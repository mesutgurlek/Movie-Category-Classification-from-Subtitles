Just a little something.

(Sydney) I was only nine when my mom died,

38
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,916
which means my formative years
were left up to my dad.

39
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,753
Being a plumber did give him
a certain unique perspective...

That's not right. Uh...

Fallopian. These are your...

Let's just call them your lady tubes.
All right?

45

00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:49,620
But sometimes, a girl just needs her mom.

51
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:13,645
(Dad) Sydney!
Time to get a move on, sweetheart!

52

Wow.

53
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,356
If your mom was here,
she'd know exactly what to say.

54
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:30,226
She'd be so excited you're going to her school,
gonna join her sorority.

But since I can't be,
I've put some of my favorite memories in this box.

Live every moment, Sydney.

67

Grab every opportunity.

68
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,466
And have fun in everything you do.

69
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,766
The friends you meet in college
will be your friends for life.

70
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:49,572
Perhaps you'll fill this box with your own memories
to pass on to your daughter someday.

71
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,009
And know that though I can't be there with you now,

163
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,259
(whimpers)

164
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:53,429
You better keep this.
You clearly need the practice!

165
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,797
(boy) Whoa, dude!

166
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,807
Come on, Dinks.

167
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,474
You do realize you just showed up
the school's tight end?

168
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,975
I hope he's second string.

169
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,312
Tyler Prince.
Beta president.

170
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,620
Sydney White.
No title.

171
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,156
Sorry.
This is Dinky.

172
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,959
But we're gonna be late
to our first rush party, so if you'll excuse us...

173
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,666
Oh, um,
maybe he could help us find our way.

174
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,641
We're going to Kappa.
Mm-hm.

175
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:35,203
All right, ladies.
Let me be your Greek guide.

176
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,640
Each house has a reputation.

177
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,709
There's the Gamma Phis.

178
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,590
They're, uh... perky.
(all squeal)

179
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,715
Very perky.
Lots of cheerleaders.

180
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,388
And here's Pi Beta Omega.

181
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,711
Those girls can out-party
any fraternity on campus.

182
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:57,293
What was the first house?
The one with the Junior Tiger Guide?

183
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,763
Uh, that would be the Vortex.
That's a weird name for a fraternity.

184
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,133
It's not a fraternity.
It started off as overflow student housing.

185
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,353
Now it's just kinda there.

186
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,811
Here's our stop.
Kappa Phi Nu.

187
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,552
Well, thank you for the tour, Tyler.
Yeah, th...

188
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,021
Sydney, you know what?
I'm gonna meet you inside.

189
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,656
Why?

190
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,666
(mouths words)

191
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,931
The illegally blondes...
You? Really?

192
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,967
Yeah.
I... Is it the shoes?

193
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,470
(chuckles) No.
I love the shoes.

194
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,880
The Kappas are just a little... intense.

195
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,142
Oh, well,
it was actually my mother's house.

196
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,880
Ah. Legacy.
Is she all over you about rushing?

197
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,440
No.
She... died nine years ago.

198
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,621
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's OK.

199
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,460
Kappas could use a girl like you.
I should know - they're our sister sorority.

200
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,785
Oh!
So we'll be like brother and sister!

201
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,001
Not in, you know,
the related, familial way,

202
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,037
but, you know,
more in the fraternal, sororal...

203
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:19,541
Sororital? Is that a word?
Sorry. I kinda tend to overtalk when I'm nervous.

204
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,245
It's a disease, one without a cure.
So stop me any time, please.

205
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,689
You're nervous?
Oh... No.

206
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,350
No, it's not you.
Tyler, was it?

207
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,786
No, it's because of the whole rush,
you know?

208
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:34,089
The very term "rush" is an amper-upper.
It amps up the old nerves.

209
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,294
I have to go.

210
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:43,667
(chatter)

211
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,643
OK, ladies.
Listen up.

212
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,772
The doors are about to open.
Our objective is?

213
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,840
(all) Target cute pledges.

214
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,510
Exactly.
And what do we want to avoid?

215
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,545
(all) Fat losers.

216
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,281
Now, now.
We all remember the code.

217
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,218
When I ask you to show a girl
to the "koi pond," ditch her.

218
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:08,123
We also have two legacies coming today -
Dinky Hodgekiss and Sydney White.

219
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,126
When you meet them,
find me immediately.

220
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,136
OK, girls.
Are we ready?

221
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,700
(all chant)
Here comes a Kappa, queen of the Row.

222
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,003
She's hot, she's cool, she ain't no ho.

223
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,005
She's got style, she's got class,

224
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,314
and from behind a kicking...

225
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,014
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

226
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,525
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

227
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,385
Excuse me, Amy.
Don't you remember?

228
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,121
You've been reassigned.
Kitchen duty.

229
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,131
Go on.

230
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:49,064
That's what happens when you gain 27 pounds
of breakup weight over the summer.

231
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,134
(all chant)
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

232
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,836
(screaming)

233
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,838
Kappa! (giggles)
Kappa! Kappa!

234
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,042
Hey.

235
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,609
Kappa! Kappa! Kappa!

236
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,687
(chanting continues)

237
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,358
Hey!

238
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,055
We've been dating for two years.
I love him so much!

239
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,785
And next week,
he's gonna pin me.

240
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,234
Pin you to what?

241
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,610
Hi.
Hi.

242
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,399
(girl) Hi there.
Oh, hi.

243
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,400
I'm Katy and this is Christy.

244
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,233
I'm Sydney White.

245
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:03,003
You're one of our legacies.
Rachel's gonna be so excited!

246
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,342
Rachel, we'd like you
to meet someone.

247
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,811
Oh...

248
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,119
Hi.

249
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,415
Girls, why don't you show
this one the koi pond?

250
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,683
Ooh! I love koi ponds.

251
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,025
Great.
Off you go.

252
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,922
This is Sydney White.

253
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,833
Three words - Leg-a-cy

254
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,695
Sydney, so pleased to meet you.

255
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,099
I'm so excited.
My mom had a great experience here.

256
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,802
Katy, have you offered our guest a drink
from the refreshment table?

257
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,738
I'm actually not that thirst...
No, no. Katy.

258
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,216
The refreshment table?

259
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:47,483
We have a situation.
That girl is not Kappa material.

260
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,352
(Christy) Really?
I didn't see anything wrong with her.

261
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,355
Christy, you know you're not
as perceptive as I am.

262
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,691
She wouldn't know
her Gucci from her Pucci.

263
00:18:55,701 --> 00:19:00,295
Not to mention, I saw her throwing herself
all over Tyler before she came in the house.

264
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:06,595
It was embarrassing. Trust me,
we do not want a Kappa who behaves that way.

265
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,472
See what I mean?

266
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,307
But we have to give her a bid.
She's a legacy.

267
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:21,107
Her mom gets her the bid,
but she has to survive pledging all on her own.

268
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:38,200
Oh, my gosh. I saw him outside,
and he is definitely the hottest guy on campus.

269
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,736
Who's the hottest guy on campus?

270
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,438
Tyler Prince,
the Beta president.

271
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,074
Oh, you know, I know that guy.
He was really nice.

272
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,143
He showed me around Greek Row.

273
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,953
Off limits. He's Rachel's boyfriend.
Oh.

274
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,283
Yeah, they're off now,
but they'll be on again.

275
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,752
It's all part of
Rachel's 20-year plan.

276
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,288
He'll be a top litigator,
she'll be a senator.

277
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:02,524
It's so romantic.
Yeah, it does sound romantic.

278
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,628
Because there it nothing more romantic
than a 20-year plan. Am I right, ladies?

279
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,638
(laughs)

280
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,603
So, Sydney,
where does your dad work?

281
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,638
Oh, he works mostly on construction sites.
Oh.

282
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:21,677
My uncle's made a mint building malls.
So, your dad's a developer, too?

283
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:24,918
Yeah...
something like that.

284
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,385
(Rachel) Night, girls.
Get your beauty rest.

285
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,956
Now that you're Kappa pledges,
it's a requirement.

286
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,732
(all) # Lay you down, dear sweet pledge

287
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:41,500
# Lay your head on the pillow

288
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:45,009
# May you have lovely dreams

289
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,274
# Just as lovely as you are

290
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,015
(all) Shh.

291
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,325
(Sydney)
Has anyone found the koi pond?

292
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,164
(airhorns blasting)

293
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,270
It's 1 2:01!
Welcome to hell, skanks!

294
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:25,474
Over the next week, we'll be conducting
what I like to call..."pledge enlightenment."

295
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:31,179
We're not allowed to call it "hazing,"
not after what happened to Suzie.

296
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:36,518
We're gonna find out which of you
Prada princesses has what it takes to be a Kappa,

297
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,320
and which of you don't.

298
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,523
This is your first pledge task -
the date dash.

299
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:45,961
You have until 1 2:1 5 to find a date
and meet me at the State Street Diner.

300
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:51,241
No changing clothes, no makeup,
no brushing your hair or teeth!

301
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,375
You have 15 minutes!
Let's go!

302
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,072
Go! Go!

303
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,176
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

304
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,521
(girl) Come on!

305
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,353
Dinky! Dinky! What do we do?
Oh, you just grab a guy.

306
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:15,457
Excuse me, sugar.
Can I borrow you for a date dash?

307
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,659
(laughs) Hurry up, girl. Come on.
OK.

308
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,669
Come on!

309
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,435
(boy) Ah-choo!

310
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,270
Hello? Hello?!

311
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,305
Uh... Oh, uh, sorry.

312
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,107
I'm sorry. Uh...

313
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:35,544
Hi. Uh... I'm sorry I startled you.
Can you...? Can you help me?

314
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,554
Ah-choo!
OK.

315
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:41,917
Thanks.
Sure.

316
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,453
Ah-choo! Oh, sorry.
Sorry, thanks.

317
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:46,755
What are you doing
in a, uh, bush?

318
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:51,259
I don't know what happened. I was walking home
and this crazed pack of girls came toward me.

319
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,269
So I dove for cover.

320
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,432
Yeah, vision not impaired.
Sense of balance restored.

321
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,835
Feeling in fingers and toes.
No visible...

322
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:03,042
Wait!
You're a guy, right?

323
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,345
(uncertainly) Yeah.

324
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:09,111
What are you doing now?
I'm waiting for an antihistamine to take effect.

325
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,179
I need you to be my date.

326
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,555
(laughs)
Your date?

327
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,650
Yeah.
Let's go.

328
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,087
Oh, um, watch out.
When I get this excited, I tend to throw up.

329
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,327
It's OK. Just tell me when to duck.
OK.

330
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,338
(Sydney) Let's go!
Oh, um, no. I... I...

331
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,782
(plates clatter)

332
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,082
What's good?

333
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,560
Wonderful. You just made it.

334
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,757
(Sydney) How's the BLT?

335
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,034
Mm!

336
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,670
Oh, my God.
Look at her with that pie.

337
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,570
It's a so-rority, not a ho-rority.

338
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,113
So, tell me about the Vortex.

339
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,013
What's it like?

340
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,753
Uh...

341
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:25,954
I guess you'd call it a, uh... haven,
uh, for people who don't have anywhere else to go.

342
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:31,726
Some of us didn't get along with our roommates,
some of us made others feel uncomfortable.

343
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,398
Some of us wet the bed.

344
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,768
Some of us wet the hallway.

345
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,457
Uh, all of us are outsiders.

346
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,673
Yeah, I know what that's like.

347
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,609
Uh, are you serious?
You're a Kappa pledge.

348
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,045
By definition, very much an insider.

349
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,981
Would all the Kappa pledges
join me over here for a moment?

350
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,188
OK. I guess I'll be right back.
Yes.

351
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,923
OK, girls.
It's time for your next pledge task.

352
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,333
The date-dash ditch.

353
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:07,802
This year's unsuitable date
belongs to...

354
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,499
Sydney.

355
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,335
Sorry, you're gonna
have to ditch him.

356
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,341
Ah-choo!

357
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:19,574
But my guy's really nice.
And I dragged him all the way down here.

358
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,978
And he has a sinus infection
and his athlete's foot is flaring up.

359
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,280
And he has glaucoma... he thinks.

360
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,216
I cannot just ditch him.
I don't make the rules, Sydney.

361
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:34,006
If being a Kappa is important to you,
then this is the price you pay.

362
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,204
Hey, "date."
Hey.

363
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:47,469
I ordered you
another cup of coffee.

364
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,479
Oh...

365
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,941
I need you to meet me
in the girls' bathroom.

366
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,112
Another pledge ritual.
Oh.

367
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,289
Oh. Oh.

368
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,357
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

369
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,163
OK.
I'll meet you there.

370
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,862
(door opens)

371
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:17,966
Sydney?

372
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:20,001
(both scream)

373
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,078
Pervert!
Ow!

374
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,304
Looks like you
get stuck with the check.

375
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:50,131
We live in a country that's considered to be
the ultimate model of government.

376
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:55,204
By the people,
for the people, and of the people.

377
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,675
But most Americans would be surprised to find
how afraid the Founding Fathers were

378
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:04,512
of what a direct democracy could do to the country.

379
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:08,583
Can anyone tell me why?

380
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,660
(snoring)

381
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,254
(snores)

382
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,257
The young man snoring there, perhaps?

383
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:18,267
(chuckling)

384
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,562
(coughs)

385
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,398
The Founding Fathers were afraid
that direct democracy

386
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,201
would do to America
what it did to Rome.

387
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:30,538
Alexander Hamilton
even advocated a monarchy. (snores)

388
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,340
Exactly.

389
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,311
We are trained to think
the more power the people have, the better.

390
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:42,016
Can any of you tell me
some reasons why this isn't necessarily true?

391
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:47,887
Ah, Terrence.
Still here after eight years.

392
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,993
What do you say we give someone else
a chance to respond this time, huh?

393
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:55,404
Um... Ms. Witchburn?

394
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:59,200
Most Americans
don't educate themselves about the issues.

395
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,805
There are some valid arguments
for keeping things a little bit more... elite.

396
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:08,745
You could even argue a case
for certain types of oligarchy.

397
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,350
Interesting.

398
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:15,792
Let's hear from someone else.
How about... you?

399
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,318
Ms...?

400
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,520
White.

401
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,530
Ms. White.

402
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,965
Any thoughts?

403
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,168
Um...

404
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,034
I guess I think that's...

405
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,300
underestimating the masses a bit.

406
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,710
Not to mention
overestimating the elites.

407
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:42,077
Apartheid was an oligarchy,
and no one wants that again.

408
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,087
Excellent.

409
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,561
Alicia, what year
was Kappa Phi Nu founded?

410
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,096
1902.
Very good.

411
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,841
Mm!

412
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:15,945
Want some breakfast?
Yeah.

413
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,415
Help yourself.

414
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,618
Breakfast is good.

415
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,853
(Rachel) Ugh!

416
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,589
It's called moisturizer.
Try some.

417
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,290
Next.

418
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,962
Ugh.
Your pores are enormous.

419
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,796
They have a thing
called whitening toothpaste. Next.

420
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,546
Dinky.
Kappa founder Kitty Cooper's hometown?

421
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,141
Little Rock.

422
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,151
(giggles)

423
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:51,346
Lose the big hair.
This isn't Dallas.

424
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,415
Bye.

425
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:56,221
Eyebrows... meet tweezers.

426
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,269
Tweezers,
meet your worst nightmare.

427
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,465
(chatter)
I know.

428
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,025
Next. Next.
Next. (sighs)

429
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,717
(Rachel) OK, future sisters.

430
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:11,833
Get your lazy asses up.
You're gonna clean the bathroom.

431
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,311
(all groan)

432
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,539
At the Beta fraternity house.
(all groan louder)

433
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,269
Sydney, the Kappa Phi Nu colors?

434
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,044
Green and white.
Wrong. Emerald and pearl.

435
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,246
Sorry.
I'm still learning how to speak priss.

436
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,256
(all gasp)

437
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,797
(both yelp/scream)

438
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,783
You know what?
Don't change a thing.

439
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,196
You just keep walking around
looking just like that.

440
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,336
You again.
Oh.

441
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,346
Morning.
Hi.

442
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,274
Sorry you had to do that.
Some of the girls are a little traumatized.

443
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,309
(Sydney)
Yeah. It's OK. I, uh...

444
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:31,294
I spend a lot of time in bathrooms.

445
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,017
No, no. I don't mean like that,
I just mean that, um...

446
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,786
I don't go to the bathroom a lot, l...

447
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:42,961
Well, sometimes I do.
Kinda depends on what I eat.

448
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:48,563
Just to be clear, I spend
a normal amount of time in the bathroom.

449
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,483
Sydney. It's time to get back to the house.
OK.

450
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,569
Don't ask.
We had to take her.

451
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,471
I think she's cool.

452
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,481
And cute.

453
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,376
Just admit they're cooler.
You don't know

454
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,177
what the hell you're talking about.

455
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:07,382
There is no way that a pirate
is cooler than a ninja.

456
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:12,577
Ninja's live like monks.
Pirates get booty. End of discussion.

457
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,992
Hi. I need to return these
and I have a couple of poli sci books on reserve.

458
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:22,297
I'm impressed.
I don't get a lot of pledges in here studying.

459
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,767
Well, they probably don't
have scholarships to maintain.

460
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:31,439
You and your drunken, whoring pirates
represent the lowest common denominator in society!

461
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,007
(chuckles) All right.

462
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:38,513
I think we can all agree that
a pirate-ninja would be the coolest thing ever.

463
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,481
Hi.

464
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,925
Oh, hi.

465
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,385
Hello.

466
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:48,456
I wanted to apologize
for what I did to you in the bathroom.

467
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,460
What did she do to you in the bathroom?
What did she do?

468
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:58,204
It was a stupid pledge prank
and I'm really, really sorry.

469
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:02,866
Hey, it wasn't exactly
surprising behavior for a Kappa.

470
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,116
Come on, uh, let's go.

471
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:08,184
Excuse me.

472
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:16,584
If it makes you feel any better, they threw baloney
at us while we sang Céline Dion songs!

473
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,594
(laughter)

474
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,575
Girls, it's been a long journey,
but you're almost done.

475
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:35,574
Tomorrow night is our Presents Dance
where you will be introduced as official Kappa sisters.

476
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:42,343
It's tradition for the current sisters to pass down
their Presents gowns to the new pledges.

477
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,580
After all, we're all size two.
(all giggle)

478
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,058
Except you, Amy.

479
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:51,386
As president, I will draw the first name.

480
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:55,561
This lucky girl is getting one of Milan's finest.

481
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,670
Sydney White.

482
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,276
Yay!

483
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,382
Come, Sydney.

484
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,945
(coughs)

485
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,955
(computer beeps)

486
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:25,053
Hey, Christy, why don't you check your standing?
I'm sure you've cracked the top 20 by now.

487
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,623
Uh, what's that?

488
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:31,059
Just the school's "Hot or Not" ranking
on MySpace.

489
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:35,369
It's just some dumb list.
Oh. That does sound dumb.

490
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,501
Really dumb. I bet lame people
just log on all day and vote for themselves.

491
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:43,271
No, we don't.
We're only allowed to vote once a day.

492
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,281
Right, Rachel?

493
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,876
Hey, Rach, you're still number one.

494
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:51,480
Am l? How cute.

495
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:54,649
It's been that way for forever.
You know how people are.

496
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,786
They just stick with the status quo.
That's why new people never make it on.

497
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,956
Oh, my God.
Sydney's on it - number 213.

498
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,526
I am?
Let me see that.

499
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,995
But I thought you said
new people never make it on the list.

500
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:11,998
Well, like you said,
it's just some dumb list.

501
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:16,204
But aren't we just so lucky
to have you as a pledge?

502
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:21,242
And I think you're gonna look
just gorgeous in...

503
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:29,584
Perfect. Totally you.
Practically screams number 213.

504
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,154
(cellphone rings)

505
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,394
Hey, Tyler.

506
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,162
Oh, you're so bad!

507
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,363
I have to take this.

508
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,848
(Rachel) Jenny Robinson.
(applause)

509
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,157
Dinky Hodgekiss.

510
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,433
Alicia Fairchild.

511
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,032
Bunchie Hathaway.

512
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,208
And finally, Sydney White.

513
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:31,207
I present to you this fall's
Kappa Phi Nu pledge class.

514
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:40,120
You look... incredible.

515
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,190
Thank you.
Dance?

516
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,837
(# "When I See You Smile" by Gabriel Mann)

517
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,242
Who are you, Sydney White?

518
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:57,838
You throw a football like Matt Leinart,

519
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,408
fearlessly conquer fraternity bathrooms,

520
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,148
and clean up nice, to boot.

521
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:07,248
Well, I'm more of a Peyton Manning.
Leinart's a lefty.

522
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:09,818
Marry me.
(giggles)

523
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,955
So, uh, they go all-out
for these shindigs, huh?

524
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:16,257
It's a weird word - "shindig."

525
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:19,460
You eat? Because there are some
hors d'oeuvres over there.

526
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:24,932
You know, I tried to eat a plastic flower once.
Kinda hurt. (laughs)

527
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:29,337
I'm rambling again, aren't l?
I'm starting to think I make you nervous.

528
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,138
(laughs)

529
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:33,148
No.

530
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:42,984
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

531
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,394
(applause)

532
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:52,321
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

533
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,897
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

534
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,433
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

535
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,236
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

536
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,039
You are now a Kappa sister.
You are now a Kappa sister.

537
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,508
Kappa sister...
(echoes) sister... sister...

538
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:11,173
Congratulations.
You are now a Kappa sister.

539
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,224
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm afraid we have a bit of a situation.

540
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:28,462
Every so often, it is the unfortunate duty
of the president to act as judge and jury.

541
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:32,700
Sydney White has exhibited
inappropriate Kappa behavior.

542
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,335
(audience gasps)

543
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:38,247
Is this a pledge prank?
It certainly is not.

544
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,875
You are guilty of the following infractions:

545
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:43,711
you brought an unsuitable date
to the date dash,

546
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,781
cheated during a pledge quiz,

547
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:50,251
revealed a secret pledge ritual
to the entire library,

548
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:54,197
and, finally, lied about your background.

549
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:58,326
We all know your dad
is actually a plumber.

550
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:02,596
As Kappa president,
according to statute 25A of the sorority charter,

551
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:07,451
I hereby dismiss Sydney White
from the Kappa pledge class.

552
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:15,776
I don't know what your mother got away with
when she was here,

553
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,346
but you will never be a Kappa.

554
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,465
You know what?
Thank you.

555
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:34,028
Because if this is what sisterhood's all about,
then I don't want any part of it.

556
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,506
I want that dress back.

557
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,737
Take it!
(all gasp)

558
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,221
(thunderclaps)

559
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:28,482
I will see your Cobra Commander,
and I will raise you a mint, unopened,

560
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:33,520
power of the Force,
Return of the Jedi Luke Skywalker in...

561
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,825
battle poncho.

562
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,498
Wow.

563
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,335
We fold.

564
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:54,675
Which is better?
Three A's or two of the cards with the ladies on them?

565
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,681
You dope.
What?

566
00:40:56,691 --> 00:40:59,380
If you have both, it's a full house.

567
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:04,685
How is it you always win at cards, but you can't make
it from Junior Tiger Guide to Tiger Guide?

568
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:08,187
It's one badge, OK?
It's one badge.

569
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,995
Knots are hard.

570
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:15,329
Does anyone know another word for
"douchebaggery"? I don't want to use it a third time.

571
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:19,070
Gurkin, no one reads
your whiny blog anyway.

572
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:25,008
Peoplespunisher.com is not about being read.
It's about being written.

573
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,418
(electric crackling)

574
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,593
Good morning, Embele.

575
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,466
(laughs, speaks African language)

576
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,060
Where do you think he goes?

577
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,070
(rainfall)

578
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:54,869
Outside, a lady waits.
She wears jean pants and looks very sad. (yawns)

579
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,007
There's a girl outside? Yes!

580
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,516
Am I looking good? Yes.

581
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,584
(yawns)

582
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:07,824
(gasps)
Oh, it's the bathroom babe!

583
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:12,653
I'm gonna go work the Spanky magic.

584
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:16,598
(sobs)

585
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,616
Ahem!

586
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,714
Sorry. You probably don't
want me sitting out here.

587
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:42,950
And I understand, especially you.

588
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,870
And you were right
about the whole Kappa thing.

589
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,793
I'll go.

590
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:55,254
Did they really make you
sing Céline Dion?

591
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,539
Yeah.

592
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,937
Do you need a place to stay?

593
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:14,249
Guys, this is Sydney.

594
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,383
Uh, she needs a place to stay.

595
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,878
She gave up her dorm room
to pledge Kappa.

596
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,423
Sydney, these are the guys.

597
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,731
Gurkin.

598
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,833
Terrence.

599
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,539
George.

600
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,039
Jeremy.

601
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,512
Don't forget me.
Oh, of course. Skoozer.

602
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:41,075
(whispers) Jeremy's shy.
He had several therapists as a kid.

603
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:44,612
One of them recommended a puppet.
He never stopped using it.

604
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,381
You'll get used to Skoozer.
Yeah, it's OK.

605
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,450
As long as he doesn't
hump my bunny slippers.

606
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,551
No promises.

607
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,086
(laughs)
(barks)

608
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,621
(small explosion)

609
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,263
Uh... Ah.

610
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:05,199
That's Embelackpo Akimbatunde.
We just call him Embele.

611
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:08,435
He's from Nigeria
and hasn't adjusted to the time change.

612
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:11,438
His days and nights
are actually reversed.

613
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:14,338
Jet lag, huh?
When did he get here?

614
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:17,445
Three years ago.

615
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,246
Thank you.

616
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:23,022
Of course!
I have to invert the ratio.

617
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,729
Come on, Bilbo.

618
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:33,226
And what exactly is he doing?
We have no idea.

619
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,738
Welcome to the Vortex.

620
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,854
(coughs)

621
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,096
(boy) Sydney?
Oh, hi. Come in.

622
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,640
Hi. Uh...

623
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:16,370
I'm sorry. I know it can be a little spooky up here
at night, so I brought you this.

624
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:22,148
That night light has gotten me
through some pretty tough times.

625
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,518
Oh.
Thanks, that's really sweet.

626
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,817
Hey, is that Dark Fury number four?
Yeah.

627
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:34,088
The one with the first appearance of...
(both) The Emerald Mask.

628
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:38,559
You know, you may be
more Vortex than Kappa after all.

629
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,528
So, uh, are you all set?
Do you need anything?

630
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:45,699
A hypoallergenic pillow?
Humidifier? Dehumidifier? Ionizer?

631
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:48,502
Nope. I think I'm all good
on the medical-supply front.

632
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,405
Are you sure?
There's a lot of dust.

633
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,608
I've actually got loads of allergy medicine.

634
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,077
You? Allergies?
I never would've guessed.

635
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,013
Just the usual -
dairy, wheat, peanuts.

636
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,382
Bee stings, cats...
Wow, that's a lot of...

637
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,587
Pollen, wood...

638
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:10,491
A few others.
Uh, but it's getting late. You're probably tired.

639
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:14,661
Well, yeah.
Public humiliation can be pretty tiring.

640
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,139
Yeah, I know.

641
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:21,335
Oh, um, I don't know
if you need any sort of special...

642
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,669
lady products.

643
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,445
No, no.
I'm good. Thanks, though.

644
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:28,982
Thanks for everything, Lenny.

645
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,145
Hey. (chuckles)

646
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:35,387
I don't know if you, uh...
need to do anything...

647
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,050
Spanky, go.

648
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,056
(groans)

649
00:46:39,066 --> 00:46:42,256
Sorry about that. Um...
Let me know if he bothers you.

650
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:48,501
Spanky's kind of... Well, he really likes girls,
but he doesn't know many.

651
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,040
But he keeps himself happy.

652
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:56,703
You may find this hard to believe, but, um, most of
the guys here don't have a lot of experience with girls.

653
00:46:56,713 --> 00:47:00,793
(# "Also Sprach Zarathustra" by Richard Strauss)

654
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:09,521
Dudes... that thing has touched boobs.

655
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,555
Of course.

656
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,724
The sturdy, breathable fabric
is designed to maintain mammary elasticity.

657
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:22,467
Shut up, Terrence!
You're ruining the moment for me.

658
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:28,543
(phone rings)

659
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:38,619
Hello.
Oh, hey, Dad. Did I wake you?

660
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,429
What? Are you kidding?
How was the big dance?

661
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,823
That's actually why I was calling.

662
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:50,757
Well, come on.
I've been waiting up to hear. Tell me all about it.

663
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:54,794
It was great.
Yeah, it's all very exciting.

664
00:47:54,872 --> 00:48:00,033
Sydney, I'm sure that your mom is right there
taking it all in with you.

665
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,043
I know.

666
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:05,172
(sighs) That's what I keep thinking.

667
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:09,651
Good night, sweetie.
Night, Dad.

668
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,967
Oh!

669
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:31,038
Um... this place is a deathtrap.

670
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,872
How about some repairs?

671
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,636
Sydney, don't start.

672
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,804
You know why we can't
get any damn repairs?

673
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:43,218
I'll tell you why.
Campus wide systematic Greek oppression.

674
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:47,814
Read peoplespunisher.com if you wanna know more.
I did a whole series on it.

675
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:51,952
I don't know what needing repairs
has to do with the Greek system. It isn't Greek.

676
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:56,757
Precisely! That's the problem. Rachel Witchburn
and the Greeks run the student council.

677
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:01,357
The student council dictates
all budget appropriations.

678
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:06,199
Over the past 1 4 semesters,
87.3% of all campus-event funding

679
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:09,354
has been devoted to the Greek system.

680
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:12,646
Are you kidding me?

681
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,716
I don't kid. (gurgling)

682
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,677
Ooh.

683
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:19,053
Won't be long now.

684
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:25,752
Why is everyone on this campus
willing to let Rachel Witchburn run their lives?

685
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:28,861
'Cause she... she's kind of...

686
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,932
scary.

687
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,766
Hey, Rachel!

688
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:42,006
Check it out.
The diet's working. I lost 5 pounds.

689
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,825
I think your ass found it.

690
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,676
(Tyler) Hey!

691
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:51,813
Hey! Sydney.

692
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,821
Sydney.

693
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,152
Hi.
Listen, about last night...

694
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,488
Last night?
Hm, wait, let me think.

695
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,925
Oh, yeah!
When your girlfriend humiliated me.

696
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:07,995
Good times.
Trust me, Rachel's not my girlfriend.

697
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,397
And not everyone in Greek Row
is like her.

698
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,867
Give me a chance to prove that to you.
(girl) Run for student council!

699
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:19,039
You know, I'm actually kinda busy...
juggling seven guys at the moment.

700
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,340
So...
Whoa.

701
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,875
I gotta go.

702
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,680
Hey, can I have a sign-up sheet?
Yeah.

703
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,985
Actually, can I have seven?

704
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,932
Oh!

705
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:40,093
Don't worry, ladies.

706
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:45,198
We won't have to deal with the public once
the Vortex is torn down and my Greek Center's built.

707
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,208
(cellphone beeps)
Oh.

708
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:49,837
Is it four o'clock already?

709
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,772
Loser, loser,

710
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,778
Kappa, Kappa,

711
00:50:53,788 --> 00:50:55,945
Kappa, lose...

712
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,914
What?!

713
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,857
This isn't happening.

714
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:07,771
Wow. I guess her little
striptease act got some attention.

715
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:11,962
(hyperventilates)

716
00:51:11,972 --> 00:51:13,994
(Christy) Rachel? Rachel.

717
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,529
Use your soothing words.

718
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,540
Prada, Gucci,

719
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:22,169
Chanel...

720
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,009
Sydney, Sydney, Sydney!
Ugh!

721
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,082
Whoa!

722
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:34,987
(Lenny) Hey.
Hey, guys.

723
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,528
There you go.

724
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:44,458
I've found a way for you
to get the Vortex repaired.

725
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:49,993
We're signing you up
to run for student council, all seven of you.

726
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,807
(all laugh)

727
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:59,399
Very funny, Sydney.
Next you'll tell us Admiral Adama's a Cylon.

728
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,845
I have no idea what you just said.
But I'm serious.

729
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:09,349
You'll all run on a ticket
and you'll take over the entire student council.

730
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:14,228
No non-Greek has won
a student-council office since 1992.

731
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:17,017
And look where that's gotten us.

732
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:20,229
Ow.
Yes, George, ow.

733
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,395
We've taken enough of their abuse.

734
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:26,032
I'll be your campaign manager
and I'll be with you every step of the way.

735
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,801
I am in.

736
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:31,211
Good. Who else is with me?
Come on, guys.

737
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:37,711
Do you really wanna spend the rest of college locked
up in this crap hole, disenfranchised and powerless?

738
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,146
OK.

739
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,647
No! George, no.

740
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,116
You don't wanna be powerless.
No.

741
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,560
Please don't give up.

742
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:52,325
Did the Avengers give up when the Black Knight
sprayed New York with that foam?

743
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,894
No.
No.

744
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:58,598
With the help of a criminal glue specialist,
they freed everyone.

745
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:01,902
I'm your criminal glue specialist!
Yeah!

746
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:04,506
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

747
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,606
Who's running for president?
Not it.

748
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,241
Not it.
Not it.

749
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,971
(speaks African language)
(sighs)

750
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:19,888
Oh. I never win at that game.

751
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:22,722
Terrence it is.
Let's get started!

752
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:25,724
(# "Revolution" by The Veronicas)

753
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,614
So...?

754
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,620
Hm...

755
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,192
Mm-hm...

756
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,131
Mm. Nice.

757
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:27,260
Loop in, and then you've got a bow.

758
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:31,065
I did it!
Oh, you did it, yes!

759
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:37,905
Hey, Terrence.

760
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,582
Bye, Terrence.

761
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,781
This is the gym.

762
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,041
A lot of people hang out here.

763
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:25,879
We can work off some of those doughnuts
and maybe even talk to a few people.

764
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,153
I... I don't know.

765
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:31,651
Come on. It's a Saturday afternoon.
What else would you be doing?

766
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:37,016
Oh, we always do play fantasy video games
and then reenact them.

767
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,735
(incantation)

768
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,566
Are you not entertained?

769
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:49,669
Mm, tempting.
But I think we're gonna stick with this.

770
00:55:57,554 --> 00:56:02,115
Oh, l-I can't do it. My arms ache.
I think I may have muscular dystrophy.

771
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,390
Muscular dystrophy is a birth defect.

772
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,657
Lenny, they're 2 pounds.

773
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:10,131
Each.

774
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,227
You got it?
(muffled grunt)

775
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:17,536
What?
I said yeah, I got... Ow!

776
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:27,640
Damn, Embele, you're going to town.
Where'd you get all that energy?

777
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,948
I just awaken an hour ago.

778
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,019
(laughs)

779
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,860
It's OK. You'll be fine.
It fell on my foot.

780
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:51,831
(man) Rachel Witchburn has led the student council
to great heights over the past two years.

781
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,067
In addition to repaving Greek Row,

782
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:59,606
Rachel beautified Greek Row's grounds
and expanded parking privileges for Greek Row.

783
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:04,610
Re-elect Rachel Witchburn.
Vision. Leadership. Progress.

784
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:08,515
I'm Rachel Witchburn
and I approved this message.

785
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,984
Can you believe that?
Who would fall for that?

786

You're the first girl I've met
I thought would appreciate this place.

940
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:13,739
Well, I do, even if there was
no bathroom attendant.

941
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:17,207
I had to turn the faucet myself.
(laughs)

942
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:21,648
(Tyler) Here we are.

943
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,153
All right. Well...

944
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,119
Thank you.

945
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:29,290
I had a great time.

946
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:37,565
(laughs) You're trying not to overtalk
right now, aren't you?

947
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:53,153
Whoa-a!

948
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,723
I'm OK. My spleen broke my fall.

949
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:06,730
Hi, guys.
Hey.

950
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:11,562
Sydney. What a surprise.
Um, we were just watching the...

951
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:16,567
The game?
Mm-hm.

952
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:19,705
Yeah, who's playing?
Um, the...

953
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:23,513
St Louis Gorillas.

954
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:28,147
You guys were spying on me. And just for that,
I'm not gonna tell you about my date.

955
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:30,523
Oh, come on, Sydney.
Nope.

956
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:34,058
Good night, boys.

957
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:36,427
(groans)
Oh, man.

958
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:39,682
I should probably
see a doctor.

959
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,167
Hey, sexy.

960
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,202
Rachel, what the hell
are you doing here?

961
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:53,606
Besides reading
your boring emails, nothing.

962
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:57,016
Tell me what you were
doing out with her.

963
01:10:58,153 --> 01:11:02,403
You know what, Rachel?
I like Sydney. Deal with it.

964
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:06,852
I don't care if you like her or not.
All I care about is our Greek Life Center.

965
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:09,922
Sydney and her band of goobers
are screwing with our plans.

966
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:13,058
It's not like they have a shot
at winning the election.

967
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,194
I think we should
just leave them alone.

968
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:18,697
I mean, that dump is obviously
really important to them.

969
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:23,102
I don't know why anyone would wanna live there.
That firetrap should be condemned.

970
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:28,467
Look, we can find another location.
Now, get outta here already.

971
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:31,877
One date and you're ready
to blow the whole deal?

972
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,185
It was a hell of a date.

973
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:38,550
Normally I'd be reporting that Rachel Witchburn...
Guys, look!

974
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,620
...once again has a lock
on the student council presidency.

975
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:48,060
But now there's a new player on the scene - Terrence
Lubinecki and his Freedom to the 7th Power party.

976
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:52,064
Do they have a shot?
Can they even make a dent? Stay tuned.

977
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:55,467
(laughter, cheering)
You're a good-looking guy.

978
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:58,971
Check it out.
Maybe I'll actually vote this year.

979
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,981
Yeah, cool.

980
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:12,451
Hey, Rach. Which of these should I wear?
I don't care.

981
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,486
But I have a date.
I don't care.

982
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:19,158
Come to my room and help me get dressed.
What is wrong with you?

983
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,760
Rachel, you can't come in here.
I just farted.

984
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:24,295
Ew, Katy. You're disgusting.

985
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:34,312
(slow motion) No!

986
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:35,974
(Rachel screams)

987
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:38,350
Get off me, you freaks!
No!

988
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,911
Rach...

989
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,820
What?

990
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,254
No.

991
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:55,203
No!

992
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:59,478
Rachel, do you wanna try
your soothing words?

993
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:06,305
I don't need my soothing words.
It's all become very clear to me.

994
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:10,217
Sydney White must die a social death

995
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:13,220
and take her seven dorks with her.

996
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:19,323
(knock at door)

997
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:23,195
Great. Here comes
Prince Charming.

998
01:13:23,265 --> 01:13:26,792
Guys, please. Just give him a chance.
(gun clicks)

999
01:13:26,802 --> 01:13:31,052
That means you, Gurkin.
Put the paintball gun away.

1000
01:13:34,209 --> 01:13:36,803
Hi. Come on in.
Hi.

1001
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,650
Hi.

1002
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:45,986
Hi.

1003
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:51,049
Are you ready?
I have a better idea.

1004
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:53,519
We all hang here at the Vortex
and order pizza.

1005
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:56,020
What?

1006
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,098
(whimpers)

1007
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,162
Sounds good to me.

1008
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:06,465
Hey, is that Medal of Honor?.
(Gurkin) No, it's not Medal of Honor.

1009
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:11,503
Medal of Honor is for wusses.
It's Gurkin of Honor. I made it.

1010
01:14:11,513 --> 01:14:16,575
It pays tribute to Medal of Honor,
God of War, Halo and Viva Piñata.

1011
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:21,413
I'm pretty good at all those games.
You mind if I give it a shot?

1012
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:22,981
OK.

1013
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:25,050
(laughter)

1014
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,127
Shh!

1015
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,700
(growls)

1016
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:46,972
Oh!

1017
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:48,982
Eat lead, sucker.

1018
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:52,244
Gurkin, damn,
he just kicked your ass. Nice.

1019
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:57,249
I have to say, I'm impressed. None of these freaks
have come close to winning Gurkin of Honor.

1020
01:14:57,259 --> 01:15:00,592
We Betas play video games, too.
You do?

1021
01:15:00,662 --> 01:15:05,891
Yeah. What did you think we do?
Just have sex with girls all the time.

1022
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:10,128
I hate to break it to you, Spanky,
but we're really just regular guys.

1023
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:14,566
Aw. He's like a kid who just found out
there's no Santa Claus.

1024
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,840
What?

1025
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:20,639
I mean, hypothetically, you know,
if there weren't a Santa Claus,

1026
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,944
which, of course, there is.

1027
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:29,781
You guys should come hang out sometime.
Bring Gurkin of Honor.

1028
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:34,353
You know, actually, we're having a party
tomorrow night. You guys wanna come?

(# "Breakin' Dishes" by Rihanna)

1030

You made it. Uh, the bar's over there

1031
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:57,809
and the DJ's taking requests.

1032

Do you think he has
the Dr. Who theme song?

1033

I'm thinking not.
That's OK.

1034

I brought my own.

Oh, yeah. We've been watching you.
Where have you studs been hiding?

1073
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:23,789
The building at the end of the road.
It's called the Vortex 'cause it sucks in losers.

Sounds like a party to me.

that leads right to it.

01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:56,448
Since you're the mastermind behind
their adorable little student council campaign,

1095
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,617
let me be the first to break the news.

1096
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,720
Terrence is disqualified
from running for president.

1097
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,688
What are you talking about?

1098
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:07,025
Terrence Lubinecki is not a student
at Southern Atlantic.

1099
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,663
He graduated six years ago.

1100
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:15,400
I had to stay. There was
just so much more learning to do.

1101
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:19,660
Terrence, maybe you should
put on some clothes. OK.

1102
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:24,309
Rachel, why don't you get the hell outta here?
Ooh, I love it when you get rough.

1103
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:28,980
And, Ty, thanks for playing your part so well.
That's the other good news.

1104
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:32,317
The Witchburn-Prince Greek Life Center
is now a reality.

1105
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:35,520
Witchburn-Prince? What the hell...?
You didn't tell her?

1106
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:39,524
I thought you guys were so close.
It's a little joint project of ours

1107
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:42,194
and the only thing standing in our way
was the Vortex.

1108
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:44,329
So, like you suggested, Tyler,

1109
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:47,308
I went ahead
and had it condemned.

1110
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:51,269
Now you can eat
with the homeless every night.

1111
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,084
You had something
to do with this?

1112
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:57,275
No. I mean, I said the place
was a dump, but I didn't...

1113
01:20:57,285 --> 01:21:02,385
Witchburn-Prince, huh?
So you wanted to tear down the Vortex.

1114
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:05,717
Yeah, I did, but...
I don't wanna hear it.

1115
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:07,727
Sydney!
No.

1116
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,523
Don't grovel, Tyler.

1117
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,600
You're above it.

1118
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:24,236
Things are looking grim,
brothers.

1119
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:27,875
I am so sorry about this,
you guys.

1120
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,575
You should've just left us alone.

1121
01:21:30,585 --> 01:21:34,312
We were fine until you came along
and made us your guinea pigs.

1122
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:37,983
You guys... It's so important
for us to stand up to the Greeks

1123
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:41,753
and show them that
they can't trample all over us.

1124
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:46,523
Well, it's also important for us
to have a place to live.

1125
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,412
(phone rings)

1126
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:06,177
Hello?
Dad?

1127
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:11,449
(laughs) Got you. You've reached Royal Plumbing
at the White House. No, not that one.

1128
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:15,587
This is Paul and Sydney's. Leave a message.
(beep)

1129
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:18,088
Hi, Dad. I was just calling

1130
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:20,999
to say... I miss you.

1131
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:25,837
And that's it. Um...

1132
01:22:25,907 --> 01:22:30,003
Everything's great here. Really great.

1133
01:22:30,078 --> 01:22:32,078
I love you.

1134
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:24,356
It was that message last night. I could tell something
wasn't right. I could hear it in your voice.

1135
01:23:24,366 --> 01:23:27,926
So I got in the van
and I drove all through the night.

1136
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:31,963
I was a little surprised to find
you weren't at the Kappa house, though.

1137
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:35,636
I wanted to tell you
so many times but...

1138
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:40,579
I kept thinking about Mom
and I felt like I'd failed her.

1139
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:43,975
And you always sounded
so proud of me on the phone.

1140
01:23:43,985 --> 01:23:49,714
Sweetheart, following in your mother's footsteps
is not about reliving her life.

1141
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:53,351
It's about being
the same kind of person she was.

1142
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,253
Hey.

1143
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:58,663
Your mom was much more
than just a Kappa.

1144
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:04,295
She was a woman who always fought
for what she believed in, and so are you.

1145
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:07,332
Nothing could make me
prouder than that.

1146
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:12,270
Not even when I installed
that water filtration system in under an hour?

1147
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,771
That was pretty great.

1148
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:17,583
(laughs)

1149
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:31,631
(knock at door)

1150
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:33,958
(grunts)

1151
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:36,562
But it says, "Do not disturb."

1152
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:38,638
(knocking continues)

1153
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:47,471
Up and at 'em, guys.

1154
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,015
It's time to make some plans.

1155
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:56,281
I know you're still pissed at me, but come on.
Are you gonna wallow here in this fleabag motel

1156
01:24:56,291 --> 01:25:03,686
because some prissy girly-girl who probably
doesn't know who Gandalf is screwed us over?

1157
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:10,736
You're right.
I bet she doesn't know who Gandalf is.

1158
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,968
(laughter)

1159
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:19,704
We're still mad at you, though.
That's OK. I want you to be mad.

1160
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:23,341
I want you to get fired up
so we can win this election,

1161
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,377
because the Freedom to the 7th Power
party will prevail.

1162
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:29,957
Yeah!
With our new candidate for president.

1163
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,992
Me. I'm gonna run against Rachel.

1164
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,829
And we're gonna take her down.

1165
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:43,461
(# "Stand Up" by Mêlée)

1166
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:46,998
I'm Sydney White
and I'm running for student council president...

1167
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:52,470
I'm Sydney White and I'm running for student council
president on the Freedom to the 7th Power ticket.

1168
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:57,775
Your papers count for three quarters of
your final grade and no late papers will be accepted.

1169
01:25:57,785 --> 01:26:02,714
As you're writing these papers, I want you to think
about the mechanics of modern campaigning.

1170
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:06,351
You may be wondering why you should even care.
Why bother voting?

1171
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:09,854
The Greeks win every year
and it's one more way they run the school.

1172
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:14,159
There's a whole lot of talk today
about the need to cater to your base,

1173
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:18,596
but there's something to be said
for thinking outside of that box.

1174
01:26:18,606 --> 01:26:22,098
(Sydney) Freedom to the 7th Power!

1175
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:25,237
Whoo-hoo!
Freedom to the 7th Power!

1176
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:29,415
(man) Good job.

1177
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:35,147
(groans)

1178
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:41,419
The fact is that 80% of the student body
at Southern Atlantic is not Greek. 80%.

1179
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:46,024
Take the Kennedy campaign in 1 960.
He was inherently an outsider -

1180
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:51,196
a Catholic had never been elected as president -
who reached out to other outsiders.

1181
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:53,416
(students chant in Hebrew)

1182
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:59,539
L'chaim.
L'chaim.

1183
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:04,969
(Sydney) To those students I say,
it's time for you to be heard.

1184
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:11,304
(Carlton) Minorities, women, the poor -

1185
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:16,628
the disenfranchised won
that election for John Kennedy.

1186
01:27:21,302 --> 01:27:26,137
"Naked Pain."
An epic poem in 1 2 parts.

1187
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:33,338
It's time for you to be heard,
and we are here to listen.

1188
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:35,348
(cheering)

1189
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,821
(chanting in Hebrew)

1190
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:48,324
It's a lesson worth remembering.

1191
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:56,335
Whoo-hoo!

1192
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:18,524
(cheering)

1193
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:31,629
(Rachel) Here you go.
Don't vote for Sydney White.

1194
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:36,334
Let's keep it Greek, all right?
Does this look like your next president?

1195
01:28:36,344 --> 01:28:38,344
Vote Rachel Witchburn.

1196
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:41,747
Hi, ho.

1197
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,617
Bye, ho.

1198
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:51,567
Don't vote for Sydney White.
Vote Rachel Witchburn. Rachel Witchburn.

1199
01:29:03,938 --> 01:29:06,998
No way. You read
peoplespunisher too?

1200
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:08,900
I write it.

1201
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:12,103
Oh, my God.
It's the most genius thing ever.

1202
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:15,940
Did you know that the Brew House has
a spoken-word night devoted to that blog?

1203
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:18,418
Really?
Yeah.

1204
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:21,546
And I know
this is really embarrassing,

1205
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:26,823
but I swore that if I ever met
the peoplespunisher guy,

1206
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:29,761
well, I'd hook up with him.

1207
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,396
Dammit!

1208
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:44,708
Need some help?

1209
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:47,313
Oh. Hi.

1210
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:50,908
Listen, I'm really...

1211
01:29:50,918 --> 01:29:55,446
Is that a Stanley 22 ounce
AntiVibe framing hammer?

1212
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:59,050
Yes, it is.
Can I touch it?

1213
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:02,923
You can have it.

1214
01:30:03,965 --> 01:30:08,470
I saw you guys with the signs.
I thought I could help.

1215
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:13,097
And I'm really sorry about
what happened the other night.

1216
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:15,366
I had nothing to do with
what Rachel pulled.

1217
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:19,704
Yeah, I was involved in the Greek Center,
but Rachel twisted everything around.

1218
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:22,264
Yeah. I know what that's like.

1219
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,260
You're gonna do great
at the debate tomorrow.

1220
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,359
(heavy rock music)

1221
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:58,231
I thought we might
do a little business.

1222
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,520
Huh.

1223
01:31:09,397 --> 01:31:12,457
I thought you finished Carlton's paper last week.
I did.

1224
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,893
I wanted to add some of the ideas
from our campaign.

1225
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:18,269
You really are a dork.

1226
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:32,396
What just happened? Make it come back.
I don't...

1227
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:35,882
She just opened it.

1228
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:38,949
Voilá. One poisoned Apple.

1229
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,888
(groans)

1230
01:31:43,898 --> 01:31:45,790
(computer voice) Self-destruct.

1231
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,064
(Lenny) Oh, my God.

1232
01:31:48,135 --> 01:31:50,296
Oh, no.

1233
01:31:55,543 --> 01:31:57,704
All right, pay up.

1234
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,516
Yes!

1235
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:09,818
She's gone catatonic.

1236
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:13,588
It's no use.
Even I can't fix this.

1237
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:16,653
My paper, due tomorrow.

1238
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,858
The debate, tomorrow.

1239
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:21,292
The guy definitely
knew what he was doing.

1240
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:24,032
(Terrence) What about...? Ow.

1241
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:26,631
I can't let her win like this.

1242
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:29,616
But the debate starts in 1 2 hours.

1243
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:34,233

I know you're tired, but you can't give up now.

Ms. Witchburn,
if you win another term as president,

1257
01:35:15,176 --> 01:35:21,513
what will you do differently?
Why fix what isn't broken?

1258
01:35:23,651 --> 01:35:27,078
This has been a great year for the university
and I am proud

1259
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:31,848
to be breaking ground
on the Greek Life Center very soon.

1269

You've been oppressed by the Greek elite

1270
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:44,622
who take everything for themselves
and leave nothing for us.

the campus a cappella group is, and why would you?

1275
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:03,073
The social and cultural landscape
is entirely run by the Greeks.

1276
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:07,478
Those guys are forced to practice
in a dank basement that's hard on their vocal cords.

Let her finish.

1279

I have met so many great
and interesting people here

1280
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:18,522
that I never would have met
if I didn't step out of my own little world.

1281
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:21,626
Before, all I wanted was to fit in.

1282
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:25,763
But I've learned that
we're all searching to fit in

1283
01:37:25,773 --> 01:37:28,065
and we... we all feel like outsiders

1284
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:30,968
and we all do things and feel things

1285
01:37:30,978 --> 01:37:35,176
that are bizarre
and unconventional and dorky.

1286

We're all dorks.

1294
01:38:16,156 --> 01:38:19,583

with a girl before.

My name's Moose. When I was 1 3

01:39:00,367 --> 01:39:03,794
I was the top-ranked male figure skater
in the state of New Jersey.

So I guess that makes me a dork.

1305

I've hated Rachel Witchburn

1306

ever since she told me I had mom arms
freshman year,

1307
01:39:19,887 --> 01:39:26,432
and I have a voodoo doll of her
in my underwear drawer and I stick pins in it.

Let's hear it for the dorks!

1313
01:40:10,104 --> 01:40:15,165
Rachel Witchburn, you've exhibited
behavior unsuitable for a Kappa.

1314
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:21,672
You've lied, manipulated and verbally abused
your sisters and fellow students.

1315

And you are just such a...

hereby strip you of the privileges
of the Kappa sisterhood.

01:40:37,998 --> 01:40:40,718
But you can't! You can't just...

We just did.

Here comes a Kappa, queen of the row.

She's hot, she's cool, she ain't no ho.

1337
01:42:45,692 --> 01:42:51,812
Hey, guys. I finally perfected
my predictive analytic probability theory.

1338
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:58,195
It can predict anything from the behavior
of amino acids in a stable isotope peptide bond

to the outcome of sporting events.
