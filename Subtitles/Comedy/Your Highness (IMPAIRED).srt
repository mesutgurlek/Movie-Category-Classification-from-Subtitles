00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:51,363
TALLIOUS: Belladonna, my dear,

168
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:53,869
why don't you delight us
with your story.

169
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:57,041
BELLADONNA: Oh, no.
It's a story of strife and sadness.

170
00:07:57,242 --> 00:08:00,336
FABIOUS: No, no, it's not.
It's a story of love.

171
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:01,671
- THADEOUS: You don't have to tell it.
- FABIOUS: Shh.

172
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,838
If she doesn't want to tell it.

173
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:05,608
FABIOUS: She will tell.
This is a table full of your loved ones.

174
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,541
BELLADONNA: Oh. Okay.

175
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:09,815
I've been held captive by Leezar

176
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,616
in the Tower of Disorder
since I was but a child.

177
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:14,021
Never knowing love nor human contact.

178
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,890
(EXHALES)
But I never gave up hope.

179
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:19,924
Singing every day, praying
that someday my hero would find me.

180
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:21,555
And I did.

181
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,964
We had just slaughtered the Cyclops.

182
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,797
(ALL CHUCKLING)
We were on our way home, and on the wind

183
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:28,802
I heard the most beautiful song.

(GIGGLES)

185
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:33,375
Fascinating, really.
May we take pause for one moment.

186
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:35,269
Yes, sir.

187
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,540
Look at Courtney's new haircut.

188
00:08:36,748 --> 00:08:39,342
Doesn't it make his head
look like the tip of a penis?

189
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,248
(LAUGHING) It's hilarious.

190
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:42,747
Thadeous, please.

191
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:44,353
What is your problem?

192
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:47,049
You, Fabious,
you're being selfish and greedy.

193
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,054
Stealing all the attentions.

194
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:51,923
Today is not just for you two.

195
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,828
Today is Thundarian's birthday.

196
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,094
Thundarian, is it your birthday?

197
00:08:57,235 --> 00:08:58,429
It's not my birthday.

198
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:00,365
It's not Thundarian's
birthday, Thadeous.

199
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:01,632
TALLIOUS: Enough, enough.

200
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,174
My heart's desire, what is this?

201
00:09:04,476 --> 00:09:07,411
No. That's a... We call that a fork,

202
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,537
and you use that for your food.

203
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:11,046
Right there. Fucking idiot.

(LAUGHING)

205

FABIOUS: Having spent years in the tower

206
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:17,313
has made her ignorant to some of
our customs and things in general.

207
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:18,747
TALLIOUS: Why, yes, of course.

208
00:09:18,857 --> 00:09:19,983
If your mother were here today,

209
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:22,355
she would be a very proud woman,
Fabious. (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)

210
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,720
FABIOUS: Thank you, Father.

211
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:27,887
Which is why I ask your permission
to marry her at once.

212
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,664
The glory of romance!

213
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,970
I call upon my criers to proclaim

214
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:36,837
that tomorrow we'll see the greatest
wedding this kingdom has ever known.

215
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:40,035
And tonight, we celebrate!

I don't like this.

220
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,470
Courtney, will you make funny faces
to entertain me?

No.

223

Never triangle face.
I hate triangle face. It scares me.

224
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:06,419
Apologies.

225

Ah.

226
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:11,114
Good evening, Your Royal Highness.

227
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:12,213
COURTNEY: Julie.

228
00:10:12,426 --> 00:10:14,257
Hello, fucking Julie.

229
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:18,056
What a wonderful,
wonderful evening, sire.

230
00:10:18,532 --> 00:10:21,023
Yet another glorious achievement

231
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:25,332
in the whole firmament of starring
moments for your brother Fabious.

(LAUGHS) We shall remember it
for the rest of our lives.

00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:33,908
Isn't that amazing how he can talk

234
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:35,743
and suck my cock at the same exact time?

235
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,746
Yes, it is. Incredible.
(LAUGHING)

Oh, clean yourself up.

237

Should have closed your eyes, Julie.

I know your vulgarity masks your pain.

239

No, it doesn't.

240

I was trying to remember
the last time we had

241
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,628
one of these wonderful
evenings for you, sir.

242
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,992
Surely there must have been one

00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:59,332
somewhere in the history of this
kingdom, of your illustrious life.

of this foul party.

Hey, Simon.

You should swing from your hips,
Brother. You'll get more leverage.

Here, let me show you.

Okay, enough.
I don't want to do swords with you.

You just nicked my knuckles!

281

Oh, you'll be all right. It's not
as if I cut your head off or anything.

Why would you bring
that disgusting thing here?

It's getting juices in our water supply.

284

It's a souvenir of my kill.

I always take one
from a foe that's tasted the cold,

That sounds like a rather stupid,
bloodthirsty tradition.

Why are you such a sourpuss?

I'm not being a sourpuss. I just
didn't wanna be at that celebrations.

to be a part of this moment.

I want you to be gay with me and father.

I'd rather just stay in here

with my blade and fuck things up.

298
00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:07,843

All the while, no one gives
two turtle shits about me.

But Thaddy,
first borns like me, we become king.

305
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:30,768
Second borns, you can be
whatever you want to be.

I want to be king.

307
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,233
Maybe we can both be king.

308
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:38,935
No, I want to be king by myself.

309
00:13:39,148 --> 00:13:41,013
Well, cheer up, Brother.

310
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:42,481
I have something else that you can be.

311
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,576
What?

312
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,314
Best man at my wedding.

313
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:49,847
I can think
of no one else I'd want by my side

314
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:52,920
as I sing my vow passionately
into her eyes.

315
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:55,360
Sounds tedious and boring.

316
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:57,290
If I'm not mistaken, it's tradition

317
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,300
that the best man gets
to finger the bridesmaids.

318
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:03,166
Really? I've never heard
of this tradition.

Who's gonna be
the most handsome best man?

323

Probably me.

Who's the prince
with the most dashing moustache?

325
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:21,014
Me.

326
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:23,387
Who gives the warmest hugs?

327
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:24,823
Me, of course.

328
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:26,984
I love you, Thadeous.

329
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,689
Okay, that's cool.

330
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,999
MALE ANNOUNCER: All gather
for the royal wedding!

331
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:36,662
(ALL CHATTERING)

332
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:51,379
Hello there, best man.

333
00:14:51,854 --> 00:14:52,821
Best man?

334
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:55,822
If he wanted a best man,
he should have chosen me.

335
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:57,949
How many quests
have I been on with Fabious?

336
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,027
- Countless.
- Mmm.

337
00:14:59,862 --> 00:15:03,093
I gave my hand to save his life
on the battlefield.

338
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,065
And yet he chooses Thadeous
as his best man.

339
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:09,793
That sorry sack of shit.

340
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:12,735
Such a poor excuse for a prince.

341
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:16,502
He's nothing more than a self-entitled,
rotten child!

342
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,846
MANIOUS: Idiot.

343
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:21,946
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

344
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:23,118
FABIOUS: Belladonna...

345
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,887
Oh, my love.

346
00:15:28,924 --> 00:15:32,223
Oh, Fabious, I can't wait
until the cervix is over,

347
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:34,386
and to lie together as one:

348
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,192
No, the service.

349
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:41,463
The cervix is a circular wing
of muscles that contracts or expands.

350
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:43,364
It's up in your vagina.

351
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:46,164
That's where my penis will go
after the wedding.

352

(CHUCKLES)

353
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:49,037
Have you not consummated your love?

354
00:15:49,144 --> 00:15:50,133
FABIOUS: Not yet.

355
00:15:50,546 --> 00:15:52,207
Belladonna has never been with a man

356
00:15:52,314 --> 00:15:55,306
so we've decided to preserve her purity
till after the wedding.

357
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:58,813
She's given me this ribbon
from her fair hair.

358
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:02,550
To hold on to until
we can be together in a sex-way.

359
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:04,891
Yes.

360
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:08,354

362
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:11,225
If Thadeous wishes to play forgetful

363
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,800
on his brother's day of days,

364
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,493
then wait we shall not.

365
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,228
I can't get married
without my brother. He's my best man.

366
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:21,501
His time has passed.
Pick another best man.

367
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,634
No.

368
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:25,474
- Julie, you be best man.
- Here you are.

THADEOUS: Oh, Brendan,
you trolls have it so easy.

371
00:16:32,454 --> 00:16:35,821
Out here playing recklessly
in your beautiful mud.

372
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:39,323
Eating your scraps
of horse meats and crumbs.

373
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:41,959
- Green grass.
- Green grass.

374
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:45,092
And do tell, how do you get so dirty?

375
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,298
You just take the earth
and rub it upon your face?

376
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:51,102
Your Highness,

377
00:16:52,508 --> 00:16:55,568
the wedding has... Hello.
The wedding has started.

378
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:57,702
I do not care.

379
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:00,311
I'd rather stay with
this fine gentleman.

380
00:17:00,482 --> 00:17:01,574
Hiding here with my true friends.

381
00:17:01,683 --> 00:17:02,741
Yes.

382
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:06,947
Let the whole entire wedding wonder
and worry where I am.

to intrude on such a joyous occasion.

that you are a man worthy
to bear the family crest,

484
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:45,768
and to show that at your core,
you are not rotten,

but you are brave,
and honorable, and noble.

Either journey with your brother
and the Knights Elite,

489

or you can face banishment
from the kingdom.

490
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:01,647
Shit.

(SIMON SCREECHING)

493
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:28,980
You see, Courtney,

494
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:32,213
I alone understand how
to properly prepare for a quest.

495
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:36,457
Masculine garments,
proper, good collie to smoke upon.

496
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:38,320
How is Steven doing?

497
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:40,324
He looks like he's stoned, sir.

498
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:41,791
Fabious has Simon,

499
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:45,424
and now I have Steven,
a far superior creature companion.

500
00:23:45,534 --> 00:23:46,796
Wouldn't you agree?

501
00:23:47,002 --> 00:23:49,664
He will fare very well, indeed,
I'm sure, Your Highness.

502
00:23:49,772 --> 00:23:52,570
I do hope this adventure
is not too stressful or boring.

503
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:57,008
Either way I intend to get properly
fucked up if no one disagrees.

504
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:16,896
Belladonna, wake up. Wake up.

505
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:19,090
Who is that? Where am I?

506
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:21,066
'Tis I, Fabious. Your love.

(GASPS)

508
00:24:22,772 --> 00:24:23,739
Fabious?

509
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:25,668
You're still in Leezar's lair.

510
00:24:25,775 --> 00:24:28,471
But fear not, I'm here to rescue you.

511
00:24:28,577 --> 00:24:30,442
Fabious, it's really you.

512
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:32,571
I knew you'd come to find me.

513

(LAUGHING RAUCOUSLY)

514
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:42,688
I can't do this. I can't do it.
It's so mean.

515
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:47,526
You should've seen
the look on your face. It's me!

516
00:24:48,297 --> 00:24:49,821
You're still a prisoner.

517
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,694
I've seen a beautiful world
beyond this prison,

518
00:24:52,802 --> 00:24:54,997
and I count the hours till I escape.

519
00:24:55,304 --> 00:24:57,169
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

520
00:24:57,273 --> 00:25:01,403
Lookie there.
The twin moons drawing slowly together.

521
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,178
Time moving them closer.

522
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,214
Just as time moves you
and I closer together.

523
00:25:08,551 --> 00:25:11,714
And when
the two moons unite, so shall we.

524
00:25:12,121 --> 00:25:15,613
Perhaps, keeping you
in this tower has left you ignorant.

525
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:18,158
You're so easily deceived.

526
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:22,419
For example, I have heard
that your Prince Fabious

527
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:25,691
has made his bed recklessly
with many maidens.

528
00:25:27,837 --> 00:25:32,501
And I heard that he has fungi
on his genitalia as a result.

529
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:35,107
Also, he organizes orgies

530
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:38,174
with wenches and barbarians alike

531
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,683
and he takes sperm on him
and gives it to women freely.

532
00:25:43,118 --> 00:25:45,052
Spilling his seed willy-nilly

533
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:48,417
as he makes his way through that orgy.

534
00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:50,682
I don't believe you.

535
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:54,694
He is not the dashing young man
you believe him to be.

536
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,997
So

537
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:01,735
these are the harsh realities
of the outside world.

538
00:26:03,706 --> 00:26:05,333
Welcome home.

539
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,508

00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,050
Oh.

00:26:15,217 --> 00:26:17,242
Sorry to disturb you two love birds

542
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:20,217
but we've arrived
at the home of the Wize Wizard.

543
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:21,855
Who the hell is the Wize Wizard?

544
00:26:22,157 --> 00:26:23,954
He's an ancient seer who helps many

545
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:25,822
on their quest with added insight.

546
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:28,897
Great. Well, let me know how it goes.

547
00:26:29,098 --> 00:26:31,032
Leave him in his carriage, Fabious.

548
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,363
You and I will seek counsel
with the Wize Wizard.

549
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:34,493
No.

Come, Brother. This is the first stop
on your first quest.

Brother,

555
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:55,181
you look ravishing in that armor,

00:26:55,291 --> 00:26:57,452
but I don't think you'll need it.

The Wize Wizard is a peaceful,
little old man.

I'm wearing it.
You're just being jealous.

cultivating glorious herbs in here.

is that you over there?

(WIZE WIZARD CHUCKLES)

587
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,237

are you seeing what I'm seeing?

In five nights' time,

to do this warlock in.

What journey be long and twisted
and sensitive at hand?

00:30:56,313 --> 00:31:00,977
You want us to twist what is long
with our sensitive hands.

Face me, you traitor.

(GROANING)

822
00:39:20,865 --> 00:39:21,889
Look!

823
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:23,091
COURTNEY: Oh, shit!

824
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:24,259
(BOTH SHOUTING)

825
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:39,341
(MANIOUS AND THUNDARIAN SCREAMING)

826
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:41,946
We did it!

827
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:43,950
(GRUNTS)

828
00:39:45,823 --> 00:39:47,051
FABIOUS: Ka-boom!

829
00:39:47,258 --> 00:39:48,657
COURTNEY: (LAUGHING) Yes!

830
00:39:51,763 --> 00:39:53,560
LEEZAR: If I could have
everyone's attention.

831
00:39:54,165 --> 00:39:56,656
I'd like to say a few words, if I may.

832
00:39:56,868 --> 00:39:59,166
I have prepared this feast

833
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:02,237
in honor and appreciation of Belladonna.

834
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,670
Seems like it was only yesterday

835
00:40:04,776 --> 00:40:08,212
that we used sorcery
to burn your village to the ground,

836
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,042
come in and snatch you.

837
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:11,641
But I remember looking at you

838
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:13,148
all those years ago and thinking,

839
00:40:13,551 --> 00:40:16,019
"Wow, that's a baby."

840
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,155
"And that's the baby that someday
I will have to have sex with."

841
00:40:19,357 --> 00:40:20,847
Now, look at me.

842
00:40:21,058 --> 00:40:23,117
A 19-year-old boy, almost a man,

843
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:24,251
(LAUGHS)

844
00:40:24,362 --> 00:40:25,852
still a virgin.

845
00:40:26,063 --> 00:40:27,155
To the fuckening!

846
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:29,730
- Yes, to the fuckening!
- (SPITS IN DISGUST)

847
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:33,194
Leezar, what is this rubbish
you have set before us?

848
00:40:33,404 --> 00:40:36,032
It's such a funny choice for a feast.

849
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,798
I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.

850
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:40,207
Dealing with her and you
and the fucking prophecy.

851
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:41,605
I mean, we could all just relax...

852
00:40:41,712 --> 00:40:42,872
JULIE: Master.

853
00:40:43,014 --> 00:40:44,675
What do you want, Julie?

854
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:47,213
Regrettably, the Princes of Mourne
have escaped.

855
00:40:47,418 --> 00:40:49,750
You should've killed them
at the wedding when you had the chance.

856
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:51,488
Fabious is of no purpose to us.

857
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:52,681
Silence!

858
00:40:52,824 --> 00:40:55,759
His purpose is to destroy you
and your evil ways.

859
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:58,157
Would you shut up,
or I will love you less.

860
00:40:58,262 --> 00:41:00,127
Are those fish fingers you're eating?

861
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:02,993
No more questions! Now find them!

862
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,117
(URGING HORSES)

863
00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:09,186
Shit! Fabious, the horses!
They're escaping.

864
00:41:09,287 --> 00:41:12,688
Yes, it's a distraction
to lead them off our trail.

865
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:14,950
And what are we to do now?
Walk all the way home?

866
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,628
Home? We're not going home.

867
00:41:17,762 --> 00:41:18,751
Just because the knights betrayed us

868
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:20,854
does not mean we give up
on the quest.

869
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:23,125
Together we can still accomplish
what needs to be done.

870
00:41:23,335 --> 00:41:25,326
How? We're lost, I'm hungry.

871
00:41:25,437 --> 00:41:27,667
This stump, it's putting
my asshole to sleep.

872
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:30,434
Thadeous, your feet are bare.
Put your boots on.

873
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:32,968
They're filthy,
I'm having them exfoliated.

874
00:41:33,078 --> 00:41:34,602
No time for exfoliation.

875
00:41:36,648 --> 00:41:38,138
The compass points north.

876
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,942
We shall follow it still.

877
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,513
I will not give up till Belladonna
is safe in mine arms.

878
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,587
- Oh, god.
- (SIMON SQUAWKING)

879
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,241
Simon! Where have you been?

880
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:50,638
Shit.

881
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:51,871
What?

882
00:41:52,046 --> 00:41:54,514
I left goddamn Steven back at camp.

883
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:55,909
Who's Steven?

884
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:58,017
He's my loyal animal companion.

885
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:01,518
And he means just as much to me
as Simon means to you.

886
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:04,190
But I guess I'll never see him again.

887
00:42:04,392 --> 00:42:06,826
Very well. I understand that bond.

888
00:42:07,095 --> 00:42:11,122
Let us return to camp,
face the traitors and rescue Steven.

889
00:42:11,299 --> 00:42:12,994
No, fuck it. It's over.

890
00:42:13,267 --> 00:42:16,065
But, perhaps, since my animal companion
is no longer here,

891
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,502
it's only fair that we get rid
of yours as well.

892
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:19,573
(CHIRPS SADLY)

893
00:42:20,508 --> 00:42:22,738
No, that would serve
no purpose, Brother.

894
00:42:22,944 --> 00:42:24,878
That would be like
me asking you to get rid of Courtney

895
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:26,708
just because Julie is no longer with us.

896
00:42:26,948 --> 00:42:29,109
I will drown Courtney
in the shallow fucking pond right now

897
00:42:29,217 --> 00:42:30,343
if that means fair is fair.

898
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:31,918
I don't like that idea, sir.

899
00:42:32,019 --> 00:42:33,953
No, Simon can help us.

900
00:42:34,055 --> 00:42:35,022
Simon,

901
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,721
you must take this message to father.

902
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:40,350
Tell him that
the Knights Elite betrayed us

903
00:42:40,461 --> 00:42:43,897
and he must send an army
across the valley to Muldiss Darton

904
00:42:44,098 --> 00:42:46,396
and help us retrieve
the Blade of Unicorn.

905
00:42:46,534 --> 00:42:47,626
Hurry, Simon!

906
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:50,795
Fly to Mourne
and deliver these desperate words.

907
00:42:51,072 --> 00:42:52,369
Fly!

908
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:54,006
Fly!

909
00:42:58,179 --> 00:42:59,168
(SNIFFING)

910
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,215
Come on, Manious,
you've been sniffing dirt all morning.

911
00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:05,080
We would not be in this position, Julie,

912
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:07,984
if you wouldn't have gotten caught
communicating with Leezar.

913
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:10,249
And if you ladies were proper assassins,

914
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:13,725
you'd have cut them down back there
as the Dark Lord commanded.

915
00:43:15,229 --> 00:43:16,924
Manious, what do you see?

916
00:43:17,198 --> 00:43:19,826
They stepped towards the sun here.

917
00:43:20,034 --> 00:43:23,265
This blade of grass,
one of them pissed on it.

918
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:27,631
And then they moved, very quickly,
mind, towards...

919
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:29,398
There!

920
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:32,778
JULIE: That's Marteetee's land.

921
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,947
What?

922
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:36,844
JULIE: Our mission may
be completed sooner than I expected.

923
00:43:37,285 --> 00:43:38,411
(LAUGHS)

924
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:42,783
If I may be so bold, Your Highness,

925
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,654
what is the meaning
of that ribbon that you hold?

926
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,484
This?

927
00:43:47,695 --> 00:43:49,526
It's a gift from Belladonna.

928
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,619
A symbol of her virgin purity.

929
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:54,514
I hold it and savor it.

930
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:57,745
You do that instead
of have sex with her?

931
00:43:57,955 --> 00:44:00,116
Belladonna is unlike any maiden
in the kingdom.

932
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:02,054
She behaves without judgment,

933
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,683
defies expectation.

934
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:05,653
When I first heard her voice

935
00:44:05,763 --> 00:44:07,628
a tear came to my eye,

936
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:09,392
and that tear turned to ice,

937
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,468
and I kept that frozen tear

938
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:14,036
far from my heart
that burns with passion.

939
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:16,495
If she had a wound,

940
00:44:16,707 --> 00:44:18,675
I would kiss it.

941
00:44:18,776 --> 00:44:21,040
If she had a splinter,

942
00:44:21,145 --> 00:44:24,637
I would pull it
from her flesh with mine lips.

943
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:29,979
Just say we are too late
and Leezar has had his way with her,

944
00:44:30,287 --> 00:44:33,848
would you still be able to be with her?

945
00:44:35,025 --> 00:44:36,515
I don't want to think about that.

946
00:44:36,727 --> 00:44:38,627
But just say that we were moments late,

947
00:44:38,729 --> 00:44:42,165
and he was able to get her cookies.

948
00:44:42,466 --> 00:44:43,524
Shut up.

949
00:44:43,634 --> 00:44:47,570
Yes, I know, but what if he butt-fucked
her? Would you still like her?

950
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:49,161
Do I have to write you a poem?

951
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,908
There's never been
a love so true as ours.

952
00:44:53,077 --> 00:44:54,510
That's pure love.

953
00:44:54,745 --> 00:44:56,042
Yes, it is.

954
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,613
THADEOUS: No, that's pure love.

955
00:44:57,915 --> 00:44:59,906
There's a naked woman
standing behind you.

956
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:03,711
Who is that?

957
00:45:04,054 --> 00:45:05,919
Is she looking at us?

958
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,751
Who is it? Is it him?
Are you looking to him?

959
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:09,925
Is it Courtney? Is it to me?

960
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,388
It's Courtney. I think it's to me.

961
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:15,427
COURTNEY: I believe she is
taking her trousers off.

962
00:45:15,732 --> 00:45:18,758
Right, I will return momentarily.

963
00:45:18,869 --> 00:45:19,995
COURTNEY: No.

964
00:45:20,104 --> 00:45:21,264
Thadeous, it might be a trap.

965
00:45:21,939 --> 00:45:26,035
The only thing those tits will trap
is my warm spray.

966
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,269
Have fun rubbing your ribbon.

967
00:45:28,846 --> 00:45:29,938
Disgusting.

968
00:45:30,047 --> 00:45:31,014
- Come back here, you.
- (GIGGLING)

969
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:37,032
I'm beginning to think he doesn't care
about this quest.

970
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:39,398
What could possibly
make you think that, sir?

971
00:45:39,506 --> 00:45:40,473
THADEOUS: Oh, shit!

972
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,970
Oh, shit! It's a trap. A booby trap.

973
00:45:43,176 --> 00:45:44,143
Oh, god!

974
00:45:44,344 --> 00:45:45,777
It was a trap. (EXCLAIMS)

975
00:45:45,979 --> 00:45:47,446
White people, I knew it!

976
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,636
COURTNEY: White people?

977
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:50,476
- Are they nice or are they mean?
- FABIOUS: They're mean!

978
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:51,845
They're the meanest!

979
00:45:52,218 --> 00:45:53,242
