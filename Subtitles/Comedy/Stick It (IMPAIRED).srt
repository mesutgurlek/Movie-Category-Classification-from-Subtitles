00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,102
You don't have to like me
or like it here.

160
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,297
But you do have to respect it.

161
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,397
[grunting]

162
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,939
Respect? [laughing]
Is this how you respect people?

163
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,880
You throw 'em over a shoulder
and violate their personal space?

164
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,474
Oh, goody.

165
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,043
I heard you were like this.
I'm so glad it's true.

166
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,521
What is it that you've
done to earn my respect?

167
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,491
We have rules.
We have rules for training.

168
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,549
Oh.

169
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,926
And the reason
that we have rules...

170
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:21,455
...and coaches is because
this is gymnastics.

171
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,297
Hey!

172
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,570
That was rude. [sighs]

173
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,166
While danger and risk is the reality
of what we do, it's calculated.

174
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,507
Can't be calculated
if you don't respect the laws.

175
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,479
[sighing]

176
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,948
Uh-huh.

177
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,610
[shouting]

178
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:42,483
The laws of gravity,
for instance.

179
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,423
OK, what's your point?

180
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,018
Look, I want you
to be back here tomorrow

181
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,925
at 10am, ready to train.

182
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,989
Or we can call the judge,
and you can go to jail.

183
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,032
Hey, you decide.

184
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,233
[Haley] Don't expect me to train.

185
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,004
- And lose the hat tomorrow.
- [Haley] Lose the gum.

186
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,377
Good morning, ladies.

187
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,243
How's your neck?
Feeling better?

188
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,080
- It feels much better.
- Good, good.

189
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,017
Now, remember, stretch. Yeah?

190
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,588
'Morning, Haley.

191
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,681
- Hey.
- Be with you in a minute.

192
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,327
Now... Well, you know
about your daughter.

193
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,830
Your daughter is
the best one, I've gotta say.

194
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,367
I've never seen
anything quite like her.

195
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,165
We'd like to fast-track her
towards becoming an elite.

196
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,401
- That's 20 hours a week.
- Well, she's a star.

197
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,533
- [woman] She's six.
- Oh...

198
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,205
I've got two other kids.
That is a big commitment.

199
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,046
We'd have her nationally ranked
by the time she's ten.

200
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:48,018
Olympic track by age 13.
That's the gold.

201
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,285
- You mean the goal.
- Did I say gold? [laughs]

202
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,017
Well, you see?

203
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:59,462
I guess Madison and gold
are becoming synonymous for me.

204
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,632
- [woman] I'll have the check Tuesday.
- Wonderful.

205
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,695
[Haley] Uh, yeah.

206
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,139
You got a lot of people
going to the Olympics.

207
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,635
Just wondering, um, what country
are they gonna represent?

208
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,873
State of Delusion?

209
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,468
- [woman] Good, job, girls.
- I'm so hot. It's so hot outside.

210
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:40,403
Vick! When can we scrap
the old long-sleeve leotards?

211
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,633
We need new ones
for championships.

212
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,142
Every college will be scouting me.

213
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,700
[scoffing]

214
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,646
Not that you have
to worry about any of that.

215
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,041
New leotard might distract,
you know, the judges and scouts

216
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,952
from your lack of talent.
It's a solid strategy.

217
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:00,924
Gee, Pariah Carey, I wonder
why no one's scouting you.

218
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,122
Oh, I forgot, you don't matter.

219
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,536
That she can even say
the word "college"

220
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,798
is an indictment
against the institution.

221
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,000
Hey, Filibuster, no one cares.

222
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,874
Wei Wei. Those moves are
throwing off your routines.

223
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,810
Sorry.

224
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,815
Chalk.
Storage closet. Now.

225
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:27,010
[sighs]

226
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,021
[woman with accent]
Pretty feet, pretty feet.

227
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,650
Point them hard
and win the meet.

228
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,954
Very good. Yes.

229
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,086
[girl] Dorrie, did you
see the last one?

230
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:42,657
- [clapping]
- Wow.

231
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,533
Déjà-jealous, Haley?
Bring back memories?

232
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,936
We trained together
at Defrank's for how long?

233
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,373
That would be, uh... too long.

234
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:54,503
And he'd give you so much
attention because you sucked.

235
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,780
Right.

236
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,181
Yeah, I sucked my way to Worlds.

237
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,210
Glad to see you haven't lost
your love of accuracy, Joanne.

238
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:07,384
Well, at least I didn't make it
all the way to Worlds and...

239
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,950
...um, choke.

240
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,964
[chuckling] Here, let me show you how,

241
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,897
- you little...
- [screaming]

242
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,162
[woman] Hey!
Stop right now! Stop it!

243
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:22,003
I said, pointy feet,
not pointy words.

244
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,975
Pointy words
are mouth turds. God!

245
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,979
- [woman muttering]
- I'm OK. She's crazy.

246
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,413
I'm so jealous of Joanne
that I've actually

247
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,916
already memorized
her preschool beam routine.

248
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,852
Hey, easy.
I choreographed that routine.

249
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,981
[mimicking accent]
Your secret is safe with me.

250
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,791
[humming]

251
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,092
We got some finger-flickin'
good choreography.

252
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,565
And the classic butt shelf.

253
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,432
[pretends to fart]
Joanne, how embarrassing.

254
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,165
Then we have some
useless bits of fluff

255
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,208
to get us from
point A to point B.

256
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,837
And induces the urge to vacuum.

257
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,541
[whirring]

258
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,512
- Mina, right?
- Yeah, Mina.

259
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,417
Mina, put down the phone.

260
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,889
[Haley] Can you tell Joanne I'm gonna
take over and do a real dismount?

261
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:16,223
Joanne, Haley's on the phone.
She's gonna do a real dismount.

262
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,195
I heard her, thank you.

263
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,754
How 'bout a double back?

264
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,734
You will not throw a double back
without training it first.

265
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,202
- [Haley] Close your eyes.
- Over my dead body.

266
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,933
- Little CPR might do you good.
- [Vick] Haley!

267
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,978
- [gasping]
- [chuckling]

268
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,379
[Haley] Ahh...

269
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,283
Shall we share our philosophy
with Haley, ladies?

270
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:45,153
Speak my mind.
What are we about?

271
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,990
[all] Clean, safe routines,
guaranteed to stick.

272
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,222
[retching]

273
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,697
Is he keeping
your brains in jars?

274
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,064
Or should I be concerned
about the water?

275
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,969
[Vick] Shall we show Haley
what discipline is all about?

276
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,801
Please join us, Haley.

277
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:06,072
Ehh. No, thanks.
I'm kinda tired.

278
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,673
Oh, all right. Fine.
Ladies, outside, now!

279
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,412
Point your toes, ladies.

280
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,580
You're gonna keep going
until Haley participates.

281
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,492
This is, like, globally unfair.

282
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:27,999
- We're gonna be here all night.
- Lift your knees... Joanne.

283
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:31,297
[Joanne] This is totally
violating the penile code.

284
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,531
[rattling]

285
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,604
Hey!

286
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,044
Hey! You guys.

287
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,482
What, do you want me
to pick the lock, or what?

288
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,816
Can you come let me in?

289
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,617
Oh, right. Thank you.

290
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,124
- [girl] Get lost!
- [sighing]

291
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,761
[car approaching]

292
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,410
Haley, let's go for a drive.

293
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,846
...deserve to be.
- A what?

294
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,939
Thank you, Lorelei,
that was delicious.

295
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,644
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna finish this off...

296
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,277
- No, no.
...if that's OK.

297
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,219
- Thank you.
- Are you serious?

298
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,984
I heard you were
strict about diet,

299
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,821
but this is just rude.

300
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,487
Hey, you piss where I eat,
you don't eat.

301
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,961
Oh, but you do?

302
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,964
Does this mean
you're eating my piss?

303
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,023
Well, that's disgusting.

304
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,160
[sighing]

305
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,672
What a charming
young lady you are.

306
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,469
Yeah, that's what they say.

307
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,476
[exhaling deeply]

308
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,513
Listen, I don't suppose,
uh, college gymnastics

309
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,172
is on your to-do list, right?

310
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,377
Correct. College gymnastics
is one big fat to-don't.

311
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,420
Great. Then in
addition to sparing

312
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,285
innocent collegiate
gymnastics coaches everywhere,

313
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,383
you can keep any purse money
that you might win, free and clear.

314
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,258
I'm not competing
or training again. Ever.

the judge and kiss 18 goodbye?

- Hey.
- What the?

318
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,799
The IG Classic is
comin' up in a month.

319
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,537
Now, you apply yourself,

320
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,636
you could win
some restitution money.

321

It could get ya outta here.
What do you think?

322
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,280
I think if you showed up
at the Classic with me

Hey, none taken.

and losing a tenth 'cause
her toes weren't pointed.

331
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,306
Nothin' fair about judges
who don't have instant replay,

332
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,205
and they're lookin'
for perfection.

333
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,744

without instant replay?

- It'd be mayhem.

Yeah. It makes conventionality
good and innovation bad.

She wants you to do

your hardest tricks because
she knows you'll mess up.

She's trying to

Hi, honey.
I miss you, sweetheart.

I missed you so much.
Hey, you're doin' a great job.

I need to talk about
comin' back with Chris.

You owe Chris some respect.

Yeah. Actually, I do.

The only thing Burt Vickerman
respects is money.

He cares about
cash and cashing in.

hadn't paid him off,

What do you mean, "paid him off"?
Everybody there pays.

Nobody wanted you.

Don't bail again. Finish the meet.
Finish it for yourself!

about the fact that this was about me.

You know, helping me.
My freedom.

You forgot to tell me about the
part you were cashing in on it.

I never lied to you.

Everything you said was insurance
to get those fat checks from my father.

Haley, you're not leaving like this.

You're gonna go back in there.
Finish this meet.

Don't make this another Worlds.

- No.
- Don't bail.

You don't know
the first thing about Worlds.

Fine, I give up.
You know, we gave it a shot.

Maybe you should go back to Defrank's.

- Well, you don't listen to me.

00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,568
Clearly you listened
to him long enough to...

866
00:56:56,646 --> 00:56:59,638
Yeah, long enough to
hook up with my mom.

- [whimpers]
- Hmm?

00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:15,393
...rip my family apart.

875
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,210
I had no idea.

876
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,950
- I'm sorry.
- You know what?

877
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:47,496
You didn't owe it to me
to be a decent coach.

ask you something?

And I'm being
completely serious.

Why do girls wear so much
glitter and clippage in their hair?

887

I mean, that is some
uptight friggin' hair. Right?

00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,422
How do leotards not
ride up their butts?

00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,218
- Yeah, good one.
- Tuf-Skin.

890
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,452
Aww.
They have ass calluses?

891
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,461
[laughing] No. Uh...

892
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,963
It's just this sticky stuff
you spray on your butt

893
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,555
so the leotard doesn't ride up.

894
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,431
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can I get that job? I wanna be Tuf-Skin.

895
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:00,833
- Shut up.
- Hey.

896
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:02,269
What would happen if you put

897
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,670
some of that Tuf-Skin
stuff on tough skin?

898
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,641
Your head would stick to your butt.

899
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,643
Why would my head stick to my butt?

900
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,646
'Cause your head's
already up there! Ah!

901

Don't worry, Frank...

902
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,982
...my head's up my butt too.

903

Far.

904
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,295
Oh. Have a seat, Haley.

905
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:34,998
I'd like you to read something
for me, please, out loud.

906
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,834
Second paragraph.

907
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,639
Uh..."The gymnastics world,
like the real world,

908
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,736
can be a very unforgiving place.

909
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:47,476
As I know all too well, there might be
too much chalk on the blackboard

910
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,986
for her to get a clean slate,
competing with me or anyone else.

911
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:54,717
And Haley has earned
the right to a clean slate.

912
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,453
She's quite capable of
deciding what's best for her.

913
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,087
And I encourage the court
to include her perspective

914
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:03,257
in its decision.
Sincerely, Burt Vickerman."

That's all, Haley.
You're free to go.

917
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,870
What about the restitution?

918
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,240
Oh, that's been taken care of.

919
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,302
Be good.

920
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,177
Sounds like you're built for it.

Thank you.

You know, Haley,

923
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:32,353
there are a lot
of great people

924
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:35,420
who had jerks for parents.

925

01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,959
Stay tight in the air.

937
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:14,060
Oh, nice! Nice. Nice.

[sighing]

939
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,506
You got through an entire letter
without using the word "gold."

940
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,513
- It was tough.
- [laughing]

941
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,674
And the restitution.
I mean, was that?

942
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,947
Dev?
Give us a sec, would ya?

943

[clearing throat]

944
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:37,388
Look, don't... uh,
don't read anything into it.

945
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,121
- You didn't have to do that.
- I...

946
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,925
I paid with your father's money.

947
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:47,165
You know what? I, uh...

948
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:51,229
[clears throat]
I completely misjudged you.

949
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,439
[sighs] Hmm.

950
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,809
I've decided I'm gonna
take you to Championships.

951
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,877
You know, show you
how to really do it.

952
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:07,923
Come on,
you're high on chalk.

[laughing]

954
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,259
Who even said you could stay?
I didn't say you could stay.

955
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,386
- Haley!
- Hey, Mina.

956
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,021
- Hey.
- Hey, Wei Wei.

957
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:16,258
- We're so sorry.
- Yeah.

958
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,027
Joanne kind of misrepresented...

959
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:20,569
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry, I understand.

960
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,604
Listen, I'll stay
on one condition.

961
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:23,969
Oh, this I gotta hear.

962
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,702
Does it involve you
and self-imposed silence?

963
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:28,004
Get back on the tramp.

964
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,602
[Haley] You girls
wanna see Vick do a layout?

965
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,875
He's so, like, old, though.

966
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,917
- Hey.
- [Mina] Uh, he might break a hip.

967
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:38,920
No. He'll be fine.
Come on.

968
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:42,185
I'll go to Championships if
you get on the tramp right now,

969
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,748
and you do a layout.

970
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:46,090
- It's your call.
- Don't do it, Vick.

971
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:49,757
- This is a really bad idea.
- Come on, Vick.

972
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:52,801
[girls] Vick!
Vick! Vick! Vick!

973

If you get on this tramp,
you will have a cardiovasectomy.

974
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:58,465
I will have
a cardiovasectomy.

975
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,566
Come on, Vick!
Come on! Come on, Vick!

976
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,305
- [Wei Wei] You can do it!
- [Joanna] Peer pressure.

No, we aren't.

We have workouts to finish.

Who died and made you Nadia?

1002
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,311
[Wei Wei] You know you wanna go.

1003
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:22,585
We can't just leave.
Championships are three weeks away.

1004
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,353
Our routines need to be perfect.

1005
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:27,624
Put some clothes on and get
in the truck. We're goin' out.

01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:28,686
[shouting]

Can you speak?

1010
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:39,169
[Frank] Can you do anything
besides gymnastics?

[laughing]

1012
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,639
OK. Anything to
get out of this 'tard.

1013
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,343
That's "leotard"
without the "leo."

1014
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,009
In case
you were wondering.

1015
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,252
Dude, she's hot.

1016
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:57,792
What? You don't think
she's hot? I think she's hot.

1017
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,384
Dude, she has an apple butt.

1018
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,692

- An apple butt.

OK, now my turn.

1022
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,463
So is Frank your, like,
boyfriend or something?

1023

Like, no.

1024

- No.

- Why not?
- Ew!

So they're, like, fair game?

- Ye...
- Hey, stupid.

I prefer the term
"meat," please.

[chuckling] That was spastic.

1030
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:27,712
Thank you.

01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,088
May I accompany you

We also have that style

1040
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,248
Huh. So, uh, why
are you buying a dress?

1041
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,344
Because you're
taking me to your prom.

1042
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:35,185
Well, shouldn't you
be buying a tux? Just kidding.

1043

We can both wear dresses.

getting me a corsage.

I don't like how you act.

um, it would be my honor.

No.

But I don't have the problem
with it that Frank does.

know you anymore.

01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,541
The Olympics are ages away.

1091
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,342
Prom is, like, any minute.

1092
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:40,905
- OK.
- Phyllis.

1093
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,247
You are a 24-hour gymnast.

1094
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,150
Not part-time.
Full-time.

1095
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,313
I know.

1096
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:49,824
- Phyllis.
- And... we have an agreement

1097
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:51,359
that you agreed to honor.

1098
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:55,261
You are not going to the prom.
End of discussion.

1099
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,696
- OK.
- [Vick] May I?

1100
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:01,594
Phyllis, now Joanne
is a lovely gymnast.

1101
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,002
I think we oughta get real
about her chances

1102
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,472
of making the Olympic team.

1103
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:14,315
The only reason we're here
is because we agreed

1104
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:18,012
that she'd be going
to the Olympics.

1105
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,454
I know. I know.

1106
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:23,151
[Vick] I, uh...

1107
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,824
I guess I lied. Hmm?

1108
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,431
Look, everyone...

1109
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:37,529
Everyone wants to hear
that their kid is special.

1110
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,540
And they are.

1111
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:43,169
And maybe they're
going to the Olympics.

1112
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,008
- "Maybe."
- Yes. Maybe they will.

1113
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,742
[Phyllis] We don't pay for "maybe."

1114
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:51,252
People told me I was nuts
to bring Joanne here.

1115
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,255
And they were right.

1116
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:58,623
I'm just glad that I'm
getting her out of here in one piece.

1117
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:01,993
A coach who's a has-been

1118
01:10:02,064 --> 01:10:05,329
doesn't coach champions.

1119
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,131
He just makes more has-beens.

1120
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:09,929
Goodbye, Burt.

1121
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,031
You will miss me.

1122
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,910
Championships are three weeks away.

1123
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,448
- Where we gonna go?
- I'll coach you myself.

1124
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,281
I thought you
wanted her to win.

1125
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:27,047
And what would you know
about winning?

1126
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:33,221
Joanne. You're more
than welcome to stay.

1127
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,785
[sighing]

1128
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,854
Josie, let's go.

1129
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,774
I think I'm gonna
go to prom first.

1130
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:52,271
[rock music]

1131
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,277
[woman directing gymnasts]

1132
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,795
Are you OK?

1133
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:11,526
Oh, it's just... I haven't
had four girls qualify

1134
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,693
for Championships
in a long time.

1135
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:16,031
Define "long."

1136
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:20,769
[sighing] Actually, I haven't
had four girls qualify...

1137
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,834
...ever.

1138
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:26,242
Are you gonna cry?

1139
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:28,850
No, I'm not gonna cry.

1140
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,179
It's just...

1141
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:33,483
[stuttering] It's a nice thing.
It's beautiful.

1142
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:36,956
- Jesus, Hay.
- What? You can cry.

1143
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,119
Doesn't make you
any less of a man, Vicki.

1144
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,923
Come on,
I won't tell the parents.

1145
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:42,987
[techno music]

1146
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:51,300
[man] Welcome to the Neutrogena
National Gymnastics Championships.

1147
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:53,466
Hello, everybody.
I'm Tim Dagget,

1148
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:55,533
joined along
with Elfi Schlegel.

1149
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:59,069
It is two days of gymnastics
competition on tap.

1150
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,843
Today, the all-around finals.

1151
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,908
Day two, the individual event finals.

1152
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,648
Think of the difference
as a jack-of-all-trades

1153
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:09,452
versus an individual-event specialist.

1154
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,390
She should do her routine
then warm up.

1155
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,587
- They stretched.
- They need to warm up.

1156
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,254
- No.
- They've been stretching.

1157
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,822
[sighing] Oh, crap.

1158
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,961
Hm, Vickerman. Must be
some crutches around somewhere.

1159
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:23,971
Tonight, the all-around competition,

1160
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:27,167
where the top six qualify
for a berth on the World Team.

1161
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:29,472
The longtime favorite,
Tricia Skilken,

1162
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,036
is hoping to make her
fifth and final World Team

1163
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,275
before her retirement.

1164
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,080
While gymnastics wild child,
Haley Graham, has come out

1165
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,677
of retirement to try to
make it for the second time.

1166
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:42,849
Will her pyrotechnics
rise to the occasion?

1167
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:44,950
Or will she simply flame out?

1168
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,222
Few can forget
Haley Graham's walkout

1169
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,526
of the World Championships
two years ago.

1170
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:51,657
Haley was last to go
on the floor exercise

1171
01:12:51,734 --> 01:12:54,828
when she shocked fans
and teammates by exiting the arena

1172
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,872
and walking into an
automatic disqualification.

1173
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,874
That stroll knocked Team USA

1174
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:03,378
completely out of medal position.
If ever there was a score to settle,

1175
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:05,811
it's between Tricia Skilken
and Haley Graham.

1176
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,314
Tricia.

1177
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,309
I didn't mean
to wreck your Worlds.

1178
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,412
Mine was disintegrating and...

1179
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,219
I wrote you a note, apologizing.

1180
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,987
I don't know
if you got it or not.

1181
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:24,755
[Tim] We have a tremendous amount
of talented athletes out on the floor.

1182
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:28,997
One of them, Haley Graham, brings
a lot of potential to this US team.

1183
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:32,563
She could medal internationally
on virtually all of the apparatus.

1184
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,109
Super power, huge difficulty,

1185
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:37,668
but she is not known
for her consistency.

1186
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,772
And, Elfi, when you get right
down to it, in gymnastics,

1187
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,682
consistency over flash
is what rules the day.

1188
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,414
[Elfi] And, Tim, we have
to remember that for Haley,

1189
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:49,150
it's her record
and her reputation that will

1190
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,556
really be the only thing
stopping them

1191
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:54,653
from handing her that valuable
one-way ticket to Rome

1192
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:57,392
and the World Championships,
later on this year.

1193
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,162
<i>[Haley] It's the</i>
<i>same old Championships,</i>

1194
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,399
<i>but I am a totally</i>
<i>different person.</i>

1195
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,704
<i>And even though I'm pretty</i>
<i>sure that I'll be judged</i>

1196
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,747
<i>for who I was</i>
<i>and not who I am,</i>

1197
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,180
<i>I know I have to face this.</i>

1198
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,423
<i>Four events and</i>
<i>four judges per event.</i>

1199
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:25,983
<i>That's 16 judges ready to</i>
<i>tell us just how badly we suck.</i>

1200
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:30,088
<i>Sixteen people ready to tell us</i>
<i>just how perfect we're not.</i>

1201
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:33,828
<i>But here we are...</i>
<i>chasing perfection.</i>

1202
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:38,569
<i>The problem is,</i>
<i>perfection doesn't exist.</i>

1203
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,636
<i>But just try telling that</i>
<i>to the judges.</i>

1204
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:45,373
[audience claps and cheers]

1205
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,218
Where'd ya find deductions?

1206
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,448
- The floor? Trash?
- 'Scuse me? Can you move?

1207
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:58,482
Very clever. No, we decided her start
value is a nine-point-eight, not a ten.

1208
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,394
You know the strength required for that?
You realize what you're doin' to her?

1209
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,625
- I'm quite aware.
- This about her routine?

1210
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,565
We don't want to encourage the girls

1211
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:09,195
to attempt such a
dangerous skill and risk injury.

1212
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,069
Surely, you know,
with your track record,

1213
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,973
you could understand that.
I mean, probably, anyway.

1214
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:17,637
- I understand. Believe me.
- Could you move, please?

1215
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:23,149
<i>[Haley] Doesn't matter how</i>
<i>hard we run or how high we flip.</i>

1216
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:26,654
<i>Leave your hands</i>
<i>on the vault table too long, deduction.</i>

1217
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:29,316
<i>If you use one arm instead</i>
<i>of two, big deduction.</i>

1218
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:30,881
<i>And if your feet</i>
<i>clip the vault</i>

1219
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:34,156
<i>before they hit the floor...</i>
<i>you're done.</i>

1220
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:36,629
<i>So you say you want lyrics</i>
<i>in your floor music?</i>

1221
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,893
<i>[chuckling] Huge deduction.</i>

1222
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:40,525
<i>Music finishes,</i>
<i>but you don't?</i>

1223
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:41,933
<i>Two-tenths deduction.</i>

1224
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,137
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>how well you do.</i>

1225
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,403
<i>It's how well</i>
<i>you follow their rules.</i>

1226
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:51,469
<i>And that just blows.</i>

1227
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,481
[Tim] It's a little bit crazy, Elfi,

1228
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:57,349
that Nastia Liukin threw
a quad twist on floor exercise

1229
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,683
and got a deduction
on a silly technicality.

1230
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:01,017
I can't believe it.

1231
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:04,388
It's a commentary on judging
and how it's gotta change.

1232
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:07,519
[Elfi] Haley Graham gave the
performance of her life tonight.

1233
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:10,565
No way she should've ended up
seventh in the standing.

1234
01:16:10,632 --> 01:16:13,123
[Tim] She might've been
shut out of the all-around,

1235
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:16,068
but judges can't keep her
outta the event finals tomorrow.

1236
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:17,503
Tricia, congratulations.

1237
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,303
How does this win compare
to other competitions for you?

1238
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:23,469
It felt so great. I just wanted
to go in and hit four for four

1239
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:25,513
and qualify for Worlds

- [Elfi] She's goin' for it.

1393
01:25:40,768 --> 01:25:42,633
[Tim] Well, we've seen five athletes,

1394
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:44,831
and no one's done that,
there, an element.

1395
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:47,272
That means that she is
going to be the uneven bar

1396
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:50,311
champion just by that skill alone.

Amazing. She's amazing.

1400
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:14,363

Nastia Liukin will be
the new uneven bar champion.

1405
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:41,653
Well, the athletes have spoken.

1406
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:45,790
And there will be no silver,
no bronze medals on bars today.

Thanks.

It was everybody.

Liukin and Wei Wei Yong yesterday

and Mina Hoyt today,

1411
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:58,273
it's safe to say the athletes
are sending the judges a message.

1412
01:26:58,346 --> 01:26:59,870
[Elfi] This is historic, Tim.

1413
01:26:59,948 --> 01:27:03,281
I've never seen this kind of
organized rebellion before.

1414
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:07,048
Are you going to tell me who is
going to compete and who isn't?

1415
01:27:09,023 --> 01:27:11,321
You're not going
to tell me, are you?

1416
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:15,524
Oops.

1417
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:20,560
'Cause there are alternates
who would like to compete.

1418

and we can still make our point.

1423

No, no, no, we picked you.
We wanna see your routine.

OK. Cool.

[Tim] We have seen
scratch after scratch.

1427

The meet director,
prior to this event,

1428
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:10,141
he decided to put in
the alternate, Tricia Skilken,

1429
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:13,085
because he thought for sure
he'd get a routine out of her.

1430
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:14,246
We'll see.

Two aerial skills,
very nicely done.

Is this how you feel
when you watch my routine?

Uh, yeah.

I am so sorry.

1437
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:34,266
[Elfi] She's looking
really secure in this routine.

1438
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:36,674
Vary exact in all her movements.

1439
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:38,837
Now, she does do
a very interesting skill

what is gonna happen.
I'm not so sure either, Elfi.

[Tim] It's very original,
but I'm afraid the judges

1465
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:01,912
won't know what
to do with that routine, Elfi.

1466
01:31:01,989 --> 01:31:04,617
[Elfi] With those scores,
Tricia will get the gold,

take home a silver.

01:36:56,577 --> 01:37:00,104
Technically, I was the second to
scratch, but I got the ball rolling...

1545
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:02,376
I'm sorry.
Just one second. This is for you.

1546
01:37:02,449 --> 01:37:08,445
Poot? I wanted a pink corsage,
but white will work.

1547
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,225
You'll never guess
what I did today.

1548
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:14,352
[reporters] Carly!

1549
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,726
One second, guys.
Would y'all sign my program?

1550
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:18,697
- Wha?!
- Oh, my gosh...

1551
01:37:18,766 --> 01:37:19,926
...yes!

1552
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,467
So amazing.

1553
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:22,968
Haley. Haley.

1554
01:37:23,037 --> 01:37:24,527
- I need to talk to you.
- OK.

1555
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,308
I got some really
bad news to tell ya.

1556
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:29,808
What?

1557
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:32,402
How much do ya hate
college gymnastics? Hmm?

1558
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:35,141
I decided not to hate things
I've never tried.

1559
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,008
All these schools want me?

1560
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:40,918
- Well, where should I go?
- Eh, you'll figure it out.

1561
01:37:40,988 --> 01:37:44,583
- Maybe I should tell 'em to stick it.
- Yeah, like you know how to stick it.

1562
01:37:44,658 --> 01:37:47,627
- Uh, my feet were glued.
- Yeah, to a high-speed bus.

1563
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,629
You're the one that
told me to floor it.

1564
01:37:49,697 --> 01:37:52,962
[chuckling] Yeah,
you floored it all right.

1565
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:57,163
[rock music]

1566
01:37:57,238 --> 01:37:58,705
[Vick] Huh?

1567
01:37:59,673 --> 01:38:01,732
[Vick] You did it, kid.

1568
