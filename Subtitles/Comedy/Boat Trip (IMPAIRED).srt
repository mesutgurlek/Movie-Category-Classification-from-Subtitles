A couple weeks ago, Jerry and I took a cruise together.

It wasn't the cruise we intended to take, but...

it was a good thingwe got on the wrong boat,because...

Good-bye.

01:26:02,117 --> 01:26:05,120
Uh, Gabriella, wait! Please.

1428
01:26:08,123 --> 01:26:10,125
Mm-hmm?

1429
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:13,128
I thought I was beingreasonably clever...

1430
01:26:13,128 --> 01:26:16,131
considering I just dropped1,500 feet out of an airplane.

1431
01:26:16,131 --> 01:26:18,133
Why'd you bother?

1432
01:26:31,146 --> 01:26:33,148
Because I love you.

1433
01:26:33,148 --> 01:26:37,152
Who loves me--gay Jerry as a friend,

1434
01:26:37,152 --> 01:26:41,156
or is this straight, lying, deceitful Jerry?

1435
01:26:41,156 --> 01:26:44,159
Hmm?

1436
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,161
You've never met this Jerry.

1437
01:26:47,162 --> 01:26:50,165
This is the extremely sorry,

1438
01:26:50,165 --> 01:26:53,168
unbelievably heartbrokenbecause you left me,

1439

will do anything to get youto forgive me...

1440
01:26:56,171 --> 01:26:58,173
because I want to spend the restof my life with you Jerry.

1441
01:27:00,175 --> 01:27:02,177
Well, you listen to me,Jerry.

1442
01:27:03,178 --> 01:27:04,660
Just because you droppedout of the sky...

1443
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:07,182
and made thisgrand romantic gesture...

1444
01:27:07,182 --> 01:27:10,185
doesn't mean thatI'm gonna automaticallyrun into your arms.

1445
01:27:10,185 --> 01:27:12,187
Do you understand that?Hmm?

1446
01:27:12,187 --> 01:27:14,189
Yes.Good.

1447
01:27:17,192 --> 01:27:20,195
Okay. I'm probably going to,but you shouldn'tautomatically expect it.

1448
01:27:20,195 --> 01:27:22,197
Because if we're gonna havethe kind of relationship...

1449
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:25,200
where one day you're gonnabe making all thesehurtful fantasies--

1450
01:27:30,205 --> 01:27:32,207
Don't you ever, ever...
