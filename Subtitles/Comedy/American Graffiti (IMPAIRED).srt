00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,288
Hey, what do
you say, Curt?
Last night in town,

3
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,123
you guys gonna
have a little bash
before you leave?

4
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,666
The Moose have been
looking for you all day.

5
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,168
They got worried.
Thought you were trying

6
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,628
to avoid them
or something.

7
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,379
What is it?
What've you got?

8
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,758
Oh, great.

9
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,135
That's $2,000, man.
$2,000!

10
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,262
Mr. Jennings gave it
to me to give to you.

11
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,555
He says he's sorry
it's so late,

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,681
but it's
the first scholarship

13
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,433
the Moose Lodge
has given out.
(CHUCKLES)

14
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:25,937
And he says they're
all very proud of you
back at the Lodge.

15
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,313
Cute. Why don't you
hold it for me
for a while?

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,815
Hey, I don't want it.
Take it. It's yours.

17
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,566
I'll take it.

STEVE: Listen,
if your sister calls...

19
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,738
I'll talk to you later, okay?
CURT: Wait a second.
Wait a second.

20
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,948
She can wait.

21
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,491
Make it short and sweet,
though, huh?

22
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,742
Listen,

23
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,912
I don't think I'm gonna
be going tomorrow.

24
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,123
Come on, what are you
talking about?

25
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,417
Well, I was thinking
I could wait a year,
you know.

26
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,212
Go to City for a while.

27
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,798
You chicken fink.
Wait a minute.

28
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,717
After all we went through
to get accepted?

29
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,344
We're finally getting
out of this turkey town,

30
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,806
and now you want
to crawl back into
your cell, right?

31
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,310
You want to end up
like John?

32
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,145
You just can't
stay 17 forever.

33
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,856
CURT: It's just...
You've got to get that
through your head!

34
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,316
I just need some time.

35
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,319
I've got to
go talk to Laurie.
Now take it. Take it!

36
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,947
Now, we're leaving in
the morning, all right?

37
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,033
We're leaving
in the morning.

GIRL: Hi, John.

44
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,634
Hi, John.
JOHN: Not too good, huh?

45
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,344
Why is it every girl
that comes around here

46
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,638
is ugly,
or has a boyfriend?

47
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,306
Where is
the dazzling beauty

48
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,725
I've been searching for
all my life?

49
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,644
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

50
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,438
The pickings are
really getting slim.

51
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,690
The whole strip
is shrinking.

52
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,736
I remember about
five years ago,

53
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,321
take you
a couple of hours and

54
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,741
a tank full of gas
just to make one circuit.

55
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,369
It was really something.

(EXCLAIMS)

You gonna go after him?

Hey, listen, Professor.

62
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,512
If he can't find me,
then he ain't even
worth racing, right?

63
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,138
Big shot.

64
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,057

(YAWNS)

66
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,728
Where was I?

67
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,690
How you thought
high school romances
were goofy

68
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,941
and we started
going together

69
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,985
just because
you thought I was
kind of cute and funny,

70
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,112
but then
you suddenly realized
you were in love with me,

71
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,447
it was serious, and...

72
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,996
Oh. You were leading up
to something kind of big.

73
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,040
You make it sound like
I'm giving dictation.

74
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,167
(LAUGHS)

75
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,836
Well, seriously,

76
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:42,008
what I meant was
that since we do care
for each other so much,

77
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,554
and since we should
really consider ourselves
as adults now,

78
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,598
I...

79
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,769
Could I have a couple
of those fries?

80
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,605
TERRY: Come on, Budda.
Come on.

81
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,149
STEVE: Where was I?

82
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,276
LAURIE: "Consider
ourselves adults."
Right. Right.

83
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,779
I thought maybe,
before I leave,

84
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,949
we could agree

85
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,454
that seeing other
people while I'm away

86
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,165
can't possibly hurt,
you know?

87
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,339
You mean
dating other people?

88
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,009
I think
it would strengthen
our relationship.

89
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,304
Then we'd know for sure
that we're really in love.

90
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,639
Not that
there's any doubt.

91
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,317
I think you're right.

92
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,028
I mean,
we're not kids anymore,

93
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,281
and it's silly to think
that when we're
3,000 miles apart,

94
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,784
we shouldn't be able
to see other people
and go out.

95
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,286
Laurie, listen,
I didn't ask
for that back.

96
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,164
I know. I just sort of
think it's juvenile now.

97
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,541
I'll keep it at home.
It's less conspicuous there.

98
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,585
You don't want
to wear it?
I didn't say that.

99
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,921
I understand,
and I'm not upset.

100
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,298
I mean,
I can't expect you

101
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,801
to be a monk
or something
while you're away.

102
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,929
And I got a really neat
record collection.

103
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,681
I even got
Pledging My Love
by Johnny Ace.

104
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,974
Look, how can
you love Nelson

105
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,434
when he's going out
with Marilyn Gator?

106
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,769
Since he dumped
on you, I was...

107
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,938
He didn't dump on me,
you little dip!

108
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,606
Oh, hi, Steve.
Hey.

109
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,234
Hey, Sis.

110
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,449
What's wrong?
Nothing.

111
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,494
What is it?
Nothing!

112
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,665
And I've decided
that I'm gonna let you

113
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,625
take care of my car
for me while I'm away.

114
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,127
At least until Christmas.

115
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,796
See, I'm coming back
for a couple of weeks
at Christmas.

116
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,799
Now, I've got some
very simple instructions
for you.

117
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,134
Here's the keys.

118
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,220
First of all,
only 30-weight Castrol R.

119
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,389
Now, I've written
the tire pressure
and stuff

120
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
on a pad
in the glove...

121
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,142
Are you listening?

122
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,393
Hey, what's wrong?

123
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,728
Are you crying?

124
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,148
I can't believe it.

125
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,483
I don't know
what to say.

126
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,904
I'll love
and protect this car
until death do us part.

127
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,157
This is
a super fine machine.

128
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,285
This might even be better
than Darryl Starbird's
Superfleck Moon...

129
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:18,247
It is! It's better
than Darryl Starbird's
Superfleck Moonbird.

130
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,748
Budda?

131
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,916
Yeah?

132
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,836
How would you like to go
to the drive-in movies
with me?

133
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,172
(LAUGHING) You've got
to be kidding.

134
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,132
No! Would I kid you
about a thing like that?

135
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,050
I have a new car. Hey!

136
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,886
(ALL LAUGHING)

137
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,600
Hey, hey,
did she do that to you?

138
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,059
Hey, Curt,
you want to bomb around?

139
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,353
I want to try out
my new wheels.

140
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,605
Well, I'd like to, Toad,

141
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,773
but I'm gonna go
with Steve and Laurie
to the hop.

142
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,193
And besides,
I'd spoil your luck,
anyway.

143
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,944
Yeah. Right.

144
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,613
Tonight, things are
gonna be different.

145
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,072
Hey, hey,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

146
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,658
You're going to the hop?
The freshman hop?

147
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,076
CURT: Yeah.
Oh, come on, man.

148
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,705
That place is for kids.
You two just got
your ass out of there.

149
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,040
Don't go back there.

150
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,208
CURT: You ain't got
no emotions?

151
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,919
We are going to remember
all of the good times,

152
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,337
is what we're gonna do.

153
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,671
Yeah, well, go.

154
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,423
Why won't you
come with us?

155
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,716

Really, Carol,
don't say anything.

you didn't happen

481
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,083
to be around
the corner of
12th and G

482
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,417
about 8:30 tonight,
did you?

483
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:34,337
No. No, sir.
We were at the movies,
like I said.

Uh-huh.

485
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,051
Milner, the reason
I stopped you was

486
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,136
because the light on
your license plate's out.

487

cite you for that.

It's 12 and a half inches,

Now, it's been
checked several times.

if you like, sir.

with the law.

was you tonight.

We have an excellent
description of this car.

498

I could run you in

make it stick.

But I'm not gonna
do that, Milner.
You know why?

I want to catch you
in the act,

I'm gonna nail you

00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,230
Yes, son?

783
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:02,110
I was wondering,
could you give me
the time?

784
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,238
Oh, sure.
It's 11:45.

785
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:07,365
Yeah. 11:45. Good.
Thanks a lot.

786
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,533
Okay.

787
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,207
Oh, excuse me, sir.

788
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,669
I got a problem.
See, I lost my I. D.
In a flood

789
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,797
and I was wondering,
since you're going
in there anyway,

790
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,467
could you pick me
some Old Harper?
Hard stuff?

791
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:26,843
Would you
buy me a bottle?

792
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,220
Why, certainly.

793
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,889
I lost my wife, too.

794
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,851
Her name wasn't Idy, though,
and it wasn't in a flood.

795
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,186
But I know what you...

796
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,270
Yeah, good.

797
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,898
Here's...
Here's some money.
Old Harper.

798
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:41,900
Great.

799
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:49,908
Hi.
Hi.

800
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,660
11:45.
Right-o.

801
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:52,827
Yeah.

802
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,371
Good night.
Good night.

803
00:47:58,084 --> 00:47:59,417
(ENGINE STARTING)

804
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,131
Hey, no.
Not wine. Hey.

805
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,322
Hi.
Hi.

806
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,534
Say, was there
an old man in here
a minute ago?

807
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,369
Yeah. Just went
out the back.

808
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,329
Want something?

809
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,543
Yeah.
Let me have...

810
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,795
Okay, yeah.
Let me have
a 3 Musketeers

811
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,922
and a ball-point pen,

812
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,175
one of those combs there,
a pint of Old Harper,

813
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,844
a couple of
flashlight batteries

814
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,554
and some beef jerky.

815
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:10,280
Okay. You got an I. D.
For the liquor?

816
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,698
Oh.

817
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,491
Yeah.

818
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,411
Oh, nuts.
I left it in the car.

819
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,580
Sorry. You'll have
to get it before...

820
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,706
Well, I...

821
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,709
I also...
I forgot the car.

822
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:34,471
Hey, did you get it?
You get it, you get it,
you get it?

823
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,556
You got it.
You got it.

824
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,727
You didn't get it.
Why didn't you get it?

825
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,145
Well, I...
I needed some things

826
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,856
and I thought,
as long as I was
in there...

827
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,651
Look, Debbie,
can you loan me a dollar?

828
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,864
Are you for real? Come on.
Girls don't pay. Guys pay.

829
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:56,785
Yeah. Well, see,
I've only got $50 and
he doesn't have change.

830
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,247
Wow. I can't
believe this.

831
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,583
I really
cannot believe this.

832
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:06,336
Here.

833
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,802
Hi, excuse me.
I'm wondering,
could you...

834
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,595
Buy you a bottle
of booze?

835
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:19,057
Yeah, I know.
You lost your I. D.
What kind do you want?

836
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,894
Gee, that's terrific.
Just some Old Harper.

837
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,400
Great.

838
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,971
(WHIMPERING)

839
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,398
That one over there,
that's Freddy Benson's
'vette.

840
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,775
Got his
in a head-on collision
with a drunk.

841
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,569
Boom!

842
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,197
Didn't have a chance.
He was a good driver, too.

843
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,242
It's pretty grim
when a guy gets it,

844
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,994
and it's not
even his own fault.

845
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,705
Needs a paint job,
that's for sure.

846
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,457
See that over there?
That '41?

847
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,750
That used to be,
believe it or not,

848
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,501
the fastest car
in the valley.

849
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,171
I never got a chance
to race Earl, though.

850
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:36,092
He got his in 1955 in
about the hairiest crash
we ever had here.

851
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,386
Jesus, you should
have seen it.

852
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:40,680
Eight kids killed
and both drivers.

853
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,183
The Board of Education
was real impressed,

854
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,976
see, so they come up,
film the whole thing.

855
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,854
Now they show it
in drivers'
education classes.

856
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,106
You'll probably see it
if you get lucky.

857
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:55,570
Course, it's pretty tough
when they take somebody
with them.

858
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,534
You never had
an accident, though.
You told me.

859
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,204
Yeah. Well,
I come mighty close.

860
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,164
I almost rolled it
a couple of times.

861
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,083
But I've been
just quick enough

862
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,710
to stay out
of this graveyard.

863
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,882
Bet you're the fastest.

864
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,719
I've never been beat.
A lot of guys tried.

865
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:24,641
Seems to me
there's more guys lately
than there's ever been.

not much of a scratch.

flies around in circles

938
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,290
all the time?

939
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,833
Do you believe
that's true?

940
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,336
WOLFMAN: Floyd,
I love you, Floyd.

941
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:06,047
Floyd,
is this you, Floyd?

942
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,425
Floyd,
I cannot look on thee,
love took my hand

943
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:13,679
and smiling did reply,
who made the eyes but I?

944
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,933
Floyd, reach out,
touch my soul, Floyd.

945
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,143
OPERATOR: Your
party's ready, sir.
Hello, Floyd!

946
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:20,895
WOMAN: Matilda?
Bye!

947
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,523
You tell her, Wolfman.
He's my man.

948
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:25,817
When I graduate,
I'm gonna be a Wolfman.

949
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,985
Hey, you know,
he broadcasts out
of Mexico someplace?

950
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,322
No, he don't.
I've seen the station
right outside of town.

951
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:36,035
CARLOS: That's just
a clearing station, man,
so he can fool the cops.

952
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,246
He blasts that thing
all the way around
the world.

953
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:39,664
It's against
the law, man.

954
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:41,791
Oh, man, they'll never
catch Wolfman.

955
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,042
CARLOS: No way.

956
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:49,257
Hey, man,
who cut the cheese?

957
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,552
JOE: He who smelt it,
dealt it.

958
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,597
There's that
badass Chevy again.

959
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,642
Oh, look at that snatch
he's got with him.

960
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:01,644
Man, he looks
like a wimp.

961
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,230
Probably is.
Wimps get all the snatch.

962
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,947
Milner ain't
gonna beat that.
His time has come.

963
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:16,701
He's getting old.
He ain't as fast
as he used to be.

964
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,456
You got just two seconds
to get your ass over
in your corner.

965
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,418
Don't worry,
I won't rape you.

967
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,297
You got a bitching car.

968
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:30,840
Yeah, I know.

969
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,301
In fact,
your car's so neat,

970
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,928
we're gonna give
you our special prize.

971
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,889
You want me
to give it to you?

972
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:41,184
Sweetheart,
if the prize is you,
I'm a ready teddy.

973
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,352
Well, get bent, turkey.

Quit laughing.

978
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,031
Let's catch them
at the light,

979
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,490
then you jump out
and flatten their tires.

980
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:57,992
Wait a minute.
Just do what I say.

981
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,244
All right, boss.

01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,391
Wow, it's a really
beautiful night tonight.

985
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:49,353
It's a perfect night
for horseback riding.

986
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:52,315
I was going with a guy
who had horses once.

987
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,401
Oh, yeah?
I had a couple
of horses myself.

988
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,736
Really?
Mmm.

989
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,698
I used them for hunting.
I do a lot of hunting,
you know.

990
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:04,368
Yeah. Deer, mostly.
Got a couple of
bear last year.

991
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,329
Yeah, those were
good ponies.

992
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:08,497
Had to train
them special myself.
Took a lot of time.

993
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:11,500
Yeah?
Do you still have them?
We can go for a ride.

994
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,170
No. No.
I had to sell them

995
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,005
to get these wheels.
And a Jeep.

996
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,883
I got a Jeep pickup
with four-wheel drive.

997
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,260
It's got a gun rack on it,
and I use that
for hunting mostly.

998
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:24,680
Why do you kill
little animals?
I think that's terrible.

999
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:26,307
Oh, well, yeah,

1000
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:30,478
I figure with bears,
though, it's me or them.

1001
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,648
You know, I think
you're really neat.

1002
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,025
Wait a second.

1003
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,611
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1004
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:42,365
I don't know, I guess,
maybe it's the booze
or something.

No, come on.

We're all done out here.

1069

All done?
What's he mean?

1070
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:23,085
He means
we're all done having
loads of fun out here.

before I say goodbye,

1078

I hope you'll be
taking along with you

1079

a little piece
of this place.

to meet you.

goes for me, too.

might make it as

That's not true at all.
I didn't say anything.

Curt just said
at dinner tonight

that he didn't see
what the big hurry was.

1108
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:39,096
He thought that he ought
to stick around and go
to JC for a while,

and try and figure out
what he wanted to
do with his life.

1110

Sure.

to remember you by.

forget you, do you?

No.

You're just sitting there.

gonna remember me

why don't you
just go ahead?

and you know it.

watching your brother.

No.
Whenever he strikes,

1140
01:09:24,786 --> 01:09:27,246
he leaves
a bloody goat's head
next to the victim.

went up to Stockton,

bloody goats' heads
all around,

01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:33,607
Get out.
Just get out
and shut up.

1541
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:34,775
You, too.
Get out. Get out!

1542
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:35,943
TERRY: What's going on?

1543
01:33:36,027 --> 01:33:38,529
I don't know,
but I'm about
to find out.

1544
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:48,330
I can't believe it.

1545
01:33:48,415 --> 01:33:50,457
You practically
get killed trying
to get your car back

1546
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:52,501
and then you
let him have it.

1547
01:33:53,503 --> 01:33:55,045
It's not my car.

1548
01:33:55,505 --> 01:33:56,588
What?

1549
01:33:57,799 --> 01:33:59,383
It is not my car.

1550
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,304
Well, then,
where is your car?

1551
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,682
I don't have a car.

1552
01:34:07,017 --> 01:34:09,018
Well, what about
your Jeep?

1553
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,479
Well, how am I
gonna get home?

1554
01:34:18,445 --> 01:34:21,447
Where's your car?
I have to hang them
on a car.

1555
01:34:22,907 --> 01:34:24,325
I need a ride.

1556
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:29,955
Hey, Toad,
what happened
to you, man?

1557
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:31,540
Did you lose
your car again?

1558
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,500
No, Steve took it.

1559
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:37,838
I want to go to sleep.

1560
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,591
WOLFMAN ON RADIO: You got to
take it easy when you drive
that car of yours.

1561
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:43,510
You've got to
cruise easy, baby.

1562
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:47,348
Don't be
doing any accidents
or anything on me now.

1563
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:51,101
You know, Terry?
I had a pretty
good time tonight.

1564
01:34:51,770 --> 01:34:53,312
Oh, come on.
You're just...

1565
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:54,855
No, no.
Really, really.

1566
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,857
I really
had a good time.

1567
01:34:57,067 --> 01:35:00,277
I mean, you picked me up
and we got some hard stuff,

1568
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:03,864
and saw a holdup,
and then we went
to the canal.

1569
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,783
You got
your car stolen.

1570
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:08,952
And then, I got to
watch you getting sick.

1571
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:12,373
And then,
you got in this
really bitching fight.

1572
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:14,583
I really
had a good time.

1573
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:19,838
Yeah, well, I guess
I have a pretty good time
just about every night.

1574
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:22,341
Well, if I'm not
doing anything tomorrow,

1575
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:24,593
why don't you
give me a call, okay?

1576
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:26,970
Yeah, all right.

1577
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:28,680
I got a little Vespa
that I just kind of

1578
01:35:28,765 --> 01:35:30,265
play around with.
Maybe, you know, we...

1579
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:35,729
Really? Well,
that's almost a motorcycle,
and I just love motorcycles.

1580
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:37,981
You do?
Why didn't you say
something earlier?

1581
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:40,984
We wouldn't have had to
go through all the fun.

1582
01:35:42,404 --> 01:35:43,862
I gotta go.

1583
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:45,656
Ow.

1584
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:50,285
Good night.
See you.

1585
01:36:54,434 --> 01:36:56,310
Hey, what do you want?

1586
01:36:56,895 --> 01:36:59,438
Push the red switch down.

1587
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:05,611
I'm looking
for this girl.

1588
01:37:05,904 --> 01:37:10,157
Yeah. Aren't we all?
She's not here.

1589
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,868
Come on in the back.

1590
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,370
You just go
around the back.

1591
01:37:15,455 --> 01:37:17,289
Thank you.
This way.

1592
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,090
Hey.

1593
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,928
Have a popsicle.
The icebox just broke down

1594
01:37:31,012 --> 01:37:32,012
and they're melting
all over the place.

1595
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:33,847
You want one?
No, no. No thanks.

1596
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:35,307
Listen...

1597
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:36,642
Have a popsicle.

1598
01:37:37,185 --> 01:37:38,936
Are you the Wolfman?

1599
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:40,479
(CHUCKLING)

1600
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:42,272
No, man.
I'm not the Wolfman.

1601
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:47,194
Wait a minute.

1602
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:58,205
WOLFMAN ON TAPE:
Who is this on
the Wolfman's telephone?

1603
01:37:58,331 --> 01:37:59,957
GIRL ON TAPE: Diane.
How're you doing,
Diane?

1604
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,375
That's the Wolfman.

1605
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:02,459
Do you love me?

1606
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:04,002
He's on tape.

1607
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:06,797
(LAUGHS) The man
is on tape. Well...

1608
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:08,966
(SIGHS)

1609
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,635
Where is he now?
I mean,
where does he work?

1610
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,805
The Wolfman
is everywhere.

1611
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:19,810
Well, I gotta give
him this note. Shit!

1612
01:38:20,603 --> 01:38:22,688
GIRL: Can I wizz
on you, Wolfman?
(SOFT ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING)

1613
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:25,649
Here, let me
see the note.

1614
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:32,155
Hell, that's just
a dedication, man.

1615
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,615
What I can do
is I relay it.

1616
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,659
It'll be on
tomorrow or Tuesday.

1617
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,911
No, no. See,
this is very important.

1618
01:38:37,996 --> 01:38:40,080
You see, I may be
leaving town tomorrow

1619
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:41,957
and it's very
important that I...

1620
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:45,002
Damn it. That I reach
this girl right now.

1621
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:48,338
You don't know
whether you're gonna
leave town or not?

1622
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:52,259
Well, I'm supposed
to go to college
back east tomorrow,

1623
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:55,637
and I don't know
if I'm gonna go.
I don't know.

1624
01:38:56,514 --> 01:39:00,017
Wait a minute.
Have a popsicle.
Have a...

1625
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:01,226
Huh?
No. No, thanks.

1626
01:39:01,311 --> 01:39:02,311
Sit down a minute.

1627
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:04,354
(SIGHS)
It's early
in the morning.

1628
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:05,522
Damn.

1629
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:08,859
I can't talk
for the Wolfman,

1630
01:39:08,943 --> 01:39:10,986
but I can tell you
one thing.

1631
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:16,283
If the Wolfman
was here, he'd say,
"Get your ass in gear."

1632
01:39:16,451 --> 01:39:17,784
(LAUGHS)

1633
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:20,037
The Wolfman comes
in here occasionally

1634
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:23,165
bringing tapes, you know,
to check up on me
and whatnot.

1635
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:25,042
And the places
he talks about

1636
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:28,170
that he's been,
the things he's seen.

1637
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:31,381
It's a great, big,
beautiful world out there.

1638
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:36,803
And here I sit,
sucking on popsicles.

1639
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:39,389
Why don't you leave?

1640
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:41,850
I'm not
a young man anymore.

1641
01:39:42,435 --> 01:39:44,603
And the Wolfman
gave me my start

1642
01:39:44,687 --> 01:39:46,396
in the business,
and I like it.

1643
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,441
I tell you what.

1644
01:39:49,776 --> 01:39:52,027
If I can possibly
do it tonight,

1645
01:39:52,403 --> 01:39:55,322
I'll try to relay
this dedication in

1646
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:57,574
and get it on the air
for you later on.

1647
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:01,536
That would be terrific.
Really. Thanks.

1648

Just a minute.

Hey, it's been
a pleasure, really.

01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:08,835
Thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

ain't they?

I know. I got a whole
refrigerator full.

Appreciate it.
See you later.
