1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:05,071
AND THEN THERE'S
A BIG EXPLOSION
AND LOTS OF BUBBLES.

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,073
THAT'S WHERE BABIES
COME FROM.

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,576
(laughing)

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:12,579
OH, WELL, CLOSE ENOUGH.

5
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,081
I DID THE MATH ONCE.

6
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,584
IT TURNS OUT EVERY 17.4 DINNERS

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,086
MY FAMILY ACTUALLY HAS
A PLEASANT MEAL TOGETHER.

8
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,087
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

9
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,089
I MADE A PEA ANGEL.

10
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,091
OH, YOU'RE A PEA ANGEL.

11
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,593
STOP PLAYING WITH YOUR FOOD.

12
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:29,596
(laughs)

13
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,600
OH, MOM...

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,101
DON'T YOU DARE.

15
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,603
RELAX, I WASN'T
REALLY GOING TO.

16
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,604
THEN DON'T.

17
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,605
I WASN'T GOING TO.

18
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,607
THEN DON'T.

19
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,108
WELL, DON'T ACCUSE ME
OF SOMETHING

20
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,610
THAT I WASN'T GOING TO DO.

21
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,614
INTERESTING MOOD SHIFT.

22
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,617
IT WOULD TAKE HOURS TO EXPLAIN
THE PSYCHOLOGY BEHIND THIS.

23
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,619
SO LET ME JUST PUT IT THIS WAY:

24
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,120
DYNAMITE...

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,622
KID WITH MATCHES.

26
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,624
YOU'RE GOING TO THROW
THAT AT MOM?

27
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,125
I WASN'T GOING TO.

28
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,627
JEEZ LOUISE. REESE...

29
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,128
HAL, I CAN HANDLE THIS.

30
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,631
REESE, I'M WARNING YOU.

31
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,632
I WASN'T GOING TO.

32
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,134
BUT IF YOU THINK I WOULD,
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD.

33
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:10,136
OH, GOOD.
NOW HE'S PANICKING.

34
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,640
JUST PUT THE SPOON DOWN
AND APOLOGIZE.

35
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,642
OKAY, SHE GAVE
HIM AN OUT.

36
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,643
APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT?

37
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,144
I WASN'T GOING
TO DO ANYTHING.

38
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:19,145
JUST STOP TALKING!

39
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,147
JUST STOP TALKING
AND LET ME THINK!

40
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,649
DAD, DO SOMETHING.

41
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,651
I GOT IT.

42
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,168
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

43
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,672
I'M BEING CUTE AND SPONTANEOUS?

44
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,678
(laughs)

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,181
(laughing)

46
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,690
DON'T DO IT.

47
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,192
I WASN'T GOING TO.

48
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,195
YEP, THIS IS
A GOOD DINNER.

(bell rings)

62
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,741
MALCOLM.

63
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,745
YEAH?

64
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:01,247
CAN I SEE YOU FOR A MINUTE,
PLEASE?

65
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,750
OOH.

66
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,251
TEACHER'S FAVORITE.

67
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:06,753
TEACHER'S PET.

68
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,757
"DEAR...PENTHOUSE..."

69
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,759
"YESTERDAY I PUSHED
MY FRIEND STEVIE

70
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,760
DOWN SOME STAIRS."

71
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,263
POINT... TAKEN...

72
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:21,768
WHAT?

73
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,770
MALCOLM, I'M
A LITTLE CONCERNED.

74
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,772
YOU'RE DOING VERY WELL
IN YOUR STUDIES

75
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,775
BUT... I STILL SENSE

76
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,277
AN EMOTIONAL DISTANCE
BETWEEN US.

77
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,279
AND I HATE IT.

78
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:37,283
I'D REALLY LIKE US
TO TRY TO CONNECT

79
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,284
ON A DEEPER LEVEL.

80
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,787
WHOA. SHEIS
COMING ON TO ME.

81
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,789
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
DATING THE JANITOR.

82
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,791
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

83
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,292
GOD. ONE DRINK AND...

84
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:47,293
NEVER MIND.

85
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,296
WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS

86
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,799
I KNOW YOUR PARENTS.

87
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,802
I KNOW YOU HAVE
A COLORFUL HOME LIFE.

88
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,805
SO, JUST REMEMBER IF YOU EVER
NEED ANYTHING AT ALL--

89
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,307
A SYMPATHETIC EAR,
A SHOULDER TO CRY ON--

90
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,811
I WANT YOU TO COME TO ME.

91
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,314
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT
I NEED-- ANOTHER MOM.

92
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:09,816
OKAY. GREAT.

93
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:10,817
THANKS A LOT.

94
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,318
WELL, I GOT TO GO

95
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,320
DO THE... THING.

96
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,824
AND THEN I DREW
A ROBOT, FRANCIS.

97
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,325
BUT MY CRAYON BROKE.

98
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,827
AND THEN I HAD
A POPSICLE.

99
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,828
I MEAN

100
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,829
I HAD 12 POPSICLES.

101
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,831
YOU LIKE POPSICLES,
FRANCIS?

102
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:26,833
SHUT UP, DEWEY.
STOP BUGGING FRANCIS.

103
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,334
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

104
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,336
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

105
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,338
DEALING WITH THESE
LITTLE KIDS ALL DAY.

106
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,340
IT'S THE COOLEST THING.

107
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,343
IT'S THE FIRST TIME FRANCIS
IS HOME FROM MILITARY SCHOOL.

108
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,345
MOM AND DAD ARE GOING OFF
TO SOME WEDDING

109
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,348
AND FRANCIS IS IN CHARGE OF US
FOR THE WHOLE WEEKEND.

110
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,850
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH
I MISSED HIM.

111
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,351
HEY.

112
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,352
HMPH.

113
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,354
HE'S SO GREAT.

114
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:52,859
BOYS! THE NUMBER FOR THE HOTEL
IS ON THE COUNTER.

115
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:53,860
I LEFT MONEY FOR PIZZA

116
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,362
BUT I WANT A RECEIPT
AND EXACT CHANGE.

117
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,867
YEP, THAT UNDERWEAR
IS GOING TO WRINKLE.

118
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,870
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND
OF NICE HAVING FRANCIS

119
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,371
BACK IN THE HOUSE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

120
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,373
WHAT?

121
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,876
NOTHING. YOU'RE JUST CUTE

122
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:11,377
WHEN YOU THINK
YOU'RE BEING SUBTLE.

123
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,380
REALLY?

124
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,883
OF COURSE IT'S NICE
HAVING FRANCIS HOME.

125
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,384
WELL, IT'S BEEN
A FEW MONTHS NOW.

126
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,887
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO, YOU KNOW,
THINK ABOUT IT.

127
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,388
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

128
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,391
WE'LL SEE HOW HE
DOES THIS WEEKEND.

129
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,394
GOD, I HATE THIS HAIRDO.

130
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,896
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I BOTHER

131
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,898
TRYING TO IMPRESS
YOUR FAMILY ANYMORE.

132
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:32,899
THEY'VE ALWAYS HATED ME.

133
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,400
WELL, YOU ARE
THE ONE WHO STOLE

134
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,903
THEIR LITTLE HALLY
AWAY FROM THEM.

135
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,074
BETTER GET MOVING.

136
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,408
AND THEN IT GOT AWAY.

137
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,410
BUT I FOUND ANOTHER ONE,
BUT IT DIED.

138
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,411
AND THEN...

139
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,413
I SAID LEAVE HIM
ALONE, YOU BUTT-MUNCH.

140
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,414
LET ME GO.

141
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,415
MAKE ME.

142
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:53,920
GUYS,

143
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,421
QUIT IT.

144
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,924
LISTEN FOR A SECOND.

145
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:58,925
I JUST HEARD MOM AND DAD.

146
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,427
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT
LETTING FRANCIS COME HOME.

147
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,931
YOU SERIOUS?

148
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:05,932
YEAH. THEY WANT TO SEE

149
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,934
HOW HE DOES WITH US
THIS WEEKEND.

150
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:08,935
OKAY? SO WE
CAN'T SCREW UP.

151
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:09,936
COOL.

152
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,437
LET'S GO TELL HIM.
NO.

153
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,940
YOU KNOW HOW FRANCIS GETS WHEN
PEOPLE TELL HIM WHAT TO DO.

154
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,942
I AM WARNING YOU.

155
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,944
IF YOU GET YOUR
NOSE PIERCED,

156
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,946
YOU ARE GOING
TO MILITARY SCHOOL.

157
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,948
AND I MEAN IT. REALLY.

158
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,950
DO YOU HEAR ME?

159
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,452
HEY, MOM.

160
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,455
WHAT'S FOR DINNER?

161
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,957
RIGHT.

162
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:31,958
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

163
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,960
WE'RE GOING TO BE GOOD,
THAT'S WHAT.

164
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,961
HOW DO WE BE GOOD?

165
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:36,462
I DON'T KNOW.

166
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,965
HONESTLY, IT'S NEVER
COME UP BEFORE.

167
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,967
LOOK, WE'RE JUST NOT
GOING TO DO ANYTHING.

168
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,969
THAT WAY, WE CAN'T
GET IN ANY TROUBLE.

169
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,470
Hal:
HONEY.

170
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,973
WE'RE LATE.
WE BETTER HIT THE ROAD.

171
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,976
FINE. I'LL SHAVE
MY LEGS IN THE CAR.

172
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:50,977
OKAY.

173
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,478
I'VE MARKED THE
LIQUOR BOTTLES

174
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:53,980
AND WE CAN TASTE WHEN
THEY'RE WATERED DOWN.

175
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,481
I'VE LOCKED OUT
THE SMUT CHANNEL,

176
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,482
COUNTED YOUR
FATHER'S CIGARS.

177
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:57,984
I'VE CHECKED THE ODOMETER
ON THE CAR

178
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:59,485
AND THE BALANCE
ON THE CREDIT CARDS.

179
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,487
WE LOVE YOU,
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

180
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,989
AND JUST REMEMBER,
DEWEY WILL TELL US

181
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,991
EVERYTHING YOU DID
WHILE WE'RE GONE.

182
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,993
UH, WHAT YOUR
MOTHER SAID, BOYS.

183
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,995
MINUS ONE.

184
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:17,003
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

185
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,005
THINK ABOUT WHAT?

186
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,007
SHE'S BLUFFING.

187
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,009
OKAY, I AM GOING
TO SHOW YOU GUYS

188
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,510
THE COOLEST THING
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.

189
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,512
GET ME SOME
LIGHTER FLUID

190
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,015
A WAFFLE IRON AND ONE OF
DEWEY'S STUFFED ANIMALS.

191
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,516
THE FURRIER, THE BETTER.

192
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,019
ACTUALLY, WE'RE
KIND OF TIRED.

193
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,520
TIRED?

194
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,522
YEAH. TIRED.

195
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,524
I'M NOT TIRED.

196
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,027
OKAY, YEAH, I'M TIRED.

197
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,029
LET'S JUST GO
WATCH TV.

198
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,032
WHATEVER.

199
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,039
THIS PLAN BETTER WORK.

200
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,041
THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN NO TV

201
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,543
IS GOLF ON TV.

202
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,046
OH, COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

203
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,047
LET'S GO DO SOMETHING.

204
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,049
NO. THEY'RE ONLY
ON THE SIXTH HOLE.

205
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:06,552
THEY'RE ONLY ON THE SIXTH HOLE.

206
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,054
(telephone rings)

207
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,555
HELLO.

208
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,058
FRANCIS, BUD, I HEARD YOU
WERE IN TOWN.

209
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:13,559
YOU DA MAN, FRANCIS!

210
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,062
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON?

211
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,564
SAME OLD,
SAME OLD, MAN.

212
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,068
OH, CIRCUS SAYS HI.

213
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,570
DUDE, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE IT.

214
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,072
I FINALLY MOVED OUT.

215
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,573
I'M LIVING IN THE
BASEMENT NOW.

216
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,075
TOTAL FREEDOM, DUDE.

217
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,576
YOU DA MAN, FRANCIS!

218
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,580
MOM, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO KNOCK.

219
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,082
DUDE, WE'RE COMING OVER.

220
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,084
OKAY. HEY, RICHIE AND THE GUYS
ARE COMING OVER.

221
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,585
MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T.

222
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,088
YOU KNOW, MOM AND DAD
ARE GONE.

223
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:44,090
OKAY, GOT IT.
RICHIE, LISTEN TO ME.

224
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,592
I'm watching my brothers,
so we got to hang here.

225
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,594
AND NO PARTIES OKAY?

226
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,595
I'M SERIOUS.

227
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,097
IT'S GOT TO BE
JUST THE THREE OF YOU.

228
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,102
HUH. YOU WOULDN'T THINK
ONLY THREE GUYS

229
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:57,603
COULD DO SO MUCH DAMAGE.

230
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,106
CALL US NEXT TIME
YOU'RE IN TOWN.

231
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,107
YOU DA MAN, FRANCIS!

232
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,616
♪♪ SKYROCKETS IN FLIGHT ♪♪

233
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,118
♪♪ AFTERNOON DELIGHT... ♪♪

234
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,620
ARE YOU TRYING
TO SEDUCE ME?

235
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,622
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
GOING TO THIS WEDDING.

236
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,124
WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.

237
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,126
OH, COME ON, I PROMISE
IT'LL BE FUN.

238
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,627
HAL, I'M NOT DEWEY.

239
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,629
SORRY. BUT STILL,
WE'RE ALONE,

240
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,631
WE'RE AWAY FROM THE KIDS.

241
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:29,635
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE JUST
TWO UNENCUMBERED
CONSENTING ADULTS.

242
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:32,638
I SAY WE ENJOY IT.

243
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,639
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

244
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,143
IT WILL BE NICE TO HAVE SOME
TIME FOR JUST THE TWO OF US.

245
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,644
AND I'M GOING TO LOVE
NOT HAVING

246
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,148
TO YELL AT SOMEBODY
EVERY 20 SECONDS.

247
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:46,152
EITHER SPEED UP OR GET
OFF THE ROAD, JACKASS!

248
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,654
ABSOLUTELY DESERVED IT.

249
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,159
(spitting):
I HATE THOSE GUYS.

250
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,162
DID YOU SEE CIRCUS BREAK THAT
CINDER BLOCK WITH HIS HEAD?

251
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,164
THAT'S A GOOD LESSON
FOR YOU GUYS.

252
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,166
IT DIDN'T BREAK
THE FIRST SIX TIMES.

253
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,168
BUT DID HE QUIT TRYING?
NO, SIR.

254
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,171
FRANCIS, WE HAVE
TO CLEAN THIS UP.

255
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,172
YEAH.

256
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,173
NO. I MEAN NOW.

257
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,175
IF MOM AND DAD SEE THIS
THEY'LL FREAK.

258
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,677
SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?
THEY ALWAYS FREAK.

259
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,179
I'M USED TO IT.

260
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,680
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
 WE HAVE TO CLEAN UP.

261
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,682
WHAT'S WITH YOU GUYS?
I'M IN CHARGE HERE.

262
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,684
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'LL
GET IN TROUBLE. RELAX.

263
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,686
BUT WE WANT YOU TO COME HOME.

264
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,188
WHAT?

265
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,190
I HEARD MOM AND DAD TALKING.

266
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,692
THIS WEEKEND IS LIKE
A TEST FOR YOU, OR A TRAP.

267
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,194
IF YOU DO GOOD,
THEY MAY LET YOU COME HOME.

268
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,697
AND IF YOU DON'T,
THEY'RE GONNA TOSS YOUR BUTT
BACK INTO MILITARY SCHOOL.

269
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,199
OKAY, LOOK...

270
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,201
FRANCIS,
IT SUCKS AROUND HERE
WITHOUT YOU.

271
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,203
CAN'T YOU JUST TRY
FOR OUR SAKE?

272
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,205
LOOK, GUYS, I APPRECIATE
YOUR SENTIMENT.

273
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,707
BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO DECIDE MY WHOLE FUTURE

274
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,709
BASED ON HOW I BEHAVE
OVER ONE WEEKEND

275
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,711
WITHOUT EVEN TELLING ME
ABOUT IT.

276
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,713
IT'S TOO ARBITRARY.
IT'S UNREASONABLE.

277
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,215
IT'S MOM.

278
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,217

THE HOUSE HAS NEVER
BEEN THIS CLEAN.

284
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,245
UH-OH.

285
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,246
WHAT?

286
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,248
IT'S TOO CLEAN.

287
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,250
YOU'RE RIGHT.

288
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,751

WE'RE THE ONLY ONES

296
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,785
WHO GAVE THEM POT HOLDERS.

297
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:03,789
HI.
HI.

298
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,291
IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU.

299
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,293
YOU, TOO.
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.

300
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,795
HOW LONG DO YOU
THINK IT'S BEEN?

301
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,796
I DON'T KNOW.

302
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,299
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME?

303
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,809
WELL, THAT WAS WORTH
DRIVING 600 MILES FOR.

304
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,311
WHO WAS THAT GUY?

305
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,814
IT'S THE GROOM, HAL.

306
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:32,318
I WISH PEOPLE WOULD WEAR
NAME TAGS AT THESE THINGS.

307
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,321
OH, PERFECT.

308
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,323
NICE TOUCH WITH THE
BREAD CRUMBS, DEWEY.

309
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,824
HUH?

310
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:39,825
I CLIPPED MY TOENAILS

311
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,327
ON THE COFFEE TABLE.

312
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:43,329
ATTABOY. SHE WILL
NEVER KNOW A THING.

313
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:44,830
WAIT.

314
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:50,836
TA-DA!

315
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,345
OW! OW! OW! OW!

316
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,847
MALCOLM!
MALCOLM, ARE YOU OKAY?

317
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,849
I THINK SO.

318
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:04,850
OW!!!

319
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,851
HOLD STILL.

320
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,852
COME HERE
AND LET ME SEE IT.

321
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:07,853
LET ME SEE IT.

322
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,355
HOW DOES IT LOOK?

323
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,356
NOT... TOO BAD.

324
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,857
PUT HIS FACE BACK ON!

325
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,859
OH, MAN, WHAT'S
THAT WHITE STUFF?

326
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,362
- IS THAT BONE?
- WHAT?!

327
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,363
GET ICE
AND SOME PAPER TOWELS.

328
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,864
WE HAVE
TO PUT PRESSURE ON IT.

329
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,366
OW! OW! OW!
I'M SORRY.

330
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,867
I HAVE
TO PUT PRESSURE ON IT.

331
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:22,868
REESE, GIVE ME THE ICE!

332
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,370
WE DON'T HAVE ANY.
WE'VE GOT THIS.

333
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,872
FINE. GIVE ME SOME ANTISEPTIC.

334
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:27,873
(phone ringing)

335
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,375
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

336
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,376
Dewey:
HELLO.

337
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,377
Lois:
Hi, Dewey.

338
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,378
HI, MOM.

339
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,879
WE'RE JUST CALLING TO CHECK IN.

340
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,880
LET ME SPEAK WITH FRANCIS.

341
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,382
HE'S...

342
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,884
IN THE BATHROOM.

343
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,386
WELL, LET ME TALK TO MALCOLM.

344
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,388
HE'S IN THE BATHROOM.

345
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,889
THEY'RE BOTH IN THE BATHROOM?

346
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,391
WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN THERE?

347
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,892
I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

348
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,397
WE HAVE TO GET YOU STITCHES.

349
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,398
LET'S GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

350
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,399
NO! YOU CAN'T.

351
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,900
MOM AND DAD
WILL FIND OUT.

352
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,902
MALCOLM,
THIS IS A HEAD INJURY.

353
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,404
YOU COULD HAVE A CONCUSSION.

354
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,906
CONCUSSION? I THINK
HE'S MAKING TOO MUCH OF THIS.

355
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,908
I'M NOT AS FIGGLED
AS HE HOOGERS.

356
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:03,909
NO!

357
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:04,910
I DON'T CARE.

358
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,412
I'M NOT GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.

359
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,413
DO YOU HEAR ME?

360
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,415
THERE IS NO WAY THAT I...

361
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,417
GET THE CAR!

362
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,421
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

363
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,923
YOU WANT TO GET BLOOD
ALL OVER THE CAR?

364
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,425
WAIT! WE CAN'T TAKE THE CAR.

365
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:20,426
THEY'LL KNOW.

366
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,428
MOM CHECKED THE ODOMETER,
REMEMBER?

367
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,429
I'M ON TOP OF IT.

368
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,433
WHEE! HI, SCHOOL!

369
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,435
OH, MALCOLM, YOU
SHOULD SEE THIS!

370
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,936
FRANCIS IS
KICKING ASS!

371
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:31,937
(radio blasting)

372
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,439
I HATE THIS '80s CRAP.

373
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,441
ONE GOOD THING
ABOUT A HEAD INJURY:

374
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:38,444
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
I WON'T REMEMBER ANY OF THIS.

375
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,446
OH, GREAT. A
ONE-WAY STREET.

376
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,948
HOW DOES THAT WORK IF
I'M GOING BACKWARDS?

377
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,950
AND ON THIS JOYOUS DAY

378
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,953
AS WE CELEBRATE THE OCCASION
OF TWO SOULS

379
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,956
JOINING INTO ONE...

380
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,958
DO YOU THINK THIS
IS GOING TO BE

381
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,460
ONE OF THOSE LONG SERVICES?

382
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,464
WHAT'S WRONG?

383
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:01,967
DID YOU KNOW
THAT YOUR FAMILY

384
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,969
HAS GIVEN ME A NICKNAME?

385
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:04,970
REALLY?

386
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,971
THAT'S NICE.

387
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,473
WHAT IS IT?

388
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:13,479
LOIS... COMMON... DENOMINATOR.

389
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,484
HEY, COME ON.

390
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,486
IT'S JUST THAT THEY'VE
NEVER SEEN ANYONE LIKE YOU.

391
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,989
I MEAN, YOU'RE, YOU'RE
HONEST, AND, UH...

392
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,991
UNPRETENTIOUS.

393
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,493
DIRECT.

394
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,996
THEY'RE BAFFLED BY THAT.

395
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,999
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT GETS YOU, LOIS

396
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,501
AND, FRANKLY, I...

397
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,003
I LIKE THAT.

398
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,507
KIND OF MAKES YOU
MY SECRET TREASURE.

399
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,514
OH, HAL.

400
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,017
...BETWEEN
THE LORD AND US,

401
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:57,523
HIS SERVANTS, TWO PEOPLE
BROUGHT TOGETHER IN LOVE...

402
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,526
(moaning softly)

403
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,539
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

404
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,040
YOU KIDS AGAIN?

405
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,542
AND A HEAD INJURY.

406
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:20,045
YOU BOYS LIKE TO KEEP IT
INTERESTING, DON'T YOU?

407
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,548
WE KIND OF HAVE A HISTORY HERE.

408
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,049
♪♪ I WAS IN
  THE RIGHT PLACE ♪♪

409

414
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,070
LOOK, DOC, UH,
ABOUT THE BILL...

415
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,072
OH, DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL SEND IT
TO YOUR PARENTS.

416
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,073
YEAH, WELL...

417
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,576
WE WERE KIND OF THINKING
WE'D PAY FOR IT NOW.

418
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,579
OKEYDOKEY, BUT IT'S PROBABLY
GOING TO BE ABOUT $400.

419
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,080
WHAT?!
$400?

420
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,084
DON'T YOU HAVE
A FREQUENT CUSTOMER DISCOUNT
LIKE AT THE CAR WASH?

421
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,586
OR MAYBE WE COULD WORK IT OFF.

422
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,088
WE COULD EMPTY BEDPANS,
OR WASH CADAVERS.

423
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,591
IT'S PROBABLY NOT NEARLY AS COOL
AS IT SOUNDS.

424
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,593
SORRY.

425
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,098
WELL, WE'RE SCREWED.

426
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,100
COME ON, THERE'S
GOT TO BE SOMETHING

427
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,102
WE CAN DO, SOMEONE
WE CAN CALL.

428
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:19,104
THERE'S NO ONE, MALCOLM.

429
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,106
ACTUALLY,
THERE MIGHT BE,

430
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,609
BUT I'M NOT SURE
IF IT'S WORTH IT.

431
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,110
(gasping):
OH, MALCOLM!

432
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,612
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

433
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,614
SORRY IT TOOK
ME SO LONG.

434
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,115
I WAS HAVING A CHARDONNAY
WHEN YOU CALLED

435
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,618
AND I HAD TO TAKE A CAB.

436
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,621
OH, GOD, I KNEW WE MADE
A DEEPER CONNECTION.
I JUST KNEW IT.

437
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,122
NOW IT'S GOING TO BE HARD

438
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,625
TO TURN AGAINST YOUR PARENTS,
BUT IN TIME YOU'LL SEE...

439
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,626
NO! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

440
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,127
MY PARENTS DIDN'T DO THIS.

441
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,128
IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT

442
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,130
AND THEY CAN'T FIND OUT
ABOUT IT.

443
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,131
WHAT?

444
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,133
IT'S KIND OF COMPLICATED.

445
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,135
SEE, MY PARENTS ARE AWAY
AT A WEDDING

446
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,637
AND MY BROTHER IS HOME

447
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,138
FROM MILITARY SCHOOL
TO TAKE CARE OF US.

448
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,640
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE

449
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,142
SHOULD BE PUNISHED JUST 'CAUSE
THEIR DAD USES CHEAP NAILS.

450
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,144
WE NEED $400, LADY.

451
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:00,646
WILL YOU LET ME TALK?!

452
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,148
WE NEED THE MONEY
FOR THE DOCTOR BILL

453
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,651
BECAUSE IF MY PARENTS FIND OUT
THAT I GOT HURT

454
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,654
THEN THEY'LL SEND FRANCIS AWAY,
AND WE'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN,

455
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,157
AND, YOU KNOW, WE LOVE HIM.

456
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,661
MALCOLM, I CAN'T DO THAT.

457
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,664
BUT YOU SAID
IF I EVER NEEDED ANYTHING...

458
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,166
YES, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT EMOTIONAL STUFF.

459
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:25,671
I... DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT A TEACHER EARNS?

460
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:28,674
I HAVE $62 IN MY
CHECKING ACCOUNT.

461
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:29,675
THEY TAKE CREDIT CARDS.

462
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,177
I'M SORRY.

463
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:36,181
I'M... I'M, I'M JUST SORRY.

464
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,686
WE CAN BREAK HER.

465
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,187
GUILT. GO FOR GUILT.

466
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,689
I GOT IT.

467
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,190
THAT'S OKAY.

468
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,693
THANKS, ANYWAY.

469
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,695
WELL, SQUIRT,

470
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,698
LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO BE
GOING BACK TO MILITARY SCHOOL

471
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,700
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO SEE YOU FOR A REALLY,

472
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,201
REALLY LONG TIME.

473
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,703
BUT I NEED YOU

474
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,704
TO BE BRAVE.

475
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,205
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME,
SQUIRT?

476
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,207
STOP, FRANCIS!

477
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,709
I WISH I COULD,
KIDDO,

478
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,210
BUT I CAN'T.

479
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:08,714
(Dewey crying)

480
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,215
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

481
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,217
I'M NOT DOING THIS, DEWEY.

482
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,219
IT'S JUST THE WAY LIFE IS
SOMETIMES.

483
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,721
(Dewey crying)

484
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,723
PLEASE STOP CRYING.

485
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,725
IT HURTS!
I KNOW IT DOES.

486
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,226
IT HURTS ME, TOO.

487
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,729
WAIT! I'LL, I'LL DO IT.

488
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,231
I GUESS JAMAICA
ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

489
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,234
WHERE IS MY CREDIT CARD?

490
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,736
IT FELL OUT
OF YOUR WALLET.

491
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,237
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

492
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,238
LET'S GO.

493
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,740
PROCESSING IS
RIGHT OVER THERE.

494
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,241
RIGHT NEAR THE
VENDING MACHINES.

495
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,242
DO YOU HAVE ANY CHANGE?

496
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,744
THANK YOU.

497
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,746
WAY TO TAKE ONE
FOR THE TEAM, BUDDY.

498
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,247
WHEN WE GET HOME

499
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,249
YOU CAN EAT ICE CREAM
UNTIL YOU PUKE.

500
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,252
(still sobbing):
YAY.

501
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:51,256
(whooping and laughing)

502
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,765
(groaning and exclaiming)
HEY!OCUPADO!

503
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,273
HUH. WELL...

504
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:09,775
I DON'T SEE ANY HOLES

505
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,277
OR CRAPPY ATTEMPTS
TO PLASTER THEM UP.

506
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,780
BUT I'M SURE THERE'S SOMETHING.

507
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,782
THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.

508
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,786
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING
UNDERNEATH THAT HAT?

509
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,788
NOTHING.
I WAS JUST WEARING...

510
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,796
YOU BOYS.

511
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,298
THAT'SIT?!

512
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,800
SO, YOU GUYS THINK
FRANCIS DID A GOOD JOB

513
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,301
TAKING CARE OF US, THEN?

514
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,302
OH, A GREAT JOB.

515
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,303
Lois:
ABSOLUTELY.

516
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,305
YOU KNOW, FRANCIS,
WE WERE HAVING OUR DOUBTS

517
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,808
ABOUT THAT SCHOOL, BUT
IT'S REALLY MATURED YOU.

518
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,811
IN FACT, I THINK IT'S THE
BEST DECISION WE EVER MADE.

519
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:46,812
(chuckling)

520
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,817
MOM: 62,437...

521
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,819
KIDS: ZERO.

522
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,324
SO, WE GET TO SEE FRANCIS AGAIN
IN A MONTH OR TWO.

523
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,827
I KNOW. IT SUCKS,
BUT WE GAVE IT A SHOT.

524
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,328
AND SCHOOL'S EASIER NOW

525
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:06,832
BECAUSE CAROLINE WON'T EVEN
MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH ME ANYMORE

526
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,334
SO IT WASN'T A COMPLETE WASTE,
AND MOM ALWAYS SAYS

527
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,838
IT'S NOT A WASTED EXPERIENCE
IF YOU LEARN SOMETHING FROM IT

528
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,840
AND I DEFINITELY THINK I DID.

529
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,342
OKAY! READY!
