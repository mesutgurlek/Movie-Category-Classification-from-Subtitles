<i>I, Reuben, take you, Lisa</i>...

I, Reuben, take you, Lisa,

3
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,250
to be my lawfully wedded wife.

4
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,758
I do. I do.

5
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,955
Hey, Lois.
The room looks beautiful.

6
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,159
Oh, thanks. And all the candles
have been replaced...

7
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,759
with these mini-lamps you asked for,
so now no more fire hazard.
Great.

8
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,567
<i>Hey, did we sanitize these things?</i>
Reuben!

9
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,167
- The best man is in the house! Ohh!
- Oh!

10

- <i>Oh, my God.!</i>
- Sandy, you okay?

11
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,406
Jorgè, ice.
The best man went down.

12
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,848
Dance floor's like a Slip 'N Slide, dude.
I thought I told them not to wax this.

13
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,852
Twenty-three percent of the guests
are over 70.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,048
I don't want anyone breaking a hip.
Okay. Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of it.

15
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,921
All right. I analyze risk for a living.
It's my job to worry.

16
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,290
Okay, let me do the worrying
'cause you gotta get married.
Right.

17
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,852
I'm good.

18
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,957
You got my note that
Harry Bard at table seven
is violently allergic to seafood?

19
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,468
Yes. His chicken will go
nowhere near the fish.

20
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,937
We're putting the finishing touches
on the cake.
This looks great. Lisa's gonna love it.

21
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,030
Hit me, dude.

22
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,707
Hey, aren't you that kid
from <i>Crocodile Tears?</i>

23
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,685
That's right. I'm Sandy Lyle.

24
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,721
Man, I saw that movie in high school.

25
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,019
That bagpipe scene,
that was the funniest shit, man.

26
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,218
We had a good time on that picture.
You want an autograph?

27
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,454
Ah, no, thanks.
It's good to see you, man.

28
00:02:09,529 --> 00:02:12,555
I thought you died,
like, 15 years ago.

29
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,696
Ah. Nah.
I'm very much alive, my friend.

30
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,863
I've been doing a lot of stage acting.
Getting back to my roots.

31
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,873
- Sandy, we should get going 'cause...
- They're making an
<i>E.! True Hollywood Story</i> on me,

32
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,841
so that should clear up
a lot of your questions.

33
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,844
So they're really doing
one of those shows about your life?

34
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,210
Yeah. I got a camera crew
following me around
the next few weeks.

35
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,579
It's gonna be huge.
Wow. That's cool.

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,380
Reuben. Two-minute warning.
Lisa's on her way down.
Okay, thanks.

37
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,445
Look, Reuben.
Yeah.

38
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,650
Now, I'm asking you this because
you're my oldest friend in the world.

39
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,659
Uh-huh.
And I'm your wingman.

40
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,093
Okay. What?

41
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,496
Are you sure you wanna do this?

42
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:51,731
Sandy, there's not a doubt
in my mind.

43
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:55,205
Okay? I found the perfect woman.

We're totally in love.

Ohh!

Hello, everybody.
I'm Stan Indursky, Reuben's boss.

I've been waiting for this day
my entire life.

72
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,793
And about four and a half years ago,
I met a real estate agent named
Lisa Kramer,

<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Lisa.!</i>

just so she'd go out with me.

75
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,030
I gave him a good price.
Yeah, not good enough.

76
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,800
She's a killer. No, seriously, um...

77
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:37,274
After about a month of dating,
I knew she was the one.

<i>[Woman] Aw.</i>

dreaming about for so long,

80
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:49,086
the woman I'm standing
next to... is you.

Oh, right, right. That's right.

It's probably off the market anyway.

Why do you say that?

How could you let Polly
pick the restaurant?

She called me, like, seven times...

that was just salsa.

What is that?

Um, what else?
Look, the thing is,

746
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:59,190
I assess risk for a living,
so I know that I have a.013% chance...

747
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,197
of being hit by a car
on my way home,

of falling through a subway grate.

749
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:07,467

So I try to manage that risk
by avoiding danger...

and having a plan and
knowing what my next move is,

751
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,570

live your life that way.

You're goddamn right I am.

1321
01:19:56,792 --> 01:20:00,819
I thought so.
Impressive presentation.
He's insured.

1327
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:30,516
Reuben, it's too late.
I have to be on a plane
in, like, 45 minutes.

1328
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:32,526
I don't think
you really wanna leave here.

1329
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:35,586
You have no idea what I want.

1330
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,757
You left Rodolfo behind.
Does that mean anything to you?

1331
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:43,638
Look, I made a mistake, all right?
I should've never put you in
the Riskmaster.

1332
01:20:43,705 --> 01:20:45,866
Truth is, no matter
what happened on our honeymoon,

1333
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:48,375
you're much riskier
than Lisa could ever be.
Yes.

1334
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,707
Right. That's why
it's not gonna work out between us.

1335
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:53,976
Reuben, you are a nice, safe,
conventional guy.

1336
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,983
Just...
It's not gonna work out.

1337
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,713
I don't think
that's who I really am.

1338
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:00,880
It is, Reuben.
That's okay.

1339
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:03,789
What do I have to do
to prove it to you? Huh?

1340
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,918
Hey!
Huh?

1341
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:09,157
What are you...
Oh, my God.

1342
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,722
Hey, look.
Look, I'm eating nuts.

1343
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,302
- What the hell are you doing?
- Those nuts aren't even dirty.

1344
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,361
Hey.

1345
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:20,599
Oh!

1346
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:26,476
Since we've been together,
I've felt more uncomfortable,

1347
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,482
out of place, embarrassed...

1348
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,485
and just physically sick
than I have in my entire life.

1349
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,487
<i>But I couldn't have</i>
<i>gone through all that</i>...

1350
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:38,424
I couldn't have thrown up
19 times in 48 days...

1351
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:40,984
if I wasn't in love with you.

1352
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,527
<i>Maybe you were right.</i>
<i>Maybe this is just a fling.</i>

1353
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:48,728
But if you get on that plane
and you go to Cincinnati...

1354
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:50,998
or Tanzania
or wherever you're going,

1355
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,734
we'll never know if
it could've been something more.

1356
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,635
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

1357
01:21:57,712 --> 01:22:01,910
No. Oh, no.
N-No.

1358
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:11,223
- Oh, Reuben.
- Please don't eat those.

1359
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,562
<i>No, really.</i>

1360
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,120
Oh, God.

1361
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:24,628
I don't want you to go away, Polly.

1362
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:28,141
I'm not gonna marry you, Reuben.

1363
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:31,235
I don't wanna get married.

1364
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:33,873
I just wanna take you to dinner...

1365
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,883
sometime this week.

1366
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,052
Can I pick the place?

1367
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:00,597
Solid.

1368
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:03,710
Excuse me. Hi. Hello.

1369

<i>I see you two are new to the island.</i>
<i>I want to come have a meet</i>...

Oh, my stars and stripe.

Oh, my God.
I cannot believe it is you.
This is Polly.

Hi, Polly.
I am Claude.

1373
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:17,719
Wow. Hi.
So how's it goin'?

1374
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:20,124
In truth, uh,

1375
01:23:20,195 --> 01:23:22,686
it has been a little bit
tough noogies for me.

1376
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:25,790
Lisa, she... she broke my heart.

1377
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:29,030
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Ah. That is life, huh?

1378
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:31,766
Well, you have to be like the hippo.

1379
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,276
Exactly. Like the hippo.

1380
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:39,871
So, let me guess.
You are here on honeymoon again?
This is your beautiful bride?

1381
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:42,416
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We're just, uh...
We're just hangin' out.

1382
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,475
Oh, come on.
It's a little more serious than that.

1383
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:46,577
Well, yeah.
I'm just sayin' we're not married.
Right.

1384
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:49,316
- <i>No, defi</i>n<i>itely not married.</i>
<i>But it's possible.</i>
- It is possible.

1385
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:52,451
<i>We're takin'things step by step,</i>
<i>seein'how they work out.</i>

1386
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:55,018
Okay, I don't really understand
what you are talking about,

1387
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:58,122
but, uh, any chance
you are for scuba today?

1388
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,463
You know what?
Actually, we are for scuba.

1389
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:03,095
- No way, Jose!
- Yes way, Jose!

1390
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:05,298
But we're goin' out with that guy.

As long as you are for scuba, Leuban,
I am happy.

1393
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,483
Oh. Sweet.
