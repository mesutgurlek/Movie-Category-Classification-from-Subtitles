the whore, the crone."

stealing your cabs,

and overwhelming you
with perfume in elevators."

95
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:09,858
"But perhaps in fairness
to the fairer sex,

some new goddesses to the pantheon."

for deity the cheerleader, the coed...

of which concerns me most today."

"In ancient Greece, this fearsome female
was known as Erinys,

100

101
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:28,499
"In India, she is Kali,

her boyfriend Shiva's entrails..."

to bother with something silly
like accuracy in reporting.

Which is understandable, because
with a man-eater like me on the loose,

If you fabricate your facts,
you get fired.

00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:13,132
- A week from Sunday.
- Let's put this here like this...

304
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:16,218
because this aroma therapy
can get a little strong.

305
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,553
The lavender,
we don't want to put you to sleep.

306
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:20,096
[Ike] You nervous?

307
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,807
I've never been more certain
of anything in my life.

308
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,602
Except I've been having
all kinds of weird dreams.

309
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:29,437
Mm-hmm. Would you like
to tell me about 'em?

310
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:31,439
Yeah, sure.

311
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:35,151
- [Maggie] And another one.
- Pete, I'll be right with ya.

312
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:38,362
[Maggie] I go inside the church
and everyone I know is there.

313
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:42,907
The creepiest part is
I look down at my dress, and it's red!

314
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,160
I don't know what that means.
Red is not my color.

315
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,080
What do you think?

316
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:52,624
- I think you'd look good in red.
- No, no.

317

Thank you.

321
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:17,311
Excuse me, sir. Do you know where I can
get some shampoo? Strong shampoo?

322
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:21,147
Doc's pharmacy. Third and Elm.
Tell 'em Pete sent ya.

323
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:23,191
You want my hat?

324
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:27,111
No, no, I'm fine.
You might need it.

325
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:39,163
Mr. Graham, if you're looking
for Elm Street, it's that way.

326
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,414
Thank you.

327
00:19:41,498 --> 00:19:44,459
If you came down here in the pursuit of
happiness, you might as well go back...

328
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,586
because you can't make me feel bad.

329
00:19:46,627 --> 00:19:50,839
I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
I'm here for vindication.

330
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:54,008
In my heart,
I feel I'm right about you.

331
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,676
Mmm.

332
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,803
You got me fired, lady.

333
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:02,641
You destroyed my reputation,
and you screwed up my hair.

334
00:20:02,682 --> 00:20:05,643
You chew up men,
spit 'em out and love it.

335
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:08,896
You're gonna do the same thing
to this poor schmuck number four...

336
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:11,440
that you did
to the previous three.

337
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:13,441
You're gonna run again.

338
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:15,735
And I'm not leaving until you do.

339
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:21,532
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I still have my job.

340

Hey, kid, kid, kid,
wait a minute.

341
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:32,958
- Give you ten bucks for the hat.
- Sure!

342
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,627
That's right.

I'm telling you,
that is a photo opportunity.

346

When I only see one dog,
I know I've had too much to drink.

Hey, you'll never guess...

with his tail between his legs.

349

[Walter]
Who?

350
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:10,406
Hello, Maggie.

351
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:14,034
[Ike] I just came over
to apologize to your family.

352
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:16,369
When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

353
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:19,205
I pushed a story.
I made a mistake.

354
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:24,543
In other words, he's only human.
And he brought us a bottle of wine.

355
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:28,421
-Made me put my hat back on.
-Yeah. It scared the hell outta Skipper.

You've gotta be kidding me.

No, no. You should've seen Skipper.

It wasn't that... funny.

361
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:46,228
Actually, it's been quite amusing.

362
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:50,106
Walter, here, has been sharing his
father of the bride wedding memories.

363
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,775
You know what?

364
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:56,778
I think I'll take this to the kitchen.
[Mouthing Words]

365
00:21:56,862 --> 00:22:00,698
I'll help you bring it in...
to the kitchen.

366
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,992
- Check on the crabs, Bob.
- Okay.

367
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:05,410
-[Whispers] Is he staying for dinner?
-I don't know.

368
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:09,122
I hope they don't have a fight. You
don't think they'd call it off, do you?

369
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:13,584
Wedding cake freezes. This we know.
[Chuckles]

370
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:18,129
- You know, your daughter is such--
- [Gasps] Oh, I'm sorry.

371
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,798
No, no, that's all right,
Grandma. That's fine.

372
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,842
She's such a lovely girl.

373
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:25,761
Yeah. Well,
like her mother. Look.

374
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,138
May she rest in peace.

375
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,099
We were all so proud of Maggie
when she was in school.

376
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,643
She won that American Legion
scholarship to college.

377
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:36,478
She studied industrial design.

378
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:40,315
I can't see her leaving multiple grooms
in the dust like that.

379
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:43,317
Oh, yes, you can.
She's got it all on tape.

380
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,447
- Tape?
- Yeah, they're all right there.

381
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:50,782
You got tapes of the wedding?

382
00:22:50,824 --> 00:22:52,909
Lee, at the hotel,
videos weddings.

383
00:22:52,992 --> 00:22:58,205
Course Maggie didn't know she was
gonna be running the 100-yarddash.

384
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:01,958
- I gotta say, she makes real good time.
- Bingo!

385
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,668
Maggie may not be
Hale's longest running joke,

386
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,670
but she is certainly the fastest.

387
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:09,506
Ha, ha.

388
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:15,469
Maggie's mom and I
were only blessed with one child,

389
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:17,513
not for a lack of trying.

390
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,598
This is good, Dad.
Don't leave anything out.

and pay for so many weddings.

00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:31,524
Not this one.
This one's on me.

I have no intentions of doing it again.

the P.E. department at the high school.

And he coaches the football team.
And he's climbed Everest.

- Everest? Is it true?
- [Maggie] Twice.

- Oh, how romantic!
- We think so.

[Sniffs]
Mmm. What is that wonderful smell?

455
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:24,312
Oh, the cinnamon rolls!

456
00:28:24,395 --> 00:28:26,730
- Could I have two of those? Thank you.
- Yeah, sure.

457
00:28:26,814 --> 00:28:30,233
Okay. Uh, Maggie,
I think this makes the best you.

458
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,860
[Whispering] Okay.

459
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:36,906
Oh, let's see. Look at that.

460
00:28:36,989 --> 00:28:39,032
Excuse me.

461
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:42,827
Oh, look at that.

462
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:45,580
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

463
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:50,292
Ow, ow, ow!
Help me! Help me!

464
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:53,211
[Sighs]
Yep, that'd be her.

465
00:28:54,837 --> 00:28:57,631
You must be
that Mr. Graham fella.

466
00:28:57,673 --> 00:28:59,800
- Yes, I am! And you are?
- [Laughing]

467
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:02,719
- I'm Betty Trout.
- Hi, Betty!

468
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:06,139
Okay, I guess you'll be
the one making the cake.

469
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,015
Yes, I am. Sure.

470
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:10,934
I'm also told
that you will be throwing--

471
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:13,645
I'm throwing the luau for Maggie.

472
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:16,481
Pre-wedding luau!

473
00:29:16,564 --> 00:29:18,691
If you're still in town,
you should stop by.

474
00:29:18,774 --> 00:29:20,734
No, no, he doesn't want to come.

475
00:29:20,818 --> 00:29:22,861
I'd love to come.
[Bell Rings]

476
00:29:22,944 --> 00:29:25,572
I will be there. Thank you.

477
00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:29,658
Is that what you're going to do now?
Follow me around everywhere I go?

478
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:30,909
No.

479
00:29:30,993 --> 00:29:34,079
I'll be back, Betty.

480
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:37,040
Bye, Mr. Graham.

481
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:39,417
- He's not a nice person.
- Well, I know.

482
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,128
That's my pick.
The eyes are perfect.

483
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:47,465
[Cheerleaders]
We always win. We never fail.

484
00:29:47,548 --> 00:29:51,969
We're the Comets, so go to Hale!
% Let's go, Comets %

485
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:55,722
% Let's go
Let's go, Comets, let's go %

486
00:29:55,805 --> 00:29:58,766
- Hi, Miss Carpenter.
- Hey, Kendall.

487
00:30:00,184 --> 00:30:04,980
Maggie, don't marry Coach.
Marry me. I love you.

488
00:30:05,063 --> 00:30:09,859
You're jail bait, Dennis. Go away.
Go away. Run your laps. Go, go!

489
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,112
[Bob]
Drive, drive, drive! From the hips!

490
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:16,364
Keep it low now, keep it low!

491
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:20,076
[Whistle Blows] Good job, gentlemen.
All right, special teams.

492
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,745
Special teams.

493
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:25,705
- Hey, honey, how are you?
- Good.

494
00:30:25,747 --> 00:30:28,583
What is he up to now?

495
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:30,918
Ike just dropped by
to check out the team.

496
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:32,670
And to talk about you!

497
00:30:32,753 --> 00:30:34,546
- Ahh!
- Yes!

498
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:37,090
You aren't making friends
with this man, are you?

499
00:30:37,132 --> 00:30:40,509
I'm just bragging
about how good you are.

500
00:30:40,593 --> 00:30:44,012
- And how I'm the luckiest man alive.
- Mm-hmm!

501
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,890
Sweetie.

502
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:50,434
Well, I better be moving.

503
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:52,937
Got a lot of work to do today.

504
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:55,397
- See you two lovebirds later.
- See you at the weddin'.

505
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:59,359
- Yeah. Thanks for the jacket.
- You invited him to the wedding?

506
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:03,445
% Go, go, Comets
Let's go %

507
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,739
Don't you realize he's writing
another article about me?

508
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:06,615
Sure.

509
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:12,370
But you're not runnin'. Come on. Give
me some of that homemade sunshine.

510
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:17,165
Boys, take my princess
for a ride on her chariot.

511
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:19,084
Oh, my--
[Laughing]

512
00:31:25,464 --> 00:31:27,716
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

513
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:32,261
My last confession was--
Well, anyway.

514
00:31:32,345 --> 00:31:35,097
I have sort of
a technical question.

515
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,225
I've been having bad thoughts.

516
00:31:38,308 --> 00:31:41,144
Reallybadthoughts.

517
00:31:41,227 --> 00:31:44,105
- Of an impure nature?
- No, no.

518
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:50,068
I want to destroy this man's life,
career, everything. I want revenge!

519
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:53,487
Now, on the sin scale,
howbadis that?

520
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:56,865
Can I... "Hail Mary"
my way out of that?

521
00:31:56,949 --> 00:32:00,493
-My child, any sin in one's heart is a--
-The name is Maggie.

522
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:03,120
It was this side of ten years ago
you had your tongue down my throat.

523
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:06,248
So don't "my child" me, Brian, okay?
It annoys me.

524
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:08,709
Maggie, don't get so upset.

525
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:11,961
Hey, hey! Don't-- Brian, talk to me.
I need to talk to you.

526
00:32:12,045 --> 00:32:13,546
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

527
00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:16,298
You're not even Catholic
so you really shouldn't be here.

528
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:20,343
I'm sorry. I'm just so stressed out
about this slimeball reporter.

529
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:23,346
And I wanted to come and tell you
that he might stop by here...

530
00:32:23,387 --> 00:32:25,723
and ask you all kinds
of ridiculous questions.

531
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:28,767
Well, he only actually asked me
one ridiculous question.

532
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,810
The rest weren't so bad.

533
00:32:30,852 --> 00:32:34,522
What? Oh, you talked to him?

534
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:37,941
Did you tell him
we dated before you were a priest?

535
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:41,528
Of course.
I think I only did you good.

536
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:43,863
W-What exactly did he ask?

537
00:32:43,946 --> 00:32:47,491
- Am I too late, Father?
- No, no.

538
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:51,036
- It won't take long. Just two venials.
- Okay.

539
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:53,580
Um, just respectful things.

540
00:32:53,663 --> 00:32:56,999
What kind of music did you like?
What did we have in common?

541
00:32:57,082 --> 00:33:01,169
Did you ruin my life
when you left me at the altar?

542
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:03,713
Uh, what did you say?

543
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:06,257
I said, you know,
how could I be angry...

544
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:11,344
when this is clearly as God
intended for it to be for me?

545
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:13,805
Good one! Thanks.

546
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:18,767
But, actually,
it's, it's really, really how I feel.

547
00:33:21,436 --> 00:33:22,854
Of course. God, yes.

548
00:33:22,937 --> 00:33:24,939
Not... [Whispers] God.

549
00:33:25,023 --> 00:33:26,482
[Whispers]
Sorry.

550
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:28,776
I better go.
The man is a lunatic.

551
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:31,695
But I think I know exactly
where he's going next.

552
00:33:31,778 --> 00:33:33,697
[Whispering]
God bless.

553
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:37,366
Oh! Purse.

554
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:40,494
Forgot my purse.

555
00:33:40,577 --> 00:33:42,913
Hi, sorry. Purse.

556
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:45,206
Good luck.

557
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,000
What was the one ridiculous question
that he asked?

558
00:33:48,084 --> 00:33:51,170
He wanted to know
how you liked your eggs.

559
00:33:51,253 --> 00:33:53,046
Oh, weird.

560
00:33:53,129 --> 00:33:55,256
Like a person's gonna
remember after all this time.

561
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,301
Scrambled with salt, pepper and dill.
Same as me.

562
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,765
I'm sorry I hurt you, Brian.

563
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:11,562
Maggie, I'm happy now... here.
It's where I'm supposed to be.

564
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:16,024
But... if you ever do decide to become
a Catholic, will you do me this favor?

565
00:34:16,107 --> 00:34:18,025
Confess to Father Patrick.

566
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:20,694
Of course.

567
00:34:35,498 --> 00:34:38,042
- Gill? Lydia?
- Mags!

568
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:40,878
Hey, look, the tape. Remember?

569
00:34:40,961 --> 00:34:42,921
Radio City Music Hall concert...

570
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:45,966
when Jerry was on "Ripple,"
and I'm going like, "Dude, let me jam."

571
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:48,092
- Gill, listen--
- I'll play it for you.

572
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:51,095
- You remember, Maggie. You were there.
- Can you focus on me?

573
00:34:51,178 --> 00:34:53,931
There's this reporter
who's making my life a living hell.

574
00:34:54,014 --> 00:34:55,348
Okay.

575
00:34:55,432 --> 00:34:58,059
And whatever you do,

576
00:34:58,142 --> 00:35:02,062
do not show him that picture of me
from the concert in San Francisco.

577
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:04,189
- Okay? Can you--
- [Ike Laughing]

578
00:35:04,273 --> 00:35:08,651
- What is that?
- Uh-- Wait. San Francisco?

579
00:35:08,735 --> 00:35:11,278
But we went there a few times.
There's a lot of pictures.

580
00:35:11,362 --> 00:35:14,364
Which picture? Because one time
we had a flat tire. Remember?

581
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:16,116
Imagine!

582
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,620
Maggie Carpenter
topless in a public arena.

583
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:24,331
Mmm. Oh, yeah.

584
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:27,625
I see it was
a very chilly evening.

585
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,961
Mm-hmm.

586
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:35,882
What's really interesting
about this, though,

587
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:39,886
is that you can't see
that rose tattoo...

588
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:43,722
- on your back.
- [Chuckles]

589
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:47,475
Oh, yeah. Ike bet me 50 bucks
that you don't still have it.

590
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,895
I said, "You're on, man.
Maggie loved that thing."

591
00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:53,981
And, seriously, I mean,
I could use 50 bucks.

592
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:57,150
- Mm-hmm.
- Maggie?

593
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:59,152
Just--

594
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:05,157
Look, I'm not gonna show
you guys anything.

595
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,994
I am a soon-to-be-married woman.
So just give me the photograph!

596
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:11,079
I would love to give you this.
Believe me, I would.

597
00:36:11,162 --> 00:36:15,040
Just give us a quick gander
at that rose,

598
00:36:15,124 --> 00:36:17,042
and I'll gladly
turn it over to you.

599
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,919
Fine. Fine. Okay, fine.

600
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:24,006
Okay? All right?

601
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,800
- [Clears Throat] Satisfied?
- Completely.

602
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:31,471
- Maggie, you got it removed?
- Gill--

603
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:34,974
Gill, I'll go you double or nothing
it was a stick on.

604
00:36:37,017 --> 00:36:38,935
Maggie?

605
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:45,316
Gill, I am...

606
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:48,193

Look! Look!

610
00:36:56,242 --> 00:36:58,577
I think this man is heartbroken.

- No, he's not.
- I think I am.

No, you're, you're not!

Hey, Ike?

- What would Jerry do?

-Jerry would play!
- He would play!

- Yeah.

He's an attractive man.

629
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:22,522
The vicious reporter is attractive?
You're saying viciousness is attractive?

No, I'm not saying
viciousness is attractive.

No, no, no.
Don't leave. Uh, act natural.

Gimme 15. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well done.

- I will handle this.
- Don't move your lips! Okay? Go on.

Yes, and this must be her beer too.

That your husband out here?

- Yeah.
- This is Cory? Cory Flemming?

646
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:14,649
He's a radio announcer here,
isn't he?

647
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:18,069
Yeah, that's right. Have you heard his
morning show, "Wake up with Flemm"?

648

Not yet.

649
00:39:21,655 --> 00:39:26,076
[Grandma Over P.A.]Now up,
Atlantic Hotel's Lee Mistlehorne.

650
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,202
He actually made
the all-stars in high school.

651
00:39:28,286 --> 00:39:30,538
Really?
You must be proud of him.

652
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,539
I didn't really
know him back then.

653
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:37,460
He was actually dating Maggie...
at the time.

654
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:42,006
I mean, he never really--
They were never gonna...

655
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,925
get engaged or anything,
it was just like, you know.

656
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,927
Sometimes he'd call her Magpie,
and it was really irritating.

657
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,972
But-- I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,515
No, this is good.

Yes! Yes! Whoo!

663

Safe!

664

- Good one!
- Magpie!

Excellent!

It's nice that
they're... still friends.

669
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:36,385
Yeah, I mean, that was just a long time
ago. And, you know, it's just--

670
00:40:38,762 --> 00:40:41,681
So-- Excuse me.

were donated by Betty Trout.

Now up for the Comets,
Jordan Hill.

676
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:03,074
You have been here,
what, like three minutes?

677
00:41:03,157 --> 00:41:04,617
What did you do to her?

678
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:09,121
-You could just turn that finger around.
-Excuse me?

679
00:41:09,204 --> 00:41:12,957
Oh, Cory, Cory, Cory!
Pow, pow, pow, pow. What is this about?

680
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,960
You know what? We have all
been friends our entire lives.

681
00:41:16,043 --> 00:41:18,920
A type of relationship
that you obviously don't understand.

682
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:22,298
I'm not the only one
who does not understand.

683
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:25,968
The U.S.S. Maggie
leaves quite a wake.

684
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,011
Excuse me.

to Lee Mistlehorne to Dr. Ettinger.

687
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:49,154
Hey. All right.

00:41:50,322 --> 00:41:53,074
That's cheering.
I'm cheering normal.

689
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:56,202
Cheer. Normal.

00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,332
- [Woman] Good morning, Peggy.
- Good morning.

691
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:15,009
Do you think I flirt with Cory?

692
00:42:16,677 --> 00:42:20,639
Good morning to you too.
You look good.

693
00:42:20,681 --> 00:42:23,433
Thank you.

694
00:42:23,516 --> 00:42:25,893
Do you think I flirt with Cory?

695
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:29,813
- Yes.
- I don't mean to.

696
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:33,066
I know. I think sometimes
you just sort of...

697
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:36,527
spaz out with excess
flirtatious energy,

698
00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:40,405
and it just lands
on anything male that moves.

699
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:43,241
Anything male that moves?

700
00:42:43,325 --> 00:42:46,744
As opposed to anything male
that doesn't?

701
00:42:48,245 --> 00:42:51,748
Well, like certain kinds of coral.

702
00:42:52,749 --> 00:42:55,543
I'm definitely going to have
to kill myself today.

703
00:42:55,585 --> 00:42:56,586
Why?

704
00:42:56,669 --> 00:43:00,714
Because you think I'm all like,
"Hey, man, check me out."

705
00:43:00,798 --> 00:43:05,343
No, I don't.
I think you're like...

706
00:43:05,426 --> 00:43:09,388
"I'm charming and mysterious
in a way that even I don't understand,

707
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:15,143
and something about me is crying out
for protection from a big man like you."

708
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:17,270
It's very hard to compete with.

709
00:43:17,353 --> 00:43:21,023
Especially as... married women
who've lost our mystery.

710
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:25,276
Lost-- You have--
You are totally mysterious.

711
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,403
No. I'm weird.

712
00:43:27,487 --> 00:43:31,240
Weird and mysterious
are two very different things.

713
00:43:31,323 --> 00:43:34,743
- I'm weird.
- No, you're quirky.

714
00:43:34,784 --> 00:43:39,580
Quirky and weird
are two very different things.

715
00:43:41,582 --> 00:43:45,877
Peggy, I think there
is a distinct possibility...

716
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:50,381
that I am profoundly
and irreversibly screwed up.

717
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:54,051
Despite that,

718
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:57,512
I love you and I promise...

719
00:43:57,595 --> 00:43:59,931
to no longer flirt with Cory.

720
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,768
Maggie, I'm not worried
about you and Cory,

721
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,312
or me and Cory,

722
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:11,190
or you being
irreversibly screwed up.

723
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,568
Maggie, you've been like this
since we were kids.

724
00:44:14,651 --> 00:44:19,072
And all I'm thinking is,
now that you're aware of it,

725
00:44:19,155 --> 00:44:21,449
and that it hurts
people's feelings sometimes,

726
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:26,411
maybe it's time to get on with life,
and commit to someone of your own,

727
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,247
like Bob, if he's the one.

728
00:44:30,373 --> 00:44:32,291
I know.

729
00:44:35,836 --> 00:44:39,589
Is there anything I can do to...
make it up to you?

730
00:44:39,672 --> 00:44:43,425
Well, there's always...

731
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:47,304
the thing that brings
warmth to my heart,

732

and that is duckbill platypus.

733

Duckbill-- That is only funny
in like Camp Birchwood on...

Just do it.

00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:57,812
a trip with the tent and my leg
as the pole and it's raining.

That's the only time that's funny.

[Fisher Over Cell Phone]
My theory is she's running...

756
00:46:26,178 --> 00:46:28,180
because she gets negative attention.

757
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:30,223
Negative attention is attention.

You know, like when women whack you
on the street because of your column.

That's negative attention.

Maybe with a little in the back.

And, my favorite feature...

Ike, Maggie is the sweetest person
you're ever gonna meet.

940
00:57:43,705 --> 00:57:45,791
But she focuses too much out there.

941
00:57:45,874 --> 00:57:48,334
She needs to start
focusing more in here.

I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to try to explain.

00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:42,421
There are reasons why there have been
three weddings and no "I do's."

Right. Netta,

It's not that she's afraid
of the wedding.

- She's afraid of the wedding night!
- Mmm.

Innocent girls are terrified
of the one-eyed snake.

1677
01:42:51,353 --> 01:42:56,524
about why I run,

1678
01:42:56,608 --> 01:42:59,861
sometimes ride, away from things.

1679
01:43:02,655 --> 01:43:05,324
- Does it matter?
- I think so.

1680
01:43:05,407 --> 01:43:07,325
[Clears Throat]

1681
01:43:07,409 --> 01:43:12,580
When I was walking down the aisle,
I was walking toward somebody...

1682
01:43:12,663 --> 01:43:18,376
who had no idea who I really was.

1683
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:23,297
And it was only half
the other person's fault...

1684
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:28,134
because I had done everything
to convince him...

1685
01:43:28,218 --> 01:43:30,303
that I was exactly what he wanted.

1686
01:43:30,386 --> 01:43:33,847
So, it was good...

1687
01:43:33,931 --> 01:43:38,727
that I didn't go through with it
because it would've been a lie.

1688
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:42,521
But you--

1689
01:43:42,605 --> 01:43:45,065
You knew the real me.

1690
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:49,027
Yes, I did.

1691
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:51,612
I didn't.

1692
01:43:52,989 --> 01:43:57,242
Still, I ended up
chasing a truck.

1693
01:44:10,962 --> 01:44:14,882
I can't, um,
do anything about the truck.

1694
01:44:16,842 --> 01:44:18,760
But, uh--

1695
01:44:23,222 --> 01:44:25,933
- Benedict.
- Arnold.

1696
01:44:26,016 --> 01:44:28,602
I love eggs Benedict.

1697
01:44:28,685 --> 01:44:31,437
I hate all the other
kinds of eggs.

1698
01:44:31,479 --> 01:44:35,691
I hate big weddings,
everybody staring.

1699
01:44:35,774 --> 01:44:38,777
I'd like to get married on
a weekday while everybody's at work.

1700
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:42,447
And if I ride off into the sunset,
I want my own horse.

1701
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:44,991
- Should I be writing this down?
- And there's something else.

1702
01:44:45,074 --> 01:44:47,576
No, you can tell me.
Don't--

1703
01:44:47,659 --> 01:44:49,578
Okay.

1704
01:44:54,582 --> 01:44:56,542
These are for you.

1705
01:45:01,921 --> 01:45:04,924
- Used--
- Well, they're mine.

1706
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:09,970
I'm turning in
my running shoes to you.

1707
01:45:13,223 --> 01:45:15,141
This is serious.

1708
01:45:15,224 --> 01:45:16,892
And there's one more thing.

1709
01:45:16,976 --> 01:45:19,853
I know, the mind reels that
there could be more after this.

1710
01:45:19,937 --> 01:45:23,940
-But, um, if you could just have a seat.
-[Clears Throat]

1711
01:45:27,276 --> 01:45:30,612
Let's just not have that there.

1712
01:45:30,696 --> 01:45:33,406
Okay. Okay.

1713
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:42,205
- Oh, no. My, God, no.
- No, no. Don't hide your face.

1714
01:45:42,289 --> 01:45:45,291
This happens once in a lifetime,
and it's definitely a first for me.

1715
01:45:45,375 --> 01:45:48,460
You're not gonna want to miss it,
so pay close attention.

1716
01:45:55,216 --> 01:45:59,803
I love you,
Homer Eisenhower Graham.

1717
01:46:02,472 --> 01:46:03,765
Will you marry me?

1718
01:46:03,765 --> 01:46:05,433
Will you marry me?

1719
01:46:11,813 --> 01:46:13,732
[Laughs]

1720
01:46:15,275 --> 01:46:18,486
I gotta think about this
a little bit.

1721
01:46:18,569 --> 01:46:22,656
- Good. I was hoping you would say that.
- You were not! Not true.

1722
01:46:22,739 --> 01:46:25,658
If you'd said yes, I wouldn't
be able to do this next part...

1723
01:46:25,742 --> 01:46:27,577
and I've been practicing so let me--

1724
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:31,622
Okay.
[Exhales]

1725
01:46:31,705 --> 01:46:34,416
- Ready?
- I'm listening.

[Sighs]

1727
01:46:42,256 --> 01:46:47,051
I guarantee
that we'll have tough times.

1728
01:46:47,093 --> 01:46:50,221
And I guarantee
that at some point...

1729
01:46:50,304 --> 01:46:53,765
one or both of us
will want to get out.

1730
01:46:55,183 --> 01:46:58,019
But I also guarantee...

1731
01:46:58,102 --> 01:47:01,564
that if I don't ask you to be mine,

1732
01:47:01,647 --> 01:47:04,232
I'll regret it
for the rest of my life.

1733
01:47:05,483 --> 01:47:07,944
'Cause I know in my heart...

1734
01:47:07,986 --> 01:47:11,280
you're the only one for me.

1735
01:47:18,328 --> 01:47:20,955
That's a pretty
good speech, Maggie.

1736

I borrowed it from
this writer I know.

1737
01:47:26,876 --> 01:47:29,545
So?

[Pastor] We are gathered here
today to celebrate the union...

1741
01:48:24,508 --> 01:48:27,844
of Maggie Carpenter and Ike Graham.

- Do you have the rings?
- Yes.

1743

Do you, Ike, take Maggie
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1744

I do.

1745
01:48:51,823 --> 01:48:56,201
Do you, Maggie, take Ike
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

1746
01:48:56,243 --> 01:48:58,203
I do.

In this life that you share together,

01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:05,000
may your individuality
strengthen your love.

1749

With the power vested in me,

1750

I now pronounce you
husband and wife.
