841
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,052
and smells like bacon?

842
00:59:58,136 --> 00:59:59,804

843
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,684

847
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,335
Figure what out, dear?

848
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:35,881
What's green and slimy
and smells like bacon?

849
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:39,677
I don't know. Uh...

850
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,887
Would you do me a favor, please?

851
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,014
Yeah.

852
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:45,016
Could you hand me that old container

853
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,184
on top of the cabinet?

854
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,145

855
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,855
Yeah. Thank you.

(CLEARING THROAT)

I used to have this snake. Big fucker.

911
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:51,035
I used to have to feed him.

912
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,078
Once a week, I'd give him a live mouse.

-Hmm.
-Yeah.

914

Huh. Well, anyway, this one ate mice.

917
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:09,470
And there was this one time

918
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,764
I dropped a mouse in his cage,

919
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,934
and he got a whiff of it, so he went for him,

920
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,103
and this mouse

921
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:21,524
got up on his hind legs

922
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:23,025
and punched him in the face.

-You're kidding.
-Mmm-mmm.

924

Got a little fucked up.

928
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:36,497
Went off in the corner and cried.

929
01:04:37,249 --> 01:04:38,874
And that fucking mouse ruled the cage.

930
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,335
Went on for weeks. He just, like,

931
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,004
walked around like he owned the joint.

932

I mean, like, defiant.

935
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,559
Yeah. I tried to feed him other mice, too.

936
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,519
But I'd drop the new mouse into the cage,

937
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,896
and he'd just hide behind the old mouse.

938
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:03,482
The snake's scared shitless.

939
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,860
He died. Starved to death.

so you can still hate me anyway, but...

1170

I just thought I'd come say that.

1171
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:49,156
And now I said it.

to mourn the loss and commemorate the life

1184

of Madeleine Frances Forney.

1185

she treated me as if I was one of the family.

Now, she's been trying
to tell you guys something,

but you're too fucked up to listen,

so if you'll just shut up for a second,

Then you'll never see me again.

I pulled this gas tank from an old Chevy.

1224
01:34:03,555 --> 01:34:05,931
I wanted to blow it up, so I did.

1225
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:09,184
What I didn't think about was all the,

that were gonna fly in every direction.

01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:13,188
And I almost killed myself.

1228
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:15,441
I woke up in this hospital.

1229
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:18,027
And this doctor was like, "Son."

1230
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:19,486
And I said, "Don't call me son,
you fucking cunt."

1231
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:22,573
And then, he was, like,
"You blew off your nut."

I just lost my nut like that.

I assaulted a nurse
or a doctor, I don't remember,

1235
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:35,336
but I got arrested, I went to juvie.

1236
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,338

was my fucking nut, man.

I had to go looking for it, right?

1240
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:45,429
So I busted out of juvie and I went searching,

1241
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,597
couldn't find my nut.

and staring at this little piece of flabby sack

where my left nut used to be.

And then, I saw my right nut for the first time.

"Look, I have... I still have a nut."
