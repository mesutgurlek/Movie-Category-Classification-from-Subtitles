So they want to bring in
some tits and ass, huh?

57

Isn't that why you hired her
in the first place?

and they just keep coming.

63

Don't tell me, your novel?

-No.
-Oh!

-Not yet. Not yet.

that they paid you?

Let me guess here,
Vanessa is the editor's wife?

Was.

she used to tear hair out in clumps,
right out of her head, yeah.

She said that we're not her parents,

isn't married yet?"

-Jeff is gay.

Well, yeah. I mean,

633
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:24,969
better that the guy lives a lie than he
inconvenience the family. I mean...

you got Blair a subscription to

Mmm-hmm.

And before that, you signed him up
to an Al Qaeda website.

The man still can't fly out of the country.

I've upset Claire, is that it?

No, you've upset Mom.

654

to say anything.

-They're married. Stick to the facts.

-Oh, for Christ's sake, apologise to who?

-Actually, I have a date.
-Oh.

-Nice boy?
-No. He's a nasty piece of work.

-Funny. (CHUCKLING)
-Yes, he's very nice.

We'll see. It's our third date and
I'm not bored silly or madly in love.

00:44:39,614 --> 00:44:42,947
I like him.
I think that shows a sign of maturity.

with how inappropriate this all is.

-No.
-So what happened?

784

I'm in love with someone else.

786
00:53:25,473 --> 00:53:27,259
You don't know her.

787
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:28,973
Where'd you meet her?

788
00:53:30,436 --> 00:53:33,098
-You don't want to know that.
-Wait a minute.

789
00:53:33,189 --> 00:53:36,477
You asked me here to talk
and now you don't want to talk?

-I don't know.

-Some paternal wisdom. How about that?
-Ah. Fine.

793

who knows how hard marriage can be.

all she wants to do is talk.

through a cheese grater.

This is the paternal wisdom I'm gonna get?

804
00:54:15,314 --> 00:54:18,647
Maybe you should just take a step back
before you do something rash

805
00:54:18,734 --> 00:54:20,520
and take a good hard look at the situation.

806
00:54:21,195 --> 00:54:25,438
You're married to a well-bred woman
who is loaded.

Makes a nice, flaky k ugel,
has a beautiful rack.

808
00:54:29,662 --> 00:54:32,244
And many successful marriages have
been built on far less.

-Mmm.

811

If you divorce her, she's going to
take you to the cleaners.

812
00:54:42,758 --> 00:54:44,919
Oh, come on. Her father is loaded.

813

She's going to inherit a shitload
of money. She's going to be fine.

from taking all of yours?

Is she the mother of your children?

I am not your pet project.

939
01:03:36,249 --> 01:03:38,410
I am not your vicarious life.

940
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:40,201
You're not my friend?

941
01:03:40,295 --> 01:03:41,330
(EXCLAIMS)

942
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:43,332
Hey! Do you realise something?

943
01:03:43,423 --> 01:03:45,459
Do you realise
that you haven't even come close

944
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:48,587
-to giving me a goddamn apology?
-You know what?

945
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:53,139
Let me recommend another book for you
to stock your shelf with there, Barney.

946
01:03:53,225 --> 01:03:55,591
The Life of Heinrich Heine,

947
01:03:55,686 --> 01:03:58,393
who, upon his deathbed,
was begged by his loved ones

948
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:01,142
to ask for God's forgiveness
before he passed.

949
01:04:01,233 --> 01:04:06,273
But good old Heinrich, he had only this
to say, "God will surely forgive me.

950
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:09,980
"After all it's his fucking job."
