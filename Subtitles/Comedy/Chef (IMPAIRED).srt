00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,885
You walk here?

3
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,643
Alright, good. Turn around.

4
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,810

The bag.

6
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,844
Gotta still hit
the farmers' market.

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,331
- What time is it?
- 10:00-ish.

8
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,811
- It's 10:00?
- Mm-hm.

9
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,042
I gotta pick up the kid.
Where's Tony?

10
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,204
Tony and I were out late last night.
But don't worry, he's gonna be here.

11
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,691
- You got this?
- Yes.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,330
He's not gonna flake.
Neither am I.

13
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,249
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

14
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,925
- Yes, Chef.
- Wake up.

15
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,445
We got a critic coming today.

16
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,284
Why you think
I slept here for, bro?

17
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,721
Let's get going on the soup.
We're behind on the egg prep.

18
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,683
And get the mise on the steak.
You still shitfaced?

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,480
- No, I'm good. I'm good, Chef.
- Alright.

20
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:06,289

We got the pig.

- Hey, pal.
- Hey.

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,248
Buckle up, buddy.
Sorry I'm late.

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,925
I'm used to it.

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,560
Listen, pal, I don't think we have time
to catch a movie today.

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,529
Is it 'cause
you're getting reviewed?

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,206
- Yeah, how'd you know about that?
- Mom told me.

29
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,771
What'd she say?

30
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,843
She said you might be
a little worried.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,764
- She said I was worried?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,207
Well, Mom doesn't know me
that well, OK?

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,567
- She's pretty spot-on about you.
- Oh, yeah?

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
You know what Mommy thinks
I should be doing?

35
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,005
- What?
- That I should get a food truck.

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
- I like food trucks.
- Yeah, I like food trucks.

37
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:45,331
Who doesn't like food trucks?

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,562
Can you picture me
driving a food truck? I'm a chef.

39
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,688
- I work in a restaurant.
- OK.

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,520
Listen, I gotta go to the farmers' market,
pick up some ingredients.

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,847
OK. Can I come?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,760
I thought I'd drop you off
at the restaurant.

43
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,285
- Molly's there.
- No, I wanna go with you.

44
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,204
- You're not gonna ask me
for everything you see? -No.

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,641
It's not about you eating,
it's about me buying groceries.

46
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,665
- I know.
- OK. Good.

47
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,165
- You got the purple and white?
- Just orange.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,004
Just orange?
Alright, give me six bunches of those.

49
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,491
- Or eight of the small.
- Dad.

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,530
Hang on a second, buddy. And on the
radishes here, I use the tops, OK?

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,011
- I need consistent tops.
- Dad.

52
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,401
Is that what's happening?
Six of these. Let's see what we got.

53
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,891
- Dad.
- What do you want, Percy?

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
- Can I please have kettle corn?
- Daddy's working, OK?

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,571
No, you're not
gonna get kettle...

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
- Why don't you get a piece of fruit?
- I don't want fruit.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,566
How can you even ask for kettle corn?
You know what it is?

58
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,087
- No.
- It's carbs covered with sugar, OK?

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,765
Look at this piece of fruit.

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,410
Huh? It's beautiful.

61
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,920
How could you
even want kettle corn

62
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,840
with gorgeous fruit like this
in front of you?

63
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,370
Why don't you have
a piece of fruit?

64
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,285
So apparently they're sending
a big reviewer

65
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,169
who's also some
huge food blogger.

66
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,243
- You know what a food blogger is?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,607
A guy who writes about food
on the internet.

68
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,250
I know what a food blogger is.

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,643
Well, this guy's a big one,
and a lot of these big guys,

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,131
they don't like me.

71
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,170
They got it in for me because I got
good write-ups when I started out.

72
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,085
- They're haters.
- Exactly.

73
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,083
We didn't have that word
when I was growing up.

74
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,571
There was no word for hater.

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,802
The most you would say
is that somebody was, like, jealous,

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,291
which didn't really capture it.

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,600
The sausage guy's here.
You ever try andouille sausage?

78
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,971
- No.
- It's spicy.

79
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,406
- You like spicy?
- No.

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,005
It's not so spicy. Come on.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,606
That's from New Orleans.
You ever heard of New Orleans?

82
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,091
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

83
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,571
It's part of the United States.

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,200
It's part of the Louisiana Purchase
from Napoleon.

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,725
Yeah. Um, that was...

86
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,531
I mean, like, now.
That was a long time ago.

87
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,081
- 1803.
- Whatever.

88
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,164
Talking about the food,
the culture, you know?

89
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,527
Like this andouille sausage.

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,081
- Beignets. You ever hear of that?
- We can get it here.

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,571
Not the same.

92
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,040
When you have it here, it's good
because it reminds you of,

93
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,885
like, a whole world of memories
that you have of being there.

94
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,840
'Cause it's like... I'm telling you,
it's like a whole different world.

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,843
- We should go there sometime.
- Definitely.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,764
- For real?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,445
I mean, not now.

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,931
- But, like...
- When?

99
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,367
I don't know. I got...
Everything's very full for me.

100
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,801
- I got this reviewer coming.
- After the review?

101
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,042
Yeah, after review.
That'd be good.

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,690
I'm off school next month.

103
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,808
Next month? Yeah.
We could go next month.

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,291
- Awesome.
- Or whatever. Or, like, if you're...

105
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,771
If it doesn't... I'll ask Mom.

106
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,880
If it doesn't work out next month,
we'll go later.

107
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,800
- But we'll definitely check it out.
- I already did. She's cool with it.

108
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,441
- You asked her already?
- Mm-hm.

109
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,920
Where'd you get a phone?
How come you have a phone already?

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,365
Everybody your age have phones?

111
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,329
TONY: Yo, Popeye,
get the sauce on there, OK?

112
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,324
Whose bacon is this, huh?
I gotta watch this too?

113
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,400
When I find out who it is, grab your
ankles, 'cause here comes papi chulo.

114
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,807
Where we at? Talk to me, people.
How we doing?

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,803
The stock's simmering,
the pig's broken down, bacon are fine.

116
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,680
The stock is simmering.
That means reducing.

117
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,644
Good. Guys, big night tonight.
You all know what's happening?

118
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,643
Yeah? OK, let me know
as soon as he's here.

119
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,760
I want people having fun
at all the tables around.

120
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,451
Call your pretty friends, bring 'em in.
Tell 'em the tickets are on me.

121
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,045
The stemware looks crooked.
Let's get out there.

122
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,043
Don't make me get
the fucking ruler out. Thank you.

123
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,531
- Oh, Chef.
- I got the good shit.

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,523
- You see this, Martin?
- Look at that. That's a specimen.

125
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,364
- Baby carrots.
- MAN: I got you curry paste with...

126
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,124
- MARTIN: Copy that. Copy that.
- Carl.

127
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,611
Not right now, please.

128
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,800
Where the fuck did you get
these juicy-ass tomatoes?

129
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:00,667
- Riva's here.
- OK, you got it? Let's get...

130
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,011
What the hell's Riva doing here?

131
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,003
I don't know.
He was on his way back here.

132
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,200
I got him espresso,
bought you five minutes of time.

133
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,765
You should meet him
out on the floor.

134
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,400
Stall him for five minutes.
Let me get the staff going. Please.

135
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:13,402
OK. Fine.
Expect him to come back here.

136
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,891
CARL: Yeah, thank you.

137
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,883
How you gonna keep that psychopath
from coming back here?

138
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,200
- You gotta have a plan.
- You want me to pickle these?

139
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
Yeah, pickle these.
I want you to pickle...

140
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:22,211
- ls Carl in there?
- Yeah.

141
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,488
- Hey, Carl!
- (OTHERS TALK SIMULTANEOUSLY)

142
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,324
Carl.

143
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,041
Are you, uh... are you planning
on altering the menu?

144
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,080
Yeah, I can't do this right now.
Please, just...

145
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,242
- You know a lot is on the line today.
- I know.

146
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,880
That's why the menu
has to be perfect.

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,446
- But I can help you plan it.
- I can't do this right now.

148
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,240
Give me five minutes with my staff,
I'll walk you through the menu.

149
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,119
I've done this before.
I can help guide you.

150
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,611
I don't need guidance right now.
I need space.

151
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,965
OK?

152

Are you talking about my sweetbreads?
Is that what you mean?

Yeah. When you put that artsy shit
on the menu, people don't like it.

- Right.

You know why you get it?

Because you deserve it.

See, you don't know that.
But I know it.

196

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,401
No, not just, like, watching something
or doing something.

458
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,608
Like, hanging out and talking.

459
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,330
And learning things
from each other.

with you living at Mom's house

00:22:24,504 --> 00:22:27,529
and me working all the time, when we
hung out, you liked to do fun things.

462
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,524
I think this is kinda fun.
You know, just figuring stuff out.

463
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,330
Like when you lived at home.

464
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,290
Yeah, I miss that too.

465
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,890
Then why don't you
move back home?

Percy, I can't just...

467
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,200
You're not the reason that I'm not
living at home. You know that, right?

468
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,725
- Mm-hm.
- 'Cause it's true.

- Then why what?

Well, why don't you live home?

Well, Mommy and Daddy, you know,

we... we both grew apart,
in different directions.

But we're still
really good friends.

- No.

Yeah, I just sent

tweet any pictures of my dick

- A tasting menu for Ramsey Michel.

- I did.

- It's all over the internet.

598
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,163

- Taste the food.

599
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,200
Bring in the waitstaff,
have 'em taste the food.

600
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,960
Make them understand
what we're going for.

601
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:16,984
- OK.
- OK?

602
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,440
We're not pushing specials today.
The whole menu is special.

the same menu, right?

607
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,885
I have something really good
planned for tonight.

608
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,371
I'm gonna let you...
It's not sweetbreads.

609
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,522
- You're gonna be able to taste it.
- That may be true.

610
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,126
But we have the most reservations
on a work night since we opened.

611
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,120
- You realise that?
- I know. I was on Twitter.

612
00:30:37,144 --> 00:30:38,804
- Yeah.
- I was promoting the restaurant.

613
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,120
- I was on Twitter.
- What? Yeah, that's another thing.

614
00:30:41,144 --> 00:30:44,527
From now on, before you
post anything online, I OK it. Alright?

615
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,011
The whole reason
everybody's here tonight

616
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,605
is because I called out
Ramsey Michel online

617
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,001
and they're all coming
to watch me stick it in his ass.

618
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,844
Yeah, and you're gonna twitter
an apology

619
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,243
for calling the most respected critic
in Los Angeles an asshole.

620

- I'm not gonna fucking apologise.
- What do you mean, you're not...

621

- You see what he wrote about me?
- I don't give a fuck...

- He started it!
- ..what he wrote. I don't care.

You're a cook. You're a chef.

This is what you've been cooking
for years, and it works.

625
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,649
And either you cook the menu
that our customers have come to ex...

626

- You want me to cook the same food?
- The same exact...

627

The same food that he ripped apart?
The same guy who's coming tonight?

628
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,880
The restaurant
isn't filled with critics!

that've been eating your food

you're gonna be an artist.

632

Well, be an artist
on your own time.

- No calves' brains.

Listen to me.

636
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:30,888
The kitchen is my domain.
That was our deal.

637

I don't give a fuck
what the deal was!

Don't you have relationships?

755
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,120
Isn't that what you're hired to do?
To take these things off the internet?

756
00:39:36,144 --> 00:39:37,251
But it's out there.

757
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,051
Even if I could persuade one site
to pull down one clip,

758
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,884
there are a dozen others
from other cell phones.

759
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,840
What should we...
should we at least lawyer up

760
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,490
and threaten legal action
or something?

761
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
You threatening them with lawyers
builds on a story

762
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,200
that's already getting
a lot of play.

763
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,920
And then you get another week
of headlines.

764
00:39:50,944 --> 00:39:53,924
And then you got this food critic
posting fresh blogs about you nonstop.

765
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,242
And they're all getting picked up,
and the picked-up headlines

766
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,811
are getting picked up
by each other.

767
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,530
You know,
it's absolutely unbelievable.

768
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,966
- So...
- I've never seen anything like...

769
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,963
Wait a second - you're saying
there's nothing I could do?

770
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,168
To get the footage down?
No, that lives forever.

771
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,651
Great. Awesome.

772
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,087
But there just might be
an opportunity here.

773
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,208
How can this possibly be
an opportunity?

774
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,408
Well, I was holding off
until we spoke,

775
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,643
but I'm fairly certain we have
a good shot at 'Hell's Kitchen'.

776
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,928
- Wait, what?
- The reality show.

777
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,040
I don't think you understand
what's going on here.

778
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,690
I'm a real chef with...

779
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,683
- You said you needed money, right?
- A job.

780
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,161
A job, not money.
I need a job, like I had.

781
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,290
Well, your Twitter account says
you've got 20,000 followers.

782
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,363
- That's pretty damn big.
- Yeah, I'm gonna cancel the account.

783
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,851
- Don't worry.
- Don't cancel it!

784
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,843
I can get you money
to mention a few products.

785
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,480
Are you listening? I don't wanna
get involved with any of that.

786
00:40:38,504 --> 00:40:40,249
- I wanna cook food.
- You got two choices.

787
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,971
You can either lean into it
and work it for all it's worth...

788
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,690
Like Honey Boo Boo.
I don't want that.

789
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,720
You know how much she pulls down?
Or her mother?

790
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,640
I don't care what she makes.
Get to your point.

791
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,481
Or go underground and wait till
the storm passes. You got two choices.

792
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,170
I thought this shit
lives forever online.

793
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,290
It does, but there's so much news
out there and it's so fast

794
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,283
and there's so much white noise,
nobody remembers anything.

795
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,330
OK, thank you for taking the time
and walking me through everything.

796
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,811
It was very illuminating.

797
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,530
Oh, you're hanging up?
OK, listen.

798
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,444
I want you to call any time.
I'm right here.

799
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,410
If you can't get me,
I'm on a cell phone and I've got a pager.

800
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,760
- OK. Thank you, and thank Inez for me.
- No, thank you.

801
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,245
- And what about 'Hell's Kitchen'?
- What about it?

802
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,051
- You still want me to pursue it, right?
- No, I don't want you to.

803
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,920
- OK, I won't call 'em, but I'll email.
- Are you not listening to...

804
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:20,962
I'm gonna go, OK?
I got a call coming in.

805
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,441
OK. Alright. I'll tell you
how 'Hell's Kitchen' goes.

806
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,771
- Fucking idiot.
- (PHONE BEEPS)

807
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,490
Oh, man.

808
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,851
- Hey, Inez.
- INEZ: Hi.

809
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,844
- Did you talk to Jen?
- Yeah, I just got off with her.

810
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,004
- And?
- And, uh, you know, it's terrible.

811
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,891
What do you want me to tell you?
I just wanna cook.

812
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,929
Everything is going to work out.

813
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,720
Half-a-dozen places tried to poach me
when I was back at Gauloises.

814
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,920
I'm trying to line up some interviews
for next week.

815
00:41:46,944 --> 00:41:48,688
That's good.

816
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,730
Yeah, so, listen,
until this whole job thing works out,

817
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,167
could you keep Percy for me?

818
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,563
But you're still taking him with you
to New Orleans, right?

819
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,370
Is he there?

820
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,291
I'll tell him.

821
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,408
Ah, let me... let me talk to him.

822
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,050
Put him on.

823
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,688
Hey, Dad. I understand
if we can't go to New Orleans.

824
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,127
CARL: Oh, man,
thank you so much for saying that.

825
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,648
Just Daddy's so busy with work
right now. You're the best.

826
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,609
Maybe some other time.

827
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,843
Yes, we will, for sure.
Thank you.

828
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,768
'Bye. (HANGS UP)

829
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,244
- (GROOVY MUSIC)
- (PEOPLE CHATTER)

830
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,329
Oh, jefecito.

831
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,245
What's up, man?
Look, everybody. Jefe's here.

832
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,289
Come on, give me some drinks.
Something premium.

833
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,283
Ketel One for the man.

834
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,044
Oh, dude.
Oh, you're everywhere.

835
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,531
- You saw it?
- Ohh!

836
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,445
- It's bad. How bad is it?
- You saw it? You saw it?

837
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,931
- I saw it. It's everywhere.
- It's terrible.

838
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,840
- Is it bad?
- You're never gonna work again.

839
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,530
- (LAUGHS)
- I am, though.

840
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,480
No, seriously, there are people...
there are people who are calling me.

841
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,563
- Dude. Oh, great. I'm glad to hear that.
- Yes. Yes.

842
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,640
I knew you would have
something bigger than this.

843
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,600
- You don't care about coming back here.
- Yeah.

844
00:43:16,624 --> 00:43:18,966
So you came back to tell me
you got me a gig?

845
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,451
'Cause I'll leave Gauloises
like that, baby.

846
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,080
No. Trust me, the first phone call
as soon as something becomes real.

847
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,685
- Don't leave me behind again.
- I will not.

848
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,285
- Don't ever do that again.
- Don't hit me.

849
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,885
- This guy.
- Please don't hit me. I'm sorry.

850
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,804
I'm really sorry.
I was on the spot, bro.

851
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,611
I had been drinking that day.
I... l... l didn't know what to do.

852
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,603
- I'm a pussy, basically. I'm sorry.
- It's OK. It's over.

853
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,920
- I vouch for that.
- It's fine. What are you gonna do?

854
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,082
- It's a big opport...
- But then they put you on YouTube.

855
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,810
And I felt so responsible
for that shit.

856
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,360
- That shit was funny, by the way.
- What was funny about it?

857
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:45,891
- It's not funny for me.
- Just that everybody I know saw it.

858
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,771
- I know, I know.
- I kinda felt famous by knowing you.

859
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,131
Is it a little bit funny? Like... Like, is
it... they're laughing at me or with me?

860
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,169
A little bit of both.

861
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,846
They're laughing with you
and at you at the same time.

862
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,401
- It's so embarrassing.
- Oh, it is terrible. It is so bad.

863
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,005
But it's funny too
at the same time.

864
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,003
It makes you kind of likeable
in a weird way.

865
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,164
Yeah. That guy deserved it.
Everybody knows that guy deserved it.

866
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,084
- But, seriously, I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

867
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,685
You know,
I'm gonna land on my feet.

868
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,126
- Oh, you will.
- Yeah, good. I know.

869
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,200
<i>- I'll</i> get my next gig.
<i>- I'll</i> be there with you.

870
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,049
- Everything will be fine.
- I'm your sous-chef now and forever.

871
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,441
You're not my sous-chef anymore.
You are chef de cuisine.

872
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,720
- But I wouldn't even be there...
- It doesn't matter.

873
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:23,090
Riva's right about one thing.

874
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,720
You are ready to run your own kitchen.
So don't blow it.

875
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,211
It's a big opportunity for you.

876
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,760
- To Tony's big new opportunity.
- To Tony's big opportunity.

877
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,007
- To chef de cuisine.
- I don't like how it happened.

878
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,562
- But I'm happy it happened. OK?
- (CHUCKLES) Two words, man.

879
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,848
You guys.
I love you fucking guys.

880
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,289
- I love you, Tony. I love you.
- Thanks, Chef.

881
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,851
- Look at that.
- Mmm.

882
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,684
I love both of you.

883
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,171
We love you, man.

884
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,800
Let's have a three-way right here.
Come on. Come on. (LAUGHS)

885
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,440
- Hang on, hang on.
- I love you, man.

886
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,400
- I'm glad you made up with him.
- Thanks. Did you take the garbage out?

887
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:57,323
(SIGHS) The truth of the matter is
nobody's calling me.

888
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,289
I got no job prospects
whatsoever.

889
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,800
- What about those offers you got?
- No. It's all dried out.

890
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,360
- Why, from the online shit?
- It must be from the online thing.

891
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:06,971
- Come on.
- I'm like a fucking cat playing a piano.

892
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,485
I don't even know
what that means.

893
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,165
I'm everywhere.

894
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,005
- OK? Like, I'm, like... I'm, like, a meme.
- (CHUCKLES)

895
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,527
Know what a meme is?
I'm a meme. I'm a fucking meme.

896
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,569
Carl, you need to take a break.

897
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,927
I've been on a break.
I've had too much of a break.

898
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,923
- No, you need a real break.
- I need to work.

899
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,162
- I need to get back into a kitchen.
- You don't. Carl...

900
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,960
I wish I never... I should've cooked
the shit he wanted me to cook.

901
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,686
You gonna go work for another Riva
in some other restaurant?

902
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,401
You've been miserable here
as long as I've known you, Carl.

903
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,040
- That's not true. We've had a blast.
- Yes, we've had a blast.

904
00:45:36,064 --> 00:45:37,907
And now it's time for you to go.

905
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,880
You don't belong here anymore.
You know it. Come on.

906
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,490
What's th... Who's this girl?

907
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,369
- Carl.
- (CHUCKLES) What?

908
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,047
- Be real with me.
- I am.

909
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,120
You've been ignoring
a lot of things in your life

910
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,009
that need your attention,
like Percy.

911
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,765
I'm not dad material right now,
if you hadn't noticed.

912
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,968
I'm embarrassing.

913
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,202
He sees all this shit
on the computer.

914
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,522
- Well...
- His friends have...

915
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,331
Maybe it's important for you
to talk to him about it, then.

916
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,290
- I just...
- He needs you, Carl.

917
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,444
I'm... I don't know him, OK?
He's at a weird age.

918
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,921
Why don't you take this time
to get to know him?

919
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,689
I want you to be happy.

920
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,970
You're not happy.

921
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,610
You're never
gonna be happy here.

922
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,210
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

923
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,560
I've never not known
what I was gonna do. I've always known.

924
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,200
There's always been
the next thing to do.

925
00:46:42,224 --> 00:46:45,727
And now that it's all ended,
and I'm, like... I'm, like, fucking lost.

926
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,121
I think that's
a good place to start.

927
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,770
Come here.

928
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,049
- You're the best.
- Yeah.

929

930
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,245
Thank you.

931
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,124
Hi, Flora. Percy here?

932
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,964
Percy aqui?

933
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,849
- He's inside.
- Can you tell him I'm here?

934
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,331
- Sure.
- Thanks.

935

- Why are you here?

936
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,242
I'm here to see...
here to see Percy.

937
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,731
- Oh.
- It's been a while.

938
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,800
I'm glad you're here, but why didn't you
call to say that you were coming?

939
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,321
- I don't know, because...
- He said he's sleeping.

940
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,761
- OK. I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no, wait one second.

941
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,040
She said he says he's sleeping,
but if he was sleeping,

942
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,120
she'd just say he's sleeping,
so he's not sleeping.

943
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:44,169
- Let me talk to him.
- Can you talk to me for one second first?

944
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,402
Please? Come.

945
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,125
Percy and I are going to Miami
to see my father.

946
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,050
So why don't you come with us?

947
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,487
- What?
- Yeah, come with us.

948
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,291
You want me to go...
I can't come with you to Miami.

949
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,090
I don't... I got all...

950
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,765
I don't have any money.

951
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,571
I need to wait for another job,
for all this shit to blow over

952
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,051
with the internet,
Twitter, all that shit.

953
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,202
Yeah, but I could lend you
some money before you...

954
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,520
I don't want your money.
I can't take charity from you.

955
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,931
You know that he's really upset

956
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,606
because he couldn't go with you
to New Orleans, right?

957
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,640
He's hurt. He misses you.

958
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,967
OK. What do you
want me to do?

959
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,407
You know that the nannies
can't get on the plane.

960
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,245
So why don't you come with us

961
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,846
and you take care of him
while I work?

962
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,922
So you need me to come with you
to watch Percy?

963
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,003
- Yeah.
- So I'm the nanny?

964
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,811
Yes, his nanny, in Miami.

965
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,249
It might be good.
That's where it all happened for you.

966
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,731
That's where Percy was born,

967
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,167
that's where you got
your first job as a chef.

968
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,891
Maybe it will just, like,
clear your mind out.

969
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,168
You think Percy would be OK
with that?

970
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,924
Percy would love it.

00:54:32,544 --> 00:54:34,010
You're a sight for sore eyes.

1049
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,720
What you want to eat, something?
I want to see you eat something.

1050
00:54:36,744 --> 00:54:39,928
Alright? I'm worried.
Eat some crackers or something.

1051
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,570
Thanks.

1052
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,491
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- Look at you.

1053
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,325
She's pregnant. Just found out.

1054
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,369
The... This one?

1055
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,683
Pissed on a stick, came in,
laid it on me five seconds ago.

1056
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,691
Is it... So it's yours?

1057
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,207
I don't know.
That's what she's saying.

1058
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,646
- You don't...
- I know.

1059
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,451
I got a problem, 'cause she's...
best receptionist I've ever had.

1060
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,285
- Yeah.
- Good news is I had my tubes tied in '08.

1061
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,886
So, clearly,
she's also a fucking liar.

1062
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,407
- Right. That's tough.
- What do you want?

1063
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,891
You want a coconut water?

1064
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,610
- Um...
- You OK?

1065
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,171
I'm alright. I'm alright.

1066
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,840
- Do you want a drink?
- I would... No.

1067
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,809
Let's make some decisions together.
Let's start right here.

1068
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,520
- Alright, so...
- Let's start off easy.

1069
00:55:23,544 --> 00:55:26,410
We got shit to talk about.
Look, bang, you got four swatches, right?

1070
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,280
Let's start off easy and then
we'll get into the uncomfortable stuff.

1071
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,049
- Pick it.
- The... For the...

1072
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,804
For here? I don't know.

1073
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,291
Yeah, I'm putting a carpet down,

1074
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,410
'cause people keep slippin' around
like it's a fuckin' ice rink in here.

1075
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,928
You could always get 'em...
take the booties off and, uh...

1076
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,650
Can't do that.

1077
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,280
We'll go with,
I don't know, this one?

1078
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,845
- You like that one?
- I think...

1079
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,241
if I had to...
But if you're not gonna paint, I would...

1080
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,845
This just seems like
it goes with anything.

1081
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,600
People aren't walking
on the walls, Carl.

1082
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,125
Or I could keep it if I want.

1083
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,123
- The...
- Keep the kid.

1084
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,720
- Yeah.
- Knowing that it's not mine.

1085
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,411
- Yes.
- You know, for once, I'm a good guy.

1086
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,290
She stays on my desk
and I fucking got something on her.

1087
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,010
But you decide.
What do you think?

1088
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,840
Are we... we're talking about
the carpet now

1089
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,560
or are we talking about
the, um... the...

1090
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:11,712
- We're talking about...
- I don't even know anymore.

1091
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,446
I think, um...

1092
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,204
...I'd go with the brown.

1093
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:19,011
And as far as that goes,
that's a personal... that's...

1094
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,925
- I don't know.
- You're not a turd, OK?

1095
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,051
I don't want you to feel that way
coming in here with your hat in your hand.

1096
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,487
You went fucking crazy on the internet.
That was awesome.

1097
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,087
You lost respect, which I love,
'cause it's passion.

1098
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,571
You know, you lost everything.

1099
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,769
You know, you're not a loser,
but you have lost, OK?

1100
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,446
You're not a turd.
A turd that lost.

1101
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,409
I don't know
that I feel like a turd.

1102
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,528
- Good.
- I feel like I had a bad week.

1103
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,763
I feel like I lost my job,
I made an ass of myself on the internet.

1104
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,922
I'm divorced, I'm old,
I got no money.

1105
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,600
I live in a shitty apartment
in Venice.

1106
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,523
But you know
what makes me feel like a turd?

1107
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,680
That I'm in my ex-wife's ex-husband's
office and asking for a fucking favour

1108
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,349
and all he's doing
is busting my balls.

1109
00:56:57,429 --> 00:56:59,241
I like this humility. It's good.

1110
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,285
(SIGHS)

1111
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,009
Truth be told, food trucks are a
great idea. You know what I mean?

1112
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,447
I think we take it back
to something simple.

1113
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,251
Let me see if I got something
to say anymore. I don't even know.

1114
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,920
- It's no problem.
<i>- I'll</i> pay you back.

1115
00:57:14,944 --> 00:57:18,322
As long as it's not weird for you -
I don't want you to feel like

1116
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,920
because you were with Inez
and you guys were sleeping together

1117
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,208
and I was with her
and we had this...

1118
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,523
I was with her, then you were with her,
and then maybe I fucked her after.

1119
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,284
I don't even know
what happened with us.

1120
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,642
I came out to LA
for a Clippers game once

1121
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,451
and I think we had a couple of drinks
and we went to Islands.

1122
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,443
- And I think she had...
- What happened between you two?

1123
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,760
You know what? it doesn't matter.
Here's what happened.

1124
00:57:38,784 --> 00:57:41,922
We're talking about a white-on-white
'88 Chevy Grumman food truck.

1125
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,162
It's a blank canvas
for your dreams.

1126
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,890
I'm gonna have 'em
pull it around.

1127
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,650
Thank you.

1128
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,643
Don't thank me till you see it.

1129
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:15,290
CARL:
Yeah. I'm in Miami now.

1130
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,204
MARTIN ON PHONE:
What happened to those interviews you had?

1131
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,850
None of the prospects
panned out.

1132
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,650
- For real?
- Yeah.

1133
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,971
It sucks.

1134
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,120
I guess you'll have to stay there
for a while, bro.

1135
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,125
Hey, Carl. Hey, papi, mira,
I don't know if you heard or not, but...

1136
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,088
I got bumped up, man,
to sous-chef.

1137
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,571
- Sous-chef?
- Yeah.

1138
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,131
No shit! That's excellent!

1139
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,248
Congratulations, man.
That's a big deal.

1140
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,760
Thank you, man. That means a lot
coming from you, seriously.

1141
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,161
Yeah, but enough about me.
So, what are you gonna do?

1142
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,924
You're gonna laugh.

1143
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,242
- I got a food truck.
- Get the hell out!

1144
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,641
No shit.
You got a fucking taco truck?

1145
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,690
Tony! Tony, Carl's got
a fucking taco truck.

1146
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,569
- (SNIGGERS) For real?
- (LAUGHS)

1147
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,927
- Jefe! Like with tacos and shit?
- I just...

1148
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,447
Yeah, I would assume.
What are you gonna cook?

1149
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,366
You know, Cuban sandwiches,
plétanos, arroz con pollo.

1150
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,363
Simple shit like we used to do
for family meal.

1151
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,806
Oh, yeah,
I remember those days, man.

1152
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,008
- TONY: Fuck he doing with a taco truck?
- MARTIN: Goddamn.

1153
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,970
- I'd love some of that shit now.
- What's he doing with a taco truck?

1154
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,880
- It's good, right? It could be cool.
- Yeah.

1155
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,684
Get the fuck off the phone, bro.
Let's go!

1156
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,285
Alright, alright, alright!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.

1157
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,249
Attila the Hun is calling me.
I gotta go, man.

1158
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,811
CARL: Alright. Be good, man.

1159
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,811
- Is this the new truck?
- This is it. This is the truck.

1160
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,291
- Ahh!
- It's got good bones.

1161
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,920
It's gonna need
a lot of work, though.

1162
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,565
INEZ: What doesn't?

1163
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,484
Wanna take a look around, champ?

1164
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,971
- Do I have to?
- Go!

1165
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:35,851
Go and look at
your dad's new truck.

1166
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,446
Can I ask you a question?

1167
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,170
Is something wrong?

1168
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,448
- Did you sleep with him?
- With who?

1169
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,204
With Marvin.
Did you sleep with Marvin?

1170
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,010
But of course I did.
He's my ex-husband.

1171
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,080
I mean, since we were divorced.
Have you slept...

1172
00:59:48,104 --> 00:59:49,969
Who did you sleep with last,
him or me?

1173
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,401
I'm sorry, but this is
none of your business what I did...

1174
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,360
- I think it might be.
- ..after I divorce you.

1175
00:59:54,384 --> 00:59:57,786
Second of all, I don't ask you
what you do with your hot little waitress.

1176
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,206
- That's completely different.
- OK, really.

1177
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,760
- And that's not fair.
- Yeah, yeah.

1178
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,840
This is somebody you loved
and shared a life with...

1179
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:04,683
Why do we have to
talk about this right now?

1180
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,680
Because I took a business meeting
with the guy.

1181
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:08,762
- This is not the moment.
- It is. I wanna know why.

1182
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,600
He's smiling like
he's got something on me.

1183
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,400
- I dunno what it is.
- Please, you know him.

1184
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,886
- I do know how him.
- You know how he is. So who cares?

1185
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,440
- I care!
- Why do you need to know?

1186
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,443
- I just would like to...
- OK.

1187
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,160
It doesn't bother me.
I just wanna know.

1188
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,847
Just listen. I was very sad.
I was very lonely.

1189
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,082
- And you, more than anyone, know...
- OK. That's it. That's enough.

1190
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,129
...how I get after I have
a couple of drinks.

1191
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,080
- I don't want to know the details.
- I get...

1192

01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,928
That's called a plantain.
Plétanos.

1341
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,605
These are maduros.
Feel, soft?

1342
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,364
- Mm-hm.
- That's the sweet kind.

1343
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:23,046
But we want the green ones.
Here. Hang onto this.

1344
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,884
This is what
you make tostones with.

1345
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,769
That's Martin's favourite.

1346
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,651
- I got it. I got it.
- You got it? Too much?

1347
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,404
- I got it.
- OK.

1348
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,767
- Watch out for tarantulas. Come on.
- What?

1349
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,811
(ROBERTY ROENA Y YU APOLLO
SOUND PLAY 'QUE SE SEPA')

1350
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,926
Ahh! That's good.

1351
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,411
Oh, look at that.

1352
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,803
Oh, yeah.
My masterpiece, baby.

1353
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,521
- That's beautiful.
- Miami, I am back. Pow!

1354
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,002
You could have just bought this at the
store. I think they sold it there.

1355
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,280
- You sure that's your son, man?
- I don't know.

1356
01:09:29,436 --> 01:09:30,767
You'd better get
a paternity test.

1357
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:34,645
- Oh, that looks incred...
- Can I have some?

1358
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,768
Oh, Martin.

1359
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,649
- Please, just gimme some.
- It's not from the store.

1360
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,041
- You might not like it.
- It's fatty but not heavy, you know?

1361
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,850
- You don't want any of this.
- Yes, I do.

1362
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,809
- You're probably vegan. You can't eat it.
- I'm not vegan.

1363
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:47,520
- It's not from the store.
- Oh, my God.

1364
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,086
- Martin, come on. Can I have some?
- Hold on a second.

1365
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,480
- Can I give him a piece, Martin?
- Nah, man, he's not...

1366
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,240
- Alright. Let me think about it.
- Just a little piece. Let's see.

1367
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,923
- Pretty good.
- Pretty good?

1368
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,320
- Pretty good? Come on!
- Better than the store? (LAUGHS)

1369
01:10:02,344 --> 01:10:03,344
One more.
Just one more.

1370
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,647
The best shit you ever had
in your life. Come on, man.

1371
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,520
Oh, give me another one. If you're
gonna give him some, give me some.

1372
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:09,800
- Don't be cheap.
- I want more.

1373
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,600
You know what?
Let's make some sandwiches.

1374
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,865
- Yes, sir. Let's get to it.
- Alright. Ready to go?

1375
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:16,520
Hey, little man,
is the plancha red-hot?

1376
01:10:16,544 --> 01:10:18,887
"Huh?
"Me?

1377
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,008
No, I'm talking to the grill.
Yeah, you.

1378
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,923
- Do I touch it?
- Well, what do you think?

1379
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,321
- No.
- That's right. No, genius.

1380
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,084
Hey, look.
Come over here, look.

1381
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,651
- See this water?
- Mm-hm.

1382
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,121
- Bang. Is it hot?
- Yes.

1383
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,203
- Tell him it's hot.
- It's hot.

1384
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,328
- OK.
- Is it hot as your daddy's underwear?

1385
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,811
Good. Now, watch.
Come over here.

1386
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,644
Here we go, papi. Perfect.
Perfecto.

1387
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,484
CARL: Now, watch me.
Watch what I'm doing.

1388
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,240
MARTIN: Two slices of ham,
three of pork.

1389
01:10:43,389 --> 01:10:45,509
- CARL: Now come over here.
- MARTIN: Now the maestro.

1390
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,480
CARL: Two slices of cheese -
one, two.

1391
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,722
- Two pickles.
- Can I do pickles?

1392
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,609
Big pickles. Nice. One, two.

1393
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,366
Now, watch this.
Take this - mustard, from end to end.

1394
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,681
OK.

1395
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,524
You go side to side,
not forward and back.

1396
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,409
Now, this is
the most important part.

1397
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,562
- This is what makes it a Cubano.
- OK.

1398
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,370
- Take the butter. See that?
- Yeah.

1399
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,251
On top. Take a little bit.

1400
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,687
- Butter the grill.
- (OIL SIZZLES)

1401
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,683
In. Just like that.

1402
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,649
Now, watch.

1403
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,882
I want you to watch for
the bread to get golden.

1404
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,804
I want you to watch
for the cheese to melt.

1405
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,201
When that cheese is melted
and that bread's golden, but not burnt,

1406
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,601
you call me, you tell me it's done
and we'll check, OK?

1407
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,330
- OK.
- Keep an eye on it.

1408
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,407
I want you to watch
everything everybody's doing,

1409
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,564
because when we're hopping,
you're gonna have to jump in on the line

1410
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:39,051
and help out.

1411
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,601
- I think it's done.
- You think it's done?

1412
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:46,446
- MARTIN: Oh, look at that.
- CARL: See how golden that is?

1413
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,480
- That's how you want it every time.
- Nice job.

1414
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,522
You gotta be like a robot
when you're on a line.

1415
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,200
You're the shit, baby.
You're the shit.

1416
01:11:52,224 --> 01:11:52,962
OK?

1417
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:56,044
MARTIN: Mmm!
Three equal pieces.

1418
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,248
- Let's see what we got.
- Alright, here we go.

1419
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,641
- Oh, hot.
- Ah. Let me see.

1420
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,600
- (CHUCKLES) Look at that cheese.
- (CRUNCHES)

1421
01:12:02,624 --> 01:12:04,728
- Oh, my God, man.
- This is the shit.

1422
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,450
- This is it.
- Oh!

1423
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,011
- This is it.
- This is it.

1424
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,891
- It's incredible.
- This is empingao.

1425
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,361
- Oh, empingao!
- Empingao, man.

1426
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,126
- So, is it good?
- It's amazing.

1427
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,248
- Then I guess we're open.
- (SPEAKS SPANISH)

1428
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,482
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
We're open?

1429
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,008
I didn't get to finish
my sandwich.

1430
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,162
- Here you go.
- What do I do?

1431
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,920
- Cut the bread.
- (OTHERS SPEAK SPANISH)

1432
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,291
There's cerveza down there.

1433
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,440
Little man, get me hazelnuts,
get me some more ham.

1434
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,885
PERCY: OK.

1435
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,122
(ALL TALK AT ONCE)

1436
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,362
Alright, I got four right here.

1437
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,841
(ALL TALK AT ONCE)

1438
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,120
Hey, jefe, this sound system
sounds like ass.

1439
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,124
But my cousin knows a guy who'll hook us up
with all our musical necessities.

1440
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,880
My credit cards are maxed out
and we're not charging for food yet.

1441
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,880
- So we'll wait on the sound system.
- But you look happy, baby, don't you?

1442
01:12:59,034 --> 01:13:01,234
- So happy. So happy.
- Yeah, that's what's champing it.

1443
01:13:01,274 --> 01:13:02,274
Uh-huh!

1444
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:04,448
- I got one.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1445
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,965
- That's burnt.
- So?

1446
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,202
They're not paying for it.

1447
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,601
Come with me.
Get off the truck.

1448
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,920
- You got this?
- MARTIN: Yeah, I got it. You get down.

1449
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,764
Slow down for a second.

1450
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,160
- Is this boring to you?
- No, I like it.

1451
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,651
Yeah, well, I love it.

1452
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,561
Everything good that's happened to me
in my life came because of that.

1453
01:13:23,585 --> 01:13:26,205
I might not do everything great
in my life, OK?

1454
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,283
I'm not perfect.
I'm not the best husband.

1455
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,681
And I'm sorry if I wasn't
the best father.

1456
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,090
But I'm good at this.

1457
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,564
And I wanna share this with you.

1458
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,802
I wanna teach you
what I learned.

1459
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,645
I get to touch people's lives
with what I do.

1460
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,682
And it keeps me going,
andl love it

1461
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,331
And I think if you give it a shot,
you might love it too.

1462
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,970
Yes, Chef.

1463
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,840
Now, should we have served
that sandwich?

1464
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,689
No, Chef.

1465
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,360
That's my son. Get back in there.
We got some hungry people.

1466
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:00,890
He's ready to cook!

1467
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,044
- MARTIN: We did good, man.
- CARL: We did good.

1468
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,441
- We got something here.
- I say we stick with the traditional menu.

1469
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,443
- We don't get too fancy.
- We'll get some yucca fries.

1470
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,840
- We got the fryer.
- That's classic. Another beer, boss?

1471
01:14:10,864 --> 01:14:12,468
- No, I'm good.
- Alright.

1472
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,571
Here you go, little man.

1473
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,210
You sure?

1474
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,769
Is this beer?

1475
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,763
No, of course not.
I would never hand you beer.

1476
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,491
- That's cerveza.
- I'm 10. I can't have beer.

1477
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,531
You're not 10. You're kitchen staff.
Kitchen staff doesn't have an age.

1478
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,603
- (SNIGGERS)
- Dad?

1479
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,250
You can have a sip.

1480
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,331
"Huh?

1481
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,925
- Like piss, right?
- Worse.

1482
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,923
You remember that
when your friends offer you a beer.

1483
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:44,525
- I figure we go to South Beach...
- Mm-hm.

1484
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,808
...stake out the truck a little bit,
get the menu straight.

1485
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:49,160
Then after we're really confident
we got something good,
