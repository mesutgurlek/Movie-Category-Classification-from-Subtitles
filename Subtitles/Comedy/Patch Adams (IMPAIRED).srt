on my own time ?

Yes, about your own time.

Who appointed you custodian
of the medical profession ?

- You're damn right.
- Really ?

I grew up with it.

This is serious business !

I have it in me
to be a great doctor...

laughing and have a good time, ha ha,

because the more I learn,

805
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,400
the more likely I will
have the right answer at the
crucial moment and save a life.

You say I'm a prick ?

You know, maybe I am,

death comes knocking at their door...

whether they want a prick on their side

We're all dying, Truman.

You know what that means ?

- I want to graduate, sir.

so I can become a doctor.

Well, I'm gonna give this
to you real straight.

I have a hospital and a medical school
to run here.

and I would never take the word
of any student over his.

for the patients.

They don't complain as much,
they take less medication...

01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,200
- I gotta tell Carin.
- What ?

1071
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,800
Oh.

1072
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,200
- Can I borrow this stuff ?
- Sure.

- [ Carin ] Patch, it's late.

Parsley.

- And a horn.
- No, no, no.

Look beyond the objects.
Look through them.

1079

Over here. Look.

1080
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,120
Kind of let them blur.
Tell me the first thing you see.

1081
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,360
- Something with a nose.
- Okay.

1082
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,960
Now imagine that's a building
with a nose.

1083

- A free hospital.
- A free hospital.

- Can I go back to bed now ?
- No, no.

Because I'm bursting with ideas,
and I need you to help me.

1086

It'll be the first fun hospital
in the world.

1087
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,680
It'll be a totally
free-form building.

1088
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,960
It'll have, like, slides
and secret passageways and game rooms.

- Slow down. I can't write that fast.
- I can't slow down.

We'll use humor
to heal pain and suffering.

1091
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,400
Doctors and patients
will work side-by-side as peers.

1092
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,040
There'll be no titles,
no bosses.

1093
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:39,200
People will come from all over
the world to fulfill their dream
of helping other people.

1094

They'll be a community
where joy is a way of life...

where love is the ultimate goal.

- Yeah, not verbatim, but
the overall insanity's intact.

- That's why you have to help me.
- Patch, no.

- Yes.
- No.

1099

I know it's not gonna be easy, but you
said anything worth doing is difficult.

I'm not like you, Patch.

1102

I want the white coat. I want people
to call me doctor more than anything.

1103
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,240
- I want the recognition.
- You'll get it every day in the
eyes of patients you're helping.

1104
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:11,760
There is more to life than
what Dean Walcott puts out there.

1105
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,720
That is all about power
and control, all right ?

1106
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,280
- I know you're scared.
- You're right. I am scared.

1107
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,200
I'm scared to death.

1108
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,600
You know, you sit here and you talk
about life without limits...

1109
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,440
you know,
and breaking the rules.

1110
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,320
It all sounds
very, very romantic.

1111
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,960
You wanna know what the truth
is about all that crap, Patch, hmm ?

1112
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,560
People get hurt.

1113
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,360
And who did it to you ?

1114

- I have to go.
- No, don't. Please. No, no.
Listen to me. Come on.

1115
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,840
Whatever it is-- Come on.
You can tell me.

1116
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,240
- I can help you. I swear I can.
- Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

1117
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,240
Please, let me help you.

1118

I'm really starting to love

Get this cleaned out,
and get him down to the suture room.

1122

You're gonna be fine, Larry.

1123
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:30,440
Larry's been in and out of
the E.R. for a couple of years.

1124
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,640
- Not because he's accident-prone.
- No. His father died two years ago.

1125
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,760
Since then he's been subject to fits
of depression and self-mutilation.

1126
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,960
Head trauma, D-5.

1127

- Thank you for doing this.
- You can thank me
by not getting me fired.

1128
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:49,880
Just observe rounds
and stay within hospital protocol.

1129
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,800
Look, Patch.

1130
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,440
You're a good thing
for this hospital.

1131
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,600
You remind me of myself
when I first started out--

on fire,
wanting to save the world.

1133
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,640
But you lose a little of that
after a while.

1134
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,400
The system is what it is. It's not
perfect, but it's all we have.

1135
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,280
Why does it have to be all we have ?
Why can't it be changed ?

1136
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,120
You figure out how, Patch...

1137
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,040
and I'll be there for you.

1522
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:26,000
Sir, will you define
treatment for me ?

1523
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:30,640
Yes. Treatment would be defined
as the care of a patient
seeking medical attention.

1524
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,960
Have you been treating patients,
Mr. Adams ?

1525
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,880
I live with several people.
They come and go as they please.

1526
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,840
I offer them
whatever help I can.

1527
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,880
Mr. Adams...

1528
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:45,880
have you or have you not
been treating patients at your ranch ?

1529
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,120
Everyone who comes to the ranch
is a patient, yes.

1530
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,920
[ Murmuring ]

1531
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,120
And every person who comes
to the ranch is also a doctor.

1532
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,200
I'm sorry ?

1533
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,680
Every person who comes
to the ranch is in need...

1534
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,360
of some form of physical
or mental help.

1535
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,320
They're patients.

1536
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:13,520
But also every person who comes
to the ranch is in charge of
taking care of someone else--

1537
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,480
whether it's cooking for them,
cleaning them...

1538
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,320
or even as simple a task
as listening.

1539
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,240
That makes them doctors.

1540
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:25,400
I use that term broadly, but is not a
doctor someone who helps someone else ?

1541
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:29,400
When did the term "doctor" get
treated with such reverence, as,
"Right this way, Doctor Smith"...

1542
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,320
or, "Excuse me, Dr. Scholl,
what wonderful footpads"...

1543
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:35,920
or, "Pardon me, Dr. Patterson,
but your flatulence has no odor" ?

1544
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,480
[ Laughing, Murmuring ]

1545
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:41,960
At what point in history
did a doctor become more...

1546
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:46,080
than a trusted and learned friend
who visited and treated the ill ?

1547
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:49,200
Now, you ask me if
I've been practicing medicine.

1548
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:52,240
Well, if this means opening
your door to those in need--

1549
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,560
those in pain--

1550
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:59,800
caring for them, listening
to them, applying a cold cloth
until a fever breaks--

1551
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:02,080
if this is practicing medicine,
if this is treating a patient...

1552
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:04,600
then I am guilty
as charged, sir.

1553
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:08,120
Did you consider the ramifications
of your actions ?

1554
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,400
What if one of your patients
had died ?

1555
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,720
What's wrong
with death, sir ?

1556
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,160
What are we so mortally
afraid of ?

1557
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:18,360
Why can't we treat death with
a certain amount of humanity
and dignity and decency...

1558
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:20,920
and, God forbid,
maybe even humor ?

1559
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,880
Death is not the enemy,
gentlemen.

1560
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,760
If we're gonna fight a disease,
let's fight one of the most
terrible diseases of all--

1561
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,680
indifference.

1562
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:31,640
Now, I've sat in your schools and heard
people lecture on transference...

1563
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:33,560
and professional distance.

1564
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:36,000
Transference
is inevitable, sir.

1565
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:38,480
Every human being
has an impact on another.

1566
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,880
Why don't we want that in
a patient/doctor relationship ?

1567
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:46,200
That's why I've listened to your
teachings, and I believe they're wrong.

1568
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:50,000
A doctor's mission should be
not just to prevent death...

1569
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,120
but also to improve
the quality of life.

1570
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:55,200
That's why you treat a disease,
you win, you lose.

1571
01:38:55,280 --> 01:39:00,280
You treat a person, I guarantee you,
you win, no matter what the outcome.

1572
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,520
Now here today, this room
is full of medical students.

1573
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,120
Don't let them anesthetize you.
Don't let them numb you out
to the miracle of life.

1574
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,520
Always live in awe of the
glorious mechanism of the human body.

1575
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,680
Let that be the focus of your studies
and not a quest for grades...

1576
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,560
which'll give you no idea what kind
of doctor you will become.

1577
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,640
[ Man ]
Please try and address the board.

1578
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:24,640
Don't wait till you're on the ward
to get your humanity back.

1579
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:27,080
Start your interviewing skills.
Start talking to strangers.

1580
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,720
Talk to your friends,
Talk to wrong numbers, everyone.

1581
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,560
- Mr. Adams !
- And cultivate friendships...

1582
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:35,800
with those amazing people in the back of
the room-- nurses that could teach you.

1583
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,840
They've been with people every day.
They wade through blood and shit.

1584
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:42,720
They have a wealth of knowledge,
and so do the professors you respect--

1585
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,920
the ones who are not dead
from the heart up.

1586
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,720
- Share their compassion.
Let that be contagious.
- Mr. Adams.

1587
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,120
I demand that you turn
and address the board.

1588
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,000
Sir, I want to be a doctor
with all my heart.

1589
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:09,080
I wanted to become a doctor
so I could serve others...

1590
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:11,520
and because of that
I've lost everything...

1591
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,200
but I've also
gained everything.

1592
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:18,240
I've shared the lives of patients
and staff members at the hospital.

1593
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,120
I've laughed with them.
I've cried with them.

1594
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:24,760
This is what I want to do
with my life.

1595
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:29,840
And as God is my witness...

1596
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,240
no matter what your decision
today, sir...

1597
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:37,040
I will still become the best damn doctor
the world has ever seen.

1598
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:42,080
Now you have the ability
to prevent me from graduating.

1599
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:46,200
You can keep me from getting
the title and the white coat.

1600
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,440
But you can't control
my spirit, gentlemen.

1601
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:52,120
You can't keep me from learning.
You can't keep me from studying.

1602
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:55,160
So you have a choice-- you could
have me as a professional colleague...

1603
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,120
passionate...

1604
01:40:57,160 --> 01:41:00,320
or you can have me as an
outspoken outsider, still adamant.

1605
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:03,320
Either way, I'll probably
still be viewed as a thorn.

1606
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,600
But I promise you one thing.

1607
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:08,240
I am a thorn
that will not go away.

1608
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:13,040
Is that all ?

1609
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,120
I hope not, sir.

[ Sighs ] We find your methods
less than appealing.

1617
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,680
Your appearance and your demeanor
do not reflect...

1618
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,600
what we believe
is necessary...

1619
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:57,640
to earn a patient's trust
and respect.

1620
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:02,600
You openly accuse us of adhering
to time-honored practices...

1621
01:43:02,680 --> 01:43:07,280
that for years have been the backbone
of the entire medical institution.

1622
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,800
However...

1623
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:13,920
we find no fault
in your attempts...

to improve the quality of life
around you.

1625
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,760
We find no fault
in your desire...

1626
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:23,680
to expand upon existing
medical practices...

We applaud your love
of the patient.

1629

Your grades are among
the highest in your class...

1630
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:34,480
and, therefore, we find
no merit in the decision...

1631
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,320
to block your graduation
from medical school.

1632

Now, along with your crass
and disdainful behavior...

you carry with you a flame...

which one could only hope...

would spread through

It's been a long night

1672
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:42,120
Trying to find my way

1673
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,960
Been through the darkness

1674
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:49,280
Now I finally have my day

1675
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:53,640
And I will see my dream
come alive at last

1676
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:56,920
I will touch the sky

1677
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,800
And they're not gonna
hold me down no more

1678
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:04,040
No, they're not gonna
change my mind

1679
01:48:04,120 --> 01:48:08,560
'Cause I've got faith
of the heart

1680
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:11,480
I'm going where my heart
will take me

1681
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:15,840
I've got faith to believe

1682
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:19,000
I can do anything

1683
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:23,200
I've got strength
of the soul

1684
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:26,280
And no one's gonna bend
or break me

1685
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:30,360
I can reach any star

1686
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:35,680
-  I've got faith
-  I've got, I've got faith

1687
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,600
Faith of the heart

1688
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:43,920
I've known a wind so cold

1689
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,880
I've seen the darkest days

1690
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:51,240
But now the winds I feel

1691
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:54,160
Are only winds of change

1692
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,680
I've been through the fire

1693
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,520
And I've been through
the rain

1694
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:03,800
But I'll be fine

1695
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:07,480
-  Oh, yeah
-  'Cause I got faith

1696
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:09,760
Of the heart

1697
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,600
I'm going where my heart
will take me

1698
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:17,000
I've got faith to believe

1699
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:19,840
I can do anything

1700
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:24,040
I've got strength
of the soul

1701
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:27,320
And no one's gonna bend
or break me

1702
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:31,120
I can reach any star

1703
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:34,840
-  I got, I got, I got
-  I've got faith

1704
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:39,320
-  Faith of the
-  Faith of the heart

1705
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,000
I'm going where my heart
will take me

1706
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:46,320
I've got faith to believe

1707
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:49,400
And no one's gonna bend
or break me

1708
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:53,520
I can reach any star

1709
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:58,680
-  'Cause I've got faith
-  I've got, I've got, I've got

1710
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:01,080
'Cause I've got faith

1711
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:06,240
Faith of the heart

1712
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:15,200
It's been a long road
