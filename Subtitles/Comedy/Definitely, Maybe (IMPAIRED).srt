<i>MAYA: (CHUCKLING)</i>
<i>You wanted to be President?</i>

158
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,365
I'm just, I don't understand why you have
to work for Clinton in New York.

159
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,307
Why can't you just work for him in Madison?

160
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,436
Well, because they don't need me here.
They need me in New York.

161
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:17,812
They need him, Em. Will's the man.
I can't believe you're letting him go.

162
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,783
I mean, don't you know
about New York girls?

163
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,218
Besides being incredibly hot,
they have no problem with casual sex,

164
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,381
which by the way, I totally respect.

165
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,721
- What if Charlie's right?
- Charlie's never right.

166
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,751
- He's functionally retarded.
- I am worried New York's gonna change you.

167
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,855
- Change can be good.
- If we change together.

168
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,628
So, we'll change together.

169
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,727
Okay? It's two months in New York.
I'll be back before you know it.

170
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,998
Besides, we have a plan, right?

171
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,508
The other thing I can't believe is that
you'd risk leaving Emily here with me,

172
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:47,603
'cause I gotta tell you,
I've always had a thing for you...

173
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,748
And I have absolutely no scruples.

174
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:56,780
Wait! I almost forgot.
You have to give this to Summer.

175
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,147
She's the only girl I know in New York.

176
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,316
- I want you to meet her.
- Summer Hartley?

177
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,654
- Yes. Yes.
- That's her name?

178
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,455
She was on my exchange program
at Cambridge,

179
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,827
and all the guys wanted to sleep with her,
and you probably will, too.

180
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,058
Maybe you should mail it to her.

181
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,293
- That might be a better idea.
- No.

182
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,356
What is it?

183
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,768
Something I should have
sent her a long time ago.

184
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,330
I love you, William Hayes.

- Hey. Gareth Henderson.
- You're Gareth.

201
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,095
- Hey, how are you?
- Nice to meet you. We're walking, Hayes.

202
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:21,435
I brought my C.V. and a sample of some
speeches I wrote for Congressman Sweeney.

203
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:25,466
Fantastic. I cannot wait to peruse these
in my abundant spare time.

204
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,638
In the meantime, here's a sample
of the coffee and bagel order

205
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,477

You want me to get coffee?

At some point in our lives, we all get coffee.
Your time's now. Come on.

We're still walking, Hayes.

210
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,485
Have the coffee here by 10:00,
or Arthur's gonna kill me!

211
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,528
That means I'm gonna have to kill you.
I've killed before, Hayes.

212
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,588
- You should know that.
- What is this?

213
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,257
That is a cellular telephone

214
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:51,633
so I can get a hold of you wherever,
whenever, for whatever.

215
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,730
- Can somebody get me an aspirin, please?
- Watch it!

216
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,968
Glad to have you aboard, Hayes!

will select their next Democratic nominee
for President.

Now, if Bill Clinton wins,

And I mean that. That's just a fact.

- 3.25.

3.25? These are $2.15
in Madison, Wisconsin.

233
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,229
So go back to Madison.

00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,539
No. Yeah.

238
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,477
But I didn't mean to tell you that.

239
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:11,306
Listen. I was young, and I was stupid,
and I haven't smoked in years.

240
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,509
I promise you.

241
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,782
Is there anything else you should tell me?

242
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,255
Probably not.

243
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,698
- Can I get 10 copies?
- Put them on the pile.

244

No, they're for Arthur.
I need them like, 15 minutes ago.

245

So if you wouldn't mind...

246
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,328

<i>WILLIAM: That's April.</i>

the bagel-and-coffee guy.

- Ten. Please.

I'm not. This is a money gig.
I get paid 12 an hour,

255
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:03,531
which is better than babysitting, which is
what I've been doing way too much of.

You're a Democrat, right?

What about civil rights or women's rights?

265
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,923
A woman's right to do what she wants
with her body? What about that?

266
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:31,485
I do what I want with my body.

267
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,929
That's apathetic.

- I'm not apathetic.
- Yes, you are.

269
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,135
I'm not. I just know that these bozos
you're working for,

they don't care about anything more
than their own ambitions.

456
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,241
Keep a hard copy.
That might be nice for me.

(BOTH LAUGHING)

458
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,544
I wonder why Emily gave it to you
to give to me.

459
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,709
Hmm.

460
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,084
Hampton?

461
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:00,224
- Hampton?
- Are you gonna join us?

462
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,658
That's Hampton Roth.
He's an incredible writer.

463
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,821
- His book on the McGovern campaign is...
- Yeah.

464
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,966
- You...
- Yeah. We do.

465
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,198
Look, have you ever actually
had sex with a sexagenarian?

466
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,263
- I haven't.
- Well, then you shouldn't really judge.

467
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,333
Well, actually, I'm not judging. Look at you.

468
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,710
You're beautiful. You're sophisticated.
You're a very talented writer.

469
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:23,805
Thank you.

470
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,214
I mean, to please a woman like you,
it would obviously take a...

471
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,013
- Real man.
- Exactly.

472
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:32,284
- Hard to compete with that.
- Well, unless you're the competitive type.

473
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,995
- Yep, nice to meet you.
- Yeah, it was great meeting you, too.

474
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,025
I feel horrible about taking the...

475
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,872
Sorry.

476
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,912
I was just curious.

477
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,949
Hampton encourages me
to cultivate my curiosity.

478
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,946
He says it's the key
to being a good journalist.

479
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,684
Yeah.

480
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,952
HAMPTON: Summer! Daddy's hungry!

481
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,621
- Speak of the devil. Better go. Yeah.
- Hmm.

482
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,757
HAMPTON: Where the hell are you?

483
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,495
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

484
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,327
Yeah, give us a call sometime.
We should all go out for dinner.

485
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,169
I'd... Yeah, I'd love dinner.

486
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,674
- Yeah.
- HAMPTON: Hey!

487
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,637
- Are you gonna call her?
- Are you insane?

488
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,944
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- What am I gonna do?

490
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:37,612
I'm gonna keep my eye on the ball.
Emily and I have a future. We have a plan.

491
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,589
Which may involve
some type of threesome now.

492
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,320
Or foursome
if that old dude is still in the picture.

<i>MAYA: What's a threesome?</i>

496
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,834
- What?
- A threesome.

497
00:27:56,241 --> 00:28:00,268
That's a game that adults play sometimes
when they're bored.

498
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,015
Whatever. So what happened with Emily?

499
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,609
Nothing. I wanted to wait
till she came for a visit,

500
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,520

something really dramatic.

that the Governor comes from
a town called Hope.

for a pack of cigarettes?

00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,208
They don't put as many chemicals in them.

- So those are healthy cigarettes.
- Something like that.

586
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,138
So if there's not as many chemicals in them,

587
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:33,308
they should cost less, not more,
don't you think?

588
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:36,080
They put saltpeter in your cigarettes,

589
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:39,612
which make them burn faster,
which make you smoke more.

590
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:45,253
Which means, at the end of the day,
your cigarettes actually cost more, not less.

591

Copy girl,
what I think you're actually paying for

which, of course, he takes 'cause...

605

For my 13th birthday,
I wanted a pair of gold stud earrings,

00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,457
and instead my dad bought me
a hardcover copy of <i>Jane Eyre.</i>

702
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,796
And inside, he wrote a beautiful inscription,
which I could care less about at the time

703
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:59,597
seeing as I was so pissed
about the earrings,

my mom sold our house

He's worked his way up from the streets.

He was a cop, an entrepreneur.

To keep that rampant,
rapacious ambition of yours in check.

977

I have a thought.

978

Why don't you use that newly acquired
scintilla of power and influence

979

to get Summer here
to write an article about your man Robredo?

and you get the word out.

- Yeah.

982

Yeah, that's what I'm about.

Telling me this story,
this mystery love story.

And you're not my father.

with all of this anyway?
