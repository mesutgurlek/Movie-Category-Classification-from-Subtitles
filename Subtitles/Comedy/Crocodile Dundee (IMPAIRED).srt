was attacked by a crocodile.

out of the bush,

eat me on the spot.

take you down to the
bottom of the water,

and roll you over and over and
over till you stop kicking.

with the grip he had on me,

667
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,826
No, it's... It's all right.

668
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,653
I'll have a lash.

669
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,576
- Italian, eh?
- RICHARD: Yes.

670
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:48,237
I don't know what you call it,
but I'd like to look at that dish

671
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,306
out there the big fat
sheila's eating.

672
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,514
Richard!

673
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,103
He okay?

674
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,110
Can't handle his drink, poor fella.

675
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,515
SUE: He said you hit him.

676
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,352
You're not in the pub
at Walkabout Creek now.

677
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,377
- He was being a pain.
- That's beside the point.

678
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,608
You're not serious about
this lemon, are you?

679
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,336
Butt out, Dundee!

680
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,051
He had a little too much to drink.

681
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,823
Richard is warm, caring,
and I love him, okay?

682
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,158
- Excuse me.
- What?

683
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,977
I think I'm going to throw up.

684
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:37,471
God.

685
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,124
- You want a hand?
- No. I can handle it.

686

687
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,901
Listen, we've got a busy day
tomorrow, so get some sleep.

689
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,128
I'll pick you up early.

690
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:11,676
- Good night.
- Good night.

691
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,374
- I think you better take me to the boozer.
- Boozer?

692
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,227
Don't know that one.

693
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,920
Pub. You know, somewhere
to get a drink.

694
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,366
- Want to join me?
- I just finished my shift. Why not?

695
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,094
- Fancy a drink, do you?
- You kidding? I'm Italian.

696
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:38,290
I'd drink you under the
table any day, my friend.

697
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,792
Well, that could be interesting.

MICK: No, I'm not putting
down your black widow spider,

699
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,324

kill a man in eight seconds,

700
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,426

down there is the sharks, though,

703

704
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,627
I caught one down there
about three weeks ago.

705
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,901
Got it opened. Know what
we found inside it?

706
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,359
Three Filipino fishermen...

707
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,801
- Still in their boat.
- Hey, buzzy!

Uh, where?

What's goin' down, bro?

712
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:30,630
Goin' down? Ah, yeah. Just
blowing the froth off a couple.

713
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,424
All right! Hang loose, my man.

Yeah. Mostly buffaloes.

No, I just toss them.
