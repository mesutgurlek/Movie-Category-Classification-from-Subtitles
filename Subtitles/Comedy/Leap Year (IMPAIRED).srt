So happy you're here.

This is the third open

Well...

Don't worry.

7

I have everything
under control.

00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:33,114
Anna, you are a realtor?

9
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:38,223
I'm a stager. I stage
apartments for realtors.

Not the Davenport,
of course.

15

It's just a very fine line
between elegant and dowdy.

16
00:01:55,013 --> 00:01:57,277
I just think maybe
a quarter-inch higher.

17

33

You know it's not about luck.
It's about preparation.

34

Well, hundreds
of years ago,

00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:36,929
there was this beautiful
girl called Grainne.

722
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,466
Now, she was promised in marriage
to this fella called Fionn,

723
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:45,406
who was kind of
a cranky old warlord,

old enough to be her father,
old enough to be her grandfather,

(SPLUTTERS)

of their betrothal,

729
00:40:55,185 --> 00:40:59,622
whom did she meet but a
handsome young warrior, Diarmuid.

730
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:04,024
They fell madly in love at first
sight, but what could she do?

731
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,857
Well, she slips a sleeping
potion in everyone's drinks,

732
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:11,492
and the pair of them run off
together across the Shannon.

733
00:41:12,502 --> 00:41:16,996
Fionn wakes and there's Grainne
gone. Well, he goes mental.

heads off in hot pursuit.

But it was the people, you know, the
people in the villages of Ireland,

736
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:28,110
they took pity on
Diarmuid and Grainne.

737
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:32,052
They hid them in forests and
in their barns and castles,

and then they'd move on.

Diarmuid, good man that he was,

00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:50,502
was suffering the old guilt
about two-timing Fionn

Will you marry me?

1433
01:32:42,556 --> 01:32:46,390
In all my life, I never thought
I'd see you down on one knee.

1434
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:50,156
Yeah, it's getting
a bit damp down here, so...

1435
01:32:51,898 --> 01:32:55,129
What's it to be,
Anna from Boston?

1436
01:32:57,504 --> 01:32:58,562
Yes.

1437
01:32:59,606 --> 01:33:01,005
Yes, I will.

1438
01:33:32,872 --> 01:33:34,271
I'm so relieved.
For a minute there,

1439
01:33:34,341 --> 01:33:37,071
I thought I wasn't gonna
have a place to stay tonight.

1440
01:33:37,143 --> 01:33:38,235
What?

1441
01:33:39,145 --> 01:33:41,545
You think you're staying with me?

1442
01:33:42,082 --> 01:33:43,845
This might cost you.

1443
01:33:45,018 --> 01:33:46,883
Put it on my bill.

1444
01:33:52,826 --> 01:33:54,521
Would you
look at that!

1445
01:33:54,594 --> 01:33:59,190
On a Sunday, no less. It's good
luck to get engaged on a Sunday.

1446
01:34:01,301 --> 01:34:02,962
And end a journey.

1447
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:05,133
Aye, and dig a well.

1448
01:34:05,271 --> 01:34:08,468
Idiot! Do they look like
they're digging a well?

1449
01:34:09,576 --> 01:34:11,134
JOE: You know what
I'm talking about.

1450
01:34:11,211 --> 01:34:14,078
SEAMUS: I never know
what you're talking about.

1452
01:34:28,828 --> 01:34:30,955
Are you sure
she's gonna make it?

1453
01:34:31,531 --> 01:34:33,624
Remember,
she's a classic.

1454
01:34:34,601 --> 01:34:35,625
And she's good as new,

1455
01:34:35,702 --> 01:34:38,694
even after some crazy woman
tried to push her off the road.

1456
01:34:38,772 --> 01:34:40,034
I didn't try to
push her off the road!

1457
01:34:40,106 --> 01:34:41,937
I was scraping
cow poo off my shoe

1458
01:34:42,008 --> 01:34:44,772
'cause some rude man wouldn't
help me with the cows.

1459
01:34:45,045 --> 01:34:48,503
Only because someone was being
pigheaded and couldn't wait.

1460
01:34:49,749 --> 01:34:50,943
Shut up.

01:34:52,118 --> 01:34:53,710
There you are.

1463
01:34:54,854 --> 01:34:56,014
Right.

1464
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:58,021
Where to?

1465
01:35:00,994 --> 01:35:02,359
Just drive.

1466
01:35:03,863 --> 01:35:05,558
You got it, Bob.

1467
01:35:08,902 --> 01:35:10,494
ANNA: Wait a minute.
Where's Louis?

1468
01:35:10,570 --> 01:35:12,697
DECLAN: Louis? He's fine.
Strapped him to the roof.

1469
01:35:12,772 --> 01:35:15,332
You strapped him to the roof?
He'll get filthy up there.

1470
01:35:15,408 --> 01:35:16,568
Don't worry.

1471
01:35:16,643 --> 01:35:19,237
We'll throw him in the
wash. He'll be grand.
