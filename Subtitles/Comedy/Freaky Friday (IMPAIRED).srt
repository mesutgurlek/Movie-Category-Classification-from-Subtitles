00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:18,901
What are you doing?
Get out of my room!

168
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:21,695
Help me!

169
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:25,824
Mommy!

170
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,992
Stop! Anna!

171
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,454
Sing it on the second verse.

172
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:32,455
There she is.

173
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:34,665
Hey!
What happened?

174
00:10:34,749 --> 00:10:37,126
Nothing.
Just taking care of my brother.

175
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,690
Thank you.

176
00:11:05,235 --> 00:11:06,736
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

177
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,989
Come here.
Oh, sweetheart.

178
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:11,157
All right. Ready?

179
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,117
I'm gonna give you three.

180
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,036
No. Ready?
One, two, three.

181
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,331
Oh, honey, go back inside.
I'll be right there.

182
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:21,416
Anna!

183
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,769
Hold still, honey, hold still.

184
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:45,897
I promise there will be
serious consequences for her.

185
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,649
Hey, Tessie!

186
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:50,068
Hey, Dad, you're early!

187
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:51,736
- What?
- You're early!

188
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,529
I can't...

189
00:11:53,571 --> 00:11:56,365
You're early.

190
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,617
Hold on.
I need my glasses.

191
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,868
Grandpa!

Hey, monkey!
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

193
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,958
What is this?
One of them thongs?

194
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,376
I don't want to know.

What's up?
What's up?

- Hey, guys.
- You guys know these yard apes?

197
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,966
You're early.

198
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,717
What?

199
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,969
Glad you could make it.

200
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,887
I brought
an early wedding present.

201
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:21,722
What?

202
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,267
I thought I'd get
the author to sign it.

203
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:26,935
What?

204
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:29,812
- I thought I'd ask...
- I can't hear you. Hold on.

205
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:31,314
Let's get out of here.

206
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:33,107
What do you have
under your shirt?

207
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,400
Ryan, could you?

208
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:16,939
- Oh, bummer.
- Not again.

209
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:19,441
Time's up!
It's after 6:00!

Mmm!

Hey, guys.

212
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,863
You're gonna spoil your dinner.

213
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:29,659
You know, this Dad thing
can be hard or easy.

214
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:35,789
Don't let her see you.

215
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,876
Good, now we can hear.

216
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,878
Speak for yourself.
I could use those little notes.

217
00:13:43,171 --> 00:13:46,174
She hates when I pull the plug.
Get ready for the fireworks.

218
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:47,300
Did I say hello?

219
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:48,676
I must have missed it.

220
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,137
- Hello.
- Hello.

221
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:54,223
Get a room!

222
00:13:57,267 --> 00:13:59,186

- Just one second. One second.

Okay, but you owe me.

226

Hello.

Yes, this is she.

Oh, really?

229
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:22,332
Okay.
Yeah, great.

Thank you so, so much.

You guys are never
gonna believe this.

One of the bands dropped out
of the Wango Tango auditions.

234

We are the first alternate.

235
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,677

How can you? Aren't you
the maid of horror or something?

It's the rehearsal.

out of the rehearsal,

out those Lakers.

Mom, did you see
what happened to my door?

270
00:16:10,014 --> 00:16:11,474
I spoke to your principal.

271
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:12,099
What?

272
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:13,684
Just now on the phone.

00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:14,727
Where's my door?

- Privacy is a privilege.
- Where is my door, Mom?

275
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,190
Your door will be
returned to you, Anna,

276
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:22,692
if and when you can explain...

277
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:25,653
You give me that door,
or I will kill myself.

I think we can dispense
with the drama.

282
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,788
Maybe you can
calmly explain to me

283
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,373
why you were
in detention twice today.

284
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,917
Okay, I went to detention.

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,626
That was
because Stacey Hinkhouse

286
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,670
kept hitting me
with a volleyball.

287
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:47,549
When is this conflict with
Stacey Hinkhouse going to end?

288
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,468
Never, because she's
an insane, psycho freak.

289
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,137
You'd know that if you paid
a speck of attention.

Anna!

291
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:54,847
What?

292
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,433
I think you know I pay
attention, Anna.

293
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,644
Enough to know that you got
an "F" in English today.

294
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,604
Well, Mr. Bates
is out to get me.

295
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:03,855
Oh, him too?

296
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,148
Yeah.

297
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,275
He just looks
for ways to torture me.

298
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:10,403
Like today, the one time Jake
spoke to me, he totally...

299

Who's Jake?

300
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:14,573
He's just nobody.

301
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,035
You say
I'm not interested, Anna.

302
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:21,079
I'm interested.
Try me.

303
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:24,708
Okay, he's just this
really amazing guy, Mom.

304
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,459
Where'd you meet him?

305
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,211
Detention, but...

306
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:29,796
That's promising.

307
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:31,297
Do you see? Why do I
bother telling you anything?

308
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:32,798
Do you see? Why do I
bother telling you anything?

309
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:35,509
Okay.
Who's up for Chinese?

310
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:37,845
Aah!
You're ruining my life!

311
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:42,641
I'm moving out and never coming
back ever, ever, ever again!

312
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:00,198
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello, Pei-Pei.

313
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,702
Anna, Harry, you're so big now.
What happened?

314
00:18:03,743 --> 00:18:05,370
Are you happy for your mommy?

315
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:06,871
About what?

316
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:09,707
Oh. [Laughs]
She's such a joker.

317
00:18:09,749 --> 00:18:12,209
Who's catering?
Chinese food good luck.

318
00:18:12,251 --> 00:18:15,546
- It's all planned already.
- Okay, how about me?

319
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:18,882
- I preordered the Peking duck.
- Joy.

320
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:21,718
- I know that's your favorite.
- Whatever.

321
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,262
- The wedding is in two days.
- Think about it.

322
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,056
See you soon.
Happy dining.

323
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:29,225
Anna, your door is
underneath the back stairs.

324
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:31,769
Like I didn't figure that out.

325
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:36,065
Stop groveling, man.
Let her come to you.

326
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,901
She'd come with a hatchet.

327
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,403
I think I'll
go check on that duck.

00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:50,411
Do you think
that your surliness

330
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,372
is the best way for you
to get what you want?

331
00:18:57,418 --> 00:18:59,086
I'm sorry, Mom.

332
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:01,338
I really have
been stressing in school,

333
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:05,300
and I deserved every single one
of those trips to detention.

334
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:09,095
And I'm gonna apologize to
Stacey Hinkhouse and Mr. Bates.

335
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:13,182
I guess what I'm trying to say
is, I'll try and do better, Mom.

336
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:15,351
I'll really, really try.

337
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:17,269
All right, what do you want?

338
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:19,188
To go to this audition tomorrow

339
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,023
that we can never have
again at the House of Blues.

340
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:22,566
An audition, that's great.

341
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:26,403
Tomorrow? You mean
after the rehearsal dinner?

342
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:28,905
Well, during.

343
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:31,782
"During."
You mean as "instead of"?

344
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:32,658
Technically?

345
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:34,452
I need to talk to you right now.

346
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:36,954
- I'm gonna pass on that.
- Now!

347
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:40,666
Anna.

348
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,210
I am going
to make one final attempt

349
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:46,754
to understand
what goes on in your head.

350
00:19:46,838 --> 00:19:48,631
Don't treat me like
your patients.

351
00:19:48,673 --> 00:19:50,550
- What?
- All calm and reasonable.

352
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:52,093
Let's talk.
I want to understand.

353
00:19:52,176 --> 00:19:55,262
I really do
want to understand, Anna!

354
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:56,138
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

355
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,975
Oh, Mama,
stay out of it, please.

356
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:01,560
- Mama.
- Okay, fine.

357
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:04,062
They're gonna pick one local
band to play at Wango Tango.

358
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:06,356
We were lucky to make this cut.

359
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,983
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
chance. Please.

360
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,985
Why can't I just go?
Please.

361
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:13,362
What I hear
is that my special night

362
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,406
means absolutely nothing to you.

363
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:18,242
I don't have to ask if my band
means anything to you.

364
00:20:18,325 --> 00:20:20,494
It's clear
you think we're all noise.

365
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,537
Look, I'm a walrus.

366
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:25,832
- I do not!
- Do too!

367
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:29,961
Anna, I let you practice
in the garage.

368
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,170
Anna, stop.

369
00:20:31,212 --> 00:20:32,880
What?

370
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:35,341
Let's talk about what
this is really about.

371
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:37,092
This is about your dad.

372
00:20:37,176 --> 00:20:40,762
Mom, stop shrinking me.
It's not about Dad.

373
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:43,640
It's about the audition!
You're ruining my life!

374
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:45,433
Enough with the drama.

375
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:47,852
Anna, high school
is not that hard.

376
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:50,688
You couldn't last one day
in my high school.

377
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:54,316
I could, and I would do it
without getting a detention.

378
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,528
I'm sorry I'm the one thing
in your life that isn't perfect!

379
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,696
You think my life is perfect?

380
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:01,448
I know your life is perfect.

381
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:02,949
Your perfect job,
perfect boyfriend,

382
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:05,368
perfect patients who worship
the ground you walk on.

383
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,496
You need a serious
and bracing reality check

384
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:10,373
if you think my life is perfect!

385
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:12,625
You can cut me some
slack this once.

386
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:15,085
I am beyond
cutting you slack, Anna.

387
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:17,129
You are not
going to the audition.

388
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:18,464
- I am!
- No, you're not!

389
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:21,299
- Why not?
- Because I said so!

390
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:23,093
Cookie?

391
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:28,139
This isn't really a good time.

392
00:21:28,223 --> 00:21:30,058
Now a good time.

393
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:32,393
[Speaking Chinese]

394
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:40,609
Okay, okay.
Thank you.

395
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:49,200
Anna, for one day,
the entirety of our life

396
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:51,285
is not gonna be
focused on you.

397
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:54,163
Yeah, it's all about
Ryan now, isn't it?

398
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:56,582
Anna!

399
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,125
Get away.

400
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,585
Honey!

401
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:15,099
"A journey soon begins,

402
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:18,227
its prize reflected
in another's eyes.

403
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,437
When what you see
is what you lack,

404
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,773
then selfless love
will change you back."

405
00:22:23,815 --> 00:22:24,858
Whatever.

406
00:22:37,244 --> 00:22:38,537
Honey?

407
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,331
- You okay?
- Yeah.

408
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:43,083
Whew.

409
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:44,459
Come on.

410
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,520
- Did you feel that?
- Feel what?

411
00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:07,814
- There was an earthquake.
- No, there wasn't.

412
00:23:07,897 --> 00:23:09,190
Yes, there was.

413
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:10,983
What are they talking about?

414
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:12,318
An earthquake.

415
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,277
An earthquake?

416
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:15,654
No.
There was no earthquake.

417
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:17,239
You didn't feel it?

418
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:21,284
No.
I don't think so.

419
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:12,581
6:45 already.

420
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:15,834
Oh, God, I didn't get
the dry cleaning.

421
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:18,754
I'll have to do that on the way
home, and call the mechanic

422
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:20,797
and the florist.

423
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:24,718
Okay, better get up.

424
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,594
I'd better...

425
00:24:29,138 --> 00:24:32,892
Why am I in Anna's room?

426
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:35,102
What happened last night?

427
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:37,855
Did I pass out in here?

428
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:40,565
Oh, I have no memory of this!

429
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:42,609
This isn't mine!

430
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,987
Those aren't mine!

431
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:47,697
That's not mine.

432
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,369
That's definitely not mine.

433
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:00,626
Aaaaah!

434
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:03,003
Anna, come here quick.

435
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,421
Mom's dead.

436
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,797
I'm dead?

437
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,928
Come on, hurry!

438
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,434
See?
She's not moving.

439
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,770
Oh, my God.

440
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,522
No, wait, it's breathing.

441
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,690
I'm not dead.

442
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,108
What?

443
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:34,240
Right.
Her chest is moving, honey, see?

444
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:37,242
You called me "honey."

445
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:38,786
Right...

446
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:41,121
Are you sick?

447
00:25:41,163 --> 00:25:42,581
I hope so.

448
00:25:42,664 --> 00:25:45,291
Or dreaming.

449
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,001
Hon.

450
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:49,295
Harry,
go get your own breakfast.

451
00:25:49,337 --> 00:25:51,464
You can eat Anna's cereal.

452
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:52,506
My cereal.

453
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,883
Cool.

454
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:00,430
Hello?

455
00:26:01,932 --> 00:26:04,059
Hello in there?

456
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,227
Wake up, honey.

457
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:08,187
Wake up.

458
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:10,148
Wake up!

459
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:11,691
That is it.

460
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:13,567
[Groaning] Oh.

461
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:30,083
Oh, could I just have,
like, one minute, please?

462
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,168
Honey.

463
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:35,171
Look, I think
something's happened to us.

464
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:37,673
What are you?

465
00:26:37,715 --> 00:26:40,008
It's me. Mom.

466
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,510
You're not my mother.

467
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:44,346
Yes, I am.

468
00:26:44,387 --> 00:26:46,014
Get away, you clone freak!

469
00:26:46,056 --> 00:26:49,100
Don't you use that tone with me.

470
00:26:49,183 --> 00:26:51,352
Oh, my God, you are my mother.

471
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:54,021
And you're not
who you think you are.

472
00:27:02,612 --> 00:27:04,155
Look at me!

473
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:05,907
We seem to be inside each other.

474
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,742
I'm old!

475
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:09,452
I beg your pardon!

476
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:12,371
Oh, I'm like the Cryptkeeper!

477
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:14,457
Okay, that's enough.

478
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,503
Aah!

479
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:21,088
I want my body back.

480
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:24,049
And I don't want mine?
My wedding's tomorrow.

481
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,092
Oh, my God!
My wedding's tomorrow.

482
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:28,428
I can't marry Ryan.
Ew!

483
00:27:28,511 --> 00:27:30,972
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

484
00:27:31,055 --> 00:27:32,598
Okay what?

485
00:27:32,682 --> 00:27:34,141
I have no idea.

486
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:37,102
Mom, maybe we should go
to the emergency room.

487
00:27:37,186 --> 00:27:37,770
Oh, no.

488
00:27:37,853 --> 00:27:40,105
All that will get us
is a 72-hour lockdown

489
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:42,441
in the psych ward
and a Thorazine drip.

490
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:44,901
No, we're not going anywhere.

491
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:45,819
Okay.

492
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:51,616
So you're in my body,
and I'm in your body.

493
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:52,908
Why don't we, like...

494
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,369
Yes, yes, I see
what you're saying.

495
00:27:55,452 --> 00:27:56,745
A jolt.

496
00:27:56,829 --> 00:27:59,831
Okay. You go over there,
and I go over here.

497
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:03,043
Okay, now when I say go.
Ready?

498
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:04,961
- Yeah.
- Go.

499
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,505
Hey, Mom, can I...

500
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:13,803
Okay.
Okay, that was stupid.

501
00:28:15,054 --> 00:28:17,181
Harry!

502
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:21,560
I was just teaching
Mom some new dance moves.

503
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:23,562
What do you want, punk?

504
00:28:27,065 --> 00:28:29,067
You cannot talk to him
like that.

505
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,443
He thinks you're his mother.

506
00:28:30,485 --> 00:28:32,612
We're gonna to have to tell him.

507
00:28:32,653 --> 00:28:35,447
We're not going to tell anyone.

508
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:37,825
They'll think we're crazy.

509
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:39,535
Maybe we are crazy.

510
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,161
I for one am not crazy.

511
00:28:41,244 --> 00:28:44,956
I'm merely a grown woman
trapped in my daughter's body.

512
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,876
Oh, God, I am crazy.

513
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,683
Grandpa,
could you pass the milk?

514
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:09,103
Okay. Harry's still Harry,
and Grandpa's still Grandpa.

515
00:29:09,187 --> 00:29:11,314
So it's just us.
What did we do wrong?

516
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:12,231
I don't know.

517
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:15,776
Grandpa, pass the milk!

518
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,903
Grandpa, pass the milk!

519
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:18,987
Earthquake.

520
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:20,530
Earthquake!

521
00:29:20,614 --> 00:29:21,615
Earthquake?

522
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:22,741
House of Chang!

523
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:25,118
- Nobody felt it but us.
- Earthquake!

524
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:28,329
Earthquake, earthquake!

525
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:29,872
Honey!

526
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:34,376
Okay.

527
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,045
I'll take you.

528
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:40,507
I guess you're not ready yet.

529
00:29:43,802 --> 00:29:45,970
Sweetheart.

530
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:47,388
What are you doing here?

531
00:29:47,472 --> 00:29:50,349
I thought you said
you needed a ride to work.

532
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:52,893
Right, Mom.

533
00:29:52,977 --> 00:29:55,062
I guess you better hurry up.

534
00:29:55,146 --> 00:29:56,897
Get a grip.
I am not...

535
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:04,029
Darling.

536
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:08,449
Could you,
like, chill for a sec?

537
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:12,995
Sure, sure, I'll chill.

538
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,373
- You're going.
- I'll, like, go get your dad.

539
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:19,001
Alan, that's not our car!

540
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:21,712
The earthquake and then
Pei-Pei's crazy mother

541
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:23,213
pointing at me and you.

542
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,882
And what was she
mumbling about in Chinese?

543
00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:29,552
She did something.
Some strange Asian voodoo.

544
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:32,888
What are we gonna do now?
I can't go to school like this.

545
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:33,889
You have to.

546
00:30:33,973 --> 00:30:35,891
You're on the verge
of suspension,

547
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:38,936
and you have your honors
qualifying exam today.

548
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:41,646
All the more reason
to stay home.

549
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:45,066
I could go and
take the exam for you.

550
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,777
I'm sure a high test
would be simple for me.

551
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,405
Are you kidding?
You think you can be me?

552
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:53,532
Of course I can.
Watch me.

553
00:30:53,616 --> 00:30:57,536
"Oh, everyone's out to get me.
You're ruining my life."

554
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:58,912
It's easy to be you.

555
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:00,956
I'll suck the fun
out of everything.

556
00:31:00,998 --> 00:31:02,666
I do not suck the fun
out of everything.

557
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:04,751
- Fun sucker.
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

558
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:08,129
I will go to school,
and you will stay right...

559
00:31:08,212 --> 00:31:09,756
- What?
- Evan.

560
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,633
- Evan? Who's Evan?
- My neediest patient.

561
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:15,177
I've been seeing him every day
for three years.

562
00:31:15,261 --> 00:31:16,720
Ooh, bummer.

563
00:31:17,721 --> 00:31:20,223
Maybe just my face
would be reassuring.

564
00:31:20,307 --> 00:31:21,391
No way. Unh-unh.

565
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:25,103
I am not babysitting
some 40-year-old wack job.

566
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:26,813
What am I supposed
to say to the freak?

567
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:30,525
Nothing. You are in no way
to give anyone any advice.

568
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:31,609
That would be unethical.

569
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:34,570
Just listen attentively,
nod occasionally,

570
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:36,530
and if you must speak,
simply say,

571
00:31:36,614 --> 00:31:39,158
"How do you feel about that?"

572
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,034
You're serious.

573
00:31:41,118 --> 00:31:43,662
You really
want us to be each other?

574
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:46,539
We will get through
this morning as each other,

575
00:31:46,623 --> 00:31:49,459
and we will go to the restaurant
at lunch and get switched back.

576
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:50,960
Go get dressed.

577
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:54,672
Well, good luck getting
dressed without a door.

578
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,675
Thank you.

Oh, boy.

581
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:05,140
You'll get used to it.

582
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,474
What?

583
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:08,184
You pierced your navel?

584
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:11,270
Yeah. I meant to talk
to you about that.

585
00:32:11,354 --> 00:32:14,773
- When did you do this?
- At Maddie's cousin's sweet 16.

586
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:18,152
Well, when you get
your body back, it's grounded.

587
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:19,653
And what are you doing?

588
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:22,405
I don't know why you never wear
these. They're cute.

589
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:26,326
Yeah, if you're selling Bibles.
And what did you do to my hair?

590
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:28,870
I've been dying
to comb these rats out.

Now you can see
your pretty face.

And what is this?

593
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,708
Oh, I fixed your jeans.

My patients are not
going to pay $ 150 an hour

to get therapy from a stripper.

596
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:40,505
All right.
I'll drab up.

597
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:41,757
I'll grunge down.

598
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,049
Go.

Excuse me.

608
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:17,664
And while I'm apologizing,
let me just say to the whole car

how truly sorry I am

610

for being such an insane
control freak all the time.

611
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:24,713
You're not controlling, Mom.

612
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,840
I'm the one
who should be apologizing

613
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:29,884
for my flagrant disregard for
anyone's feelings but my own.

Well, at least you have
a great sense of style.

- Enough.

Don't even think about it.

How quickly I've been
able to get over it.

Just pull up here.

00:35:29,952 --> 00:35:33,039
I mean I'm allowed
because I'm old.

655
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:36,500
I gotta go.

656
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,377
Bye.

657
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,254
Walk with him.

658
00:35:46,551 --> 00:35:49,721
Harry, do you know who that is?

659
00:35:49,804 --> 00:35:51,806
Anna's got a boyfriend.

660
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:54,850
K-l-S-S-l-N-G.

661
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:58,562
Okay, where are we going next?
Harry's school?

662
00:36:00,314 --> 00:36:02,023
Oh, he can walk from here.

663
00:36:02,065 --> 00:36:04,109
It's 20 blocks!

664
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:05,693
Fresh air will do you good.

665
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:07,487
What about bullies?

666
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,571
Run fast.

667
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:12,241
Tess, look, really, it's
no trouble to drive him.

668
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:13,951
Whatever.

669
00:36:22,417 --> 00:36:25,170
Hey, I've got The Hives for you.

670
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:26,880
I beg your pardon?

671
00:36:26,963 --> 00:36:29,340
- The CD.
- Oh, yeah, that.

672
00:36:29,424 --> 00:36:31,050
They're coming
to town next week.

673
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:33,219
- I was wondering if...
- That's a nice thought.

674
00:36:33,302 --> 00:36:35,846
I'm sure with a haircut
you'd look presentable.

675
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,723
But I need to focus
on my schoolwork,

676
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:40,309
and truth be told,
you're way too old for me.

677
00:36:40,392 --> 00:36:42,602
But thanks anyway, Jason.

678
00:36:44,437 --> 00:36:45,855
It's Jake.

679
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:51,986
Hello.
Good morning.

680
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:53,738
Good morning.
Hi.

681
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:54,905
Hello.

682
00:36:56,824 --> 00:36:59,117
Stacey!
Hi, how are you?

683
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:01,078
Oh, wonderful.

684
00:37:03,538 --> 00:37:06,124
Stacey, what are you doing?

685
00:37:10,169 --> 00:37:11,921
Run away.

686
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,216
- Are you okay, Anna?
- God!

687
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,135
I am appalled Stacey
would do something like that.

688
00:37:18,218 --> 00:37:19,219
Yeah, shocker.

689
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,139
Oh, I am going
to be calling her mother.

690
00:37:22,222 --> 00:37:24,933
Forget about that.
We'll get her later.

691
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:25,809
We saw you.

692
00:37:25,892 --> 00:37:27,518
- Saw me what?
- With Jake.

693
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,854
- Give us the dirty details.
- Excuse me?

694
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:30,980
Did you make a move?

695
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:34,900
- Is that something I would do?
- It's something you should do.

696
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:36,318
No, no, no.

697
00:37:36,402 --> 00:37:38,779
I don't believe
in physical contact

698
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:41,531
with the opposite sex
at all, ever.

699
00:37:41,615 --> 00:37:42,532
Nothing.

700
00:37:42,616 --> 00:37:46,035
And you girls would do
well to follow my example.

701
00:37:58,338 --> 00:37:59,548
Well.

702
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:02,050
- Whoa, whoa!
- What?

703
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:03,677
Cold sore, cold sore.

704
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,762
- Where?
- I feel it coming on there.

705
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:07,305
- Big oozer.
- I don't care.

706
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,599
I'm thinking of you, really.

707
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:10,892
You.

708
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:13,686
Okay. Okay.

709
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:16,146
Good thing, I guess.

710
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,566
You need a ride home, or are you
gonna pick up the Volvo?

711
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,987
Oh, I will most definitely
be picking up the Volvo.

712
00:39:17,953 --> 00:39:20,580
Ow!

713
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:34,718
Hey. How's it going?

714
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,596
- Uh! What?

715
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,369
Dr. Coleman's office.

716
00:40:02,452 --> 00:40:04,162
Hi.
This is Dr. Dunn's office.

717
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:06,748
I am calling to confirm
your root canal appointment.

718
00:40:06,831 --> 00:40:07,749
Root canal?

719
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,917
That's not fair!
They're not my teeth.

720
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:12,128
Okay, I'm not sure...

721
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,755
No.
No, I'm cutting the dentist.

722
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:17,257
- You mean you're canceling?
- Yeah, cancel.

723
00:40:17,341 --> 00:40:20,302
Like I'm going to take
that bullet. Please!

724
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:25,598
Evan.

725
00:40:25,682 --> 00:40:28,768
No. Boris.

726
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:29,977
Line 27.

727
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:32,104
- Thanks.
- There you go.

728
00:40:35,107 --> 00:40:38,318
Whoa!
She's blind!

729
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,779
Oh, this sucks.

730
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:41,822
Wanna get that?

731
00:40:41,905 --> 00:40:45,533
No way. I'm not answering
that thing again.

732
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:46,534
Good to see you.

733
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:47,869
Okay.

734
00:40:51,747 --> 00:40:53,207
You're here.

735
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:57,252
Oh.
Yeah, I'm here, and you're here.

736
00:40:57,336 --> 00:40:58,795
You look fantastic.

737
00:40:58,837 --> 00:41:00,464
Why?
Are you canceling the session?

738
00:41:00,547 --> 00:41:01,465
No, Kevin.

739
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:02,340
Evan!

740
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:04,634
Evan. Evan.

741
00:41:04,718 --> 00:41:07,512
So, shall we go in here
and do it?

742
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:10,306
Are you gonna get that?

743
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:11,724
No.

744
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:14,310
Oh, so you
don't answer your phone.

745
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:17,271
I told you I wouldn't be able
to call you on your honeymoon,

746
00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:18,814
but you lied to me.

747
00:41:18,897 --> 00:41:20,315
You're a liar!

748
00:41:20,399 --> 00:41:21,441
I'll get it.

749
00:41:22,526 --> 00:41:23,526
Yo.

750
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:26,154
What?

751
00:41:26,905 --> 00:41:29,615
$ 10,000? For what?

752
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:31,909
Halibut!
Ew!

753
00:41:31,993 --> 00:41:34,328
What kind of caterer are you?

754
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:36,664
It's disgusting.

755
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:39,291
Well, I'm not gonna pay for it.

756
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:42,669
Okay, fine. Don't show up.
See if I care.

757
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:45,046
Yeah, I'm canceling.

758
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,882
Yeah, well, same to you, dude.

759
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:49,509
So, Ethan.

760
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:50,510
Evan!

761
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:52,928
Evan.
I knew that.

762
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:04,147
Bates. I've seen him before.
Where have I seen him before?

763
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,192
Like, every day
in this torture chamber.

764
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,068
So, did you talk to your mom?

765
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:14,031
Today is a lovely day
for a pop quiz.

766
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:19,244
All of you should have finished
reading "Hamlet" by now.

767
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,913
I'm going to ask each
one of you one question,

768
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,000
and you will be graded
according to your answer.

769
00:42:25,083 --> 00:42:28,961
Oh, thank God it's "Hamlet."
I was in that play in high...

770
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,756
I just know the play.

771
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,090
Like that'll help you.

772
00:42:33,174 --> 00:42:37,428
Mr. Waters, describe
the character of Hamlet.

773
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:43,558
Hamlet.

774
00:42:43,642 --> 00:42:47,103
He's, uh...
he's one of the big characters.

775
00:42:47,145 --> 00:42:48,730
I mean, he's Hamlet.

776
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:55,986
He's just bopping around,
doesn't know which way's up.

777
00:42:57,571 --> 00:43:01,074
I don't think
the guy's got a clue.

778
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:05,370
You mean to say
that he is a man...

779
00:43:05,453 --> 00:43:06,121
Yeah.

780
00:43:06,204 --> 00:43:10,541
Who couldn't make up his...

781
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:12,793
- mind.
- Mind.

782
00:43:12,877 --> 00:43:14,295
Exactly.

783
00:43:14,378 --> 00:43:14,962
Very good.

784
00:43:15,045 --> 00:43:16,297
All right.

785
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,298
- "B."
- Yeah.

786
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:22,260
Ms. Coleman.

787
00:43:22,344 --> 00:43:23,428
Yes, Mr. Bates?

788
00:43:23,511 --> 00:43:27,098
What are the central
conflicts in "Hamlet"?

789
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,183
Well, political, of course,

790
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:31,435
because Claudius usurped
his father's throne.

791
00:43:31,477 --> 00:43:34,438
Oedipal, because of the
undercurrents with his mother.

792
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,774
Then there is the timeless
question of insanity.

793
00:43:36,857 --> 00:43:42,487
Is he really seeing his father's
ghost, or is he simply mad?

794
00:43:42,571 --> 00:43:47,575
That is seriously overreaching.

795
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:48,534
"F."

796
00:43:48,618 --> 00:43:50,369
- "F"?
- "F."

797
00:43:50,453 --> 00:43:53,581
Mr. Franelli, who is Fortinbras?

798
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,624
I started reading your new book,

799
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:59,962
and it just makes me feel
really depressed.

800
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:04,466
And how do you feel about that?

801
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,135
Depressed.

802
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,805
[Mumbling incoherently]

803
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,481
And how do you feel about that?

804
00:44:26,694 --> 00:44:29,697
She and her best friend
aren't speaking, Doctor.

805
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:33,284
And in her diary,
she keeps mentioning this boy.

806
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:35,077
How do you feel about that?

807
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,120
Well, I'm worried.

808
00:44:36,203 --> 00:44:37,996
You read her diaries?

809
00:44:38,038 --> 00:44:40,165
Oh, that's gross!

810
00:44:40,248 --> 00:44:42,667
That's bad.
"Bad Mom" award.

811
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:46,713
But I'm concerned, Doctor,
that she and this boy might be,

812
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:48,172
I mean, you know.

813
00:44:48,256 --> 00:44:50,091
Stop! Stop!

814
00:44:50,174 --> 00:44:52,677
Nothing is going on
between her and this guy.

815
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,554
If there was, she wouldn't be
writing about it.

816
00:44:55,638 --> 00:44:57,222
She'd be out there doing it.

817
00:44:57,347 --> 00:44:59,600
Her best friend
probably isn't talking to her

818
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:01,643
because she probably
likes this guy, too.

819
00:45:01,727 --> 00:45:04,104
And he probably flirted
with her a little,

820
00:45:04,187 --> 00:45:05,397
but he secretly
likes your daughter.

821
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,982
He hasn't made his move yet
because that wouldn't be cool.

822
00:45:08,066 --> 00:45:11,694
So now her best friend is
acting like some psycho freak.

823
00:45:11,777 --> 00:45:12,903
Okay?

824
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:16,365
That's very interesting.

825
00:45:16,407 --> 00:45:18,659
I never would have
thought about it that way.

826
00:45:18,742 --> 00:45:20,661
Cool.
Guess we're done.

827
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:30,586
Mr. Bates, may I please
speak with you?

828
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,090
I think that would be fairly
pointless, but go ahead.

829
00:45:34,173 --> 00:45:37,676
By what stretch
of the imagination...

830
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,263
I mean, like, how could I,
like, get an "F"?

831
00:45:41,346 --> 00:45:42,722
What mistakes did I make?

832
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,557
Grading is subjective.

833
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,476
That was
a college-level analysis.

834
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,896
And you're qualified
to make that assessment?

835
00:45:49,937 --> 00:45:51,147
I most certainly am.

836
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:55,609
Well, in the words of Hamlet,
"What's done is done."

837
00:45:55,693 --> 00:45:59,196
That's "Macbeth,"
you know-nothing twit.

840
00:46:03,116 --> 00:46:04,743
How do you know that?

841
00:46:04,784 --> 00:46:07,829
Well, you asked me,
I mean, my mom to the prom,

842
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:09,664
but she turned you down.

843
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:11,749
This is not
an appropriate subject.

844
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:14,251
You're taking it out
on her daughter, aren't you?

845
00:46:14,293 --> 00:46:15,920
I don't know
what you're talking about.

846
00:46:16,003 --> 00:46:17,755
It was a high school dance.

847
00:46:17,796 --> 00:46:20,257
You've got to let it
go and move on, man.

848
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:23,843
And if you don't, I'm sure the
school board would love to hear

849
00:46:23,927 --> 00:46:28,139
about your pathetic vendetta
against an innocent student.

850
00:46:28,222 --> 00:46:30,224
Oh, and by the way, Elton,

851
00:46:30,308 --> 00:46:34,395
she had a boyfriend,
and you were weird.

852
00:46:36,272 --> 00:46:39,775
That was amazing.
You totally destroyed him.

853
00:46:39,858 --> 00:46:42,611
I don't think Elton Bates
will be giving me much trouble.

854
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:44,154
That's so weird about your mom.

855
00:46:44,237 --> 00:46:46,322
- Oh, yeah, what did she say?
- About what?

856
00:46:46,406 --> 00:46:49,409
- About the audition.
- Oh, right. She said no.

857
00:46:49,492 --> 00:46:51,035
What?

858
00:46:51,827 --> 00:46:53,662
Well, it is
her rehearsal dinner.

859
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:56,498
Don't you think
that's rather important, too?

860
00:46:56,582 --> 00:46:57,958
And you told her?

861
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,335
You told her this chance
would never come again?

862
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:02,879
- She sympathizes.
- Don't give us this.

863
00:47:02,963 --> 00:47:04,839
She is totally
ruining our lives.

864
00:47:04,923 --> 00:47:06,257
You're the culprit.

865
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:09,135
Yeah, your mom
has never cared about our music.

866
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:10,178
Never cared?

867
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:11,262
Never cared?

868
00:47:11,345 --> 00:47:13,389
Who do you think paid
for those guitar lessons?

869
00:47:13,472 --> 00:47:16,183
And did she ever hear
a "thank you"? No.

870
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:17,810
Come on, you said it yourself.

871
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:19,853
Your mom hasn't paid
attention to you

872
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,105
since she started
dating that guy.

873
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:23,106
That's not true.

874
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,941
Well, you talk about it enough.

875
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:25,984
I do?

876
00:47:26,067 --> 00:47:28,069
What is up with you today?

877
00:47:28,152 --> 00:47:30,988
You act like you don't even
care about this band.

878
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,700
Look, girls... guys,
if it were any other night.

879
00:47:34,783 --> 00:47:37,202
Whatever, Anna.

Get out of the car.
I'm driving.

886
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:09,357
Oh, my God.
What have you done to me?

887
00:48:09,399 --> 00:48:10,608
Do you like it?

888
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:13,527
Get out of the car right now!

It's gone!

What have you done to my ear?

893
00:48:25,914 --> 00:48:27,373
Mom, it's an earring!

894
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:28,916

No.

are going back tomorrow!

00:48:34,088 --> 00:48:36,090
Why? Everyone likes them.
You look great.

899

Why not?

904

go down your throat

to us at your restaurant.

the fortune cookie?

00:52:21,421 --> 00:52:23,298
He is a sweet boy.

978
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:27,218
But he's having a little
trouble with bullies.

979
00:52:27,302 --> 00:52:28,761
So?

980
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,722
That's character-building.
Kid needs to toughen up.

981
00:52:31,806 --> 00:52:34,266
He's kind of a wimp.

982
00:52:34,308 --> 00:52:36,268
So, that's it?
I can go?

983
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:38,896
No, not exactly.

984
00:52:38,979 --> 00:52:40,397
Harry's very bright,

985
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,983
but he's having a
problem applying himself,

986
00:52:43,066 --> 00:52:44,317
particularly in Math.

987
00:52:44,401 --> 00:52:45,610
So, hold him back.

988
00:52:45,652 --> 00:52:47,195
I mean, he's short.

989
00:52:47,278 --> 00:52:49,489
He'll fit in,
you know what I mean?

990
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,743
Well, you know,
he's very good in English.

991
00:52:53,826 --> 00:52:56,870
I had the class write an essay
on who they admire most,

992
00:52:56,954 --> 00:53:01,124
and he wrote a wonderful
paper about your daughter.

993
00:53:21,393 --> 00:53:23,436
So, what'd she say?

994
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,855
She showed me the paper
you wrote about Anna.

995
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:27,815
- You saw that?
- Mm-hmm.

996
00:53:27,857 --> 00:53:29,984
Well, don't tell her I like her.

997
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:31,068
Well, why not?

998
00:53:31,152 --> 00:53:34,238
Because we have
too much fun fighting.

999
00:53:38,325 --> 00:53:42,704
You know, kid, you are way more
twisted than I thought.

1000
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:48,251
Good try!

1001
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:49,710
- Oh, man!
- Loser!

1002
00:53:51,754 --> 00:53:53,381
Good luck flunking.

1003
00:53:54,215 --> 00:53:57,509
Stacey, I want to talk to you.
Come here.

1004
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,512
Why this falling out?

1005
00:54:00,554 --> 00:54:02,848
We were best friends
in sixth grade.

1006
00:54:02,889 --> 00:54:04,933
I know I got
involved with my music,

1007
00:54:05,016 --> 00:54:06,935
and you became involved
with your cheerleading,

1008
00:54:07,018 --> 00:54:09,228
but why does this
have to be World War III?

1009
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,188
All those years

1010
00:54:10,271 --> 00:54:13,024
of trick-or-treating
and sleepovers.

1011
00:54:13,107 --> 00:54:15,859
Don't you remember any of it?
I know I do.

1012
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:18,862
I mean, how do you
feel about that?

1013
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:22,699
All right, let's all
take our seats for the test.

1014
00:54:23,742 --> 00:54:25,869
Sit with me?

1015
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:28,621
Communication.
That's all it takes.

1016
00:54:30,623 --> 00:54:32,875
Hey, there you are.

1017
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:34,210
Ooh! You again.

1018
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:36,086
Look at you.

1019
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:38,672
Love the hair.

1020
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:41,258
Got a surprise.
You're gonna be happy with me.

1021
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:42,634
I seriously doubt that.

1022
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:44,594
Great dress. Sexy.

1023
00:54:44,678 --> 00:54:45,929
Oozing sore!

1024
00:54:46,012 --> 00:54:47,388
I don't see anything.

1025
00:54:48,765 --> 00:54:49,891
Makeup! Great stuff!

1026
00:54:49,974 --> 00:54:53,185
Hey, take it easy, stud.
Save it for the honeymoon.

1027
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:55,854
You know what?
We have to go anyway.

1028
00:54:55,938 --> 00:54:58,565
Oh, no, I have to get
that fortune thingy.

1029
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:00,484
No time.
I've got my sweater on.

1030
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:02,110
No, no.
I have to...

1031
00:55:02,194 --> 00:55:04,696
We have to leave.
We'll spoil the surprise.

1032
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:04,863
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

1033
00:55:04,863 --> 00:55:06,072
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

1034
00:55:06,156 --> 00:55:07,574
- Watch your step.
- Okay!

1035
00:55:07,615 --> 00:55:10,409
- Still got your eyes closed?
- Yeah.

1036
00:55:10,493 --> 00:55:13,162
All right, okay, relax.
Open them.

1037
00:55:14,705 --> 00:55:16,415
You're on
"The Dottie Robertson Show."

1038
00:55:16,498 --> 00:55:19,042
They had
a last-second cancellation.

1039
00:55:19,126 --> 00:55:20,711
I got you on.

1040
00:55:20,794 --> 00:55:22,129
To talk about that book?

1041
00:55:22,212 --> 00:55:23,505
Break a leg.

1042
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:25,090
I didn't want to say anything.

1043
00:55:25,173 --> 00:55:26,633
We're ready for you now.

1044
00:55:26,716 --> 00:55:28,426
I know you get nervous,
but you're gonna be great.

1045
00:55:28,468 --> 00:55:30,261
I'm gonna barf!

1046
00:55:30,344 --> 00:55:31,679
Go get 'em!

1047
00:55:32,388 --> 00:55:35,140
- Watch your step. This way.
- I'm sorry.

1048
00:55:35,224 --> 00:55:37,559
- I'm not that person.
- Right there.

1049
00:55:37,643 --> 00:55:39,478
There you go.
Oh, sorry.

1050
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:43,440
Now, makeup's gonna
come to you, sweetie, okay?

1051
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:44,482
What is this thing?

1052
00:55:44,524 --> 00:55:47,235
"Through the Looking Glass.
Senescence."

1053
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:50,571
Se-nes-cence?
Seeny-sincey?

1054
00:55:50,655 --> 00:55:52,281
What?

1055
00:55:54,909 --> 00:55:56,994
"The sum of
the areas of the shaded regions

1056
00:55:57,077 --> 00:55:59,997
in terms of 'D' is equal to
A, 'D' squared times the sum

1057
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,999
of pi divided by four minus
'D' divided by two.

1058
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:05,752
B, 'D' squared
times the sum of pi cubed

1059
00:56:05,835 --> 00:56:07,420
divided by 'D' minus two."

1060
00:56:07,503 --> 00:56:10,381
Now, what is pi again?
Three-point-something?

1061
00:56:10,465 --> 00:56:12,967
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I've never used pi.

1062
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:16,553
Anna's never gonna use pi!
Why is it called pi anyway?

1063
00:56:16,637 --> 00:56:18,263
Okay, focus.

1064
00:56:18,347 --> 00:56:21,683
Or "C, 'D' cubed minus
the sum of pi squared.

1065
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:23,059
Psst!

1066
00:56:28,231 --> 00:56:31,150
Miss Brown,
she's copying my test!

1067
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:00,844
- Hey, cheater.
- I did not cheat.

1068
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,929
That Stacey Hinkhouse
is conniving.

1069
00:57:03,013 --> 00:57:04,306
It's your business.

1070
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:07,725
I did not cheat.
Don't you smirk at me.

1071
00:57:07,809 --> 00:57:08,726
If you're so perfect,

1072
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,561
why are you
in detention all the time?

1073
00:57:10,645 --> 00:57:13,814
I'm not in detention.
I work here.

1074
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:19,570
What would you say if I told you
I could help finish your test?

1075
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,696
Really?

1076
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:23,949
Yeah.

1077
00:57:24,032 --> 00:57:27,285
You know, my publisher doesn't
think anybody's gonna know

1078
00:57:27,368 --> 00:57:29,829
what the word
"senescence" means.

1079
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:31,122
Do you know what it means?

1080
00:57:31,205 --> 00:57:32,832
No.
Please do sit still.

1081
00:57:32,915 --> 00:57:34,375
Okay.

1082
00:57:37,169 --> 00:57:40,630
All right, they keep
the tests in the file room.

1083
00:57:40,714 --> 00:57:42,799
We're going through here?

1084
00:57:42,883 --> 00:57:46,761
They're so burned out
they won't notice. Trust me.

1085
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:15,371
All right, all right, all right.
Coleman.

1086
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:18,373
Anna Coleman.

1087
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:20,625
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

1088
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:23,795
Now hurry up
and finish your test.

1089
00:58:23,878 --> 00:58:26,881
You really are something, Jake.

1090
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:28,466
I'll watch the door.

1091
00:58:29,592 --> 00:58:31,427
Back from commercial in 10.

1092
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:35,014
Loved your book.
I actually read this one.

1093
00:58:35,848 --> 00:58:37,391
That makes one of us.

1094
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:42,104
Ready and three, two.

1095
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:44,147
Hi. Welcome back.

1096
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,065
We're here with
Dr. Tess Coleman,

1097
00:58:46,149 --> 00:58:48,318
author of
"Through the Looking Glass,

1098
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:50,361
Senescence in Retrograde."

1099
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,489
So, Doctor, tell us
about your new book.

1100
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,952
Well.

1101
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,372
I wrote it.

1102
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,041
Yes, you did.

1103
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,378
But tell us,
what got you interested

1104
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:12,548
in the physical and
intellectual exhaustion

1105
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:14,383
that seems to overcome
those of us

1106
00:59:14,466 --> 00:59:17,845
who are, let's say,
no longer 20.

1107
00:59:19,596 --> 00:59:22,390
Senescence, like senile!

1108
00:59:22,474 --> 00:59:23,808
Old people!

1109
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:25,435
Got it!
Got it!

1110
00:59:26,186 --> 00:59:30,314
And let's face it,
we are tired much of the time.

1111
00:59:30,398 --> 00:59:32,775
That's why I've been craving
caffeine all day.

1112
00:59:32,858 --> 00:59:34,818
I thought I was dying.

1113
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:10,268
But you still haven't answered
the fundamental question.

1114
01:00:10,351 --> 01:00:14,021
Why are we so tired?

1115
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:17,357
Well, of course we're tired

1116
01:00:17,399 --> 01:00:21,862
because of our demanding
and hectic...

1117
01:00:24,739 --> 01:00:28,409
Do you want to know why adults
are so tired all the time?

1118
01:00:28,493 --> 01:00:30,369
Because they spend
their time obsessing

1119
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:33,873
about these stupid, lame things
they don't really have to do.

1120
01:00:33,914 --> 01:00:35,040
Like cooking.

1121
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:37,376
I mean, have you never
heard of takeout?

1122
01:00:37,418 --> 01:00:39,628
And cleaning?

1123
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:41,588
Let's don't and say we did!

1124
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:45,467
And quality time with your kids?
You know what?

1125
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,218
Quit bugging 'em!

1126
01:00:47,302 --> 01:00:49,429
Leave 'em alone!
They like it!

1127
01:00:52,765 --> 01:00:56,518
I don't remember reading
any of this in your book.

1128
01:00:56,602 --> 01:01:01,106
Hello? It's called
reading between the lines!

1129
01:01:01,189 --> 01:01:02,399
Oh, my God.

1130
01:01:02,482 --> 01:01:03,984
What?

1131
01:01:04,067 --> 01:01:05,568
That's my mom.

1132
01:01:05,652 --> 01:01:07,570
Try listening
to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs,

1133
01:01:07,654 --> 01:01:09,197
The Vines, The Breeders.

1134
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,616
And if you're excited
about something,

1135
01:01:11,699 --> 01:01:14,201
why do you have to hold
it in all the time?

1136
01:01:14,285 --> 01:01:16,286
You know, just scream about it!

1137
01:01:16,328 --> 01:01:17,996
Okay, do this with me.

1138
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,499
Let's just say this
cute guy asks you out.

1139
01:01:20,582 --> 01:01:24,210
What are you gonna do?
Whoo!

1140
01:01:24,294 --> 01:01:25,295
Whoo!

1141
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:27,130
Whoo!

1142
01:01:27,213 --> 01:01:28,506
That was pathetic!

1143
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:31,634
You keep all that bottled up,
no wonder you're getting old!

1144
01:01:31,717 --> 01:01:33,260
I'm serious!
This guy's hot!

1145
01:01:33,344 --> 01:01:35,095
What are you gonna do?

1146
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:37,431
God, your mom's cool.

1147
01:01:37,473 --> 01:01:39,057
I can't hear you!

1148
01:01:39,141 --> 01:01:41,810
Whoo!

1149
01:01:41,893 --> 01:01:44,396
Oh, she is dead.
Worse than dead.

1150
01:01:44,479 --> 01:01:45,605
She will spend the next year

1151
01:01:45,688 --> 01:01:48,733
in a phoneless,
dateless, Amish existence.

1152
01:01:48,816 --> 01:01:50,026
I've gotta get home.

1153
01:01:50,109 --> 01:01:52,320
I've gotta get home.

1154
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:11,003
Listen, I need you
to give me a ride.

1155
01:02:11,087 --> 01:02:13,089
I thought your mom
didn't want you on a bike.

1156
01:02:13,172 --> 01:02:14,965
You're a little
too virtuous, kid.

1157
01:02:15,049 --> 01:02:17,801
You know what?
I'm late for my second job.

1158
01:02:17,843 --> 01:02:19,803
Just give me the ride.

1159
01:02:19,845 --> 01:02:22,222
I know my mother
will understand.

1160
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,015
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1161
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:27,936
You seem really different than
the person I thought you were.

1162
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:30,021
I saw what you
did to Stacey's test.

1163
01:02:30,104 --> 01:02:32,315
I think you're right.

1164
01:02:32,398 --> 01:02:33,774
You're too young for me.

1165
01:02:33,858 --> 01:02:35,818
But I don't know why I did that.

1166
01:02:35,901 --> 01:02:37,903
It's really not like me.
Honestly.

1167
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:39,446
Good luck, Anna.

1168
01:02:41,448 --> 01:02:43,867
Come on!
They'll let her retake the test!

1169
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,660
Ohh!

1170
01:02:45,702 --> 01:02:48,246
That's the first time Tessie's
work hasn't put me to sleep.

1171
01:02:48,329 --> 01:02:51,374
I might even read
one of those books.

1172
01:02:51,457 --> 01:02:54,335
Hey, is Dr. Coleman
coming out soon?

1173
01:02:54,418 --> 01:02:57,921
Dottie had her escorted from
the building 10 minutes ago.

1174
01:02:58,046 --> 01:02:59,965
But she rocks, doesn't she?

1175
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:03,510
Look, she signed my butt!

1176
01:03:03,593 --> 01:03:05,387
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1177
01:03:12,893 --> 01:03:15,437
Can I have
a quad-choc-caramel latte?

1178
01:03:18,524 --> 01:03:19,733
Mrs. Coleman?

1179
01:03:20,901 --> 01:03:23,695
Jake!
What are you doing here?

1180
01:03:23,737 --> 01:03:27,323
I work here.
Hey, I caught the show.

1181
01:03:27,407 --> 01:03:29,617
Man, you sure were great.

1182
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,369
Thanks.

1183
01:03:31,452 --> 01:03:32,703
How was Anna today?

1184
01:03:32,745 --> 01:03:35,206
I mean, was she nice to you?

1185
01:03:35,247 --> 01:03:37,249
She was stressing a little,

1186
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:39,668
but you know how it is
with school.

1187
01:03:39,751 --> 01:03:44,047
Okay, 'cause if she wasn't,
I'd have to punish her.

1188
01:03:44,923 --> 01:03:46,257
You punish her?

1189
01:03:46,341 --> 01:03:49,343
No mom who listens to The Vines
would punish anybody.

1190
01:03:49,427 --> 01:03:51,721
- You like The Vines?
- I got the bootlegs!

1191
01:03:51,804 --> 01:03:53,347
Shut up!

1192
01:03:53,431 --> 01:03:53,514
Whoo! Whoo!

1193
01:03:53,514 --> 01:03:56,100
Whoo! Whoo!

1194
01:03:56,183 --> 01:03:58,393
Oh, Anna Banana, it's you.

1195
01:03:58,477 --> 01:04:01,897
- Where's Mom?
- She ditched us at the studio.

1196
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,899
Harry, get down from
the table this instant!

1197
01:04:04,983 --> 01:04:07,569
I'm imitating Mom.
You should've seen her today!

1198
01:04:07,652 --> 01:04:09,153
She was so cool!

1199
01:04:09,237 --> 01:04:13,074
Whoo! Whoo!

1200
01:04:17,369 --> 01:04:19,371
Ramones?

1201
01:04:19,454 --> 01:04:20,997
Love.

1202
01:04:22,499 --> 01:04:24,501
White Stripes?

1203
01:04:24,584 --> 01:04:25,627
Can't stand 'em.

1204
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:28,254
I know! Me neither.
I mean, get a bass player.

1205
01:04:31,674 --> 01:04:32,717
I love this song.

1206
01:04:32,758 --> 01:04:35,427
Am I so lame that I would
love "Baby, One More Time"?

1207
01:04:35,469 --> 01:04:39,097
No, this cover's a classic.

1208
01:05:06,456 --> 01:05:08,291
I gotta go.

1209
01:05:08,374 --> 01:05:09,792
What?
Don't go.

1210
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:13,170
No, no.
I have a wedding rehearsal.

1211
01:05:13,254 --> 01:05:14,296
Okay, whose?

1212
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,798
Mine.

1213
01:05:17,257 --> 01:05:18,383
Are you serious?

1214
01:05:18,467 --> 01:05:20,427
I wish I wasn't.

1215
01:05:23,847 --> 01:05:26,432
You're not really
getting married, are you?

1216
01:05:26,516 --> 01:05:29,102
This was so fun, and I'm
gonna remember it forever.

1217
01:05:29,185 --> 01:05:31,479
- Okay, but you can't...
- Jake...

1218
01:05:31,562 --> 01:05:33,439
Look, I don't know
what's going on.

1219
01:05:33,481 --> 01:05:37,109
I don't know what
this whole thing is.

1220
01:05:37,192 --> 01:05:39,820
I feel like I know you.

1221
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:42,155
I have to go.
Really, I just...

1222
01:05:42,197 --> 01:05:45,200
Please.
Just please.

1223
01:05:46,284 --> 01:05:48,286
Let me at least
give you a ride.

1224
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:50,913
Okay.

1225
01:06:13,768 --> 01:06:16,812
Here you are,
you little monster.

1226
01:06:16,895 --> 01:06:18,355
Okay.

1227
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:38,207
Tess!

1228
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:40,167
Tess!

1229
01:06:42,919 --> 01:06:44,504
Tess!

1230
01:07:00,268 --> 01:07:01,603
Where have you been?

1231
01:07:01,686 --> 01:07:04,064
You needed to be dressed
a half hour ago!

1232
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:05,690
You tell me where you've
been, young lady!

1233
01:07:05,774 --> 01:07:07,233
Young lady?

1234
01:07:09,277 --> 01:07:11,487
Role-playing!
Her idea.

1235
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:15,115
New therapeutic technique.
Switching points of view.

1236
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:18,285
If I switch with Harry,
do I have to wear a thong?

1237
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,454
[Mockingly]
Earthquake! Save me!

1238
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,747
Get back here, you little.

1239
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:24,666
Where do I even begin?

1240
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,335
Could it be your
career-killing TV appearance,

1241
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:30,129
your nonstop partying
with my car and wallet,

1242
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,591
or, perhaps, my body's
makeover from hell?

1243
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,302
Are you listening
to a word I'm saying?

1244
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,386
Yes.

1245
01:07:37,469 --> 01:07:39,805
And get that cheap stud
out of my ear.

1246
01:07:39,888 --> 01:07:42,015
Mom, he is so awesome.

1247
01:07:42,098 --> 01:07:44,225
- Who?
- Jake.

1248
01:07:44,267 --> 01:07:46,936
Please, Mommy, can I
go out with him? Please?

1249
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,480
Not in Ryan's
fiancée's body, you can't.

1250
01:07:49,564 --> 01:07:52,483
What am I supposed to
do in Ryan's fiancée's body?

1251
01:07:52,566 --> 01:07:54,568
Go to this thing tonight?
Be you?

1252
01:07:54,652 --> 01:07:56,987
That's today.
What about tomorrow, Mom?

1253
01:07:57,071 --> 01:07:59,656
I really don't want
to get married.

1254
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,408
I don't think you're thrilled

1255
01:08:01,491 --> 01:08:03,785
about me getting married
either, Anna.

1256
01:08:05,453 --> 01:08:06,788
Why?

1257
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:09,290
Why can't we talk about this?

1258
01:08:09,332 --> 01:08:11,459
What is it about
Ryan you don't like?

1259
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:13,002
He's fine.

1260
01:08:13,919 --> 01:08:16,088
But he's not your father.

1261
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,757
Mom, look, I don't wanna talk
about this now.

1262
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:22,427
Time's running out to talk
about it. Please, tell me.

1263
01:08:22,511 --> 01:08:25,180
Mom, do what you want.

1264
01:08:25,263 --> 01:08:27,640
Marry the dude.
Just don't make me do it.

1265
01:08:27,724 --> 01:08:29,225
Tess?

1266
01:08:30,977 --> 01:08:33,062
[Mockingly]
Privacy's a privilege, Anna.

1267
01:08:33,145 --> 01:08:34,355
Tess?

1268
01:08:34,438 --> 01:08:35,981
Go.

1269
01:08:36,065 --> 01:08:37,357
Yo, sup?

1270
01:08:39,318 --> 01:08:42,195
I'm not really
a prying kind of guy,

1271
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:44,656
but I was wondering
what you were doing

1272
01:08:44,739 --> 01:08:46,199
on the eve of our wedding

1273
01:08:46,282 --> 01:08:49,660
straddling some guy on the
back of a big, black Harley.

1274
01:08:49,744 --> 01:08:51,996
Hello?
It was a Ducati.

1275
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:54,498
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

1276
01:08:54,582 --> 01:08:56,667
Some fantasy you're trying
to get out of your system?

1277
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:59,253
Because I'd like
to know about it now.

1278
01:09:00,545 --> 01:09:02,172
I just needed a ride.

1279
01:09:02,255 --> 01:09:04,799
I didn't really
even know the guy.

1280
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:07,176
I didn't know what...

1281
01:09:07,218 --> 01:09:10,054
He's a friend of mine, Ryan.

1282
01:09:10,138 --> 01:09:11,681
He likes me.

1283
01:09:11,764 --> 01:09:15,267
And my mom wouldn't
let me go out with him,

1284
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:20,814
so I just had to beg her
to check him out for me.

1285
01:09:20,897 --> 01:09:22,023
And she did.

1286
01:09:22,107 --> 01:09:24,651
And she actually came to find

1287
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,612
that he's a very
together young man.

1288
01:09:27,695 --> 01:09:31,032
And she approves.

1289
01:09:33,034 --> 01:09:34,118
Really?

1290
01:09:34,201 --> 01:09:35,160
Really.

1291
01:09:35,202 --> 01:09:37,538
Snap!

01:09:39,873 --> 01:09:40,874
Uh-huh.

1293
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:43,960
So, let's do this thingy!

1294
01:09:44,044 --> 01:09:47,380
- You mean our wedding rehearsal?
- Yeah, whatever.

1295
01:10:14,363 --> 01:10:16,073
Excuse me.

1296
01:10:24,205 --> 01:10:27,166
Ooh!

1297
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,127
What are you doing?

1298
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,461
Shotgun!

1299
01:10:30,545 --> 01:10:31,587
I want to talk to your mom.

1300
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:33,923
- Are you insane?
- I know I am.

1301
01:10:33,964 --> 01:10:35,090
What are you thinking?

1302
01:10:35,174 --> 01:10:38,510
How can you entertain ideas
about you and a woman her age?

1303
01:10:38,594 --> 01:10:41,054
What are you talking about?
She looks great.

1304
01:10:41,138 --> 01:10:43,431
Really? Wow.

1305
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:45,100
No!
You have to disappear!

1306
01:10:45,183 --> 01:10:47,018
I know
it's unconventional, okay?

1307
01:10:47,101 --> 01:10:50,021
And I know nothing can happen.
I'm not stupid.

1308
01:10:50,104 --> 01:10:51,856
I just want to know her.

1309
01:10:51,939 --> 01:10:53,399
I want to talk to her.

1310
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:55,693
Do not come near
my mother or her fiancé!

1311
01:10:55,776 --> 01:10:56,735
Do you understand?

1312
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:58,278
I don't understand anything.

1313
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,782
For God's sake, you really need
to find someone your own age.

1314
01:11:04,701 --> 01:11:08,913
Anna, you're beautiful, okay?
But you're not her.

1315
01:11:08,955 --> 01:11:11,290
Stop it! Promise you'll
leave my mother alone.

1316
01:11:11,374 --> 01:11:14,210
Anna Banana!

1317
01:11:19,172 --> 01:11:19,256
I'll give you one thing.

1318
01:11:19,256 --> 01:11:20,465
I'll give you one thing.

1319
01:11:20,549 --> 01:11:22,759
He definitely likes you
for your mind.

1320
01:11:38,815 --> 01:11:40,359
Come on!
Come on!

1321
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,661
All right, let's do this.

1322
01:11:55,331 --> 01:11:57,499
Oh, well, there we go.

1323
01:11:57,583 --> 01:11:58,709
Oh, I'll have one.

1324
01:11:58,792 --> 01:12:01,044
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Did you bring it?

1325
01:12:01,128 --> 01:12:02,504
Right here.
Can you get away?

1326
01:12:02,546 --> 01:12:03,588
Well, I'd love to.

1327
01:12:03,672 --> 01:12:05,090
It's just that
I'm meeting thousands

1328
01:12:05,173 --> 01:12:06,591
of 100-year-old people.

1329
01:12:06,674 --> 01:12:08,509
Those are Ryan's parents.
Hi.

1330
01:12:08,551 --> 01:12:11,345
- Doesn't make them any less old.
- Ryan.

1331
01:12:11,429 --> 01:12:15,182
Do you think I could borrow
my mother for just one minute?

1332
01:12:15,266 --> 01:12:16,684
Sure.

1333
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:18,894
Ow!

1334
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:25,066
Okay, there's gotta be
some clue here.

1335
01:12:27,402 --> 01:12:28,986
"A journey soon begins,

1336
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:31,822
its prize reflected
in another's eyes."

1337
01:12:31,864 --> 01:12:33,449
Okay, that was the switch.

1338
01:12:33,532 --> 01:12:34,575
Oh, let me see.

1339
01:12:34,658 --> 01:12:36,660
Okay, blah, blah.

1340
01:12:36,702 --> 01:12:39,997
"Lack, then selfless love
will change you back."

1341
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,706
So that means
we're stuck like this forever.

1342
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,750
Now is not a moment
for your negativity.

1343
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:45,502
Let's try to be selfless.

1344
01:12:45,543 --> 01:12:47,378
Give me your hands.

1345
01:12:52,133 --> 01:12:54,635
I'm being selfless.
Are you being selfless?

1346
01:12:54,718 --> 01:12:56,053
Yeah, I'm being selfless.

1347
01:12:56,095 --> 01:12:58,472
You're not doing a good job.
We're still here.

1348
01:12:58,555 --> 01:13:00,390
Oh, right.
So now it's my fault.

1349
01:13:00,474 --> 01:13:04,561
Why is everything always...
It's Jake!

1350
01:13:04,644 --> 01:13:09,148
He must've followed us.
Mom, what're we gonna do?

1351
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:10,149
Mom?

1352
01:13:10,942 --> 01:13:12,276
Mom!

1353
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,237
Shh! Shh!
Don't scream.

1354
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:16,488
Just listen to us.

1355
01:13:16,572 --> 01:13:18,282
We are half a block
from the House of Blues.

1356
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:20,867
Tell 'em you're going to
the bathroom, do the song,

1357
01:13:20,951 --> 01:13:23,578
you'll be back before
they know you've gone.

1358
01:13:23,662 --> 01:13:25,580
I tried to learn your solo,
and I suck.

1359
01:13:25,622 --> 01:13:27,915
Two bands have gone,
and they both blew.

1360
01:13:27,999 --> 01:13:29,876
We might have a chance
if you come.

1361
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:33,254
When I say I can't,
you don't know the half of it.

1362
01:13:33,337 --> 01:13:35,297
Don't make me do this.

1363
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:47,016
What are you doing?

1364
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:50,102
If Ryan sees you here,
it will blow everything.

1365
01:13:50,186 --> 01:13:51,103
I know.
I'm sorry.

1366
01:13:51,187 --> 01:13:53,981
It's just,
when I look into your eyes...

1367
01:13:54,064 --> 01:13:55,065
Stop it!

1368
01:13:55,149 --> 01:13:58,694
Jake, believe me, it is not
me you like, it's Anna.

1369
01:13:58,777 --> 01:14:02,113
No, you're the exciting one.
The musical one.

1370
01:14:02,197 --> 01:14:04,115
Actually, I learned it from her.

1371
01:14:04,157 --> 01:14:05,492
I'm tone-deaf.

1372
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:07,619
- Tess?
- Shh. Don't move.

1373
01:14:07,702 --> 01:14:08,369
Tess?

1374
01:14:08,453 --> 01:14:10,496
Oh, found it!

1375
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:12,373
- Found what?
- My earring.

1376
01:14:12,456 --> 01:14:14,625
I thought I lost it.

1377
01:14:16,668 --> 01:14:19,379
Anna's friends decided to crash.

1378
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:20,839
You guys!

1379
01:14:20,922 --> 01:14:22,674
You know anything about this?

1380
01:14:22,757 --> 01:14:28,096
Well, I think they're trying
to get Anna to go to an audition

1381
01:14:28,137 --> 01:14:30,806
which had to be tonight,
but I said no.

1382
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:32,141
She had to stay here.

1383
01:14:32,183 --> 01:14:34,685
- You're kidding.
- No, that's how it went down.

1384
01:14:34,768 --> 01:14:35,853
I know it's not important to you

1385
01:14:35,936 --> 01:14:37,980
and that she's just a girl
in a stupid band.

1386
01:14:38,063 --> 01:14:41,983
Look, Dr. Coleman, dude,
I'm really sorry,

1387
01:14:42,025 --> 01:14:44,486
but couldn't we borrow
Anna for 20 minutes?

1388
01:14:44,527 --> 01:14:47,989
We'd never ask you, or
anybody for anything ever again.

1389
01:14:48,031 --> 01:14:50,825
I am appalled at you two.
I clearly said...

1390
01:14:50,867 --> 01:14:51,951
Go.

1391
01:14:52,827 --> 01:14:53,661
What?

1392
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:54,912
Go.

1393
01:14:55,496 --> 01:14:56,330
Ryan.

1394
01:14:56,413 --> 01:14:59,207
What are you still doing here?
Go! Right now!

1395
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:00,709
Thank you so much!

1396
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:03,753
I told you he wouldn't
totally ruin your life!

1397
01:15:03,837 --> 01:15:07,632
Mister Dude, you rock!

1398
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:09,008
Thanks, Mitch.

1399
01:15:13,888 --> 01:15:16,181
Are you mad?

1400
01:15:16,265 --> 01:15:17,516
No.

1401
01:15:19,434 --> 01:15:21,895
Do you, like, not want
to get married now?

1402
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:25,315
No.

1403
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:30,236
No, I don't, not if you're
gonna put me in this role.

1404
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:31,028
What role?

1405
01:15:31,112 --> 01:15:33,114
The role of
insensitive stepfather

1406
01:15:33,197 --> 01:15:35,908
who couldn't care less or
thinks it's a stupid band,

1407
01:15:35,991 --> 01:15:39,369
or any of the preposterous
things you just said.

1408
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:42,205
How can you say I don't care?
I'm not that guy.

1409
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:45,542
If that's who you think I am,
this is never gonna work.

1410
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:48,461
When I fell in love with you,
I knew you came with a family,

1411
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,463
and I respect
the hell out of that.

1412
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,839
You've always
put the kids first.

1413
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:55,217
That's exactly how it should be.
That's how I want it.

1414
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,679
I never pushed Anna
because I want her to like me

1415
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,848
on her own terms,
in her own way.

1416
01:16:02,974 --> 01:16:04,392
Wow.

1417
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:06,811
That's very cool.

1418
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,271
Yeah.

1419
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:12,066
Now, what are you
still doing here?

1420
01:16:12,108 --> 01:16:13,067
What do you mean?

1421
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:15,361
You should be over there.

1422
01:16:15,402 --> 01:16:17,654
That's where you ought to be.
Cheering her on.

1423
01:16:17,738 --> 01:16:19,489
That's where I want you to be.

1424
01:16:19,573 --> 01:16:21,241
Go on. Go.

1425
01:16:21,324 --> 01:16:25,370
I can hold down the fort here
for 20 minutes.

1426
01:16:25,412 --> 01:16:27,205
Wish her luck for me.

1427
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:30,208
Okay.

1428
01:16:44,012 --> 01:16:45,263
Whoa, hold it.

1429
01:16:45,346 --> 01:16:47,432
Oh, you're not serious.
No!

1430
01:16:47,515 --> 01:16:51,060
Okay, great.
I've got I.D. For once.

1431
01:16:51,102 --> 01:16:51,811
Thanks.

1432
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,779
So, it's a good crowd out there.

1433
01:17:04,155 --> 01:17:06,324
Anna, what are you doing?
What's wrong?

1434
01:17:06,407 --> 01:17:07,533
I can't do this.

1435
01:17:07,617 --> 01:17:09,285
Since when do you get nervous?

1436
01:17:09,368 --> 01:17:10,536
No, I really can't.

1437
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:13,122
Come on, you rock
harder than anyone I know.

1438
01:17:13,205 --> 01:17:16,542
Well, the rocking may be
in short supply tonight, girls.

1439
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:19,878
- What do you mean?
- I'm just not myself.

1440
01:17:19,962 --> 01:17:21,922
Anna, I know you're stressing.

1441
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:25,467
We all are, and I know that
maybe it won't be brilliant,

1442
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:27,093
but we'll forgive each other.

1443
01:17:27,135 --> 01:17:29,053
We'll find some way
to laugh about it.

1444
01:17:29,137 --> 01:17:32,431
Right now, I just really want us
to take this shot, okay?

1445
01:17:32,473 --> 01:17:34,767
We'll still love you,
even if it blows.

1446
01:17:34,808 --> 01:17:36,143
Yeah.

1447
01:17:36,226 --> 01:17:38,187
Okay, okay, okay, I'll try.

1448
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:39,771
I mean, how hard can it be?

1449
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:40,939
So don't forget

1450
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:43,149
we changed the chord
progression in the first verse

1451
01:17:43,233 --> 01:17:45,944
from C-C-D to C-D-C.

1452
01:17:45,985 --> 01:17:48,029
You play notes?

1453
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:53,075
I mean, I just thought we
could play in the key of "rock"!

1454
01:17:53,993 --> 01:17:55,995
Yeah, okay.
Let's fix your hair.

1455
01:17:56,036 --> 01:17:58,330
Yeah, what's with the bun?

1456
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:02,834
Mrs. Coleman!

1457
01:18:02,918 --> 01:18:04,461
Jake, stop!

1458
01:18:04,544 --> 01:18:06,212
You're running away from him.

1459
01:18:06,296 --> 01:18:10,007
Jake, if you like me at all,
you will just leave me alone.

1460
01:18:10,091 --> 01:18:10,883
Yeah, but...

1461
01:18:10,967 --> 01:18:12,968
Please, no!

1462
01:18:14,053 --> 01:18:17,431
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage

1463
01:18:17,514 --> 01:18:20,851
the next act in the KllSFM
Wango Tango auditions,

1464
01:18:20,934 --> 01:18:25,980
from right here in Los Angeles,
let's give it up for Pink Slip!

1465
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:48,376
Do something!

1466
01:19:39,589 --> 01:19:42,008
- What are you doing?
- I can't do this!

1467
01:19:42,092 --> 01:19:43,635
No, it's okay.
I unplugged you.

1468
01:19:43,718 --> 01:19:44,761
Just fake it.

1469
01:19:44,844 --> 01:19:47,055
I don't even know
how to do that.

1470
01:19:47,096 --> 01:19:49,974
You can't tell me you never
went to a rock concert.

1471
01:19:50,057 --> 01:19:51,767
- I saw the Stones once.
- Great!

1472
01:19:51,809 --> 01:19:53,811
Just go out and act like Keith!

1473
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:55,396
Keith, right, yeah.

1474
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:56,438
Richards, Mom!

1475
01:19:56,522 --> 01:19:57,564
I knew that.

1476
01:19:57,648 --> 01:19:59,274
Just go act like Keith.

1477
01:19:59,358 --> 01:20:01,693
Act like Keith.
Not the behavior?

1478
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:03,194
No, just the playing!

1479
01:20:03,278 --> 01:20:06,447
Now get out there!
Your solo's coming!

1480
01:21:04,959 --> 01:21:05,585
Whoo!

1481
01:21:05,668 --> 01:21:07,795
Anna, you rock!

1482
01:21:41,827 --> 01:21:44,621
It's early, but I think
you are definitely in.

1483
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,456
All right!

1484
01:21:46,539 --> 01:21:48,624
- Are we in?
- Yes!

1485
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:52,211
Oh, it was terrifying.
I had no idea what it takes.

1486
01:21:52,294 --> 01:21:53,796
- The guts.
- Thanks.

1487
01:21:53,879 --> 01:21:55,714
It's exciting.
Your music.

1488
01:21:55,756 --> 01:21:58,759
- It's not noise?
- Most definitely not noise.

1489
01:22:00,844 --> 01:22:02,804
Oh, my God!
Ryan!

1490
01:22:07,517 --> 01:22:08,726
Anna?

1491
01:22:16,442 --> 01:22:16,525
My first wedding
went like this, you know.

1492
01:22:16,525 --> 01:22:18,777
My first wedding
went like this, you know.

1493
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,738
- Like what?
- She ran away with the florist.

1494
01:22:21,822 --> 01:22:24,407
Whole thing
went right down the tubes.

1495
01:22:25,075 --> 01:22:26,868
Don't make me hurt you.

1496
01:22:30,371 --> 01:22:32,248
There she is.

1497
01:22:32,289 --> 01:22:34,208
Look, look, look.

1498
01:22:46,844 --> 01:22:48,262
Mom, what's wrong?

1499
01:22:48,346 --> 01:22:50,765
I have to ask you
to do something for me.

1500
01:22:50,806 --> 01:22:53,934
Sure, whatever. After what you
just did for me, anything.

1501
01:22:54,018 --> 01:22:56,520
It needs to happen before
the toasts and speeches.

1502
01:22:56,603 --> 01:22:57,479
Okay.

1503
01:22:57,563 --> 01:23:00,857
Clearly, we're not
switching back tonight.

1504
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:03,818
I need you to tell Ryan you
need to postpone the wedding.

1505
01:23:03,902 --> 01:23:04,778
What?

1506
01:23:04,861 --> 01:23:08,114
No, listen, I can see
you're not ready for this.

1507
01:23:08,156 --> 01:23:09,907
And I can wait.

1508
01:23:09,949 --> 01:23:11,409
I guess I was so happy,

1509
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:14,745
I wasn't thinking about
what's best for you and Harry.

1510
01:23:14,787 --> 01:23:16,580
But, Mom.

1511
01:23:16,622 --> 01:23:20,584
If he loves me like I think
he does, he'll wait, too.

1512
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:22,919
He'll understand.

1513
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:26,422
He'll be very sweet
and gracious about it.

1514
01:23:26,506 --> 01:23:28,800
But please.

1515
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:31,594
Just please let him know
that I love him.

1516
01:23:31,636 --> 01:23:35,681
And be as kind as you
possibly can for me.

1517
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:38,392
Okay, Mom.

1518
01:23:39,309 --> 01:23:41,144
I know exactly what to say.

1519
01:23:41,186 --> 01:23:43,146
I'll be along in a minute.

1520
01:23:56,742 --> 01:23:58,285
You should sit down.

1521
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:05,583
[Glass dings]

1522
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:13,340
Hi.

1523
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:19,680
I guess
I'm gonna start the toasts.

1524
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,390
So, three years ago,

1525
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:25,810
we had a really bad thing
happen in our family.

1526
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:29,897
We lost a father and a husband,

1527
01:24:29,981 --> 01:24:33,859
and I didn't think we'd ever
be able to get over it.

1528
01:24:33,901 --> 01:24:35,444
But then...

1529
01:24:36,862 --> 01:24:41,825
This guy next to me
came into the picture.

1530
01:24:42,993 --> 01:24:45,995
And everybody could see
I was happy again.

1531
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:49,582
I was singing
in the shower again.

1532
01:24:49,665 --> 01:24:51,792
Not well, I might add.

1533
01:24:54,879 --> 01:24:59,424
But I was still really worried
about my kids, Anna and Harry.

1534
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:06,472
Whether they'd be able to accept
a new man in their life.

1535
01:25:07,974 --> 01:25:11,102
And now I know how Anna feels.

1536
01:25:13,771 --> 01:25:16,565
And what she feels is that...

1537
01:25:18,984 --> 01:25:22,654
No one could ever
take the place of her dad...

1538
01:25:25,573 --> 01:25:28,701
Because he was
a really great dad.

1539
01:25:29,911 --> 01:25:36,250
But somebody could be
part of a new family.

1540
01:25:36,291 --> 01:25:41,880
Its own kind of cool,
new, little unit.

1541
01:25:43,256 --> 01:25:46,092
And that for someone
as special as Ryan,

1542
01:25:46,134 --> 01:25:49,595
that we would all
just make a little room.

1543
01:25:51,847 --> 01:25:54,975
Anna really wanted her mom
to know that.

1544
01:26:04,943 --> 01:26:06,861
Earthquake!

1545
01:26:28,256 --> 01:26:29,423
Yeah!

1546
01:26:32,134 --> 01:26:35,596
And I am so psyched to be here!

1547
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:41,726
I guess all I'm trying to say
is, Ryan, welcome to our family.

1548
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:43,853
To the bride and groom.

1549
01:26:45,396 --> 01:26:47,065
What the hell just happened?

1550
01:26:47,148 --> 01:26:49,817
Trust me,
you don't want to know.

1551
01:27:20,971 --> 01:27:23,974
Thank you for everything.

1552
01:27:24,057 --> 01:27:25,016
I love you.

1553
01:27:25,058 --> 01:27:27,268
I love you, too.

1554
01:27:30,563 --> 01:27:31,856
What?

1555
01:27:34,984 --> 01:27:36,652
Go.

1556
01:27:36,693 --> 01:27:38,195
Go.

1557
01:27:42,699 --> 01:27:43,700
Hi.

1558
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:50,831
Listen, I feel really stupid.

1559
01:27:51,874 --> 01:27:55,878
You know, it's just
yesterday was freaky,

1560
01:27:55,961 --> 01:28:00,298
and, I mean, I see your mom,
and I like her.

1561
01:28:00,382 --> 01:28:02,384
I mean, not "like her" like her,

1562
01:28:02,467 --> 01:28:05,345
but, you know, I mean,
like her as your mom.

1563
01:28:06,221 --> 01:28:10,057
Listen, do you think we could
just rewind this whole thing

1564
01:28:10,099 --> 01:28:11,934
and start again?

1565
01:28:12,018 --> 01:28:13,561
I'd like that.

1566
01:28:24,404 --> 01:28:27,782
You know, I've been thinking
about that kiss.

1567
01:28:27,865 --> 01:28:29,367
Kiss?

1568
01:28:32,244 --> 01:28:34,705
Remind me again how I did it.

1569
01:28:35,748 --> 01:28:37,207
In front of your mom?

1570
01:28:37,249 --> 01:28:39,668
It's okay.
She owes me.

1571
01:29:15,993 --> 01:29:18,787
Hey, why don't you ask
that girl to dance?

1572
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:19,705
No way!

1573
01:29:19,788 --> 01:29:22,749
- Come on, go on over there.
- Stop bugging me.

1574
01:29:22,832 --> 01:29:26,544
Boy, it's true.
Youth is wasted on the young.

1575
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:28,337
You go ask her, you old fart.

1576
01:29:28,421 --> 01:29:29,714
Now, wait a minute!

1577
01:29:29,797 --> 01:29:31,507
Why, if I was your age, oh!

1578
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:32,383
Cookie?

1579
01:29:32,466 --> 01:29:36,637
Well, why, yes,
I don't mind if I do.

1580
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:40,515
Mama! What are you doing?

1581
01:29:40,599 --> 01:29:41,975
Mama!

1582
01:29:42,017 --> 01:29:44,811
Grandpa! Harry!
No!

1583
01:29:48,731 --> 01:29:50,608
Okay!
