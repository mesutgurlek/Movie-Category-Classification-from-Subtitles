00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,664
Mr. Crockett,
American Insurance Federation.

159
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,208
DOCTOR: Jay. Jay.

160
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,254
Are you telling me you haven´t
eaten or slept in three days?

161
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,422
That´s not good.

162
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,924
Maybe you should talk
to someone.

163
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,051
l´II give you a name.
Milton Alexander.

164
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,220
He´s head of Psychiatry
at Georgetown.

165
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,555
Uh, I got a meeting here.

166
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,348
This bill will devastate us.

167
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,975
- It will be...
- Crockett.

168
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,310
CROCKETT: Can I call you back?

169
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,312
DAVERS: Doc, how´s he doing?

170
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,189
Fine. Fine.

171
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,232
- How are you doing?
- Fine, fine. You?

172
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,902
- Fine.
- Fine.

173
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,531
Can you believe
this goddamn regulation bill?

174
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,783
Is the whole world going insane?

175
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,328
When you consider
the dislocation...

176
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,039
in the relationships
with the state commissioners...

177
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,207
or the effect
on the rate structure...

178
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,542
This bill´s
gonna cost us billions.

179
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,961
And it´s the usual people
making trouble.

180
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,796
You think l´m gonna say
it´s the African Americans.

181
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,090
It´s not the African Americans.

182
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,593
I have no problem
with African Americans.

183
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:30,928
l´m not other people.

184
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:34,348
Dr. Martin Luther King,
Colin Powell, Michael Jordan...

185
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,726
I have no problem with them.
They have good jobs.

186
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,646
But you throw down
some lazy, welfare-taking...

187
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,689
drug-dealing,
rap-singing punk...

188
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:46,568
and tell me my people
have to give him a policy. Why?

189
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,531
So he can burn down his house?
Or smoke crack and get AIDS?

190
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,575
JAY: You can´t get AIDS
by burning your house down.

191
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,577
DOBISH: We got
the broadcasters, insurance...

192
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,204
A.M. A... Buddhists?

193
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,580
What about the Buddhists?

194
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,917
Vinnie! Ha ha ha ha!

195
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:05,295
Vinnie, you son of a bitch,
how are you?

196
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:07,589
How you been?

197
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:10,217
Other than the prostate
like a coffee cake...

198
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,511
a little ticker trouble...
terrific.

199
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,222
To use an overworked phrase,
this bill is...

200
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:17,099
The bill is un-American.

201
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,184
And I have
total confidence in you...

202
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,646
that you can bottle up this bill
in committee.

203
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:23,939
What have we got there?

204
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,774
Oh, I got
your homeowner´s insurance...

205
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:29,027
disability insurance,
umbrella, liability...

206
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,863
and I see no reason
why you shouldn´t have...

207
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,698
a couple million dollars
in life insurance.

208
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,783
I thought we said ten.

209
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,244
- What?
- Ten. Ten million.

210
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,745
Pesos?

211
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,622
Senator... Ha ha ha.

212
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:44,585
I feel constrained to remind you
that what we said was...

213
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,461
a couple of million
paid to your daughter...

214
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,046
Four payments,
2.5 million each...

215
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,048
ten million dollars
to my daughter.

216
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,428
Would five do it?

217
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,598
Why don´t we just say seven?

218
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:03,812
Ten million.
That´s a lot of life insurance.

219
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:10,485
If Jay Bulworth plays ball,
we´II play ball.

220
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,572
DAVERS: Oh, Senator,
I want you to meet Vinnie.

221
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,908
JAY: Vinnie, how are you?

222
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,994
Ready for the weekend
research project?

223
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,662
Davers, could you excuse us?
Thanks.

224
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,916
DAVERS: Uh, all right, Senator,
l´II be right outside.

225
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,419
HELEN: Tell her we need
U.S. American dollars.

226
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,338
JAY: Small bills.

227
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,840
I wish I didn´t have to go
through Davers to talk to you.

228
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,885
Davers can always reach me.
Davers is a sweetheart.

229
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,929
JAY: Did Davers ask you...

230
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,931
what the weekend
research project was?

231
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,557
VINNIE: [Clicks tongue]
Uh-uh.

232
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,018
JAY: Good.
Nobody knows but you and me.

233
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,353
VINNIE: You and me, Senator.

234
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,521
JAY: That´s good.

235
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,772
Here´s a couple of pictures
of the person.

236
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:50,526
Give them to whomever
is gonna do the, uh...

237
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,278
- Research.
- Research.

238
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,113
This is the first time...

239
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,407
l´ve ever arranged
to get a guy to off a guy...

240
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,910
who I don´t know who the guy is
who he´s gonna off.

241
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,078
You mean, research.

242
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,497
Yeah, research a guy
who I don´t know who it is.

243
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,998
You said
you didn´t have to know.

244
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,502
l´m just the liaison. I don´t
want to know who this is...

245
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,754
and I don´t want nobody knowin´
nothin´ about me.

246
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,297
I need to talk to you,
I call Eddie Davers.

247
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,882
You need to talk to me,
you call Eddie Davers.

248
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,717
That way nobody knows nothin´.

249
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,135
- Fine.
- Except for one thing.

250
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,971
- What´s that?
- I gotta know who this guy is.

251
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,975
- You just said...
- But that was in the abstract.

252
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,393
Now that we´re really
doin´ it...

253
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,896
and you don´t tell me
who this is, and then, uh...

254
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,398
Simple math.

255
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,526
Take a look.

256
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,084
Excuse me.

257
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,628
What´s the gag?

258
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,714
He will be arriving at LAX...

259
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,676
tomorrow night at 8:40
on American Airlines.

260
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,305
A check for the second half
of the money.

261
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,808
If l´m not dead by Monday,
I stop payment on that check.

262
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:19,448
P. A:
Thank you for flying with us.

263
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,992
Have a pleasant stay
in Los Angeles.

264
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:25,078
As you exit the aircraft,
our flight agents...

265
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,706
will help direct you
to any connecting flights.

266
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,125
Oh, and have a nice day.

267
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,544
MURPHY: Welcome back.
Did you sleep on the plane?

268
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,172
We´re running late, so let me
run through some changes.

269
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:37,174
By the way,
excellent work with Crockett.

270
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,092
The final haul
from the Sunday brunch is 1.1.

271
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,511
Insurance came up with 250.

272
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,180
We got two from oil, banks
are in for one and a half...

273
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,224
A.M.A. and the lawyers
came in just south of 100.

274
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:49,811
Gloria Allred got very excited
over your O.J. statement.

275
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,814
Even the women have coughed up.
Came in with about 65.

276
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,608
We do have a new schedule.

277
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,653
We have a black church,
and then we have Beverly Hills.

278
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,530
VINNIE: He´s here.

279
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,282
MURPHY: It´d be nice later
to have a drink with the sultan.

280
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,450
VINNIE: The guy is nuts.

281
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,660
FRED: Welcome home, Senator.

282
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,703
- What´s this?
- I told you.

283
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,205
MURPHY: Twenty-four hours
on the campaign trail.

284
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:11,667
This is Gary Plunkett of C-SPAN.

285
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,669
And Fred Tinsdale
and Mimi Binder.

286
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,755
FRED: How you doing?
Mimi and I are gonna be...

287
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,674
right behind you
in the truck, Senator.

288
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,925
MIMl: Fred, get in the truck.

289
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,678
So, C-SPAN
is gonna be with us all night?

290
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,596
MURPHY: All weekend.
Tonight´s installment...

291
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:26,348
airs tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.

292
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,558
JAY: Where are we going?

293
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,854
MURPHY: First stop, we are going
down to South Central.

294
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,690
Did you get a copy
of the schedule?

295
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,358
We´re gonna be on the go.

296
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,069
First stop is South Central and
the African-American community.

297
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,113
Gee, your African-American
constituents...

298
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,739
down in South Central...

299
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,575
don´t forget what you´ve done
for them, do they?

300
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,742
Where we going?

301
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,828
MURPHY: Down to Grace Church.

302
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,496
- Fred.
- What?

303
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,206
Did you say
you´d covered Bulworth before?

304
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,458
FRED: Yeah.
These things go by the book.

305
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,169
MURPHY:
Then over to Beverly Hills...

306
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,172
to meet some big names
in the entertainment business.

307
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,090
[Singing gospel hymn]

308
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,230
MURPHY: Scotty, how are you?

309
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:19,067
Vivian, Rwanda,
I didn´t expect you to be here.

310
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,486
Those key chains look fantastic.

311
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,822
How you feeling, Senator?

312
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,491
Get any sleep on the plane?

Huey.

Why do you think
there are no more black leaders?

NINA: Some think it´s because
they all got killed...

1047
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:13,078
but I think
it´s from the decimation...

1048
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,038
of urban manufacturing bases.

1049
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,917
Senator, an optimistic,

throws up optimistic,
energized leaders.

1051
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:23,213
When you shift manufacturing
to the Third World...

1052
00:49:23,255 --> 00:49:25,507
you destroy
the blue-collar core...

1053
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,885
of the black activist
population.

1054
00:49:27,926 --> 00:49:31,013
Some people would say
the problem is cultural.

1055
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:34,016
But the media is controlled
by fewer and fewer people.

1056
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:38,395
Add to that a consumer culture
based on self-gratification...

1057
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:40,647
and it means nobody
wants leaders...

calling for self-sacrifice.

1059
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:45,068
Fact is, l´m a materialist.

1060
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,570
If I look at the economy...

1061
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:49,573
high employment means
jobs for African-Americans.

1062
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:51,867
World War II meant
lots of jobs for black folks.

1063
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:56,580
That´s what energized people
for the civil rights movement.

An energized,
hopeful community...

00:51:09,236 --> 00:51:11,405
You didn´t
have to push him off.

1093
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:14,074
You just had
to get him upstairs.

1094
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:15,367
l´ve had it with you!

1095
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:16,869
Vinnie, wait.

1096
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,746
You move on to plan B.

1097
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:22,165
What the fuck is plan B?

1098
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:25,711
You know plan B.
And you better get it done.

1099
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:30,591
You said if I got him up
to the room, l´d get 10 Gs.

1100
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:32,092
[Telephone rings]

1101
00:51:32,134 --> 00:51:34,636
- Fucking bimbo!
- Vinnie.

1102
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:36,805
[Dial tone]

1103
00:51:36,847 --> 00:51:38,640
[Telephone rings]

1104
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:41,059
DAVERS: Vinnie! Davers.

1105
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:43,645
The Senator
wants to speak with you.

1106
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:47,191
Hey, Vinnie. Vinnie, my friend,
how are you?

1107
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:50,777
Vinnie, l´m very relieved
to get in touch with you...

1108
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:53,864
because we´re gonna have
to call off...

1109
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:55,240
the weekend research project.

1110
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:56,450
Call it off?

1111
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:58,827
- That´s not a problem, is it?
- Not a problem?

1112
00:51:58,827 --> 00:52:02,164
My plans have changed.

1113
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:04,583
But you keep the fee.
That´s not a problem, is it?

1114
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,084
No.

1115
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:08,295
Oh, good!

1116
00:52:08,337 --> 00:52:10,339
Good, good, Vinnie.

1117
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,257
[Laughs]

1118
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:14,718
Let me ask you a favor.

1119
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,180
Can we keep this
just between the two of us?

1120
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:22,309
You and me
and whoever´s doing the thing?

1121
00:52:22,351 --> 00:52:25,270
We´re gonna need a surcharge.

1122
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:27,481
- Fine.
- Cancellation fee.

1123
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:30,025
OK. Just keep the check.

1124
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:32,277
No. An additional 50,000.

1125
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,738
That´s good.

1126
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,825
l´II send Davers over right away
with another check.

1127
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:40,202
Shall we consider it done?

1128
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:41,745
Yeah.

1129
00:52:41,787 --> 00:52:45,374
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1130
00:52:45,415 --> 00:52:48,460
Good. Thanks, Vinnie, thanks.

1131
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:50,838
You´re welcome.

1132
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:52,714
Fuckin´ crazy motherfucker.

1133
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:58,220
Senator, what is
a weekend research project?

1134
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,974
No, it´s a... It´s nothing.

1135
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:04,017
It´s all off.

1136
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:07,062
That guy´s nuts.

1137
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:14,570
I don´t feel too good.

1138
00:53:14,611 --> 00:53:16,113
Want something?

1139
00:53:24,788 --> 00:53:26,123
Vinnie.

1140
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:27,708
You want something?

1141
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:31,795
Vinnie!

1142
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:34,173
I gotta go. L´m out.

1143
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:35,340
JAY: All right!

1144
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:37,134
All right!

1145
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:39,261
[Rapping] We´re late,
we´re late, we´re late!

1146
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:41,096
For a very important debate!

1147
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:44,224
And l´m feeling so great
while l´m feeling my fate

1148
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:45,559
when I get to the gate...

1149
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:46,894
DAVERS: Senator!

1150
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:49,396
JAY: ´Cause I got a new slate
on my plate and it´s great

1151
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:57,654
If you want to hide,
I know a place.

1152
00:53:57,696 --> 00:53:59,948
You think after all this crap
is over Tuesday...

1153
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,993
that maybe you could
actually, like, hang?

1154
00:54:03,035 --> 00:54:06,163
- Hang?
- Hang out with me?

1155
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:07,623
Oh, hang out with you.

1156
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:09,166
What do you think?

1157
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,292
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1158
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:12,711
I got the plan.
Want to meet my family tonight?

1159
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:16,632
Oh, that would... That´s great.

1160
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:18,467
[Rapping]
That´s great, that´s great

1161
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:19,968
I got a whole new slate

1162
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,596
I get to meet the family,
I can hardly wait

1163
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:26,141
MURPHY: I think he´s finally
recognizing the situation...

1164
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:27,643
and getting some sleep.

1165
00:54:27,643 --> 00:54:28,852
FELDMAN: There´s...

1166
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:32,272
MURPHY: OK, listen to me.

1167
00:54:32,314 --> 00:54:34,816
l´m not letting him
on television...

1168
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:37,402
until he explains himself.

1169
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:40,322
Say he got a disease
or stuck in traffic.

1170
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:42,407
We´II stand here
and block him...

1171
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:44,618
arms akimbo if necessary.

1172
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:48,372
Prevent him from doing further
damage to his and our careers.

1173
00:54:48,413 --> 00:54:51,959
l´m explicitly authorizing
the use of force at this point.

1174
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,169
JAY: Murphy, Feldman, Macavoy.

1175
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,046
FELDMAN: Hey, boss.

1176
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:57,506
MURPHY: Didn´t work.

1177
00:54:57,506 --> 00:54:59,925
I think he´s OK now.
Got the electric razor?

1178
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,052
- I got the razor.
- Get him to shave.

1179
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:04,513
FELDMAN: They´re ready.
How about a quick shave?

1180
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:08,684
The format agreed to
is as follows...

1181
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:10,394
there will be
no opening statements.

1182
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:12,563
Questions will be addressed
to each of the candidates...

1183
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:14,022
in alternating order.

1184
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:15,357
The candidate to whom
the question is addressed...

1185
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:17,860
will have two and a half minutes
to answer.

1186
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:20,362
The other candidate will then
have one minute to reply.

1187
00:55:20,362 --> 00:55:22,948
And the first candidate will
then have another 30 seconds...

1188
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:25,033
for a final comment
on that question.

1189
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:26,326
After the allotted time
for questions...

1190
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:27,953
each candidate
will make a final statement...

1191
00:55:27,995 --> 00:55:29,496
of three minutes.

1192
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:31,248
Mr. Weldie
won the drawing of lots.

1193
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:32,708
He´s elected to make
his closing statement.

1194
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:35,878
NINA: I was supposed
to set him up, not do the shit.

1195
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:38,505
Now I can´t even get Vinnie
on the damn phone.

1196
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:41,466
HILL: The first question
will be from Jann Carl...

1197
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:42,759
and is for Senator Bulworth.

1198
00:55:42,801 --> 00:55:45,012
CARL: Senator, the news today
requires us to ask you...

1199
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,556
about this sudden change
in your campaign style.

1200
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:48,807
Could you explain it?

1201
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:49,975
JAY: Why are you here?

1202
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:52,519
Admit it.
It´s ´cause you make a bundle.

1203
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:55,689
CARL: I beg your pardon?

1204
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:58,358
You´re not here ´cause you´re
getting paid a bundle of money.

1205
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,902
Come on, come on.

1206
00:55:59,943 --> 00:56:01,486
We got three
pretty rich guys here...

1207
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:05,407
getting paid
by some really rich guys...

1208
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:08,160
to ask a couple
of other rich guys...

1209
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:10,704
questions about their campaign.

1210
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:14,041
But our campaigns are financed
by the same guys...

1211
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:15,751
that pay you guys your money...

1212
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:17,794
so what are we talking about?

1213
00:56:17,836 --> 00:56:19,379
NINA: l´m bringing the man
down there.

1214
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:21,423
If they don´t like it,
they can kiss my ass.

1215
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:22,633
I could tell you stories...

1216
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:25,177
about getting money from them
that would pin your ears back.

1217
00:56:25,219 --> 00:56:27,304
Stories about me.

1218
00:56:27,346 --> 00:56:29,431
I don´t know about Hugh.

1219
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:31,517
Do you have that, uh...

1220
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:33,143
Well...

1221
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:35,437
But, uh, I tell you...

1222
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:37,189
WOMAN:
He´s got something hot here.

1223
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:38,649
JAY: Republicans, Democrats,
what´s the difference?

1224
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,486
Your guys, my guys,
our guys, us guys.

1225
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:43,654
It´s a club...

1226
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:48,242
so why don´t we just,
uh, have a drink? Hugh?

1227
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:50,619
No?

1228
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:52,996
You know, Hugh,
if you win this thing...

1229
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:55,958
you really gotta think about
where your kids go to school.

1230
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:58,919
We put our daughter in
Sidwell-Friends with Clinton´s.

1231
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:00,420
The Gores really like
St. Albans...

1232
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:02,047
but a public school
anywhere around Washington...

1233
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:03,549
is a disaster.

1234
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,260
CLARK: Excuse me, Senator.
If you don´t mind...

1235
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:08,804
I think we´re here to ask
about the news of your camp...

1236
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:11,181
JAY: News?

1237
00:57:11,223 --> 00:57:13,016
What are you talking about,
the news?

1238
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:14,643
Come on, the guys you and I
get our money from...

1239
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:16,103
they don´t want the people
to have the news.

1240
00:57:16,144 --> 00:57:17,604
They want you to think
that corporations...

1241
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:18,856
are more efficient
than government, right?

1242
00:57:18,897 --> 00:57:20,607
You want to know
why the health care industry...

1243
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:22,359
is the most profitable business
in the Unites States?

1244
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:24,695
´Cause the insurance companies
take 24 cents...

1245
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:26,238
out of every dollar
that´s spent.

1246
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,364
You know what
it takes the government...

1247
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:28,907
to do the same thing

01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:46,041
And rather than contend
for an agenda of his own...

1711
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:48,627
MURPHY: I think it´s important
for you to have longer pants.

1712
01:17:48,669 --> 01:17:51,505
As a matter of fact,
the shorter pants...

1713
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:54,508
have a certain, a certain
urban youthful quality, sir.

1714
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,343
The glasses are good,
but I don´t...

1715
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:57,803
I really wanna see your eyes.

1716
01:17:57,845 --> 01:17:59,429
The hat´s wonderful.
Like the hat.

1717
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:01,348
GARY: Budweiser on the blimp.

1718
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:03,684
They´re selling
´´get drunk and fly around. ´´

1719
01:18:03,809 --> 01:18:05,519
ANNOUNCER: The people
at Fidelity Providence...

1720
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:07,271
have been helping
support and protect families...

1721
01:18:07,312 --> 01:18:08,355
for over 100 years.

1722
01:18:08,397 --> 01:18:10,190
Senator, the glasses...

1723
01:18:10,232 --> 01:18:13,652
That´s the style, isn´t it?
That´s the style.

1724
01:18:13,694 --> 01:18:15,153
ANNOUNCER: . . By providing
a variety of health plans...

1725
01:18:15,195 --> 01:18:16,864
life insurance policies...

1726
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:19,199
real estate investments,
not only for families...

1727
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:21,660
but for the changing face
of America.

1728
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:24,788
You can trust Fidelity
Providence with your future.

1729
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:27,374
Welcome back.
In our Los Angeles studio...

1730
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:29,293
we have incumbent
Democratic Senator...

1731
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:31,170
Jay Bulworth of California.

1732
01:18:31,211 --> 01:18:32,379
Good evening, Senator.

1733
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:37,176
Senator,
why this new campaign style?

1734
01:18:39,761 --> 01:18:42,598
Why this new manner
of dress and speech?

1735
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:48,020
HOST: Your ethnic manner
of speech, your... your clothes...

1736
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:51,565
The use of obscenity.

1737
01:18:51,607 --> 01:18:53,066
Obscenity?

1738
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:55,152
GARY:
But, gee, my third cousin?

1739
01:18:55,194 --> 01:18:57,362
OK, he was. It´s true.
On the playground...

1740
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:59,865
and they´re tryin´ to get it
above the rim.

1741
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:02,159
I think it´s great.
I like it better.

1742
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:03,869
l´m not begrudging him that,
are you?

1743
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:06,079
Of course not.
Of course l´m not.

1744
01:19:06,121 --> 01:19:08,332
[Rapping] The rich is gettin´
richer and richer and richer

1745
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:10,501
While the middle class
is gettin´ more poor

1746
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:13,212
Just makin´ billions
and billions and billions

1747
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:15,881
And billions and billions
and billions of bucks

1748
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:17,257
Well, my friend

1749
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:20,260
lf, uh, you weren´t
already rich at the start

1750
01:19:20,302 --> 01:19:22,221
That... that... that situation sucks

1751
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:26,308
´Cause the... the richest
motherfucker in five of us

1752
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:28,519
Is gettin´ ninety-fuckin´
eight percent of it

1753
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,979
And every other motherfucker
in the world

1754
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:33,565
Is left to wonder where the fuck
we went with it

1755
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:34,733
Obscenity?

1756
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:35,943
l´m a senator

1757
01:19:35,984 --> 01:19:38,737
I gotta raise $10,000 a day
every day l´m in Washington

1758
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:40,155
I ain´t gettin´ it
in South Central

1759
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:41,990
l´m gettin´ it
in Beverly Hills

1760
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:44,493
So l´m votin´ in the Senate
the way they want me to

1761
01:19:44,535 --> 01:19:46,578
and... and... and
l´m sendin´ them my bills

1762
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,789
But we got babies
in South Central

1763
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:50,415
dyin´ as young
as they do in Peru

1764
01:19:50,457 --> 01:19:52,584
We got public schools
that are nightmares

1765
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:55,128
We got a Congress
that ain´t got a clue

1766
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:57,089
We got kids
with submachine guns

1767
01:19:57,130 --> 01:19:58,632
We got militias
throwing bombs

1768
01:19:58,674 --> 01:20:00,467
We got Bill
just gettin´ all weepy

1769
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:02,302
We got Newt blamin´ teenage moms

1770
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:04,137
We have factories closin´ down

1771
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:06,056
Where the hell
did all the good jobs go?

1772
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:07,599
Well, l´II tell you
where they went

1773
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:11,770
My contributors make more
profits makin´, makin´, makin´

1774
01:20:11,812 --> 01:20:13,105
Hirin´ kids in Mexico

1775
01:20:13,146 --> 01:20:15,148
Oh, brother can work
in fast food

1776
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,733
If he can´t invent
computer games

1777
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:18,318
But what we used
to call America

1778
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:19,653
That´s goin´ down the drains

1779
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:22,114
How´s a young man gonna meet
his financial responsibilities

1780
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:24,575
Workin´ in a motherfuckin´
Burger King? He ain´t!

1781
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:26,618
And please, don´t even
start with that school shit

1782
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,620
There ain´t no education
goin´ on up in that motherfucker

1783
01:20:28,704 --> 01:20:29,872
Obscenity?

1784
01:20:29,913 --> 01:20:31,582
We got a million brothers
in prison

1785
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:33,375
I mean,
the walls are really rockin´

1786
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:35,085
But you can bet your ass
they´d all be out

1787
01:20:35,127 --> 01:20:36,962
If they could pay
for Johnnie Cochran

1788
01:20:37,004 --> 01:20:38,964
The Constitution´s supposed
to give them an equal chance

1789
01:20:39,006 --> 01:20:40,465
Well, that ain´t gonna happen
for sure

1790
01:20:40,507 --> 01:20:42,718
Ain´t it time to take a little
from the rich motherfucker

1791
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:44,344
And just give a little
to the poor?

1792
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:46,013
I mean, those boys over there
on the monitor

1793
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:48,348
They want a government
smaller and weak

1794
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,184
But they be speaking
for the richest 20 percent

1795
01:20:50,225 --> 01:20:52,102
When they pretendin´
they defendin´ the meek

1796
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:54,730
Now, shit, fuck, cocksucker

1797
01:20:54,771 --> 01:20:55,939
That´s the real obscenity

1798
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:57,858
Black folks
livin´ with every day

1799
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,235
Is tryin´ to believe
a motherfuckin´ word

1800
01:21:00,277 --> 01:21:02,112
Democrats and Republicans say

1801
01:21:02,154 --> 01:21:03,614
Obscenity?

1802
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:05,699
l´m Jay Billington Bulworth

1803
01:21:05,741 --> 01:21:07,242
And l´ve come to say

1804
01:21:07,242 --> 01:21:08,952
The Democratic party´s

1805
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:10,954
Got some shit to pay

1806
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:13,999
It´s gonna pay it in the ghetto

1807
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:16,502
It´s gonna pay it in the...

1808
01:21:18,295 --> 01:21:20,714
Senator, are you saying
that the Democratic party...

1809
01:21:20,756 --> 01:21:21,924
doesn´t care about
the African-American community?

1810
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:24,426
JAY: Isn´t that obvious?
A lot of people think...

1811
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:26,512
there are no black leaders today
because they all got killed...

1812
01:21:26,553 --> 01:21:29,306
but I think it´s the decimation
of the manufacturing base...

1813
01:21:29,348 --> 01:21:30,474
in the urban centers.

1814
01:21:30,516 --> 01:21:31,934
Don´t you think so?

1815
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:33,435
[Whispering]
What do you think my age is?

1816
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:34,937
DIRECTOR:
He´s had his time. Flush ´im.

1817
01:21:34,978 --> 01:21:36,438
[Rapping]
You know, the guy in the booth

1818
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:37,981
Who´s talking to you
in that tiny little earphone?

1819
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:40,234
He´s afraid the guys at network
gonna tell him he´s through

1820
01:21:40,275 --> 01:21:42,569
If he lets a guy keep talking
like l´m talking to you

1821
01:21:42,611 --> 01:21:43,737
´Cause the corporations
got the networks

1822
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:46,240
And they get to say who gets
to talk about the country

1823
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:47,407
And who´s crazy today

1824
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:49,660
I would cut to a commercial
if you still want this job

1825
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:52,538
Because you may not be back
tomorrow with this corporate mob

1826
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:54,039
- Cut to a commercial
- OK, flush ´em.

1827
01:21:54,122 --> 01:21:56,917
Cut to commercial,
cut to commercial

1828
01:21:56,959 --> 01:21:58,210
Cut to commercial

1829
01:21:58,252 --> 01:21:59,920
OK, OK, I got a simple question

1830
01:21:59,962 --> 01:22:01,672
That l´d like to ask
of this network

1831
01:22:01,713 --> 01:22:03,841
That pays you
for performing your task

1832
01:22:03,882 --> 01:22:05,592
How come they got the airwaves?

1833
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:07,177
They´re the people´s,
aren´t they?

1834
01:22:07,219 --> 01:22:10,347
Wouldn´t they be worth
70 billion to the public today?

1835
01:22:10,389 --> 01:22:12,099
If some money-grubbin´ Congress

1836
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,685
Didn´t give ´em away
for big campaign money?

1837
01:22:14,726 --> 01:22:16,520
It´s hopeless, you see

1838
01:22:16,562 --> 01:22:18,522
If you runnin´ for office

1839
01:22:18,564 --> 01:22:20,107
Without no TV

1840
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:21,275
If you don´t get big money

1841
01:22:21,316 --> 01:22:22,651
You get a defeat

1842
01:22:22,693 --> 01:22:25,279
Corporations and broadcasters
make you dead meat

1843
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,198
You been taught in this country
there´s speech that is free

1844
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,618
But free do not get you
no spots on TV

1845
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:34,621
If you want to have senators
not on the take

1846
01:22:34,663 --> 01:22:36,623
Then give them free air time

1847
01:22:36,665 --> 01:22:38,458
They won´t have to fake

1848
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,919
Telecommunications
is the name of the beast

1849
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:42,337
That, that, that, that...

1850
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:44,882
That´s eatin´ up the world
from the West to the East

1851
01:22:44,923 --> 01:22:47,801
The movies, the tabloids,
TV, and magazines

1852
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:49,386
They tell us
what to think and do

1853
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:50,679
And all our hopes and dreams

1854
01:22:50,721 --> 01:22:53,140
All this information
makes America phat

1855
01:22:53,182 --> 01:22:54,683
But if the company´s
out of the country

1856
01:22:54,725 --> 01:22:56,059
How American is that?

1857
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:57,477
But we got Americans
with families

1858
01:22:57,519 --> 01:22:58,687
Can´t even buy a meal

1859
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:00,439
Ask a brother
who´s been downsized

1860
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,940
If he´s gettin´ any deal

01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:10,072
before tomorrow´s primary...

2017
01:32:10,113 --> 01:32:13,158
it appears to have decided to
keep its candidate under wraps.

2018
01:32:13,242 --> 01:32:14,576
JAY RAPPING: The real obscenity

2019
01:32:14,618 --> 01:32:16,620
Black folks livin´ with
every day

2020
01:32:16,662 --> 01:32:18,664
Is tryin´ to believe
a mother [bleep] word

2021
01:32:18,705 --> 01:32:20,374
Democrats and Republicans say

2022
01:32:20,415 --> 01:32:22,125
Obscenity?

2023
01:32:22,167 --> 01:32:24,086
l´m Jay Billington Bulworth

2024
01:32:24,127 --> 01:32:25,254
FELDMAN: Call the police?

2025
01:32:25,295 --> 01:32:27,381
MURPHY: Think an APB
on the Senator election night...

2026
01:32:27,422 --> 01:32:29,258
is the kind of press
we´re looking for?

2027
01:32:29,299 --> 01:32:31,426
TV REPORTER:
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?

2028
01:32:31,468 --> 01:32:33,220
SECOND REPORTER:
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?

2029
01:32:33,262 --> 01:32:35,097
REPORTER:
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?

2030
01:32:35,138 --> 01:32:37,182
That´s the question
everybody is asking...

2031
01:32:37,224 --> 01:32:38,350
this election day
after the Senator...

2032
01:32:38,392 --> 01:32:41,937
astonished the political
establishment yesterday...

2033
01:32:41,979 --> 01:32:43,522
by making no appearances.

2034
01:32:43,605 --> 01:32:46,149
Bulworth Campaign Chief
Dennis Murphy said...

2035
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:47,901
the Senator was behind
closed doors...

2036
01:32:47,943 --> 01:32:50,863
and would probably meet
with the press later today.

2037
01:32:50,904 --> 01:32:53,365
TV REPORTER: Good evening.
It´s California primary night.

2038
01:32:53,407 --> 01:32:54,575
The polls have closed...

2039
01:32:54,616 --> 01:32:56,493
and nobody´s seen
anything quite like it.

2040
01:32:56,535 --> 01:32:58,579
The big surprise
is Senator Jay Bulworth.

2041
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:00,372
Bulworth appears
not only to have won...

2042
01:33:00,414 --> 01:33:02,457
the Democratic
Senatorial nomination...

2043
01:33:02,499 --> 01:33:04,835
with a whopping 71%
of the vote...

2044
01:33:04,877 --> 01:33:07,421
he´s received 15%
of the Democratic vote...

2045
01:33:07,462 --> 01:33:11,049
and 8% of the Republican vote
as a write-in for president.

2046
01:33:11,091 --> 01:33:13,260
Bear in mind, Bulworth
has never expressed interest...

2047
01:33:13,302 --> 01:33:14,511
in running for president.

2048
01:33:14,553 --> 01:33:16,889
Political analysts from
the Bay Area to the Beltway...

2049
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:18,599
are scratching
their heads in wonder...

2050
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,268
over this unprecedented
turn of events.

2051
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:22,686
CHERYL: No, Nina´s no idiot.

2052
01:33:22,728 --> 01:33:24,021
If she was tryin´
to hide the Senator...

2053
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:25,272
then she´d just...

2054
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:30,360
What? If she were gonna hide
the Senator, what?

2055
01:33:33,655 --> 01:33:35,657
- Is he still sleepin´?
- Still sleepin´.

2056

and find out if he is here.

You got customers, man.

2061
01:33:50,005 --> 01:33:51,423
TV REPORTER:
Nobody seems to have seen him.

2062
01:33:51,465 --> 01:33:53,634
BO Y: L.D., man, come on.

2063
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:57,971
Ahem. What´s up?

2064
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:00,724
UNCLE TYRONE: The house

MOMMA DOLL:
They can´t see the flowers.

2067
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:04,978
UNCLE TYRONE:
Can´t show ´em in a close-up.

2068
01:34:04,978 --> 01:34:06,647
MOMMA DOLL: Why don´t they show
my flowers?

2069
01:34:06,688 --> 01:34:09,066
MURPHY: Hey, man, um...

2070
01:34:09,107 --> 01:34:11,527
it´s very important that I speak
with Senator Bulworth, sir.

2071
01:34:11,568 --> 01:34:12,694
Is... is he here?

2072
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,571
UNCLE TYRONE: Would you mind
waiting in the street?

2073
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:17,658
l... I can´t wait in the street.
Um, uh, l´m totally cool.

2074
01:34:17,699 --> 01:34:19,284
l´m the Senator´s
chief of staff.

2075

l´m not a member of the press,
and so...

2076
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:23,080
Momma Doll said
don´t mess up her flowers.

2077
01:34:23,121 --> 01:34:26,500
REPORTER:
Seems to be an impromptu powwow.

2078
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:28,168
Maybe we can get
some information.

2079
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:31,046
You know when we might expect
a statement from the Senator?

2080
01:34:31,088 --> 01:34:32,339
MURPHY: Very, very shortly,
I promise you.

2081
01:34:32,381 --> 01:34:35,425
MISSY: Murphy, Murphy.
It is worse than arrogance.

2082
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:37,469
It´s contempt.
It´s contempt for the press.

2083
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:40,180
He´s been missing two days.
Who do we call, Robert Stack?

2084
01:34:40,222 --> 01:34:42,516
What possible explanation
could possibly satisfy me?

2085
01:34:42,558 --> 01:34:44,101
None. Is he in that house?

2086
01:34:44,142 --> 01:34:45,769

Uh-oh, think we got a problem.

TV REPORTER: The group
of Bulworth Democrats...

2089
01:34:49,523 --> 01:34:50,816
agreed on one thing...

2090
01:34:50,858 --> 01:34:52,442
Leading is more important
than winning.

if you´d pan over here...

SECOND REPORTER: Clearly
everyone is tight-lipped here.

2094
01:34:58,657 --> 01:35:01,660
It´s still a mystery as to
what is going on in this house.

We are in South Central

This brother owes me money.

So you´re gonna have to wear
these casts right here.

And you got a choice
whether we break your legs.

he has not been seen.

of his political life.
