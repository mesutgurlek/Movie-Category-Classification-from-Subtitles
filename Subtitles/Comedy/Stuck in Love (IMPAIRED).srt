I remember that it hurt.

2
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:45,214
Looking at her hurt.

3
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:05,442
Your... your...
your nose.

00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:09,947
[whispers]
Oh, oh, it does that sometimes.

5
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:14,576
[school bell rings]

6
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,380
- Hey.
- Hi.

7
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:36,265
I never enjoy anything.

8
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:39,142
I'm always waiting for whatever's next.

9
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:40,644
I think everyone's like that...

10
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:42,187
living life in fast forward,

11
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:43,855
never stopping to enjoy the moment,

12
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,275
too busy trying to rush through everything,

13
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:49,778
so we can get on with what we're really
supposed to be doing with our lives.

14
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,990
I get these flashes of clarity, brilliant clarity,

15
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:55,158
where, for a second, I stop and I think,

16
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,327
"Wait, this is it.

17
00:01:57,411 --> 00:02:00,038
"This is my life. I'd better
slow down and enjoy it,

18
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:03,000
"because one day, we're all
going to end up in the ground,

19
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,335
"and that will be it.
We'll be gone.

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,840
So I think we should fuck.
[chokes]

21
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:12,092
Um... what?

22
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,761
Let's just fast forward through all
the drunken seduction bullshit...

23
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,680
we have to look forward to.

24
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:19,224
You don't look like you'd be very good at it anyway,

25
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,935
and I don't want to sit here and listen
to you bumblefuck your way through it.

26
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,146
We both want the same thing,

27
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:26,898
to go back to your room, have sex,
and never see each other again.

28
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:28,150
Are you with me?

29
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,609
Is this a trick?

30
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:31,111
The offer is about to expire.

31
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,571
No, no, I'm in.

32
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:33,864
I'm definitely in.

33
00:02:40,162 --> 00:02:41,121
Do you like that book?

34
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:42,831
No, God, no.

35
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,959
No, it's my idiot brother's favorite book.

36
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,878
Is it yours?
No, no.

37
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,379
It's my roommate's.

38
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:52,883
I'm not really much of a reader.

39
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,177
Good.

40
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,015
Now come here.
Yes, ma'am.

41

43
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:04,496
As I stood there staring through the window

44
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,456
into my ex-wife's
new life,

45
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,334
I was overcome by the oddest sensation.

46
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:12,838
Watching her with this man was
like turning on a familiar sitcom

47
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:17,092
and realizing they had replaced one
of the lead actors with a stranger.

48
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:20,220
The show was the same, but the
thespian who played William Borgens

49
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,306
for nearly twenty years was gone.

50
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,476
And in his place was a younger, dumber model.

51

[barks]
[gasps]

52

What was that, boy?

53
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:32,983
Oh, shit.

57
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,043
Oh yeah.

58
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,173
There you go.

59
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:45,013
You got that bowl?

60
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,192
Hey.

61
00:06:17,337 --> 00:06:20,632
Just rock it on there.
Get him on there.

62
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,050
Gentle, gentle.
There you go.

63
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,885
Got it?
Don't push that hard.

64
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,053
All right.

65
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:27,305
There we go.
Yeah.

70
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,589
Ready?

71
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:03,758
Hi, I'm back.

72
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:09,514
Dad...
[knocking]

73
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:15,270
Smells good.

74
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:23,486
Well, they said that you have to go back there?

75
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,949
They just said that I think you
might have to end up paying for it.

76
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,744
No, but they're going to cancel
the whole thing? The appointment?

77
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,996
Yeah, they're canceling it.
It's over, basically...

78
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,874
My book is being published!
[chokes]

79
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:41,504
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.

80
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,423
Thank you. Thanks, Dad.
Oh, my God.

81
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,258
We're so proud of you.

82
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:46,718
What house is it?
Scribner.

83
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,762
What?
That's King's publisher.

84
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:50,764
Yeah, no,
they're great. Great.

85
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,433
We got to have a toast. We have
to have a toast. Scribner?

86
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:56,853
Yeah, that's exactly what I was
thinking when I submitted the book.

87
00:07:56,936 --> 00:07:59,147
This will really piss Rusty off.

88
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,484
It's not because they publish books
by Hemingway or Kurt Vonnegut.

89
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,319
David McCullough, Frank McCourt.

90
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,530
F. Scott Fitzgerald,
Bob fucking Dylan.

91
00:08:07,614 --> 00:08:09,282
I didn't know you had dibs on Scribner.

92
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:10,909
I never said I had dibs, Samantha.

93
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,661
I just was...
You're just jealous.

94
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:14,079
Wow.
I'm not jealous.

95
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,122
What an accomplishment.

96
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:18,458
Your sister is having her first
book published, all right?

97
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,168
This is a cause for celebration.

98
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,878
This is what the holidays are all about.

99
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,421
Okay, cool.

100
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:24,964
You might want to congratulate her.

101
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:27,092
Congratulations.
Thank you.

102
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:29,511
Geez, I didn't have my first book published until...

103
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:33,306
I don't know.
I was 25 or 26.

104
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,933
I would have been happy to call those guys.

105
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,393
I know them all over there.

106
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,061
I submitted it under a fake name

107
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:39,854
and didn't tell them whose daughter I was

108
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:41,940
until after was accepted.
I wouldn't have minded.

109
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,817
I know. I just... Because you
wanted it to be about your book

110
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,527
and not about being my daughter.

111
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,947
Yeah. Okay, well, this
is a toast... psst.

112
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:52,534
To you and your first novel.

113
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,536
Just Saying Hi.

114
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,831
Oh, it's not Just Saying Hi.

115
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,708
Did they make you change the title?

116
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,168
No, they're not publishing Just Saying Hi.

117
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:04,212
It's a different book.

118
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,381
What?

119
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,718
I put that aside for now,

120
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:11,261
and I wrote a new one.

121
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:12,595
When?

122
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,222
Over the summer.

123
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:15,598
What happened to Just Saying Hi?

124
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:17,559
You were excited about that.

125
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,519
I was excit-- I put a lot of
work and effort into that.

126
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:21,062
I proofed the manuscript and I--

127
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:22,814
I know.
I'm sorry. I--

128
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:25,108
I..I..I thought my opinion
meant something.

129
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:27,485
It does. Dad.
You know it does.

130
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,155
And yet you turn around and write an entirely new book

131
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,157
and don't think to share it with me?

132
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:35,577
I'm sorry.
[sighs]

133
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:40,623
Something's burning.

134
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:48,548
Congratulations.

135
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,509
Why would you let him set that place at the table?

136
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:53,303
I set it.
He asked me to.

137
00:09:53,386 --> 00:09:55,096
Yeah, well, she's not coming.

138
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,098
I'm about to head over there.
You should come.

139
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,391
Give Dad a chance to cool off.

140
00:09:58,475 --> 00:09:59,809
I'm not going over there.

141
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:01,144
Fine.
Suit yourself.

142
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:02,562
I'll tell her you said hi.

143
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:04,063
You can tell Mom to drop dead.

144
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,608
[inhales]
Whoa...

145
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:14,407
[car radio]

146
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,216
This food is so good.

147
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:35,303
[mother]
Glad you like it.

148
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:37,430
So how did everything go over at your Dad's?

149
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:41,309
It was good. Sam's getting
a book published.

150
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:43,394
What?

151
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:45,313
That was my reaction, too.

152
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:47,732
That's great.

153
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:50,777
I always thought your dad making you
and your sister keep journals was...

154
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,738
a little strange, but...

155
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:55,490
sounds like it's paying off.

156
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,242
I can't believe it.

157
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,576
Rusty, just let that go.

158
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,453
No, why is it strange?

159
00:11:00,537 --> 00:11:02,497
I just want to know why you think it's so strange.

160
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,916
Well, it just seems like he was forcing you

161
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:06,584
to be writers...

162
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:08,628
instead of allowing you to choose to be.

163
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,545
We don't have to keep the journals if we don't want to.

164
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,423
You'd have to get a job if you stopped.

165
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:14,551
He pays us to do it so we can focus on our writing

166
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,761
instead of working some bullshit job at McDonald's.

167
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:19,180
Rusty...

168
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,307
What?

169
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:22,684
What?

170
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,185
Are you stoned?

171
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:26,271
Are you kidding?
Are you being...

172
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:29,190
I'm not stoned. Rusty, I'd like
to talk to you in the kitchen.

173
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:30,942
I think you're stoned.

174
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:33,069
Great. Good.
I'm going.

175
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,657
[sighs]

176
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,701
What's gotten into you?

177
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:41,452
I'm not going to let that Neanderthal...

178
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:43,580
talk about Dad like that.

179
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,373
He didn't say anything about your father.

180
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,667
It's not what he says.

181
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,378
It's how he talks about him like he's
some sort of weirdo or something.

182
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,255
And watching football doesn't make you a Neanderthal.

183
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:53,464
Owning his own gym does.

184
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:55,258
Okay, enough.
Enough.

185
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,390
Is Sam's book really getting published?

186
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:04,100
That's what she said.

187
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,352
[laughs]
Wow.

188
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:13,526
It's been over a year since we spoke.

189
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,903
I know.

190
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,990
She said to say hi to you.

191
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:23,411
I don't believe that for a second, but...

192
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:26,039
it's very sweet of you to say.

193
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:28,458
Aw, Mom.
[sobs]

194
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,544
Please don't ever hate me the way she hates me.

195
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:33,296
I don't hate you at all, Mom.

196
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:38,426
Good, but you are stoned, though, aren't you.

197
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,512
I thought it would make it easier to eat again.

198
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:44,223
Pot and nothing else, ever, you understand me?

199
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,642
You don't have to worry about me, Mom.

200
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:47,185
[whispers]
Yeah, I do.

201
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:48,853
It's my job.

202
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:59,280
I cleared the table and started the dishes.

203
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:02,533
Sorry I reacted the way I did.

204
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:04,202
I was just surprised.

205
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,745
I thought you were happy with the book.

206
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,497
I was.

207
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,917
It just didn't seem like my book anymore.

208
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,253
It felt like someone else's.

209
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,548
My editorial hand a little
heavy for you? Yes, Dad.

210
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:24,097
I was scared of how you'd react,

211
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,101
and I felt guilty because of all the
work you put into Just Saying Hi.

212
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,812
I'm sorry...
Stop apologizing.

213
00:13:33,648 --> 00:13:37,610
It's my fault for involving myself in
your goddamn book in the first place.

214
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:42,365
[sighs] I'm guessing you don't want to read the new one?

215
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,327
Fuck no.

216
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:49,497
Never?
No, thank you.

217
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,999
I brought you a hard copy.

218
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:52,792
Really?
Yeah.

219
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,503
I was going to sign it for you if you wanted,

220
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:59,048
or not...
but maybe?

221
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:00,550
Leave it on my desk.

222
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:08,725
Wait... can I ask you a question
without you getting defensive?

223
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,397
What?

224
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,858
Rusty told me Martin called the
cops on a prowler the other night.

225
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:22,196
Dad, you've got to stop doing this to yourself.
It's been two years.

226
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,407
She's coming back. You're
completely delusional.

227
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,367
And what's with setting a place for her at the table?

228
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:28,786
That's fucking nuts. You
know they're fighting again?

229
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,996
And where did you see that?

230
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,998
Through their window?

231
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,333
Really? People get arrested
for doing things like that.

232
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,044
You're a well respected novelist.

233
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:38,129
You've won the PEN Faulkner Award twice.

234
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,672
You can't behave like that.

235
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:41,466
She's coming back.

236
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,718
Jesus, at least tell me you've been writing.

237
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,972
Look at what you've let her do to you, Dad.

238
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:52,560
Seriously.

239
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:07,200
[knocking]

240
00:15:07,325 --> 00:15:11,120
Hey. What are you working on?

241
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:14,207
It's a poem for English class.

242
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:17,251
Sorry about earlier.
I was being a dick.

243
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:18,878
It's okay.

244
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,505
Yeah, you were right.
I was just jealous.

245
00:15:20,588 --> 00:15:22,632
I really am happy for you.
It's awesome.

246
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:25,134
You're going to have a book
published one day, too, you know.

247
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:26,260
Sure, I know.

248
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,139
Jason hooked me up with some weed.

249
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,143
Roof?

250
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:38,439
Got your eye on any girls this year?

251
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,236
Yeah, there's this girl...

252
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:47,865
Kate, in my English class.

253
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:50,243
Every time I see her, I hear that song,

254
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:53,412
the Beatles' song, "I've Just Seen a
Face," playing in my head. [coughs]

255
00:15:53,496 --> 00:15:55,289
God, you are so pathetic.

256
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:57,041
At least I know I'm pathetic.

257
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,793
Let me give you some advice.

258
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,086
I can't wait to hear your advice.

259
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,547
It's so friggin' awesome.

260
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,091
There are two kinds of people in this world.

261
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:09,303
Hopeless romantics and realists.
Right.

262
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:11,806
A realist just sees that face

263
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,059
and packs it in with every other
pretty girl they've ever seen before.

264
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:18,437
The hopeless romantic becomes convinced

265
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:22,233
that God put them on Earth to be with that one person.

266
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,694
But there is no God,

267
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:29,073
and life is only as meaningful as you
fool yourself into thinking it is.

268
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:31,826
Guys who get laid a lot are realists.

269
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,703
You should be listening.

270
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,124
Just avoid love at all costs.

271
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:39,500
That's my motto.

272
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:45,923
Never been in lave?

273
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:49,177
If love is setting a place at the table
for someone who is never coming home,

274
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,761
I think I'll pass.

275
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:54,432
That's fucking depressing, Sam.

276
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,602
Making students read their poetry
assignments in front of the class

277
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,812
is a sadistic exercise in public humiliation.

278
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:01,772
You could have already been done with it by now, Rusty.

279
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,441
Okay, okay, okay.
Just read it.

280
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,484
[groans]

281
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:10,072
Um, okay, this is a poem I wrote over Thanksgiving break.

282
00:17:10,156 --> 00:17:13,743
Uh...
It's called School.

283
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:16,287
It was written under the influence of cannabis.

284
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,623
[students laugh]

285
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:22,627
Okay, um... In the sea
of... This is so awkward.

286
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,629
Uh...
[groans]

287
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,465
"In the sea of desks, there's talk of games and bags

288
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:32,345
"and long pipes that leak dreams
with the strike of a match.

289
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:34,555
"And there's a loudness to the whispers I hear.

290
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:37,850
"Whispers shouldn't be that loud, should they?

291
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:39,977
"There's a girl over there who everyone knows

292
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:44,190
"and men without ears who will
stand by the door for a price.

293
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,568
"In long hallways, there are
angry mobs of dwarves and rats

294
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:49,278
"and one single angel."

295
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,538
Hey, Rusty. Hi.

296
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:04,168
Hi. Hi, I, um... I
liked your poem.

297
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:07,838
Yeah?
Yeah, it was really good.

298
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:11,384
Thanks.
Sure.

299
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,803
How was your Thanksgiving?

300
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:16,514
Oh, it was good.
It was a little weird.

301
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,850
My parents are divorced, sol have two Thanksgivings

302
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,519
in one Thanksgiving.

303
00:18:21,644 --> 00:18:23,354
It's just, like, strange.
[giggles]

304
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,064
How about you?

305
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,316
It was just boring. Whatever.
That's cool.

306
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,485
[whispers]
Yeah.

307
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:32,530
Kate.

308
00:18:32,613 --> 00:18:34,490
I have to go.

309
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:38,828
I just wanted to say I liked your poem, so...

310
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:40,955
Bye.
All right.

311
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:44,834
Who the fuck is that?

312
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,460
Just a guy from class.

313
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,923
Fucking asshole.

314
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:04,395
Hi.

315
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,940
I literally have 20 minutes, so it will have to be quick.

316
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,400
Come on.
Let's go.

317
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,443
Did you stretch?

318
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:16,824
Come on.

319
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,203
Just a second.

320
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:23,039
Oh, yeah.

321
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:24,915
Oh, make it rain.

322
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,168
Yeah.
[gasps]

323
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,173
Yeah.
To the left.

324
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,091
To the...
yeah.

325
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,513
Yes!

326
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:51,442
All right, I got to run.

327
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:53,652
Thursday, be ready.

328
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:55,696
Yes, Sarah.

329
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,865
[door closes]

330
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:04,372
[loud rock music in ear buds]

331
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:07,083
Hey!

332
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,001
Hey!
Goddamn it!

333
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,669
What are you doing?

334
00:20:10,753 --> 00:20:12,004
You scared me.
I caught you.

335
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:13,756
You're reading my journal.

336
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,591
You promised you'd never read our journals.

337
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,259
Sorry. I trusted you, Dad.

338
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:19,011
I'm sorry. That pisses
me off so much.

339
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,013
I'm sorry. It's an
invasion of privacy.

340
00:20:21,097 --> 00:20:23,224
Rusty, I--I--I-- Sit down for a second.
Let me explain.

341
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,934
No, I'm not going to sit down.

342
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,936
Okay, okay. I wasn't
reading your journal.

343
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,896
I--I flipped it open to check
the dates like I always do

344
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,315
and something jumped out at me

345
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:33,859
and--and--and grabbed me.
I'm sorry, okay?

346
00:20:33,943 --> 00:20:35,736
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,322
What?

348
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:39,407
May I?

349
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,709
"I remember that it hurt.

350
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:52,378
"Looking at her hurt."

351
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,464
That's it.

352
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:59,301
If that was the opening line of a
book, you'd have your reader hooked.

353
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,846
They would have to keep reading.
I had to keep reading. Sorry.

354
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,889
Flattery is not going to get you out of this.

355
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:05,850
No, no, that's coming to an end right now.

356
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:08,227
You know Flannery O'Connor?
I know Flannery O'Connor.

357
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,855
She said nothing needed to happen in
a writer's life after they were 20.

358
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,107
By then, they had experienced more than enough

359
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,734
to last
their creative life. So?

360
00:21:15,818 --> 00:21:16,944
So what's your point?

361
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,029
My point is...

362
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:21,282
Sit down for a second, please.

363
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,745
Rusty...
[sighs]

364
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:29,707
I don't think you're experiencing enough.

365
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,878
I mean, the reason that you're comfortable
leaving your goddamn journal on my desk

366
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,922
is because there's nothing you're
trying to hide from me in your life.

367
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:40,176
And that really worries me, you know?

368
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,387
Sweet, sensitive guys like you, they
spend their entire high school years

369
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:45,473
frozen in place while...

370
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,349
everybody is running around going to parties

371
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:50,352
and getting laid, doing whatever.

372
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:52,104
I don't want you to look back years from now

373
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:55,316
and think about this girl.
Is it Kate? Yeah.

374
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,901
Tell this girl how you feel.

375
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,528
Put your heart on the line.

376
00:21:59,612 --> 00:22:01,363
It's not that easy.

377
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:03,365
It is, too. It is, too.
Look at your sister.

378
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:05,034
You can...
Hey!

379
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:06,494
You can roll your eyes all you want.

380
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:08,370
Your sister is a great writer.

381
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:10,372
And it's because she's courageous in her life.

382
00:22:10,456 --> 00:22:12,708
She's promiscuous, Dad.
It's not the same thing.

383
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:16,003
Rusty, a writer is the sum of their experiences.

384
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,298
Go get some.

385
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,258
It will be fun.

386
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:23,177
Come on. This is crazy. What
are we doing here, man?

387
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,803
Everyone hates us.

388
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:26,430
Not tonight, they don't.
Not tonight.

389
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:32,436
What?

390
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,979
Uh, we're here for the party.

391
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:37,191
What party?

392
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:39,235
Dude, come on man. I'm, like,
in three classes with you.

393
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:42,196
Fuck off.

394
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,657
Okay, but...

395
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,369
what are going to do with all this weed?

396
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,745
I was just playing, man.
Come on.

397
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,413
Really? Yeah. Come on in.

398
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,132
Hey! Hey, my boys...

399
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:03,384
Wait.
What's your name?

400
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,844
Rusty.
This is Jason.

401
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:09,139
Hey, my boys Rusty and Jason just
brought us a shitload of weed.

402
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:11,058
Your name is Rodney, right?

403
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,102
Hey, man, Rodney.
What's up?

404
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:15,354
You make sure with Jason that everybody gets some, okay?

405
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,939
Where you going?

406
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:18,524
I'm going to go find my friend, Kate.

407
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,901
Which chick?
Oh, they still upstairs!

408
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,864
Dude, who are you?

409
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:28,117
I'm a new and improved Rusty Borgens.

me a message after the beep.

00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:48,739
Glen, open the door.

417
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:51,158
I've been waiting for ten minutes.
Come on.

418
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,118
Could I have a fucking second please?

419
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:55,245
No, I can't give you a fucking second.
I'm in pain.

420
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,101
Shut the fucking door!

421
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,156
Let's go, Jason. Let's
get out of here.

422
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,033
Dude, I'm not going anywhere.
Let's go.

423
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:35,077
I'm not going anywhere.
That plan was genius, dude.

424
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,787
It was a joke.
It wasn't a fucking joke.

425
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,207
It's not funny.
Get the fuck off me.

426
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,667
Hey, don't walk away from me.

427
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,043
Stop.
You're crazy.

428
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:44,962
Quit following me, Glen.

429
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,089
This is my house. I can go
wherever the fuck I want.

430
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,341
All right, big shot. Listen, I'm
leaving, all right, asshole?

431
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:50,692
Get the fuck out of here.
[crowd gasps]

432
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,344
Hey, asshole.

433
00:25:52,428 --> 00:25:54,096
[crowd yells]

434
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:01,937
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

435
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,605
Okay, come on.

436
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,607
Let me grab that.

437
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:10,362
Run, run!

438
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:11,739
I'm going to fucking kill you.

439
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,617
Dude, dude, fuck yeah, man!

440
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:21,540
All right.
Later, man.

441
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:23,208
See you, buddy.
Later.

442
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:28,964
Hey, asshole!
Boom!

443
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:35,929
I can't go home like this.

444
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:41,518
I'm a wreck. My knees are
all banged up and I'm high.

445
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:46,565
Yeah, we should probably get some ice on those.

446
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,942
Can I stay at your house tonight?

447
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,613
Okay.

448
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:59,787
[eerie cell phone ring]

449
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:04,374
Hello?

450
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,836
[Erica]
Hi. Hi, it's me.

451
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,589
Hey, you okay?

452
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,801
Um, where are you?

453
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,721
I'm here.
I'm at home.

454
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:20,140
Oh, I've been ringing the bell.

455
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,851
I fell asleep.
Are you here?

456
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:31,026
All right, we need to put our heads together.

457
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,695
Okay.
Bill, I can't sleep.

458
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,949
Okay, I'm driving around in my
pajamas in the middle of the night.

459
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:39,910
I'm like a crazy person. I
can't live like this anymore.

460
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,787
I can't either.

461
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,039
I've given her space.

462
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,708
I accept her hatred towards me as
some phase she's going through,

463
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:48,627
but this isn't a phase.

464
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,838
She has this amazing thing going on with her life now

465
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:53,090
with this book being published,
and I can't share that with her.

466
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:54,508
She won't return my calls.

467
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,051
She won't return my emails.

468
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,803
She's-she's having
a book published.

469
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,680
She's busy.
Bullshit.

470
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,515
I can't get her to return my calls.
Bullshit.

471
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:04,017
She's petty and she's cruel.

472
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:05,519
Everyone's parents are divorced.

473
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:06,937
Big fucking deal.
You get over it.

474
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,063
She fights with me, too.

475
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,898
We're not fighting.

476
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,984
That's the thing. I wish
I could fight with her.

477
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,944
Then I'd be an active participant in her life.

478
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,113
She just abandoned me.

479
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,448
No, I don't think... She's abandoned you?
That seems horrible.

480
00:28:18,532 --> 00:28:21,451
You are in a constant state of denial about everything.

481
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,912
Bill, she acts like I don't exist.

482
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,956
I haven't spoken to her in over a year

483
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,916
and you're not helping things.

484
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,751
Me? I haven't said one thing.
I--I-- What did I--

485
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,796
You set a place for me
at Thanksgiving. Yeah.

486
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,506
So everytime she comes home from school,

487
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,592
she sees you miserable and moping

488
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,594
and she blames me.
I know she blames me.

489
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:39,761
I know she does.
I don't mope.

490
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:41,471
Oh, you mope.

491
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:42,890
You mope.

492
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,641
Say horrible things about me,

493
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,602
but don't try to win her sympathy this way.

494
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:49,187
Hey, I made a promise to you and I intend to keep it.

495
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:52,691
Oh, Jesus.
Bill...

496
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:56,737
That was a lifetime ago.

497
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,281
I release you from your promise.

498
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:03,201
Please... go on
with your life.

499
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:04,620
Go get laid.
I get laid.

500
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,414
Great! You get laid? Mm-hmm.

501
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:09,625
Well, then, be happy.

502
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:10,834
I just want you to be happy.

503
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:12,336
I was happy with you.

504
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,046
You were the one who wasn't happy.

505
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:17,215
Well, I'm happy now.

506
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,509
You don't look happy to me.

507
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:23,680
When? When you're sneaking
around our house at night?

508
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:29,645
I see you and Martin fighting.

509
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,271
Shut up, Bill.

510
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:44,534
Oh, hey.
Wait a minute.

511
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:45,869
Excuse me.

512
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,164
You know I--

513
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,749
I don't mean to be presumptuous,

514
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,794
but I wouldn't do that if I were you.

515
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:56,129
I mean, he sleeps with a lot of girls.

516
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,715
You're practically guaranteed to wake up with a rash.

517
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,342
Thanks for the tip.

518
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,010
I see you you getting snared in his web.

519
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,054
You look like a nice girl and all, so.

520
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:05,722
I'm not a nice girl.

521
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:07,849
Well, in that case, I'm Louis.

522
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:10,644
Everyone calls me Lou.
Nice to meet you.

523
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,354
No? Okay.

524
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,439
Look, I don't want to hurt your feelings,

525
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:15,941
but you're wasting your time.

526
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:17,776
What, talking is a waste of time?

527
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,486
We're not talking.

528
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,113
You're flirting with me.

529
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:23,323
And you're also cockblocking your friend.

530
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:25,617
Huh?
Bon Jovi over there?

531
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,536
He's not my friend.
He's a dick, actually.

532
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,788
I'm just filling in on bass for them tonight.

533
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,999
You're cute, Lou.

534
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:34,710
But you reek of romance and good intentions.

535
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:36,336
I'm not looking for a nice guy.

536
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,046
I don't do boyfriends, and I don't date.

537
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,966
All I heard was don't, don't, don't, don't.

538
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:43,051
Well, don’t keep people safe.

539
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,553
I'm going to go.

540
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:47,305
Okay, well, I'll see you in class.

541
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,016
Do we have a class together?

542
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,435
Advanced Fiction Writing.

543
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,062
I don't remember you.
Well, I remember you.

544
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:57,566
You have a book that's getting published.
Your dad must be thrilled.

545
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,484
You know an awful lot about me, Lou.

546
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:02,404
We writers are an envious bunch, so...

547
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:03,739
What's his name?

548
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,744
His name is Pete.

549
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:11,288
Have fun.
I will.

550
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,208
Cool. You're awesome.

551
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,217
I didn't know you lived at the beach.
Shh-shh.

552
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,802
[whispers]
Keep your voice down.

553
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:27,679
I just don't want to wake my dad up.

554
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:30,807
I'm going to go get some ice for that.

555
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:37,856
There you go.
Thank you.

556
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,819
Sure.

557
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:44,321
Rusty?

558
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,990
Hey, Dad, what are you doing up?

559
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:48,784
Who's this?

560
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:52,454
Uh, Dad, this is Kate.
Kate, this is Dad.

561
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,289
Hi.

562
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:57,042
Hi.

563
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,543
What happened to your knees?

564
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:01,213
She fell. This
asshole pushed me.

565
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,632
Really?
Somebody pushed you?

566
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:07,177
Yeah, but it's okay, because Rusty punched him.

567
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,347
Oh, good. Nobody should ever push
a girl and get away with it.

568
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,807
That's a good start, that ice.

569
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:14,559
We have some peroxide in here.

570
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,520
So you are Kate.

571
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,230
Rusty's fold me a lot about you.

572
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:21,399
He has? Um...

573
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,276
We hardly know each other.

574
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,028
I just know he thinks very highly of you.

575
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:28,240
Dad?
Sorry, sorry.

576
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:29,699
Are you staying the night?

577
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:33,078
Uh, yeah, if that's okay.

578
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:36,081
Okay. Your parents
don't mind?

579
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,125
No.

580
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:42,087
All right. You take the bed
and she takes the couch...

581
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,715
Or the other way. You take the
couch and she takes the bed.

582
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,051
Whichever one.

583
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,344
Nice meeting you, Kate.

584
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:53,974
You, too.
Goodnight.

585
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,350
Sorry.

586
00:32:57,477 --> 00:32:58,728
Your dad's nice.

587
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,522
Yeah, he's a good guy.

588
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:03,775
What does he do?

589
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:07,070
Uh... he's a writer.

590
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,864
Like a real one?

591
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:10,907
Yeah, he wrote a book called Suit Monkeys.

592
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,910
Won some awards, had a bunch
of books published. Thanks.

593
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:17,080
Whoa, uh...

594
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,666
I didn't know you were going
to... I'll turn around.

595
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,502
Well, that's cool.

596
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,546
Is that what you want to do?

597
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:26,840
Uh, yeah.
I'm a writer, too.

598
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:28,717
So is my sister.

599
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,678
We write books and stories and stuff.

600
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,889
Poetry?

601
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:35,765
Yeah.

602
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:37,267
Where's your sister?

603
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:40,061
She's, you know, away at college.

604
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:44,107
Yeah, so I--

605
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:48,570
Wait, can you stay with me a second?

606
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,113
Please?

607
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,365
Yeah, sure.

608
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:02,918
You can come closer.
I don't bite.

609
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,553
I have a question.

610
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,263
Yeah...

611
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,269
Was I the angel in the poem you wrote?

612
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,273
Yeah.

613
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:48,922
I think you're going to be very good for me.

614
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,134
Goodnight.

I love Christmas.

617
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,898
You strike me as one of those people.

618
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:52,569
I am. I'm definitely
one of those people.

619
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,738
I love everything about it.

620
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:58,033
I love the lights, the decorations,

I get all depressed during the holidays.

626
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:20,680
Yeah, well, you're divorced, Bill.
It's depressing.

627
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:25,602
Hey, can I give you a little bit of advice?

628

Just from one fuckbuddy to another.

Mm-hmm.

630
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,443
You need to remarry.

631

Hmm.
Mm-hmm.

newspapers for personal ads.

I haven't been on a date in 25 years.

636
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,000
Yeah, but what is that?

637
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,002
Listen, you're handsome, you're successful.

638
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:52,879
You have a mild amount of celebrity,

639
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,799
which is really all a writer can ask for.

640

but she married someone else,

00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,899
and you have to start thinking about your future

647
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:16,736
and whether or not you want that to be a happy one.

648
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,114
Because I don't want to jog by in five years

649
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:21,658
and find you waiting on that lawn chair for me.

650
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:23,785
It's a very comfortable lawn chair.

651
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:25,078
Is it?

652
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:26,913
Just think about it.

653
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,845
Procreation. You give to the
next one down the line.

654
00:37:41,928 --> 00:37:43,430
That's really all we've got.

655
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:45,807
Society, government, money, religion,

656
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,393
careers, nuclear families, monogamy.

657
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:51,729
These are all just highly creative
socially accepted delusions

658
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:56,234
that we impose on reality to try and gain
some semblance of control over our lives.

659
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:58,236
It gives us the illusion of choice.

660
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:01,948
It makes us feel a little less like animals.

661
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:04,409
Animals. What do you mean?
Like evolution?

662
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:06,411
Yeah, evolution, exactly.

663
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:08,246
I do not believe in evolution.

664
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:11,082
There's 400 billion stars in the Milky Way alone,

665
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,084
making the amount of stars in the entire universe

666
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,503
completely mindboggling.

667
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:17,380
We are nothing.

668
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,507
If an asteroid hadn't hit Earth 65 million years ago

669
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:20,884
and wiped out all the dinosaurs,

670
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,886
we wouldn't be here.

671
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:25,555
Yeah.
I'm going to go.

672
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:31,102
Good. All you creationists do is
blow chances at getting laid.

673
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:34,814
Really.
Ooh, that was awkward.

674
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:36,983
You've really got to stop stalking me.

675
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,903
I can't even go anywhere without
you showing up to annoy me.

676
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:42,530
Were you hitting on that guy?
It's none of your business.

677
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,073
I think he's a Mormon.

678
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:45,742
Well, what the hell is he doing here?

679
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:47,827
Trying to find other Mormon girls.

680
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:51,623
I'm sure you corrupted him,
ruined his relationship with God.

681
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,124
You want to get out of here?

682
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,376
Do you have brain damage?

683
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,420
No. I think I made
it pretty clear

684
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:59,589
that I have absolutely no interest in going out with you.

685
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:01,841
No, no, no. You and I
are going to be friends.

686
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:03,676
But I don't want to be friends with you.

687
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,179
[whispers]
Oh, you don't want to be.

688
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:08,306
Well, I'm going to take your jacket

689
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,517
and you can follow me. We can
get some coffee if you'd like.

690
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,770
I need that...

691
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,313
jacket

692
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:19,275
What are some of your favorite books?

693
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,861
Is that really the angle you're going to play?

694
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:25,573
Really? I thought you'd be
more creative than this.

695
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:29,410
Well, come on, we're writers, right?
Yeah.

696
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:32,205
Books matter to us. I mean,
come on here, please.

697
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:35,708
Fine, what are some of your favorite books?

698
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:37,669
No, you can't do that.
I asked you.

699
00:39:37,752 --> 00:39:39,754
Because you want to know something personal about me.

700
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:42,048
If I tell you what my favorite books are,

701
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,342
you'll say titles that will
convince me that we're soulmates,

702
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,344
or you'll latch onto one of my favorites

703
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:48,263
and try to convince me it's one of your favorites, too.

704
00:39:48,346 --> 00:39:49,722
God, you're so tough.

705
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:51,099
It's why you're obsessed with me.

706
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:52,433
I'm not obsessed with you.

707
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:54,060
I'm like a unicorn to you.

708
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:55,895
You'll do or say anything to possess me.

709
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,189
I'm not like that and you're not like a unicorn.

710
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,149
Okay, well, then books.

711
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:02,360
But please, at least attempt to be interesting.

712
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:04,862
No Catcher in the Rye or Portnoy's Complaint, okay?

713
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:09,200
Well, I write mysteries, so...

714
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:12,203
I love Elmore Leonard, James Lee Burke,

715
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:13,871
Ed Brubaker.

716
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:16,332
Who's Ed Brubaker.

717
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:20,211
He writes an incredible, hard-boiled
crime comic called Criminal.

718
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:22,505
Telling me that you read comic books

719
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:25,174
isn't exactly sweeping me off my feet.

720
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:27,218
What's your favorite book?

721
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:28,969
Just say the first thing that pops into your head.

722
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:32,432
Dear Mr. Henshaw
by Beverly Cleary.

723
00:40:34,142 --> 00:40:36,311
Been my favorite since I was a kid.

724
00:40:36,394 --> 00:40:38,146
Read it, like, 100 times.

725
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,107
It's actually what made me want to be a writer.

726
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:43,359
Hey, is something wrong?

727
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:45,361
I have to go.

728
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,196
Well, what... what do you mean?
Did I do something?

729
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,698
I have to go.

730
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:49,824
Samantha.

731
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,412
Samantha, wait. Come on. What?

732
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:56,122
What do you want from me?

733
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:57,665
What do you mean what do I want from you?

734
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,208
I like you.

735
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,960
I want to get to know you better.
No.

736
00:41:01,085 --> 00:41:02,920
Why do you keep running away?
Because this...

737
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:04,964
whatever this is between us, it can't go any further.

738
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:07,759
I won't let it. We're not
even in the same species.

739
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:10,553
Is Dear Mr. Henshaw
your favorite book, too?

740
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:12,221
I don't do this, Lou.

741
00:41:12,305 --> 00:41:13,723
No.
No, of course not.

742
00:41:13,806 --> 00:41:15,558
You just give yourself away

743
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:17,810
to assholes with infinitely lower IQs than yours.

744
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,401
Fuck.

745
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:28,696
[knocking]

746
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,115
Hi.
Hi.

747
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:34,452
Is your dad here?

748
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:35,953
Uh, no...

749
00:41:36,037 --> 00:41:38,581
Well, when is he going to be back?

750
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:42,126
I don't know. Maybe
a couple of hours.

751
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,795
Why?

752
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:47,674
I want to give you your Christmas present.

753
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,929
Um, okay.

754
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:04,649
Merry Christmas.

755
00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:07,110
Oh...
awesome.

756
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:09,362
Come with me.

757
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,780
Where are we going?

758
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:12,448
To the closet.

759
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:15,034
Wait, why the closet?
Why not on the bed?

760
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,328
Can we open it?
[laughs]

761
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:22,542
Because you've never had sex,

762
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:27,505
and I've never had sex in a closet.

763
00:42:27,588 --> 00:42:32,051
You'll remember me and you'll remember this moment

764
00:42:32,135 --> 00:42:35,054
and that makes me very, very happy.

765
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,900
[Rusty and Kate laughing]

766
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:24,228
Oh, fuck.

767
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:33,279
Hi.

768
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:37,617
How's she feeling?

769
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,203
She's okay. You
should go see her.

770
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:00,348
How you feeling?

771
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:04,477
Not too bad.

772
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,062
Don't bullshit me.

773
00:44:06,145 --> 00:44:08,147
I'm like a no bullshit detector here.

774
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:11,025
I'm fine.

775
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,736
Shut up and read to me. Okay.

776
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:28,835
"Dalie Hallie couldn't tell if she felt huge or small.

777
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:31,337
"She wondered whether her head

778
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,882
"were so big as to be able to
contain all this starry universe...

779
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:37,552
"or if the universe were so little that it would fit

780
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:40,179
"within the compass
of her human head."

781
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:42,890
Lou?

782
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:45,601
Do you see that angel by the door

783
00:44:45,685 --> 00:44:47,854
or am I the only one seeing her?

784
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:58,072
Oh, that... that's definitely
not an angel, Mom.

785
00:45:04,245 --> 00:45:06,706
Hi.
Hi.

786
00:45:06,831 --> 00:45:09,208
Hi. What are you doing here?

787
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:11,919
Oh, same thing you're doing, I hope.

788
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:13,504
Don't be suspicious.

789
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:16,340
I'm getting a laptop for Samantha.

790
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:19,302
In fact, I got to pick out a color.
Why don't you come?

791
00:45:19,385 --> 00:45:21,137
I don't know.
Excuse me.

792
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,556
Huh?
What don't you know?

793
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:26,601
I don't know if it's a good idea, Bill.

794
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:29,478
It will take ten minutes.

795
00:45:29,562 --> 00:45:30,813
I'd love to.
Yeah.

796
00:45:30,897 --> 00:45:33,232
Yeah?
Yeah, I'd love to.

797
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:35,860
I'm glad I bumped into you.

798
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:38,362
I'm sure that's what all stalkers say.

799
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:41,824
No, really.

800
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:44,118
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.

801
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:46,245
Really?
Mm-hmm.

802
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:48,539
Somebody else said the same thing recently.

803
00:45:48,623 --> 00:45:51,667
Someone else asked you to stop
hanging around their house at night?

804
00:45:53,377 --> 00:45:55,338
About moving on with my life.

805
00:45:57,381 --> 00:45:59,300
Who was that?

806
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:01,093
Tricia Wolcott.

807
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:02,887
Lives about a mile and a half down the beach.

808
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:04,805
Yeah, I remember her.
Yeah.

809
00:46:04,889 --> 00:46:07,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

810
00:46:07,934 --> 00:46:10,770
I always suspected you had a crush on her.

811
00:46:10,853 --> 00:46:12,647
Yeah, she's very pretty.

812
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,441
She's very married, as I recall.

813
00:46:17,693 --> 00:46:19,403
You're seeing her?

814
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:21,238
I think I'm a good way for her to kill an hour

815
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:23,115
after she drops her kids off at school.

816
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:25,660
An hour?

817
00:46:25,743 --> 00:46:27,662
An hour.

818
00:46:27,745 --> 00:46:31,874
So she thinks you need to stop moping around, too, huh?

819
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,502
Something like that.

820
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:36,253
Here's a confession.

821
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:39,840
I'm not a great writer.

822
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:44,095
I'm a great
re-writer.

823
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:46,222
I think about us.

824
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:48,933
Our story and...

825
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:51,102
and all the things that went wrong with us

826
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:54,146
and I-- I could do it so
much better this time.

827
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:00,611
I haven't written anything since you left.

828
00:47:00,695 --> 00:47:02,613
Bill...

829
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:04,699
you've had two books published.

830
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:07,702
Well, they were books that I
started when we were married.

831
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:09,662
I finished them, but I haven't written anything new.

832
00:47:09,745 --> 00:47:11,914
You are a great writer.

833
00:47:11,998 --> 00:47:15,167
Don't waste all your imagination on me.

834
00:47:21,382 --> 00:47:22,425
Which way are you...

835
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:24,427
I'm over here.

836
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:26,512
I'm the other way.

837
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:29,348
It was great running into you.

838
00:47:29,432 --> 00:47:32,018
You, too.

839
00:47:32,101 --> 00:47:33,811
Bill...

840
00:47:37,523 --> 00:47:42,903
I have... I have days when I'm not
sure if I made the right decision.

841
00:47:42,987 --> 00:47:45,197
I have bad days, too.

842
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:50,870
I don't know why I'm saying this.

843
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:53,956
I guess I just don't want you to
think that I don't think about us,

844
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,625
you know, and...

845
00:47:56,709 --> 00:47:58,085
all those years we spent together,

846
00:47:58,169 --> 00:47:59,170
because I do...

847
00:47:59,253 --> 00:48:01,547
think about...

848
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,591
everything that I gave up.

849
00:48:06,302 --> 00:48:08,345
I wonder if it was worth it.

850
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:11,724
Was it?

851
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:20,232
I got to go.
[sighs]

852
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:21,776
Merry Christmas.

853
00:48:24,737 --> 00:48:26,447
Merry Christmas.

854
00:48:29,283 --> 00:48:31,577
It was so nice to meet you.

855
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,996
Oh, you, too, Samantha.

856
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,499
I hope you come back and see me again soon.

857
00:48:36,582 --> 00:48:38,167
I will.
Okay, you two.

858
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,585
I'm going to walk Sam to her car.

859
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:41,670
I'll be right back, Mom.

860
00:48:41,754 --> 00:48:43,839
[caretaker] Not so fast.
I made hot chocolate.

861
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:45,049
It's in the kitchen.

862
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:49,512
What's wrong with your mom?

863
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:55,726
She, um...
She has a brain tumor.

864
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,604
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.

865
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:04,944
I can't believe how much of a bitch I've been to you.

866
00:49:05,027 --> 00:49:06,946
Yeah, I know, right?

867
00:49:07,029 --> 00:49:09,657
Okay, yeah.

868
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:14,578
I don't... I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.

869
00:49:14,662 --> 00:49:18,082
Really, I--

870
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:21,377
I've enjoyed all of our back
and forth, you know, sparring.

871
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,296
It's really... it's helped me
take my mind off of all this.

872
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:28,134
Well, I'm glad I could help out.

873
00:49:29,802 --> 00:49:31,512
You going home for Christmas?

874
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:33,973
Yeah, I'm headed back there tomorrow.

875
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:41,522
Well, I'm willing to forget about
this whole stalking incident,

876
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:44,066
if you will allow me to take you out

877
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,026
on a proper date when you get back.

878
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:47,319
Okay.

879
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:50,406
Really?
That easy? Yeah?

880
00:49:50,489 --> 00:49:52,783
I'm not going to say it again.

881
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:54,451
Okay.

882
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:57,538
Oh, I actually...

883
00:49:57,621 --> 00:50:02,585
brought you an ARC of my new book.

884
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:06,297
Oh, wow. Stalking and a present.

885
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,635
Under the Pink by Samantha Borgens.
Look at that.

886
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:18,350
Well, I will... I will
read this over break.

887
00:50:18,434 --> 00:50:20,394
Probably aloud.

888
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:23,022
My mom and I have been tearing through some books lately.

889
00:50:23,105 --> 00:50:25,232
No, you can't read it to her.

890
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:27,651
It's filled with sex and profanity.

891
00:50:27,735 --> 00:50:29,862
Oh, no, she loves sex.

892
00:50:32,489 --> 00:50:34,617
(Samantha)
You added too much water.

893
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,244
(Bill)
It's not like you're Martha Stewart in here.

894
00:50:37,328 --> 00:50:41,665
Says the guy who puts sprinkles on burn.

895
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,500
Hey, guys.

896
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:44,835
Look at you!

897
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:46,253
Why are you all dressed up?

898
00:50:46,337 --> 00:50:47,838
I'm going over to Kate's.

899
00:50:47,922 --> 00:50:49,506
Why does it smell so horrible in here?

900
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,550
No, no, no. These are our cookies.
Smell.

901
00:50:51,634 --> 00:50:53,427
Yeah, we burned the first batch.

902
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,304
Actually, this is the second.
[fire alarm beeps]

903
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:57,473
No, no, no, no, no!

904
00:50:57,556 --> 00:51:00,434
Sorry!

905
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,519
Oh, my God, Dad!
What?

906
00:51:02,603 --> 00:51:04,063
This is ridiculous!

907
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,689
We burned them again!

908
00:51:05,773 --> 00:51:06,941
Oh, God. Okay...
[laughing]

909
00:51:07,024 --> 00:51:09,235
Yeah, no laughing, Rusty.

910
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:11,362
When am I going to meet this girl?

911
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:13,322
I don't know. Try not
to burn the house down.

912
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:14,365
Yeah, drive careful.

913
00:51:14,448 --> 00:51:15,616
I will.

914
00:51:17,493 --> 00:51:19,495
How serious is this thing?

915
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:21,664
Uh, they're having sex.

916
00:51:21,747 --> 00:51:24,833
What?
How do you know?

917
00:51:24,959 --> 00:51:28,420
Yeah.
Wow, go Rusty!

918
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:30,130
She has more experience than him.

919
00:51:30,214 --> 00:51:32,132
Yeah, well, who doesn't?

920
00:51:32,216 --> 00:51:34,426
He seems really happy.

921
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:37,596
At least someone in this house is.

922
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,474
Do you see a frown on my face?

923
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:43,519
You do seem unusually chipper today.

924
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:45,354
Have you discovered
anti-depressants?

925
00:51:45,437 --> 00:51:49,650
Actually, no. I'm just
moving on with my life.

926
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:51,360
I'm done with the whole thing with your mom,

927
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:53,320
and I'm moving forward.

928
00:51:53,404 --> 00:51:56,031
Seriously?

929
00:51:56,115 --> 00:51:57,950
New Year's resolution.

930
00:51:58,033 --> 00:51:59,868
How about that?
Moving on.

931
00:51:59,952 --> 00:52:01,537
Dad?
Yeah.

932
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,871
That's huge!

933
00:52:02,955 --> 00:52:05,040
That's so...
Oh, flour hug.

934
00:52:05,124 --> 00:52:08,335
No, no, no!

935
00:52:08,419 --> 00:52:09,670
Not on my white shirt.

936
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:11,547
Ta-da!

937
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,549
I thought you already gave me my Christmas present.

938
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:15,718
Shut up and open it.
Come on.

939
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:18,012
All right, here we go.

940
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:21,557
This isn't just a CD.

941
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,058
It isn't?
No.

942
00:52:23,142 --> 00:52:26,020
It's a roadmap to my soul.

943
00:52:27,688 --> 00:52:29,356
It's like if you gave me a favorite book.

944
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,318
Yeah, speaking of that.

945
00:52:32,401 --> 00:52:33,652
Boom.

946
00:52:33,736 --> 00:52:35,404
Oh, my gosh.

947
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:42,828
Wow, this is the biggest book I've ever seen.

948
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:44,371
I know it looks formidable,

949
00:52:44,455 --> 00:52:46,457
but honestly, it's going to be, like,

950
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:49,043
one of the most satisfying reading
experiences of your life.

951
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:50,794
Is it scary?

952
00:52:50,878 --> 00:52:52,755
Yeah, sure, but it's not just a scary book.

953
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:54,506
It's like Moby Dick.
It's about everything.

954
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:56,508
You're going to be so wrapped up in it,

955
00:52:56,592 --> 00:52:58,761
you're going to be crying at
the end of it. You cried.

956
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:00,346
Oh, you'll cry, too, okay?

957
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:01,847
I might have cried.

958
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,895
You're really cute when you get worked up about books.

959
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:15,736
Do I have you worked up about me?

960
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:18,072
Yeah.
Good.

961
00:53:18,155 --> 00:53:21,283
Because I've got to have you right now.

962
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:23,160
What about your parents?
Won't they come in?

963
00:53:23,243 --> 00:53:25,621
They don't come in here.

964
00:53:25,746 --> 00:53:28,040
Are you sure? I'm sure.
Come here.

965
00:53:32,378 --> 00:53:33,796
(Lou)
How was your Christmas?

966
00:53:33,879 --> 00:53:35,464
It was good.

967
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:38,133
Filled with family. You know, loud.
Yeah.

968
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:44,181
So you haven't mentioned my book.

969
00:53:44,264 --> 00:53:47,267
Mm. Yeah, um...

970
00:53:47,351 --> 00:53:48,519
So you didn't like it?

971
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,020
No, no, that's not it.

972
00:53:50,104 --> 00:53:51,355
I liked it a lot.

973
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:53,732
It's incredibly well written.

974
00:53:53,816 --> 00:53:57,653
The characters are vibrant and alive.

975
00:53:57,736 --> 00:53:59,154
But?

976
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:01,198
I mean, I knew you were cynical,

977
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:06,370
but is that really how you feel about love and marriage?

978
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:09,915
I don't know.
Sometimes.

979
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:12,209
Oh, thank you.

980
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:18,090
How much of that really happened?

981
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:20,968
I made most of it up.

982
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:23,011
I didn't draw that much from my parents' divorce,

983
00:54:23,095 --> 00:54:24,888
other than the little girl seeing her mother

984
00:54:24,972 --> 00:54:27,141
having sex with the man on the beach.

985
00:54:27,266 --> 00:54:30,519
Holy shit, that really happened?
Yeah.

986
00:54:30,602 --> 00:54:33,981
I mean, I wasn't a little girl.
I was in high school.

987
00:54:34,064 --> 00:54:37,693
My parents were having a party, and I was up on the roof.

988
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:39,736
It was late, and my mom

989
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,990
came staggering out of the back of the house with Martin.

990
00:54:43,073 --> 00:54:45,742
And she was all over him.

991
00:54:45,826 --> 00:54:47,286
And I remember Martin saying,

992
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:50,038
"What about Bill?
What if Bill sees?"

993
00:54:50,122 --> 00:54:52,708
And my mom replying,

994
00:54:52,791 --> 00:54:55,544
"I don't care."

995
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:57,963
"I don't care."

996
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:05,387
Hey, Lou?
Mm-hmm.

997
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:09,850
You make me feel less cynical.

998
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:14,563
(Samantha) My turn?
My turn. Uh...

999
00:55:14,646 --> 00:55:17,149
Favorite TV show.

1000
00:55:17,232 --> 00:55:19,151
The Wonder Years.
Oh, all right, that's nice.

1001
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:23,071
I'm still in love with Winnie Cooper.

1002
00:55:23,155 --> 00:55:25,991
Okay, favorite song.

1003
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:28,577
Beatles.
"Polythene Pam."

1004
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,997
Great choice.
Thank you. Yours?

1005
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,833
"Between the Bars" by Elliot Smith.

1006
00:55:37,127 --> 00:55:39,338
Play it for me.

1007
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:42,674
I actually do have it here.

1008
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:44,426
You're in luck.

1009
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:48,096
Although this is...
This is really no way to...

1010
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,934
to hear a song.
Just play it.

1011
00:55:52,017 --> 00:55:53,810
Will you at least close your eyes,

1012
00:55:53,894 --> 00:55:55,646
because you got to block out all this other stuff.

1013
00:55:55,729 --> 00:55:58,565
It's really distracting.
Okay. You're funny.

I'm going to trump that though, real quick,

1040
00:57:53,972 --> 00:57:57,768
because you look like a serial killer.

Let's take another one.

Let me show you a test picture.

Let me show you how it's done, okay?

"Oh, I'd love to go on
a date with you. Yeah?

1046
00:58:10,113 --> 00:58:12,032
Did you actually pay for that?

1047
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:14,368
No?
No.

1048
00:58:17,788 --> 00:58:19,414
Can I ask you a serious question?

1049
00:58:19,498 --> 00:58:20,666
Are you color blind?

Fuck, no.

You do not look ready to party.

Let me just take a look.

Are you being serious with this?

1056

We're not in Cancun.

1057

Eh, no.

Yeah.

Why on Earth... you are
endlessly frustrating.

Oh, I would definitely fuck you in this outfit.

Good.

1069

00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,891

Nice to meet you.

Hey, can I help you find something?

01:03:17,462 --> 01:03:21,132
I was looking for some aspirin.
I have a headache.

1078
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:22,801
Oh, should be in there.

1079
01:03:26,596 --> 01:03:27,973
I got it.
Thank you.

William.
Hey.

1081

It's so good to see you again.
How are you?

1082
01:03:49,911 --> 01:03:51,788
Great to see you, too, Leslie.

This is my son, Rusty...
Hi.

And his girlfriend, Kate.
Hello.

1085
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,252
Nice to meet you.

1086
01:03:57,335 --> 01:03:59,212
This was so nice of you to do this for Samantha, really.

1087
01:03:59,295 --> 01:04:00,880
This is great.

1088
01:04:00,964 --> 01:04:03,133
I'd have done the same thing for you

1089
01:04:03,258 --> 01:04:05,677
if you'd published Suit Monkeys
under my watch. Yeah, well...

1090
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,930
I would like you to meet your daughter, Samantha Borgens.

1091
01:04:09,014 --> 01:04:11,433
You might think you've met Samantha before,

1092
01:04:11,516 --> 01:04:15,311
but this Samantha just received a
starred review from Publisher's Weekly.

Thank you so much.

And this is my boyfriend, Lou.
Hi.

Nice to meet you. Very nice
to finally meet you, yeah.

1098
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:29,325
Mr. Murphy is a talented

He's my Patricia Highsmith.

Samantha, can I steal your father for a little bit?

1101
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:35,623
There's so many young writers around here

Come on.
Come on. Come on.

Hey, Sis. Congratulations.
Thank you so much for coming.

It's so nice to finally meet you.

Sam tells me you're a huge Stephen King fan.

1108

I'm like the biggest Stephen King fan in the world.

1109
01:04:51,973 --> 01:04:53,683
I love The Sand.
It's my favorite one.

01:04:55,477 --> 01:04:57,020
What do you mean?

Who doesn't like Stephen King?

1113
01:04:58,521 --> 01:04:59,898
She doesn't like Stephen King.

How old is she?

21.

1121
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:17,123
I wouldn't believe you if you told me she was 18

much less 21.

How old are you?

1124
01:05:19,751 --> 01:05:21,795
This is my party.

1125
01:05:21,878 --> 01:05:24,047
Stop acting like a pussy.
Nobody's going to tell on you.

1126
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:26,841
And I haven't even told you about
the big tip I'm going to leave you.

1127
01:05:26,925 --> 01:05:29,761
As far as I know, you ordered these drinks for yourself.

01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:32,097
I didn't even see her here.

1129
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:35,683
And here's the drinks
you ordered, Miss. Enjoy.

1130
01:05:35,767 --> 01:05:37,393
I will...

1131
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:46,319
Thank you.

1132
01:05:46,402 --> 01:05:48,571
Samantha!

1133
01:05:48,655 --> 01:05:50,490
Oh, sorry...

1134
01:05:50,573 --> 01:05:52,826
Don't worry about it. It's your night.
Go have fun.

1135
01:05:55,662 --> 01:05:58,790
Ladies and gentlemen, could I
have your kind attention, please.

1136
01:05:58,873 --> 01:06:01,376
You may come forward if you wish.

1137
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:05,922
I have been trying to get William Borgens
up here to speak to my class for years.

1138
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:09,592
He's never said no, but he's never said yes, either.

1139
01:06:09,676 --> 01:06:13,638
Tonight, I have him at a certain disadvantage.

1140
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:16,182
My entire class is here, Bill.

1141
01:06:16,266 --> 01:06:18,726
And I insist you come up here and say a few words.

1142
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:22,772
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Borgens.

1143
01:06:28,236 --> 01:06:31,990
Your professor, while a very nice
man, is a sneaky son of a bitch.

1144
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:34,576
[crowd laughs]

1145
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:38,371
The reason Leslie could never get me up
here to talk about the process of writing

1146
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:42,458
is I'm not sure I have much to say
about it that could benefit you.

1147
01:06:42,542 --> 01:06:45,795
I still find it all very mysterious,

1148
01:06:45,879 --> 01:06:48,089
years after I wrote my first book.

1149
01:06:48,173 --> 01:06:50,758
And I'm not sure what it is that compels a person

1150
01:06:50,842 --> 01:06:54,262
to continue to play make believe

1151
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:57,724
even after they're an adult.

1152
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:01,769
My favorite book is a collection
of short stories by Raymond Carver

1153
01:07:01,853 --> 01:07:05,106
called What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.

1154
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:10,695
And in the closing lines of the
title story, Carver says...

1155
01:07:10,778 --> 01:07:14,157
"I could hear my heart beating.

1156
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,869
"I could hear everyone's heart.

1157
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:21,706
"I could hear the human noise we sat there making.

1158
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,711
"Not one of us moved.

1159
01:07:26,794 --> 01:07:29,881
"Not even when
the room went dark."

1160
01:07:29,964 --> 01:07:32,800
And I think that that's what writing is.

1161
01:07:32,884 --> 01:07:35,511
It's listening for that beating heart,

1162
01:07:35,595 --> 01:07:38,264
and when we hear it,

1163
01:07:38,348 --> 01:07:44,145
it's our job to decipher it to the best of our abilities.

1164
01:07:44,229 --> 01:07:46,481
[applause, cheering]

1165
01:07:50,652 --> 01:07:54,447
I'm here because my daughter
Samantha's book is being published

1166
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:56,491
in case you haven't heard.

1167
01:07:56,574 --> 01:07:58,409
This is her success.

1168
01:07:59,494 --> 01:08:01,371
I love you, Dad.

1169
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:03,581
I love you, too.

1170
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:11,881
This seat taken?

1171
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:17,887
Louis invited me.

1172
01:08:17,971 --> 01:08:21,057
Well, that was a calculated risk.

1173
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:22,850
How long you been here?

1174
01:08:22,934 --> 01:08:27,063
Mm, I was waiting in my car for about an hour

1175
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,774
trying to build up the courage to come in.

1176
01:08:31,776 --> 01:08:33,736
So that's what 19 looks like.

1177
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:38,449
She's all grown up now.
No.

1178
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:40,660
She's still just a baby.

1179
01:08:40,743 --> 01:08:42,036
You going to talk to her?

1180
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,746
I don't know.

1181
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:45,915
I'm scared.

1182
01:08:45,999 --> 01:08:50,253
Yeah, she's scary.

1183
01:08:50,336 --> 01:08:51,838
She's all I've done with my life,

1184
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:54,299
and she doesn't want me.

1185
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,179
Hey...

1186
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:05,476
you want some courage?

1187
01:09:07,562 --> 01:09:09,314
Free of charge.

1188
01:09:10,857 --> 01:09:14,068
Yes, please.

1189
01:09:14,152 --> 01:09:16,112
Your favorite book...

1190
01:09:16,195 --> 01:09:19,824
John Cheever's The World of Apples.

1191
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:22,660
I got you that signed first edition.
Yeah.

1192
01:09:30,084 --> 01:09:32,378
That's your favorite book, right?

1193
01:09:34,047 --> 01:09:38,092
Um, well, I really liked it.
Oh, Jesus.

1194
01:09:38,176 --> 01:09:41,012
I even told you what to read.

1195
01:09:41,095 --> 01:09:42,930
Sometimes.

1196
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,685
I'm sorry.

1197
01:09:53,483 --> 01:09:57,653
Anyway, she swiped it from my library.

1198
01:09:57,737 --> 01:09:59,113
She did?

1199
01:09:59,197 --> 01:10:01,282
Yeah.

1200
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:04,911
It could only have been her.

1201
01:10:04,994 --> 01:10:06,704
She thought that it was your favorite book.

1202
01:10:06,788 --> 01:10:10,041
That's what I had told her, and...

1203
01:10:10,124 --> 01:10:14,003
I think she was hoping to find some piece of you in it.

1204
01:10:20,093 --> 01:10:22,345
[whispers]
Go talk to your daughter.

1205
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:46,119
Yeah.

1206
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:51,791
Hi.

1207
01:10:56,129 --> 01:10:57,672
Would you sign this for me?

1208
01:11:00,133 --> 01:11:01,968
Uh, what's your name?

1209
01:11:02,051 --> 01:11:04,637
Sam, I don't want to cause a scene.
Really? I--

1210
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,556
I'm Louis, by the way.

1211
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:08,558
I believe we met over the phone.

1212
01:11:08,683 --> 01:11:10,101
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1213
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:11,185
Nice to meet you, too.

1214
01:11:11,269 --> 01:11:14,730
Yeah.
Name?

1215
01:11:14,814 --> 01:11:17,150
Come on, Sam, don't do this.
It's okay, Louis.

1216
01:11:18,609 --> 01:11:20,194
No name, no problem.

1217
01:11:20,278 --> 01:11:21,696
Guess we'll go with a signature

1218
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:24,449
and no personalized note. Sam.

1219
01:11:24,532 --> 01:11:27,702
I just wanted to tell you that...

1220
01:11:27,785 --> 01:11:29,412
I love you.

1221
01:11:29,495 --> 01:11:32,039
I love you so much.

1222
01:11:32,123 --> 01:11:34,417
[whispers]
I'm so proud of you.

1223
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,711
[coldly]
Thank you.

1224
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:38,337
Hope you enjoy it.

1225
01:11:47,472 --> 01:11:49,557
Kate? Kate?

1226
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,727
No, it's just me.

1227
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:56,189
Mom, I didn't know you were coming.

1228
01:11:56,272 --> 01:11:58,816
You Okay?

1229
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,694
[sniffs] You looking for Kate?

1230
01:12:01,777 --> 01:12:03,488
Yeah, I've been looking everywhere for her.

1231
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:06,199
I can't find her.

1232
01:12:06,282 --> 01:12:07,950
Are you worried?

1233
01:12:08,034 --> 01:12:10,244
[sighs]
Yeah.

1234
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:15,041
I'm going to go check in the house.

1235
01:12:15,124 --> 01:12:17,668
Okay, have you guys seen Kate? I've
been looking for her everywhere.

1236
01:12:17,752 --> 01:12:19,545
I can't find her.
I'm freaking out.

1237
01:12:19,629 --> 01:12:21,339
Yeah, the last time I saw her, we were at the bar.

1238
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:23,174
I got her a champagne, but that was ages ago.

1239
01:12:23,257 --> 01:12:24,842
You what?
You got her champagne?

1240
01:12:24,926 --> 01:12:27,261
She's underage.
It's no big deal.

1241
01:12:27,345 --> 01:12:29,180
No, it is a big deal, okay,

1242
01:12:29,263 --> 01:12:31,098
because she has a history and she has a drug problem,

1243
01:12:31,182 --> 01:12:32,308
so she can't drink.

1244
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:33,518
She has a drug problem?

1245
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:34,810
She had a drug problem.

1246
01:12:36,395 --> 01:12:38,689
Come with me.
She has a drug problem.

1247
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:42,944
Did you give that girl another one?

1248
01:12:43,027 --> 01:12:44,278
What girl?

1249
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,740
She said they were for you.

1250
01:12:47,823 --> 01:12:49,450
Did you see where she went?
Have you seen her?

1251
01:12:49,534 --> 01:12:50,910
I don't know. She
left with some guy.

1252
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:52,870
Jesus.
Calm down.

1253
01:12:52,954 --> 01:12:55,248
I don't want to calm down.
She's 16 and she's fucked up.

1254
01:12:55,331 --> 01:12:56,749
Take it' easy.
We'll find her, okay.

1255
01:12:56,832 --> 01:12:58,251
Did you look at the guy's ID?

1256
01:12:58,334 --> 01:12:59,794
Do you remember his name?

1257
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:02,046
I look at dates, not names.

1258
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:03,798
She left with Gus.

1259
01:13:03,881 --> 01:13:05,424
Who the fuck is Gus?

1260
01:13:05,508 --> 01:13:07,593
(Lou) I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, all right?

1261
01:13:07,677 --> 01:13:09,011
(Samantha)
You had no right.

1262
01:13:09,095 --> 01:13:10,972
I didn't think that your Mom

1263
01:13:11,055 --> 01:13:13,182
wanted to miss the most important night in your life.

1264
01:13:13,266 --> 01:13:14,934
We are not having this conversation right now,

1265
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:16,477
and just stop following me.

1266
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:18,521
Would you just shut up?
Just shut up!

1267
01:13:18,604 --> 01:13:20,231
I'll call you later.
Just please answer.

1268
01:13:20,314 --> 01:13:22,483
Jesus, Dad, this isn't a family vacation.

1269
01:13:22,567 --> 01:13:24,694
Hey, shut up, get in the car.
You're acting like a child.

1270
01:13:24,777 --> 01:13:25,820
(Rusty)
Come on, guys.

1271
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:37,290
It's number 608.

1272
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:40,835
There it is right there.

1273
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:47,008
You guys wait here.

1274
01:13:47,091 --> 01:13:48,342
No, Dad, I'm getting out.

1275
01:13:48,426 --> 01:13:50,094
Samantha, you restrain him.

1276
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:51,677
Don't let him out of the car.
I'm getting out.

1277
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,014
Stay in the car, Rusty.

1278
01:13:53,097 --> 01:13:55,558
Get back in the fucking car!

1279
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:58,227
G. Unit G.

1280
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:11,365
[man]
Who is it?

1281
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:12,908
Is Kate there?

1282
01:14:12,992 --> 01:14:15,202
Who wants to know?

1283
01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:16,829
[loud music]

1284
01:14:16,912 --> 01:14:19,999
She's a minor, asshole.
She's a minor.

1285
01:14:20,082 --> 01:14:21,334
Okay, where is she?
In the bedroom.

1286
01:14:23,961 --> 01:14:25,421

1289
01:14:32,136 --> 01:14:34,430
Help me.
She won't wake up.

1290
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:35,890
Jesus, what did you give her?

1291
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:37,725
She was drunk Fucking liar!

1292
01:14:37,808 --> 01:14:39,810
Oh, fuck! We did a little coke.
That was it.

1293
01:14:39,894 --> 01:14:41,562
She'll be fine.
I got her.

1294
01:14:41,646 --> 01:14:43,648
You're expelled.
She's just passed out.

1295
01:14:43,773 --> 01:14:46,317
You'll be lucky if that's all that happens.
You can't do that.

1296
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:50,905
Is she all right?
Is she okay?

1297
01:14:50,988 --> 01:14:54,283
Get in the car.

1298
01:14:55,743 --> 01:14:57,370
Do you have her parents' number?

1299
01:14:57,453 --> 01:14:58,829
Yeah, where's my phone?

1300
01:14:58,913 --> 01:15:00,748
Okay.
What's going on?

1301

[typing on computer keyboard]

1302
01:16:14,905 --> 01:16:17,116
How's Louis?
Who's Louis?

1303
01:16:28,753 --> 01:16:31,839
Why don't you see if your brother is up yet?

1304
01:16:31,922 --> 01:16:35,259
You don't need to send me
away to talk to Mrs. Wolcott.

1305
01:16:37,178 --> 01:16:40,097
I know you two are sleeping together.

1306
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:42,141
You don't know shit.

1307
01:16:42,224 --> 01:16:44,894
I know you fuck Tricia Wolcott.

1308
01:16:44,977 --> 01:16:49,940
Hey... go wake up
your brother.

1309
01:16:58,073 --> 01:17:01,577
Rusty, wake up.

1310
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,496

[rock music comes to foreground]

1314
01:18:05,683 --> 01:18:10,771
Dear Rusty, I know you probably
never want' to see me again.

1315
01:18:10,855 --> 01:18:12,815
I did a terrible thing to you.

1316
01:18:12,898 --> 01:18:15,401
My Dad fold me you called to see how I was.

1317
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:17,319
As I'm sure he fold you, I'm in rehab.

1318
01:18:17,403 --> 01:18:19,780
My biggest mistake other than hurting you

1319
01:18:19,864 --> 01:18:21,782
was thinking you could fix me.

1320
01:18:21,866 --> 01:18:24,535
Only I can fix me.

1321
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:27,580
I'd like to become a person who actually
deserves to be with someone like you.

1322
01:18:27,663 --> 01:18:31,542
I don't know how long that will fake, but
I hope you're around when if happens.

1323
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:35,921
In the meantime, just know I'm truly
sorry for everything I put you through.

1324
01:18:36,005 --> 01:18:37,923
Love, Kate.

1325
01:18:38,007 --> 01:18:41,051
Oh, P.S. You were
right about that book.

1326
01:18:41,135 --> 01:18:44,388
I cried at the end.
Big time.

1327
01:18:55,357 --> 01:18:59,528
I know it's been a rough couple months...

1328
01:18:59,612 --> 01:19:01,697
but you coming home drunk...

1329
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,824
or stoned...

1330
01:19:03,908 --> 01:19:06,785
every night? Now you've
been in a fight?

1331
01:19:06,911 --> 01:19:10,998
It was payback for something that
happened last fall. I don't care.

1332
01:19:15,252 --> 01:19:18,005
I know it's your first heartbreak.

1333
01:19:18,088 --> 01:19:20,215
I know it hurts.

1334
01:19:20,299 --> 01:19:22,259
Nothing hurts like the first one,

1335
01:19:22,343 --> 01:19:25,888
but you've got to channel this into your work.

1336
01:19:25,971 --> 01:19:27,556
Make something positive out of it.

1337
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,642
Is that what you did when Mom left?

1338
01:19:31,185 --> 01:19:33,020
What?

1339
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:36,315
Is that what you did when Mom left?
You turned it...

1340
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:42,529
You're grounded.

1341
01:19:43,948 --> 01:19:46,158
You kidding me, Dad?

1342
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:48,869
Would you just chill out? You can't ground me.
Yeah, I just did, okay?

1343
01:19:48,953 --> 01:19:50,245
I just did.

1344
01:19:50,329 --> 01:19:51,664
You're the one who told me...

1345
01:19:51,747 --> 01:19:53,707
No journal, nothing.

1346
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:56,126
You're the one who told me to go out and get experiences.

1347
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,796
You can't make me write, Dad.

1348
01:19:58,879 --> 01:20:01,423
I don't have to! You're a writer.
You'll do it yourself.

1349
01:20:13,268 --> 01:20:14,770
When you were little, you used to run down

1350
01:20:14,853 --> 01:20:16,230
to the edge of the water like that

1351
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:18,524
when the tide was pulling out.

1352
01:20:18,607 --> 01:20:20,651
And you would turn around screaming when it came...

1353
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:23,278
I'm letting the ocean get me, Daddy!

1354
01:20:23,362 --> 01:20:26,073
I'm letting the ocean get me!

1355
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:31,078
Your mom used to watch you like a hawk.

1356
01:20:31,161 --> 01:20:34,039
She was terrified that the ocean was going to grab you

1357
01:20:34,123 --> 01:20:36,041
and pull you out to sea.

1358
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,710
Why are we talking about her?

1359
01:20:37,793 --> 01:20:39,545
What are we doing down here?

1360
01:20:39,628 --> 01:20:42,006
Your mom loves you.

1361
01:20:42,089 --> 01:20:43,841
She never did anything to you.

1362
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:46,093
It's pointless. I know
what you're going to say.

1363
01:20:47,845 --> 01:20:49,513
No, you don't.

1364
01:20:49,596 --> 01:20:52,099
Those things she did to me,

1365
01:20:52,182 --> 01:20:54,685
the things you've been holding over her,

1366
01:20:54,768 --> 01:20:57,688
I had already done to her years ago.

1367
01:20:57,771 --> 01:20:59,523
What are you talking about?

1368
01:21:03,152 --> 01:21:04,653
I fell in love with somebody,

1369
01:21:04,737 --> 01:21:06,155
and and got lost, left.

1370
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,073
Bullshit. You were just a baby,

1371
01:21:08,198 --> 01:21:10,159
and your mother waited for me.
Shut up, Dad.

1372
01:21:10,242 --> 01:21:12,411
She waited six months, Samantha.

1373
01:21:12,536 --> 01:21:15,164
And when I realized what a selfish
shit I'd been... Shut up, Dad!

1374
01:21:15,247 --> 01:21:16,915
She took me back.
It's the truth.

1375
01:21:16,999 --> 01:21:19,626
You couldn't tell me, Dad?
Really?

1376
01:21:19,710 --> 01:21:21,920
You just made me hate her!

1377
01:21:22,004 --> 01:21:25,215
She made me promise that if she
did something as stupid as I had

1378
01:21:25,299 --> 01:21:27,426
she hoped I'd have the decency to wait for her,

1379
01:21:27,509 --> 01:21:28,927
so I am.

1380
01:21:29,011 --> 01:21:31,430
I should have told you, Samantha.

1381
01:21:31,513 --> 01:21:32,931
I'm sorry.

1382
01:22:01,627 --> 01:22:03,212
I'm sorry.

1383
01:22:08,717 --> 01:22:11,762
She waited six months, Dad.
You've been waiting three years.

1384
01:22:13,889 --> 01:22:16,016
I think you made good on your promise.

1385
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:19,228
It's okay to stop waiting.

1386
01:22:19,311 --> 01:22:25,734
Yeah... She's
coming back.

1387
01:22:25,818 --> 01:22:28,737
What makes you so sure?

1388
01:22:28,821 --> 01:22:30,864
Because she waited.

1389
01:22:30,948 --> 01:22:34,535
And your mother is a far better person than I'll ever be.

Uh, yes, sir.
I'm here.

I've Just Seen a Face.

01:26:21,136 --> 01:26:24,097
I loved it.
My sister sent it to you?

1411
01:26:24,181 --> 01:26:26,099
Yep, I took the liberty of sending it

1412
01:26:26,183 --> 01:26:28,727
to the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.

1413
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:30,729
They've published some of my stories over the years,

1414
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:33,774
and I though! they might
be a good fit for yours.

1415
01:26:33,857 --> 01:26:35,901
Uh, wow, thank you.
Thank you so much.

I can't believe you actually read my story

and you liked it.
I just...

1433

01:28:42,736 --> 01:28:44,946
They're laughing at your work.

1446
01:28:45,030 --> 01:28:46,448
It's not funny.

1447
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:47,824
It's pretty interesting.

1448
01:28:47,908 --> 01:28:49,868
It's really a short story.

1449
01:28:49,951 --> 01:28:51,495
No, no, it's great.

1450
01:28:51,578 --> 01:28:54,623
It's about a detective with Alzheimer's.

1451
01:28:54,706 --> 01:28:56,416
You're kidding me.
No, I'm not.

1452
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,293
[doorbell]

1453
01:28:58,376 --> 01:29:00,712
I'll get it. I invited Kate.
She might come.

1454
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,965
It should be entertaining.

1455
01:29:09,095 --> 01:29:11,181
Mom?

1456
01:29:11,264 --> 01:29:15,101
Hi... Um.

1457
01:29:17,229 --> 01:29:19,439
I kind of pictured your dad opening the door.

1458
01:29:21,483 --> 01:29:23,527
Could you shut it and go get him?

1459
01:29:47,759 --> 01:29:49,219
Hi.

1460
01:29:50,804 --> 01:29:52,222
Hi.

1461
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,602
What are you doing here?

1462
01:30:00,397 --> 01:30:02,065
I got a little lost.

1463
01:30:04,734 --> 01:30:06,611
I was just...

1464
01:30:06,695 --> 01:30:09,864
I was wondering if there's still a place for me here.

1465
01:30:09,948 --> 01:30:11,658
I completely understand if there isn't,

1466
01:30:11,741 --> 01:30:14,953
because I know that
I really... every...

1467
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:16,538
I really don't deserve it.

1468
01:30:16,621 --> 01:30:18,957
It's okay.
I'm so sorry.

1469
01:30:25,255 --> 01:30:26,506
We got food in here?

1470
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:28,550
You do?
Yeah. Come on in.

1471
01:30:36,433 --> 01:30:37,976
Hi.

1472
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:40,854
Hi.

1473
01:30:43,189 --> 01:30:44,941
Rusty, why don't you make a place for your mom?

1474
01:30:45,025 --> 01:30:47,402
No, I got it.
Thanks.

1475
01:30:47,485 --> 01:30:50,572
I'll move this over.

1476
01:30:50,655 --> 01:30:52,782
Yeah.
Move her?

1477
01:30:52,866 --> 01:30:54,159
No, here.

1478
01:30:58,496 --> 01:31:02,834
Thank you.

1479
01:31:02,917 --> 01:31:04,127
Oh, wine glass.

1480
01:31:13,011 --> 01:31:14,304
Thanks.

1481
01:31:20,435 --> 01:31:21,770
Thanks.

1482
01:31:25,815 --> 01:31:27,359
Good, well...

1483
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:41,539
I sold my first story.

1484
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:46,670
Rusty, that's wonderful.

1485
01:31:47,921 --> 01:31:49,214
That's great.

1486
01:31:49,297 --> 01:31:50,548
Uh, it was actually all Sam.

1487
01:31:50,632 --> 01:31:52,467
You wrote it.

1488
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,219
I just sent it to the only person I could think of

1489
01:31:54,302 --> 01:31:55,720
who would actually like it.

1490
01:32:00,725 --> 01:32:02,394
A toast.

1491
01:32:06,773 --> 01:32:07,565
To Rusty.

1492
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:10,735
[all]
To Rusty.

1493
01:32:10,819 --> 01:32:12,112
And Happy Thanksgiving.

1494
01:32:12,195 --> 01:32:14,239
[all]
Happy Thanksgiving.

1495
01:32:15,365 --> 01:32:17,158
Happy Thanksgiving.

1496
01:32:24,249 --> 01:32:26,376
(Bill)
I could hear my heart beating.

1497
01:32:27,961 --> 01:32:30,046
I could hear everyone's heart.

1498
01:32:32,549 --> 01:32:37,178
I could hear the human noise we sat there making.

1499
01:32:37,262 --> 01:32:39,431
Not one of us moving,

1500
01:32:39,514 --> 01:32:42,892
not even when the room went dark.
