there was a little girl.

1205

What?

1206
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:31,595
A little girl
who was different...

1207
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:34,072
Who was different from the
other people in her village.

1208

I'm not listening!

1209
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:40,911
She could see and do things
that no one could understand,

1210
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,846
and that made
them scared of her.

1211
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:44,475
I don't like this story!

1212
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:48,317
She turned away from everyone,
and became sad and lonely,

1213
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,221
and had no one to turn to!

1214
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,281
Stop it!

1215
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:11,272
But the more she
turned away from people,

1216
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:13,544
the more scared
they were of her,

1217
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,479
and they did
something terrible!

1218
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,182
They became so scared

1219
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,311
that they took her away
and they killed her!

1220
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:21,615
No!

1221
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:24,554
But even though she was dead,
something in her came back.

1222
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:25,683
Stop!

1223
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,751
And this part of her, it wouldn't go away.
Not for 300 years!

there was of the little girl.

Why?

1229
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,751
Because... Because...

1230
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:55,846
Because you want everyone to
hurt just as much as you are.

1231
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:58,983
So, whenever you wake up,
you play this mean game,

1232
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,288
but you don't play fair!

1233

how rotten they were.

but that doesn't
mean you should, too.

that you've forgotten
the good ones.

my mommy

and she told me stories.

They all had
happy endings.

1260
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,813
And then those horrible men
came and took me away,

1261
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,754
and I never
saw her again!

1265

they say and do

1266

I think you
got so scared

1267
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,930
that you forgot
who you are.

1268

But I don't think you're a witch.
Not really.

You don't?

1270
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:41,244
I think you're just a little
kid with a really special gift

who only ever wanted
people to understand her.

1272

So, we're not all
that different at all.

1273
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:51,931
But what about
the people who hurt you?

1274
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:54,695
Don't you ever want
to make them suffer?

1275
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:59,629
Well, yeah, but what
good would that do?

1276
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:02,771
You think just because
there's bad people out there,

1277
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:05,334
that there's no
good ones either?

1278
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,644
I thought the same
thing for a while,

out there for you,

I'm sorry, Aggie.

1283

She's gone.

1284
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:34,437
That story you were telling,
how does it end?

1285
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:38,343
I think that's up to you.

1286
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:50,814
Is this where
they buried me?

good place to sleep.

1288
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,964
Then you can be
with your mom again.

1289
01:21:04,392 --> 01:21:05,598
(SIGHS)

1290
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:24,616
Sleep tight.

1291
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:26,846
Norman?

1292
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:28,819
Norman!

1293
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:30,857
My brave little man!

1294
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:34,086
I thought I was going to lose you.
(KISSING)

1295
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,390
Mom! You're embarrassing me.

1296
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:38,431
That's my job.
COURTNEY: Psst.

1297
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,791
Good job, Norman.

1298
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:43,768
Well done, son.
You did it.

1299
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:58,076
So, are we going
to need statements?

1300
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,517
No!
Ow! That was my fingernail.

1301
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:04,547
You know what it's like. You join a
mob and you say things. (CHUCKLES)

1302
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:07,456
I was merely
inhabiting the role.

1303
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:10,655
Yeah, it was the others.
They pushed me into it.

1304
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,427
Yeah, me and Norman are in
a lot of the same classes.

1305
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,661
We're pretty much
inseparable best buds,

1306
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:18,898
and we do a lot of psychic
investigations together.

1307
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:21,668
We have a blog, actually.
You should check it out.

1308
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,904
So, I was thinking maybe we
could catch a movie sometime.

1309
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:26,411
Nothing scary.

1310
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,675
That sounds great, Kathy.

1311
01:23:28,737 --> 01:23:31,240
You know, you're going
to love my boyfriend.

1312
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:33,843
He's, like,
a total chick-flick nut!

1313
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:43,787
Hey, Neil.

1314
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,490
You did it! You stopped
the witch's curse,

1315
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:49,194
and made the zombies go away and
saved pretty much everything!

1316
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:50,429
I guess.

1317
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,938
I just wanted
to say thanks.

1318
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:55,440
You stood by me,
all the time.

1319
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:58,671
Yeah, of course!
Don't get weird or anything.

1320
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:02,305
So, do you think now everything
is going to turn back to normal?

1321
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:05,045
Well, as normal
as it could be.

1322
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,113
(SCREAMS)
Oh!

1323
01:24:07,175 --> 01:24:08,245
Stop it!

1324
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:09,549

Son.

01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,665
Hi, Dad.

1330
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,030
What are you watching?

1331
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:23,364
A scary movie.

1332
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:24,460
Oh, yeah.

1333
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:26,097
Um...

1334
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:29,569
Your grandma here,
is she?

1335
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,577
Right.
Of course she is.

1336
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,843
Is she, uh... Is she, uh,

1337
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,444
sitting next to me?

1338
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:47,350
Hi, Mom.

1339
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:03,037
BOTH: So,
what's happening now?

1340
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,441
