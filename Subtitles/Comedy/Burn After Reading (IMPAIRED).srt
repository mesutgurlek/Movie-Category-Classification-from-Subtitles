Palmer. What's up?

3
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,497
You know Peck
and Olson.

4
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:50,075
Peck, yes, hiya.
Olson, by reputation.

Isn't he...

Yeah, that's right.
Have a seat.

00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:04,007
Look, Oz,
look.

10

There's no easy
way to say this.

We're taking you off
the Balkans desk.

12

What? Why?

13
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,628
In fact, we're moving you
out of SIGINT entirely.

14
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,897
Just... No discussion?
Just "You're out"?

Well, we're having
the discussion now.

have to be unpleasant.

with all due respect,

18
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,345
what the fuck are
you talking about?

19
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,481
And why is
Olson here?

20
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,883
Ozzie, look...

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,120
What the fuck
is this?

22

I know it's not my work.

This doesn't have
to be unpleasant.

We found something for
you in State. It's a...

Well, it is a lower
clearance level. Yes.

But it's not...
Look, we're not terminating you.

Hmm.

This is an assault.

be fucking honest.

The cheeses?
Were they ready?

The cheeses?

50
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,252
I didn't realize you
could be home so early.

51
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,292
Yeah. I left a message for
you to stop by Arnaud's.

The Magruders and the Pfarrers
are coming this evening.

The Pfarrers...
What did Kathleen say?

54
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,191
What?

55
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,962
When you left
the message?

56
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,294
That she would
give you the message.

Well, I don't know, I guess
we had bigger news today.

My day didn't revolve
around whether...

59
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,066
Do you mean that you
didn't pick up the cheeses?

Well, if I didn't
get the message,

61
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,771
then I didn't pick up
the cheeses.

But, honey, hang on to your hat.

- I have some news to...

and get dressed.

Honey,
we have to talk.

00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:51,217
Well, not now. I mean, they're
gonna be here in less than an hour.

We've seen this.

Yes. This is my fear.

Well, he says

he's trying to pull
himself together but...

165

Just a Tab.

472
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,229
But if I could get
an advance on my salary,

473
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,840
I could at least get
the surgery ball rolling.

474
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,409
Whoa! There's a payroll
company, you know.

475
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,307
They don't just
advance people money.

476
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,243
They just don't do that.

477
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:38,281
I mean, sure, I could say,
"Yes, I authorize it,"

478
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,908
but that's not going to
mean anything to them.

479
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,180
Then why do they have us on
this cockamamie health plan?

480
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,687
I need those surgeries, Ted.

481
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,290
You're a beautiful woman.
You don't...

482
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,882
I have gone just about as far
as I can go with this body.

483
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,121
I think
it's a beautiful...

484
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,457
It's not a phony-baloney
Hollywood body.

485
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,728
That's right, Ted.
I would be laughed out of Hollywood.

486
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:59,030
I have very limited
breasts, a ginormous ass,

487
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,399
and I've got this gut
that swings back and forth

488
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,541
in front of me like a shopping
cart with a bent wheel.

489
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,703
You know, there's a lot of guys
that like you just the way you are.

490
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,405
Yeah. Losers.

491
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,873
I don't know.
I mean, am I a loser? Ted.

492
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,919
You know, I wasn't always
a manager at Hardbodies.

493
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,680
Let me tell you...

494
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,224
Let me show you something.

495
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,623
Is that you?

496
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:35,002
Fourteen years, a Greek Orthodox priest.
Congregation in Chevy Chase.

497
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,075
That's a good job! What happened?
- Mmm-hmm.

498
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,744
It's a long story.

499
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,313
Anyway,

500
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,009
in many ways,
I'm a lot happier now.

501
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,779
My point is...

502
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,756
My point is,
it's a journey.

503
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,793
That's my point.
I don't want to stay where I am.

504
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,794
I want to find someone
to share my journey.

505
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:01,195
Well, you know, sometimes, if you
don't look in your own back yard...

506
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,926
I know. That's why I
started this Internet dating.

507
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,369
Uh-huh. But what I'm saying is
maybe, you know, you don't have to...

508
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,441
Look, Ted, I know that you can't
authorize an advance on my salary,

509
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,477
but you could put in
a request, can't you?

510
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,336
It's not going to
do any good, Linda.

511
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:20,145
Ted, have you ever heard of
the power of positive thinking?

512
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,723
Harry?

513
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,090
It's Monica.

who the guy is.

The guy?

528
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,204
The guy, the secret guy.

529
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,812
So, is he high up?

530
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,248
I don't know
if he's high up.

531
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,083
Probably. I mean,
I got his name, not his rank.

532
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,918
So what's his name?

533
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,352
Osborne Cox.

534
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,061
Never heard of him.

535
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,960
Like you're so plugged into

536
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,055
the intelligence community.

537
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,121
I'm just saying
as a layperson...

538
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,567
I think the quality of the
intelligence dictates how high up he is.

539
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,137
Okay.
Not what we know.

540

541
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,903
Do you have any water?
I gotta hydrate.

542
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,204

(CHUCKLES) What do
you mean sources?

547
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,215
You got like Gatorade or anything
besides, like, Maryland swamp water?

548

Do you know how far
this is from my place?

549
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,121
How do you know
his name?

550
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,020
I got this geek friend,
Eddie Gallegos.

551
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,355
He does computer stuff,
hooks up people's computers

552
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,725
and programs
their VCRs and shit.

553
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:15,391
So he examines the files and pulls off
the digital watermark, which tells you

554
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,865
what computer
it was created on.

555
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,434
Fucking child's play
for Eddie.

556
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,561
Uh-huh.

557
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:20,865

more difficult.

562

00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,810
Why?

564
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,444
'Cause he's gonna wanna know
that his shit is secure.

565
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,251
He's gonna be relieved.

566
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,782
He might even be so relieved
that he gives us a reward.

567
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,987
I would be very fucking
surprised if he did not.

568
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,825
Wow.
- Very surprised.

569
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,195
Like, you know,

anyone think that's worth anything?

He sounds very senior.

I think this is
some senior guy

who has screwed
the pooch, big-time.

651

Yeah, that's why
we got him, you know.

652
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,868
We caught him with his thing
caught in a big, fat wringer.

Yeah.
And us in the driver's seat.

Why do they always
send you to Seattle?

not in a mean way.

That's good, but, Linda, what do
you really know about this guy?

00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:54,487
And you, I take it,
are Mr. Black.

786
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,795
Yes, I am.

787

You have the money?

788
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,271
$50,000.

789
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,776
That's what was agreed
upon, Osborne Cox.

790
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:12,040
All right. Let me explain
something to you, Mr. Black.

791
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,141
You know who I am,
I know who you are.

792
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,481
Perhaps,

793
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,920
but appearances
can be deceptive.

794
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,557
Yeah.

795
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:27,097
What you're engaged in is blackmail.
That is a felony.

796
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,926
That's for starters.

can be deceptive.

798

I am a mere
Good Samaritan who...

799
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:38,208
Secondly, the
unauthorized dissemination

800
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:42,678

your proposed threat,

802

storm of consequences, my friend,

803
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:54,387

would be spinning

804
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,916

Schwinn bicycle back there.

I might be stopping by.

Is there a men's room?

Madam,
you are mistaken.

Yes, we do, Ted.
I'm really sorry.

This is no way...

875
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,848
It was unavoidable, Ted.
It won't happen again.

But you won't tell me
what's going on.

No, we can't.

I know this is
really terrible, Ted,

879
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,191
but I have to go.
I have a date.

880
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:30,556
You're changing, Linda.
It's very sad.

881
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:44,178
Which, to my mind, is all the more
reason to lower the boom on Ozzie.

882
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,812
Mmm-hmm.

883
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,613
Is that it? "Mmm-hmm"?

884
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,614
I'm wondering if it's
the right time and...

885
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:54,122
Well, of course
it's the right time.

886
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,022
Why wouldn't it
be the right time?

887
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,025
Does this threaten you?
- No.

888
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,959
You and me,
we're rock solid.

889
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:03,428
It's just, I think that's
why we can afford to be big.

890

get himself together
a little bit,

the hell out of him.

Is that how you see me? Hammering him?
- Of course not...

No, but that was your word.
- Yeah.

895
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,705
I don't hammer.
- No, of course not. Listen,

I'm no friend of the guy,
you know that.

What is it?

945
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,301
You sit down there,
make yourself comfortable,

946
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:01,172
put your feet in

- Uh-huh!

953

I'm not set up to mold hard rubber.

954
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,037

- Uh-huh.

957
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:35,201
Are you sure?

958
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,406
Hey, the guy was not hard
to follow, as you know.

959
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:43,652
Why the fuck would they go to the Russians?
Why the fuck?

960
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:48,688
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Hal.

961
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,159
Hey. No problemo.

962
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,991
Look, Ozzie, I hate to be
the paranoid old spook,

963
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,967
but those two guys seem
very interested in you.

964
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,805
You haven't gone poofy
on me, have you, Oz?

965
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,779
Can I help you?

966
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,404
I'm sorry
if I was staring,

967
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:14,143
but your face
looks familiar.

968
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,651
It's Princeton? '73?

969
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,778
Yeah.

970
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:19,219
I can't remember
your name.

971

00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,767
Fuck! Fucking...

979
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,441
Why did you tell him
we could get more stuff?

980
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,106
Well, maybe we can.

981

That's all Manolo found.
That was everything.

982
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:24,179
What, are we
gonna tell Manolo

983
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:26,517
to scoop some more secret
spy shit off the locker floor?

984
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:27,681
Hey!
- What?

985
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,282
I don't like the snideness,
nor the negativity.

986
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,124
I'm sorry. I'm just
trying to work this thing.

987
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,027
If I'm gonna reinvent myself,
I need these surgeries,

988
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:36,292
and these surgeries
cost money.

989
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,334
And this is not just
fun and games. I'm sorry.

990
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,198
So let's figure
this thing out, okay?

00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,798
Right, Osborne Cox.

994
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,434
So we can find out
where he lives, right?

995
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,842
I guess.

996
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:52,438
You should change into a suit.
- Why?

997
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:54,210
So you don't stand out
in his neighborhood.

998
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,342
There are certain
elemental things, Chad.

999
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:56,442
His neighborhood?

1000
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,352
Yes. We should take out the
labels and the laundry marks.

1001
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:00,719

The Russians?

1054
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:09,458
Yeah. It was brought in by
a woman named Linda Litzke,

1055
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,667
an associate of a guy
named Harry Pfarrer.

Treasury guy who has
been screwing Mrs. Cox.

they got the files.

it's become complicated.

He just shot somebody
in Ozzie's house.

01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:01,242
I know you.
You're the guy from the gym.

1412
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:04,481
I'm not here
representing Hardbodies.

1413
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:08,078
Yes. I know very well
what you represent.

1414
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:11,219
You represent
the idiocy of today.

1415
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,018
I don't represent
that, either.

1416
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:16,757
Yeah.
You're the guy at the gym

1417
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,890
when I asked about
that moronic woman.

1418
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:21,265
She's not a moron.

1419
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:23,768
You're in league
with that moronic woman.

1420
01:27:23,905 --> 01:27:26,237
You're part of
a league of morons.

1421
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:27,797
No. No.

1422
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,639
Yes. You see,
you're one of the morons

1423
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:33,340
I've been fighting
my whole life,

1424
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:37,507
my whole fucking life.
But guess what.

1425
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:41,452
Today, I win.

1426
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:42,986
(GRUNTS)

1427
01:27:51,532 --> 01:27:52,624
Stop!

1428
01:27:54,235 --> 01:27:55,634
OSBORNE: Intruder!

1429
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:59,864
Stop! Intruder! Stop!

1430
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,736
(SCREAMING)

1431
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:06,012
Wait. Wait a minute.

1432
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,745
Where is the Treasury guy?
- Pfarrer?

1433
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:13,684
Right now?
- Right now.

1434
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:16,822
He is in a detention room
at Washington Dulles.

1435
01:28:16,924 --> 01:28:17,948
Why?

1436
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:20,652
He was trying to board
a flight to Venezuela.

1437
01:28:20,828 --> 01:28:24,286
We had his name on a hot list.
CBP pulled him in.

1438
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:29,170
Don't know why he was
trying to go to Venezuela.

1439
01:28:29,205 --> 01:28:30,296
You don't know.

1440
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:31,531
No, sir.

1441
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,667
We have no extradition
with Venezuela.

1442
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,402
Oh!

1443
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:39,070
So what should
we do with him?

1444
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,205
For fuck's sake, put him on
the next flight to Venezuela.

1445
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,147
Yes, sir. Okay.

1446
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:47,216
Okay. So the gym manager is dead.
- Yes, sir.

1447
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,346
The body is...

1448
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:49,788
That's gone, sir.

1449
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:52,516
Okay.

1450
01:28:53,194 --> 01:28:56,857
But there was a snag.

1451
01:28:57,732 --> 01:28:59,029
What?

1452
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:00,729
Well,

1453
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:06,329
this analyst, Cox,
was attacking the gym guy.

1454
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,699
It was in broad daylight,
on the street.

1455
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:11,176
Our man did not
know what to do.

1456
01:29:11,245 --> 01:29:12,473
Felt he had to step in.

1457
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:14,342
Yes?

1458
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:16,313
He...

1459
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:21,586
He shot the analyst.
He shot Cox.

1460
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:26,559
Good. Great.
Is he dead?

1461
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:28,720
No, sir. He's in a coma.

1462
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:32,324
They don't think he's gonna
make it. They don't think...

1463
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,029
They're pretty sure that
he has no brain function.

1464
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:37,161
(SIGHS)

1465
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:42,208
Okay. Okay. If he wakes up, we'll worry
about it then. Jesus, what a clusterfuck.

1466
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,608
So, that's it then?

1467
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:47,647
No one else really
knows anything. Okay.

1468
01:29:47,749 --> 01:29:48,943
Um...

1469
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,644
Well, sir, there is...

1470
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,277
What?

1471
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,555
What?

1472
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:58,251
There is the woman,
the gym woman,

1473
01:29:58,326 --> 01:29:59,588
Linda Litzke.

1474
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:02,652
Oh! Fuck, yeah.
God! Where is she?

1475
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:04,765
We picked her up.
We have her.

1476
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,095
We have her?
To do what with?

1477
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:13,663
She says she'll play ball
if we pay for some,

1478
01:30:13,808 --> 01:30:17,244
I know this sounds odd,
some surgeries

1479
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:20,439
that she wants,
cosmetic surgery.

1480
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:23,382
She says she'll sit
on everything.

1481
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:25,145
How much?

1482
01:30:25,219 --> 01:30:26,618
There were
several procedures.

1483
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:27,813
Altogether they...
- Pay it.

1484
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:30,084
Yes, sir. Okay. Yeah.

1485

Yeah.

1488
01:30:37,865 --> 01:30:39,696
What do we learn, Palmer?

1489
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:41,132
I don't know, sir.

1490
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:43,764
I don't fucking know, either.

1491
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:47,401
I guess we learn not to do it again.
- Yes, sir.

1492
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:49,602
I'm fucked if
I know what we did.

1493
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:51,905
Yes, sir,
it's hard to say.
