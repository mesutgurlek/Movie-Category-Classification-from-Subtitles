1
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:09,644
And now let's welcome
our hometown hero,

2
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,400
the next governor
of Washington, Al Donnelly!

3
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:15,363
(cheering)

4
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:22,447
Attention, Buckley residents.
Voters of all ages, vote for Al Donnelly.

5
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:26,869
He's the best man for the job.
You can count on Al, that's for sure.

6
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,539
Folks, if you're wondering who to vote
for, Al Donnelly's the man for the job.

7
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:39,504
I have to go home now, little doggies.
Nothing for you in this truck. No food.

8
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:43,424
Dogs, I want you to go home.

9
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:45,344
Get off my bumper!

10
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:49,102
Come on! Jesus!

11
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:52,350
Aaagh!

12
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:53,973
Oh, God!

13
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,814
Oh, my God.

14
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:08,162
What is with you dogs?! D'you think
this truck is in heat or something?

15
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:10,325
Get out of here!

16
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:17,087
If I got the same welcome everywhere
I went that I got here in my home town,

17
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,961
my candidacy would be a lock!

18
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:21,676
(cheering)

19
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:27,721
(barks)

20
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:36,433
With your help, we will make it
all the way to the Capitol!

21
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:44,145
(chanting) Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly!
Al Donnelly! Al Donnelly!

22
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,360
(amplified barking and growling)

23
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:54,331
- Did you do this?
- No, no, no... Did you?

24
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:56,534
(growling)

25
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:13,094
Oh, my God.

26
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:24,401
Oh, my God.

27
00:03:24,528 --> 00:03:26,567
- (woman screams)
- Mother...

28
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,338
Oh, there is a God.

29
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:51,381
Tell me that is not your brother.

30
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:55,139
What the hell is a marquee doin' here?
It's crazy!

31
00:03:59,895 --> 00:04:03,346
Al, I'm so sorry.
Man, I don't know what happened.

32
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,226
Mike, forget it.
Did you think it was a drive-in movie?

33
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:07,348
(both laugh)

34
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:09,694
(blasts horn)

35
00:04:10,029 --> 00:04:15,271
I could get time off from the rec centre.
They said I could, to help you campaign.

36
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:19,614
So I was thinking maybe I could go
on the road with you and help out, or...

37
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:24,830
Mike, I know you're behind me 100%,
but I need some different help from you.

38
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:27,956
Oh, man, whatever you want.
You know that.

39
00:04:28,046 --> 00:04:30,536
- Fighting Donnellys stick together!
- Right!

40
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:34,676
Listen, I got a lot of good people
in my corner. They want what we want.

41
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,888
And we're gonna get there.
It's just gonna take some finesse.

42
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:42,093
I'll do anything.
Just name it and I'll get started.

43
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:46,181
There's a lot to be done right here,
like phone canvassing, stuff like that.

44
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,604
So stay put and I'll get you
the details. All right?

45
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:52,478
- We gonna do it, little brother?
- Yeah!

46
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,068
- Come on. Let's go.
- All the way, Governor.

47
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:09,120
Dock Workers' Union.

48
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,791
Let me make myself clear.
My brother is a priority.

49
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,584
Let's just find someone
in the organisation.

50
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:20,419
Just as long as he or she is reliable
and helps Mike make a contribution.

51
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:25,552
So just find someone and
give them the assignment... now.

52
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,677
<i>(man) Excuse me,  Mr "About to be
Governor Elect" Donnelly.</i>

53
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:34,356
<i>This assignment you describe,
if someone volunteered and did it well, </i>

54
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:38,106
would he or she earn a staff position
in your new administration?

55
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:42,691
- Steve, not now.
- Hey. Uh, yes.

56
00:05:42,782 --> 00:05:45,403
He or she most certainly would.

57
00:05:49,288 --> 00:05:51,365
Then I am your man.

58
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,206
(ringing tone)

59
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:59,042
Hi. This is Mike Donnelly. I work
over here at the recreational centre.

60
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:01,800
To be honest,
I pretty much run the place!

61
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,884
Is this, uh, Pat Giles?

62
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:06,215
Good. Good.

63
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:11,724
Hey, I hope everything's going great in
your fine town of, uh, Avery... Atwood.

64
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:17,311
The reason I'm calling is I wanted to tell
you about the candidacy of Al Donnelly.

65
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:22,356
Al Donnelly's a guy with a dream. His
dream is to be governor of Washington.

66
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:28,814
Hell, every guy's got his dream, am I
right? I had a doozie myself last night!

67
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:33,866
Get this: a cornfed harvest mouse,
a hooker, a nun, a Flemish woman,

68
00:06:34,122 --> 00:06:37,906
whips, chains, whistles,
yo-yos, a circus midget,

69
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:42,128
my grandmother riding by on a bicycle
giving me the finger, and a duck.

70
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:45,712
Now, I don't know... Are you crying?

71
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,623
Oh, my Lord. I am sorry.

72
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:52,134
Honey, please don't. Could you
get your daddy on the phone?

73
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:55,092
- No, don't hang up, please. I...
- (hangs up)

74
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,019
Whoa.

75
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:05,898
All right, I want a 32 belly option
on two, on two. Ready? Break!

76
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,320
Hut one. Hut two.

77
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:14,484
Let's do it!

78
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,453
Oh, hey, little girls.

79
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:29,254
Yeah!

80
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,958
(cheering and whooping)

81
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,459
This sucks! These teams aren't fair.

82
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:39,931
What's wrong, Sullivan? You mad cos
you found out the new kid got an arm?

83
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:43,765
- Suckers, take the walk.
- Screw this. I quit.

84
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:48,306
Fine then. Here's to the winners. Yeah!

85
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,611
Kemp, fake head butt. DeSalvo, fake
head butt. New kid, fake head butt.

86
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,067
Ow! You broke my nose!

87
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:56,526
Oh!

88
00:07:56,616 --> 00:08:01,692
- There's so much blood.
- I swear I did not mean to do it! Please!

89
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:04,076
- Ketchup packet.
- (laughter)

90
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:07,200
Come on, guys. This is weird.
Let's go play some kickball.

91
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,368
Yeah, come on.

92
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:13,835
Forget those guys.

93
00:08:13,923 --> 00:08:16,497
- What's your name?
- Scott Colleary.

94
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:18,252
Colleary.

95
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:21,262
- You got a hell of an arm, Colleary.
- Thanks.

96
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:22,805
Yeah.

97
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,056
- Don't worry about those guys.
- They don't like me too much.

98
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:29,477
- Is your mom picking you up?
- My mom and dad got a divorce.

99
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:32,101
I have to live with my grandma now.

100
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:42,444
Oh, come on. Label your streets
like the rest of the country.

101
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:49,075
Oh! Oh! Buddy, are you OK?

102
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:53,537
I'm not that far from dragging you
out of the car and beating you into dust.

103
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:57,576
You should work up to that.
Kind of leaves you nowhere to go.

104
00:08:58,673 --> 00:09:02,291
I can go to your mama's
and start a small fire in her panties.

105
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:04,711
Now, are you ready
to get out of the car?

106
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:10,008
No, sir. You know what?
That was my fault and I'm really sorry.

107
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,853
Here, I got something for you.
It's a souvenir.

108
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:15,392
Oh, here it is! Yeah!

109
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:17,188
Goodbye!

110
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:25,147
- Oh, shit.
- (honking)

111
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:27,114
I don't believe this.

112
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,488
Damn it. I gotta ditch this guy.

113
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:43,671
Hey!

114
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,634
- That's my grandma. Mrs Oneacre.
- Hi, ma'am.

115
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,052
Bet you made
some nice friends today, huh?

116
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:54,883
(Scott) See ya.

117
00:09:57,812 --> 00:10:01,560
Scott. God gave you
a hell of a throwin' arm,

118
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:03,891
and I'll be damned
if I'll let that go to waste.

119
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:07,650
I want you on the field every day
working on your game. How's that?

120
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:10,145
- Sure.
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.

121
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:30,298
- Hey, Mikey.
- Hey, Robbie.

122
00:10:30,384 --> 00:10:34,049
I spoke to Anderson at the theatre.
He wants me to lock you up.

123
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:37,338
I bet your brother's pissed, huh?

124
00:10:37,432 --> 00:10:40,183
No, he was pretty cool, as usual.

125
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:42,142
I wanna show you something.

126
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:45,562
In fact, I'm gonna be working
with one of his top guys.

127
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:51,813
Whoa! Nitrous oxide boosters!

128
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:55,320
- This thing must haul major ass.
- You could say that.

129
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:04,621
Oh, great.

130
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,582
Damn it.

131
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:11,372
- Get out of my way, buddy.
- Lady, I got somethin' for ya.

132
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,706
- A souvenir for you here.
- Yes?

133
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,711
Never mind. Forget it.

134
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:21,587
What are you doing?
Playing pocket pool there, son?

135
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:25,051
- Excuse me.
- You got a little chubby goin' there.

136
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,719
Dream on, you little fart.

137
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,740
Please don't be Mike Donnelly.

138
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,529
Hi.

139
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:50,454
Hey. I'm Steve Dodds,
one of your brother's advisors.

140
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:54,491
- His top advisor, actually.
- Wow. It's great to meet you.

141
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:57,873
Nice to, um, see you.

142
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,417
Al, your brother, told me
to drop everything, come down here,

143
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,465
get you organised for the final push,
for the election.

144
00:12:04,555 --> 00:12:08,505
Well, let's get to it. Team Donnelly
gonna kick a little Tracy butt.

145
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:10,391
Oh! Aaargh!

146
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:16,018
What I thought is, we'd start with the
supermarket, canvass that area first.

147
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:18,812
- I...
- No, trust me on this. It's a good idea.

148
00:12:19,694 --> 00:12:22,695
- But...
- Listen, I'm running this show.

149
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,820
- I know what I'm doing.
- (moans)

150
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,445
- D'you have to go to the bathroom?
- Please... pop... the hood.

151
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:33,784
- Please!
- Oh, your thumbs. The hood. OK.

152
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:37,623
- What latch? Where d'you want me to...
- Just pop the hood!

153
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:39,870
Please!

154
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,039
Popping the hood.

155
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:47,966
(wails)

156
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:51,673
Good afternoon. We'd like you
to vote Al Donnelly for governor.

157
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:53,841
Yeah, thanks.

158
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,636
- Hi, ma'am.
- (gasps)

159
00:12:57,646 --> 00:13:00,019
Vote for Donnelly.

160
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:01,980
Sorry.

161
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:04,819
I think it's better
if we bring the energy down a tad.

162
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:07,441
Are you kidding me?
These are potential voters.

163
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:10,697
It's showmanship.
You gotta go out and get 'em.

164
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:12,860
Watch and learn.

165
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:16,330
- Hi, folks. Vote for Donnelly!
- Good God, man.

166
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:19,119
- Let me get that for you.
- Look, I drove down here.

167
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:23,585
- I can put the groceries in the trunk.
- Help from the Donnelly campaign.

168
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:25,462
- Back off, buster.
- Oh!

169
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:29,497
- Come on, Mother.
- Let me help you, sir.

170
00:13:29,593 --> 00:13:32,843
- Get in the car, dear.
- All right, Mother.

171
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:43,688
Folks, I'm having a little trouble here.

172
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:46,690
Help! Help, please!

173
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,818
He must be all hopped up
on crack cocaine.

174
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:52,395
Floor it, Harold!

175
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,108
I can't! I can't!

176
00:13:57,202 --> 00:13:59,527
Argh! Help!

177
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:05,865
- Good. I think I've lost him.
- Stop! Please!

178
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,249
Aargh!

179
00:14:08,338 --> 00:14:09,879
Aargh!

180
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:24,802
OK.

181
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:26,971
- Good first day.
- Yeah.

182
00:14:32,234 --> 00:14:36,314
Washington State.
Isn't it a great place to raise a family?

183
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:40,272
That's because for the last eight years
I've worked hard as your governor

184
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:45,076
to make sure our state
is clean, safe and fiscally sound.

185
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:48,746
If re-elected to a third term,
I'll do my best as your governor

186
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:52,878
to make sure that all the hopes and
dreams of Washingtonians come true.

187
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:56,710
- (man) And cut.
- I need a break. I'll be right back.

188
00:14:57,884 --> 00:14:59,959
Did you get the latest polls?

189
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:05,341
Donnelly's brother took a campaign van
on a rampage. He can't get a break!

190
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:09,893
- But they gained another two points.
- We're OK. A lot can be done in a week.

191
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:13,727
If we don't do something soon,
he'll be living here.

192
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,810
Who left this crap in here?

193
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:26,692
Promise me you'll stay in the car.

194
00:15:26,786 --> 00:15:28,944
I promise.

195
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,784
(excited chatter)

196
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:44,876
Whoa! What have we got here?
A tall cool one!

197
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:46,713
Yeah!

198
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,798
Go for it.

199
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,178
- I wanna get wrecked!
- (all laugh)

200
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,971
Oh, yeah, man!

201
00:16:03,403 --> 00:16:08,646
# Smokin', snortin', shootin',
suckin', tokin', poppin', droppin'

202
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,322
Let's do a little dance.

203
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,537
A party with you!

204
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:19,745
- The kid's a star.
- No, he's a gold mine.

205
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:24,750
- (Mike) Ah. Horseshit!
- (glass smashes)

206
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,169
- Front page.
- Jesus, Mike!

207
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:33,258
But it turns out he was giving these
kids a speech about saying no to drugs.

208
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:38,472
- Can the paper print a retraction?
- They'll run it on page 36 in two weeks!

209
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:42,564
Al, you can take this election.

210
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:48,235
But your brother is creating his own
media feeding frenzy-all negative.

211
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,024
We have got to put a lid on him.

212
00:16:51,114 --> 00:16:54,150
You're right.
But he doesn't deserve to be exiled.

213
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:58,987
You just tell Steve to watch him like a
hawk and to keep the reporters at bay.

214
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,740
(cheering)

215
00:17:01,874 --> 00:17:05,658
Welcome, Washington
Teachers' Association!

216
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:07,710
Welcome!

217
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:13,667
Washington has the most
beautiful forests in America.

218
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,505
And I am proud to be
an honorary Clark County lumberjack.

219
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:29,024
- The tree's not falling.
- Yeah, I know.

220
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:34,526
Don't let anyone ever tell you
your job is easy.

221
00:17:40,995 --> 00:17:43,034
Oh, my God!

222
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:48,705
You make the call. The rest
is for damage control. You stay put.

223
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:53,750
Thank you, gentlemen.
Excuse us just a moment.

224
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,507
What happened? It should've
gone down on the first whack.

225
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,503
You covered really well.

226
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:03,550
You're lucky a kid didn't get
his head cracked wide open.

227
00:18:03,641 --> 00:18:04,672
Yes, ma'am.

228
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:08,599
- Did you get the numbers in?
- Oh. Hot off the wire.

229
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:14,566
- Donnelly's levelled off.
- Mm-hm. We're dead even. Look at this.

230
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:17,610
Front page.

231
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:20,814
"Donnelly's brother is like
Roger Clinton, Billy Carter

232
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:24,026
and Ronald Reagan's
entire family rolled into one."

233
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,321
Let's move this out of the land of
mere embarrassment into the realm...

234
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:31,407
of serious effect.

235
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,584
- Ready to play the game?
- I've got some pretty nasty ideas.

236
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:37,421
Good. Act on them.

237
00:18:38,298 --> 00:18:41,298
- I've been fired.
- What? Why?

238
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:46,045
He said the rec centre's state-funded.

239
00:18:46,138 --> 00:18:49,258
He can't afford to be associated
with any kind of a scandal,

240
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,683
especially one
involving kids and drugs.

241
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:58,393
He said he stood up for me, but word
came from the top for me to get out.

242
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:02,439
It's crazy, man.
I don't know what to say.

243
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:05,862
I love this job. I've been here
since the place opened.

244
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:09,776
And then they just...

245
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:17,823
Dude, can I get a couple of minutes
just to clear some of the gear out?

246
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:20,327
Yeah, sure.

247
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,828
Hey, I'm sorry, man. Take your time.

248
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:31,560
(chatter)

249
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:42,194
Hey, fellas. How's it goin'?
Can I help you?

250
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:49,415
Hey, Mike. How's things? Kind of
pissed off about losing your job, huh?

251
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:55,045
- All right, pal. What's goin' on here?
- You shouldn't play with matches.

252
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:58,709
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

253
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:04,431
God!

254
00:21:09,523 --> 00:21:11,182
(Mike shouts)

255
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:15,518
Shit!

256
00:21:16,445 --> 00:21:18,188
Oh, my God!

257
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:25,158
- Why in the hell?! No!
- (siren)

258
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:27,950
Mike, how the hell did this happen?

259
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:40,915
- Robbie, you know I didn't do this.
- Jesus, Mike. Give me some credit.

260
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,927
- Did you see who did it?
- Two guys. I don't know them.

261
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:47,179
They didn't count on me getting here
first. Look, get out of here.

262
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:51,928
When the troopers arrive, I'll tell them
I didn't find anybody here. All right?

263
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,427
- Go ahead. Take off.
- Thanks, Robbie.

264
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,057
- I owe you one, man.
- Call me later.

265
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,693
(distant sirens)

266
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:04,155
Base, this is Mieghem. I'm at the rec
centre. Send fire units and a backup.

267
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,316
I'm the only one down here.

268
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:12,697
- Well, did he do it or not?
- Kovary, I lean toward the negative.

269
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,115
- I know what you're saying.
- Shh.

270
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,126
Give me the phone.
Steve, it's Al. What is going on?

271
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:22,588
- Hey, Al. Well, in my opinion...
- I wanna talk to my brother.

272
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,499
Al, I know how this must look,
but I had nothing to do with that fire.

273
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:30,343
I loved that place. It was my life.
You gotta believe me!

274
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:34,642
I believe you. You were set up. And
we're gonna get to the bottom of this.

275
00:22:34,727 --> 00:22:37,217
We have a game plan. Don't we, Roger?

276
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:42,098
- Tell me what to do and I'll do it.
- Roger and Steve'll work it out.

277
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:45,976
Mike, don't worry.
Everything is gonna be OK, I promise.

278
00:22:46,071 --> 00:22:48,147
Thanks, Al. Thanks.

279
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:52,651
- Steve here.
- Meet me downstairs in the lobby.

280
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,863
Dodds, listen to me very carefully.

281
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:02,658
We have got to keep this... this bozo

282
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:05,457
under wraps until the election is over.

283
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:08,880
Now, I want you to do
exactly as I tell you.

284
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:12,170
- Yeah. OK. Keep talking.
- I know a place way outside town.

285
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,035
All right! Bunk beds!

286
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:47,335
- I got dibs on top.
- OK.

287
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:50,585
(Steve) First class, right?

288
00:23:50,673 --> 00:23:53,377
- What's that black thing?
- What?

289
00:23:58,055 --> 00:24:00,343
I don't know.

290
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:04,389
- Touch it.
- What? You touch it.

291
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,600
- You afraid?
- No, I'll touch it.

292
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:10,932
- You totally didn't touch it.
- Well, then you touch it.

293
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:13,730
- I will if you will.
- All right.

294
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:17,520
- (bat screeches)
- (both) Whoa! Man!

295
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,945
- What is that?
- It's Ozzy Osbourne. Whoa!

296
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:24,278
Oh, my God.

297
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:26,617
Whoa.

298
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:29,743
- I think it's gone.
- I hate those damn things.

299
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,788
- (screeching)
- Oh, man!

300
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:34,338
Agh! Agh!

301
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:38,122
It bit me! I'm gonna get rabies!

302
00:24:38,217 --> 00:24:40,293
I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

303
00:24:46,058 --> 00:24:48,133
Come on! Oh!

304
00:24:51,896 --> 00:24:54,055
I got an idea. OK?

305
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:57,981
I'll open the fridge, you hit the lights.
Bats are attracted to light.

306
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:01,485
He'll fly in the fridge,
I close the door, end of story.

307
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:05,648
- That's moths, you dumb-ass, not bats.
- Oh, yeah, moths.

308
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:08,325
Eegh!

309
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:10,822
Watch this.

310
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:25,250
That's it. Corner it.

311
00:25:29,848 --> 00:25:33,218
- I think I got it.
- No way.

312
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,015
- I think it's in there.
- Well, then look.

313
00:25:37,398 --> 00:25:39,473
You look.

314
00:25:39,566 --> 00:25:42,899
All right. We'll both look together.

315
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:45,939
One, two...

316
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,106
- Three!
- Agh!

317
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,657
You idiot!

318
00:25:50,743 --> 00:25:54,491
You can't catch a bat with a pot, moron.

319
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:57,497
You take a mop and a broom... Oh!

320
00:25:57,791 --> 00:26:01,623
- Oh, God! Oh! Oh! Oh, God!
- (screeches)

321
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:11,507
Get this thing off me!
What the hell are you...

322
00:26:11,596 --> 00:26:13,303
Ow! Ow!

323
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:17,338
Why are you hitting me? Ow!
It's gnawing at my skull.

324
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:19,012
For God's sakes!

325
00:26:19,103 --> 00:26:21,427
Ow! Ow!

326
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:25,685
- Die! Die!
- Please! You're aggravating it!

327
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,987
Why are you kicking me? Ow!

328
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:33,563
- I can't see a damn thing!
- Die!

329
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,196
- Oh, Jesus!
- I think I nailed it!

330
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:39,156
- (screeching)
- I don't believe it. He's still alive.

331
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:42,200
Can we please try my idea?

332
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:47,332
Come on! Hold the thing tight
so it gets in there.

333
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:50,540
- I'm trying.
- Well, try harder. Stay over there.

334
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:55,294
Moron! OK, it's flying in now. It's flying
in now. It's flying right in the middle.

335
00:26:55,387 --> 00:26:58,756
- It touched my hand.
- If this doesn't work I'll sleep in the car.

336
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:01,553
Stay there. OK. OK.
It's right in the middle.

337
00:27:01,642 --> 00:27:04,559
OK, we got it, we got it, we got it...

338
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:06,721
It's outta there.

339
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,351
Good night, Steve.

340
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:15,319
Good night, Mike.

341
00:27:16,406 --> 00:27:20,107
The police officer who arrived
before our guys was a friend of Mike's.

342
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:25,444
He let him go and didn't report seeing
him, so Mike wasn't linked to the fire.

343
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:33,248
Neuschwander, you finished stirring, or
is this a fucking science experiment?!

344
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:38,416
I realise you must stick close together
cos you share a common backbone,

345
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,215
but I wanna see some movement!

346
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:44,181
Now!

347
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:50,093
This is great. There's 1,502
registered voters in Garfield County.

348
00:27:50,188 --> 00:27:52,061
Go get 'em, Al.

349
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:55,812
Hey, pretty good day. No screwups.
Keep up the good work.

350
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,941
I'm gonna go take a squeege.

351
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:10,409
Oh, God!

352
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:11,743
(echoes)

353
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,874
(insufficient signal tone)

354
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:32,262
- (insufficient signal tone)
- (sighs)

355
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:39,731
Eegh! Oh!

356
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:56,157
(insufficient signal tone)

357
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,743
What is wrong?

358
00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:04,913
Oh, something tells me
I want this car to just keep driving.

359
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:09,836
Hey, gang.

360
00:29:12,264 --> 00:29:15,016
Is there an Opie convention in town?

361
00:29:17,394 --> 00:29:20,146
- I'm kidding.
- You're not from around here, huh?

362
00:29:20,898 --> 00:29:25,394
- You know what, I am. Born and raised.
- Nope. Can't be true.

363
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:34,447
Fire!

364
00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:51,627
Thanks for not shoving
the nozzle up my ass first!

365
00:29:51,718 --> 00:29:54,802
<i>(tyres screech,  kids yell)</i>

366
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:03,181
- Vote for Donnelly.
- (echoes)

367
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:08,057
Every vote counts.

368
00:30:08,943 --> 00:30:11,018
Argh!

369
00:30:23,998 --> 00:30:25,658
Oh.

370
00:30:32,381 --> 00:30:34,254
Aaargh!

371
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:36,668
No, no, no, no!

372
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,765
Oh. Oh.

373
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:48,220
Oh, thank you, little roots.

374
00:30:48,521 --> 00:30:50,597
Please stay strong.

375
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:17,704
What in the hell was that all about?

376
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:35,727
You freaks better be careful,
cos next time I don't go down so easy.

377
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:39,226
Next time I'll be, like, "You wanna
spray me? How about this?"

378
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,061
Arm grab! Aie!

379
00:31:41,153 --> 00:31:43,479
Snap kick! Side kick!

380
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:48,272
Rabbit punch!
Rabbit punch, into pile-driver!

381
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:50,860
That's right, my friend. It's a pile-driver.

382
00:31:50,954 --> 00:31:53,575
Oh, who else wants some? You?

383
00:31:53,665 --> 00:31:56,784
Sleeper hold. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

384
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:04,207
Hey, that's my car.

385
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,752
It's that same asshole. Whoo!

386
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:12,336
- (phone rings)
- Oh.

387
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:16,513
(imitates a "ringing" bird call)

388
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,679
What the hell was that?

389
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:30,570
Whoa, what happened to you?
D'you fall in some mud or something?

390
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:33,409
Yeah, I did. And I'm gonna be rich,

391
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:37,028
because I'm the only person on earth
who knows where to find white mud.

392
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:42,826
I didn't say "mud". I said "crud".
D'you fall into some crud or something?

393
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,746
- Get some water to wipe off that crud.
- I'm not a kid that'd believe that.

394
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,676
- Shut up, Steve. Where'd you go?
- To make a call.

395
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:56,346
Remember I told you a guy stole my
car? He's a mile away. He's driving it.

396
00:32:56,432 --> 00:33:01,723
- Well, let's go get it back.
- Uh-uh. This guy is unstable, at best.

397
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:05,181
You can't keep running away
from things. You gotta be tough.

398
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,025
Argh! Argh!

399
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:11,312
Snakes! Oh, no!

400
00:33:11,404 --> 00:33:13,480
One looked at me!

401
00:33:15,074 --> 00:33:19,024
Check your underpants!
I hate those things!

402
00:33:21,205 --> 00:33:24,621
- This gets worse every second.
- I hate snakes!

403
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:31,333
(both scream)

404
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:35,713
Whoa. Check it out.

405
00:33:35,802 --> 00:33:40,013
- Jump in. Wash that crap off.
- There's probably piranha in there.

406
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:43,881
- This place is a nightmare.
- Get tough, nancy boy. Jump in.

407
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:48,763
I don't see you goin' in.

408
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:53,226
Ugh.

409
00:33:55,904 --> 00:33:57,944
Where'd you go?

410
00:33:58,031 --> 00:34:00,818
Hello, Washington!

411
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:03,316
Yeah!

412
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:06,530
Aaaargh!

413
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:41,774
De-de-de, do-do-do! (laughs)

414
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:44,699
This is great. I've never won
three games in a row.

415
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,859
I hardly ever play checkers.

416
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:52,741
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know,
it's kinda easy to win when you, um...

417
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,908
never move your back row!

418
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,203
Ever!

419
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,750
God! Come on!

420
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,831
OK, well, where would you
want me to move this one?

421
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,260
There.

422
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:12,925
King me!

423
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:18,435
OK. Move this one here.
It's safe, I swear. It's safe.

424
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:19,852
(laughs)

425
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:22,479
That wasn't safe at all.
What an idiot.

426
00:35:23,987 --> 00:35:26,691
- Oh, this is fun.
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

427
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:29,106
(bird cries)

428
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:40,990
What's goin' on?

429
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:45,539
That's not normal.

430
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:50,423
(both scream)

431
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:15,607
How the hell did that happen?

432
00:36:18,537 --> 00:36:19,995
Ow.

433
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,120
Oh.

434
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:24,283
Oh, man!

435
00:36:31,883 --> 00:36:35,383
- This place is trashed.
- Check this out.

436
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,720
This whole fridge is held up here
just by this plug.

437
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,640
(Mike screams)

438
00:36:44,645 --> 00:36:47,053
(groans)

439
00:36:52,903 --> 00:36:55,192
You OK?

440
00:36:57,157 --> 00:37:02,661
I'm just dandy! I got a bowl of
chocolate pudding in my underpants!

441
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:06,455
We didn't have
any pudding in there, buddy.

442
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,875
(Mike) This sucks. I can't believe
I forgot to call Scott Colleary.

443
00:37:13,964 --> 00:37:16,502
Good luck getting out.
It's never gonna work.

444
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:19,462
Yes, it will.
All you need to do is get a signal.

445
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:21,629
(insufficient signal tone)

446
00:37:32,606 --> 00:37:34,267
- (ringing tone)
- Hello?

447
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:36,066
- Hello?
- Hello?

448
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:37,397
- Hello?
- Hello?

449
00:37:37,486 --> 00:37:40,190
- Mrs Oneacre? Hello? Mrs Oneacre?
- Yes.

450
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,777
Hello? Are you there?

451
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:48,573
Hello. This is Mrs Oneacre.
Are you there?

452
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,124
Mrs Oneacre, it's Mike Donnelly.
Is Scott there?

453
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:55,248
No.

454
00:37:55,336 --> 00:37:57,958
Oh, jeez. I had to leave town.

455
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:01,380
Could you tell him I'm sorry
and I'll make it up to him?

456
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:04,088
- Yes.
- (moans) Don't forget to tell him that.

457
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:06,253
- Bye.
- Hello?

458
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:31,610
Good night, Steve.

459
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,905
Good night, Mike.

460
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:40,748
(wind howling)

461
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,752
(creaking)

462
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,834
(snores)

463
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:56,515
Ow!

464
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,889
Oh, man.

465
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,598
- Oh, God.
- I don't like this, Mike.

466
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,271
Mike?

467
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:10,936
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

468
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:13,816
(Steve) Whoa!

469
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:20,824
This sucks!

470
00:39:21,958 --> 00:39:24,876
- Good night, Steve.
- Good night, Mike.

471
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:28,622
(thunder rumbling)

472
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:53,520
Hey, Mike. "I got dibs on top bunk"!

473
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:55,273
Shut up.

474
00:39:55,365 --> 00:39:57,653
(laughs derisively)

475
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,067
- Oh, I love it.
- Why don't you shut up?

476
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,034
"Hello, Washington!"

477
00:40:02,496 --> 00:40:05,413
- How's the weather up there, buddy?
- Shut up!

478
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:08,452
(Steve carries on laughing)

479
00:40:08,543 --> 00:40:10,620
Oh, no.

480
00:40:11,672 --> 00:40:12,585
Ow!

481
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:18,666
- (ringing tone)
- Hello?

482
00:40:18,762 --> 00:40:23,055
Hey, Roger? How you doin'?
It's Mike Donnelly. Is Al there?

483
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:25,810
Uh, gee, Mike.
Al's kind of busy right now.

484
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:32,559
Ha, I know. I just wanted to tell him
I'm working my tail off for him up here,

485
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:35,604
and there's no way
Al's gonna lose Gaffield County.

486
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:39,063
That's great. I'll be sure to tell him.
Thanks for ringing up.

487
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:42,739
Come on, let me talk to Al.
It's only gonna take a minute.

488
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,287
Al doesn't wanna speak to you.

489
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:49,621
What do you mean,
Al doesn't wanna speak to me? Why?

490
00:40:49,874 --> 00:40:51,949
Listen very carefully to me, Mike.

491
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:55,044
You know what Al calls you
when you're not around here?

492
00:40:55,463 --> 00:40:59,128
The idiot. OK? All right?
Is that blunt enough for you?

493
00:40:59,216 --> 00:41:01,505
You are not going to speak to him now.

494
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:06,220
And if I had my way, you wouldn't speak
to him after he's elected governor!

495
00:41:06,306 --> 00:41:08,382
(hangs up)

496
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:20,107
Kovary. Man, that guy's a dick.

497
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:23,645
Who is he to say
I can't talk to my own brother?

498
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:25,530
You know?

499
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,901
I ought to go down there
and straighten this thing out.

500
00:41:28,994 --> 00:41:31,069
What do you think, Steve?

501
00:41:31,412 --> 00:41:35,457
Al's speaking at that
Rock The Vote concert in Seattle.

502
00:41:36,042 --> 00:41:37,916
Steve?

503
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:43,455
What do you think if I went down to...

504
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,721
Oh, that's sad.

505
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:33,628
(# rock music playing)

506
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,683
Hey, it's cool. I was in.

507
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,525
Where's the fire?

508
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:53,146
Dude, we pay these bands' salaries
by buying a ticket to this shit.

509
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,315
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

510
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,273
Okey-dokey. Come on.

511
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:02,829
Son, step away from this vector and
get into a different coordinate, pronto.

512
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:05,832
There's no access for you
in this quadrant.

513
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,617
Man, why don't you goose-step on
down to the women and children there

514
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,544
and give them your power trip?
They might be impressed by it, asshole!

515
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,468
- Yeah!
- Young fellow, I'll twist off your head

516
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:20,467
and spike it onto the floors
of a nightmare you can't even imagine!

517
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:23,890
I will dance with you
inside of the six-sided ring of fire,

518
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:28,353
unless you move from this area
far and fast! Now!

519
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,680
(music stops)

520
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,648
Wow!

521
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,479
Man, I liked that move.

522
00:43:37,947 --> 00:43:41,992
Yeah, I learnt it in the '84 Bounce-Off
over at Laguna Beach.

523
00:43:42,076 --> 00:43:46,204
- The one Mr T hosted.
- As a matter of fact it is. The same one.

524
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,375
(chuckles nervously)

525
00:43:57,465 --> 00:43:59,505
Wow!

526
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,715
Whoopsie-daisy.

527
00:44:02,512 --> 00:44:06,841
I was looking for my brother, Al
Donnelly. He's around here somewhere.

528
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:11,842
So you fellas are... performers or...

529
00:44:14,899 --> 00:44:17,899
Oh, no, thanks. I never touch the stuff.

530
00:44:19,111 --> 00:44:22,610
There's enough in the air here
to get everybody high.

531
00:44:22,698 --> 00:44:27,110
Besides, it gives you the munchies.
God knows, I don't need that. Hey!

532
00:44:30,538 --> 00:44:33,029
But, uh...

533
00:44:33,124 --> 00:44:36,539
(emcee) Rock The Vote
presents Mudhoney.

534
00:44:54,144 --> 00:44:57,808
I don't think these kids wanna hear me
talk about bond issues, man.

535
00:44:57,897 --> 00:44:59,557
Al, we are lucky to be here.

536
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:04,606
Just go out, tell the kids to vote,
do an interview with some MTV person

537
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:06,735
and we're outta here.

538
00:45:06,822 --> 00:45:08,197
All right.

539
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,508
# Like stacks and stacks of rats on rafts

540
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,462
# Clutchin' anything we can

541
00:45:31,553 --> 00:45:34,804
# Stacks and stacks of rats on rafts

542
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:38,176
# Weight of the world
crushin' our backs

543
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:40,724
# Tooth for a tooth

544
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:44,345
# Eye for an eye

545
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,517
# You know it's the truth

546
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:52,104
# And this is why

547
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,987
So he says "Rectum?
Damn near killed him!"

548
00:46:04,793 --> 00:46:07,164
I love you guys.

549
00:46:07,253 --> 00:46:09,329
This is fun.

550
00:46:10,424 --> 00:46:14,503
So anyway, what you're saying,

551
00:46:14,594 --> 00:46:18,045
I'm the Man, "Whitey",

552
00:46:18,514 --> 00:46:26,308
and you guys are the victims of
a tyrannical, racist, oppressive society?

553
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:28,305
That's right, man.

554
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:30,766
Man, that sucks!

555
00:46:33,612 --> 00:46:36,529
I'm gonna talk to some people
and straighten this out,

556
00:46:36,614 --> 00:46:39,401
cos this is a bunch of bullcrap!

557
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:42,825
- All right?
- Yeah!

558
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:46,529
- I'm gonna go get 'em.
- Kick ass, Whitey!

559
00:46:52,629 --> 00:46:56,413
- So when do I go on?
- Six, seven minutes. Just relax.

560
00:46:56,508 --> 00:46:59,045
- All right, all right.
- Straighten your tie.

561
00:46:59,135 --> 00:47:02,052
- Should I lose the tie?
- Loosen the tie.

562
00:47:02,138 --> 00:47:04,890
Just take it down. Take it down.

563
00:47:12,857 --> 00:47:15,430
Yeah!

564
00:47:17,486 --> 00:47:19,941
All right!

565
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:21,607
Whoo!

566
00:47:21,697 --> 00:47:24,948
Yeah, man! I love you guys!

567
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:28,201
- Whoa, whoa. Hang on. All right.
- Excellent!

568
00:47:28,288 --> 00:47:31,241
- What's your name?
- Mike Donnelly.

569
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:35,167
Governor Donnelly? Nice threads.

570
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:38,537
- No, you jag, he ain't the governor.
- He's runnin'for governor.

571
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,924
- Well, get on out there!
- No! No! You got the wrong guy.

572
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:45,464
Just a second. Fellas, come on.

573
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:55,512
Uh...

574
00:48:01,818 --> 00:48:03,562
Um...

575
00:48:03,654 --> 00:48:06,524
I'm not supposed to be here. Uh...

576
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:14,532
God. What is this?

577
00:48:17,249 --> 00:48:19,159
l, uh...

578
00:48:19,252 --> 00:48:23,000
I could sure use some cupcakes
or peanut-butter cups about now!

579
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:25,840
- (riotous cheering)
- Yeah!

580
00:48:25,924 --> 00:48:29,838
- You know what that's about!
- (whoops of approval)

581
00:48:29,928 --> 00:48:33,760
So I guess you guys should vote,
you know, because...

582
00:48:33,848 --> 00:48:36,884
voting kicks ass, right? Yeah!

583
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:43,688
And let me tell you, if you're gonna vote,
why not vote for Al Donnelly, right?

584
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,063
(cheering)

585
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:50,771
(synchronised drumrolls)

586
00:48:53,617 --> 00:48:57,199
Cos if voting kicks ass...

587
00:48:57,287 --> 00:48:59,743
What in the hell...

588
00:48:59,832 --> 00:49:01,574
Oh, please, God, I'm dreaming.

589
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:04,205
...you've got some kick-ass shit!

590
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:13,174
Oh, God. I'm a dead man. Oh!

591
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,510
I'm hyperventilating... Oh! Oh!

592
00:49:18,724 --> 00:49:21,215
Cos I was born in the USA.

593
00:49:23,604 --> 00:49:25,762
(shouts of "Yeah!")

594
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:32,526
You gotta fight for your right to vote.

595
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:46,790
That's one small step for man,
one giant...

596
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,909
- I have a dream!
- (cheering)

597
00:49:57,886 --> 00:49:59,878
Power to the people!

598
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:07,056
<i>Burn,  baby,  burn!</i>

599
00:50:07,144 --> 00:50:08,852
Oh, Mike!

600
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,890
Hey, fellas. Yeah.

601
00:50:13,817 --> 00:50:15,690
Kill Whitey!

602
00:50:15,777 --> 00:50:17,651
(stunned silence)

603
00:50:19,197 --> 00:50:21,735
No! No! No!

604
00:50:25,578 --> 00:50:29,576
- What in the hell were you thinking?
- I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk to you.

605
00:50:29,665 --> 00:50:33,912
- Oh, yeah. "Sorry."
- And I don't know how it happened.

606
00:50:34,003 --> 00:50:36,920
- I just got thrown on stage.
- Why couldn't you stay put?

607
00:50:37,005 --> 00:50:40,041
I told you I would
take care of everything.

608
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:42,670
But, no, we get "Kill Whitey"?!

609
00:50:43,678 --> 00:50:48,090
I can't believe I have to ask you this, but
are you trying to screw this up for me?

610
00:50:48,182 --> 00:50:50,470
What is this? Do you want me to lose?

611
00:50:51,268 --> 00:50:58,018
If I really thought you believed that,
I'd just... I'd wanna die.

612
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:05,436
Just stay outta the way.

613
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:07,571
OK?

614
00:51:23,048 --> 00:51:27,176
Are you or are you not
the Black Angel of Death?

615
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,798
Without question.

616
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,723
Don't agree with me.
It just pisses me off more.

617
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:37,177
It's over. It's finished.

618
00:51:38,604 --> 00:51:41,723
Talking about your brother's
election hopes or my career?

619
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:46,735
The person I care about
most in my life... hates me.

620
00:51:48,823 --> 00:51:51,942
I'm not a brother.
I'm an embarrassment.

621
00:52:08,716 --> 00:52:13,211
- So what do you wanna do today?
- I don't care. Whatever you want.

622
00:52:14,596 --> 00:52:17,513
Man, I wish we could watch
your brother's debate on TV.

623
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,304
That's today? We gotta watch it.

624
00:52:20,394 --> 00:52:23,311
How, by hooking a hanger up
to the metal plate in your head?

625
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:27,514
I know a place with a TV. I saw it
when we were putting up posters.

626
00:52:27,692 --> 00:52:29,767
It's not far from here. Let's go.

627
00:52:36,783 --> 00:52:40,911
- Here it is.
- Of course. This had to be the place.

628
00:52:40,996 --> 00:52:45,657
How could you have such horrible
instincts and survive this long?

629
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:50,329
- Looks like nobody's home.
- Yeah, I met this guy. Nobody is home.

630
00:52:51,297 --> 00:52:52,921
Ooh!

631
00:52:53,007 --> 00:52:54,287
Agh!

632
00:52:54,926 --> 00:52:57,001
Run!

633
00:52:57,636 --> 00:53:00,388
(Mike) Come on! Move it! Move it!

634
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,260
This guy's got
a hell of a security system.

635
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:10,271
Ready to start filming, Mr Stone.

636
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:13,017
Really.

637
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:18,316
My God, this guy is like Leatherface,
Chucky and Jan Brady rolled into one.

638
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:21,859
Eegh.

639
00:53:22,451 --> 00:53:25,701
(Mike) "Honourable discharge.
Drake Sabitch."

640
00:53:25,788 --> 00:53:28,159
This must be his dad, Norris Sabitch.

641
00:53:31,252 --> 00:53:33,956
And his Grandpappy Winston.

642
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:40,049
If he'd bought a smaller TV, he could've
afforded a couch with less urine on it.

643
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:42,008
Yeah.

644
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:48,757
<i>I want to see a Washington where
children can walk down streets safely, </i>

645
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:53,643
where people can leave doors unlocked
and their minds are free from fear.

646
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,766
This is one area where I'm in
total agreement with Governor Tracy.

647
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,310
<i>In fact,  I agreed with that statement</i>

648
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:03,938
when she made it in her first campaign
for governor eight years ago.

649
00:54:04,323 --> 00:54:07,573
Man. My bro is knockin'
the snot outta her.

650
00:54:07,868 --> 00:54:12,577
- I'm gonna go take a squeege.
- Watch your step.

651
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:32,015
<i>If you really wanna understand
Mr Donnelly's view on family values, </i>

652
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:35,682
take a look at his brother
and ask yourself this question:

653
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:38,806
"How far does
the acorn fall from the tree?"

654
00:54:38,897 --> 00:54:41,270
Or should I say "nut"?

655
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:43,101
(laughter)

656
00:54:45,404 --> 00:54:49,816
<i>Yes,  my brother has some problems,
but who doesn't?</i>

657
00:54:49,908 --> 00:54:53,692
And I just wanna say
I love my brother Mike.

658
00:54:54,912 --> 00:54:57,154
And I am very proud of him.

659
00:54:57,248 --> 00:55:00,913
And I believe that Mike's problems
are rather modest

660
00:55:01,002 --> 00:55:05,130
when compared to the problems
facing our great state.

661
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:07,586
Those are the problems
I am interested in.

662
00:55:07,674 --> 00:55:10,710
- (applause)
- Get her, Al.

663
00:55:12,137 --> 00:55:15,054
- (peeing)
- Ah. Ooh.

664
00:55:15,765 --> 00:55:19,715
- Agh! Oh!
- You're in the wrong zone, soldier boy.

665
00:55:19,811 --> 00:55:22,764
What the hell are you doin'
in my perimeter?

666
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:25,144
Um, sir, I'm not a soldier.

667
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:29,231
And I don't know if you read in USA
Today last week, but the war is over.

668
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:33,319
You can punch out now,
move on, let it go.

669
00:55:34,366 --> 00:55:36,442
Who told you that?

670
00:55:37,286 --> 00:55:38,779
Charlie.

671
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:42,120
Um, I just talked to Charlie,
and he's not mad at you any more.

672
00:55:42,457 --> 00:55:46,454
So let's call off Operation "One of us
is Crazy" and go our separate ways.

673
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:49,082
- Don't get smart with me!
- Ow.

674
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:51,460
Tell me who sent you on this mission,

675
00:55:51,549 --> 00:55:55,498
or I'm within my legal rights
to dispatch you with extreme prejudice.

676
00:55:55,594 --> 00:55:57,919
(pees and moans)

677
00:55:58,013 --> 00:56:02,224
Sir, honestly, I just came back
to get my rental car and an apology.

678
00:56:02,309 --> 00:56:07,599
And if I could get that, I will gladly
leave your... coordinates here.

679
00:56:11,526 --> 00:56:14,230
- Oh, the car?
- Uh-huh.

680
00:56:15,863 --> 00:56:18,484
- Is that all?
- (chuckles nervously) That's all.

681
00:56:26,248 --> 00:56:28,324
Why didn't you tell me?

682
00:56:29,334 --> 00:56:33,117
- God! Here's the keys.
- Oh, thank you.

683
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:36,666
And here's my apology.

684
00:56:37,925 --> 00:56:39,170
(pees)

685
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:44,055
I can splatter your cortex
or I can explode your heart.

686
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,722
- Which sounds quicker to you?
- (pees) That's a toughie.

687
00:56:49,394 --> 00:56:51,054
Agh!

688
00:57:02,907 --> 00:57:04,780
Whoo! Come on!

689
00:57:08,413 --> 00:57:10,535
Nice moves.

690
00:57:11,707 --> 00:57:13,995
I'm seriously impressed.

691
00:57:14,752 --> 00:57:18,452
- Sergeant Drake Sabitch.
- Mike Donnelly. Nice to meet you.

692
00:57:18,547 --> 00:57:20,918
Nice to meet you.
I wanna show you something.

693
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:23,380
Drake, you ever watch
any Bruce Lee movies?

694
00:57:23,468 --> 00:57:27,548
I got every one of 'em on laser disc.
Well, come in. Come in.

695
00:57:29,974 --> 00:57:32,547
(# "Lady Marmalade" by LaBelle)

696
00:57:38,732 --> 00:57:42,183
That damned debate should've
never happened in the first place.

697
00:57:42,277 --> 00:57:45,977
Donnelly had a smart-ass comment
to make after everything I said.

698
00:57:46,072 --> 00:57:50,200
It doesn't matter. I can't wait to see the
look on his face when he goes down.

699
00:57:50,285 --> 00:57:54,413
With all deference, Governor,
if he goes down.

700
00:57:54,497 --> 00:57:59,242
It's all up to the voter turnout, which
our people think will be very high.

701
00:57:59,335 --> 00:58:01,411
Well, it better be.

702
00:58:01,503 --> 00:58:04,623
Or I'll have your balls
in a jar on my desk.

703
00:58:04,715 --> 00:58:07,171
A very small jar.

704

# Voulez-vous coucher
avec moi ce soir?

705

# Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

706
00:58:22,857 --> 00:58:24,932
Are you getting sleepy?

707
00:58:27,153 --> 00:58:29,228
Good night.

708
00:58:30,823 --> 00:58:34,655
Take home, put in bed.

709
00:58:34,743 --> 00:58:36,486
Good night, dear.

710
00:58:36,578 --> 00:58:41,240
Oh, she's totally legal. I've got
all her papers and I pay all the taxes.

711
00:58:41,332 --> 00:58:43,823
Very good help, but "no speaka".

712
00:58:45,378 --> 00:58:47,037
Who? What does he want?

713
00:58:47,129 --> 00:58:49,537
Not sure, but he says
he thinks you'll like it.

714
00:58:49,632 --> 00:58:51,291
Pardon me.

715
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:56,544
Governor Tracy, this is Mr...

716
00:58:56,847 --> 00:58:58,922
Mr's fine.

717
00:59:02,935 --> 00:59:07,681
So here's what went through my little
head. I got some pictures of your boys

718
00:59:07,773 --> 00:59:11,142
setting the Pierce County
rec hall ablaze.

719
00:59:11,443 --> 00:59:15,571
Or pictures that look like
Mike Donnelly set the fire.

720
00:59:15,656 --> 00:59:18,278
I wait for election day to near.

721
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:23,491
Whoever's trailing... gives good money
for whichever picture does them best.

722
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:26,533
My gut says I'm glad you're trailing.

723
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:29,747
Well, I'll have to see the pictures first.

724
00:59:42,556 --> 00:59:47,383
You'll have to tell me your name, so I'll
know who to make out the cheque to.

725
00:59:47,477 --> 00:59:50,050
My best friends call me "Cash".

- Shut up, Steve.

729
01:00:12,334 --> 01:00:15,003
What could go wrong?
I vote, I go home.

730
01:00:15,086 --> 01:00:17,329
Over there.

731
01:00:17,422 --> 01:00:19,711
- Did I make it?
- Yes.

732
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:23,298
- Name and address.
- Mike Donnelly. 612 Caswell Street.

Agh!

736
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:48,940
- Stop that!
- Oh, my God!

737
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:51,532
- Help!
- Are you crazy?

738
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,953
Get this thing off of me!

739
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:04,081
- Agh!
- (women scream)

740
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:07,462
It's OK. It's OK, ma'am.

741
01:01:07,552 --> 01:01:09,628
l, uh...

742
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:15,425
Here you go. I'm sorry.

743
01:01:15,518 --> 01:01:19,052
Here you go, ma'am.
That is my fault entirely. I'm sorry.

744
01:01:19,146 --> 01:01:20,806
Here you go.

745
01:01:24,609 --> 01:01:28,358
Here you go, ma'am. OK. OK. I'm sorry.

746
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,905
Oh!

747
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:32,527
You stupid jerk! What are you doing?!

748
01:01:52,635 --> 01:01:54,130
Who'd you vote for?

(TV on)

750
01:01:59,267 --> 01:02:02,102
I bet the exit polls
already have us by ten points.

Recreation Centre fire.

755

The arson accusations
came at the worst possible time

756
01:02:19,536 --> 01:02:23,071
for his brother Al Donnelly's drive
to the governor's mansion.

757
01:02:23,165 --> 01:02:26,165
Governor Tracy
is about to claim victory...

758
01:02:26,251 --> 01:02:28,492
It's all my fault.

759
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:31,504
My brother lost his election
because of me.

760

- Oh!

Garfield County.
Tracy: 1,048. Donnelly: 834.

Tracy won Garfield County?

763
01:02:42,891 --> 01:02:45,596
A lot of good our grass-roots
campaign did up there.

764

1,048 to 834?

That's 1,882 votes.

There's only 1,502 voters
up in Garfield County.

767
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:02,993
Somethin' isn't right.

01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:14,876
They were wearing street clothes,
but that is them.

771
01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:19,208
Steve, we gotta call Al now.

772
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,254
Wait a minute. I gotta do somethin' first.

773
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:45,609
Here it is. Voter registration
for Garfield County.

774
01:03:48,452 --> 01:03:52,366
I knew it! Looky here.
Any of these names look familiar?

775
01:03:52,456 --> 01:03:54,614
- You were right.
- Yeah.

776
01:03:54,708 --> 01:03:58,919
Al didn't lose. He got cheated.
And we got proof right here.

777
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:02,586
- We get on the phone, alert the press.
- Screw that.

778
01:04:02,674 --> 01:04:06,885
She embarrassed me in front of a state,
messed up things between me and Al.

779
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:09,840
Now it's gonna be payback time.
Where can I find her?

780
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:13,763
There's a post-election ceremony
at the governor's mansion at 10am.

781
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:20,014
Nothing's gonna stop us now.

784
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:33,361
OK, maybe we could use some help.

785
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,991
We'll meet you there.
We can't do this without you.

786
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,990
You're a true American,
Sergeant Sabitch. I thank you. OK.

787
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:52,801
Robbie, this is the biggest thing I've
ever asked of you. You sure it's cool?

788
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:54,381
No, it's not cool.

789
01:04:54,472 --> 01:04:59,181
And if you get pulled over, I'll say the
car was stolen so I can keep my job.

790
01:04:59,394 --> 01:05:01,469
Oh, and one more thing.

791
01:05:03,272 --> 01:05:06,855
Do not use the tape deck
cos it's been shorting out on me.

792
01:05:08,653 --> 01:05:10,728
Don't forget.

We gotta be there at ten o'clock.

OK, people. Coming through.
Official police business.

I want you to step lively.
Do not make me abuse my power.

(amplified) These guys
think we're real cops!

804
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:28,931
- What the hell was that?
- A chunk in the road or something.

805
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:31,095
I just chunked in my pants.

Oh! Oh!

807
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:04,173
- That bug just smacked the windshield.
- Oh, man. I'll get it. Here.

(burst of siren)

Where is the frickin' thing?

810
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:12,175
They got, like,
levers galore in this thing.

811

There it is.

812
01:07:15,021 --> 01:07:18,472
Man, that was weird. That bug was
comin' at me, we connected eyes.

813
01:07:18,565 --> 01:07:24,982
He was in slow motion going
"I can't stop! Don't wanna... Aiiesh!"

814
01:07:25,071 --> 01:07:27,443
Oh, man, that was wild. It was so weird.

815
01:07:27,531 --> 01:07:31,825
He was comin', just going "My life
is good. I'm alive, alive, alive... dead!"

816
01:07:31,911 --> 01:07:34,034
Oh.

817
01:07:34,122 --> 01:07:36,197
This map is heavy.

It's got all those robes on it.

819

Vroots?

- How come I can't say that word?
- Roads.

822
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:54,631
Row-ads.

823

Row-ads.

824
01:07:56,809 --> 01:07:59,216
That's sort of a weird word, isn't it?

825
01:08:00,312 --> 01:08:02,389
That is a freaky word, man.

826
01:08:04,107 --> 01:08:06,184
Very, very freaky.

827
01:08:13,325 --> 01:08:14,984
I'm stoned.

828
01:08:15,076 --> 01:08:16,868
So are you.

829
01:08:17,454 --> 01:08:19,196
Row-ads!

830
01:08:19,288 --> 01:08:23,416
Damn it! The nitrous oxide's
leaking into the car! Oh, man!

831

Oh, we gotta... we gotta maintain.

832
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,419
I think you just drive the speed limit,
we're gonna be cool.

833
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:33,508
All right. It's cool.
I'll just go the speed limit.

834
01:08:33,594 --> 01:08:35,669
- Limit. Limit.
- Limit.

835
01:08:35,762 --> 01:08:38,134
- That's another freaky word.
- Limit.

- Did you turn the siren on?

837

Dude, I can't even find the glove
compartment in this thing.

838
01:08:49,816 --> 01:08:51,893
Oh, my God.

839
01:08:57,533 --> 01:08:59,525
Man, we're screwed.

840
01:08:59,743 --> 01:09:01,818
Get in the back!

841
01:09:02,829 --> 01:09:04,905

01:09:18,802 --> 01:09:22,634
Transportin' a prisoner.
12th Precinct up in Buckley Town.

845
01:09:22,722 --> 01:09:26,056
My sarge gave me no overtime,
so I'm doing it lickety-split.

846
01:09:26,142 --> 01:09:30,389
Tell me, Officer, do you have any idea
how fast you were going?

847
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:35,394
Well, I got a 426 hemi in her.

848
01:09:35,485 --> 01:09:38,022
Three-quarter cams, nitro boosters.

849
01:09:38,112 --> 01:09:40,401
I can get her up to as good as 155.

850
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:44,736
Never do though, of course, unless
I'm chasing a cute chick in a Ferrari!

851
01:09:49,164 --> 01:09:52,331
I guess I was going about 65, tops.

852
01:09:52,792 --> 01:09:55,580
Seven. Seven miles an hour.

853
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:59,620
And normally when I stop people
they pull onto the shoulder.

854
01:10:02,468 --> 01:10:04,756
I don't know how you
do things in Buckley,

855
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:08,629
but down here we are protective
of the other drivers on the roads.

- Row-ads. Roods.
- Quiet back there!

857
01:10:13,144 --> 01:10:16,229
I've taken enough guff from you
for one day. Raving psycho.

858
01:10:16,315 --> 01:10:19,351
Butchered 400 chickens
and screwed a beagle.

859
01:10:19,442 --> 01:10:23,440
Takin' him back to Nevada,
where he's wanted for bangin' horses.

860
01:10:26,073 --> 01:10:27,782
Good God!

861
01:10:27,867 --> 01:10:31,912
Then you get him through this state
a little faster than seven miles an hour,

Officer...

863

You were great though, man.
That was genius.

867
01:10:58,229 --> 01:11:00,980
I never would've thought of that.
That was hot.

Oh, man. I hope there's
enough juice left in these boosters.

Whoo!

873
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,700

874
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:25,540
Oh, man! Whoo!

875
01:11:52,779 --> 01:11:54,855
We're live at the governor's mansion.

876

Today is a celebration of Governor
Tracy's election to a third term,

877
01:11:59,535 --> 01:12:05,408
with all the campaign staff and their
families gathering for a festive affair.

878
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:10,075
Governor Tracy, having just pulled out
a squeaker, must be all smiles today.

Mike Donnelly is driving down Capitol
Boulevard in a stolen police car.

882

I don't believe this.
Driver, head back to the capital.

883
01:12:27,144 --> 01:12:30,062
- What? You can't do this.
- Do what?

884
01:12:30,148 --> 01:12:32,057
Commit career suicide.

885
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:35,933
I beg you, don't do this. Give me
some time. I can make you a senator.

886
01:12:36,028 --> 01:12:40,737
Jesus. Did it ever occur to you family
may be more important than career?

887
01:12:41,033 --> 01:12:44,484
Ever occur to you that at some point
you'll have to make a choice

888
01:12:44,578 --> 01:12:46,902
between me and your loser brother?

889
01:13:12,437 --> 01:13:15,391
Go and scope it out.
Nobody's gonna recognise you.

890
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:18,186
OK. Promise me you'll stay right here.

891
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:27,064
Thank you. Thank you very much.

892
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:32,236
This election was about
the majesty of democracy,

893
01:13:32,665 --> 01:13:36,448
where the gathered masses
held their vote high.

894
01:13:36,543 --> 01:13:38,202
(applause)

895
01:13:42,298 --> 01:13:46,960
My re-election would not have been
possible without the people in this state

896
01:13:47,053 --> 01:13:49,626
who supported me in this victory.

897
01:13:49,721 --> 01:13:52,972
I must also thank
my wonderful husband Dennis

898
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:56,308
and my two beautiful,
intelligent children...

899
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:59,645
Psst! Steve. I'm in.

900
01:14:01,566 --> 01:14:04,437
Where the hell's Drake?
He's supposed to be here.

901
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:08,608
I'm surprised we can't count on a guy
whose bus is surrounded by mines.

902
01:14:08,698 --> 01:14:10,774
All right. Here's what we do.

903
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:15,654
We dress as caterers, right?

904
01:14:15,746 --> 01:14:19,744
Nobody looks at a caterer's face.
It's always "Whaddaya got in the tray?"

905
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:23,083
Then we sneak around back.
When Tracy starts to...

906
01:14:24,004 --> 01:14:26,791
Something's happening here.
Steve, help.

907
01:14:26,882 --> 01:14:28,127
Steve.

908
01:14:28,216 --> 01:14:30,255
Steve, get back here.

909
01:14:30,343 --> 01:14:33,546
Oh, my God.
The damn thing's caught in my belt.

910
01:14:33,638 --> 01:14:36,389
God! Help, please!

911
01:14:38,434 --> 01:14:40,426

912
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,313
I can't... God!

913
01:14:43,731 --> 01:14:46,138
- You in the band, help.
- Hello.

914
01:14:46,233 --> 01:14:48,107
Help!

915
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,354
God!

916
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,609
- Stay.

917
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:56,189
- How are you?
- Steve! Please!

918
01:14:56,283 --> 01:14:58,822
Somebody! Somebody help me.

919
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:01,367
Somebody help me!

920
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,457
Agh! Help!

921
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:11,713
The voters have spoken, and I have
heard their message loud and clear.

922
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:14,468
- And that message is...
- (Mike) God! Help!

923
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:17,635
- Holy shit!
- (shocked gasps)

924
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,053
(laughs nervously)

925
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,015
Hi, there. Hi.

926
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:29,478
Boy, I feel like a horse's patoot.

927
01:15:31,817 --> 01:15:33,276
l, uh...

928
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,859
Oh, no! For the love of God!

929
01:15:37,948 --> 01:15:40,818
Aaaarrggh!

930
01:15:49,876 --> 01:15:52,710
(groans)

931
01:15:52,795 --> 01:15:55,795
I'm all right. I'm OK.

932
01:15:55,881 --> 01:15:58,455
Gimme a minute.
Gimme a minute. I'll be fine.

933
01:15:59,509 --> 01:16:02,961
Nobody move, or Steve Dodds gets it!

934
01:16:03,054 --> 01:16:04,679
- Who?
- Steve Dodds.

935
01:16:04,764 --> 01:16:07,681
- Who's this guy?
- From the Donnelly campaign.

936
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:10,603
What does it matter?
He's got a gun! You're a cop.

937
01:16:10,687 --> 01:16:14,471
Get over here. I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

938
01:16:14,566 --> 01:16:18,977
- I want that asshole taken out.
- I'll get a sharpshooter on it right away.

939
01:16:19,069 --> 01:16:22,320
- Get your ass up there.
- Ow!

940
01:16:22,406 --> 01:16:27,447
Everybody back up,
or I blow the pipsqueak's head off.

941
01:16:27,535 --> 01:16:29,778
I've got somethin' to say!

942
01:16:29,872 --> 01:16:33,786
Please listen to him. Do what he says.
I have children. Tommy and Sally...

943
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:35,333
- Shut up!
- All right.

944
01:16:35,668 --> 01:16:38,290
You keep your mouth shut, squirt.

945
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:40,953
As soon as you get a clear shot, take it.

946
01:16:41,049 --> 01:16:46,090
(Mike) OK, listen up.
This is serious business.

947
01:16:47,012 --> 01:16:52,053
Now, we've all been screwed
by Governor Tracy.

948
01:16:52,142 --> 01:16:54,549
And now I'm gonna screw her!

949
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:55,889
(shocked gasps)

950
01:16:55,979 --> 01:17:02,064
I mean, I have evidence here you need
to know about now before it's too late.

951
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:05,069
- Mike. Mike, what are you doing here?
- Oh, man.

952
01:17:05,822 --> 01:17:09,191
- Isn't that Steve Dodds?
- Uh, yes, sir.

953
01:17:09,283 --> 01:17:13,281
Al, man, I know what I'm doin'.
I'm gonna prove you won the election.

954
01:17:13,371 --> 01:17:16,620
Mike, put the gun down.
There's other ways to handle this.

955
01:17:16,915 --> 01:17:21,624
No, man! Al, there's no other way!
You gotta believe me.

956
01:17:21,712 --> 01:17:24,831
I believe you.
I just don't want you to get hurt.

957
01:17:25,382 --> 01:17:30,506
Look, I know this looks bad.
Al, man, I'm not a screwup on this one.

958
01:17:30,594 --> 01:17:33,347
I've got proof this time. Real proof.

959
01:17:34,306 --> 01:17:37,343
(Al) But the election's over. It's history.

960
01:17:37,435 --> 01:17:40,008
Like you're gonna be
if you don't put that gun down.

961
01:17:40,104 --> 01:17:42,594
Al, please!

962
01:17:43,482 --> 01:17:47,396
If you love me like a brother,
you gotta back me up on this.

963
01:17:47,485 --> 01:17:51,234
All right, Mike. I'll back you up.
What do you want me to do?

964
01:17:51,322 --> 01:17:53,564
Just let me explain what happened.

965
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:57,067
- Oh!
- (crowd scream)

966
01:17:57,661 --> 01:18:01,789
That's it. Game over.
I'm not even getting paid for this.

967
01:18:02,082 --> 01:18:05,498
- This is not worth it.
- Look out. Look out. Look out.

968
01:18:05,585 --> 01:18:07,459
OK.

969
01:18:08,297 --> 01:18:10,372
(crowd scream)

970
01:18:10,715 --> 01:18:15,176
Mr Thunder-maker here is gonna start
barkin' fire if you don't stop moving

971
01:18:15,261 --> 01:18:17,930
and listen to what
this young man has to say.

972
01:18:18,598 --> 01:18:20,591
Go ahead, Mike. Clear.

973
01:18:20,933 --> 01:18:25,725
Thank you, sir. You've just met Drake
Sabitch, a great American soldier.

974
01:18:25,813 --> 01:18:29,228
I'd like to tell you about
some other great American soldiers.

975
01:18:29,316 --> 01:18:31,854
Drake Sabitch's grandfather,
Winston Sabitch,

976
01:18:31,944 --> 01:18:35,028
whose name you'll find
at the top of this list.

977
01:18:35,113 --> 01:18:40,190
It says that he registered
and voted for Governor Tracy.

978
01:18:40,285 --> 01:18:43,535
- We're proud to have him as a voter.
- Hold your tongue, wench.

979
01:18:43,621 --> 01:18:47,868
The fact is Winston Sabitch was killed
in the Argonne Forest in 1918.

980
01:18:47,959 --> 01:18:52,288
A zeppelin landed on his head,
smashing his head clean out of his ass.

981
01:18:52,379 --> 01:18:55,464
That's my granddad. Rest in pieces, sir.

982
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,465
Norris Sabitch met his maker
in Iwo Jima, 1944.

983
01:19:00,887 --> 01:19:05,596
Nelson Sabitch was killed
near the 38th Parallel in Korea.

984
01:19:05,683 --> 01:19:10,678
But yesterday these men managed
to cast their vote for Evelyn Tracy.

985
01:19:10,772 --> 01:19:13,262
(disapproving murmurs)

986
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:15,931
You heard it here, folks. Voter fraud.

987
01:19:20,196 --> 01:19:24,194
Half these people are buried in the
Garfield cemetery. That's one county.

988
01:19:24,284 --> 01:19:28,992
- It's probably the same statewide.
- Hold on just a minute, young fellow.

989
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:33,160
There's a perfectly good explanation
for all of this. Neuschwander.

990
01:19:34,127 --> 01:19:39,962
Actually, there is a perfectly
good explanation for this.

991
01:19:40,466 --> 01:19:43,467
- She put us up to it.
- Would you shut up?!

992
01:19:43,553 --> 01:19:45,426
- It's all her.
- Shut up!

993
01:19:49,015 --> 01:19:52,349
Ladies and gentlemen,
this young man is a fine patriot.

994
01:19:52,435 --> 01:19:55,105
He deserves to be hoisted up
on our shoulders.

995
01:19:55,188 --> 01:19:57,857
- Sergeant, please. This isn't necessary.
- Come on.

996
01:19:57,941 --> 01:20:00,396
- Oh, you're a large American.
- Argh!

997
01:20:02,779 --> 01:20:04,687
Get off of me.

998
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:09,488
My foot's caught a little bit.
I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.

999
01:20:09,576 --> 01:20:13,788
- I'm asking you to get off me!
- Governor... I should say ex-governor!

1000
01:20:13,872 --> 01:20:16,789
I'm just trying to get
a little leverage on my foot.

1001
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:18,749
Agh!

1002
01:20:21,337 --> 01:20:25,086
- No, no, no! Please, somebody help me!
- Oh, man.

1003
01:20:25,174 --> 01:20:27,250
(grunting)

1004
01:20:29,261 --> 01:20:33,639
- OK. Hi, how are ya?
- Somebody get him off of me!

1005
01:20:34,433 --> 01:20:36,390
For God's sakes.

1006
01:20:36,476 --> 01:20:38,434
(grunting continues)

1007
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,438
Shut up! Shut up!

1008
01:20:47,069 --> 01:20:52,408
Thanks, bro. At times in the campaign
I lost sight of what really mattered.

1009
01:20:52,491 --> 01:20:56,074
- I never should have doubted you.
- Oh, thanks, man. It's cool.

1010
01:20:56,161 --> 01:20:58,616
Are you sure
you don't want a job on my staff?

1011
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:03,709
You know what, Al? I don't think
I'm really cut out for politics.

1012
01:21:03,793 --> 01:21:06,545
Besides, I gotta rebuild that rec centre.

1013
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:09,631
- The kids really love the place, so...
- Yeah, I know.

1014
01:21:09,716 --> 01:21:13,666
Hey, I got somebody you gotta meet.
Scott, come here a second.

1015
01:21:16,347 --> 01:21:19,881
Check this kid out. He's got an arm
like you used to have. Hey, Scott.

1016
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:23,225
Hey. Mr Governor,
can I please have your autograph?

1017
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:26,016
Why not? Governor elect.

1018
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:28,188
Get it right, moron.

1019
01:21:29,777 --> 01:21:31,318
- There you go.
- Wow.

1020
01:21:31,403 --> 01:21:34,486
Check this out.
Gimme a toss, Scott. Hey, buddy.

1021
01:21:34,572 --> 01:21:36,446
Ooh!

1022
01:21:36,533 --> 01:21:40,233
Nice toss, Scott.
Oh, man, the kid's got a cannon.

1023
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:42,534
- Go long.
- OK.

1024
01:21:43,414 --> 01:21:45,407
- Ow!
- Oh!

1025
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,990
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- You OK?

1026
01:21:54,382 --> 01:21:57,170
- So long, little brother.
- OK. See you, Al.

1027
01:22:00,138 --> 01:22:04,301
- So this is it, huh, Steve?
- I guess I'm gonna miss you.

1028
01:22:04,392 --> 01:22:08,140
I'm not gonna miss a 9mm to my head,
but... What were you thinking?

1029
01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:10,517
I don't know.

1030
01:22:14,735 --> 01:22:18,150
All right, you guys.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

1031
01:22:23,535 --> 01:22:26,785
Oh, my God! No! No!

1032
01:22:26,871 --> 01:22:28,994
Please don't take off (do that)!

1033
01:22:29,081 --> 01:22:30,908
Please!

1034
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,800
Al! Al! No! No!
