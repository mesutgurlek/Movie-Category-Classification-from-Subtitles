00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,352
Seth:                           
Oh, fuck me.                    

113
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,487
                Evan:           
          Look at those nipples.

114
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,189
They're like little baby toes.  

115
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,891
Evan:                           
It's just not fair that         
they get to flaunt that stuff,  

116
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,160
        When I have to hide     
        every erection I get.   

117
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,295
                    You know    
                      what I do?

118
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,063
              I flip my boner up
              into my waistband.

119
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,265
                It hides it,    
        and it feels awesome.   

120
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,868
            I almost blew a load
            into my bellybutton.

121
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,937
        I mean, just imagine    
    if girls weren't weirded out

122
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,005
        By our boners and stuff,

123
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,506
             And just, like,    
        wanted to see them.     

124
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,974
            I mean, you know,   
                that's the world

125
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,210
        I one day wanna live in.

126
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,078
          You know, it's been   
    two years since i've seen   

127
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,546
            An actual human     
            female nipple.      

128
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,749
            Shauna?             
 Shauna was two years ago now?  

129
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,950
                        Seth:   
                        Yeah.   

130
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,552
          Yeah, I guess so.     
      But she was insanely hot. 

131
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,988
Exactly. She was                
too hot, okay?                  

132
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,989
That's what sucks.              

133
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,190
              How can that      
             possibly suck?     

134
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,558
             I'd be psyched     
        if I got with her.      

135
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,093
            You got, like,      
         two dozen handjobs.    

136
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,629
And three-quarters of a blowjob,
    but who's counting, evan?   

137
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,798
         Look, it was the peak  
    of my ass-getting career,   

138
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,100
            And it happened way,
            way too early.      

139
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,535
You're like orson welles.       

140
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,270
                 Exactly!       
          If I had paced myself,

141
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,905
                I'd be having   
             at least steady sex

142
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,373
        With a decent-looking   
                girl.           

143
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,543
  I honestly see now why orson  
welles ate his fat ass to death.

144
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,712
Well, you'll have sex           
in college. Everyone does.      

145
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,280
        Yes, but the point is   
             to be good at sex  

146
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,882
             By the time you get
                 to college.    

147
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,918
  You don't want girls thinking 
 you suck dick at fucking pussy.

148
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,054
I still think you have          
a chance with jules, man.       

149
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,222
And-- and she got incredibly hot
over last summer,               

150
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,058
And she obviously               
hasn't realized it yet,         

151
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,959
'cause she's still              
always talking to you           

152
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,094
And flirting with you.          

153
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,395
    Are you out of your mind?   

154
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,397
        Look at jules' dating   
            record, okay?       

155
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,499
        She dated dan remick,   
     who's had a six-pack since,

156
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,001
        Like, kindergarten.     

157
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,437
     Jason stone, who looks like
         fucking zack morris.   

158
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:12,671
            And matt muir.      

159
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,107
              Matt muir, he's   
          the sweetest guy ever.

160
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,209
          Have you ever stared  
             into his eyes?     

161
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,144
      It was like the first time
         I heard the beatles.   

162
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,148
        Why would she end       
 her high-school career with me?

163
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:25,317
Becca dated eric rosecrantz     
for, like, two years.           

164
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,919
            Yeah, but that guy's
              a fucking idiot.  

165
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,987
    You're actually a step up   
          from that dick-load.  

166
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,256
That's why you need to stop--   
     will you get this for me?  

167
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,726
     That's why you need to stop
     being a pussy and nail her.

168
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,928
    You could bang her for      
    two months before you leave.

169
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,396
         And i'm not gonna dance
                around it,      

170
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,731
                 She looks like 
                 a good fucker. 

171
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,100
All right, i'm tired of you     
talking about her like that.    

172
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,102
    What, you can talk about her
         all day, every day,    

173
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:45,104
 And the second I say one thing,
         it's blasphemy?        

174
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,006
Yeah, well, I don't             
constantly insult her.          

175
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,640
I'm not trying to insult her.   

176
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,276
I'm just saying that she looks  
like a good fucker, okay?       

177
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,845
She looks like                  
she could take a dick.          

178
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,514
Some women pride themselves     
on their dick-taking abilities. 

179
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,882
          Dick-taking abilities?

180
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,151
Do you think that's a good thing
    to say about someone?       

181
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,286
The fucked-up thing is,         
I actually do, okay?            

182
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,855
If some woman tried             
to compliment me                

183
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,823
    On my dick-giving abilities,
        i'd be psyched.         

184
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,525

00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,568

                  I bitched out?

209
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:11,323
     If I equals the square root

210
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,761
        Then I squared equals

                        Okay?   

212
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,231
In other words, if you consider 
I as a constant,                

213
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,500
You can then define             
the square roots

  Of all the negative numbers.

              for your pen.     

223
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,163
No problem. No, no, don't worry.
No worries. You just keep it.   

224
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,265
It'll be yours. You won't       
have to borrow one again        

225
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,967
'cause you'll have that one.    

226
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,035
              Thank you so much.

227
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,369
    You're welcome.             
                    That's...   

228
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,071
Don't worry about it.           

229
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,939
         So I was gonna ask you,

230
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,442
    Did you hear about          
jesse's grad party next weekend?

231
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,476
              It should be fun. 

232
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,413
I heard. I, uh--                
it's a maybe...                 

233
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,048
                         Really?
...For me at the moment.        

234
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,349
Um, my r.S.V.P.--               
                Just a maybe?   

235
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,617
So far.                         

236
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,619
There's so much other fun shit  

237
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,220
That's gonna be                 
happening that night            

238
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,222
That I can't really commit      
and, you know,                  

239
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,824
Hurt someone's feelings.        
                    Fun shit?   

240
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,360
         But I-- I never see you
         at parties or anything.

241
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:25,064
That's because of all the other 
fun shit i'm off doing.         

242
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,932
I'd love to be                  
at all of them, but...          

243
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,001
        So why weren't you      
    at dimitri's on Saturday?   

244
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,570
There was so many things going  
on. I couldn't find a minute... 

245
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,672
                What did you do?
...To make an appearance there. 

246
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,208
Um, Saturday was actually       
a crazy night for me.           

247
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,311
                 <i>Aaah... Agh!</i>   

248
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,613
             Evan:              
 <i>I had some friends over,</i>       
 <i>and we had a few drinks.</i>       

249
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,415
                     All:       
              <i>That's vag-tastic!</i>

250
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,783
             Evan:              
   <i>I hung out in my basement,</i>   

251
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,652
         <i>The chill zone,</i>        
   <i>that's where we chill-lax.</i>   

252
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,620
 <i>Like "relax" and "chill"</i>       
          <i>all at once.</i>          

253
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,356
      Aw!                       
                     Oh!        

254
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,024
      Seth's parents            
  were throwing a party.        

255
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,492
  <i>We got to hang around adults,</i> 

256
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,260
     <i>Which was a nice change</i>    
       <i>of pace, you know.</i>       

257
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,696
       <i>You-- you converse,</i>      
       <i>you talk to people,</i>      

258
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,264
          <i>And they have</i>         
      <i>interesting stories.</i>      

259
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,566
  <i>I talked to a man who claimed</i> 

260
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,668
  <i>He had climbed five mountains</i> 
          <i>in his life.</i>          

261
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,269
                     Wow.       
And then we went to a nightclub,

262
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,270
Which was incredible.           

263
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,338
  This big, fancy one.          

264
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,740
      Gonna look at tits        
          right now!            

265
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,308
       <i>"i'm feeling crazy."</i>     
           <i>I said that.</i>         

266
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,276
    Becca: <i>You got in?</i>          
     Evan: <i>We got right in.</i>     

267
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,611
Wanna do this,                  
'roid monkey?                   

268
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,846
                     Fuck you!  

269
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,014
   <i>Then we called it a night.</i>   

270
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,515
     <i>We were all just</i>           
     <i>really exhausted.</i>          

271
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:19,518
                             Oh!
        What the fuck?!         

272
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,552
You would've loved it.          

273
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,388
It was an incredible,           
unbelievable night.             

274
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,490
                That sounds like
                  a lot of fun. 

275
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:27,559
  You know, I-- i'd love to go  
do something like that sometime.

276
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,428
Oh, who wouldn't?               
I mean, it was like...          

277
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,232
Me and seth are always          
kind of cooking up these fun,   

278
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,501
Sort of, little,                
you know, events.               

279
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:37,369
          So I guess you guys   
    are really gonna go crazy   

280
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,570
             Next year together.

281
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,838
Um, we were going to,           

282
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,473
But we got into                 
different schools.              

283
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,742
             Really? That sucks.

284
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,078
Yeah, I mean, it's not too bad. 

285
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,212
I mean, it should be okay.      

286
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,847
I'm not too worried             
about it, really.               

287
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,050
Don't worry about it.           
I'm not worried at all.         

288
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,586
             All right, well,   
          thank you for the pen.

289
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,889
Yeah. No problem.               

290
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,457
      Bye.                      

291
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,958
                Bye.            

292
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,427
             Bye, evan.         

293
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,632
[speaking indistinctly]         

294
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,138
Mrs. Hayworth,                  
I joined this class             

295
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,074
Because i'd be cooking          
with a partner.                 

296
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,642
But she's never here,           
and I don't get                 

297
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,577
Twice the grades                
for doing all the work.         

298
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,846
                I didn't invent 
              odd numbers, seth.

299
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:24,016
I know, but look at evan, okay? 
Just look at him.               

300
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,718
Hey, don't keep me              
waiting much longer.            

301
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,219
I'm getting                     
impatient up here.              

302
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,221
Heh. You know what              
i'm talking about.              

303
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,756
                 Miroki, you're 
                embarrassing me.

304
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,791
I'm over here in my unit,       
isolated and alone,             

305
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,295
Eating my terrible-tasting food,
and I gotta look over at that.  

306
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,664
Looks like the most fun i've    
ever seen in my entire life.    

307
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,399
And it's b.S.                   
Excuse my language.             

308
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,900
I'm just saying                 
that I wash and dry.            

309
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,035
I'm like a single mother.       

310
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,204
Look, we all know home ec       
is a joke, no offense.          

311
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,606
It's just, like, everyone takes 
this class to get an a.         

312
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,874
It's bullshit,                  
and i'm sorry.                  

313
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,676
And i'm not putting down        
your profession,                

314
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,977
But it's just                   
the way I feel.                 

315
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:53,545
I don't wanna sit here          
all by myself                   

316
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,247
Cooking this shitty food--      
no offense.                     

317
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,684
And I just think that I don't   
ever need to cook tiramisu.     

318
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,352
When am I gonna need            
to cook tiramisu?               

319
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,954
Am I gonna be a chef? No.       

320
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,522
There's three weeks             
left in school.                 

321
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,290
Give me a fucking break.        

322
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,925
I'm sorry for cursing.          

323
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,163
    All right, jules' partner   
        isn't here today either.

324
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,831
            Pair up with her.   
              Station four.     

325
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,133
Jules?                          

326
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,303
All right. I'll--               
i'll give it another shot.      

327
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,972
I'll give home ec               
another shot.                   

328
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,582
          Hey, jules.           

329
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,917
         Your partner           
      didn't come today?        

330
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,720
            That's kind of      
            a personal question.

331
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,121
    What?                       
                  Nothing.      

332
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,322
                It's my attempt 
                at humor.       

333
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,691
                I was just--    
                 [laughs]       

334
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:39,992
  Oh, like cumming.             

335
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,927
                        [laughs]
like "cumming" cumming.         

336
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,861
      Ahh.                      

337
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,331
          Wow. That was a little
        too far right there.    

338
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,533
                    The gesture.
    [whines]                    

339
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,501
     Yeah. That's               
      pretty far.               
                         Yes.   

340
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,502
Shit. I do that--               

341
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:51,704
                No, don't worry.

342
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:53,505
         I'm-- i'm actually, uh,
            used to it.         

343
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,007
             My older brother...
                 Says, like,    

344
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,208
            The nastiest shit.  

345
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,277
      Like, he called me "hymen"
            until I was 12.     

346
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,545
  Oh, that's--                  
  that's sick.                  

347
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,046
                     I know.    
That's not                      
even clever.                    

348
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,247
                  [laughs]      
                  I know.       

349
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,982
          You know, I would've  
          gone with something   

350
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,317
At least mildly entertaining.   

351
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,586
        You know, like-- like,  
        "family jewels."        

352
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:08,587
Or like "nuts."                 

353
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,055
Yeah, that's funny.             
                      [laughing]

354
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,157
  That's a fucking              
    funny joke.                 

355
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,659
    Fucking funny.              

356
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,328
                        [sighs] 
can't believe that.             

357
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,097

It's beautifully done.

00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,219
So, what are you                
    doing tonight?              

382
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,821
          Probably nothing. Why?

383
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,190
I don't know. My parents are    
gone, so i'm having a party.    

384
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,492
I don't really know how         
many people are gonna be there, 

385
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,561
 But you could stop by          
if you wanted to.               

386
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,264
        Yeah, I love parties.   

387
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,367
    Really?                     

388
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,203
I just don't really             
ever see you at them.           

389
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,138
                You know,       
         it's a love-hate thing.

390
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:36,542
  So, like, you know, right now,
    I really love them, though. 

391
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,110
                        Yeah.   

392
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,144
    Good shit, right, miroki?   

393
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,546
                          Mm-hm.

394
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,880
                Yeah.           

395
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,683
Hey, miroki, could we have      
a minute alone? Just-- thanks.  

396
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,285
Dude, jules is having           
a fucking party.                

397
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,221
                         Fogell:
                        Hey!    

398
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,789
    Don't tell fogell           
     about the party.           

399
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,658
                 Gangsters.     
              What's up, guys?  

400
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,526
              I was just walking
                down the hall,  

401
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,228
            And that nicola was 
        right in front of me.   

402
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,097
        And she was wearing     
         these tight white pants

403
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,365
                 With this black
                    g-string,   

404
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,367
         And you could see right
         through the pants, man.

405
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,434
                It was so sweet.

406
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,013
                Uh, it's 10:33. 

407
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,049
                [stammers]      

408
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,050
         What?                  

409
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,154
                 I told her     
              what time it was. 

410
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,655
That's the coolest fucking story

411
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,457
I've ever heard                 
in my entire life. Insane.      

412
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,059
Can I hear it again?            
Do you have time?               

413
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,794
             Yeah, yeah, seth.  
          I'll really gonna miss

414
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,163
      Your knee-slappers when me
      and evan are at dartmouth.

415
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,432
While you guys are at dartmouth,
i'll be over at state           

416
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,833
Where the girls                 
are half as smart               

417
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,802
And thus twice as likely        
to fellash me.                  

418
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,471
            What are you guys   
         doing tonight? Asshole.

419
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,774
             We got nothing.    
        Nothing tonight, fogell.

420
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,376
No? Well if nothing comes up,   
    we can get shitfaced again. 

421
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,345
        You're always calling me
          a pussy and whatnot,  

422
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,846
                     But today  
                you're wrong.   

423
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,115
      At lunch, i'm going to    
 the same place mike snider went

424
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,484
                 To pick up     
        my brand-new fake id.   

425
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:57,289
Chicka-chicka, yeah, fake id,   
        fake id. I'm tight.     

426
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,692
That's insane. Evan was like,   
"I heard about this party.      

427
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,327
We shouldn't tell fogell."      
I was like, "no, tell fogell."  

428
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,063
You could buy us booze now.     
It's awesome.                   

429
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,132
              Yeah, i'll--      
    sure, i'll buy the booze.   

430
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,901
          Yeah, man, we're gonna
            get our drinks on.  

431
00:16:08,902 --> 00:16:11,470
 We're gonna party and get crunk
    and rock out, dude.         

432
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,940
              Hayworth:         
    If you're not in this class,
      leave this class. Fogell! 

433
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,408
    Hi!                         

434
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,310
        Okay. I'm-- gotta go.   
Evan: Well done, man.           

435
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,878
Seriously.                      
See you after class.            

436
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,247
Did you tell that idiot         
you're not rooming with him?    

437
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,483
            Not yet. No.        
All right, well, you better.    

438
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,185
    That guy's                  
the fucking anti-poon.          

439
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,487
Seth, it's dishes time.         
What's the holdup?

471
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,408
  I'd give my middle nut

do you hate her so much?

481
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:44,196
                I kind of had

  do it, but whatever. It's...

                     Hey, pussy.

549
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,116
                      Fuck off. 

550
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:53,052
          Just the one, though. 
         Just the one. Not both.

551
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,953
 Girl: I'll call andy and greg. 
          Jules: Okay.          

552
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,488
         And i'll bring the '80s
            dance music.        

553
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,358
                 [all giggle]   
            yeah, yeah.         

554
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,994
     Seth! Hi. There you are.   
 We were just talking about you.

555
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,128
         Here I am.             
                That's weird.   

556
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,329
             Yeah.              

557
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,331
        So you're coming to     
        my party tonight, right?

558
00:21:06,332 --> 00:21:07,599
              'cause it's, like,
                fully on.       

559
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,867
     Yeah, why?                 
  Should I not come?            

560
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:10,536
  'cause I could think          
    of other shit--             

561
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,305
      Oh, no. No. I-- I want you
         to come. I just, um--  

562
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:15,407
      You said something earlier
        about, like, a fake id  

563
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,742
                Or something,   
                    right?      

564
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:19,445
Yeah, i'm gonna get one.        
For "sho," for "sho."           

565
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:21,347
I'm getting that for "sho."     

566
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:23,082
                  [jules laughs]

567
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,017
      Can you get us            
          booze?                

568
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,822
Yeah. I can.                    
I can get you guys alcohol.     

569
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:31,690
              Really? Seriously?
Yes, for sure.                  

570
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:33,425
      Oh, that would be awesome.
              Thank you.        

571
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,893
        Because we're worried   
                about that.     

572
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,061
            That would be great.

573
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,730
              Plus, you know,   
          you scratch our backs,

574
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:38,931
                We'll scratch   
                    yours.      

575
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:41,166
Well, jules, the funny thing    
     about my back is,          

576
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,202
Is that it's located            
    on my cock.                 

577
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:45,671
         [laughs]               
                     [chuckles] 

578
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:46,972
So you do want alcohol?         

579
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,640
 You want some sort             
 of alcohol, or no?             

580
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,376
You do or you don't?            
You do want alcohol.            

581
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,777
                     Um, y-yeah.
You need some.                  

582
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:52,878
        Either way.             

583
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:54,546
                          Well--
either way. Either way's fine.  

584
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,448
              This is actually  
            kind of a big favor.

585
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,217
    'cause my parents left me   
             like 100 bucks     

586
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:00,386
             To, uh, feed myself
                for the week.   

587
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,054
         You know, but the house
             is full of food,   

588
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,023
            So I just thought   
                i'd spend it all

589
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:06,992
      On, you know, extra drinks
         for the party, so...   

590
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,260
Yeah, that's really nice.       

591
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:10,362
I don't think i've ever         
done anything that nice.        

592
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:12,064
                      It's cool?
Yeah.                           

593
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,365
                Okay. Thank you.
         Awesome.               

594
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,933
              I mean, seriously,
                that's really-- 

595
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,635
             That's nice of you.
                  Thank you.    

596
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:20,472
So should I just, uh, get       
a shitload of different shit?   

597
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,074
                      [chuckles]
well, you gotta get me          

598
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:23,575
        Some kyle's             
      killer lemonade.          

599
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,877
Kyle's killer lemonade.         

600
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:27,012
I-- that's kind of gay,         
but I can get it for you.       

601
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,380
                        So, um--
killer.                         

602
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,482
        Okay, so then we will   
              see you tonight.  

603
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,984
                Coach:          
        Go to the ball, guys.   

604
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:34,787
        Evan. Get into the game.

605
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:36,922
Kick it over to me.             

606
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,791
                 Coach:         
        Seth! Get off the field!

607
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:41,293
Dude, get out of here, they're  
gonna make me run laps again.   

608
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:42,928
        Dude, just fucking      
          listen, okay?         

609
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,030
    Jules and her stupid fucking
        friend came up to me,   

610
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,598
              And they asked me 
             to buy her alcohol.

611
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,467
              But not just her, 
            for her whole party.

612
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,601
    You know what that means?   

613
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,637
         By some divine miracle,
            we were paired up,  

614
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,105
                And she actually
                 thought of me. 

615
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:55,674
  Thought of me enough to decide
I was the guy she would trust   

616
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,509
         With the whole fun-ness
              of her party.     

617
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,011
        She wants to fuck me.   

618
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:02,047
            She wants my dick   
         in or around her mouth.

619
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,017
Did you think that maybe she's  
using you to get her alcohol?   

620
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:06,652
She doesn't want your dick.     
                    Yes.        

621
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:07,953
            Of course I thought 
                  of that.      

622
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,022
        That's like the first   
     thing that came to my mind.

623
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:12,491
    My older brother always says
        like the nastiest shit. 

624
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,326
      Like he called me "hymen" 
        until I was 12.         

625
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,628
             Seth, I want to    
                blow you.       

626
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,764
Man, she didn't                 
say that. Come on.              

627
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,666
    All right, she didn't say   
            the second part.    

628
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,067
                  She's got     
              an older brother. 

629
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,869
    She could have asked him,   
        but she asked me.       

630
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,371
            She looked me       
        in the eyes and said:   

631
00:23:25,372 --> 00:23:27,373
            "seth, mom is making
            a pubie salad,      

632
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:29,174
              And I need some   
        seth's own dressing."   

633
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,744
              She's d.T.F.      
        She's down to fuck, man.

634
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,580
            P in vagi.          
      She wants to fuck, man.   

635
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,148
        Tonight is the night    
          that fucking is       

636
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:37,449
    An actual possibility.      

637
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,650
You just sound like an idiot.   

638
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,486
You're not gonna be able        
to sleep with her.              

639
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:43,655
         No. Dude, I know I talk
        a lot of shit, okay?    

640
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,025
 But she's gonna be at the party
    and she's gonna be drunk,   

641
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:48,394
    And she likes me at least   
a little, enough to get with me.

642
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:50,195
            At the very least,  
         i'll make out with her.

643
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,364
          Two weeks, handjob.   
    Month, blowjob. Whatever.   

644
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:54,133
             And then I make her
                my girlfriend.  

645
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:56,301
        And i've got, like,     
        two solid months of sex.

646
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,936
             By the time college
                rolls around,   

647
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,572
      I'll be like the iron chef
        of pounding vag.        

648
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:01,774
Can we talk about this later?   

649
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,709
What the fuck, evan?            
We're down two points.          

650
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,878
Fucking calm down, greg.        
      It's soccer.              

651
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:07,079
     It's soccer.               

652
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,480
                Fuck you, man.  

653
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,449
        Hey, why don't you go   
          piss your pants again?

654
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,917
    That was eight years ago,   
                asshole.        

655
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,252
            People don't forget.

656
00:24:13,253 --> 00:24:15,487
            Do you want to hear 
        the best part? Becca.   

657
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:17,489
        You do the same thing   
                 with her.      

658
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,958
When you guys are shitfaced     
 at the party, you get with her.

659
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,828
          This is our last party
          as high-school people.

660
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,596
              I've fully ignored
             my hatred for becca

661
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:25,998
                In coming up    
                 with this plan.

662
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:28,133
            I'm flexing nuts.   
    Just fucking come with me   

663
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,601
            On this voyage,     
             and just stop being

664
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,736
              A pussy for once. 

665
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,571
        And we can fucking      
        fuck some girls already.

666
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,641
I should buy becca alcohol?     

667
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:36,742
            Yeah. It'll be pimp!

668
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,243
            That way you know   
                she'll be drunk.

669
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:39,778
          You know when you hear
              a girl saying:    

670
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:41,613
         "ah, I was so shitfaced
            last night.         

671
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,148
                I shouldn't     
          have fucked that guy."

672
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,616
    We could be that mistake!   

673
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,320
Have you talked to fogell?      

674
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,022
                  All right,    
              you talk to becca.

675
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:52,324
    I'll talk to that retard,   
          fogell. Don't worry.  

676
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,760
[whistle blows]                 
coach: Seth, get off the field! 

677
00:24:54,761 --> 00:24:55,894
                          Goal. 

678
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,696
You're getting that!            
                    No, i'm not!

679
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:58,797
      [indistinct chatter]      

680
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:03,402
    Hey, becca. Hey. Hold up.   

681
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:04,570
    Oh, hey.                    
                      Hey, um...

682
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:05,637
              Hi, uh, did you--?

683
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,239
              Did you hear about
              the party tonight?

684
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,408
Yeah. Yeah, I just heard.       
It sounds awesome.              

685
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:11,610
             Yeah. Ahem.        
        Yeah, i'm going.        

686
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,112
  Really?                       
    Yeah, i'm gonna go to it.   

687
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:14,980
      That's actually why I came
        looking for you.        

688
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,383
Me and the guys are gonna go    
  to a liquor store after class.

689
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:18,884
    And I just thought,         
          you know, if...       

690
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,286
         You needed someone     
    to get you yours, I--       

691
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,022
         I could do that.       
     I could be that person.    

692
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,024
        Yeah. Um--              

693
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,658
Yeah, no, that would be great.  

694
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,060
  That would save me            
    such a hassle,              

695
00:25:28,061 --> 00:25:30,262
'cause I was gonna beg          
my sister, but--                
                oh...           

696
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:32,831
Could you get me, like,         
a bottle of goldslick vodka?    

697
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:35,634
    Yeah. That's the one with   
 the little golden flakes in it?

698
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:37,703
    Yeah. The girly one.        
                  That's classy.

699
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,472
Um, okay, well, i'll pay you    
back at the party, then.        

700
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:42,374
        No, no, you won't.      
        No, it's my treat, miss.

701
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,842
          Really?               
        Yep, and that's that.   

702
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:46,679
     It's the first of many too,
      so get used to it, sister.

703
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,314
Oh, well, thank you.            

704
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:50,282
            Yeah, no problem.   
                     You--      

705
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,884
                        Oh...   

706
00:25:58,124 --> 00:25:59,725
              I'm sorry.        
         That guy walked by--   

707
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,093
             It was an accident.
        It's okay.              

708
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:03,462
  I was gonna give you a nudge--
    a punch, the friend thing.  

709
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:04,463
             I didn't mean--    

710
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:06,131
Gaby: Hey, becca.               
            Oh. Hey.            

711
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,199
Hey.                            
            Gaby.               

712
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,567
What's up, evan?                
              Hey, gaby.        

713
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,936
We should get to class.         
Becca: We're gonna go to class. 

714
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,004
So I will see you tonight.      

715
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,305
              Okay.             
Really, don't worry.            

716
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,440
        Okay. Sorry.            

717
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:16,709
                Bye.            
        Sorry.                  

718
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,177
                         # bye #

719
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,213
          Sorry. Heh.           

720
00:26:21,214 --> 00:26:23,449
             [#]                

721
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,522
Where's that sack               
of shit, fogell?                

722
00:26:30,523 --> 00:26:31,890
  He said he'd be here          
      after lunch.              

723
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:33,258
 I'm here with my thumb         
    up my ass.                  

724
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,461
        I did it, dude. I--     
I even offered to pay for it.   

725
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:37,529
        It was pimp. Like--     
I feel like a pimp right now.   

726
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,597
                  Like one of   
                  those pimps.  

727
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:40,199
Whoa, that <i>is</i> fucking pimp.     

728
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,433
            That's what I was   
                afraid of.      

729
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,702
 Why didn't I think             
of that? Shit!                  

730
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,804
          [bell rings]          

731
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,306
Sh-- we're screwed.             

732
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:48,774
Okay? We're screwed.            
                         Okay.  

733
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,843
      That's what we fucking get
         for trusting fogell.   

734
00:26:50,844 --> 00:26:53,178
          He pussied out. I know
              he pussied out.   

735
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:55,814
        What are you making?    

736
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,616
I'm just                        
drilling holes.                 

737
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:58,751
Last two weeks.                 

738
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,986
  Fuck it.                      

739
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:02,688
What are we supposed to         
tell the girls?                 

740
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:04,656
That we couldn't do             
the one thing we promised,      

741
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:06,358
Because we're                   
dickless incompetents.          

742
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,261
We're never gonna bone because  
of that used tampon, fogell.    

743
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:10,629
How'd he get into dartmouth?    

744
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,998
I don't get it.                 
He's got shit for brains.       

745
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,300
All right, how else             
can we get alcohol?             

746
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,069
Fogell:                         
Yo, guys! What's up?            

747
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,437
                 Evan:          
    Where have you been, man?   

748
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,539
            You almost gave me  
         a goddamn heart attack.

749
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,441
            Let me see it.      
     Did you pussy out, or what?

750
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:23,942
No, no, man. I got it.          

751
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,878
It's flawless. Check it.        

752
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:27,479
                      Hawaii?   

753
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,315
                Evan:           
    All right, that's good.     
    It's hard to trace, I guess.

754
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,852
     Wait, you changed your name
             to mclovin?        

755
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:34,987
             Yeah.              

756
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:37,122
                        Mclovin?

757
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:38,924
      What kind of a stupid name
        is that, fogell?        

758
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:40,926
      What, are you trying to be
          an irish r&b singer?  

759
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,429
They let you pick any name you  
want when you get down there.   

760
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,230
    And you landed              
     on mclovin?                

761
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:47,599
Yeah, it was between that       
or mohammad.                    

762
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,968
    Why the fuck would it be    
     between that and mohammad?!

763
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,171
 Why not just pick a common name
        like a normal person?   

764
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,972
Mohammad is the most common name
        on earth.               

765
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:55,507
 Read a fucking book for once.

        Have you ever met anyone
             named mohammad?    

767

Have you ever met anyone        
named mclovin?                  

768
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,847
     No, that's why you picked  
        a dumb fucking name.

go into the liquor store        

781
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:26,138
With their fake ids, and every  
single one says they're 21.     

782
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:28,507
How many 21-year-olds you think 
    there are in this town?     

783

            This isn't terrible.

788
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:41,220

  "here's a kid with a fake id,"

789
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,789
          Or "here's mclovin,

    I told you not to park here.

00:37:02,455 --> 00:37:05,090
I brought a little bottle       
of spermicidal lube too.        

983
00:37:07,494 --> 00:37:08,794
      But you laughed in my face

984
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:10,529
              When I said i'd be
             having sex tonight.

985
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,032
Yeah, that doesn't mean you     
shouldn't always be prepared.   

986
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:14,333
You didn't even bring a condom? 

987
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,567
                    No.         

988
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:17,403
        No, evan, that wasn't   
             part of the plan.  

989
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:19,805
    I can't believe you did this
     without consulting with me.

990
00:37:19,806 --> 00:37:22,174
Plan? We've never discussed,    
like, any plan,                 

991
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:23,709
But you keep saying             
we have a plan.                 

992
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,812
          I had, like, a general
            outline. You know?  

993
00:37:26,813 --> 00:37:29,815
    I was gonna go down on her  
 for, like, several hours, okay?

994
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:31,784
          She would love that.  
    She'd be smitten by that.   

995
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:32,951
                    She'd go out
                     with that. 

996
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:34,820
          Or I dry hump the shit
              out of her leg.   

997
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:36,655
Okay, well, I just--            
I don't see the harm            

998
00:37:36,656 --> 00:37:38,090
In bringing                     
one little condom.              

999
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:40,392
        And one little bottle   
            of spermicidal lube?

1000
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:43,195
Yeah, one little bottle         
of spermicidal lube.

00:37:43,196 --> 00:37:44,963

                  shit, man.

        What, do you think      
        becca's gonna be psyched

1005
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:51,170
          That you brought lube?

1006
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:53,138
                "oh, evan.

             been able to handle

      gigantic bottle of lube." 

1011
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:03,048
Okay, that's-- that's enough.   
                        Fuck.   

1012
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:06,051
  These girls are 18 years old, 
they're not dried-up old ladies.

1013
00:38:06,052 --> 00:38:07,019
             They're good to go.

1014
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,220
Then I won't bring the lube.    

1015
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:09,888
Don't make me                   
feel like that.                 

1016
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:11,390

it was cool.                    

1017
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:12,691

                  for a second. 

1019

    Actually is kind of cool.

     Been drinking it for years.

 You know, I heard they recently
 decided to add more hops to it.

    Um, okay.

    breast-reduction surgery.

1087
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:21,580
 Okay, so we have an african jew
        wearing a hoodie.       

1088
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:22,948
                No. You don't.  
No.                             

1089
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,183
                No. That's not  
                 what I said.   

1090
00:41:24,184 --> 00:41:25,451
                 Is that what   
              you heard me say? 

1091
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:26,819
              I said, he looked 
                  like you.     

1092
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,320
            Do you look like    
            an african jew?     

1093
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:30,322
                No, I look like 
                     a cop.     

1094
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:31,390
     Yeah.                      

1095
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:32,491
                    [sighs]     

1096
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,927
              He was caucasian. 

1097
00:41:34,928 --> 00:41:35,894
                    Caucasian.  
    Oh.                         

1098
00:41:35,895 --> 00:41:36,895
    All right.                  
                    Okay.       

1099
00:41:36,896 --> 00:41:38,030
  Well, touch.                 

1100
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:39,732
                  Kind of looked
                like eminem.    

1101
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:40,799
      Oh.                       
                    Does that   
                    help you?   

1102
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,834
                    An m&m.     
 Eminem-menem.                  

1103
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,002
So he was circular--            

1104
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,169
            Marshall mathers.   

1105
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,170
             Eminem? The rapper.

1106
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:46,205
                     Eminem.    

1107
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:48,007
          Did he look like this?

1108
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,675
                I'm an amateur. 
                 I kind of--    

1109
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:51,343
'cause that kind of             
looks like an m&m.              

1110
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:53,379
    Michaels:                   
Longer face,                    
    bigger nose?                

1111
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,481
         Would you say his mouth
            was wider...        

1112
00:41:55,482 --> 00:41:57,216
                     Open?      
                    A gap?      

1113
00:41:57,217 --> 00:42:00,185
      Is there another squad car
          that's in the area,   

1114
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,388
    That could probably be of   
          further assistance?   
No.                             

1115
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,089
             I don't seem to be 
                getting any.    

1116
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:06,325
Okay, so just                   
walk me through again           

1117
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:07,326
What this guy did.              

1118
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:09,028
He-- he-- he--                  
he came in,                     

1119
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:10,596
He was wielding a...            

1120
00:42:10,597 --> 00:42:12,164
He was wielding                 
something.                      

1121
00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:13,766
He hits                         
the small gentleman in--        

1122
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:14,800
 In the slacks.                 

1123
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,568
And then he jumps               
over you,                       

1124
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:18,237
  He feels you up,              
violates you.                   

1125
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:19,238
                    I did not   
                    say that.   

1126
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,239
  No, he doesn't.               

1127
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,907
          Look, I can't do this.

1128
00:42:21,908 --> 00:42:23,842
        I told you already,     
        I have an exam tomorrow.

1129
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:25,244
        Can you understand that?

1130
00:42:25,245 --> 00:42:27,379
              I have a goddamn  
              veterinary exam!  

1131
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,747
                      [whimpers]

1132
00:42:28,748 --> 00:42:30,716
              Goddamn it.       
        This is bullshit.       

1133
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:31,717
This is                         
some bullshit.                  

1134
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:33,652
I got an exam tomorrow.         
Forget this.                    

1135
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,721
  Well, apparently              
someone has an exam.            

1136
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,623
Michaels:                       
How'd you know?                 

1137
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:39,358
You. You're the one             

1138
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,826
            That got punched?   
              Yeah.             

1139
00:42:40,827 --> 00:42:41,927
Okay.                           

1140
00:42:41,928 --> 00:42:43,696
             First things first.
              What is your name?

1141
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,631
        Uh...                   

1142
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:50,102
                My name?        

1143
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:53,205
    It's m-- mclov-- mclovin.   

1144
00:42:54,507 --> 00:42:56,141
                    Mclovin?    

1145
00:42:56,142 --> 00:42:58,610
                  Yeah. Mm-hm.  

1146
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:01,714
Now, what's your first name?    
                  What?         

1147
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,749
Your first name?                
                        My first
                          name? 

1148
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,552
      Te-- technically,         
  I don't have a first name,    

1149
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:09,621
      So-- so don't worry       
     about my first name.       

1150
00:43:10,557 --> 00:43:12,925
        But we're the police.   

1151
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,893
                Slater:         
              We just wanna get 
             the story straight.

1152
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:17,429
                        Come on.
                  Fuck, man.    

1153
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:18,530
                        Come on!

1154
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:20,265
            He must be          
            so afraid.          

1155
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:21,633
I don't believe                 
this bullshit.                  

1156
00:43:21,634 --> 00:43:23,435
        I can't believe         
    this is happening!          

1157
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:25,604
    I didn't know you could     
     get arrested for this shit.

1158
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:27,172
                    We need     
                    that liquor.

1159
00:43:27,173 --> 00:43:29,141
Are they gonna, like,           
take him downtown?              

1160
00:43:29,142 --> 00:43:30,342
                  Fuck fogell.  

1161
00:43:30,343 --> 00:43:32,011
          He got arrested, okay?
             We're on our own.  

1162
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:33,445
            We need a new way   
                  to get liq--  

1163
00:43:33,446 --> 00:43:35,347
                    Aw, fuck!   
                 The money, man!

1164
00:43:35,348 --> 00:43:37,583
          Fuck! H-how much money
            can you get?        

1165
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:39,985
Why are you talking about money,
man? What about fogell?         

1166
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:41,587
            Wha--? That         
         doesn't matter anymore.

1167
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:43,789
        I lost a hundred dollars
            of jules' money.    

1168
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,557
        What are we gonna do,   
        bust him out of jail?   

1169
00:43:45,558 --> 00:43:47,593
        Bake him a cake with    
          a fucking file in it?!

1170
00:43:47,594 --> 00:43:49,461
          Fuck fogell. We need  
        a new way to get liquor,

1171
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:51,830
     Which is fucking impossible
     'cause we don't have money.

1172
00:43:51,831 --> 00:43:53,532
All right, you just             
need to calm down.              

1173
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:56,301
We need to think for a second.  
We just need to think this out. 

1174
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:57,936
  Fuck thinking, we need to act!

1175
00:43:57,937 --> 00:43:59,071
[tires screeching]              

1176
00:43:59,806 --> 00:44:01,473
          Whoa, seth!           

1177
00:44:01,474 --> 00:44:02,541
         What the fuck          
        happened?               

1178
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,510
             Just-- just get up.
                Slowly.         

1179
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:06,412
                  You all right?
                     You okay?  

1180
00:44:06,413 --> 00:44:07,479
                  Ah!           

1181
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,181
    I am so sorry, man.         

1182
00:44:09,182 --> 00:44:10,616
                I am so sorry.  

1183
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:13,585
            I didn't even effing
            see you at all, man.

1184
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:14,820
              Are you okay?     

1185
00:44:14,821 --> 00:44:17,523
So it's just mclovin?           

1186
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:20,759
                Yeah. Mm-hm.    

1187
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,694
            That's badass.      

1188
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:23,162
That is badass.                 

1189
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:24,596
Michaels:                       
Really cool.                    

1190
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:26,365
Lot of people with              
weird names nowadays.           

1191
00:44:26,366 --> 00:44:27,499
              Chingy. Shakira.

00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,134
Rafe. Pax.                      

1193
00:44:29,135 --> 00:44:32,471
We arrested a man-lady          
who was legally named "fuck."   

1194
00:44:32,472 --> 00:44:34,473
        Think he was vietnamese,
        it was with a p-h.      

1195
00:44:34,474 --> 00:44:36,709
  But it's still pretty shocking
        to see on a license.    

1196
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:37,943
Okay, and, uh,

                 Old enough.    

1199
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:42,881
Old enough for what?            

1200
00:44:45,585 --> 00:44:47,019
                 To party.      

1201
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:52,958

1202
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:56,528
        Yeah, I think I have it.

1203

00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:18,117
         [inaudible dialogue]   

1205
00:45:20,553 --> 00:45:21,620
You're an organ donor.

1208
00:45:24,257 --> 00:45:26,125
I didn't want to be one,        
but my wife insisted.           

1209
00:45:26,126 --> 00:45:28,093
         I always give him shit 
    for it too. All the time.   

1210
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:30,162
                 I say,         
        "it's just like a woman.

1211

     Even after you're dead     
they wanna tear your heart out."

1212

They wanna tear your...         

1213
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:36,201
I say it weekly,                
and it's still funny.           

1214
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:37,536
                     It still   
                 makes me laugh.

1215
00:45:37,537 --> 00:45:39,204

            Dude, stop!         

1615
01:00:15,482 --> 01:00:16,682
Bill, bill! Check it out!       

1616
01:00:16,683 --> 01:00:18,784
This kid's got period           
blood on his slacks.            

1617
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:21,387
             It's merlot.       
      That's what you don't get.

1618
01:00:21,388 --> 01:00:24,323
Hey, pat! This jerk-off's       
got period blood on his pants!  

1619
01:00:24,324 --> 01:00:25,791
                    Pat:        
        God, man, let me see.   

1620
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,694
        Oh, my god, that's      
        a fucking man-gina, man.

1621
01:00:28,695 --> 01:00:30,229
Hey, do you need                
a tampon? I could--             

1622
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,564
    Wait, wait. I have one!     
          I have one!           

1623
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:35,200
        Yeah, right?            
        I don't know.           

1624
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:37,169
 I gotta wash this merlot off.  
    Is this the line?           

1625
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,071
What does it look like?         
     Fuck me, right?

        Rewind it. Yeah!

Oh, my god. That is             
bona fide badass, man.          

1635
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:15,007
Oh, you gotta keep that tape,   
mclovin. It-- it is badass.     

1636
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:16,542
It really is.                   
                         Really?

1637
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:19,144
     Well, don't you guys, like,
    need it for, like, evidence?

1638
01:01:19,145 --> 01:01:20,813
    No. The only thing          
    that's evidence of          

1639
01:01:20,814 --> 01:01:22,681
     Is you can take a hit      
    like a champ, man.          

1640
01:01:22,682 --> 01:01:24,850
     Seriously. Take that.      
                     Oh, uh--   

1641
01:01:24,851 --> 01:01:28,921
    Are there any ladies we'd   
      like to show this tape to?

1642

            No.

01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,959
  You don't wanna meet a chick  
in a bar, man. Seriously.       

1644
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,728
 That was a major turning point 
          in my life,           

1645
01:01:35,729 --> 01:01:36,795
    Is when I realized that.    

1646
01:01:36,796 --> 01:01:38,130
        You gotta go to         
         other places.          

1647
01:01:38,131 --> 01:01:41,200
 You gotta go to a spin class,  
    a farmers' market,

        non-threatening.        

1650
01:01:46,773 --> 01:01:48,140
      You know, something       
        like that.              

1651
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:50,209
Yeah, I met the missis          
at paintball.                   

1652
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:53,379
Yeah, I shot her                
in the neck. And we just...     

1653
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,447
And we just hit it off,         
you know.                       

1654
01:01:55,448 --> 01:01:59,084
My first wife--                 
who is a whore, by the way      

1655
01:01:59,085 --> 01:02:00,619
--Where do you think            
I met her?                      

1656
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,422
A bar. A bar.                   

1657
01:02:03,423 --> 01:02:04,656
        [whispers]              
        it was this bar.        

1658
01:02:04,657 --> 01:02:05,858
It was this bar.                

1659
01:02:05,859 --> 01:02:08,293
Yeah, it was this bar.          

1660
01:02:08,294 --> 01:02:09,294
Bought her a binion's,          

1661
01:02:09,295 --> 01:02:12,531
Complimented her                
on her tote bag,                

1662
01:02:12,532 --> 01:02:14,299
And next thing                  
I know, she's...                

1663
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,302
Putting her mouth               
around the tip of my penis.     

1664
01:02:17,303 --> 01:02:20,105
        Uh, don't-- you don't   
        have to tell me that.   

1665
01:02:20,106 --> 01:02:21,106
        Right in there.         

1666
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:23,075
She opened up my world,         
sexually.                       

1667
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:25,678
On our wedding night,           
we had, uh, group sex.          

1668
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:27,146
I mean, I wasn't                
involved in it.                 

1669
01:02:27,147 --> 01:02:30,015
But I-- I could hear it         
through the wall.               
                      I was.    

1670
01:02:30,016 --> 01:02:31,016
She was                         
amazing.                        

1671
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:33,185
And then it was                 
exactly 23 months later         

1672
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:35,320
That I found out                
that she was an actual whore.   

1673
01:02:35,321 --> 01:02:36,822
        We discovered her       
          on the street.        

1674
01:02:36,823 --> 01:02:37,856
Yeah.                           

1675
01:02:37,857 --> 01:02:39,258
                      I'm sorry.

She was bad.

1677
01:02:41,661 --> 01:02:43,729
              But you got       
        a new wife now, so...   

1678
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:45,297
Yeah... Yeah, yeah. Yeah!       

1679
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:47,700
And, uh, she is                 
wonderful.                      

1680

01:45:24,557 --> 01:45:26,592
          I should've told you. 

2774
01:45:26,593 --> 01:45:28,827
      I don't know why I didn't.

2775
01:45:28,828 --> 01:45:31,864
     Don't-- no, don't be sorry.
          I should be sorry.    

2776
01:45:31,865 --> 01:45:34,733
        I was being a dick.     
  I was being a big dick to you.

2777
01:45:34,734 --> 01:45:36,268
              No, I-- uh--      

2778
01:45:36,269 --> 01:45:38,303
              Listen, seth,     
        I want you to know,     

2779
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:40,939
          I don't wanna live    
             with fogell.       

2780
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:43,275
            I never wanted to   
             live with him.     

2781
01:45:43,276 --> 01:45:45,978
     I just don't-- I ha-- I--  

2782
01:45:45,979 --> 01:45:48,180
        I'm afraid to live      
         with strangers.        

2783
01:45:50,083 --> 01:45:51,183
I can't--                       

2784
01:45:52,352 --> 01:45:53,552
        I can't do it.

2787
01:45:59,693 --> 01:46:01,960
I can't believe                 
you saved me.                   

2788
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:06,532
You saved me. Heh.              

2789
01:46:06,533 --> 01:46:09,468
I can't believe--               
I owe you so--                  

2790
01:46:10,437 --> 01:46:12,438
    You carried me.

01:46:12,439 --> 01:46:14,006
          I love you.

 I'm not...Even embarrassed     
    to say it. I just--

01:46:27,821 --> 01:46:29,888
    I lo-- I love you.

01:46:29,889 --> 01:46:31,890
         I'm not embarrassed.   
                     I love you.

01:46:31,891 --> 01:46:33,192
              I love you.       

2799
01:46:33,193 --> 01:46:35,060
    It's like-- why don't we say
        that every day?         

2800
01:46:35,061 --> 01:46:36,395
             Why can't we say it
                 more often?    

2801
01:46:36,396 --> 01:46:37,629
      I just love you.          
    I just wanna go             

2802
01:46:37,630 --> 01:46:38,897
To the rooftops and scream:     

2803
01:46:38,898 --> 01:46:40,366
"I love my best friend, evan."  

2804
01:46:40,367 --> 01:46:42,067
                We should go up 
                  on my roof.

          for easter, wha--     

2807
01:46:46,006 --> 01:46:48,507
         On your vacation...    

2808
01:46:48,508 --> 01:46:50,175
            I missed you.       

2809

      I missed you too.

        the most beautiful thing

2812

            I should get moving.

            I should be getting 
        a move on, for "sho."

Yeah, you don't have-- I mean,  
you don't have to, you know.    

2826
01:47:55,308 --> 01:47:58,377
I don't really                  
have anything...Going on.       

2827

Uh, you don't have to           
rush off like that.

                 to the mall.   

2830
01:48:09,823 --> 01:48:12,758
I have to get, uh,              
a new comforter...              

2831
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:14,860
  For college.

they would sell that.

            Cool. So, uh...

'cause I-I don't give           
a shit how pants look.          

2838
01:48:30,443 --> 01:48:33,078
          Yeah. I need          
    someone's opinion.

too tight. Heh.                 

2840

            Yeah, but, like--

Way too tight.

not enough pants, where         

2844
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:42,154
There should be                 
more pant there.                

2845
01:48:42,155 --> 01:48:43,389
        Yeah, but--             
        I mean...               

2846
01:48:43,390 --> 01:48:44,490
    Does it look weird?         

2847

Looks like you're               
standing funny.                 

2848
01:48:45,959 --> 01:48:47,760
Like, you wouldn't be           
standing like that.             

2849
01:48:47,761 --> 01:48:49,628
 Like a duck.                   
                Yeah, but i'm   
                 doing, like--  

2850
01:48:49,629 --> 01:48:51,630
              I'm doing, uh,    
              college poses.    

2851
01:48:51,631 --> 01:48:52,998
                Like--          
I don't know if you are.        

2852
01:48:52,999 --> 01:48:54,400
You might just                  
be doing...                     

2853
01:48:54,401 --> 01:48:56,001
            Hey, prof...        
 Okay.                          

2854
01:48:56,002 --> 01:48:57,836
...That test was, whoo!         

2855
01:48:57,837 --> 01:49:00,005
        Hey, susan.             
You look--                      

2856
01:49:00,006 --> 01:49:02,307
        Are you gonna           
        party tonight, or no?   

2857
01:49:02,308 --> 01:49:04,176
Yeah, but it's just--           
uh, it's, like, I wish          

2858
01:49:04,177 --> 01:49:06,145
  There were more               
  pants w-wearing.              

2859
01:49:06,146 --> 01:49:07,613
You know. Where                 
there aren't--                  

2860
01:49:07,614 --> 01:49:09,782
    But when I was wearing      
    your dad's pants last night,

2861
01:49:09,783 --> 01:49:11,784
    I realized that if I wear   
         pants that are, like,  

2862
01:49:11,785 --> 01:49:13,552
            A little too small, 
        it might encourage me   

2863
01:49:13,553 --> 01:49:14,553
        To lose a little weight.

2864
01:49:14,554 --> 01:49:15,954
      And also chicks can       
          kind of see,          

2865
01:49:15,955 --> 01:49:19,625
  Like, you know, the borders   
and outline of my dick a little.

2866
01:49:19,626 --> 01:49:21,260
Yeah, man.                      
They go nuts for that.          

2867
01:49:21,261 --> 01:49:22,795
The male camel toe.             

2868
01:49:22,796 --> 01:49:26,031
     Yeah, the camel tail.      
      It's-- it's right--       

2869
01:49:26,032 --> 01:49:27,833
I know where it is,             
where it happens.               

2870
01:49:27,834 --> 01:49:29,635
    Like, right there.          

2871
01:49:29,636 --> 01:49:31,870
See-- it-- they're so tight     
that one ball is, like,         

2872
01:49:31,871 --> 01:49:33,372
Above my dick, even.            

2873
01:49:33,373 --> 01:49:35,274
     Yeah, exactly.             
                It's like three.

2874
01:49:35,275 --> 01:49:38,110
 It's like a three thing.       
It's like ball, dick, ball.     

2875
01:49:38,111 --> 01:49:39,778
It's like-- it's                
like a division sign.           

2876
01:49:39,779 --> 01:49:41,747
          It's like a bunch     
of people crammed into a van.   

2877
01:49:41,748 --> 01:49:44,550
          Uh, does my ass       
            look weird?         

2878
01:49:44,551 --> 01:49:46,352
It makes a lot of               
stuff look weird.               

2879
01:49:46,353 --> 01:49:48,354
No. Those are                   
way too tight.                  

2880
01:49:48,355 --> 01:49:50,255
          You're right.         
        These look stupid.      

2881
01:49:50,256 --> 01:49:51,724
        Let's get the fuck      
        out of here.

I have-- I have my dad's car.
