170
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,640
Watch out!

Aah!

174
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Watch out!

175
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,520
Well, I guess you
don't want the baby.

176
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,000
Sir, your car will be
ready in a minute.

177
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,440
You're lucky

178
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,360
the engine's
in the back.

179
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,800
[Samuel]
Yeah. Right.

180
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,560
Hi.

181
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,480
Ready in a minute.

182
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,920
Good.

183
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,840
So, um...

184
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,200
we are absolutely certain
about this, right?

185
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,600
Well, my period's
10 days late.

186
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,720
Right.

187
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,080
And there's no way
you could have had it

188
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,480
and just not noticed?

189
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,200
Sorry. Ridiculous.
That was stupid. Stupid.

190
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,600
Could you be a little
more positive about this,

191
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,520
more supportive?

192
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm trying to
be positive.

193
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,960
Killing us in a head-on
collision is not positive.

194
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,720
It must have been shock.

195
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,200
Out of the blue,
you say you're pregnant.

196
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,600
It was just
a little bit unexpected

197
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,000
was probably the reason
for the crash.

198
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,440
I thought you were
using birth control.

199
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,400
I was.

200
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,520
Your car's ready now,
sir.

201
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,720
Great.

202
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,480
Oh...

203
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,400
you don't believe me!

204
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,680
No?

205
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,640
You think I got pregnant
behind your back.

206
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,960
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,400
Do you think
I planned this?

208
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,280
I'm as flipped out
as you are.

209
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,720
I suppose
I just thought

210
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,160
that birth control

211
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,360
had a little teeny element
of control about it.

212
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,240
Thought it was supposed
to be foolproof.

213
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Nothing is foolproof.
It's only 97% effective.

214
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,840
It says so on the box.

215
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,680
Yeah. Right.
97% effective.

216
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,080
So 3% completely
bloody ineffective.

217
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,200
They should put that
on the box.

218
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,640
Here you are.

219

Who's the blonde?

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,120
No idea.

Oh, my God.

I was getting worried
about you guys.

233
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,400
What happened
to this car?

234
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,840
Oh, long story.

235

[Quietly]
What happened to Christine?

236
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,520
A long story.

237
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,400
So this is where
you two are going to stay.

Yeah, lovely.

So, what do you
think of her?

What,
you mean the blonde?

241

She's attractive.
Very attractive.

242
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,520
She's 25 years old.

243
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,880
Her skin
is like ribbon candy.

244
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,680
Breasts
like sponge cake.

245
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
Her calves
are like calzone.

246
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,520
I mean,
highly edible.

247
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,960
Highly edible.

248
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
She's crazy
about sex.

to get me over
the rough spots.

251

Mmm. What do you mean?
What rough spots?

252
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh, Christine
left me.

Oh, shit.

When?

255

Oh, uh...
a week ago.

256
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,640
What happened?

257
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,240
Well...

258
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,960
she wanted
a child.

260
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm sorry.

Yep. Yep.
What an idiot.

Got it.

265

She said she wanted...

266
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,520
She, uh...
Christine wanted a baby.

267
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,440
She was hungry
for seed,

268
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,840
so I closed
the iron door,

269
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,640
denied her
my essence.

270
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,720
You know,
I'm not ready

271
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,440
to be biologically
extraneous.

272
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,360
She would have
devoured me

273
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,160
from the head down,

chewed up
my manhood,

275
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,400
swallowed my youth,
and gobbled me up

276
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,080
like some
praying mantis.

277
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,520
Not for me.

278
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,840
What do you mean,
praying mantis?

279
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,280
The female mantis,

280

after she has sex
with her mate,

281
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
she eats him.

282

Oh, yeah.

283
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,960
But Christine
wasn't pregnant

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,200
or anything
like that?

285
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,520
No. What do you mean?
Like on the sly?

286

has her faults,

who would do that.

What? Yeah?

Huh?

Aah! What is it?

Aah!

What's the matter?
Come here, kiddo.

Come here, you.

She's going through
a hiding phase.

It's for attention.

Hey, honey,
you'll get it dirty,

and God knows
what's on there.

Oh, hi.

This is great. Don't worry.
We didn't bring a kite.

We found her.

We've been looking
for her for an hour.

Honey, tell the neighbors
to call off the search.

You, call the sheriff
before the choppers go up.

We're sorry.
Looks like a full house.

Sounds great.
Good to see you.

You didn't tell me
they were coming.

They didn't
tell me either.

Oh,

They're monsters.

I don't want kids.

[Sean]
It's nonsense.

377
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,880
No, what I'm saying is

378
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,240
I think it's such baloney
and such a cliché

379
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,120
that the artist
has to be messed up

380
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,600
and have a life
of deprivation,

381
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,480
be an alcoholic
or deprived in some way.

382

It's how you use, obviously,
with imagination and passion

Marry me.
Make me your wife.

It's kind of cute.

Oh, shit. Not another one.

So I'd like to
make a toast.

You could be
the toughest guy,

419

but when your child
looks into your eyes

420
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,160
and that child knows
you're their dad...

about my wife and I
having another baby.

440
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,280
Is being excited a reason

441
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,200
to exclude eight people
from conversation?

442

Right.

I can't be a father.

I can't.
I ca... I... I...

504
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,600
Why would I want to
have a child?

505
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,400
Just so he can call me a bastard
in 10 years' time?

506
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,320
We'd have to move out.

507

We don't have space
for a child.

That's how it should be.

No. Wait.

522
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,000
Wait. This pregnancy
was an accident.

523
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,400
It took us
completely by surprise.

Right.

We've been doing
really great together,

526
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,160
and a baby
would change everything.

527
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,600
I suppose it could.

528
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,480
Our apartment's
not ready for a baby.

529

No.

530

We'd have to
redecorate.

Yep.

532
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,240
I'd have to
quit my job.

533

Nobody wants
a pregnant dance teacher.

We're not ready
for a child.

535
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,400
There's not one good reason
to keep this baby.

536
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,160
But I still want to.

537

Right.

Maybe it's crazy,

539
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,880
but I feel it
living inside me.

00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,880
Oh, my God.

665
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,320
On March 17th,
I was away

666
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,280
at a child psychiatry conference
in Boston, remember?

667
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,840
What are you
saying?

668
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,800
I'll leave you two alone.

669
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,800
That's fine.
I'm going.

670
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,200
No! Wait!
Come back! Sit down!

671
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,640
Samuel, sit down!

672
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,080
Check your computer
again!

673
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,960
It is... the computer
is very accurate.

674
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,840
Check the goddamn
computer.

675
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,840
Check it!

676
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,280
Don't yell at me!
Please don't do this.

677
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,960
I spent a year
in Afghanistan.

678
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,840
I have sometimes
very low tolerance for pressure.

679
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,840
Come on!

680
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,720
O.K. What is wrong
with the thing?

681
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,120
Oh, fuck me!
It's not working.

682
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,560
[Cursing In Russian]

683
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,960
Hold on. O.K.
What is wrong?

684
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,760
Oh, O.K. O.K.
Excuse me.

685
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,120
This is the problem.

686
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,880
It is feces
flying into the fan.

687
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,280
There are function keys
for humans and simians,

688
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,720
and you're not a simian.

689
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,160
No, I'm not.

690
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,520
I had you as a baboon.

691
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,480
Sorry. I didn't...

692
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,000
There you go.
Were you here March 23rd?

693
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,960
Yeah.

694
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,320
With her?

695
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,520
- Yes.
- Yes.

696
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,920
O.K., um,
everything is fine now.

697
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,800
We're all back on-line,
and your baby...

698
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,000
<i>your baby will be born
on December 15th.</i>

699
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,120
O.K. Now it is time
for the physical examination.

700
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,480
Let's take a look
at your Volvo, O. K?

701
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,080
Come with me into here.
I'll warm my hands for you.

702
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,360
Please come in.

703
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,760
All right, madam.

704
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,000
If you would get undressed,
we'll begin, O. K?

705
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,120
And you may stay,
sir, if you like.

706
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,560
That's fine.
I'll wait...

707
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,000
Don't you dare.

708
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,680
I'd like to
stay.

709
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,560
Very good.
Let me get ready for you.

710
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,840
O.K.

711
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,800
We've worked out
all the insects.

712
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,360
Giddyup.

713
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,000
[Whispers]
Run.

714
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,320
That lunatic
is not delivering me.

715
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,240
That's fine.
He's just a replacement.

716
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,080
Dr. Green will be there.

717
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,720
Let me help you, honey.
Just be gentle!

718
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,640
Honey, listen,
I was thinking,

719
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,080
about the baby...

720
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,960
Let's just keep it
to ourselves, huh?

721
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,880
Um, um,
yeah, all right.

722
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,320
Talking about it

723
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,560
before the third month
is bad luck.

724
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,480
Marty, look who's here!

725
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,480
[Marty]
Hey, look who's here!

726
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,800
Hey, guys,
what the hell?

727
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,440
Good to see you!
How you doing?

728
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,400
Hi.

729
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,840
When
are you due?

730
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,280
Oh, I'm not
pregnant.

731
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,200
You're not pregnant?
Yeah, right.

732
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,160
Huh?

733
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,840
What are you
doing

734
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,680
on the maternity
floor?

735
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,080
Are we on
the maternity floor?

736
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,840
Good grief.
We're completely lost.

737
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,160
Poor old Beck.

738
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,560
She had
some bad Chinese.

739
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,200
We're here to see
the gastrointestinal specialist.

740
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,400
What's his name?

741
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,880
His name?

742
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,160
Yeah.

743
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,080
I can probably
tell you

744
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,520
what floor he's on.

745
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,760
She volunteers here. I've sold
cars to almost every doctor.

746
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,200
Beck, what's his name?

747
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,120
It's Dr. something,
isn't it?

748
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,520
It's Doctor...

749
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,960
Ridiculous.

750
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,400
Excuse me.

751
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,840
Oh, gosh.
Thanks.

752
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,240
I didn't realize
I'd left it.

753
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,680
Thank you
very much.

754
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,680
You have
a small pussy.

755
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,720
What?

756
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,680
I found the little hairs
on the bag.

757
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,640
What?

758
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,080
You know, the... meow...

759
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,840
Oh, cat!

760
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,240
Yes, we have a cat.

761
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,120
Well, you must
get rid of it.

762
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,080
What?

763
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,520
Cats spread the disease.

764
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,920
Oh, yeah. Where
the small worms...

765
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,360
Yes.
Small worms.

766
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,880
In the poop.

767
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,000
Toxoplasmosis.

768
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,440
Toxoplasmosis.
Thank you.

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,360
Thank you both
very much,

770
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,680
but Skippy
is old and clean

771
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,600
and won't cause
any problem.

772
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,000
O.K. Well,
it is your choice...

773
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,920
the cat or the baby.

774
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,320
Sorry to bring you
that news.

775
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,000

776
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,440
Oh, congratulations,
guys.

777
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,920
I'm so excited!

778
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,360
Congratulations,
you guys.

779
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,320
Congratulations.

780
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,720
Wow. That's great.
Oh, your first.

781
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,680
Thanks.

782
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,600
Sorry about...

783
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,040
That's all right.

784
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,960
I've been
lied to before.

785
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,400
You're good at it.

786
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,160
We could use you
at the car lot.

787
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,640
[Gail]
It's so exciting!

788
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
[Marty]
We're happy for you.

789
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,120
How are you feeling?

790
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,040
I'm O.K.
A little tired.

791
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,480
Everybody
gets tired,

792
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,880
but the whole
thing is just

793
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,320
a life-changing
event.

794
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,240
I'll give
you my number.

795
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,160
We can go
baby shopping.

796
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,560
You've got to
get that book,

797
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,960
<i>What To Expect
When You're Expecting.</i>

798
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,280
And we've got videos of
all her births.

799
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,640
You've got to
film your first.

800
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,040
That's the best.
It's the bloodiest...

801
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,960
blood everywhere,
things shooting out,

802
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,840
people screaming, stuff getting
torn and sewed together.

803
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,960
It's like a good
World War II movie.

804
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,600
Will you keep
the car?

805
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,080
Yeah. It's fine now.

806
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,240
Cost a bit of money.

807
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,720
But it only seats
two people.

808
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,160
It always did.

809
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,560
But you're going to
have a baby.

810
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,920
You could never fit
a car seat in there.

811
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,320
Listen, stop down
by the lot.

812
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,760
I'll make you
a good deal.

813
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,280
All right?

814
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,880
Great.

815
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,160
Honey, we got to go.
Bad Chinese...

816
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,600
Buddy!

817
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,520
Come on, baby.
Let's roll.

818
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,960
See you guys.

819
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,280
O.K.

820
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,680
I hate him.
I loathe him.

821
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,880
He tried to
sell me a new car.

822
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,760
Can you believe that?
Tacky or what?

823
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,200
Yeah,
but he's right.

824
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,600
We're going to need
something bigger.

825
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,320
But you know how much
I love my car.

826
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,120
I've worked
hard for it.

827
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,560
What do you
suggest?

828
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,920
Tie the baby
to the hood like a deer?

829
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,080
Well, no, but maybe
you could get a car.

830
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,000
On my salary?
Come on.

831
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,920
Well, put it this way.

832
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,720
I'm not getting rid
of the car.

833
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,400
What about the cat?

834
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,920
Huh?

835
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,800
What, you believe
Dr. Zhivago in there?

836
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,480
The monkey doctor?

837
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,880
He's right.
I've read about it.

838
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,640
Cats can be dangerous
for a baby.

839
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,520
They can suffocate
the baby, claw the baby.

840
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,400
Skippy is 16.
He can barely move.

841
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,840
He's half-blind.

842
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
He's too weak
to suffocate anyone.

843
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,400
What about hygiene
in the kitchen?

844
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,600
You get cat hair
and cat saliva.

845
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,280
You said that this baby
wouldn't change our lives.

846
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,320
Now I have to sell my car
and get rid of my cat.

847
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,240
This is the second month,

848
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,640
and our lives
are practically unrecognizable!

849
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,040
I really appreciate
your asking us along.

850
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,920
I'm hoping this
will get Samuel excited

851
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,360
about having a baby.

852
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,800
Oh, yeah. Sure.

853
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,240
Yeah, 'cause, um,

854
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,680
if things
don't change,

855
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,080
I'm thinking
about leaving him.

856
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Sure you are.

857
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,880
I thought about leaving
Marty all the time,

858
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,280
but this
is his first time.

859
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,160
You've got to
give him a chance.

860
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,600
He's completely
uninvolved.

861
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,480
This whole baby thing
really scares him.

862
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,880
He's probably having
trouble facing it.

863
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,800
If you have a baby,

864
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,680
that means
he's got to grow up.

865
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,560
The baby's the fun part.
That's fun.

866
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,640
You know.
Look at all this stuff.

867
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,080
Ah, yeah! Whoo!

868
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,000
He's going to
love this.

869
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,160
You know you're
having a boy, right?

870
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,760
Yeah.

871
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,560
Gail took one of those
amnio tests, I suppose.

872
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,520
No.

873
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,960
How do you know?

874
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,360
I can tell
it's a boy

875
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,720
by the way she's
carrying it all in front.

876
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,600
They don't often
carry them at the back.

877
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,040
If it's a boy,

878
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,440
they carry them low
like this.

879
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,320
If it's a girl,
it's up like this.

880
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,240
Plus, there are
special ways

881
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,120
to ensure that it
will be a boy.

882
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,520
What do you mean,
special ways?

883
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,440
Well,
when we made love...

884
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,880
Yeah?

885
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,640
we used
special positions.

886
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,080
Oh, please.

887
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,960
That's an old wives' tale,
that stuff.

888
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,240
You'll see.

889
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,320
Sometimes I'm not sure
I want this baby.

890
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,720
Oh, Missy,
of course you do.

891
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,640
It's just
such a privilege.

892
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,080
There's hundreds
of women

893
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,880
who spend thousands
of dollars every day

894
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,240
trying to
get pregnant.

895
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,480
It's like our profound
biological right.

896
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,640
It's something men
can never experience.

897
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,440
It has to be
at the right time for you,

898
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,760
but really,
it's a miracle.

899
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,160
And then
when the baby comes,

900
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,120
there's moments
of sheer happiness.

901
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,160
Even if you're alone?

902
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,240
I know it's fashionable,
PC, all that,

903
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,120
to be a strong,
independent single mother,

904
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,520
and, uh,
I'm prepared for that.

905
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,480
I can do that,

906
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,360
but, um, I would
love this baby

907
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,720
to have a mother
and a father.

908
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,600
I would love to
have a family,

909
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,640
and I would love to
marry Samuel.

910
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,080
Um...

911
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,960
all he has to do is ask.

912
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,120
Oh, Missy.

913
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,120
Okey-dokey.
Huh huh huh.

914
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,000
O.K. Tell your mommy
if she loves you,

915
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,880
she'll buy you
the whole Arnie collection!

916
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,800
Thank you,
Arnie.

917
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,240
Who loves you,
girls?

918
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,120
- Arnie.
- Arnie.

919
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,600
Hey, fellas.

920
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,040
How about taking home

921
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,920
a new Arnie doll
for the kiddies?

922
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,360
No, thank you,
buddy.

923
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,800
Mister,
you'd look great

924
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,680
in my "Arnie Loves You"
t-shirt.

925
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,560
They come in
extra-extra-extra large.

926
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,000
No, thank you.

927
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,880
How about a new
"Arnie Loves You" video?

928
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,640
# Love is for
you and me #

929
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,200
No, thanks. O. K?

930
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,760
#We are one
big family ##

931
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,000
I'm not going to
buy your damn video!

932
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,240
But the kids
will love it.

933
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,120
My kids think
your show sucks.

934
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,120
Oh.

935
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,040
But thanks,
anyway.

936
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,920
Hey, no hard feelings,
O. K?

937
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,840
All right. Sorry.

938
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,760
That's O.K.
Huh huh huh.

939
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,160
So long.

940
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,120
[Man's Voice]
Eh, you cheap shit.

941
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,560
What did you say?

942
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,000
[Arnie Voice]
Huh?

943
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,880
Oh, gee. I didn't say
nothing, mister.

944
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,800
He didn't say
anything, Marty.

945
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,800
Bye-bye.
Arnie loves you.

946
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,840
[Man's Voice]
You penis-head.

947
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,280
I heard that!

948
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,600
[Arnie Voice]
Heard what?

949
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,200
I heard what you said!

950
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,000
He's pathetic.
Come on.

951
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,440
There's children around here,
for God's sake!

952
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,600
So long...

953
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,480
[Man's Voice]
you fat-ass pussy!

954
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,440
That's it!

955
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,560
No.

956
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,520
Yes!

957
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,520
[Arnie Voice]
Uh-oh.

958
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,320
[Samuel]
No. No. Arnie.

959
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,800
Come on,
you wiener.

960
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,960
Come on,
you bitch.

961
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,720
Here's one
for the queen.

962
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,240
Oh!

963
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,320
I'll get him, Sammy.

964
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,600
Hey, cut it out.

965
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,720
Oh, you hit
like a girl,

966
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,000
you flatulent
butt-head.

967
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,440
I'll take both
you wieners on.

968
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,280
You and that
pussy boyfriend!

969
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,200
Right, you bastard!

970
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,840
Who's the fat pussy
now, buddy?

971
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,200
Tell your sister
to let go of my tail,

972
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,640
you weak-wristed
Nancy boy!

973
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,480
Get off me,
you fat bastard!

974
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,240
I'll shove an "Arnie Loves You"
lunch box up your ass!

975
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,320
Marty!

976
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,440
Samuel!

977
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,320
Oh, you...
Hi, honey.

978
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,240
He is
such a jerk!

979
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,880
[Marty]
We're in trouble.

980
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,640
[Arnie Voice]
Run to Mommy.

981
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,360
I'll wipe the floor
with you.

982
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,040
Oh...

983
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,240
Wow! That's, uh...

984
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,480
that's quite a breakfast
you've got there.

985
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,000
Mm-hmm!

986
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,400
Wow, you, uh...

987
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,080
certainly got

Forget about Rebecca.

1317
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,880
How could you

1318
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,320
say that to me?

1319
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,760
You reminded me

1320
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,200
she's the most important

1321
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,920
thing in my life

1322
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,520
just weeks ago.

1323
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,480
I never said that.

1324
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,400
I never...
I never said that.

1325
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,840
You said it

1326
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,280
at the tennis court.

1327
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,960
Oh, yeah.

1328
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,560
So what if I did?

1329
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,520
That was then,
but it's over,

1330
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,920
and you've got to get
on with your life.

1331
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,360
Listen to this...

1332
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,800
Buy some
new clothes.

1333
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,440
I'm telling you,

1334
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,120
we'll learn
a new sport,

1335
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,600
I'll throw a party,

1336
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,000
and you'll meet
some new people.

1337
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,880
Come on.
We'll have some fun!

1338
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,680
I don't think so,
Sean.

1339
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,200
Start with a smile.

1340
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,800
Smile,
for heaven sakes.

1341
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,640
Well,
that's hideous,

1342
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,120
but... but...

1343
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,560
but, you know,

1344
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,480
that's... that's...
that's the idea.

1345
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,320
# Oh, darling #

1346
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,520
# I'm so lonely without you #

1347

# Can't sleep at night #

1348

#Always thinkin' about you #

1349
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,920
That's O.K.
There you go.

1350
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,680
# But if I had the chance #

1351
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,600
#To start all over #

1352
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,000
# I wouldn't be wishin' today #

1353
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,360
# On a four-leaf clover #

1354
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,520
#And leavin' would be
the last thing on my mind #

1355
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,640
# If I could turn back
the hands of time #

1356
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,440
Ohhhh!

1357
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,720
# Oh, baby #

1358
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,520
# If I could turn back

# Oh, darling #

1360
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,480
Aren't you a little
old for this?

1361
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,720
# I can't hold out much longer #

1362
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:44,160
You want an ambulance?
Watch your step.

1363
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,320
# But the pain
is getting deep #

1364
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,680
# Oh, the hurt
keeps getting stronger #

1365
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,040
# But if I had
just one more try #

1366
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,960
# I would be yours alone #

1367
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,000
# Until the day I die #

1368
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,600
#And we would have
a love so divine #

1369
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,640
# If I could turn back
the hands of time #

1374
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,240
# Remember, girl #

1375
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,680

01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,200
Do you want to dance?

1381
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,320
No, I...

1382
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,400
Come on.
Don't be a stiff!

1383

Thanks
for the ride home.

1396
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,920
Pleasure. Pleasure.

1397
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,440
Want to come up
for coffee?

1398
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,120
No. Thanks, no.
I'm just going to...

1399
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,520
shoot off.

1400
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,840
Oh.

1401
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,640
Do you want
to come up for sex?

1402
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,320
Wow. Ha ha ha!

1403
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,760
That's...
That's pretty...

1404
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,200
direct.

1405
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,560
Um...

1406
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,320
no. The thing is,
Lili, I think...

1407
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,760
you're incredibly
attractive,

1408
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,160
but I think it's
just a bit early

1409
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,240
for me
to get involved,

1410
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,160
so I'll take
a rain check.

1411
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,440
Another day.

1412
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,960
Arr, matey.

1413
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,240
Will ye be taking it
out to drive?

1414
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,200
[Marty]
If you travel,

1415
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,640
this holds a lot.

1416
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,960
You can put
a queen-size waterbed in back.

1417
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,480
Ever been
on a waterbed?

1418
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,920
Can I help you?

1419
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,840
Yeah, I'm looking
for Mr. Dwyer.

1420
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,400
He's right
over there.

1421
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,600
You never have
to worry about hemorrhoids.

1422
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,880
I'll be right back
with you.

1423
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,520
Just enjoy the car.

1424
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,480
Thanks for
coming down, man.

1425
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,800
I missed you.

1426
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,280
Thanks.

1427
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,680
Well, um... this is
very painful for me,

1428
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,560
but I want to buy
a new car.

1429
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,480
Buddy! Buddy,
it's about time.

1430
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,880
We happen
to have a few.

1431
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,120
How's Rebecca?

1432
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,240
She's great.

1433
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,840
You're taking
care of her?

1434
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,320
Gail's taking
her shopping,

1435
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,560
and they're
exercising.

1436
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,000
Then I make them
dinner every night.

1437
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,440
Right.
And she's O. K?

1438
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,840
Yeah. The first month,
she cried a lot,

1439
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,240
but she hasn't
mentioned you in two weeks.

1440
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,160
I think she's
getting over you.

1441
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,480
This is
the car for you.

1442
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,920
Listen, Marty,
I need to see her.

1443
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,840
She doesn't
want to see you.

1444
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,360
I really have to
speak to her, O. K?

1445
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,920
I want her back.

1446
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,200
That's going to take
a lot of convincing.

1447
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:28,680
Do something for me.

1448
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,080
Just, um... organize
a chance meeting.

1449
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,000
Bring her
to a grocery store

1450
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,000
or a restaurant,
and I'm there.

1451
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,120
I don't know.

1452
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,680
Ask Gail if I could
baby-sit your kids Saturday.

1453
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,640
You want to baby-sit
my kids?

1454
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,840
Yes! It's brilliant.

1455
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,960
It will convince Rebecca
that I like children.

1456
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,640
That will get me
in trouble with Gail,

1457
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,560
and you know
how mad she gets.

1458
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,960
Marty, please
do this for me!

1459
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,840
O.K., O.K.,
I will.

1460
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:56,920
Thanks! Excellent!

1461
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,880
Excellent!

1462
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,240
Excellent.

1463
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,680
Oh! There we go.

1464
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,600
This is fun,
isn't it?

1465
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:17,720
Yeah!

1466
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,800
Isn't this jolly,
Molly? Ha ha!

1467
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,240
Listen to this.

"I removed
the victims' brains

1470
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,000
Awesome, huh?

01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,600
Shannon, the other
children here

1472
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,840
don't want to hear
that beastly stuff,

1473
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,280
so just
read quietly.

1474
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,480
Higher!

1475
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,680
Yes. Higher.

1476
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,440
Now, Patsy, no.
That's not funny, my love.

1477
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,080
Don't strangle
the little boy.

1478
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,520
But he likes it!

1479
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,080
Say uncle!

1480
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,400
Just...
Yes, that's it.

1481
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,240
Hey, Sam! Sam!

1482
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:46,560
Oof!

1483
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,640
Shit.
Sam, are you O. K?

1484
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,320
Great. Fine.

1485
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,840
Are you all right?

1486
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,120
Yeah, yeah. Good.

1487
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,880
We're getting on
well here.

1488
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,280
Is Rebecca coming?

1489
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:58,600
No.

1490
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,080
No? Marty,
we had an agreement.

1491
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,720
She's
in the hospital, Sam.

1492
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,040
The hospital?

1493
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,960
Why? What's wrong?

1494
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,520
There might be a problem
with the pregnancy.

1495
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,120
What are you
talking about?

1496
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,000
The doctors don't know,
but she's with them.

1497
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,120
Jesus Christ.

1498
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,080
Be careful, Sam!

1499
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,360
Hi. Which room is
Rebecca Taylor in, please?

1500
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,480
615.

1501
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,600
Where's that?

1502
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,880
Just around
the corner.

1503
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:32,360
Gail!

1504
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,520
So?

1505
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,000
Will she be
all right?

1506
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:36,520
Yeah, she's
going to be fine.

1507
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,920
Oh!

1508
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,600
She just started
having some contractions,

1509
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,080
and she started dilating.

1510
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,000
They'll keep her overnight,
restrict her movement.

1511
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:47,040
It just sometimes happens
in the seventh month.

1512
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,640
And the baby's O. K?

1513
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:50,880
Yeah. Baby's great.

1514
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,080
So... can I see her?

1515
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,360
Don't upset her.

1516
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,960
I won't.

1517
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,400
Promise?

1518
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,640
Yep. Promise.

1519
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,720
O.K.

1520
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,200
Thanks.

1521
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,520
Hi.

1522
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,840
Hi.

1523
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,720
What are you
doing here?

1524
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,760
Well, you know I was
worried about...

1525
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,000
about you
and the baby.

1526
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,960
We're going to be fine.

1527
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,000
Yeah. That's
what Gail said.

1528
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,280
[Beeping]

1529
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,280
Is this...
is this noise...

1530
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,760
Is that the baby's
heartbeat?

1531
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,880
Yeah.

1532
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,640
Strong.

1533
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,040
Yeah.

1534
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,720
Beck, I'm sorry.

1535
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,400
I'm so sorry.

1536
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:12,040
I was, um...
a disgrace.

1537
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,800
I mean,
I know now exactly

1538
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,720
what a bastard
I was.

1539
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,640
I was... I was...
completely selfish,

1540
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,080
and you had
absolutely

1541
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,520
every right

1542
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:23,440
to walk out on me.

1543
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,720
But I just want
you to reconsider.

1544
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,080
Sam, please, no...

1545
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,560
Let me just explain.

1546
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,000
I think...

1547
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:34,840
<i>I know
that I've changed.</i>

1548
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,280
You don't believe
in change.

1549
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,240
I do now.
Change is great.

1550
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,160
Change is what
it's all about.

1551
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:43,560
Anyone who doesn't believe
in change is a coward,

1552
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,280
which is what I was.

1553
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:48,200
I was scared.
I was scared of...

1554
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:49,760
of losing control

1555
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,720
and of losing,
you know,

1556
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,600
you or what
we had together

1557
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,000
and losing my youth.

1558
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,520
Aren't you now?

1559
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,960
No. No, especially
not my youth.

1560
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,480
My youth is here,

1561
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,600
doing well.

1562
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,040
I'd really love
to believe this.

1563
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,480
Listen, I've seen

1564
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:10,920
the second
ultrasound...

1565
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,320
The one you left
at Dr. Thatcher's

1566
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,240
the day I was late.

1567
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,640
The point is,
I don't care

1568
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,040
what I think or
don't think anymore.

1569
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,440
I don't give
a damn about me.

1570
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,040
I'm in love
with my child.

1571
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,040
You are?

1572
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,200
And I'm completely in love
with you for having it.

1573
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,240
Samuel, you almost
ruined everything, and...

1574
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,200
Shh. Please.

1575
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,080
It's
the seventh month.

1576
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,040
The baby
can hear you.

1577
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,560
How do you know that?

1578
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,320
I've been
reading up...

1579
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,760
Dr. Brazelton,

1580
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,680
<i>What To Expect When
You're Expecting.</i>

1581
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,600
I've been
to a Lamaze class.

1582
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,960
I was the only
single father there.

1583
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,120
Really?

1584
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,720
And I sold
the Porsche.

1585
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,440
Oh, I don't believe that.

1586
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,720
Yep. Marty gave me
a terrible deal

1587
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,480
on a big family car.

1588
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:04,600
He did?

1589
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,040
Yes.
It's parked outside.

1590
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,960
Car seat,
family extras.

1591
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,320
It just needs
a family.

1592
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,680
And, um...

1593
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,880
there's this.

1594
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,120
Open it.

1595
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,960
Would you be my wife?

1596
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,640
Yes.

1597
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,840
Yes!

1598
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,760
On one condition.

1599
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,880
O.K.

1600
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,560
Lose the earring.

1601
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,920
#Wah-oh #

1602
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,360
It's gone.

1603
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,160
#Wah-oh-oh-oh #

1604
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,640
# Have I ever told you #

1605
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,640
# How good it feels
to hold you? #

1606
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:23,720
# It isn't easy
to explain #

1607
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:31,400
#And though I really
keep trying #

1608
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:35,720
# I think I may start crying #

1609
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,880
# My heart can't wait
another day #

1610
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:43,400
#When you kiss me,
I've just got to say #

1611
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,800
# Baby, I love you #

1612
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:47,400
# Come on, baby #

1613
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,600
# Baby, I love you #

1614
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:50,600
# Sweet baby #

1615
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,040
Ah!

1616
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,960
# Baby, I love you #

1617
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,400
# Come on, baby #

1618
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,800
# Baby, I love you #

1619
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,720
# Oo-wee, baby ##

1620
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,000
Thank you.

1621
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,440
I've always wanted

1622
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,360
to be carried
over a threshold.

1623
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,480
Unh.

1624
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,920
Are you all right?

1625
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,320
Yeah. I've got
something to show you.

1626
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,440
Yeah?

1627
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,000
Oh, Samuel.

1628
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,560
It's...

1629
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,920
It's beautiful.

1630
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,840
You did this
all by yourself?

1631
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,920
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

1632
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,120
Thank you.

1633
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,400
It's perfect.

1634
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,240
How are you feeling,
love?

1635
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,680
Oh, O.K.

1636
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,600
My feet are
really swollen.

1637
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,520
My back's killing me.

1638
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:04,960
Well, look.

1639
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,400
Leave this to me.

1640

Hi. Look, I'm sorry
to bother you.

1643
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,560
My wife's pregnant,
she's due in two weeks,

1644
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,280
and I was wondering...

Lili.

1646
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,920
Samuel. Oh.

1647
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,520
Hi. What a coincidence.

1648
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,120
How... How long... How long...

1649
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,360
How long have you
been working here?

1650
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,800
Three weeks.

1651
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,720
Three weeks.

Obviously.

1655
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,280
So listen, Lili,

1656
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,640
how long is the wait
for a table going to be?

1657
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,240
Give me
a few minutes.

1658
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,960
I'll seat you
right away.

1659

She's just setting
the table now.

1663
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,080
You know her?

1664
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,240
Who?

1665
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,600

I've never seen her
before in my life.

1669
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,040
She called you Samuel.

1670
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:16,320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1671
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,800
That's my name.

1672
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,160
Yeah, but you're
on a first-name basis

1673
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:22,360
with a woman you've
never seen before?

1674
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,640
Well, she took
my first name. See?

1675
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,400
Some places take
the first name.

1676
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,240
Some places,
they use last names.

1677
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,920
Here, they use
first names.

1678
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,880
Oh.

1679
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,000
You're silly.

1680
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,120
You're paranoid.

Hang on.
This is quite serious.

That needs stitches.

while we were apart?

1713
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,640
It was completely

completely faithful?

If it was innocent,

why did you lie
about knowing her?

1721

Because you were

01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,160
How are you?

1808
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,360
The baby's ready.

1809
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,960
What do you mean,
ready?

1810
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,240
To come out!

1811
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,680
Jesus Christ almighty,

1812
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,360
where is
the bloody doctor?

1813
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,200
Here I am.

1814
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,480
- Aah!
- Aah!

1815
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,880
Please don't do that.

1816
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:19,360
No. No.

1817
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:20,800
Hi. Where's Dr. Green?

1818
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,480
Where's our doctor?

1819
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,680
Miami.

1820
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,400
He's on vacation.
You are two weeks early.

1821
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,960
You're not the replacement
doctor, are you?

1822
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,120
Yes, I am.

1823
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,240
No. No.

1824
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,720
I want
someone else.

1825
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,040
There is nobody else.

1826
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,280
There must be!
Find me another doctor!

1827
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,600
There's no one else!
All right?

1828
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,120
It is a full moon.

1829
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,480
Everybody has gone into labor.
Look around!

1830
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,080
There are not enough
doctors and nurses.

1831
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,960
There are not
enough delivery rooms.

1832
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,560
Unless you want to deliver
this baby yourself,

1833
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:52,280
follow me!

1834
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,880
Ow!

1835
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,840
Oh, God! I'm O.K.

1836
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,800
I'm a little nervous,
O. K?

1837
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,720
It's my first delivery.

1838
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,680
If there aren't
any rooms,

1839
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,600
where is she
having the baby?

1840
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,520
I'll put her
with another patient.

1841
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,800
We're sharing a room?

1842
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,400
I'm sorry. We're a little
overbooked, O. K?

1843
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,680
Let's go. Let's go.

1844
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,920
Get this woman

1845
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,520
on the delivery table
immediately,

1846
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,720
if not later.

1847
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,920
Come on. Let's go.

1848
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,560
Where are you taking me?

1849
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:21,640
You're looking good.

1850
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,360
You're dilated
to 7 centimeters.

1851
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,760
How much is that?

1852
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,160
O. K? Got it?

1853
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,840
She's very good, O. K?

1854
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,240
You look uncomfortable.

1855
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,200
I'm going
to raise you down.

1856
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,880
No! Don't touch
anything!

1857
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,880
All right.
Get somebody over here!

1858
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,000
Hey, buddy.

1859
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,120
No!

1860
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,720
What are you doing here?

1861
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,000
I'm cruising
for chicks.

1862
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,480
I'm having a baby!

1863
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,280
Hi. Hi!

1864
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,280
How you feeling?

1865
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,360
Isn't this terrible,
just terrible?

1866
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,640
Sounds very good.

1867
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,920
Where's my husband?

1868
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,880
It's a full moon!

1869
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:53,480
Women are
spouting them out!

1870
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:54,880
Good.
Everybody's old friends.

1871
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,160
Back to work!

1872
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,320
Smile, Doc.

1873
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,520
How's she doing?

1874
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,160
Great.
God bless America, O. K?

1875
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:01,560
Ooh...

1876
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,000
Honey, smile for me.

1877
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:05,560
I love you. Smile.
You're so beautiful.

1878
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,200
It's not bad, is it?
It doesn't hurt.

1879
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,200
I want something
for the pain.

1880
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,120
O.K. I'll get you
something.

1881
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,560
Knock me out!

1882
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:17,080
Knock me ow-ow-ow...

1883
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,000
Give her something
for the pain!

1884
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,760
You don't want
natural childbirth?

1885
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:21,920
No!

1886
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,960
O.K.
You want Anastasia?

1887
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:24,920
What?

1888
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,040
Drugs, yes?

1889
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:27,000
Yes!

1890
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,840
Give me a moment.
I'm thinking.

1891
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,520
You mean
you don't know?

1892
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,480
Kind of.

1893
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,920
Think,
you Commie bastard!

1894
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,680
Shut up,
you Limey prick!

1895
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,960
Sorry.

1896
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,560
I can't take
the pressure.

1897
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,880
Don't yell at me.

1898
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,920
Yes. Yes. It's fine.

1899
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,040
Oh...

1900
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,480
Valium.

1901
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,120
Valium's
no good for her!

1902
01:22:45,200 --> 01:22:46,360
No, for me!

1903
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:47,320
No!

1904
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,440
I've got it!

1905
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,720
Oh, thank God!

1906
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,960
Nurse,
call the anesthesiologist.

1907
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,880
This woman needs an enema.

1908
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:54,840
An enema?

1909
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:55,840
- Enema?
- Enema?

1910
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,200
No. Uh...
she needs a pedicure!

1911
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:00,160
This ain't
no beauty parlor.

1912
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,320
Epitaph.

1913
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,400
She's not dead,
you moron!

1914
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,200
Epidermis?
What is it, Epilady?

1915
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,880
Epidural, asshole!

1916
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,560
That's right! Yes!
That's what I mean.

1917
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,600
Epidural.
Epidural.

1918
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,160
I always
get those confused...

1919
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:14,600
enema, pedicure, epidermal.

1920
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,440
I should buy myself
a clitoris.

1921
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,640
<i>A thesaurus.</i>

1922
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,760
You don't know
what a clitoris is.

1923
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,280
What are you doing?
Go away from here.

1924
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,400
I'm proud of you.
I love you.

1925
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,320
I hate you!

1926
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,840
You did this to me,

1927
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,720
you miserable piece of
dick-brained horseshit

1928
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,760
slime-sucking
son of a whore bitch!

1929
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,160
That's perfect,
sweetheart.

1930
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,720
The kids will love it.
I'll put it...

1931
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:40,840
Ooh!

1932
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,720
Get out! Get out!
You're the one!

1933
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,000
You are the one!

1934
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,600
Hi, everyone.
I'm Dr. Newsoe.

1935
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,520
I'm here to administer
the epidural.

1936
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,440
[Rebecca]
Oh, yes! Thank God!

1937
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,840
You inject that thing
into my wife?

1938
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,480
Mm-hmm.
Right into her spine.

1939
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,880
Mm-hmm. Good. Excellent.

1940
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:00,000
[Rebecca]
Whoa... hey!

1941
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,920
[Dr. Kosevich]
Look, you see?

1942
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,320
That is why women
have the babies...

1943
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,960
because men
can't handle the pa-aa...

1944
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,760
Hey, you guys!

1945
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:10,080
Get some smelling salts

1946
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,640
and get these men up
off the floor!

1947
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:14,880
[Rebecca]
Help me! Help me!

1948
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:19,200
I need some help.
I need some help.

1949
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:20,640
Oh!

1950
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,040
- Aah!
- Aah!

1951
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:23,640
No time
for an epidural.

1952
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:24,640
Why?

1953
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:25,920
No time, Doctor.

1954
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:28,600
I checked her cervix.
She's dilated to 10.

1955
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:31,960
Doctor, this woman
is also dilated to 10.

1956
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,280
Hi, everybody.
Smile big!

1957
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,840
Give me a smile.

1958
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,280
What are you doing?

1959
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,760
I'm making you a souvenir.
Isn't it great?

1960
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,640
Get that thing
off her face!

1961
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:42,200
Give it to me!

1962
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:45,120
No! I got a great shot
of the head!

1963
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,080
Asshole.

1964
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:48,680
You broke my camera.

1965
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,320
Ooh!

1966
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,080
Oh, Sam, I'm sorry.

1967
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,560
I got carried away.

1968
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,520
Bastard!

01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:32,920
She's a professional.

2136
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:34,360
She's better
than me.

2137
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,120
#This is a love #

2138
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,360
# For the one magician #

2139
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:42,520
#Turned the water #

2140
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:44,120
# Into wine #

2141
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:45,560
#All right... #

2142
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:08,200
#These are the days ##

2143
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:19,640
#Wah-oh, wah-oh-oh-oh #

2144
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:23,480
# Have I ever told you #

2145
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,920
# How good it feels #

2146
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,640
#To hold you? #

2147
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:31,720
# It isn't easy to explain #

2148
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:39,400
#Though I really keep trying #

2149
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:43,400
# I think I may start crying #

2150
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,840
# My heart can't wait #

2151
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:47,560
#Another day #

2152
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:49,000
#When you kiss me #

2153
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,080
# I've just got to say #

2154
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,480
# Baby, I love you #

2155
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,080
# Come on, baby #

2156
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:57,480
# Baby, I love you #

2157
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:59,240
# Oo-wee, baby #

2158
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:00,840
# Baby, I love you #

2159
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,240
# Baby,
I love only you #

2160
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:07,880
#Wah-oh,
wah-oh-oh-oh #

2161
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,400
# I can't live
without you #

2162
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:15,720
# I love everything
about you #

2163
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,720
# I can't help it
if I feel this way #

2164
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:27,680
# Oh, I'm so glad
I found you #

2165
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:31,520
# I want my arms
around you #

2166
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:36,320
# I love to hear you
call my name #

2167
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:39,200
# Oh, tell me
that you feel the same #

2168
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,600
# Baby, I love you #

2169
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:43,520
# Come on, baby #

2170
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,920
# Baby, I love you #

2171
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:47,360
# Sweet baby #

2172
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:49,760
# Baby, I love you #

2173
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,520
# Come on, baby #

2174
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,040
# Baby, I love you ##

2175
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:17,440
#This is the time
of your life #

2176
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,920
#What you going to do
with it? #

2177
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,120
# Don't fool with it #

2178
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:30,000
#This is the time
of your life #

2179
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:33,000
#You better face it #

2180
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:37,200
# Don't waste it #

2181
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,640
# Don't think
about the future #

2182
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,880
# Don't think
about the past #

2183
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,640
#There's just this moment #

2184
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:50,000
# Better make it last #

2185
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,040
# Now, you better
get it right #

2186
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:56,880
# 'Cause this is the time #

2187
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,800
# Of your life #

2188
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,440
# Oh, yeah #

2189
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:11,920
# Ooh #

2190
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,480
# I'm looking down
on the rooftops #

2191
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,000
#The changes are coming
too fast #

2192
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,600
# Don't have no answers #

2193
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:41,040
# Don't even know
what questions to ask #

2194
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:44,120
# I'm better off
saying nothing #

2195
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:47,520
#Than telling you lies #

2196
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,280
#Trying to ride out
the fire #

2197
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:53,400
#And a kiss good night #

2198
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,320
# I'm lost if I don't
see myself #

2199
01:36:56,360 --> 01:37:00,640
# In your eyes #

2200
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,920
# Oh #

2201
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,320

2203
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,000
# Don't fool with it #

2204
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:21,080
#Yeah, this is
the time of your life #

2205
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:24,320
#You better face it #
