Man's voice:
<i>SOLVING THE FOLLOWING RIDDLE</i>

3
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,788
<i>WILL REVEAL THE AWFUL SECRET</i>
<i>BEHIND THE UNIVERSE,</i>

4

<i>ASSUMING YOU DO NOT GO</i>
<i>UTTERLY MAD IN THE ATTEMPT.</i>

5

<i>SAY YOU HAVE AN AX-- JUST A</i>
<i>CHEAP ONE FROM HOME DEPOT.</i>

6
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:31,030

<i>DON'T WORRY--</i>
<i>THE MAN'S ALREADY DEAD.</i>

9
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,370
<i>MAYBE YOU SHOULD WORRY,</i>
<i>'CAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOT HIM.</i>

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,239
<i>HE'D BEEN</i>
<i>A BIG TWITCHY GUY</i>

<i>WITH VEINED SKIN</i>
<i>STRETCHED OVER SWOLLEN BICEPS,</i>

12
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,643
<i>TATTOO OF A SWASTIKA</i>
<i>ON HIS TONGUE.</i>

13
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,445
<i>AND YOU'RE CHOPPING OFF</i>
<i>HIS HEAD BECAUSE</i>

14
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:48,514
<i>EVEN WITH EIGHT</i>
<i>BULLET HOLES IN HIM,</i>

15
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,482
<i>YOU'RE PRETTY SURE HE'S ABOUT</i>
<i>TO SPRING BACK TO HIS FEET</i>

16
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,718
<i>AND EAT THE LOOK OF TERROR</i>
<i>RIGHT OFF YOUR FACE.</i>

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,120
<i>YOU NOW HAVE A BROKEN AX.</i>

18
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:58,490
- <i>SO YOU GO TO THE HARDWARE STORE...</i>
<i>- (bell jingles)</i>

19
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:03,228
<i>...EXPLAINING AWAY THE DARK REDDISH</i>
<i>STAINS ON THE HANDLE AS BARBEQUE SAUCE.</i>

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,498
- (rain pattering) - <i>THE REPAIRED AX
SITS UNDISTURBED IN YOUR HOUSE</i>

21

- <i>UNTIL THE NEXT SPRING WHEN
ONE RAINY MORNING... - (chittering)</i>

22
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:14,106
<i>SO YOU GRAB YOUR TRUSTY AX AND</i>
<i>CHOP THE THING INTO SEVERAL PIECES.</i>

23
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,341
- (clangs)
- <i>ON THE LAST BLOW, HOWEVER...</i>

24
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,445
<i>OF COURSE A CHIPPED HEAD MEANS YET</i>
<i>ANOTHER TRIP TO THE HARDWARE STORE.</i>

25
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,384
<i>AS SOON AS YOU GET HOME WITH</i>
<i>YOUR NEWLY-HEADED AX THOUGH...</i>

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,521
(groaning)

27
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:32,424
<i>YOU MEET THE REANIMATED BODY OF</i>
<i>THE GUY YOU BEHEADED LAST YEAR,</i>

28
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,594
<i>ONLY HE'S GOT A NEW HEAD</i>
<i>STITCHED ON WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE</i>

29
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,797
<i>PLASTIC WEED-TRIMMER LINE AND</i>
<i>WEARS THAT UNIQUE EXPRESSION</i>

30
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,266
<i>OF YOU'RE-THE-MAN-WHO-KILLED-</i>
<i>ME-LAST-WINTER RESENTMENT</i>

31
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,335
<i>THAT ONE SO RARELY ENCOUNTERS</i>
<i>IN EVERYDAY LIFE.</i>

32
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,170
<i>SO YOU BRANDISH YOUR AX.</i>

33
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:49,274
(raspy)
THAT'S THE AX THAT SLAYED ME.

34
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,778
Man's voice:
<i>IS HE RIGHT?</i>

35
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,314
<i>(dramatic music playing)</i>

36

(squeaking)

39
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,323
Man's voice:
<i>MY NAME IS DAVID WONG.</i>

40
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,559
<i>I ONCE SAW A MAN'S KIDNEY GROW TENTACLES,</i>

41
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,761
<i>TEAR ITSELF OUT OF A RAGGED HOLE IN HIS BACK</i>

42
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,796
<i>AND GO SLAPPING</i>
<i>ACROSS MY KITCHEN FLOOR.</i>

43
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,932
<i>BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.</i>

44
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,835
(inhales deeply, gasps)

45
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,238
<i>MORE SIDE EFFECTS.</i>

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,641
<i>IT'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS</i>
<i>WHEN I'M ON THE SAUCE.</i>

47
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,442
- <i>I DOSED SIX HOURS AGO.</i>
<i>- (plate clinks)</i>

48
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:03,215
<i>MY COUNT HAD 5,829 GRAINS</i>
<i>OF RICE ON HER PLATE.</i>

49
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,584
<i>THE RICE WAS GROWN IN ARKANSAS.</i>
<i>THE GUY WHO RAN</i>

50
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:07,719
<i>THE JOHN DEERE HARVESTER</i>
<i>WAS NICKNAMED COOTER.</i>

51
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,621
(squeaking)

52
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,426
<i>I'M NOT A GENIUS.</i>
<i>I'M NOT A PSYCHIC EITHER.</i>

53
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,228
<i>JUST SIDE EFFECTS,</i>
<i>THAT'S ALL.</i>

54
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,930
<i>(man's voice, distorted)</i>
<i>DAVID WONG?</i>

55
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,332
<i>(normal voice)</i>
<i>DAVID WONG?</i>

56
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,601
WHAT, DID YOU
DOZE OFF THERE?

57
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,971
HEY, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE ARNIE, RIGHT?

58
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,607
ARNIE BLONDESTONE.
SORRY I'M LATE.

59
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,243
YOU DON'T LOOK ASIAN,
MR. WONG.

60
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,846
I'M NOT.
I WAS BORN RIGHT HERE.

61
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,749
HAD MY LAST NAME CHANGED THOUGH.
THOUGHT IT'D MAKE ME HARDER TO FIND.

62
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,819
YOU KNOW THAT WONG IS THE MOST
COMMON SURNAME IN THE WORLD?

63
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,589
MMM. IS YOUR FAMILY
STILL AROUND?

64
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:46,925
NO, I WAS ADOPTED.
I NEVER KNEW MY REAL DAD.

65
00:03:46,927 --> 00:03:49,895
YOU COULD BE MY DAD
FOR ALL I KNOW.

66
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,698
ARE YOU MY DAD?

67
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,833
UH... (chuckles)

68
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,368
I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

69
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,271
ANYWAY, MY ADOPTED FAMILY
MOVED AWAY.

70
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,673
I WON'T TELL YOU
WHERE THEY WENT, BUT...

71
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,610
GET OUT YOUR PEN,
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA WANNA WRITE THIS DOWN.

72
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:07,813
<i>MY BIOLOGICAL MOM,</i>
<i>SHE WAS INSTITUTIONALIZED.</i>

73
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,448
MUST'VE BEEN HARD.

74
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,783
SHE WAS A STRUNG-OUT,
CRANK-ADDICTED CANNIBAL,

75
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,920
<i>DABBLED IN VAMPIRISM</i>
<i>AND NECROMANCY.</i>

76
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,623
BLEW HER WELFARE CHECK
EVERY MONTH ON BLACK CANDLES.

77
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,425
REALLY? AND I THOUGHT
MY MOM WAS BAD

78
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,928
BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T
LET ME WATCH "SPACE GHOST."

79
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,499
- YOU PULLING MY LEG?
- NO, THIS IS JUST WHAT I DO WHEN I GET NERVOUS.

80
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,569
UM, SHE WAS BIPOLAR,
THAT'S ALL.

81
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,405
<i>COULDN'T KEEP A HOUSE.</i>
<i>BUT ISN'T THE OTHER STORY BETTER THOUGH?</i>

82
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,008
- I THINK YOU SHOULD USE THAT.
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED

83
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,610
TO GET THE TRUTH OUT,
YOUR SIDE OF IT.

84
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,847
IF NOT, WHAT ARE WE EVEN
DOING HERE, MR. WONG?

85
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,384
YOU'RE RIGHT. SORRY.

86
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,952
SO YOU GUYS ARE--
YOU'RE WHAT?

87
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,289
YOU'RE SOME KIND
OF SPIRITUALISTS?

88
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,357
EXORCISTS?
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

89
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:55,494
Dave's voice:
<i>I COULD BLOW YOUR WORLD AWAY, ARNIE.</i>

90
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,629
<i>IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i>WHAT'S IN THIS CONTAINER,</i>

<i>YOU'LL NEVER FEEL AT ONE</i>
<i>WITH THE HUMAN RACE</i>

<i>UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE.</i>

93
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,635
<i>YOU EVER</i>
<i>SHIT YOURSELF, ARNIE?</i>

94
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,872
<i>'CAUSE YOU WOULD'VE IF</i>

Man on TV:
<i>He's a seeker of truth in an age of fear.</i>

97
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,418
- <i>(man #2 whispers) Marconi.</i>
<i>- Man: He is willing to face down</i>

98
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,521
- <i>the legions of evil.</i>
<i>- Man #2: Marconi.</i>

99
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,756
Man:
<i>He will help his fellow man</i>

100
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,359
<i>to find a path</i>
<i>into the light.</i>

101
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,760
Man #2: <i>Marconi.</i>

103

(beeps)

104
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,776
- HELLO?
- <i>Hey, this is John.</i>

105
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,446
<i>Your pimp says bring</i>
<i>the crack shipment tonight</i>

106
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,980
<i>or he'll be forced</i>
<i>to stick you.</i>

107
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,383
<i>Meet him where we buried</i>
<i>the Korean whore--</i>

108
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,385
<i>the one</i>
<i>without the goatee.</i>

109
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,487
David's voice:
<i>THAT WAS JOHN'S CODE.</i>

110
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,489
<i>IT MEANT "BRING YOUR GEAR</i>

<i>IT'S IMPORTANT."</i>

112
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,660
JOHN, IT'S 3:00
IN THE MORNING, MAN.

113
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,462
John:
<i>Oh, and don't forget--</i>

<i>tomorrow's the day</i>

- JOHN.

DAVE. COME IN.

120
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,107
DAVE, THIS IS SHELLY.
SHE NEEDS OUR HELP.

121
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:54,613
SO, SHELLY,
TELL US YOUR STORY.

122
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,482
IT'S MY BOYFRIEND.
HE WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE.

123
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,985
HE'S BEEN HARASSING ME
FOR THE PAST WEEK.

124
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,521
I'M TERRIFIED TO GO HOME.

125
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,423
- MISS...
- MORRIS.

126
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,024
MISS MORRIS,

127
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,059
I'D STRONGLY RECOMMEND
A WOMEN'S SHELTER.

128
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,995
<i>THEY CAN HELP YOU GET</i>

129
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,564
- <i>A RESTRAINING ORDER--</i>
<i>- MY BOYFRIEND...</i>

130
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,535
HAS BEEN DEAD
FOR TWO MONTHS.

131
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,976
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

132
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:27,612
I HEARD THROUGH A FRIEND
THAT YOU GUYS HANDLE...

133
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,848
UNUSUAL PROBLEMS.

134
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,484
SHELLY, WHEN HE COMES,
YOU CAN SEE HIM?

135
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:34,719
YES, AND I CAN HEAR HIM.

136
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,095
- HE HITS YOU?
- MAN, WHAT A DICK!

137
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,231
SHELLY, IN OUR EXPERIENCE,

138
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,667
SPIRITUAL BEINGS THAT
CAN MANIPULATE OBJECTS

139
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,802
IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD
ARE RARE.

140
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,206
UH, LOOK, MISS MORRIS,
I REALLY DON'T THINK--

141
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,241
I TOLD HER THAT WE'D
LOOK INTO THIS TONIGHT.

142
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,710
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE
YOU AND I COULD GO OVER THERE

143
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,912
AND SHOW THIS BASTARD
WHAT'S WHAT.

144
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,659

595
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:17,127
YOU WILL HEAR THAT WORD
AGAIN WITHIN 24 HOURS?

596
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:20,664
DO YOU EVER WONDER
WHY SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE

597
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:24,668
A SINGLE SHOE
LYING ALONGSIDE THE ROAD?

598
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,107
- (clicks)
- (woofs)

599
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:32,676
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU
FOR SOME TIME,

600
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:35,779
BUT THERE ARE GREAT GAPS
IN MY KNOWLEDGE.

601
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:40,684
DO YOU KNOW I OBSERVED A MAN
WHO MASTURBATED UNTIL HE BLED?

602
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,252
DID HE WANT TO DO THAT?

603
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,287
AND YOU,
WHEN YOU'RE ALONE--

604
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,089
- (grunts)
- (sizzling)

609
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,612
OKAY. OKAY.

610
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:12,182
THIS THING I GOT POINTED AT
YOU-- YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES?

611
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,219
I BELIEVE
I HAVE AN IDEA, YES.

612
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,789
AND ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THE OLD HUMAN SAYING

613
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:21,258
"I WANT TO SHOOT YOU SO BAD,
MY DICK'S HARD"?

614
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,494
I DON'T BELIEVE I DO.

615
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,797
MAYBE YOU'LL HEAR IT AGAIN
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS

616
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,565
IF YOU DON'T TRY
TO FUCK WITH ME.

617
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,803
NOW SHUT UP
AND DON'T MOVE.

618
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:34,438
(whimpers)

619
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,711

(stomping)

621
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,490
THINGS ARE
IN MOTION, HUH?

622
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,592
(Bark Lee barks)

623
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:03,166
- <i>HUH. NICE WORK, BARK LEE.</i>
<i>- (whimpers)</i>

625
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,312
Man: <i>DAVID WONG?</i>

626
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:20,150
- YEAH.
- DETECTIVE LAWRENCE APPLETON.

627
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,853
WOULD YOU PLEASE STEP OUT OF THE CAR?
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND?

628
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:26,456
HE'S... RESTING.

629
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,192
GET THE FUCK OUT
OF THE CAR.

630
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:36,666
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING DOWN, MR. WONG.

631
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,836
I BET IT'S BEEN QUITE
A NIGHT FOR YOU, HUH?

632
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,738
WHERE'S JOHN?

633
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,709
OH, HE'S FINE.
HE'S TALKING TO ANOTHER OFFICER

634
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:49,546
- <i>A FEW ROOMS FROM HERE.</i>
<i>- JOHN-- HE'S TALKING? REALLY?</i>

635
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:52,249
SINCE YOU'RE BOTH GONNA TELL
ME THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH,

636
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:54,618
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOUR STORIES MATCHING.

637
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,587
<i>DO YOU? JUST TELL ME</i>
<i>WHAT YOU DID LAST NIGHT.</i>

638
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,923
WELL, I WENT
TO A PARTY BY THE LAKE.

639
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,259
I LEFT AROUND MIDNIGHT.

640
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:03,927
I WAS ASLEEP BY 2:00.

641
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:06,229
OOH, YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

642
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,298
<i>YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T GO OVER</i>
<i>TO THE ONE BALL INN?</i>

643
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,301
YOU KNOW, ON GRAND AVENUE?
GRAB A NIGHTCAP?

644
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,936
YOUR BUDDIES
WERE ALL THERE.

645
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:16,273
NO, I HAD WORK IN THE MORNING.
I WENT STRAIGHT HOME.

646
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:19,476
David's voice: <i>AS I SPOKE,
A STRANGE JITTERY ENERGY</i>

<i>BEGAN TO RISE UP IN ME,</i>
<i>RADIATING FROM THE CHEST OUT.</i>

648
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:25,916
<i>AT THAT MOMENT,</i>
<i>THINGS BEGAN TO CLARIFY AND BECOME SIMPLE.</i>

649
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:29,419
<i>ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS STARTLED TO FIND</i>
<i>I COULD SEE THE COP'S NEXT QUESTION</i>

650
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:31,354
<i>BEFORE HE SPOKE IT--</i>
<i>WORD FOR WORD.</i>

651
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,823

<i>- HAVE YOU HEARD THE NAME</i>

652
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,693
(distorted) NATHAN CURRY?
A GUY ABOUT YOUR AGE.

653
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,663
<i>HIS PARENTS OWN A BODY SHOP</i>
<i>RIGHT HERE IN TOWN.</i>

654
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,965
- NO.
- David's voice: <i>"HOW ABOUT SHELBY WINDER?"</i>

655
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,334
HOW ABOUT SHELBY WINDER?

656
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,637
<i>HEAVY GIRL.</i>
<i>SENIOR AT EAST SIDE HIGH.</i>

657
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,473
- <i>JUSTIN WHITE?</i>
<i>- NO, SORRY.</i>

658
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:54,344
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- David's voice: <i>EVERYTHING WAS OBVIOUS NOW.</i>

659
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,379
<i>ALL THE WALLS OF THE MAZE</i>
<i>TURNED TO GLASS.</i>

660
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,315
<i>I IMMEDIATELY KNEW</i>
<i>TWO THINGS:</i>

661
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:00,717
<i>THIS LIST OF PEOPLE HAD ALL</i>
<i>BEEN AT THE PARTY LAST NIGHT</i>

662
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,919
<i>AND THEY WERE ALL NOW DEAD</i>
<i>OR HEADING THERE.</i>

663
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:06,256
<i>HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?</i>
<i>HOW DO YOU KNOW ANY OF THIS?</i>

664
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,792
<i>MAGIC?</i>
<i>YOU KNOW DAMN WELL WHY.</i>

665
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:11,428
<i>THAT BLACK SHIT JOHN TOOK</i>
<i>MADE BLOOD CONTACT WITH YOU.</i>

- <i>NOW YOU'RE GETTING HIGH, PARTNER,</i>

<i>ON THE SOY SAUCE.</i>
<i>IT'S GOT YOU.</i>

668
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,936
AT LEAST NINE PEOPLE
AT THE ONE BALL INN

669
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,272
AT CLOSING TIME
12 HOURS AGO...

670
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,808
THREE ARE MISSING.
YOUR FRIEND IS HERE.

671
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,977
THE REST ARE DEAD.

672
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:29,913
<i>YOUR FRIEND IS</i>

<i>OF THE ONE BALL NINE.</i>

674
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,618
AND NOW DON'T TAKE
OFFENSE AT THIS--

675
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,754
BUT HE'S NOT LOOKING
TOO HEALTHY RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

676
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,823
DID HE SAY ANYTHING
THIS MORNING?

677
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,925
JOHN CALLED ME LAST NIGHT,
TALKING CRAZY--

678
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:45,528
PARANOIA, HALLUCINATIONS,
THE WHOLE MONSTERS-IN- HIS-APARTMENT BIT.

679
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,831
SAID HE COULDN'T REMEMBER HOW
HE GOT WHERE HE WAS LIKE THAT.

680
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,966
DID HE SAY WHAT HE WAS ON?

681
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,402
NO.

682
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:54,337
YOU KNOW WE'LL
FIND OUT ANYWAY, RIGHT?

683
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:56,039
<i>I'M NOT INTERESTED</i>

<i>FOR POPPING PILLS.</i>

685
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,344
TO SOMEBODY LIKE ME,
DEAD BODIES ARE WHAT MATTERS.

686
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:04,347
NOW IF SOMEBODY IS OUT THERE
SELLING POISON--

687
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,349
I WOULD TELL YOU IF I KNEW.

688
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,554
SO WHAT, THAT'S HOW
EVERYONE DIED?

689
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,323
OVERDOSE?

690
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,662
WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY?
YOU KNOW HIM?

691
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:20,430
<i>YEAH, HE WAS THERE.</i>
<i>(taps)</i>

692
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,866
WHATEVER JOHN HAD,
HE GOT IT FROM THIS GUY.

693
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:25,969
THAT'S BRUCE MATTHEWS.
HE RUNS AN AMATEUR

694
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,405
UNLICENSED
PHARMACEUTICAL OPERATION

695
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,974
ON THE CORNER
OF 30th AND LEXINGTON.

696
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,642

697
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:33,843
BEFORE.

698
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,546
AFTER.

699
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,521
WHAT COULD EVEN
DO THAT TO A PERSON?

700
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:46,690
LIKE A BOMB
OR SOME KIND OF--

701
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:49,326
NOTHING YOU'D KNOW HOW TO DO.
I'M SURE OF THAT.

702
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:53,029
MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING NOT WITHIN
THE BOUNDS OF OUR FAMILIARITY.

703
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,964
WHAT I--

704
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,400
(whispers) SIR,
WE NEED YOU IN THE OTHER ROOM NOW.

705
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,607
HEY, WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

706
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,509

708
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,488

SO, UH...

712
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:29,065
BLACK STUFF--
THIS SOY SAUCE.

713
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,067
THAT'S A DRUG, RIGHT?

714
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,837
- OH, I'LL GET TO THAT.
- IT MAKES YOU SMARTER WHEN YOU TAKE IT.

715
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,772
IT LETS YOU READ MINDS
AND ALL THAT.

716
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:39,676
IT HEIGHTENS YOUR SENSES,
I THINK.

717
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:43,546
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S LIKE-- WHEN YOU'RE ON IT,
IT'S LIKE OVERLOAD.

718
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,548
<i>LIKE IF YOU HOOKED</i>

AND YOU'VE STILL GOT
SOME OF THIS STUFF?

723

YEAH, I TOOK SOME TODAY.

728
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:15,712
- IT'S FADING THOUGH.
- THE EFFECTS DON'T LAST THAT LONG?

729
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:17,580
THE SIDE EFFECTS
DON'T LAST THAT LONG.

730
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,817

OKAY, SO IF
I CONTACT THIS...

00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,751
I THINK YOU'VE GOT
A BOOK HERE,

744
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,786
PROBABLY, IF YOU FLESH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT.

745
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,922
A BOOK?

746
00:40:58,924 --> 00:41:02,025
MEANING A WORK OF FICTION?
MEANING IT'S ALL BULLSHIT?

747
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:04,494
HEY, A STORY'S A STORY.

748
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,062
I'M JUST
A FEATURE REPORTER,

749
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:09,732
SO THE FACT THAT YOU THINK
IT HAPPENED IS MY STORY.

750
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:13,837
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REMEMBER LEAVING
THE HOUSE WITH ANY COINS IN MY POCKET.

751
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,572
I THINK YOU COULD'VE
SLIPPED THEM TO ME.

752
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,040
WITHOUT YOU FEELING IT?

753
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:20,043
AND THE THING WITH THE DREAM?
COME ON, ARNIE.

754
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:22,078
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO BE ONE OF THOSE--

755
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,082
(laughs) ONE OF THOSE MENTALISTS,
LIKE THAT DR. MARCONI ON TV.

756
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:29,652
(scoffs) DR.
MARCONI MAY BE THEATRICAL,

757
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,755
BUT BELIEVE ME,
HE'S NOT AN ACT.

758
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,924
WELL, I CAUGHT
MARCONI'S ACT IN VEGAS,

759
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:38,061
AND YOUR STORY SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF
THE SAME KIND OF HOCUS-POCUS TO ME.

760
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,502
COME WITH ME.
I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

761
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:48,638
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?
- JUST OUT TO MY TRUCK.

762
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,510
- <i>(curtain rattles)</i>
<i>- ALL RIGHT.</i>

764
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,748
- <i>(distant barking)</i>
<i>- YOU SEE IT?</i>

765
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:03,987
NO. OR, YOU KNOW,
IT'S AN EMPTY CAGE.

766
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,789
TURN YOUR HEAD
SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME.

767
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:09,726
YUP. (sighs)

768
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:12,929
NOW YOU SHOULD SEE THE BOX JUST
OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE.

769
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:15,164
LET'S GO BACK INSIDE.
YOUR STORY WAS MORE INTERESTING.

770
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:18,101
YOU'RE GONNA DIE, ARNIE.
SOMEDAY YOU WILL FACE THAT MOMENT.

771
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:21,070
AND AT THAT MOMENT YOU WILL FACE
EITHER COMPLETE NONEXISTENCE

772
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:23,973
OR YOU WILL FACE
SOMETHING EVEN STRANGER.

773
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:26,743
ON AN ACTUAL DAY
IN THE FUTURE, ARNIE,

774
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:29,245
YOU WILL BE
IN THE UNIMAGINABLE.

775
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,081
IT IS PHYSICALLY
IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID IT.

776
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,784
THINK ABOUT THAT.
NOW,

777
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,053
WITHOUT TURNING
YOUR HEAD,

778
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:39,122
LOOK AT THE BOX.

779
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:45,562
(screeching)

780
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,730
AH! SHIT!

782
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,167
OH SHIT SHIT!

783

WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?

THERE'S NO NAME
FOR IT IN THIS WORLD.

790
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:06,249
IT'S PRETTY FREAKY
THOUGH, RIGHT?

791
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,884
WAIT. NO NO NO NO. YOU--

792
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:10,153
YOU MADE ME SEE SOMETHING.

793
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:11,988
YOU MADE ME SEE SOMETHING
OUT OF MY OWN HEAD.

794
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,691
YOU FREAKED ME OUT SO THAT
I WOULD SEE SOMETHING.

795
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:16,025
<i>NO, IT'S REALLY THERE.</i>

796
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:18,227
I'M SURPRISED YOU SAW IT
SO EASILY THOUGH.

797
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:20,263
YOU MUST HAVE
AN OPEN MIND.

798
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:23,333
MOST PEOPLE ONLY SEE IT THAT
FAST IF THEY'RE STONED OR DRUNK.

799
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:26,002
(chuckles)

800
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,071
I WANT TO TELL THE REST

I NEED TO.
I NEED TO GET IT OUT.

802

BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT

803

- THE TRUTH.
- OKAY.

804

IT OUT FOR REAL.

805

806
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:46,756
OKAY.

807
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:48,091

YOUR FRIEND...

HE'S DEAD.

- (panting)
- CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN.

816
00:44:07,212 --> 00:44:10,380
HE WENT INTO CONVULSIONS OR SOMETHING.
HIS PULSE STOPPED.

817
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:13,182
WE'VE GOT AMBULANCES.
ONE WILL BE HERE IN 30 SECONDS.

TELL ME THE TRUTH.

AND IF YOU OBSTRUCT ME
IN ANY WAY,

- <i>The only reason that you can hear me</i>

897
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:38,047
<i>is because you have some of the Soy</i>

But it's not very much and it's

YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK STUFF IS BOTH

1039
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:11,186
REAL AND NOT REAL
AT THE SAME TIME.

1040
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,490
<i>I'M NOT A STAR TREK FAN.</i>

1041
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:17,826
<i>I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT</i>
<i>OTHER DIMENSIONS AND ALL THAT.</i>

1042
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,928
I'M AN OLD SCHOOL CATHOLIC.

1043
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,797
I BELIEVE IN HELL.

1044
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:24,199
<i>I BELIEVE THAT</i>
<i>IT'S MORE THAN JUST</i>

1045
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:26,635
<i>MURDERERS AND RAPISTS</i>
<i>DOWN THERE.</i>

1046
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:29,271
I BELIEVE IN DEMONS
AND WORMS--

1047
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:33,175
VILE SHIT IN THE GREASE TRAP
OF THE UNIVERSE.

1048
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:35,511
AND THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,
THE MORE I THINK

1049
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:37,646
THAT IT'S NOT JUST
SOMEPLACE DOWN THERE.

1050
00:58:37,648 --> 00:58:39,581
OH NO, THAT IT'S
RIGHT HERE WITH US.

1051
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,250
WE JUST CAN'T PERCEIVE IT.

1052
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:44,219
IT'S KINDA LIKE THE COUNTRY
MUSIC RADIO STATION.

1053
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:47,089
IT'S OUT THERE
IN THE AIR

1054
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:50,158
EVEN IF YOU DON'T
TUNE INTO IT.

1055
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,794
<i>AND I THINK THAT SOMEHOW</i>

<i>OR MAGIC OR VOODOO--</i>

1057
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,699
THAT JAMAICAN
SON OF A BITCH,

1058
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,768
HE TUNED IN TO IT,

1059

<i>INTO HELL ITSELF.</i>

1060
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,705
THROUGH THAT,
HE OPENED A DOOR.

1061
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:06,041
HE BECAME THE DOOR.

1062
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,276

1063
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:10,879

YOUR SECOND QUESTION
ANSWERS YOUR FIRST.

1087

John: <i>Here's what I know:</i>

<i>Justin White-- or that thing</i>

<i>Justin's gonna hatch</i>

<i>the Soy Sauce.</i>

YOUR WORLD, YOU SEE,
IS A TWIN TO OUR OWN,

1342
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:41,048
DUAL OFFSPRING
BORN OF THE SAME LITTER.

1343
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,451
WATCH!
UP UNTIL THIS POINT,

1344
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:46,020
<i>OUR HISTORIES WERE IDENTICAL.</i>

1345
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:49,290
THERE WAS A MAN NAMED
CYRUS ROONEY FROM TENNESSEE.

1346
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:52,393
<i>IN YOUR WORLD,</i>
<i>HE DIED AT THE AGE OF 17,</i>

1347
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:57,798
GORED TO DEATH WHILE TRYING TO

<i>IN OUR WORLD,</i>
<i>THE MAN SURVIVED.</i>

1349
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:03,170
<i>HERE, CYRUS ROONEY WAS</i>
<i>A GENIUS.</i>

1350
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:07,775
HE CONTINUED TO EXPERIMENT
IN WHAT HE CALLED BEASTIOLOGY.

1351
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:11,412
YES. PEOPLE FROM OUR SOUTH
ARE INTO THAT AS WELL.

1352
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:14,048
- (chuckles)
- YOU SEE, BY 1881

1353
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:16,951
HIS GROUP HAD
INSECTILE FLYING MACHINES.

1354
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:21,789
IN 1902 HE CREATED THE FIRST
PRIMITIVE THINKING MACHINE

1355
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:23,991
OUT OF THE BRAIN
OF A PIG.

1356

(snorting)

1357
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:32,767
YOU SEE,
BY YOUR YEAR 1922

1358
01:19:32,769 --> 01:19:34,435
<i>WE ALREADY HAD</i>
<i>SELF-FEEDING,</i>

1359

<i>SELF-HEALING,</i>
<i>SELF-MODIFYING COMPUTERS.</i>

1360
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,809
IN 1926
MR. ROONEY PASSED AWAY.

1361
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:44,078
AND THEN SOMETHING
MIRACULOUS HAPPENED

1362
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,014
TO THE GREATEST
OF HIS CREATIONS.

1363
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:50,284
<i>THE VERY DAY MR. ROONEY PASSED,</i>
<i>IT BECAME SENTIENT.</i>

1364
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:52,520
<i>IT GAVE A NAME</i>
<i>UNTO ITSELF</i>

1365
01:19:52,522 --> 01:19:55,122
AND EXPRESSED
DESIRES AND EMOTIONS.

1366
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:59,260
AND FROM THAT DAY FORWARD, THIS ASTONISHING
CREATURE CARRIED ON ROONEY'S WORK

1367
01:19:59,262 --> 01:20:01,462
AND CONFORMED
ALL LIVING NATURE

1368
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:04,498
TO URGE ON THE ADVANCEMENT
OF MANKIND.

1369
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,901
FOR SOME,
THIS PROCESS WAS EASY.

1370
01:20:06,903 --> 01:20:09,170
OTHERS REQUIRED
RE-EDUCATION.

1371
01:20:09,172 --> 01:20:10,971

01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,385
Arnie:
<i>SO MARCONI SAVED THE DAY.</i>

1490
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:07,421
<i>HUH.</i>

1491
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:09,556
- KORROK STILL EXISTS?
- FROM OUR WORLD,

1492
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,425
IT'S HARD TO REALLY
KNOW FOR SURE.

1493
01:27:11,427 --> 01:27:13,427
BUT IT'S NO SECRET
THAT THERE'S

1494
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:15,562
STILL STRANGE STUFF
GOING DOWN IN THIS TOWN.

1495
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:17,998
WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL, AMY?
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

1496
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,434
AMY WASN'T TOO HAPPY
ABOUT HER DOG.

1497
01:27:20,436 --> 01:27:23,337
THE SOY SAUCE THAT THE
DOG INGESTED WHEN HE BIT

1498
01:27:23,339 --> 01:27:26,406
THE JAMAICAN GUY ALLOWED BARK
LEE TO PSYCHICALLY CONNECT

1499
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:27,608
<i>WITH NORTH AND MARCONI.</i>

1500
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:30,010
SO THE DOG KNEW
WHAT HAD TO BE DONE

1501
01:27:30,012 --> 01:27:33,413
<i>AND WAS WILLING TO MAKE</i>
<i>THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.</i>

1502
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:35,816
AS TO AMY...

1503
01:27:35,818 --> 01:27:38,452
<i>SHE'S BEEN MY GIRLFRIEND</i>
<i>EVER SINCE.</i>

1504
01:27:38,454 --> 01:27:40,520
<i>(birds chirping)</i>

1505
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:48,695
<i>I GOT HER OUT</i>
<i>OF TOWN THOUGH.</i>

1506
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:50,297
SHE'S UPSTATE AT COLLEGE.

1507
01:27:50,299 --> 01:27:52,633
GOT A 3.7 G.P.A.

1508
01:27:52,635 --> 01:27:54,468
GOOD FOR HER.
AND JOHN?

1509
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:57,638
WHAT, UH-- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
HE SURVIVED TOO?

1510
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,673
WE SHOOT HOOPS A LOT--

1511
01:27:59,675 --> 01:28:02,776
WHENEVER WE'RE NOT
TOO BUSY WITH, UH, WORK.

1512
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,348
WHAT THE HELL, MR. WONG.

1513
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:10,450
I SAY WE JUST
GO PUBLIC WITH IT,

1514
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:12,386
WITH YOUR STORY.

1515
01:28:12,388 --> 01:28:15,289
BUT JUST TELLING OUR STORY,
THAT'S NOT GOING TO DO SHIT.

1516
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,457
THE TESTIMONY
OF TWO NUTJOBS--

1517
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:20,060
THAT'S JUST GOING TO GET US LUMPED
IN WITH ALL THE ROSWELL LOSERS.

1518
01:28:20,062 --> 01:28:22,496
AH, I SEE. OKAY.

1519
01:28:22,498 --> 01:28:24,398
SO WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

1520
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,999
WE SHOW THEM THIS--

1521
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:28,068
A PHYSICAL PIECE
OF EVIDENCE.

1522
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:31,305
I'M THINKING IF YOU CAN GET
THIS IN THE HANDS OF SOMEONE,

1523
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:32,839
<i>LIKE A--</i>
<i>LIKE A LAB OR SOMETHING.</i>

1524
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:34,675
YEAH. YEAH.

1525
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:37,544
SOMEONE WITH
AN ELECTRON MICROSCOPE.

1526
01:28:37,546 --> 01:28:39,546
RIGHT? (laughs)
'CAUSE I'M THINKING

1527
01:28:39,548 --> 01:28:42,783
WHOEVER TAKES THE FIRST
CLOSE LOOK AT YOUR SOY SAUCE

1528
01:28:42,785 --> 01:28:44,551
IS GONNA HAVE
A BROWN STAIN DOWN

1529
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:46,820
THE BOTTOM OF HIS LAB COAT
A <i>SECOND</i>LATER.

1530
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,089
YES!
MAKE THAT THE STORY.

1531
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:51,091
HELL, LET 'EM SEE
THE EFFECTS THEMSELVES.

1532
01:28:51,093 --> 01:28:53,927
JUST FEED THAT SHIT TO A LAB
RAT AND WATCH THE FUN BEGIN--

1533
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:57,831
WATCH THAT THING START
LEVITATING AND SPEAKING FRENCH!

1534
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:01,001
AND YOU'RE-- YOU'RE WILLING TO RISK
EVERYTHING? YOUR LIFE, YOUR FAMILY?

1535
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:02,769
BECAUSE, I MEAN,
BEST CASE SCENARIO,

1536
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:04,671
YOUR CAREER AS A JOURNALIST
IS GONNA BE OVER

1537
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,740
BECAUSE THIS IS ALL ANYONE'S
EVER GONNA REMEMBER YOU FOR.

1538
01:29:06,742 --> 01:29:09,676
AND DON'T FORGET THAT THERE
MAY BE PEOPLE OUT THERE--

1539
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,579
REAL PEOPLE--
WHO DON'T WANT THIS OUT.

1540
01:29:12,581 --> 01:29:15,415
OH SHIT.
COME ON, WONG.

1541
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:18,685
I'VE BEEN AROUND.
WONG, I'VE BEEN AROUND.

1542
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,421
MY FIRST YEAR OUT
OF JOURNALISM SCHOOL,

1543
01:29:21,423 --> 01:29:24,758
I GOT KNOCKED COLD COVERING DEVIL'S
NIGHT FOR THE "DETROIT TRIBUNE."

1544
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,927
<i>THAT WAS 1984.</i>

1545
01:29:26,929 --> 01:29:29,629
I WOKE UP WITH MY CAMERA
BUSTED ON THE PAVEMENT,

1546
01:29:29,631 --> 01:29:31,598
BLOOD RUNNING
DOWN MY SHIRT,

1547
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,567
A BIG FAT COP
STANDING OVER ME

1548
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:35,469
AND HE SAYS,
"STAY DOWN, NIGGER."

1549
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:39,439
SO I THINK I KNEW THEN
WHAT I WAS DOING THIS JOB FOR,

1550
01:29:39,441 --> 01:29:41,007
AND IN THE YEARS SINCE--

1551
01:29:41,009 --> 01:29:42,442
<i>WHAT?</i>

1552
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,413
WHAT, WONG?

1553
01:29:46,415 --> 01:29:48,615
THEY, UH--

1554
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:51,385
THEY CALLED YOU
THE N-WORD?

1555
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,155
WHY ON EARTH
WOULD THEY DO THAT?

1556
01:29:55,157 --> 01:29:57,724
WHAT? IS THAT
SOME KIND OF JOKE?

1557
01:29:57,726 --> 01:30:01,528
(laughing)

1558
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:03,463
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?

1559
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:10,737
- OH MY GOD.
- HEY! HEY!

1560
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,039
HEY, ASSHOLE,
ANSWER ME!

1561
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:14,608
- OW.
- WHAT?!

1562
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:16,777
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

1563
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:19,679
DESCRIBE YOURSELF TO ME,
ARNIE-- PHYSICALLY.

1564
01:30:19,681 --> 01:30:23,784
- TELL ME WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.
- OH, NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.

1565
01:30:23,786 --> 01:30:26,153
YOU'RE FUCKING WITH ME.

1566
01:30:26,155 --> 01:30:28,655
'CAUSE TO ME
YOU'RE NOT BLACK, ARNIE.

1567
01:30:28,657 --> 01:30:32,559
TO ME YOU'RE A SLOPPY
WHITE GUY

1568
01:30:32,561 --> 01:30:35,162
IN A RUMPLED CORDUROY JACKET
WITH A TAPE RECORDER.

1569

1573
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:01,221
COME ON, ARNIE.
(sighs)

1574
01:31:01,223 --> 01:31:04,991
OPEN IT. THE SOONER YOU DO,
THE SOONER WE CAN MOVE ON.

(gasps, breathes heavily)

01:31:13,234 --> 01:31:16,770
I'M SORRY, ARNIE.
I REALLY AM.

1577
01:31:16,772 --> 01:31:18,672
YOU DID THIS TO ME.

1578

THAT YOU HAD CONTACTED ME

I'M REALLY SORRY

I'M NOT A FUCKING GHOST.

1639
01:34:44,111 --> 01:34:46,212
(chittering)

1640
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:50,150

I AM SERGEANT VANCE McELROY
OF THE HUMAN LIBERATION ARMY.

1644
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:18,078
PROPHECY HAS FORETOLD THE COMING
OF STRANGERS FROM ANOTHER WORLD.

1645
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,180
<i>IT IS AN HONOR</i>
<i>TO MEET YOU.</i>

1646
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:23,783
<i>I MUST CONFESS I DO NOT KNOW</i>
<i>FROM WHERE YOU CAME,</i>

1647
01:35:23,785 --> 01:35:25,318
BUT I CAN TELL
BY LOOKING AT YOU

1648
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:28,088
THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN INFECTED
WITH THE GREAT DISEASE.

1649
01:35:28,090 --> 01:35:30,190
<i>I ASSUME WE SHARE</i>
<i>A COMMON ENEMY.</i>

1650
01:35:30,192 --> 01:35:33,793
IF YOU CANNOT DEFEAT HIM,
THEN ALL HOPE FOR MANKIND WILL BE LOST.

1651
01:35:33,795 --> 01:35:36,930
<i>GENTLEMEN, THE WINDS OF DESTINY</i>
<i>HAVE BLOWN US TOGETHER.</i>

1652
01:35:36,932 --> 01:35:40,867
A BRIGHT DAWN IS ABOUT TO MARK
THIS LOST AND BROKEN WORLD.

1654
01:35:43,939 --> 01:35:46,072
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING,

1655
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,108
BUT TO PERFORM THIS TASK

1656
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:50,944
WE'LL NEED A NUMBER
OF ITEMS FROM OUR WORLD.

1657
01:35:50,946 --> 01:35:53,279
SO YOU MUST
LET US RETURN THERE

1658
01:35:53,281 --> 01:35:57,183
AND COME BACK
TO BEGIN OUR QUEST.

1659
01:35:57,185 --> 01:36:00,386
IT IS GOOD THEN.
WE SHALL AWAIT YOUR RETURN.

1660
01:36:00,388 --> 01:36:03,289
BUT AS YOU DEPART, KNOW THAT
WE OF THE H.L.A. RESISTANCE

1661
01:36:03,291 --> 01:36:05,792
WILL ALWAYS AND FOREVER BE IN YOUR DEBT,

1662
01:36:05,794 --> 01:36:08,528
<i>FOR BOTH OF YOU MARK</i>
<i>ALL THAT IS GOOD AND PROMISING.</i>
