- Captain.
- No!

163
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,051
I see Leonidas is molding
our future king of Sparta...

to be a man.

I remember when
my father used to beat me.

Traditional rites of passage.

168
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:12,029
No. My father was an alcoholic.

169
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,538
(paint gun firing,
pellets ricocheting)

170
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:14,402
Ow!

171
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:16,366
Aah!

172
00:08:18,311 --> 00:08:20,108
Xerxes' messenger awaits, my king.

173
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,772
(exhales)

174
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,008
(gun fires)

175
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,720
Greetings, Leonidas.

176
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:31,416
Greetings, messenger.

177
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,516
(loud kiss)

178
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:36,061
(spitting): What the hell was that?

179
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:37,061
What?

180
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,222
You just kissed me!

181
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:41,290
That is how men of Sparta
greet one another.

182
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,767
High fives for the women...

183
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,635
and open-mouth tongue
kisses for the men.

184
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:56,979
Ooh.

185
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,415
I get it.

186
00:08:58,484 --> 00:08:59,473
Get what?

187
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:02,146
Uh... y-you have a...

188
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:04,053
"free society" here.

189
00:09:04,123 --> 00:09:06,284
Yes. The freest.

190
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,088
Uh, not that there's
anything wrong with that.

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
(whispers): I dig big black dudes.

192
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,069
Yeah.

193
00:09:19,105 --> 00:09:22,939
Come, messenger, let us walk.

194
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:29,147
The great Xerxes has
taken over the world...

195
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:30,978
with his vast Persian army...

196
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,213
and has set his sights
on his final conquest-

197
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:35,777
Sparta.

198
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:42,092
Let us talk
by the giant pit of death.

199
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:43,753
Okay.

200
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,593
Xerxes is a kind god-king...

201
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:47,098
and offers these...

202
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,464
peaceful alternatives to war.

203
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:53,301
No blood will be shed...

204
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:56,467
as long as you Spartan
men build his pyramids...

205
00:09:56,542 --> 00:10:00,103
your women become his sex slaves...

206
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:01,908
and your children...

207
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,710
work at sweatshops...

208
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,546
making Nikes.

209
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,721
That sounds reasonable.

210
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,050
CAPTAIN: I'm sure you would...

211
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,025
think so, Councilman Traitoro.

212
00:10:15,695 --> 00:10:18,163
(woman sings slow,
exotic, ethereal theme)

213
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:21,200
(wind whistling softly)

214
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:34,175
##

215
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,851
Tell Xerxes...

216
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,517
(passionate moaning)

217
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:50,357
...to take his proposal...

218
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,591
and shove it!

219
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:54,360
What the hell?!

220
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:56,493
What? He came on to me!

221
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:57,763
I did not.

222
00:10:57,837 --> 00:11:00,032
Dawg, your wife's a ho.

223
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:04,439
This means war!

224
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,705
Hey, hey, hey, it's cool, it's cool.

225
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,303
Uh, we got San Francisco...

226
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:09,609
and West Hollywood.

227
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:11,616
We don't need Sparta.
(chuckles)

228
00:11:11,684 --> 00:11:13,914
I'll just tell Xerxes
it's a "no go."

229
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:16,515
(chuckles)

230
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:23,191
Kick his ass in.

231
00:11:25,765 --> 00:11:27,426
This is madness!

232
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,525
Madness?

233
00:11:32,338 --> 00:11:35,102
This is Sparta!

234
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,578
Why did you do that?

235
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:44,946
He was backing down.

236
00:11:45,952 --> 00:11:47,419
(yells)

237
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:51,890
My lord, he will
tell Xerxes that Sparta...

238
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,926
is not for them,
so, whatever you do...

239
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:55,654
don't kick him
into the pit of death.

240
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:58,253
Stop kicking people
into the pit of death. Really!

241
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:01,092
WOMAN:
# Oh, no #

242
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:02,794
# Oh, yeah #

243
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:05,394
# Uh-huh, yeah. #

244
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,665
I don't know why y'all...

245
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:09,003
have to always get on
my back for everything.

246
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,667
I'm a responsible adult.

247
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,768
Look at me-
I'm booby-feeding my baby.

248
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:14,676
Sometimes I like to
give him fried milk.

249
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:15,941
I call 'em milk poppers.

250
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:17,243
It's just like breast milk,
but it's fried.

251
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:18,544
And you just pop 'em in your mouth.

252
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:19,676
He loves 'em.
Don't you, baby!

253
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:21,913
# Goo-goo, gah-gah #

254
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:24,855
# Gah-gah, gah-gah-gah-gah. #

255
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:26,824
(raspy panting)

256
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,622
I'm a smart shopper.

257
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:31,527
I got this entire outfit in
an alleyway from a Mexico woman.

258
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:32,723
# Bargain #

259
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,959
# Shopping #

260
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:35,330
#Yeah. #

261
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:36,959
Why do y'all think I'm messed up?

262
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:39,527
Shit! Do I look crazy to you?

263
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:47,512
(echoing): Oh...

264
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,276
my God!

265
00:12:50,483 --> 00:12:52,110
Aw, damn, cuz!

266
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:53,584
There goes my palimony!

267
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,245
K-Fed ain't havin' it, yo.

268
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:57,653
K-Fed, come back to me, please!

269
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:00,123
Please? I'll let you under my skirt.

270
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:01,820
There goes K-Fed's cheddar, yo.

271
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:03,589
(screaming)

272
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,330
MAN:
# Oh, yeah! #

273
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,596
#Ah-ah-ah, yeah! #

274
00:13:09,669 --> 00:13:13,105
(singing off-key):
# Ooh-ooh-ooh! #

275
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:14,469
(screeching):
#Yeah! #

276
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,132
(sobbing)

277
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,176
#Yeah! #

278
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:18,267
(shrieks)

279
00:13:18,344 --> 00:13:22,337
# I'm not gay! #

280
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:24,175
(groans)

281
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,548
Leonidas.

282
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:27,847
Ryan Seacrest?

283
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,617
How did you feel about that kick?

284
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,285
Let's see what the judges
have to say.

285
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,294
- Randy?
- Yo, Leo, dawg, man...

286
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:39,160
I, I wasn't really feelin' you
on that kick, dawg.

287
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,132
I don't know what happened, man.

288
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,997
It was just
all right for me, dawg.

289
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:45,731
- I mean, just all right, dawg.
- Paula?

290
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:49,536
Leonidas...

291
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,134
you...

292
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:53,974
move me.

293
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,707
(voice breaking):
Y-

294
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,246
I don't-

295
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:00,250
Simon?

296
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,377
Leonidas...

297
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:03,922
I thought the kick...

298
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,323
was utterly... dreadful.

299
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:08,417
Oh... Simon-

300
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:09,859
In fact, I've seen better kicks...

301
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,556
from a geriatric donkey.

302
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:12,723
Oh- (sputters)

303
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:14,823
And I'm not talking
about you, Paula.

304
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:17,335
I am sorry, King...

305
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:21,806
but your journey ends here.

306
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:24,940
Oh, go (bleep) yourselves!

307
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:28,174
- What are y?
- (judges screaming)

308
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:30,681
(screams echoing)

309
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:41,126
(sniveling)

310
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:43,185
(whimpering)

311
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:53,467
(echoing): Seacrest out!

312
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:55,564
Excellent work, my king.

313
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:59,008
It's time to consult
with the prophets.

314
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:01,672
(sighs)

315
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:09,520
(screams echoing)

316
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:15,652
NARRATOR:
<i>The ancient prophets were advisers to the king.</i>

317
00:15:15,728 --> 00:15:21,189
<i>Grotesque swine, their consult</i>
<i>came with a bribe.</i>

318
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,494
(excited grunting)

319
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,471
Oh. Oh, Oxy 10.

320
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,633
Oh, Neutrogena.

321
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,176
This has an SPF.

322
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:32,506
Th-This is all-day protection.

323
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:34,136
Look at this.

324
00:15:34,213 --> 00:15:35,805
Exfoliator with alpha hydroxy.

325
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:36,848
This is good for you, Glenn.

326
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,884
Rub it all over
your disgusting face.

327
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,850
What need you, King Leonidas?

328
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:45,356
Ancient prophets...

329
00:15:45,424 --> 00:15:47,324
I need your guidance.

330
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:51,022
I'm assembling an army
of 300 to go to war with Persia.

331
00:15:51,097 --> 00:15:55,466
I'm going to take them in the rear.

332
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,764
Here, here.

333
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:58,826
(snickers)

334
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:00,804
And then I'm gonna reach around...

335
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:01,965
(chuckles)

336
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,066
...and I'm gonna take them again
from the front!

337
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:05,201
(snickering)

338
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:06,210
What?!

339
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,576
Why are you sniggering?!

340
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:09,342
Nothing.

341
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:10,939
It's- no-nothing-

342
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:11,949
- (clears throat)
- (snickering continues)

343
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,315
What's so damn funny?!

344
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,320
Look, it's all there for you to see!

345
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:16,719
These are battle formations!

346
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:17,721
(chuckling): Battle form-

347
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,916
That's what he calls them!

348
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:22,483
It looks like backstage
at an Elton John concert!

349
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,721
Cut it out!
This isn't funny!

350
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,286
This is serious business!

351
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:26,353
(moans)

352
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,593
No Spartan goes to war...

353
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,898
without first consulting...

354
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,131
the oracle!

355
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:39,236
(ethereal, ominous music plays)

356
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,684
NARRATOR:
<i>The prophets chose only the most beautiful...</i>

357
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,824
<i>of Spartan girls to be their oracle.</i>

358
00:17:02,902 --> 00:17:04,597
Oh-

359
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,365
Ugly Betty?

360
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,839
She has a great personality.

361
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:10,307
##

362
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:13,471
Eww!

363
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:14,911
I look like Jabba the Hutt.

364
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,345
That is hot to me.

365
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:18,610
(sneezing)

366
00:17:18,684 --> 00:17:21,016
(exotic techno melody playing)

367
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,384
(slurping)

368
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,693
Oh-

369
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:40,231
(whispering): See-nah skah-nah...

370
00:17:40,306 --> 00:17:43,571
labwana no-cho dame.

371
00:17:43,642 --> 00:17:47,043
"Fo' shizel my nizzel."

372
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:50,048
(indistinct whispering)

373
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:53,552
"Save the cheerleader...
save the world."

374
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:56,349
Actually, I'm, I'm not into <i>Heroes.</i>

375
00:17:56,422 --> 00:17:58,515
"Douche bag says what?"

376
00:17:58,591 --> 00:17:59,387
What?

377
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:00,857
(snickering)

378
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:03,053
(prophets snickering)

379
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:04,061
(whispering indistinctly)

380
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,688
"Chest waxer says what?"

381
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:06,663
- What?
- (snickering)

382
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:07,926
(chortling)

383
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,662
(chuckling):
He walked into that one.

384
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:12,931
What, what are you saying to me?
I don't understand.

385
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:16,270
Go to war with Persia
and you will surely die.

386
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:21,936
You're screwed, dude.

387
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:28,643
(exotic, ethereal theme plays)

388
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:47,069
(women laughing)

389
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:48,163
What?!

390
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,969
(laughter continuing)

391
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:54,846
He looks like a Ken doll!

392
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:58,543
(laughter continues)

393
00:18:58,617 --> 00:18:59,879
It's cold!

394
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:20,871
Tommy Lee?

395
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,578
Shaq?

396
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:31,715
Borat?

397
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,351
(whispering): Oakland Raiders?

398
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,657
Why is my king so restless?

399
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:45,026
Can't sleep.

400
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:48,965
It's this whole Battle
of Thermopylae thing.

401
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:52,936
Are you still thinking about
what that young oracle said?

402
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,438
(sighs)

403
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:57,271
There's only one woman whose
words you should listen to.

404
00:19:58,544 --> 00:19:59,602
Oprah.

405
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:00,975
Your wife?

406
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:03,139
Right, right.

407
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:05,410
How will I be tried...

408
00:20:05,484 --> 00:20:07,076
in the court of public opinion?

409
00:20:08,954 --> 00:20:12,117
Well, Harry Knowles
at "Ain't It Cool News"...

410
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:15,752
says this movie is just
a cheap rip-off of <i>300.</i>

411
00:20:18,063 --> 00:20:21,055
(woman laughing)

412
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:22,464
- (grunts)
- (other women gasp)

413
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:25,299
Even if the oracle
doesn't support you, I do.

414
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:27,669
And Sparta does.

415
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,765
This could be
our last night together.

416
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:32,434
You wanna do it?

417
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:34,411
Like we've never done it before.

418
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,641
(exhales)

419
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:43,080
(passionate, breathy moaning)

420
00:20:56,068 --> 00:20:57,660
(sighs)

421
00:20:57,736 --> 00:21:01,103
...97... 98...

422
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:03,641
...99...

423
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:05,267
(grunting):100!

424
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:08,404
Beat my record.

425
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,708
- (grunts)
- (shrieks)

426
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:15,679
Captain.

427
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:17,016
My king.

428
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:26,324
Have you assembled
my army who are ready...

429
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:29,265
to fight to the death
for the freedom of Sparta?

430
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:30,461
Yes, King.

431
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:39,440
I wanted 300.

432
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:42,275
This seems like... less.

433
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:44,282
These were the only men
who met with your stringent...

434
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,284
specifications.

435
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:48,616
"Hunky with deep
Mediterranean tans...

436
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:50,086
"hot bods..."

437
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:52,055
and, uh...

438
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:52,954
Yes?

439
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:54,287
"...well endowed."

440
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,622
SPARTANS: Haawoo! Haawoo!

441
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:56,820
Haawoo!

442
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:58,453
Ready to fight for you, my king!

443
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,498
Never give up!
Never surrender!

444
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:03,729
To infinity and beyond!

445
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:08,031
CAPTAIN:
He has a lot of heart, my king.

446
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:09,768
And nice man boobs.

447
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,873
Indeed.

448
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,213
These men will do.

449
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:23,152
You are a fine captain, Captain.

450
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:26,385
But a better friend...
there is none.

451
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,085
Thank you.

452
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:42,967
Thank you.

453
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:44,270
Thank you.

454
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:45,401
Mm-hm.

455
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:46,409
Damn!

456
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:50,682
He's got a huge package.

457
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:58,285
I brought you some fudge.
Mom said that you like to pack it.

458
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,086
She's a good woman.

459
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,252
Good-bye, Father.

460
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:03,690
(sighs): Farewell, my son.

461
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:05,423
(Leonidas clears throat)

462
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:07,692
Introductions?

463
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:10,098
King Leonidas,
this is my son, Sonio.

464
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:11,693
My king.

465
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,204
Why is he not fighting?

466
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,467
Well, he is not a warrior.

467
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:16,735
And he's my only son...

468
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:19,277
destined to carry on my name.

469
00:23:20,913 --> 00:23:22,471
What do you think?

470
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:24,641
Yummy.

471
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:26,708
Work it, sister.

472
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:28,878
I think he's fierce.

473
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:30,216
(rap beat plays)

474
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:31,847
# Come and give it 2 me #

475
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:34,825
#You know you want my body,
need my body #

476
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:36,121
# Show me them goodies... #

477
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:37,457
And if you don't like it...

478
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:40,054
you can kiss my fat ass!

479
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,259
(smacks)

480
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,301
Ooh!
Oh!

481
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:44,300
#... Watchin' your curves #

482
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:45,358
#Thinking of words, baby #

483
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:46,404
# My vision is blurred... #

484
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:48,463
Congratulations, Sonio.

485
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,599
You're now on your way
to becoming Sparta's...

486
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,109
(whispering): next top warrior!

487
00:23:52,177 --> 00:23:53,144
#... right where my mind is #

488
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:54,873
# Gimme your goody
and your body #

489
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:56,175
# Uh! Come and give it 2 me #

490
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,512
#You know you want my body,
need my body #

491
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:00,211
# Show me them goodies #

492
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:03,345
#You're gonna love my body,
touch my body... #

493
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:05,117
QUEEN MARGO: Spartan!

494
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:15,332
(sighs): My child...

495
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,664
I shall never forget you.

496
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:20,068
You are so small now...

497
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:23,472
but one day you will grow
to be big and strong...

498
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:24,839
like your father.

499
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,275
That's not your son.

500
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,778
You asshole.

501
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:38,647
Take care of your mother.

502
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:43,785
Stay tough, Son.

503
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:51,668
Come back with your shield...

504
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:53,568
or on it.

505
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:57,166
And if I come back on it,
I want you to move on.

506
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:59,210
I would never.

507
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:01,371
Hell, if you died,
I'd play the field.

508
00:25:01,446 --> 00:25:02,970
To be honest...

509
00:25:03,048 --> 00:25:06,484
I've always wanted
to do a fat chick.

510

The men are ready, my king.

513
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:40,214
Good. We'll head south
to the Hot Gates...

514
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:42,549
where we'll intercept
the Persian army.

515
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:43,986
Where are you going?

516
00:25:44,056 --> 00:25:47,025
The oracle said if we went
to war, we'd be screwed.

517
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:51,654
The oracle also said that
our painted-on abs look fake.

518
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,595
But I beg to differ.

519
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:57,931

521
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:04,367
Give the order, Captain.

522
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:08,038
- (keypad beeping)
- Spartans! In formation!

523
00:26:08,113 --> 00:26:09,444
OTHERS: Ah-ooh!

524
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:12,381
(whispering) Spartans heading south.

525
00:26:20,158 --> 00:26:21,455
Move out!

526
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:24,256

529

What do you think, my king?

556
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:45,402
We'll use the narrow
passageway of the Hot Gates...

557
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:47,274
to funnel the Persians in...

558
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:50,747
where their vast numbers
won't count for shit.

559
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:53,341
Captain, have the men found
any other trails...

560
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:55,818
that the Persians
could use to attack us?

561
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:57,320
None, sir.

562

WOMAN (in low, distorted voice):
I know such a road, my king.

563
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,267
Back off, hideous creature.

564
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,496
There's a secret goat path
just above the Hot Gates.

565
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:15,165
If the Persians found it,
they could outflank you.

566
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,707
Slow your roll, Captain.

567
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:20,568
Reveal yourself, creature.

568
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:25,609
Paris Hilton?

569
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:26,708
Hey, fellas.

570
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,275
What happened to you?

571
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:30,844
(chuckles): Oh.
You mean the hump?

572
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,448
Yeah. The hump.

573
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:35,288
It was all that,
"You're going to jail.

574
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,884
"Now you can get out of jail.

575
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:38,259
Now you're going back to jail."

576

And on and on and on and on- Ugh.

577
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,361
It's just been really confusing.

578
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:45,494
I mean, even Tinkerbell's
affected by it.

579
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,935
She hasn't moved since Saturday.

580
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:48,905
But she still poops, which is weird.

581

582
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:53,237
they've turned me into this, like...

583
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,905
totally grotesque monster!

584
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:57,949

Hello?

Oh, hey, Nicole.

590
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,794
Nothing. Just some guys with swords.

591
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:12,989
No, I'm talking about their
actual swords, Nicole.

592
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,327
You're gross.

593
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,991
Yeah, I'm hungry.
Did you eat?

594
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:17,433
Oh, you ate an almond?

595
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:19,595
Oh, yeah, you're done
eating for the day.

596
00:29:19,671 --> 00:29:22,606
Okay. And then let's go to Pinkberry.

597
00:29:22,674 --> 00:29:23,834
Bye, sexy.

it's my dream to be a Spartan.

602
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:35,317
I want to fight for you,
my king.

603
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:41,826
- What can you do?
- Well- Mmm.

604
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:45,556
Have you seen my video?

605
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,963
I don't like the way
you handle a spear.

606
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:51,832
You grip the shaft firmly.

607
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:54,030
Then with one hand on the base...

608
00:29:54,106 --> 00:29:57,405
you slide the other
all the way up to the tip.

609
00:29:58,577 --> 00:30:01,341
That's hot.

610

Come on, man,
can we talk about this?

Yo, I just met
these dudes right here.

"Real Men of Genius."

MALE SINGER:
# Real men of genius! #

Today we salute you...

767
00:37:04,369 --> 00:37:06,837
Mr. Warmongering Latent Homosexual.

768
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:10,306
# Mr. Warmongering
Latent Homosexual! #

769
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:12,707
Wearing nothing but
leather underwear and a cape...

770
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:15,803
you charge your enemy like
an oiled-up hairless wonder.

771
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,872
# Spray-on tan! #

772
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,315
Sure, there's danger-

773
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:22,353
charging rhinos,
stampeding elephants...

774
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,379
and that cute toga-wearing guy
named Chad.

775
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:27,754
# Ooh! #

776
00:37:27,825 --> 00:37:29,520
You only went out on one date...

777
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:30,822
but you'll remember it...

778
00:37:30,895 --> 00:37:32,863
(echoing): forever, forever...

779
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:35,832
#Take your daily Valtrex! #

780
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,994
Your keen instincts tell you
to cut, slice and chop...

781
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,697
every man you see.

782
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:43,400
But enough about your career
as a hair stylist...

783
00:37:43,474 --> 00:37:45,203
let's talk war.

784
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:47,904
# Ow! That curling
iron is hot! #

785
00:37:47,979 --> 00:37:50,447
So this Butt's for you,
King Leonidas...

786
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:52,346
because when the going gets tough...

787
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,078
the tough go antiquing.

788
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:58,589
# Mr. Warmongering
Latent Homosexual... #

789
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:01,790
#Yeah. #

790
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:04,685
Queen Margo...

791
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:06,787
we must speak.

792
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:08,354
(exhales)

793
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:10,663
Loyalist, what do you want?

794
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:15,805
Nice tomatoes.

795
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:18,433
Your husband needs you.

796
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:20,272
(sighs)

797
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:21,972
You must convince the council...

798
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,446
to send more troops
to support your husband.

799
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:26,005
My husband is dead.

800
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:27,847
He told me to move on.

801
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:30,820
Besides, I'm already
registered on J Date.

802
00:38:30,888 --> 00:38:32,515
A little to the right.

803
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,989
- (soft crunching)
- That's it.

804
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:36,754
If Leonidas fails,
Xerxes will take over...

805
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:39,456
and you will be stripped
of your crown.

806
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,964
I won't be queen?

807
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,126
- (masseuse grunts)
- Ow! That's too hard.

808
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:45,965
You will lose everything.

809
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:48,028
Ow! Ooh, stop.

810
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:50,472
Your palace, your Mercedes...

811
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,667
Hi-yah!

812
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:53,540
- Ow!
...your Nintendo Wii...

813
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:54,703
- (grunts)
- No, no, no, no, no.

814
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:55,871
- (grunts)
- Ow!

815
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:58,313
...your vaginal regeneration surgeon...

816
00:38:58,383 --> 00:38:59,645
Hi... yah!

817
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:00,979
...your gardener.

818
00:39:01,052 --> 00:39:01,848
(gasps)

819
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:05,885
Antonio?

820
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:09,354
(leaf blower whirring)

821
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:11,918
(lively Latin disco music playing)

822
00:39:11,996 --> 00:39:13,258
(passionate sigh)

823
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:15,822
(music continues)

824
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:19,535
(kisses, blows)

825
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:23,603
My husband needs me.

826
00:39:23,675 --> 00:39:25,267
I'll do whatever it takes.

827
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:26,503
I will set...

828
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:28,306
the meeting with the council.

829
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:30,279
But in order to win their vote...

830
00:39:30,348 --> 00:39:33,215
you will need to get
Traitoro's support.

831
00:39:35,353 --> 00:39:37,617
He holds great influence...

832
00:39:37,689 --> 00:39:39,452
with the council.

833
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:40,718
(masseuse yells)

834
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,420
QUEEN MARGO:
There better be a happy ending.

835
00:39:43,628 --> 00:39:46,028
(indistinct chatter)

836
00:39:53,204 --> 00:39:55,399
King Leonidas!

837
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:57,065
Xerxes approaches.

838
00:39:58,109 --> 00:39:59,440
NARRATOR: <i>Xerxes.</i>

839
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,741
<i>He looked a lot like</i>
<i>that fat guy from</i> Borat.

840
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:05,908
(exotic theme plays)

841
00:40:08,786 --> 00:40:11,482
I am the great god-king Xerxes.

842
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:12,716
- (loud rip)
- Ooh!

843
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,620
ALL: Ooh!

844
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:16,592
(groans, hisses in pain)

845
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:18,060
Ow, ow, ow!

846
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:19,892
Not again!
That always happens.

847
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:22,723
- (stapler clacks)
- OTHERS: Ow!

848
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,233
(groans)

849
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:25,735
(stapler clatters)

850
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:26,895
Whew!

851
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:30,401
(exhales sharply)

852
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:39,673
- (cracking)
- (men groaning)

853
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:40,809
(yells, thuds)

854
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:42,147
ALL: Damn!

855
00:40:45,323 --> 00:40:47,018
- Oh, s-sorry, Xerxes.
- It's cool.

856
00:40:47,091 --> 00:40:48,786
It's cool, cool. I'm fine.

857
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,851
I meant to do that.
(chuckles)

858
00:40:50,928 --> 00:40:52,122
- (gunshot)
- (grunts)

859
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:53,527
ALL: Oh, shit!

860
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:55,225
I'll tell you, kid, you got balls.

861
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:56,891
I come over here with a big army.

862
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:58,526
We going to shish kebab your ass.

863
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:01,265
Before this battle is over...

864
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:02,931
people will know...

865
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:05,032
that even a god-king can fall.

866
00:41:05,109 --> 00:41:07,634
Listen, Leo, I came here to talk.

867
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:10,044
Just listen to my deal.

868
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,111
Ladies!

869
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:16,619
WOMEN: Hi, Xerxes.

870
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:17,984
(laughter)

871
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:20,353
- (phone ringing)
- Ah, that's probably for me.

872
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:22,652
Hello?

873
00:41:22,727 --> 00:41:24,319
Really?

874
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:26,363
Okay.

875
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:28,625
That was the banker.

876
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:29,893
He's offering...

877
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:31,992
to buy back your briefcase...

878
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:34,162
for a weekend getaway for two...

879
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:36,331
in Las Vegas, Nevada...

880
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:38,034
at the Palms Hotel and Casino!

881
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:39,667
WOMEN: Ooh...

882
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:41,006
I've always wanted to go there!

883
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:44,479
All you have to do
is bow down to me...

884
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:47,643
...and surrender Sparta.

885
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,314
Deal...

886
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:51,878
or no deal?

887
00:41:51,956 --> 00:41:53,253
(Spartans shouting advice)

888
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:54,882
- Deal!
- Deal!
- Take it!

889
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,221
Take the deal!

890
00:41:56,294 --> 00:41:57,886
You think I should? No!

891
00:41:57,962 --> 00:41:59,122
- Take the deal!
- It's simple.

892
00:41:59,197 --> 00:42:00,425
- Take the deal!
- Come on!

893
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:01,897
What about Sparta?

894
00:42:01,966 --> 00:42:02,990
- Hit the button!
- Come on!

895
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:05,035
WOMEN: Take the deal! Take it!

896
00:42:05,102 --> 00:42:06,899
- Take it!
- Take the deal!

897
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:08,063
Hit the button!

898
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:09,902
(shouting continues)

899
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:10,770
Take it!

900
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:13,538
No deal!

901
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:16,045
- (groans, angry grunts)
- Oh, great!

902
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:18,343
By the time I'm finished with you...

903
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:20,384
Sparta will be annihilated.

904
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:23,079
It will be as though
you never existed.

905
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:24,883
I will see to it that you are...

906
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:26,446
written out of the history books.

907
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:31,228
Well, that's fine by me, Xerxes...

908
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,763
because I can't read.

909
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:35,865
(slow, ominous theme plays)

910
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:39,300
NARRATOR:
<i>Xerxes didn't take rejection well.</i>

911
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,464
<i>From every corner of his empire...</i>

912
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,703
<i>he sent his most</i>
<i>vicious warriors to fight.</i>

913
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:48,176
Yo mama's so ghetto,
when she breast-feeds...

914
00:42:48,246 --> 00:42:50,214
Kool-Aid comes out!

915
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:52,545
(derisive shouts, laughter)

916
00:42:57,321 --> 00:42:59,881
Yo mama's so stupid,
she thought Tupac Shakur...

917
00:42:59,957 --> 00:43:01,925
was a Jewish holiday!

918
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:04,723
(derisive shouts, laughter)

919
00:43:04,795 --> 00:43:06,922
(clucking like a chicken)

920
00:43:08,699 --> 00:43:10,792
Get her, Dilio!

921
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:14,304
Yo mama's so fat, her
pants size is, um, um, um...

922
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:16,135
"Bitch, lose some weight"!

923
00:43:16,207 --> 00:43:17,936
(laughter, shouts)

924
00:43:18,009 --> 00:43:19,237
Your mama's so butch...

925
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,335
Rosie O'Donnell
wouldn't even date her.

926
00:43:21,412 --> 00:43:24,006
Uh-uh! No, you didn't!
No, you didn't!

927
00:43:24,081 --> 00:43:25,412
- Whoa!
- No, you didn't!

928
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:28,509
Well, yo mama titties
is smaller than yours.

929
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:31,419
(others hooting)

930
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:33,753
Bounce some D's on that bitch!

931
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:36,418
Your mama's so fat,
Sir Mix-A-lot decided...

932
00:43:36,494 --> 00:43:38,189
he doesn't like big butts!

933
00:43:38,262 --> 00:43:40,662
And he ain't lyin'!
Kiss that!

934
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:43,924
Oh! Ow!

935
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:45,468
Oh, my eyes!

936
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:47,697
Oh! Oh!

937
00:43:47,772 --> 00:43:48,932
LEONIDAS: Walk it off.

938
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:50,303
- How you like that, huh?
- Sit down.

939
00:43:52,376 --> 00:43:55,607
Yo, yo mama's so fat,
that when she farts...

940
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,240
Al Gore accuses her
of global warming, dawg.

941
00:43:58,316 --> 00:43:59,476
Whew!

942
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:01,882
Cranking it up!

943
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:05,753
Yes, well, that may be the case,
but your mama's so hairy...

944
00:44:05,823 --> 00:44:07,654
the only language she speaks...

945
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:09,352
is Wookiee!

946
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:11,691
- (roars like a Wookiee)
- (laughter) Oh!

947
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:13,195
(roaring like a Wookiee)

948
00:44:13,264 --> 00:44:14,993
That's it!

949
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:16,397
- Well, yo mama-
- (imitates Wookiee roar)

950
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:17,957
Yo ma-

951
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:21,168
- (roaring like a Wookiee)
- (Spartans laughing, talking)

952
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:22,296
Yes!

953
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:24,034
- (Spartans hooting)
- CAPTAIN: Bye-bye!

954
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:25,700
Back to the hood!

955
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:29,177
<i>Xerxes watched</i>
<i>as his warriors were defeated.</i>

956
00:44:29,246 --> 00:44:32,909
<i>It sent an all-too-human chill</i>
<i>up his spine.</i>

957
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:35,919
<i>Or perhaps that was</i>
<i>the Dentyne Ice...</i>

958
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:37,682
<i>with cool mint crystals.</i>

959
00:44:37,755 --> 00:44:40,246
(crackling)

960
00:44:46,364 --> 00:44:49,060
Loyalist said you wanted to see me.

961
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:52,563
That's my urine sample.

962
00:44:54,939 --> 00:44:56,270
Tastes like asparagus.

963
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,103
Leonidas needs more troops.

964
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:02,839
Without reinforcements,
Sparta will fall and-

965
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:05,040
(horn playing quiet mock gibberish)

966
00:45:06,951 --> 00:45:09,943
(horn continues playing mock gibberish)

967
00:45:12,023 --> 00:45:13,752
I'll do anything...

968
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:16,384
(softly): for my husband.

969
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,121
Anything?

970
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:22,457
(exhales seductively)

971
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:24,125
- (boinging)
- Awesome!

972
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:25,759
I'm so getting laid!

973
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:28,304
Good-bye, virginity.

974
00:45:28,372 --> 00:45:30,636
I promise you,
you're not going to enjoy this.

975
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:33,370
But I suffer from premature eja-

976
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:37,409
Oh-

977
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:38,641
Mmm.

978
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:41,150
It's okay: I have crabs.

979
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:45,916
(playing melody)

980
00:45:51,662 --> 00:45:53,823
(both giggle)

981
00:45:58,536 --> 00:46:00,595
WOMAN:
Ooh- (laughs)

982
00:46:03,674 --> 00:46:07,132
(percussive music continues)

983
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:09,304
(woman's echoing laughter)

984
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,645
XERXES:
Betray your beloved Spartans-

985
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,421
Nice.

986
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:23,293
and I will give you
anything you desire.

987
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,884
That's hot.

988
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:26,759
Bow down to me.

989
00:46:26,831 --> 00:46:28,890
(barking)

990
00:46:28,966 --> 00:46:31,230
Bow down to the great god-king...

991
00:46:31,302 --> 00:46:32,963
Xerxes.

992
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:34,629
I'm a Hilton.

993
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:36,229
I don't bow.

994
00:46:36,307 --> 00:46:37,569
(exasperated groan)

995
00:46:37,641 --> 00:46:39,040
But I do bend over.

996
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:41,237
Ah, good.

997
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:44,145
There's a secret goat path
into the Hot Gates.

998
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:47,446
You could totally use it
to defeat Leonidas.

999
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:50,544
Ah- (laughs)

1000
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:52,885
And what do you desire?

1001
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:55,118
I want my record expunged.

1002
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,957
Oh, and I want
that new Chanel purse.

1003
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:00,790
Thank you.

1004
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:03,595
I want throwing up to be fun.

1005
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:06,261
You got something to say,
say it- I got things to do.

1006
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,396
(quietly): What was it?

1007
00:47:08,472 --> 00:47:09,769
I can't remem-

1008
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,569
Oh, God, geez, yeah.
(groans)

1009
00:47:11,642 --> 00:47:13,439
I want to get this hump removed.

1010
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:16,344
(chuckles)

1011
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:22,147
Mmm!

1012
00:47:28,292 --> 00:47:31,386
Will you please just do it?
It's really heavy and really hard to keep clean.

1013
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:33,657
Done.

1014
00:47:34,798 --> 00:47:37,392
- (loud pop)
- Aah!

1015
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:47,735
(slurping)

1016
00:47:47,811 --> 00:47:48,971
(exhales)

1017
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:50,980
As long as Xerxes doesn't find...

1018
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:53,346
the secret path to the Hot Gates...

1019
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:57,516
...their vast numbers
won't count for shit.

1020
00:47:57,588 --> 00:47:59,055
(panting)

1021
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:00,556
My king!

1022
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:04,627
Catch your breath.

1023
00:48:04,695 --> 00:48:06,526
Vanilla blended.

1024
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:08,895
What is it, boy?

1025
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:13,803
Xerxes has found
the secret goat path...

1026
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:14,963
through the Hot Gates.

1027
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:16,063
Aw, shit!

1028
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,438
Damn that Paris Hilton.

1029
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:20,374
(panting): I hate her.

1030
00:48:20,444 --> 00:48:21,934
He's deployed thousands
of Persian soldiers...

1031
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:23,274
that'll be here any minute.

1032
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:25,338
(panting)

1033
00:48:27,351 --> 00:48:28,648
(slurps)

1034
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,553
Dilio...

1035
00:48:32,623 --> 00:48:34,113
how bad are your injuries?

1036
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:37,422
Oh, it's, uh- it's
just a scratch, my king.

1037
00:48:37,494 --> 00:48:40,224
(dramatic, eerie theme plays)

1038
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:43,263
You've got no eyes.

1039
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:45,734
The gods blessed me with a spare.

1040
00:48:45,803 --> 00:48:47,395
No, they haven't.

1041
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:49,200
You just had the two.

1042
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:51,207
Jeremy has the spare.

1043
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:58,505
I can still fight!

1044
00:48:58,582 --> 00:49:00,243
(grunting)

1045
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:01,249
Whoa! No!

1046
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:02,842
- Dilio! Dilio!
- (shouting angrily)

1047
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,947
- Di- Dilio! Dilio! Dilio.
- (shouting)

1048
00:49:07,024 --> 00:49:08,423
Walk with me.

1049
00:49:10,094 --> 00:49:12,085
No. No. No.

1050
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:18,165
Your fate is the most important.

1051
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:23,366
You must go back to Sparta...

1052
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,873
and tell of our tale.

1053
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:27,103
Yes, my king.

1054
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:29,407
Any message for the queen?

1055
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:42,155
(wistful, gentle theme plays)

1056
00:49:42,226 --> 00:49:44,285
None that need be said.

1057
00:49:45,696 --> 00:49:47,459
Now go, Dilio.

1058
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:50,728
Tell how 13 Spartans
fought for honor...

1059
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:53,793
for glory...
for freedom!

1060
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:55,168
(grunts)

1061
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:57,799
Good luck, Dilio.

1062
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,810
(blades scraping)

1063
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:10,320
(low growling)

1064
00:50:10,387 --> 00:50:12,082
(steam hissing)

1065
00:50:12,156 --> 00:50:14,818
(growling)

1066
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:17,452
Spartans!

1067
00:50:24,735 --> 00:50:26,327
XERXES: This is your final chance.

1068
00:50:26,403 --> 00:50:29,497
Bow down to me or you will die.

1069
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:32,906
I bow for no man!

1070
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:39,644
Take a knee.

1071
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:40,843
No!

1072
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:43,512
- Curtsey.
- Enough!

1073
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:47,851
Well, your sandal is untied.

1074
00:50:47,925 --> 00:50:50,485
Oh... thanks very much.

1075
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,153
See?
Was that that difficult?

1076
00:50:52,229 --> 00:50:54,129
- No, wait, no!
- Ah-tah-tah-tah-tah-

1077
00:50:54,198 --> 00:50:56,530
- No, I wasn't bowing.
- No, no, no.

1078
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,794
I was just doing my shoe!

1079
00:50:57,868 --> 00:51:00,200
No, you acknowledged me
as your god-king.

1080
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,134
High-five!

1081
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:04,538
- (laughter)
- Ooh.

1082
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:06,041
What?

1083
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,476
(mocking, girlish laughter)

1084
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:10,376
What-What-What the hell is so funny?

1085
00:51:10,447 --> 00:51:12,210
- You!
- Me?

1086
00:51:12,282 --> 00:51:13,977
You greet like women.

1087
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:16,076
You idiots are
wearing banana hammocks...

1088
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:17,279
and you're laughing at me?

1089
00:51:17,354 --> 00:51:18,844
Now you're pissing me off.

1090
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:20,150
I'm getting everybody.

1091
00:51:20,224 --> 00:51:22,920
- (phone beeps)
- Hello. Where you at?

1092
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:24,221
I know where I'm at.

1093
00:51:24,294 --> 00:51:26,057
Bring in my vast army.

1094
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,222
You 13...

1095
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:28,821
putz are no match...

1096
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:30,491
for my massive Persian army.

1097
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:32,296
They number in the millions!

1098
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:39,408
That's just a blue screen.

1099
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:40,875
Stupid.

1100
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:42,878
It's a visual effect.

1101
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:44,811
It's going to be digitally
inserted later.

1102
00:51:44,882 --> 00:51:47,817
And the army is quite
impressive, as you can imagine.

1103
00:51:47,885 --> 00:51:49,853
- (electronic whir)
- (warriors grunt at once)

1104
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,323
(gasping)

1105
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:56,186
Gentlemen, may I present...

1106
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,626
Queen Margo.

1107
00:51:58,695 --> 00:52:02,426
(dance beat plays)

1108
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:05,866
(indistinct chatter)

1109
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:10,464
- (laughter)
- (whistling)

1110
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:13,203
(men whooping)

1111
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:18,214
(rhythmic vocals join beat)

1112
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:21,080
(whooping, indistinct chatter)

1113
00:52:24,221 --> 00:52:26,280
Come on, baby.
I'm gettin' a chubby.

1114
00:52:28,525 --> 00:52:31,323
Boner alert. Boner alert.

1115
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:33,260
Okay, boys, make it rain!

1116
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:35,298
# Do the D-A-N-C-E,
1-2-3-4 fight #

1117
00:52:35,365 --> 00:52:40,064
# Stick to the B-E-A-T,
get ready to ignite #

1118
00:52:40,137 --> 00:52:43,595
#You were such a P-Y-T,
catching all the light #

1119
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:47,166
#Just easy as A-B-C, that's how
you make it right... #

1120
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:48,541
(music fades out)

1121
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:50,011
(whooping and chatter fades)

1122
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:54,511
Good councilmen...

1123
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:56,018
I implore you.

1124
00:52:56,086 --> 00:53:01,114
Your king, my dear
husband, needs your help.

1125
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:02,920
Sparta will fall...

1126
00:53:02,993 --> 00:53:06,292
if you don't agree
to send the rest of our army.

1127
00:53:06,363 --> 00:53:10,163
(Traitoro clapping slowly)

1128
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:13,499
(clapping rhythmically)

1129
00:53:18,976 --> 00:53:20,944
Gentlemen, our only
hope for survival...

1130
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:23,741
is to surrender to Xerxes
and beg for his forgiveness.

1131
00:53:23,814 --> 00:53:28,012
Do not be swayed by the words
of this common prick-tease...

1132
00:53:28,085 --> 00:53:30,178
with crabs all up in her coochie.

1133

- MEN: Ooh-
- (scoffs)

1134
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:34,684
Oh, no, you didn't.

1135
00:53:34,758 --> 00:53:36,817
Yes. Yes, I did.

1136

Oh, no.

(vacuum whirring)

1164

Well, tickle my nipples
with a feather.

1171
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,304
Xerxes is in Traitoro's top five.

1172
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,371
ALL:
Grumble, grumble, grumble-

1173
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:40,882
Traitoro was a... traitor?

1174
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:42,782
- (gasps)
- Duh!

1175
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:44,778
All in favor...

1176
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:47,323
of sending more troops...
say aye.

1177
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:52,124
ALL: Aye! Aye! Aye!
Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye! Aye-

(bowstrings creaking)

1182
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:21,223
We have you surrounded.

1183
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:23,418
Lay down your weapons!

1184
00:56:23,493 --> 00:56:25,324
Come and get them!

1185

(grunting)

1187

Um-

1188
00:56:34,771 --> 00:56:38,207
A Spartan always protects
another man's rear.

1189
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:43,202
(grunts)

1190
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,009
Adjust your sword, boy.

1191
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:46,606
It's digging into my back.

1192
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:50,784
But I'm not wearing my sword.

1193
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:54,784
Carry on then.

1194
00:56:54,858 --> 00:56:56,689
CAPTAIN: My son.

1195
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,527
Today...
you are truly a Spartan.

1196
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:02,587
Thanks, Father.

1197

1202

Remember this day, boys!

1203
00:57:23,954 --> 00:57:27,151
For today is the day you die!

1204
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:29,784
- Huh?
- What? Huh?

1205
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:30,554
What?

1206
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:32,618
I- I mean they die.

1207
00:57:32,696 --> 00:57:35,494
Today's the day they die-
that's what I meant to say.

1208

Go for it.

For tonight, we dine...

1485
01:12:51,047 --> 01:12:52,844
at Hooter's!

1486
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:53,973
Hoo!

1487
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:56,678
- (rock music playing)
- (men cheering)

1488
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:58,720
##

1489
01:12:58,788 --> 01:13:00,415
Eat from them...

1490
01:13:00,489 --> 01:13:02,081
everything!

1491
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:03,591
And tip them...

1492
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:05,058
nothing!

1493
01:13:05,127 --> 01:13:07,027
MEN: Yeah! Yeah!

1494
01:13:07,096 --> 01:13:09,064
It's Two-fer Tuesday.

1495
01:13:09,131 --> 01:13:11,190
Yeah!

1496
01:13:11,267 --> 01:13:12,757
- LEONIDAS: Come on!
- No! Whoa!

1497
01:13:12,835 --> 01:13:14,928
(grunts)

1498
01:13:15,004 --> 01:13:17,199
Oh, isn't that sweet.

1499
01:13:17,273 --> 01:13:18,934
(boy screaming)

1500
01:13:19,975 --> 01:13:22,000
- (cracking)
- Oh! Oh-

1501
01:13:22,078 --> 01:13:24,012
Oh- Oh-

1502
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,775
That's my boy.

1503
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:28,846
Where do you think you're going?

1504
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:31,079
- Aah!
- You little pussy.

1505
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:32,984
##

1506
01:13:33,055 --> 01:13:35,023
No! No!

1507
01:13:35,091 --> 01:13:37,525
(boy yelling)

1508
01:13:37,593 --> 01:13:39,527
(loud crunch)

1509
01:13:39,595 --> 01:13:40,459
That's it.

1510
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:41,928
(laughs): Yay.

1511
01:13:41,997 --> 01:13:43,430
(boy yelling)

1512
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:45,262
(crazed laughing)

1513
01:13:45,334 --> 01:13:47,598
- (yells)
- (crash)

1514
01:13:49,271 --> 01:13:52,365
##

1515
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:56,138
If you can dodge a golf ball,
you can dodge a sword.

1516
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:59,037
Ha! You missed.

1517
01:14:00,182 --> 01:14:01,809
Ow!

1518
01:14:01,884 --> 01:14:04,318
He can outflank us now, my king.

1519
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,421
Men!

1520
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:11,585
(noble theme plays)

1521
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:16,320
We are facing certain death.

1522
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:18,457
Cherries.

1523
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:20,399
But...

1524
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:23,233
the joke's on them,
because they don't know...

1525
01:14:23,305 --> 01:14:26,604
that dying in battle
is the greatest honor...

1526
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:28,734
for any Spartan!

1527
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:31,245
(fierce roar)

1528
01:14:31,313 --> 01:14:33,804
(unenthusiastically): Ah-hoo.

1529
01:14:33,883 --> 01:14:37,284
God, that's a shitty plan.

1530
01:14:37,353 --> 01:14:39,651
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
Look, Leonidas...

1531
01:14:39,722 --> 01:14:41,587
war is not the answer.
Heh-heh.

1532
01:14:42,258 --> 01:14:44,158
Trust me, I know.

1533
01:14:44,226 --> 01:14:46,786
No! War is the answer!

1534
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:49,586
(loud crunch)

1535
01:14:50,933 --> 01:14:54,630
(ominous theme playing)

1536
01:14:58,107 --> 01:14:59,836
Where am I?

1537
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:06,305
Spidey, you're fired.

1538
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:10,513
(screams)

1539
01:15:13,889 --> 01:15:15,857
(shrieking)

1540
01:15:17,393 --> 01:15:19,520
ELLEN DeGENERES: Hi.
How are you, Leonidas?

1541
01:15:19,595 --> 01:15:20,857
(chuckles): Ellen.

1542
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:22,420
Listen, I don't know
why you're so upset.

1543
01:15:22,498 --> 01:15:24,227
You look great.
You know, the cape is great.

1544
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,392
Love the... diaper.

1545
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:26,593
I-I'd wear something very similar...

1546
01:15:26,669 --> 01:15:27,829
for Portia on Friday nights.

1547
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:29,063
We get frisky.

1548
01:15:29,138 --> 01:15:31,129
Hello, Leonidas.
(laughs)

1549
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:33,835
Wow, is it hot in here?
(laughs)

1550
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:37,037
Okay, Portia, Portia,
women, women, women.

1551
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:38,841
Women, you like
women. (laughs)

1552
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:40,040
I can see by your-

1553
01:15:40,115 --> 01:15:41,673
your reaction, you're not amused.

1554
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,742
It's the same reaction anyone
who went to see <i>Mr. Wrong</i> had.

1555
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,186
Uh, let's play a game-
maybe we could play a game.

1556
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:48,416
How about "Who Sneezed?"
(laughs)

1557
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:49,514
It's a real easy game.

1558
01:15:49,592 --> 01:15:51,025
We close our eyes
and someone sneezes...

1559
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:52,526
and you guess who.
(laughs)

1560
01:15:52,595 --> 01:15:54,722
If it was you, you win- 'cause
obviously, you know. (laughs)

1561
01:15:54,797 --> 01:15:55,821
Listen, chill out.

1562
01:15:55,898 --> 01:15:57,559
Let's just dance, shall we? Come on.

1563
01:15:57,633 --> 01:16:00,124
- (dance music playing)
- That's right. Oh, boy.

1564
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:01,499
(laughs): Okay.

1565
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,901
There you go, you're
getting the hang of it.

1566
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:05,532
- You know, back and forth-
- No, I can't do this!

1567
01:16:05,608 --> 01:16:06,939
(screams)

1568
01:16:07,009 --> 01:16:08,499
Yo mama's so ugly, if she was...

1569
01:16:08,577 --> 01:16:10,374
on the Spice Girls,
her name would be...

1570
01:16:10,446 --> 01:16:12,778
Dookie Spice!

1571
01:16:12,848 --> 01:16:14,509
Doo-doo!

1572
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,380
Leonidas. (chuckling)

1573
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:20,380
You should try Scientology.

1574
01:16:20,456 --> 01:16:22,287
I'm gonna set Katie free.

1575
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:24,948
BOTH: Yes!

1576
01:16:25,027 --> 01:16:26,756
I had to buy
a million and one glitters...

1577
01:16:26,829 --> 01:16:28,558
with my own money,
and I had to buy-

1578
01:16:28,631 --> 01:16:31,099
(quavering):
I put them on by hand, Simon...

1579
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:35,034
and my reputation is all I have,
and for you to sit here...

1580
01:16:35,104 --> 01:16:37,732
telling me that
I'm not intennigent-

1581
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:39,569
inte-
that I'm not intenni-

1582
01:16:39,642 --> 01:16:41,200
- Let me start over.
- Intelligent. Yeah.

1583
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:42,437
- Hang on.
- Intelligent. Yeah.

1584
01:16:42,511 --> 01:16:44,376
- DANE COOK: I looked everywhere.
- (groans)

1585
01:16:44,446 --> 01:16:46,505
Don't you hate when you're
on an airplane, you know...

1586
01:16:46,582 --> 01:16:48,675
and the captain's, like,
"If you look out the window...

1587
01:16:48,751 --> 01:16:50,548
to your left, you're gonna
see another plane"?

1588
01:16:50,619 --> 01:16:52,484
Am I right? See what
I'm talking about?

1589
01:16:52,554 --> 01:16:53,885
Another plane? Right?

1590
01:16:53,956 --> 01:16:55,446
Don't you hate when you're
in the supermarket...

1591
01:16:55,524 --> 01:16:56,889
you know, and you're in aisle three.

1592
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,256
And, like, " Clean up
on aisle three."

1593
01:16:58,327 --> 01:16:59,817
You know? And you're, like,
"What am I doing here?"

1594
01:16:59,895 --> 01:17:01,294
I'm in aisle three, huh? Right?

1595
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:03,797
You're all my fans, right?
You all love me, right?

1596
01:17:03,866 --> 01:17:05,333
Who saw <i>Employee of the Month?</i>

1597
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:06,800
Okay, that's cool.

1598
01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:08,097
Right? Yeah, what's up, Leonidas?

1599
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,967
Super fingers to you.

1600
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:11,006
No.

1601
01:17:11,073 --> 01:17:12,438
(smacking, whooshing)

1602
01:17:12,508 --> 01:17:13,600
Super fingers...

1603
01:17:13,676 --> 01:17:15,473
to you, Dane Cook!

1604
01:17:15,544 --> 01:17:16,943
(grunts)

1605
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:19,503
This is a metaphor for my career.

1606
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:20,843
You're off my MySpace page.

1607
01:17:20,916 --> 01:17:22,884
I'm really 42.

1608
01:17:22,952 --> 01:17:25,477
(relieved sigh)

1609
01:17:25,554 --> 01:17:26,851
Sorry, I didn't hear
what you said...

1610
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:28,219
(British accent): because
I can't understand you...

1611
01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:29,985
'cause you talk like this.

1612
01:17:30,059 --> 01:17:32,357
Your mama's such
an old sloppy drunk...

1613
01:17:32,428 --> 01:17:34,828
I thought she was David Hasselhoff.

1614
01:17:34,897 --> 01:17:36,922
- (laughter)
- Yeah!

1615
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:40,167
From <i>Knight Rider.</i>

1616
01:17:40,235 --> 01:17:41,361
Dinaladas, do-

1617
01:17:41,437 --> 01:17:42,927
Dot- Dingalidas, Dingalidas...

1618
01:17:43,005 --> 01:17:44,939
Dingledangle, do...

1619
01:17:45,007 --> 01:17:47,999
leg squats, and then
you will be a star...

1620
01:17:48,077 --> 01:17:49,669
you will be a star.

1621
01:17:49,745 --> 01:17:52,213
(whispering inaudibly)

1622
01:17:52,281 --> 01:17:56,445
The last episode of <i>Sopranos</i>
was most disappointing.

1623
01:17:56,518 --> 01:17:59,544
I mean, did Tony get whacked
or live or what?

1624
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:05,452
What happens in Vegas...

1625
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:08,052
stays in Vegas.

1626
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:12,464
You just-You keep doing
the thing you do...

1627
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:15,867
'cause... the do is thing you do.

get below me #

1631
01:18:25,014 --> 01:18:27,414
# Shake your thing
till you don't feel lonely #

1632
01:18:27,483 --> 01:18:29,383
# Hey, mister, break it down #

1633
01:18:29,451 --> 01:18:31,851
#You're a B-Boy
that nearly hit the ground #

1634
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:34,650
#You could play it real cool,
act the old school #

1635
01:18:34,723 --> 01:18:37,385
#Jump around until
your act is so cool #

1636
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:48,835

# One to the two,
two to the three #

1638
01:18:51,774 --> 01:18:53,969
# Clap your hands

1639
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:56,841
# Four to the five,
five to the six #
