(CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING)

2
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,746
He was the phenomenon of the '20s.

3
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:41,759
When you think, at the time, he was
as well-known as Lindbergh,

4
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:42,924
it's really quite astonishing.

(CROWD CHEERING)

6
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:49,547
<i>His story reflected
the nature of our civilization,</i>

7
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,886
<i>the character of our times,</i>

8
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,346
yet it was also one man's story.

9
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,730
And all the themes of our culture
were there.

10
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,439
Heroism, will, things like that.

11
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,652
But when you look back on it,
it was very strange.

12
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:12,525
<i>Well, it is ironic to see
how quickly he has faded from memory,</i>

13
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,622
considering what
an astounding record he made.

14
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,749
He was, of course, very amusing, but at
the same time touched a nerve in people,

15
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:27,172
perhaps in a way in which
they would prefer not to be touched.

16
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:30,336
It certainly is a very bizarre story.

'Cause they always good tippers

58
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,470
But on this particular night, I looked over
and here's a strange guy comin' in.

59
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,556
I'd never seen him before,
so I asked one of the others, I say,

00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,851
<i>"John, you know this guy?
You ever seen him?"</i>

the guy had disappeared.</i>

64
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:41,778
I don't know where he went to, but about
this time, the music usually gets started.

00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,696
And the band started... (SCATTING)
Playin', and I looked,

NARRATOR:
<i>New York City. It is several months later.</i>

<i>They tell police he was
an odd little man who kept to himself.</i>

00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,867
<i>Only two clues are found
in Zelig's Greenwich Village flat.</i>

77
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:28,252
<i>One, a photograph of Zelig
with Eugene O'Neill,</i>

<i>and one of him as Pagliacci.</i>

<i>Acting on a tip, they trace

<i>where, in the rear of a Chinese
establishment, a strange-looking Oriental</i>

81

<i>who fits the description
of Leonard Zelig is discovered.</i>

82
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,889
<i>Suspicious, the detectives
try to pull off his disguise,</i>

83
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,266
<i>but it is not a disguise,
and a fight breaks out.</i>

84
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,821
<i>He is removed by force,
and taken to Manhattan Hospital.</i>

85
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:05,566
<i>In the ambulance, he rants and curses
in what sounds like authentic Chinese.</i>

86
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,660
<i>He is restrained with a straitjacket.</i>

87
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,171
<i>When he emerges from the car
20 minutes later,</i>

88
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:17,167
<i>incredibly, he is no longer Chinese,
but Caucasian.</i>

89
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:22,173
<i>Bewildered interns place him
in the emergency room for observation.</i>

<i>At 7:00 a.m., Dr. Eudora Fletcher,
a psychiatrist, makes her usual rounds.</i>

91
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,390
When I first heard about this
emergency case that had been brought in,

92
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,726
I didn't think anything peculiar.

93
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:40,398
And when I first laid eyes on him,
it was a bit strange,

94
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,741
because I mistook him for a doctor.

95
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,028

- FLETCHER: <i>Oh, yes?</i>
- ZELIG: <i>Yes, yes, I work</i>

102
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,181
<i>mostly with delusional paranoids.</i>

- ZELIG: <i>Oh, there's not much to tell. I...</i>

104
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,178
<i>I work mostly on the Continent,</i>

105
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:17,018
<i>and I've written quite
a few psychoanalytic papers.</i>

106
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,194
<i>I've studied a great deal.
I worked with Freud in Vienna.</i>

107
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,034
<i>Yes, we broke over
the concept of penis envy.</i>

108
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,817
<i>Freud felt that it
should be limited to women.</i>

109
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,911
FLETCHER: <i>It's not that
he was making any sense at all.</i>

110
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,657
<i>It was just a conglomeration
of psychological double-talk</i>

111
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:37,923
<i>that he had apparently heard, or perhaps
was familiar with through reading.</i>

112
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,545
<i>The funny thing was
that his delivery was quite fluid,</i>

113
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,514
<i>and might have been really
quite convincing</i>

114

<i>to someone who did not know any better.</i>

NARRATOR: <i>Who was this Leonard Zelig</i>

116
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,679
<i>that seemed to create
such diverse impressions everywhere?</i>

117
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,360
<i>All that was known of him was that
he was the son of a Yiddish actor</i>

118
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,515
<i>named Morris Zelig,
whose performance as Puck</i>

119

<i>in the Orthodox version of</i> A Midsummer
Night's Dream, <i>was coolly received.</i>

<i>it is the bowling alley
that complains of noise.</i>

123
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,749
<i>As a boy, Leonard is
frequently bullied by anti-Semites.</i>

124
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,550
<i>His parents, who never take his part
and blame him for everything,</i>

125
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,838
<i>side with the anti-Semites.</i>

126
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,850
<i>They punish him often
by locking him in a dark closet.</i>

127
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:36,807
<i>When they are really angry,
they get into the closet with him.</i>

128
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,098
<i>On his deathbed,
Morris Zelig tells his son</i>

129
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,687
<i>that life is a meaningless
nightmare of suffering,</i>

130
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,702
<i>and the only advice
he gives him is to save string.</i>

131
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,445
<i>Though brother Jack
has a nervous breakdown,</i>

<i>and sister Ruth becomes
a shoplifter and alcoholic,</i>

133
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,746
<i>Leonard Zelig appears
to have adjusted to life.</i>

134
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,504
<i>Somehow, he seems to have coped.</i>

135
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:07,086
<i>And then, suddenly,
increasingly strange behavior.</i>

136
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,971
<i>Fascinated by the Zelig phenomenon,</i>

137
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,643
<i>Dr. Fletcher arranges
a series of experiments</i>

138
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,559
<i>and invites the skeptical staff
to observe.</i>

139
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:24,153
<i>With the doctors watching,
Zelig becomes a perfect psychiatrist.</i>

140
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,784
<i>When two Frenchmen are brought in,</i>

141
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,489
<i>Zelig assumes their characters
and speaks reasonable French.</i>

142
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:37,697
<i>In the company of a Chinese person,
he begins to develop oriental features.</i>

143
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,749
<i>By now, word has gotten out to the press,</i>

144

<i>and a public thirsting for thrills
and novelty is immediately captivated.</i>

00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:55,851
<i>The clamor is so great that Dr. Allan
Sindell is forced to issue a statement.</i>

146
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,604
We're just beginning
to realize the dimensions

147
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:02,522
of what could be the scientific
medical phenomenon of the age,

148
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,353
and possibly of all time.

149
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,355
NARRATOR:
<i>Fresh stories roll off the press every day</i>

150
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,651
<i>about Zelig and his puzzling condition.</i>

151
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,197
<i>Although the doctors claim
to have the situation in hand,</i>

152
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,913
<i>no two can agree on a diagnosis.</i>

153
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,670
I'm convinced
that it's glandular in nature

154
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,115
and although there's no evidence now
of any misfunction,

155
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:25,748
I'm sure that further tests
will show a problem in the secretions.

156
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,881
I'm certain it's something
he picked up from eating Mexican food.

157
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,417
This manifestation
is neurological in origin.

158
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,510
Now, this patient
is suffering from a brain tumor,

159
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,220
and I should not be surprised if,
within several weeks, he died.

160
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,354
Now, we have not as yet
been able to locate the tumor,

161
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:45,685
but we're still looking.

162
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,730
NARRATOR:
<i>Ironically, within two weeks' time,</i>

163
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,357
<i>it is Dr. Birsky himself
who dies of a brain tumor.</i>

164
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,909
<i>Leonard Zelig is fine.</i>

165
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,202
<i>Throughout the weeks
of testing and speculation,</i>

166
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,205
<i>Eudora Fletcher begins to feel
that the patient might be suffering</i>

167
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,669
<i>not from a physiological disorder,</i>

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,590
<i>but from a psychological one.</i>

169
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,296
<i>It is Zelig's unstable make-up,
she suggests,</i>

170
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,966
<i>that accounts for his metamorphoses.</i>

171
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,715
<i>The governing board of doctors
is hostile to her notion.</i>

172
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:23,812
<i>They conclude that Zelig's malady can be
traced to poor alignment of the vertebrae.</i>

173
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,938
<i>Tests prove them wrong, and cause
a temporary problem for the patient.</i>

174
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,954
<i>Now, the press and public
hang on every bit of news,</i>

175
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,783
<i>thoroughly absorbed
in the real-life drama.</i>

176
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,203
MAN: (ON RADIO) <i>The continuing saga
of the strange creature</i>

177
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,785
<i>at Manhattan Hospital goes on.</i>

178
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,334
<i>This morning, doctors report,
experiments were conducted</i>

179
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:50,286
<i>and several women of varying types were
placed in close proximity to the subject,</i>

180
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,259
<i>but no change occurred,
leading authorities to conclude</i>

181
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,720
<i>that the phenomenon
does not occur with women.</i>

182
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,723
<i>Later today, doctors will be experimenting
with a midget and a chicken.</i>

183
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,113
MAN: (ON NEWSREEL) <i>Leonard Zelig
continues to astound scientists</i>

184
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,818
<i>at New York's Manhattan Hospital,</i>

185
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,117
<i>where numerous tests have led nowhere</i>

186
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:17,202
<i>in determining the nature of
this astonishing manifestation.</i>

187
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,909
<i>He is confronted by two overweight men
at the request of the doctors.</i>

188
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:26,995
<i>As the men discuss their obesity,
an initially reticent Zelig joins in,</i>

189
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,330
<i>swelling himself to
a miraculous 250 pounds.</i>

190
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,670
<i>Next, in the presence of two Negro men,</i>

191
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,510
<i>Zelig rapidly becomes one himself.</i>

192
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,839
<i>What will they think of next?</i>

193
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:45,064
<i>Meanwhile, Americans all over
have their own reactions.</i>

194
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,019
I wish I could be
Lenny Zelig, the changing man.

195
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,559
I'd be different people, and maybe
someday my wishes will come true.

196
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:57,778
Leonard Zelig is
one of the finest gentlemen

197
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,201
in the United States of America!

198
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,073
He is the cat's pajamas!

199
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,002
NARRATOR:
<i>Trying a new approach, Dr. Fletcher</i>

200
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,037
<i>places the subject under hypnosis.</i>

201
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:12,792
FLETCHER:
<i>Tell me why you assume the characteristics</i>

202
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,376
<i>of the person you're with.</i>

203
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,415
ZELIG: (SLEEPILY) <i>It's safe.</i>

204
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:19,633
FLETCHER: <i>What do you mean?
What do you mean, "safe"?</i>

205
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,432
ZELIG: <i>Safe to...</i>

206
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,467
<i>To be like the others.</i>

207
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:29,772
FLETCHER: <i>Mmm-hmm. You want to be safe?</i>

208
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,072
- ZELIG: <i>I wanna be liked.</i>
- FLETCHER: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

209
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:40,068
NARRATOR: <i>Probing Zelig's unconscious,
Dr. Fletcher gradually puts together</i>

210
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,953
<i>the pieces of Zelig's behavioral puzzle.</i>

211
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,159
<i>Dividing her time between the hospital
and the 42nd Street library,</i>

212
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,620
<i>she writes her report.</i>

213
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,672
<i>A closed meeting of doctors listens</i>

214
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:57,296
<i>as Dr. Fletcher describes Zelig
as "a human chameleon."</i>

215
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,925
<i>Like the lizard that is endowed by nature
with a marvelous protective device</i>

216
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:07,263
<i>that enables it to change color and
blend in with its immediate surrounding,</i>

217
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,891
<i>Zelig, too, protects himself
by becoming whoever he is around.</i>

218
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,306
<i>The doctors listen,
and their reaction is skeptical.</i>

219
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,482
<i>"Impossible!" they claim."Preposterous!"</i>

220
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,027
<i>"If he's a lizard," quips one doctor,</i>

221
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:24,071
<i>"then we should not spend
good hospital money feeding him,</i>

222
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,954
<i>"but simply catch him some flies."</i>

223
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:41,007
We knew we had a good story
this time 'cause it had everything in it.

224
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,974
It had romance and it had suspense.

225
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,137
And then this fella, Zelig,
you know, he grew up poor.

226
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,564
I remember my city editor came to me.

227
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,639
He said "Ted, we want this story
on page one every day."

228
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:57,059
And in those days,
you'd do anything to sell papers.

229
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:03,145
To get a story, you'd jazz it up, exaggerate,
even maybe play with the truth a little bit.

230
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,988
But here was a story. It was a natural.

231
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,953
You just told the truth and it sold papers.
It never happened before.

232
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,463
NARRATOR:
<i>Overnight, Leonard Zelig has become</i>

233
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,828
<i>the main topic of conversation everywhere,</i>

234
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,416
<i>and is discussed
with amusement and wonder.</i>

235
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,875
<i>No social gathering
is without its Leonard Zelig joke,</i>

236
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,380
<i>and in a decade of popular dance crazes,
a new one sweeps the nation.</i>

237
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,097
MAN: (SINGING)
<i>There's a brand-new dance come up the river</i>

<i>Just jerk your head and shake your liver</i>

<i>Fo-do-do-de-oh,
make a face that's like a lizard</i>

241
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,358
<i>And feel that beat down in your gizzard</i>

242
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,490
<i>You're doin' the Chameleon</i>

243
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,823
<i>Ah!</i>

244
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,565
<i>Stick out your tongue
the way the reptiles do</i>

245
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,526
<i>Tryin' to catch a fly</i>

246

<i>Inflate your lungs like big crocodiles do</i>

<i>Throw your best gal down
right on the floor</i>

<i>And you're doin' the Chameleon</i>

251
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,216
<i>If you hold your breath till you turn blue</i>

252
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,428
<i>You'll be changing colors like they do</i>

253
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,509
<i>When you're doin' the Chameleon</i>

254
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:14,308

<i>You're doin' the Chameleon</i>

257
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,016
<i>Ah!</i>

<i>Shake your shoulders,
move your seat around</i>

<i>Get right down and kick your feet around</i>

<i>Doin' the Chameleon, fo-de-oh-do</i>

265
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,747
What's brown and white
and yellow and has four eyes?

266
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,129
Leonard Zelig at the League of Nations.

267
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,761
NARRATOR: <i>Not everyone, however,
was entranced by the human chameleon,</i>

268
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,257
<i>and amongst the fanatics,
he was a handy symbol of iniquity.</i>

269
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,938
MAN:
This creature personifies capitalist man!

270
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:05,241
A creature who takes many forms
to achieve ends,

271
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,696
the exploitation
of the workers by deception.

272
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,085
NARRATOR:
<i>To the Ku Klux Klan, Zelig, a Jew</i>

273
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,370
<i>who was able to transform himself
into a Negro or Indian,</i>

274
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,371
<i>was a triple threat.</i>

275
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,127
<i>Meanwhile, Dr. Fletcher,
certain that her findings are correct,</i>

276
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,971
<i>begs for time with her patient
to put her theories into operation.</i>

277
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,548
FLETCHER: <i>Do you recall the first time</i>

278
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,846
<i>you began behaving like the
people you were around?</i>

279
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:41,273
ZELIG: <i>In school, some very bright people</i>

280
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,270
<i>asked me if I read</i> Moby Dick.

281
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,856
FLETCHER: <i>Yes?</i>

282
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,150
ZELIG:
<i>I was ashamed to say I never read it.</i>

283
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,065
- FLETCHER: <i>And you pretended?</i>
- ZELIG: <i>Yes.</i>

284
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,120
FLETCHER: <i>When did the changes
begin happening automatically?</i>

285
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,329
ZELIG: <i>Years ago. St. Patrick's Day.</i>

286
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,786
<i>Wandered into a bar. Wasn't wearing green.</i>

287
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,085
<i>They made remarks. I turned Irish.</i>

288
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:10,919
FLETCHER: <i>You told them you were Irish?</i>

289
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,800
ZELIG:
<i>My hair turned red, my nose turned up.</i>

290
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:21,273
<i>Spoke about the great potato famine
and the little people.</i>

291
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,360
We do not agree with Dr. Fletcher's ideas.

292
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,193
We believe those ideas are pipe dreams.

293
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,396
We believe that any change
in Zelig's condition

294
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,367
is going to be brought about
through certain experimental drugs,

295
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,991
which, although risky,
have been known to work wonders.

296
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:44,081
NARRATOR: <i>Zelig is treated with
the experimental drug Somadril hydrate.</i>

297
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,379
<i>He undergoes severe mood changes,</i>

298
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,304
<i>and for several days
will not come off the wall.</i>

299
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,679
<i>Then, suddenly, as Dr. Fletcher
is beginning to make some progress,</i>

300
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,560
<i>the question of Zelig's fate
takes a new twist</i>

301
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:04,271
<i>as his half-sister, Ruth, shocks everyone
by removing him from the hospital.</i>

302
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,521
<i>He can be better cared for at home,
she tells the doctors.</i>

303
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:12,147
<i>He will be looked after, she explains,
by her and her dubious-looking lover,</i>

304
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,490
<i>Martin Geist, a businessman
and ex-carnival promoter.</i>

305
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,532
<i>There is very little resistance
amongst the doctors,</i>

306
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,369
<i>who are relieved
to be rid of the frustrating case.</i>

307
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:26,081
<i>Only Dr. Fletcher cares
about Zelig as a human being.</i>

308
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:31,549
<i>She insists he desperately needs
special care, but it is to no avail.</i>

309
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,558
No, no one was questioning
her legal right to Zelig,

310
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,933
I mean, she was his half-sister
and his guardian,

311
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:41,933
but she had a strange
boyfriend called Geist

312
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,690
<i>that... He'd been in jail
for real-estate fraud.</i>

313
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:49,648
He was selling the same piece of property
to a lot of the same people, and...

314
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,357
Matter of fact, a congressman
from Delaware bought it twice.

315
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,414
NARRATOR: <i>The crowds that lined
the roads to glimpse the human chameleon</i>

316
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,199
<i>tie up traffic for days.</i>

317
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,580
<i>He is a sight to behold
for tourists and children.</i>

318
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:08,748
<i>People from all over the country fight for
space to peek at this new wonderment.</i>

319
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:22,438
<i>Selling mementos while her brother
is allowed to be on exhibition</i>

320
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,603
<i>is only the beginning
for Ruth Zelig and Martin Geist.</i>

321
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,979
<i>Admission is charged
to twice-daily demonstrations</i>

322
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,232
<i>of Leonard's stunning prowess.</i>

323
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:36,154
<i>He does not disappoint, changing
appearance over and over upon demand.</i>

324
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:41,866
<i>Overnight, he has become
an attraction, a novelty, a freak.</i>

325
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:49,752
<i>In this 1935 film based on the life
of Zelig, called</i> The Changing Man,

326
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,336
<i>the atmosphere is best summed up.</i>

327
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,210
We can't give up custody of Leonard.

328
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,806
I know if I'm given the chance,
I can cure him.

329
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,631
It's no use.
Even our attorney says it's hopeless.

330
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,102
Really, Dr. Fletcher.

331
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,467
Uh... May I call you Eudora?

332
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,318
I tell you, somewhere behind
that vacuous face, that zombie-like stare,

333
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,063
is a real human being,
and I can bring it out.

334
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,359
- How?
- I'll think up some new way.

335
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:17,443
Some technique. Whatever it is,
it'll have to be personal.

336
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,954
There's not much I can do legally.
I'll try, but...

337
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,699
They don't care about him.
They'll exploit him.

338
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,872
All they see in him is a chance
to make more money. Look at this.

339
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,369
Already they're selling
this Leonard Zelig doll.

340
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,842
NARRATOR: <i>The film did not exaggerate.
There were not only Leonard Zelig pens</i>

341
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,470
<i>and lucky charms, but clocks and toys.</i>

342
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:39,545
<i>There were Leonard Zelig watches and
books, and a famous Leonard Zelig doll.</i>

343
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,302
<i>There were aprons,
chameleon-shaped earmuffs</i>

344
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,387
<i>and a popular Leonard Zelig game.</i>

345
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,055
WOMAN: (SINGING) <i>Everybody go chameleon</i>

346
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,941
<i>Everybody show chameleon</i>

347
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:56,522
<i>Take it fast or slow chameleon,
chameleon, chameleon days</i>

348
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,108
<i>Everybody think chameleon</i>

349
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,895
<i>Every time you blink, chameleon</i>

350
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:07,413
<i>In your kitchen sink, chameleon,
chameleon, chameleon days</i>

351
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:11,617
<i>They're so much fun,
they'll even jump right through a hoop</i>

352
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,549
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

353
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:17,304
<i>And they change color
when they're swimming in your soup</i>

354
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:18,762
<i>Boo-boop-be-doop</i>

355
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,128
<i>Flying in the air, chameleon</i>

356
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,893
<i>Crawling in your hair, chameleon</i>

357
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:29,388
<i>Take away all your care,
chameleon, chameleon, chameleon days</i>

358
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,270
NARRATOR: <i>There were many popular
songs inspired by Leonard Zelig,</i>

359
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,484
<i>tunes that swept the nation.</i>

360
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:42,485
MAN: (SINGING) <i>I want you for myself alone</i>

361
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:48,028
MEN: (SINGING) <i>Leonard the Lizard,
see him running across the floor</i>

362
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,197
<i>See him skittering out the door</i>

363
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:55,173
WOMAN: (SINGING)
<i>You have such reptile eyes</i>

364
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:59,709
<i>Eyes like a lizard that weave their spell</i>

365
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,125
NARRATOR: <i>In addition to
the products and endorsements,</i>

366
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,256
<i>there are the endless exhibitions.</i>

367
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,560
<i>In Hollywood, he is a great favorite
and is offered a film contract.</i>

368
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:12,476
<i>Clara Bow invites him
for a private weekend,</i>

369
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,653
<i>and tells him to bring
all his personalities.</i>

370
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,574
<i>In Chicago, he meets
heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey,</i>

371
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,276
<i>who clowns with Zelig
at his training camp.</i>

372
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:28,032
<i>In Washington, DC, he is introduced to
both Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.</i>

373
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:33,786
<i>In France he is hailed as "Le Lézard." He
is the toast of the Parisian music halls.</i>

374
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:38,075
<i>His performance endears him as well
to many leading French intellectuals,</i>

375
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,002
<i>who see in him a symbol for everything.</i>

376
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:46,181
<i>His transformation
into a rabbi is so realistic</i>

377
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:49,761
<i>that certain Frenchmen suggest
he be sent to Devil's Island.</i>

378
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:58,353
<i>At the Folies-Bergère, Josephine Baker
does her version of the Chameleon dance,</i>

379
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:03,276
<i>and later tells friends
she finds Zelig amazing, but a little lost.</i>

380
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:09,365
Everyone used to be at my place,
that is, everyone who was someone.

381
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:15,118
And occasionally, someone would bring

382
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,460
Zelig in... Leonard in.

383
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,714
Cole Porter was fascinated by Leonard,

384
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,205
and he once wrote a line in a song...

385
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:30,046
Uh..."You're the tops,
you're Leonard Zelig."

386
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,676
But then he couldn't find
anything to rhyme with "Zelig."

387
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,068
<i>I'm flyin' high</i>

388
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,355
<i>'Cause I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'</i>

389
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:52,447
<i>Fallin' for nobody else but you</i>

390
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,750
<i>You caught my eye</i>

391
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,788
<i>Now I got a feelin' I'm fallin'</i>

392
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:03,837
<i>Show me that ring
and I'll jump right through</i>

393
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,883
<i>I used to travel single, oh</i>

394
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,635
<i>We chanced to mingle, oh</i>

395
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,595
<i>Now I'm a-tingle over you</i>

396
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,942
<i>Hey, Mr. Zelig, stand by</i>

397
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,694
<i>'Cause I've got a feelin' I'm fallin'</i>

398
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:28,693
<i>Fallin' for nobody else but you, wow!</i>

399
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,248
NARRATOR: <i>Though the shows
and parties keep Zelig's sister</i>

400
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,953
<i>and her lover rich and amused,</i>

401
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,785
<i>Zelig's own existence is a nonexistence.</i>

402
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:43,288
<i>Devoid of personality, his human qualities
long since lost in the shuffle of life,</i>

403
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,749
<i>he sits alone, quietly staring into space,</i>

404
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:51,131
<i>a cipher, a non-person,
a performing freak.</i>

405
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:55,346
<i>He who wanted only to fit in, to belong,</i>

406
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,636
<i>to go unseen by his enemies and be loved,</i>

407
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:03,272
<i>neither fits in nor belongs,
is supervised by enemies,</i>

408
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,823
<i>and remains uncared for.</i>

409
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:10,153
<i>The board at the hospital
has all but forgotten Zelig.</i>

410
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,822
<i>Only Dr. Fletcher continues
to fight for his custody.</i>

411
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:17,412
<i>The court turns her final appeal down.</i>

412
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,541
<i>Throughout her valiant legal battle,</i>

413
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:23,955
<i>she is frequently in the company
of her attorney, Charles Koslow.</i>

414
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,667
<i>He falls in love with her
and presses for her hand in marriage.</i>

415
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,259
<i>She is ambivalent.</i>

416
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:36,511
<i>Reluctantly, she is beginning to abandon
all hope of recovering Leonard Zelig.</i>

417
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,385
<i>That summer,
Geist has booked them in Spain.</i>

418
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:47,185
<i>It is the last leg of a European tour
that has been wildly successful.</i>

419
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:52,649
<i>Relations between Martin Geist
and Ruth Zelig have grown strained.</i>

420
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:56,735
<i>They have become bored
with one another, and quarrel frequently.</i>

421
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:01,325
<i>The situation grows worse
when she meets Luis Martinez,</i>

422
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:05,752
<i>a mediocre and cowardly bullfighter
with whom she falls in love.</i>

423
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,346
<i>Though he wishes to impress Ruth Zelig,</i>

424
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:13,721
<i>Martinez displays
his usual panic in the arena.</i>

425
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:18,465
<i>Good fortune is with him, however, as
the bull gives himself a brain concussion.</i>

426
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:22,731
<i>Martinez takes credit for the kill,
and, cutting off the bull's ear,</i>

427
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,693
<i>presents it to his lover
with great bravado.</i>

428
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:31,073
<i>That evening, in a jealous rage,
Martin Geist returns to his hotel room</i>

429
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:35,743
<i>and confronts Ruth Zelig.
He demands that she give him the ear.</i>

430
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:40,197
<i>She refuses. Geist insists
upon possession of the ear.</i>

431
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:44,706
<i>They quarrel furiously, and Martinez
is discovered hiding in the closet.</i>

432
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,214
<i>Geist pulls a revolver and shoots him.</i>

433
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:53,013
<i>He turns the gun on Zelig's half-sister
and kills her, then he takes his own life.</i>

434
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:55,796
<i>In an orgy of jealous violence,</i>

435
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,303
<i>Leonard Zelig's life
is turned upside down.</i>

436
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:18,324
<i>At first, the news reverberates
around the world.</i>

437
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,865
<i>Then, just as quickly, the thrill-hungry
public becomes apathetic.</i>

438
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,293
<i>Fresh scandals appear and make headlines.</i>

439
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:30,666
<i>Events in the Jazz Age
move too rapidly, like Red Grange.</i>

440
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:35,169
<i>A population glutted with distractions
is quick to forget.</i>

441
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:41,966
<i>The '20s come to a crashing climax, and
still Leonard Zelig is nowhere to be found.</i>

442
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:51,146
<i>Dr. Eudora Fletcher
searches in vain to locate him.</i>

443
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:56,441
<i>When several leads prove disappointing,
she gives up, discouraged.</i>

444
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:00,411
I felt it was a shame,
because here was this unique case

445
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,319
that I could make my reputation on.

446
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,163
Not that I knew how to cure him,

447
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:10,829
but if I could have him
alone and feel my way

448
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,090
and be innovative and creative,

449
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,800
I felt that I could change his life,
if I only had the chance.

450
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:31,517
MAN: (ON NEWSREEL) <i>300,000 of the
faithful are waiting before St. Peter's</i>

451
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,814
<i>for the appearance of Pope Pius XI.</i>

452
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:36,230
<i>Borne on the shoulders of 12 attendants,</i>

453
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:39,237
<i>the seat of the gestatoria carrying
the Holy Father</i>

454
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,950
<i>is drawn out to the central balcony,</i>

455
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:44,067
<i>where he bestows his blessing
on Rome and all the world.</i>

456
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:48,198
<i>This is the first time that this ritual
has been performed in 63 years,</i>

457
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:52,791
<i>and brings to a climax on Easter Sunday
the religious ceremonies of Holy Week.</i>

458
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,552
<i>Oh, but what's this?
A commotion next to the Papal Father?</i>

459
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,802
<i>Somebody doesn't belong up there.</i>

460
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:03,185
<i>The guards are summoned amidst
chaos, as His Holiness Pope Pius XI</i>

461
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,810
<i>tries to swat the intruder
with a sacred decree.</i>

462
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,142
<i>The faithful can't believe it.</i>

463
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,314
NARRATOR: <i>It is, of course, Zelig.</i>

464
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:13,903
<i>He is returned to the
United States by Italian authorities</i>

465
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,476
<i>and readmitted to Manhattan Hospital.</i>

466
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:22,496
"I welcome this opportunity
to treat Leonard Zelig,

467
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,321
"now that he's back
as a ward of the hospital.

468
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,741
"I'm grateful that the board
has given me this chance.

469
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:35,132
"I sincerely hope to return him to society
a useful, self-possessed citizen

470
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,801
"no longer a curiosity
with no life of his own."

471
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:42,131
NARRATOR: <i>Dr. Fletcher has
no time now to think of marriage.</i>

472
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:45,343
<i>All her attention
must be devoted to Leonard Zelig.</i>

473
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,469
<i>Her plan is to bring him
to her country home.</i>

474
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,639
<i>She will set up
a neutral environment away from society.</i>

475
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,020
<i>Here, she will begin searching
for some new way to treat him</i>

476
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:00,066
<i>in the hopes of penetrating
his unique malady.</i>

477
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,819
<i>Aware of the significance of her work,</i>

478
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,494
<i>Eudora Fletcher arranges to keep
a filmed record of the proceedings.</i>

479
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:12,285
<i>For this, she contacts
her first cousin, Paul Deghuee,</i>

480
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,582
<i>an inventor and part-time photographer.</i>

481
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:21,416
And she said "I want to make a record
of this case for future generations

482
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,514
"and the world of science,

483
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:26,178
"and I want you
to keep the camera very quiet."

484
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:30,349
And I said, "Why don't you
just take notes and write it up?"

485
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:35,765
She said, "Paul, when a man changes his
physical appearance, you want to see it.

486
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:40,898
"You can't read about it. Besides which,
I am planning to make history."

487
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:46,316
NARRATOR: <i>The "White Room"
is carefully arranged for maximum serenity.</i>

488
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,660
<i>It is a small study in Dr. Fletcher's
house, sparsely furnished.</i>

489
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:57,749
<i>Clumsy photographic lights are nailed to
the wall to provide sufficient illumination.</i>

490
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:03,172
<i>Microphones are hidden
in specially selected places.</i>

491
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:06,126
<i>The camera shoots through a pane of glass</i>

492
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:08,682
<i>which renders it relatively unobtrusive.</i>

493
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,847
<i>Only the noise of the motor is a problem,</i>

494
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,851
<i>but this is muffled with a blanket
and anything else handy.</i>

495
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,860
<i>From this cramped vantage point,
photographer Paul Deghuee</i>

496
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,482
<i>will record
the famous "White Room Sessions, "</i>

497
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,360
<i>a remarkable document
in the history of psychotherapy.</i>

498
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:32,244
By today's standards, the White Room
Sessions would seem very primitive,

499
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,870
and yet they were really quite effective

500
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:40,825
in developing a very strong personal
relation between doctor and patient.

501
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:45,129
The question whether Zelig was a psychotic

502
00:32:45,214 --> 00:32:48,474
or merely extremely neurotic

503
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:53,140
was a question that was endlessly
discussed among us doctors.

504
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,428
Now, I myself felt that, uh...

505
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:01,266
His feelings were really not
all that different from the normal,

506
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:05,612
maybe what one would call
the well-adjusted, normal person,

507
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,861
only carried to an extreme degree,
to an extreme extent.

508
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:16,325
I myself felt that one could really think
of him as the ultimate conformist.

509
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,671
Leonard, do you know why you're here?

510
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,668
To discuss psychiatry, right?

511
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,341
You're a doctor?

512
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:36,058
Yes, I am. I am. Perhaps you've read
my latest paper on delusional paranoia?

513
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,809
Turns out the entire thing is mental.

514
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,602
Now, suppose
I tell you you're not a doctor.

515
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,780
Well, uh...
I would say that you're making a joke.

516
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,207
Is it always so bright in here?

517
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:56,792
Oh, I'm recording these sessions on film,
if you don't mind?

518
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,213
- No. Somebody's behind there, right?
- Mmm-hmm. That's right.

519
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,958
- That's a camera.
- Mmm-hmm.

520
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,915
Leonard... Leonard,
why don't we start with simple reality?

521
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:09,127
- Leonard, you're not a doctor.
- No?

522
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:12,465
No. You're a patient. I'm the doctor.

523
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:17,144
Well, I wouldn't tell that
to too many people if I were you.

524
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,727
Leonard, you're not a doctor.

525
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,895
Is she gonna be all right? 'Cause...
Is this a...

526
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,732
I've gotta get back to town.
Really. I have an interesting case,

527
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:32,357
treating two sets of Siamese twins
with split personalities.

528
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,066
I'm getting paid by eight people.

529
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:39,292
NARRATOR: <i>"The first week's sessions
did not go too well, "</i>

530
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,368
<i>writes Dr. Fletcher in her diary.</i>

531
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:45,962
<i>"Leonard identifies with me and
is convinced that he is a doctor.</i>

532
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,166
<i>"He is guarded and suspicious.</i>

533
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:53,014
<i>"There is something appealing about him,
too. He's quick-witted and energetic.</i>

534
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,429
<i>"Perhaps it is
his very helplessness that moves me.</i>

535
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,599
<i>"I must keep flexible
and play the situation by ear."</i>

536
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,192
How are you today, Leonard?

537
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:10,397
Fine. And I... Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

538
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,526
I gotta get back to town soon. You know,

539
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,855
I teach a course
at the psychiatric institute

540
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:16,909
in masturbation and...

541
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:18,776
- I see.
- I'm a doctor, you know, and I...

542
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,504
"Guilt-related masturbation."

543
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,289
No, no, not guilt-related.
I... I teach advanced.

544
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,879
- I'm quite a respected doctor there.
- Leonard, I'd like you...

545
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:33,632
...eyes follow this pen
and just let yourself breathe deeply.

546
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,841
- Why? What...
- Relax.

547
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:38,637
No.
You're trying to hypnotize me, obviously.

548
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,350
- Do you mind?
- Of course I mind. I'm a doctor. I'm...

549
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,772
- Leonard, you're not a doctor.
- I am a doctor!

550
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:47,362
- Just relax.
- No, I can't. I'm... I'm due back in town.

551
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,567
I... I have this masturbation class.

552
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,729
If I'm not there, they start without me.

553
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,038
NARRATOR: <i>As the weeks go by,</i>

554
00:35:56,113 --> 00:35:58,913
<i>Dr. Fletcher grows more
and more frustrated.</i>

555
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,036
<i>"Leonard continues to insist
he is a doctor,</i>

556
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:05,286
<i>"and even refuses
to let me hypnotize him," she writes.</i>

557
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,509
<i>"I believe his experiences
of the past year</i>

558
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:12,504
<i>"have made him more defensive than ever.
It is discouraging."</i>

559
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,588
She was under great pressure,
you could tell.

560
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:19,298
She was moody and nervous. He was fine.

561
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:24,678
<i>Napping, sitting in his chair reading...
He used to refer to himself as Dr. Zelig.</i>

562
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:27,561
<i>He was reading books on psychiatry.</i>

563
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:30,942
I told her "You'd better
get away for a day and relax.

564
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:33,612
"The strain is becoming too much for you."

565
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:38,276
NARRATOR: <i>Leaving Zelig alone,
Dr. Fletcher takes Paul Deghuee's advice</i>

566
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:42,034
<i>and she and her fiancé
spend some hours off relaxing.</i>

567
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,164
<i>They go to Broadway,
then to a well-known nightclub,</i>

568
00:36:46,246 --> 00:36:51,626
<i>where, despite a lively stage show,
Dr. Fletcher is distracted and uneasy.</i>

569
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,631
<i>She is unable to think
of anything but her patient.</i>

570
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,929
<i>The atmosphere with her fiancé, Koslow,
is awkward and strained.</i>

571
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,505
<i>He is put off
by her total obsession with Zelig.</i>

572
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:07,677
<i>Ironically, it is in the noisy and
smoke-filled atmosphere of the nightclub</i>

573
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:11,808
<i>that Eudora Fletcher is struck
by a brilliant and innovative plan</i>

574
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,776
<i>that will create
a major breakthrough in the case.</i>

575
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,744
- Dr. Zelig?
- Yes?

576
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:29,253
I... I wonder if you could
help me with a problem.

577
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,666
Well, I'll certainly try.

578
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,880
Of course, we can't promise anything,
you know.

579
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:40,261
You see, last week I was with
a group of fairly erudite people

580
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,052
who were discussing the novel <i>Moby Dick,</i>

581
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:46,681
and I... I was afraid to admit
that I hadn't read it, so I lied.

582
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,061
Uh-huh.

583
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:57,902
You see, I want so badly to be liked, to be
like other people so that I don't stand out.

584
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:06,873
- That's natural.
- I go to such extreme lengths to blend in.

585
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,122
Well...

586
00:38:11,665 --> 00:38:13,967
You're a doctor, you know?

587
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,302
You... (CLEARS THROAT)
should know how to handle that.

588
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:19,378
No, but the truth of the matter is,

589
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,880
I... I'm not an actual doctor.

590
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,724
- You're not?
- No, Doctor.

591
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:34,899
No, I've... I've been pretending to be
a doctor to fit in with my friends.

592
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,900
You see, they're doctors.

593
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:40,859
That's...

594
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,571
That's something.

595
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,236
But you're a doctor, and you can help me.
You have to help me.

596
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,828
Actually... I don't feel
that well, actually.

597
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:58,345
But my... My whole life's just been a lie.

598
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,420
I've been posing
as one thing after another.

599
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:04,592
Well, you... You need help, lady. Um...

600
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:10,268
Last night... Last night,
I dreamt that I was falling into fire.

601
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:11,849
What does that mean?

602
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,236
That's terrible. I don't know.
You know, I...

603
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:17,311
Please, Doctor. I know
I'm a very complicated patient.

604
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,817
- Jesus. I don't feel that well.
- What am I suffering from?

605
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,491
How should I know? I'm not a doctor.

606
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,650
- You're not?
- No. Am I?

607
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,735
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am I?

608
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,196
- I don't know. These are tough questions.
- Leonard Zelig.

609
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,709
- Yes, definitely. Who is he?
- You.

610
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,459
No. I'm nobody. I'm nothing.

611
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,588
Catch me, I'm falling.

612
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:43,049
NARRATOR:
<i>Playing on Zelig's identity disorder,</i>

613
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:46,931
<i>Dr. Fletcher has manipulated him
into momentary disorientation.</i>

614
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,432
<i>With his guard lowered,
she quickly puts him under hypnosis.</i>

615
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:55,732
<i>Using posthypnotic suggestion, she will
now be able to induce a trance at will.</i>

616
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,478
My brother beat me.

617
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,188
My sister beat my brother.

618
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:08,065
My father beat my sister
and my brother and me.

619
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:14,831
My mother beat my father
and my sister and me and my brother.

620
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:19,247
The neighbors beat our family.

621
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:25,134
People down the block beat
the neighbors and our family.

622
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,512
I'm 12 years old.

623
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:31,755
I run into a synagogue.

624
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,351
I ask the rabbi the meaning of life.

625
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:39,147
He tells me the meaning of life,

626
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,227
but he tells it to me in Hebrew.

627
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,572
I don't understand Hebrew.

628
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:51,066
Then he wants to charge me $600
for Hebrew lessons.

629
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,406
NARRATOR: <i>Dr. Fletcher's therapy
consists of a two-pronged attack.</i>

630
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:02,379
<i>In the trance state, the personality will
be deeply probed and then restructured.</i>

631
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,550
<i>In the conscious state,
she will provide love and affection,</i>

632
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,183
<i>unconditional positive regard.</i>

633
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,244
You will be completely honest.

634
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,245
You're in a deep trance.

635
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:43,245
You will become, not who you think
I want you to be, but you'll be yourself.

636
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,551
Now, how do you feel about it here?

637
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,548
It's the worst.

638
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,304
I hate the country.

639
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,970
I hate the grass and the mosquitoes.

640
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:02,983
And cooking... Your cooking is terrible.

641
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,685
Your pancakes...

642
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,989
They're... I dump them in the garbage
when you're not looking.

643
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:13,155
- Uh-huh.
- And the jokes you try and tell when...

644
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,830
When you think you're amusing,

645
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:20,463
they're long and pointless,
there's no end to them.

646
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,956
I see. And what else?

647
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,708
I wanna go to bed with you.

648
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:35,301
Oh... That surprises me.

649
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,137
I didn't think you liked me very much.

650
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:40,314
I love you.

651
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:43,729
You do?

652
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:48,015
You're very sweet, 'cause you're...

653
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,686
You're not as clever as you think you are.

654
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,109
You're all mixed up,

655
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,370
and nervous, and you're the worst cook.

656
00:42:57,993 --> 00:42:59,663
Those pancakes...

657
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,870
Oh, I love you.

658
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:04,498
I wanna take care of you.

659
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,340
No more pancakes.

660
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:22,271
FLETCHER: <i>I started out by trying
to use Leonard to make my reputation,</i>

661
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,646
<i>and then I found that
I had very strong feelings for him.</i>

662
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,490
<i>I never thought I was attractive.</i>

663
00:43:28,565 --> 00:43:30,685
<i>I never had a real romance.</i>

664
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:34,279
<i>Charles Koslow was the type of man
my mother felt I should marry.</i>

665
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:43,456
NARRATOR: <i>Feeling more confident
every day with her patient,</i>

666
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,788
<i>Dr. Fletcher takes him
for a cautious outing,</i>

667
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,461
<i>an afternoon at
her sister's house in nearby Teaneck.</i>

668
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:54,552
<i>Meryl Fletcher is an aviatrix,
a fine professional pilot.</i>

669
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:57,892
<i>Eudora Fletcher is an amateur pilot,</i>

670
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:02,893
<i>and the afternoon is spent relaxing
and retelling old flying experiences.</i>

671
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,988
<i>As the weeks pass, Zelig is encouraged</i>

672
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:11,113
<i>to open up more and more,
to give his own opinions.</i>

673
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:15,243
<i>What was guarded at first
soon becomes expansive.</i>

674
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:19,569
ZELIG: <i>I hated my stepmother,
and I don't care who knows it.</i>

675
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,084
<i>I love baseball.</i>

676
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:28,287
<i>You know, it doesn't have to mean
anything, it's just very beautiful to watch.</i>

677
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,803
<i>I'm a Democrat. I always was a Democrat.</i>

678
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:39,552
<i>Is it okay if I don't agree with you
about that recording?</i>

679
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:43,721
- FLETCHER: <i>Of course.</i>
- ZELIG: <i>I mean, Brahms is just always</i>

680
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,387
<i>too melodramatic for me.</i>

681
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:52,907
<i>You have to be your own person
and make your own moral choices,</i>

682
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:58,572
<i>even when they do require real courage,
otherwise you're like a robot, or a lizard.</i>

683
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:02,991
<i>Are you really gonna
get married to that lawyer?</i>

684
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,746
<i>I... I would much rather you didn't.</i>

685
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:11,037
<i>No, I don't agree.
I think this guy Mussolini is a loser.</i>

686
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:16,297
<i>Uh... Are we ever gonna make love?</i>

687
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:21,092
NARRATOR: <i>It has been three months, and
the board wishes to examine the patient.</i>

688
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:24,603
<i>Dr. Fletcher says
Zelig is not ready to leave the premises.</i>

689
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:27,024
<i>The doctors agree to visit him there.</i>

690
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,885
<i>The date is set, four days hence.</i>

691
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:34,942
<i>If progress is insufficient,
she will be removed from the case.</i>

692
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,662
I was very nervous,
because in his waking state

693
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:43,369
he never remembered
anything from his trance state,

694
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,410
and I wondered if there could be some
way of locking these two things together.

695
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:54,502
And then I also was worried
that if he was with strong personalities,

696
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:56,379
he might lose his personality.

697
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,130
NARRATOR:
<i>Sunday at noon. The doctors arrive.</i>

698
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:04,012
<i>They are greeted
by Eudora Fletcher and Leonard Zelig</i>

699
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,847
<i>and are shown around the grounds.</i>

700
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:08,942
<i>Though Dr. Fletcher is tense and alert,</i>

701
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,637
<i>Leonard Zelig seems calm and at ease.</i>

702
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:16,645
<i>Despite the fact that he is surrounded
by physicians, he does not turn into one.</i>

703
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:21,111
<i>The encounter appears
to be a resounding success,</i>

704
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:25,034
<i>when Dr. Henry Mayerson comments
innocently about the weather,</i>

705
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,196
<i>saying that it is a nice day.</i>

706
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:32,617
<i>Zelig tells Dr. Mayerson that
he does not agree that it is a nice day.</i>

707
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,705
<i>Dr. Mayerson is taken aback
at the firmness of Zelig's conviction.</i>

708
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,220
<i>He points out that
the sun is shining and that it is mild.</i>

709
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:48,563
<i>Zelig, trained to voice his own personal
opinions fearlessly, is too aggressive.</i>

710
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:51,677
<i>He has been molded
too far in the other direction.</i>

711
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:53,862
<i>He has become over-opinionated,</i>

712
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:56,607
<i>and cannot brook
any disagreement with his own views.</i>

713
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:00,398
I had taken him
too far in the other direction.

714
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:04,907
He had struck Dr. Mayerson and
several board members with a rake.

715
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:10,115
This was not what we wanted, and yet
I felt that I had accomplished something.

716
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,290
<i>I felt if I could have him for two more
weeks, I could do some fine-tuning</i>

717
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,838
<i>and turn Leonard Zelig
back into his own man.</i>

718
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:32,427
MAN: (ON NEWSREEL)
<i>Dr. Eudora Nesbit Fletcher,</i>

719
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,097
<i>the hero, or should we say heroine,
of the hour.</i>

720
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:39,824
<i>The beautiful and brilliant psychiatrist
never lost faith in her conviction</i>

721
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:43,489
<i>that Leonard Zelig, the human chameleon,
was suffering from a mental disorder.</i>

722
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,905
<i>Working with her cousin,
cameraman Paul Deghuee,</i>

723
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,530
<i>the doctor managed to keep
a vital record of the proceedings</i>

724
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:52,791
<i>including rare footage
of Zelig hypnotized.</i>

725
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,962
<i>The patient and his healer have become
fast friends in the process,</i>

<i>and enjoy one another's company

<i>The result of maintaining
a courageous minority opinion</i>

728

<i>Who says women are just good for sewing?</i>

730

<i>Now it's on to City Hall,</i>

731

732
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:18,561
CITY HALL SPEAKER: We're honored
to present this key to New York City

733
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:19,686
to the two of you.

734
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:26,534
And, uh... Jimmy Walker
did wanna be here this afternoon

735
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:29,446

742
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,719

<i>as she gets to christen her first ship.</i>

746
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,315
<i>Quite a success story
for a little girl from the backwoods.</i>

747
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:11,699
MALE NEWSCASTER: <i>Dr. Fletcher has
smashed the bottle, not champagne...</i>

748
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:15,407
I'm speaking to you from
the home of Mrs. Catherine Fletcher.

749
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,870
She's the mother of Dr. Eudora Fletcher,

750
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:21,668
the famous psychiatrist
so much in the news these days.

751
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:24,883
And I'm going to be
asking Mrs. Fletcher to...

752
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:31,505
To begin with, to tell us something about
what it's like to raise a medical genius.

753
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:35,723
And I might ask you
about the many sacrifices

754
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,558
that you've made to put your daughter
through medical school.

755
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,029
And could you speak
right into the microphones, please?

756
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:44,654
Sacrifices, we had none.
John was a stockbroker,

757
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:48,896
he had plenty of money, and I came
from a wealthy Philadelphia family, so...

758
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,450
Well, I'm sure that your daughter
always wanted to be a doctor,

759
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,027
ever since she could remember.

760
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,084
I don't think so.

761
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:02,915
I always thought she'd want to be a flier
like her sister Meryl and raise a family.

762
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,921
- But she was a very moody...
- But still, a mother always dreams

763
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,796
for her child to have the kind of success
that your daughter has.

764
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:14,219
- She was a very difficult girl.
- Well, tell me about your husband.

765
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:17,104
I understand that
he is a simple businessman.

766
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,181
He must be so thrilled and pleased

767
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,517
to have his daughter
achieve such recognition.

768
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:26,607
John had problems, depression. He drank.

769
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:31,737
Well, Mrs. Fletcher, thank you
so much for speaking with us today.

<i>Oh, and what have we here?</i>

791
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,617
<i>Only a beautiful lady
named Carole Lombard.</i>

792
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,374
<i>And there's Dr. Fletcher and Leonard Zelig</i>

793
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:09,707
<i>hitting a few with Bobby Jones
on Mr. Hearst's golf course.</i>

794

<i>Unless Leonard can go back

<i>and turn into a golf pro,</i>

796
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:18,215
<i>I'd bet my money on Bobby.</i>

797
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,216
<i>But who cares, if they're having fun?</i>

798
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:31,569
Leonard Zelig, do you want to give
the kids of this country some advice?

799
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,744
I sure do. Kids, you gotta be yourself.

800
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,038
You know, you can't act like anybody else

801
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:40,073
just because you think that they have
all the answers and you don't.

802
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:44,163
You have to be your own man and learn
to speak up and say what's on your mind.

803
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:47,121
Now, maybe they're not free
to do that in foreign countries,

804
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:48,876
but that's the American way.

805
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,960
And you can take it from me, because I
used to be a member of the reptile family,

806
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:54,835
but I'm not anymore.

<i>I'm singin' a song</i>

<i>Just singin' a song</i>

813
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,993
<i>Glory, hallelujah, I told Leonard Zelig</i>

814

<i>Hey, Len, get ready to call</i>

815

<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty, I'm ready to fall</i>

816
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:32,792
<i>I'm sittin' on top of the world</i>

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,630
<i>My, my, my, rollin' along</i>

818
00:53:36,923 --> 00:53:39,933
<i>Rollin' along</i>

819
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:44,558
NARRATOR: <i>Zelig, no longer a chameleon,
is at last his own man.</i>

820
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:50,651
<i>His point of view on politics, art,
life and love is honest and direct.</i>

821
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:56,072
<i>Though his taste is described
by many as lowbrow, it is his own.</i>

822
00:53:56,984 --> 00:54:00,074
<i>He is finally an individual,
a human being.</i>

823
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,414
<i>He no longer gives up his own identity</i>

824
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:05,240
<i>to be a safe and invisible
part of his surroundings.</i>

825
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:07,372
Oh, his taste wasn't terrible.

826
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:12,670
He was the kind of man who preferred
watching baseball to reading <i>Moby Dick.</i>

827
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,500
And that got him off on the wrong foot,
or so the legend goes.

828
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:22,090
It was much more a matter of symbolism.
To the Marxists, he was one thing.

829
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:27,353
The Catholic Church never
forgave him for the Vatican incident.

830
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:32,728
The American people, in the throes
of the Depression as they were,

831
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:38,188
found in him a symbol of possibility,
of self-improvement and self-fulfillment.

832
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:40,531
And of course, the Freudians had a ball.

833
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:44,073
They could interpret him
in any way they pleased.

834
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,833
It was all symbolism,
but there were no two intellectuals

835
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,952
who agreed about what it meant.

836
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:53,538
I don't know if you could call it
a triumph of psychotherapy.

837
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,294
It seems more like
a triumph of aesthetic instincts,

838
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:59,457
because Dr. Fletcher's
techniques didn't owe anything to

839
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:01,795
then-current schools of therapy.

840
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,393
But she sensed what was needed
and she provided it,

841
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,140
and that was, in its way,
a remarkable creative accomplishment.

842
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,728
When I think about it,
it seems to me that his story

843
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:15,149
reflected a lot of
the Jewish experience in America,

844
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:18,866
the great urge to push in
and to find one's place

845
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:21,651
and then to assimilate into the culture.

846
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,359
I mean, he wanted
to assimilate like crazy.

847
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,739
<i>(SUNNY SIDE UP</i> PLAYING)

It was wonderful to see
my sister and Leonard together.

868
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:58,174
She drew strength from him,

and they were so much
in love with each other.

00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,596
and then, of course, the roof fell in.

873
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:21,438
NARRATOR: <i>Two weeks before the wedding,</i>

874
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:25,032
<i>an ex-showgirl named Lita Fox comes forth</i>

875
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,069
<i>and claims that she is married to Zelig.</i>

876
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:31,488
<i>She also claims to have had his child.</i>

877
00:57:32,116 --> 00:57:34,196
<i>It is an immediate scandal.</i>

878
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:41,462
We were married a year ago.
He said he was an actor.

879
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:45,586
He sounded just like one,
and I'm in show business, too.

880
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:49,593
So we drove to Baltimore
and we were married,

881
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,684
and I have a license to prove it.

882
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,640
NARRATOR: <i>He had married her while
under a different personality.</i>

883
00:57:56,515 --> 00:58:00,095
<i>When she read of the plans for his
forthcoming wedding to Eudora Fletcher,</i>

884
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:03,478
<i>she was mortified
and decided to take legal action.</i>

885
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,438
<i>Zelig says he will fight it in court,</i>

886
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:09,951
<i>but public opinion begins
subtly to shift away from him.</i>

887
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:15,703
<i>Clever attorneys portray Lita Fox
as an abandoned woman.</i>

888
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:19,038
<i>The child is neglected,
poor and fatherless.</i>

889
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:23,712
<i>Zelig has sold his life story to Hollywood
for a large sum of money.</i>

890
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:27,842
<i>When the scandal breaks,
the studio demands its money back.</i>

891
00:58:28,756 --> 00:58:32,636
<i>Zelig can only return half
as the rest has already been spent.</i>

892
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:38,604
<i>Outraged, the studio gives him half his
life back. They keep the best moments,</i>

893
00:58:39,099 --> 00:58:42,439
<i>and he is left with only
his sleeping hours and mealtimes.</i>

894
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:47,105
<i>Zelig is shaken by the scandal,
but it is only the beginning.</i>

895
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:50,369
<i>Now another woman steps forward.</i>

896
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,614
<i>Helen Gray, a salesgirl
from a Wisconsin gift shop</i>

897
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,911
<i>claims that Zelig
is the father of her twins.</i>

898
00:58:57,451 --> 00:59:00,791
<i>She tells her lawyers that he passed
himself off as a fur trapper.</i>

899
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:03,746
<i>Zelig has no recollection,</i>

900
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:07,420
<i>but admits it could have happened
when he was under one of his spells.</i>

901
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,505
<i>It is the signal
for the floodgates to open.</i>

902
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:14,013
He married me up
at the First Church of Harlem.

903
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,795
He told me he was
the brother of Duke Ellington.

904
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,980
He was the guy who smashed my car up.
It was brand-new.

905
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,900
Then he backed up over my mother's wrist.

906
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:30,187
She's elderly, and uses her wrist a lot.

907
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,235
He painted my house a disgusting color.

908
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:36,824
He said he was a painter.

909
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:41,158
I couldn't believe the results.
Then he disappeared.

910
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,536
NARRATOR: <i>That Zelig could be
responsible for the behavior</i>

911
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,833
<i>of each of the personalities he assumed</i>

912
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,207
<i>means dozens of lawsuits.</i>

913
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:53,507
<i>He is sued for bigamy,
adultery, automobile accidents,</i>

914
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:56,602
<i>plagiarism, household damages, negligence,</i>

915
00:59:56,677 --> 01:00:00,427
<i>property damages, and performing
unnecessary dental extractions.</i>

916
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,227
I would like to apologize to everyone.

917
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:07,350
I'm awfully sorry
for marrying all those women.

918
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:10,518
It just... I don't know,
it just seemed like the thing to do.

919
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:14,947
And to the gentleman
whose appendix I took out,

920
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,949
I'm... I don't know what to say.

921
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:20,991
If it's any consolation, I may still
have it somewhere around the house.

922
01:00:23,037 --> 01:00:26,247
My deepest apology goes
to the Trokman family in Detroit.

923
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,541
I... I never delivered a baby before
in my life,

924
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:35,088
and I, I just thought
that ice tongs was the way to do it.

925
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:39,972
NARRATOR: <i>Thriving mercilessly
on loopholes and technicalities,</i>

926
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:42,894
<i>the American legal profession
has a field day.</i>

927
01:00:43,432 --> 01:00:47,732
<i>Zelig is branded a criminal.
Despite Dr. Fletcher's insistence</i>

928
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,197
<i>that he cannot be held
responsible for his actions</i>

929
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:53,282
<i>while in his chameleon state,
it is no use.</i>

930
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:57,491
WOMAN:
<i>Leonard Zelig sets a bad moral influence.</i>

931
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:03,485
<i>America is a moral country.
It's a God-fearing country.</i>

932
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,910
We don't condone scandals,

933
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:10,418
scandals of fraud and polygamy.

934
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,250
In keeping with a pure society,

935
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:18,049
I say lynch the little Hebe!

936
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,847
NARRATOR:
<i>Throughout the humiliating ordeal,</i>

937
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:25,429
<i>Eudora Fletcher stands by
the man she loves, valiantly.</i>

938
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:31,269
<i>Privately, she tells friends that she is
worried about Zelig's emotional condition,</i>

939
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:33,741
<i>which seems to her to be deteriorating</i>

940
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:36,106
<i>under the weight of
conservative moral opinion.</i>

941
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:40,776
<i>In public, he tries to keep up
an appearance of composure,</i>

942
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,659
<i>but it is increasingly difficult.</i>

943
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:48,294
<i>It is clear he is coming apart when he and
Eudora Fletcher dine at a Greek restaurant,</i>

944
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:52,459
<i>and in the midst of the meal,
Zelig begins to turn Greek.</i>

945
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:04,098
<i>He longs desperately to be liked
once again, to be accepted, to fit in.</i>

946
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,640
<i>Public clamor over his morality
reaches a fever pitch,</i>

947
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:13,306
<i>and on the eve of his sentencing,
Leonard Zelig vanishes.</i>

948
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:24,073
<i>This is Chief Inspector
of Police Thomas Dowd</i>

949
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,371
<i>with a national broadcasting news break.</i>

950
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:29,705
<i>Leonard Zelig is missing.
On the eve of his sentencing</i>

951
01:02:30,122 --> 01:02:32,832
<i>for an assortment
of crimes and misdemeanors</i>

952
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,540
<i>ranging from polygamy to fraud,</i>

953
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:37,596
<i>he has disappeared.</i>

954
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:41,341
<i>We are searching for clues and
would appreciate speaking with anyone</i>

955
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:44,932
<i>who might have any information
leading to his apprehension.</i>

956
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,180
MERYL: <i>My sister was just shattered.</i>

957
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:54,690
<i>She tried, you know, she tried to keep up
a calm front but she was just too upset.</i>

958
01:02:56,064 --> 01:03:00,614
<i>And she wasn't a person
who usually displayed emotion easily,</i>

959
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,490
<i>except where Leonard was concerned.</i>

960
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:10,453
NARRATOR:
<i>Dr. Fletcher and the police confer daily.</i>

961
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:11,964
<i>Together they make public appeals</i>

962
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:13,959
<i>to anyone who might know
of his whereabouts.</i>

963
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:18,875
<i>Apart from several crank telephone calls,
there is little response.</i>

964
01:03:19,671 --> 01:03:22,551
<i>Months go by and Zelig is not heard from.</i>

965
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:26,681
<i>Cars are searched.
False leads pour in from everywhere.</i>

966
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,523
<i>His jacket is recovered in Texas.</i>

967
01:03:29,598 --> 01:03:32,228
<i>A manhunt in that state proves futile.</i>

968
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:36,188
<i>He is reported seen
in Chicago, in California.</i>

969
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:40,200
<i>This still photo appears
to have a man resembling him</i>

970
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:42,315
<i>with a mariachi band in Mexico.</i>

971
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,580
<i>Dr. Fletcher continues
to search for Zelig,</i>

972
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,291
<i>but hopes fade with each passing day.</i>

973
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:54,578
FLETCHER: <i>All I could think of was Leonard</i>

974
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:57,419
<i>and how much I missed him and loved him,</i>

975
01:03:58,252 --> 01:04:01,172
<i>and of all the terrific times
we'd spent together.</i>

976
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:04,764
<i>It was really a very painful time for me.</i>

977
01:04:06,093 --> 01:04:09,723
NARRATOR:
<i>The year ends, and Zelig is still missing.</i>

978
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,020
I just moped around and wept.

979
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:18,734
And one night, after a very bad time,

980
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:22,534
my sister Meryl said to me,
"Come on, let's go out for dinner.

981
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,036
"Let's go to a concert."

982
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:27,451
I said, "No, I can't do it."
But she insisted.

983
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:30,698
And we went out
and finally ended up in a movie.

984
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:34,538
<i>We saw</i> Grand Hotel
<i>and with it, there was a newsreel.</i>

985
01:04:44,882 --> 01:04:47,559
MAN: (ON NEWSREEL) <i>Adolf Hitler
and the National Socialist Party</i>

986
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:50,804
<i>continue to consolidate gains
in Depression-ridden Berlin.</i>

987
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:53,398
<i>Denouncing the Treaty of Versailles,</i>

988
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:57,736
<i>the Nazis make fervent appeals to German
patriotism, promising to rebuild...</i>

989
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,811
NARRATOR: <i>Eudora Fletcher
is stunned by what she sees.</i>

990
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:05,646
<i>Amongst the Brownshirts,
she spots a figure who could be Zelig.</i>

991
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:09,533
Yes, but then it really made sense,
it made all the sense in the world,

992
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:14,536
because although he wanted to be loved,
craved to be loved,

993
01:05:14,703 --> 01:05:17,003
there was also something in him

994
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,500
that desired immersion
in the mass and anonymity,

995
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:25,383
<i>and fascism offered Zelig
that kind of opportunity.</i>

996
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:28,926
<i>So he could make something
anonymous of himself</i>

997
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,720
<i>by belonging to this vast movement.</i>

998
01:05:34,348 --> 01:05:36,598
NARRATOR:
<i>She sails for Europe the following week.</i>

999
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:40,152
<i>Ten days later, she arrives in Berlin.</i>

1000
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:44,194
<i>Germany is a country deep
in the throes of the Depression.</i>

1001
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:47,189
<i>Militarism and unrest are in the air.</i>

1002
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:51,695
<i>She searches everywhere and makes
enquiries, but it is impossible.</i>

1003
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:56,536
<i>After three weeks,
the authorities begin to get suspicious.</i>

1004
01:05:56,954 --> 01:06:00,254
<i>They watch her. While she is out,
they search her hotel room.</i>

1005
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:05,375
<i>A fourth week goes by,
and she is about to give up and go home,</i>

1006
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:09,012
<i>when news of a large rally
at Munich catches her attention.</i>

1007
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:14,845
<i>It is rumored that it will be the largest
gathering to date of Nazi personnel.</i>

1008
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:20,481
<i>Eudora Fletcher is counting on
the hope that Zelig may also attend.</i>

1009
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,230
<i>And that if she can confront him,</i>

1010
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:26,022
<i>the strong feeling he has
always had for her can be awakened.</i>

1011
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:31,994
<i>At first, all appears hopeless.
The crowd is huge,</i>

1012
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:35,584
<i>and it seems impossible
to locate any one particular face.</i>

1013
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:39,751
(SPEAKING IN GERMAN)

1014
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:52,351
NARRATOR: <i>Then, suddenly,</i>

1015
01:06:52,426 --> 01:06:55,176
<i>a figure flanking
the Chancellor captures her attention.</i>

1016
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:59,432

was his ability to transform himself.

Therefore, his sickness
was also at the root of his salvation,
