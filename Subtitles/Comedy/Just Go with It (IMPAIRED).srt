00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm so happy you picked this dress, Veruca!

2
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
You look beautiful. Doesn't she?

3
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,800
You guys, I'm getting married!

4
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,600
I'm getting married!

5
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,280
Not without your veil, you're not.

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
Where is that bad boy?

7
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,080
Oh, I think I left it upstairs.

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,920
Don't worry. I'll get it,

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,680
sis.

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,360
She is so annoying.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,040
And so ugly.

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
She looks like Karl Malden.

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,280
I know, and she's gonna be

14
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
my sister-in-law in an hour!

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,160
COLBY: How are you gonna deal with that?

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,120
VERUCA: I'm just gonna lay down the law for Danny.

17
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,800
We're seeing his goofy family as little as possible.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,440
DANA: You sure he's gonna go along with that?

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,640
VERUCA: (SCOFFS) Danny doesn't say no to me.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,880
Believe me, I have him well-trained.

(WOMEN LAUGHING)

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
So, tell us, what happened with Eric last night?

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,320
(SHUSHING)

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,520
So, I told him if he wanted to stop the wedding,

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,160
he had to speak now or forever hold his peace.

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,680
And what'd he say?

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,240
He said he's never gonna settle down,

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
and I should just go ahead and marry Danny.

29

(ALL EXCLAIM)

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,080
Did he give you a wedding present, huh?

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,480
You're so horny! Yeah.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,240
I guess you could call it that.

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,680
DANA: You're so bad!

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
(SHUSHING) It's the last time, I swear.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,160
Yeah, right!

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,680
Danny is so sweet and considerate.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,760
And he's gonna be a cardiologist.

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,680
So, I'm marrying him

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,680
and that zucchini in the middle of his face.

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,320

42

DANA: And your thighs!

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Cuz, I'm so sorry.

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,840
DANNY: Yikes, that hurt.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,800
That was me, Danny Maccabee, 20 years ago.

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,960
Pathetic, huh?

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

Hey, mami!

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,400
You must play the trumpet or something,

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,640
'cause you're making me feel all horny and stuff!

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,280
You dropped your purse.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,840
Can I just sit for 10 seconds

58
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,160
and not get hit on? Thank you.

59
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,920
I was just letting you know you dropped your purse.

60

(GROANS)

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,240
I'm sorry. I thought... That's fine, that's fine.

62
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,840
I'm sure you didn't meet the
lady who gave you that ring

63
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,720
in a meat market like this.

64
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,440
School cafeteria.

65
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,560
How long you been married?

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
DANNY: I was gonna tell her, I really was.

67
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,520
But I didn't want her to know what a loser I was,

68
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,160
so I stretched the truth a little.

69
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Six years.

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,160
Where's your wife tonight?

71
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,240
I stopped asking that question a long time ago.

72
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,040
That's terrible.

73
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,800
My wife says I work too much.

74
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,320
Trying to provide for her, her shopping addiction,

75
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,800
and crack.

76
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,640
Why don't you just leave her?

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,600
The children.

78
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,440
All 14 of them.

79
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,000
I just, I like to adopt,

80
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,440
and I don't wanna stop doing that.

81
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,640
You poor guy.

82
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,800
You wanna get outta here?

83
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,760
DANNY: And so I discovered

84
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,680
the power of the wedding ring.

85
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,440
The symbol of my humiliation

86
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,960
had become a tool to get back on the horse.

87
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,800
Are you kidding me? Snuffleupagus!

88
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,400
I switched my specialty from
cardiology to plastic surgery,

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,320
got rid of the big honker,

90
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,880
and the ring became my thing.

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,320
I just assumed after we got married
she'd stop hooking, but...

92
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,120
You need to put this wedding band on a true heart.

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,720
This is a good moment.

94
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah. Should we go make it last,

95
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,720
for a while, somewhere?

96
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,800
Okay, let's go. To your dorm.

97
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680
DANNY: Sometimes I think about

98
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
throwing the ring into the ocean.

99
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,880
I know how wrong it is. But I can't.

100

(MIMICKING GOLLUM) It's my Precious.

101
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,760
Besides, being fake married

102
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,480
is the perfect way to make sure

103
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,520
I never get my heart broken again.

104
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,360
What are these?

105
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,600
(EXHALES)

106
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,760
Boobie bags.

107
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,080
The women, they stick them in their flat chesties,

108
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,160
make them big.

109
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,200
These are not the boobie bags that I ordered.

110
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
What is that?

111
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,280
It's like a syrup dispenser at an IHOP.

112
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
I don't know what that is.

113
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,240
Come on. These, they don't feel like these.

114
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,040
No... Seriously?

I just trying to learn.

116
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,320
Listen, Dr. Maccabee would
never accept subpar boobs.

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,200
Would you please just get me what I ordered

118
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,840
and tell Omar that I would like a
discount for the inconvenience?

119
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,880
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Simon.

120

(SIGHING)

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,800
Well, I, uh... I had bad plastic surgery.

124
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,920
Should've known this doctor was a quack.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,960
His office was in, like, a warehouse.

126
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
I see, I see.

127
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Questions?

128
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,480
No, no. Just, please help me, Doctor.

129
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,880
Absolutely. It's usually easier

130
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,640
to do these things right the first time, but...

131
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
What? You seem dubious.

132
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Hmm?

133
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,200
Oh, no, not at all.

134
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
I mean, I hear you're the best, Dr. Maccabee.

135
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't know about that,

136
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,920
but I think we can figure something out here.

137
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
Relax, relax.

138
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,400
That's relaxed? Hmm.

139
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,360
Here, let me just pull it down for a sec.

140
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,760
And I let go. Okay, shoots right
back up there. (SNICKERS)

141
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm sorry. Oh. Sorry about what?

142
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
Oh, my God! It's just...

143
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,640
That just really went right up there.

144
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
That was high. You gotta watch that.

145
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
It's gonna get caught in your hair.

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,200
I don't know, maybe I should just keep it like this.

147
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,800
It seems to make other people happy.

148
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,320
No. But, seriously, are you available
for my kid's birthday party?

149
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
(LAUGHING)

150
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,040
DANNY: That's too much. I'm sorry!

151
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Let me give you a hug.

152
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,120
That's what you need first. We'll fix this.

153
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,480
Mmm.

154
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,960
Oh, God! Okay, I gotta...

155
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm gonna excuse myself. I'm sorry.

Eddie's here. Hey. My cousin.

158
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,600
Oh.

159
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, my gosh.

160
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,160
Brows gone wild over here.

161
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm actually digging it.

162
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,560
And what are you doing later?

163
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,680
(LAUGHS) Oh!

164
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,080
Oh, sorry, I'm kind of seeing
anybody else. There you go.

165
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,800
Oh, browch. (LAUGHS)

166
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,080
My gosh.

167
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,640
Look, I don't know who you're seeing,

168
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,040
but whoever they are,

169
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,080
they don't have what this guy's got down
there, you know what I mean?

170
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,440
All right, Eddie.

171
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,480
Yeah, it's a very good one. I should know, I installed it.

172
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,080
Oh, you had a penile enlargement?

173
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,440
Yes.

174
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,200
People really do that? That is hilarious!

175
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,880
See you on the 28th, Dr. Maccabee!

176
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,600
Dude, why are you telling everybody
about my surgery?

177
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,480
Am I hiding the secrets around here?

178
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,960
You don't think Katherine knows about this?

179
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,920
Katherine was in the room when I did that.

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,560
She held the magnifying glass.

181
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,280
I did. And the tweezer.

182
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,720
Real nice.

183
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,320
Did you get a chance to try it out yet?

184
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,480
Uh, yeah. I've banged it up.

185
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,720
It's got a couple dents. I'm not gonna lie.

186
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,760
Yeah. You did?

187
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,640
Not from a human.

188
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,400
It's got... From this doll I made.

189
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,920
Oh.

(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

191
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,480
Hey, Adon. Yo, yo.

192
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,920
Danny! I am so happy you could be here!

193
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,800
How are you, baby? Did you bring any Botox?

194
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,200
I didn't bring the Botox. I brought my cousin, Eddie.

195
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,840
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

196
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,280
Is this a Halloween party?

197
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you kidding me right now?

198
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,280
You got a little more work done, huh?

199
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,360
Yeah, just a little bit, just tweaking, tweaking.

200
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,960
Maintenance, maintenance.

201
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,200
I just wanna stay in the game, Danny.

202
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,800
I don't wanna hit home runs,
just some singles. That's all.

203
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
You gotta stop, though, I'm telling you.

204
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,160
Do you have any feeling in your face?

205
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
Just in this one spot right here.

206
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,160
And then from the eyebrows down, dead, dead.

He's laughing, he's laughing. Oh, okay.

210
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,440
I wanted to go to your cousin Danny here,

211
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,000
but he refused to do any work.

212
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,640
He didn't wanna put his fingers in the pie. Ooh!

213
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
It was getting dangerous. This amount...

214
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,840
You gotta slow it down.

215
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,800
Okay, see? That shouldn't be happening right now.

Adon! Adon, Adon, Adon!

Ariel cut open his knee. It looks awful.

What happened? Settle, settle.

219
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
What do you expect me to do about it?

220
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,840
It's bleeding. You know what? I could stitch him up.

221
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,560
Why don't you go get me my bag? All right.

222
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,800
So, you fell down the stairs, huh?

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,160
Yeah.

224
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,320
Mmm-hmm.

225
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,880
Did you trip over something?

226
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,360
Was there a skateboard there, or...

227
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,920
No, I was distracted by something.

228
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,560
What distracted you?

229
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,800
A girl.

230
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,680
A girl, okay. Was it your mother?

231

No!

232
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,320
'Cause she just looks good.

233
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,760
That's your stepmom. I can talk like that.

234
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
All right. This is lidocaine. Don't think about it.

(GROANS) Ow!

236
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Don't think about it. Think about your face.

00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,920
Good, good.

238
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,520
Blonde, brunette, redhead?

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,440
Blonde, tan, tall, rocking body.

241
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,000
Want me to numb something else for you?

242
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,360
You're getting a little nutty over there.

243

(EXCLAIMS) No! No, I'm good. I'm good.

Good job, Doctor. That was really nice.

246
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,640
The distraction, I'm guessing.

247
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
The what?

248
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,520
The boy was distracted. That's why he fell.

So, I'm taking the rap for this.

250

Yes. Your hotness basically pushed
him down the stairs.

Good luck proving that in court, Wisengruber.

252
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
Wisengruber? Is that what they're saying

253
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,640
on the Gossip Girl nowadays?

254
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,000
I knew you two would eventually find each other!

255
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,880
But be careful, Palmer, these plastic surgeons,

256
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,280
they really know how to operate.

(STRAINED LAUGHING)

258

Yeah, all right, Adon. All right.

259
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,360
PALMER: I just don't know about plastic surgery.

260
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
I mean, doesn't it always look so fake?

261
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
Depends who's doing it. I'm pretty
good at it. I'm telling you.

262
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Some of my patients are here tonight. Oh, really?

263
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,520
Really, really. Look around,

264
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,000
see if you can find someone decent-looking.

265
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,160
How 'bout her?

266
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
The lady from Saw?

267
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,320
Fine. Who did you do?

268
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,440
All right. I hate to rat the guy out,

269
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,360
but see that guy over there?

270
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
You mean Sexy Ass?

271
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Before I met him, he was No Buns Bobby.

00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,200
Really?

273
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,400
His back went straight to his legs. No kidding.

274
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
He'd go to the bathroom,

275
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,720
he'd slide right in the toilet.

276
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,320
I know, I know, that's really romantic, isn't it?

277
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,000
So, North Carolina, how long
have you lived here in LA?

278
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,520
I've been here almost two years.

279
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,040
Uh-huh. That's a lot of auditioning for you.

280
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,640
You think I'm an actress?

281
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,040
I guarantee you're an actress.

282
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,880
Well, guess again, Doc. I teach sixth grade math.

283
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,200
They got no schools in North Carolina to teach at?

284
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,680
My parents divorced.

285
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,120
Had a pretty nasty one, actually,

286
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,760
when I was in the eighth grade. Mmm-hmm.

287
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,320
And... I don't know. I got tired of picking sides, so...

288
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,840
Okay. I thought I'd make a change
and, yeah, move out to LA.

289
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,680
You came to the right place.
No one gets divorced in LA.

290
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,000
Mmm-hmm.

291
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,720
I've never hung out with a girl your age. This is nice.

292
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,960
Oh, no. Your first lie to me.

293
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,360
You're good. All right.

294
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,720
I've never hung out with a girl your age and

295
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,720
connected the way we are right now.

296
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,040
Actually, I've never connected with,

297
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,080
I don't think any girl at any age.

298
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,160
See? I can tell when you're lying

299
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,280
and when you're telling the truth. Oh.

300
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah. The second thing I said was the truth.

301
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,720
I know.

302
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,040
Oh, my God. That was the greatest night of my life.

303
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,280
Yeah. This feels like it could be...

304
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,760
I don't know, a real thing.

305
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,400
It's a thing all right, Palmer.

306
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,360
Well, I have to get to work,

307
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,760
but how 'bout I take your number

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,120
and then you can take me out
on a proper date next time?

309
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,320
I got a business card in my pocket
if you wanna get that.

310
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,640
You better call. (LAUGHING)

311
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,840
You better not just, just leave me hanging.

312
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,880
I'd get it for you myself,

313
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,040
but I don't want you to see me naked in the daylight.

314
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,000
It could be a deal breaker.

315
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,320
What's this?

316
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,120
A circle?

317
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,920
A wedding ring? You're married?

318
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,320
No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not married.

319
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,600
That is a... That is... That's not mine.

320
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,000
Whose wedding ring is in your pants, Danny?

321
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,120
All right, listen, just give me a minute to explain this.

322
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,520
Please.

323
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,840
It's gonna take more than a minute.

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,360
I am such an idiot!

325
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,640
No, no, no, no, no.

326
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,560
Don't call me!

327
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,280

329
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,560
I told you that this whole fake marriage thing

330
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,560
was just gonna come and bite you in the ass.

331

Why don't you just tell her the truth?

You think I can tell her the truth?

333
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,960
Let me practice. You be her right now.

334

Oh, good. Okay, hold on.

335
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,240
Okay. She's not like that, but anyways.

336
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,240
Um, I wear this fake wedding ring sometimes...

337

Sorry. You're a pig.

What's wrong? You're walking really weird.

342
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,000
God Almighty.

343
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,920
When are you gonna strengthen your spine?

344
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,720
Seriously, Flomax.

345
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,720
You gotta work out more than once a month.

346
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,320
I can't, I don't have time to work out.

347
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,920
You do. You can't say that, Danny.

348
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,160
My mother always said Cary Grant
never went to the gym.

349
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,240
Only took the stairs, every day, never an elevator.

350
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,840
You wanna hear my impression
of Cary Grant's butler? Nuh-uh.

351
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,960
Watch. What?

352
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,360
Hello? No, he's dead.

353
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,120
Okay, bye-bye.

354
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,880
That's good. That's funny.

355
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,240
Mom, give me some money.

356
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
Hi. How are you?

357
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,040
Nice to see you, kids.

358
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,080
Please be polite and say hello to Dr. Maccabee.

359
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,600
(IN ENGLISH ACCENT) 'Ello, Dr. Danny.

360
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
'Ow is you today?

361
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,960
Is that my associate, Dr. Doolittle?

362
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,240
Why is she talking like that?

363
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,400
She's been working on some accents.

364
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,640
I am takin' an acting class this summer, I is.

365
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,360
Gonna be the next Miley Cyrus, I am.

366
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,960
How 'bout you, young man? Do
you like Hannah Montana?

367
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,960
No. I like Californication.

368
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,800
When do you ever watch Californication?

369
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,960
Rosa lets us watch Showtime
when she calls her boyfriend.

370
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,160
Eat the mushroom! Eat the mushroom! Yes!

371
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,880
Mmm. You run a tight ship at home, huh?

372
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,240
MICHAEL: Dr. Danny?

373
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,560
Yeah?

374
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,400
Will you take me to Hawaii so
I can swim with the dolphins?

375
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,000
Take you to Hawaii? No.

376
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,680
I saw a show on the Discovery Channel.

377
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,760
They say in Hawaii they have dolphins

378
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,440
that you can swim with if you pay money.

379
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Okay.

380
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,640
But I don't have any money. And
my mom says you're rich.

381
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,640
Michael! No, it's fine.

382
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,840
Maybe you should make your own money.

383
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,000
Maybe a paper route or something like that?

384
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,800
'Cause rich people don't give other people trips.

385
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
That's why they remain rich. You understand?

386
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,480
But my mom says you do charity for kids all the time.

387
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,960
I do charity work like I fix a cleft
lip or a child's deformity.

388
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,080
I don't take them to Hawaii.
I could get arrested for that.

389
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,520
What if I was deformed? Then
would you take me to Hawaii?

390
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,080
If you were deformed, I'd bring you to Hawaii,

391
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
but I'd leave you there, 'cause
I wouldn't want to look at you.

392
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,640
Okay. Here's the money, and I want change.

393
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,920
And I wanna hear back

394
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,040
that you actually ate the food that I am paying for.

395
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,480
Mom, before we go, can I make a Devlin?

396
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,200
Sure. Down the hall. Will you please go with him?

397
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,040
We open in five minutes and I am
not having him sit there forever.

398
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Bloody hell right, I will, Mumsy!

399
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,360
All right, Winston Churchill.

400
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,800
He said, "I gotta make a Devlin."

401
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
What does that mean? Uh...

402
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,400
It's just a friend of mine who
was in my sorority in college

403
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,920
named Devlin Adams, and...

404
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,320
Well, I wouldn't say friend. I'd say more my nemesis.

405
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,560
Oh, so she was a frenemy? Yes.

406
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,360
You'd probably like her. She's really, really fake.

407
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,520
Ah.

408
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,360
Always had to have the coolest clothes

409
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,080
and the hottest boys and, you know...

410
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,320
She bothers you. A lot.

411
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,040
So, one night, I was just having a glass of wine.

412
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,000
A bottle. A bottle.

413
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,280
And, uh...

414
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,520
And I just got so tired of the kids saying things like,

415
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,920
"I gotta take a crap.

416
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,520
"I gotta take a dump."

417
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,800
So, I told them that it was called "making a Devlin,"

418
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,280
and they liked it.

419
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
And it stuck.

420
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,840
I always call it making a black pickle.

421
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,680
Making a what? I don't say that.

422
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
Out loud? Good. To others. No.

423
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,600
What are we gonna do about my love life, though?

424
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,880
Oh, Danny, I would feel terrible for you if I had any,

425
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200

Holy Devlin, you're not listening to me.

428
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,040
This is like not some bull-Devlin fling.

I mean, I'm serious.

430
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,280
This is the real Devlin. I could...

431
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
I swear to God, I could see myself
ending up with this girl.

432
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,080
Oh.

433
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,200
You're right. You can't tell her the truth.

434
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,480
High score!

435
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,440
Oh, God. Sorry.

You know what? You don't wanna get serious,

to pick them up today.

But you know what?

445
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,000
At least I got my head together and I divorced him.

You mean her first name? Her first name is Devlin.

Her name's Devlin?

But Devlin and I are splitting up, fortunately,

because it's too painful.

489
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,200
They actually burned the tape so you can't see it.

490
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,920
But I would love you to.

491
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,920
There's another man?

492
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,920
There's another guy, yes. Dolph.

493
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,560
Dolph?

494
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,440
Dolph Lundgren. Yeah.

495
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,120
Like the guy from Rocky IV?

496
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,840
No, no, a different Dolph Lundgren.

497
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,280
Apparently, if you bring that one up,

498
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,800
this one gets really angry, so don't.

499
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,880
Danny, guys always say they're
gonna leave their wives.

500
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,040
They never do.

501
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,280
I'm telling you, she's happy with this Dolph guy,

502
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
good for her. Now I wanna be happy.

503
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,880
And the only way I can be happy is if I'm with you!

504
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,040
All right?

505
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,480
Just wanna be able to be with you

506
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,320
and not be called a "fornicator"

507
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
or an "adulterer" or whatever that

508
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,920
Children of the Corn kid was calling me.

509
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,640
Okay.

510
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,800
Okay?

511
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,800
I just need to hear it from her.

512
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,240
How about if she texts you, would that be good?

513
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,720
I need to meet her.

514
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,920
Let's do it.

515
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,480
KATHERINE: You want me to be
your wife? DANNY: Uh-huh.

516
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,600
And you couldn't think of another
name, other than Devlin?

517
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,280
I practically took a Devlin in my
pants when she asked me.

518
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,480
"What's her name?" I got panicked.

519
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,600
I get nervous around this girl.

520
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,840
You got panicked?

521
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,080
You who invents a fake wife every Friday night?

522
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,360
Yeah. Doesn't that say something

523
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,640
about what I feel about this girl?

524
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,920
Have you ever thought about the time

525
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,840
that she's actually gonna walk
into your office... Uh-huh.

526
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,000
...and sees that I'm your assistantlreceptionist?

527
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,840
So easy. I'm a plastic surgeon,

528
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,280
you will never look like you again.

529
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,320
Snip, snap. Chip, chap. What are you talking about?

530
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm kidding. I'll get you a fake mustache.

531
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,040
Oh, my God, you've really, really
not thought this through.

532
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,000
Will you please just look at some clothes?

533
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,840
Look at that. I don't wear...

534
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
I have clothes, by the way.

535
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,720
I do not need to do any of this. I'm fine.

536
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,600
Yes. You have the best clothes that Old Navy sells.

537
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,680
I'm just saying you gotta look
like a plastic surgeon's wife.

538
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,160
I want to create the illusion I had a hot first wife.

539
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,640
You're so... Not this!

540
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,360
Okay, come on, let's go, you asked for it.

541
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,480
I'm ready.

542
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,960
Wow! These are... Oh, geez.

543
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,080
Nice, nice.

544
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,200
It's just been a while since I've been in heels, sorry.

545
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,320
Okay, okay. Oh, gosh. Okay.

546
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,200
Get there. Yeah, great.

547
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,720
Oh, my God! These are gorgeous!

548
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,040
How much are these? $1,700.

549
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,800
$1,700? What, do you come with them?

550
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,000
My parents' house costs $1,700. No, no.

551
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,840
No. What, did Mickey Mantle sign those?

552
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,040
Why are they $1,700, they made outta panda?

553
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,520
Walk away. Yeah. You know what?

554
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,400
We won't really be needing them anyway.

555
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,360
'Cause I'm actually starting to...

556
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm actually starting to feel not
so hot. Is it warm in here?

557
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,440
Whoo. I'm not sure I'll be able to make it this evening.

558
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,160
Very good. Okay, you know what? We'll take them.

559
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,440
It's your Christmas bonus. Oh, really?

560
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
Okay, then I would like them in blue, too.

561
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,040
In case a heel breaks or I just want to cuddle.

562
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,080
It's beautiful. You sicken me.

563
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,120
Yes, well, that's why we're getting a divorce.

564
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,360
We're getting a divorce because you're
greedy, schemy and selfish.

565

(STUTTERS)

566
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,760
Actually, I think you need to
get the matching bag, too.

567
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,720
Yeah, I think I should.

568
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,600
Mmm. Thank you, Laurie. I agree.

569
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,600
All the girls are sticking together. Isn't that sweet?

570
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,240
Mmm-hmm. She's on your side, what a shock.

571
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,120
You asked for this. Trust me.

572
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,360
Uh-huh. You asked for this. (EXCLAIMS)

No? No what?

579
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,760
No hope. Okay? There's only one word for it.

580
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,120
What is it? Neglect.

581
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,240
Okay? This is the one word

582
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,680
for the whole thing. Are you the husband?

583
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,120
I'm the soon to be ex-husband.

584
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,440
We're getting a divorce.

585

Well, you know he's not divorcing you.

586
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,120
He's divorcing your head.

587

True 'dat, Ernesto. Right on the money.

588

Your hair is so messed up, I don't even...

589
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,800
Let me count the ways.

590
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,920
It's dull, it's dead, it's flat.

591
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,240
Don't forget smelly.

592
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,680
It don't smell, particularly...

593

Okay, I think we got it. You bad.

594
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,600
You is bad. Give me a little bit. That's bad, though.

595
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,720
You guys, come on, seriously.
Ernesto, can you just, please

596
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,480
do something, so we can be home

597
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
and I can get out of here?

Hurricane Katrina could do something, baby.

599

I'm gonna do something transcendent.

It's weird, she gets me very tense.

I'm sorry to put you through this.

606

No, I understand why we're doing this.

past this part of my life

Oh, gosh. I forgot. You're fifteen.

649
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,840
Erectile dysfunction, my darling.

650
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,240
Think about it as if

651
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,040
you're trying to throw darts and you just...

652
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,080
All you really got, you're shooting with,

653
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,640
like, overcooked spaghetti.

654
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,840
Okay. Yeah.

655
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,520
I just think that my spaghetti wasn't loving

656
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
the meatballs that was being served.

657
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,920
They were a little too lumpy. Oh.

658
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,600
I've heard from a lot of men that I serve

659
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,720
the finest meatballs in Southern California.

660
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,880
Of course. A lot of homeless men have said this.

661
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,440
They'll eat anything, you know.
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

662
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,880
I'm just very shocked that you remember

663
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,560
anybody you've ever been with.

664
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,880
With all the pills that are in your system.

665
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,880
She likes the pills, this one.

666
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,640
At night I come home, "What's for dinner?"

667
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,240
"Well, we have purple pills, and the green ones

668
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
"and some lovely yellow bombers

669
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,680
"I just took out of the oven."

670
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,920
Remember that?

671
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,600
I had to do something to amuse myself

672
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,080
while this one sat on the throne for hours

673
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,240
dealing with his irritable bowel syndrome.

674
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,280
I got another disease. Okay.

675
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,240
Can I tell you, I spent the eve of our wedding

676
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,720
sitting on the bed,

677
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,400
listening to what sounded like
an underwater symphony,

678
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,640
of French horns and bassoons

679
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,440
coming out of our hotel bathroom.

680
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,480
Mix that with the smell of like
a dead cat and some fajitas

681
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,720
and you've got what you call yourself

682
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,720
a severely diminished libido.

683
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,160
(THUDDING) Ow!

684
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,600
Did you just kick me?

685
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,920
No. Did you? You kicked her?

686
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,040
Why'd you kick her?

687
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,600
Yeah, I don't... I... Yes. I... I have leg spasms.

688
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,800
Ow!

689
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,120
It's a side effect.

690
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,000
Terrible side effect from all the pill popping.

691
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
But, you know, it's all better now.

692
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,240
I'm clean and sober and I apologize.

693
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,400
It's okay.

694
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,640
Thirteenth step, right there. Back to drinking.

695
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,040
Oh, Henderson, you thoughtless oaf,

696
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,520
stop texting, open that door.

697
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,960
Why do you keep calling me
Henderson? Just go with it.

698
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,560
Palmer, so lovely to meet you.

699
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,560
Likewise, really.

700
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,440
I mean, look at you two.

701
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,400
I mean, it's like, Barbie and...

702
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,520
Yes.

703
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,400
...Grandpa Ken.

704
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,960
(LAUGHING)

705
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,200
I mean... And even though it did not work out

706
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,960
between us at all...

707
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,440
It's like it never happened. You know?

708
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,680
It really isn't.

709
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,160
I still want my Danny to be happy. Oh, look at that.

710
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,440
Happy, happy, happy.

711
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,680
Good night, kiddo. Okay.

712
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,160
Hello.

713
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,600
It's her drug dealer I'm thinking.

714
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,480
Okay, please put her on the phone right now.

715
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,520
Are you kidding me, honey?

716
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,240
You know how I feel about

717
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,200
you selling your brother's stuff on eBay.

718
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,320
Hey, hey, hey. Take that in the car.

719
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,520
No. It's okay.

720
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,360
I will deal with you when I get
home, young lady. Okay.

721
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,800
I mean, you would think...

722
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,280
You have kids?

723
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,600
Hmm? Hmm?

724
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,640
You have... You have children?

725
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,080
We have sort of a little bit...

726
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,160
A little bit of children, right?

727
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,760
When were you planning on telling me

728
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,960
about these children, Danny?

729
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,320
I don't know, but listen,

730
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,640
I have to go get to those little munchkins.

731
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,720
Palmer, so nice, seriously.

732
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,840
Danny.

733
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,480
No, no, no, hey, hey.

734
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,040
Okay.

735
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,040
Are you freaked out right now about all this or...

736
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,480
Actually, just the opposite.

737
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,480
The opposite of freaked out?
What do you mean? Good?

738
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,880
You know that I love kids.

739
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

740
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,080
I just never pegged you as a kids guy.

741
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,920
I'm a huge kids guy. I love kids.

742
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,680
Kids, kids, kids. Is...

743
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's my thing.
That's my bumper sticker.

744
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,200
What are their names?

745
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,360
What are their names again? There is

746
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,200
the girl who, of course, is Kiki Dee.

747
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,840
And then the boy's name's Bart.

748
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,360
Which of course is short for Barto.

749
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,840
Well, I wanna meet them!

750
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,680
Of course you do.

751
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,080
MAGGIE: So our mom doesn't
know that you took us today?

752
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,400
Not yet.

753
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,080
You know this is kidnapping.

754
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,360
Stranger danger.

755
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,720
What? No.

756
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,440
Is the guy from Dateline NBC gonna walk in?

757
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,920
No! I know you two a long time and Rosa's here.

758
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,200
(SINGING)

759
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,160
Doing whatever that Rosa does.

760
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,480
God, she's freaky. DANNY: Yeah.

761
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
So here's the deal.

762
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,600
How would you like to be my pretend children

763
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,000
for one afternoon?

764
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,080
Why don't you just tell that poor girl the truth?

765
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,240
You know?

766
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,960
Our mother tells us everything.

767
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,400
Wedding ring boy.

768
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,640
What? Oh, my goodness!

769
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,640
Did you see Gossip Girl last night? It was so good!

770
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,600
No, she's not like that.

771
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,920
Your mother's presenting her in a weird, weird way.

772
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,080
I'm just saying, telling the truth

773
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,640
is not in the cards right now.

774
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,160
I thought you'd be excited to have an acting job.

775
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,480
If it's an acting job, we should get paid.

776
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah, you're gonna get paid in experience.

777
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,960
I wanna actually get paid.

778
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,000
(CHUCKLES)

779
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,400
All right, what do you want?

780
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,440
$600 for the day,

781
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,920
plus overtime if we go over eight hours.

782
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,520
I'll do my own hair and makeup.

783
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,640
And I want you to pay for the six-week
intensive acting camp

784
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,040
that my mom can't afford.

785
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,040
$50 for the day and a two-week acting
class at the YMCA nearest you.

786
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,640
$500 and a four- week acting class.

787
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,160
$300 and a three-week class.

788
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,520
Done.

789
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,920
I would have done it for $500.

790
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,040
(SCOFFS) I would have done it for the experience.

791
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,120
Michael, you're up. Opener?

792
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,000
I want you to take me to Hawaii

793
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
so I can swim with the dolphins.

794
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,880
You're not gonna let that one go, are you?

795
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
We're not going to Hawaii, pal. Anything else?

796
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,240
Find someone else then.

797
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,240
Ooh, the Mafia stare down. Very good, Michael.

798
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,680
We're here to negotiate.

799
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,560
Do you have anything else you might like?

800
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,600
I want a flying pony.

801
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,160
I want a flying pony too, Michael, but they don't exist.

802
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,920
Then I want a regular pony. And
I want to name him Nelson.

803
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,040
How about a Playstation 3 and we name him Nelson?

804
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,920
Keep talking.

805
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,040
We'll include four video games.

806
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,200
Five games.

807
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,920
And I want the meeting with blondie
to be at J.D. McFunnigan's.

808
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,200
How 'bout Charlie Choo-Choo's

809
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,440
'cause it's right down the street from me.

810
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,360

(IN ENGLISH ACCENT) Hello, Palmer.

974
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,080
Heard so much about you.

975
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,160
You're British?

976
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,960
So you're the bird what's been given
Daddy the ol' slap and tickle?

977
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,000
We sent her to boarding school last year in England.

978
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,880
See? So she picked up a slight accent.

979
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
It's, you know, very Madonna.

980
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,600
Well, it is a pleasure meeting you, Kiki Dee.

981
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,680
Wish I could say the same.

982
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,240
You see, before you, I had meself a father.

983
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,240
I was the apple of his eye.

984
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,840
It was all giggling and chasing butterflies

985
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,720
in the meadows, and what have you.

986
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,560
And now what do I got?

987
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,520
An hour and a half every other week

988
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,080
at J.D. McFunnigan's with him and his whore.

989
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,320
Koko! Kiki! Kiki!

990
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,040
(CRYING)

991
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,040
God, she's in such pain.

992
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,880
No, that's the pills that...

993
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,160
She took some out of her mother's bureau.

994
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,320
Are you...

995
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,960
All right, let me go see her.

996
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,680
How are you doing, sweetie?

997
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,040
I'll be better when I start seeing some tokens.

998
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,680
He's American.

999
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,080
Excuse me. Yo! What was that all about?

1000
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,200
That was raw and real and in the moment.

1001
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,600
You know, I feel very good about it.

1002
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,320
You do? Well, I don't!

1003
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,120
So if you wanna get your money
and your acting classes,

1004
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,000
you better start doing things right from now on.

1005
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,560
No more sob stories.

1006
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,840
And we're stuck with the English accent now, Ringo,

1007
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,880
so commit to it. Don't choke, got it?

1008
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,040
Got it.

1009
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,120
Now hug me and laugh

1010
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,040
and let's get back into the show.

1011
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,760
Okay. Papa!

1012
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,560
You're not a whore, Palmer.

1013
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,720
Okay.

1014
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,560
That's so nice. See what they do, they fight,

1015
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,880
then they make up and it's good.

1016
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,320
Good. We're doing good.

1017
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,120
(SNEEZES) Are you kidding me?

1018
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,400
Got a hamburger here for Bart, Art the Water Fart.

1019
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,520
Here you go, kid.

1020
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,800
Look at that, sweet!

1021
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,280
And two quesadillas for Kiki Sneaky
With a Side of Freaky.

1022
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,600
Here's the waters. No soda for you.

1023
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,240
You're battling diabetes, remember? Huh?

1024
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,640
Kiki Dee?

1025
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,600
I got you two quesadillas 'cause it's your
favorite food so you have to eat it.

1026
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,320
Well, yes! And that's why I'm going
to eat every single bit of it.

1027
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,240
All right, let's see.

1028
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,120
Yummy!

1029
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,320
(MOUTHING) Thank you.

1030
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,320
Hey, I think we forgot napkins.

1031
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,480
We did? Okay. Well let me get the napkins.

1032
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,160
Because I know she's not gonna get up and do it

1033
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,760
because she doesn't like to get up and do anything.

1034
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,000
Oh, nice.

1035
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,640
Everybody be cool.

1036
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,360
So, Bart, your dad tells me you
like to go to the bathroom.

1037
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,360
When I feel it, I do it.

1038
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,840
What else do you like?

1039
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,440
I don't know.

1040
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,120
That's our Bart.

1041
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,160
He's a man of very few words.

1042
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,240
Ah. Okay.

1043
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,320
Maybe I'm upset.

1044
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,000
Upset about me and your father dating?

1045
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,760
No. You seem to make my dad
happy and that's cool, but...

1046
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,720
But what?

1047
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,120
Nothing.

1048
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,280
Hey, I want you to feel comfortable

1049
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,520
telling me anything.

1050
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,960
Well, I just hate that he broke his promise to me.

1051
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,200
What promise?

1052
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,560
Yeah, what promise?

1053
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,560
He promised me last year that
he would take me to Hawaii

1054
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,680
to swim with the dolphins.

1055
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,200
They have this lagoon there with dolphins

1056
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,680
and people get to swim with them.

1057
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,840
What are you doing?

1058
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,640
But without warning, my dad canceled the trip.

1059
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,360
Why would he do that?

1060
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,480
(FAKES CRYING) He met you.

1061
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,960
He what?

1062
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,960
No! Die!

1063
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,160
No, no, no, no, no, no! I'm saying that did not...

1064
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,560
You misread what I said.

1065
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,520
I said we have to go to Hawaii earlier.

1066
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,840
Because I'm excited for all of us to hang out there.

1067
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,000
We're going to Hawaii!

1068
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,840
I can't believe I let a six-year-old blackmail me.

1069
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,280
I saw my shot and I took it.

1070
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
You're angry at yourself

1071
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,240
'cause you got us into this whole situation.

1072
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,560
I did? You really did.

1073
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,400
I think old Mary Poppins with the,

1074
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,080
"You can't say no. You can't say no, Guv'nor."

1075
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,000
Okay, listen, my tolerance

1076
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,280
for these continued shenanigans is right here.

1077
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,760
And if it gets up to here, I'm taking my kids,

1078
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,680
I'm selling you out and I'm going home.

1079
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,440
I am so happy we are doing this, Danny.

1080
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,120
Are you kidding me? We're going to Hawaii,

1081
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,760
we're gonna swim with dolphins.

1082
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,520
It's gonna be so much fun. I was just telling the squirt.

1083
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,080
And Seventeen magazine.

1084
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,920
You brought that for these guys or is that for you?

1085
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,520
It's mine. It's my favorite.

1086
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,440
See that? Did you ever read that magazine?

1087
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,720
Thirty years ago you did.

1088
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,440
And hopefully we're gonna have
time together, right, sweetie?

1089
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,400
EDDIE: Wait! Wait!

1090
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,200
(EXCLAIMING IN GERMAN)

1091
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,960
Danny, wait!

1092
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,120
Muffinstein, I could not stand to be without you.

1093
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,400
(MUFFLED GROAN) Uh-oh!

1094
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,520
Is this him?

1095
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,160
I see the Colonel von Generous
right here in front of me.

1096
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,840
Okay, I'm confused right now.

1097
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,120
I'm so sorry. I've not introduced myself,

1098
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,640
we have talked on the phone,
but I am the Dolph Lundgren.

1099
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,160
Devlin's man-friendl love monkey.

1100
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,400
Oh, kill me now.

1101
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,400
Devlin said you had to stay back and work.

1102
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,000
I did. She what said?

1103
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,520
Nein, nein to the work.

1104
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,320
I will work when I am kaput.

1105
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,000
You know, I think this is so great

1106
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,600
of all of you, so mature.

1107
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,680
I would have loved if my parents
had done something like this

1108
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,160
when they got divorced.

1109
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,480
That's why I was thinking we
should have the man come.

1110
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,200
Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad.

1111
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,200
It's important for the children

1112
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,360
to see us as a unit.

1113
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,400
And also I cannot stay away from this potato pancake.

1114
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,160
She loves the schnitzel, you know what I mean?

1115
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,800
(GROANS)

1116
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,760
You know what? Tongue feels a little dry.

1117
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,200
Let's go get you some water, honey. We'll be back.

1118
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,800
That's a big tongue, big tongue.

1119
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,240
Get over here, get over here. Ew!

1120
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,360
What are you doing here?

1121
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,600
I don't know, saving the day. Helping. Hello?

1122
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,520
Who are you talking to? What are you looking at?

1123
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,440
I can't see in these things.

1124
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,600
This is what you're gonna do.

1125
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,440
You're gonna tell them that you ate a
bad sauerkraut omelet for breakfast

1126
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,840
and that you are feeling like you're
sick and that you gotta go.

1127
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,600
Katherine, I can't go. Okay? Why?

1128
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,320
Because I texted a picture of my new
equipment to my ex-girlfriend.

1129
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,440
Oh, you're disgusting.

1130
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,320
And I forgot she's engaged to a UFC fighter.

00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,240
Both of us here at this resort at the same time.

1290
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,080
I didn't know you came to places like this.

1291
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,200
Here we go.

1292
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,280
Honey!

1293
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,080
Honey, I want you to meet someone.

1294
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,240
This is one of my best friends from my sorority.

1295
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,080
Katherine, this is my husband, lan Maxtone Jones.

1296
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,240
Pleasure.

1297
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,160
You might've heard of him. He invented the iPod.

1298
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,440
Well, of course he did. The iPod.

1299
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,800
The idea just came to me in the shower.

1300
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,480
A shower that I was taking with Devlin.

(GIGGLING)

1302
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,280
So, this is a cabana you guys
got yourselves here, huh?

1303
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,840
Because my skin is so white.
I don't like to get it burned.

1304
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,680
Even at night?

1305
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,400
Well, in Hawaii, you never know with the sun.

1306
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,600
Very, very strong.

1307
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,560
So you mean like a moonburn or...

You look great.

1311
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,840
I'm so glad you got your teeth fixed. Much better.

1312
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,600
You are just the same glorious Devlin that I remember.

1313
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,520
Oh, my God, I ran into Sandra Wernick last month.

1314
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,480
The poor thing. She's already
divorced and she has a child.

1315
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,360
She's a single mother. It's a disaster.

1316
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,040
I feel so bad for her.

1317
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,840
Are you married?

1318
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,760
Mmm-hmm. Yes.

1319
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,760
Oh! I've neglected to introduce you to Danny,

1320
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,600
Daniel Leroy Maccabee Ill, my husband.

1321
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,840
Yes. If you want me to stay,

1322
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,040
will you just go with it, honey?

1323
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,600
Come here and please meet Devlin and lan.

1324
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,280
Hey. This is Daniel.

1325

IPod, what's up? How are you?

1326
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,880
I'm fine.

1327
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,040
Invented it. Pleasure. I heard.

1328
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,000
Devlin, I think I spoke about you with my wife

1329
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,840
in the bathroom one or two times, right?

1330
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,040
We did.

1331
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,480
Number two.

1332
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,200
We did it twice, yes.

1333
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,960
So, chief, tell me, what do you do for a living?

1334
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,080
I'm also an inventor, just like you.

1335
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,800
I invented the barking hand.

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,920
No. What?

1339
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,760
You are a surgeon.

1340

Yes. Well, that, yeah.

Touched it down.

1345

We gotta go back. We have to
run. It was great to see you.

1346
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,200
We have to get back to our kids. So...

1347
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,600
You have kids?

1348
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,000
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, two, actually.

1349
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:45,280
We couldn't wait to start creating lives.

1350
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,520
And by the way, I created these children

1351
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,240
in the shower. Right?

1352
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,880
You did. You know what I'm saying, homeboy?

leave me hanging so long?

You're so clever. That's so silly.

1362

The four of us should get together

1363
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,640
and have dinner one night.

You need me, though, right?

00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,480
That was a ten! A perfect ten! Yay!

1448
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,640
So, Al Jolson, you mind jumping in the water

1449
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,000
and also screaming on the way
down, "I love my daddy"?

1450
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,560
Okay.

1451
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,360
Yeah, do it, do it for me.

1452
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,000
Do it for Da-da. KATHERINE: I love my daddy.

1453
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,160
Daddy is my favorite adult!

1454
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,360
(WHOOPS) You're paying her enough for this, right?

1455
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,400
And I love you, my little British crumpet!

1456
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,200
All right, homeboy, you're up next. Let's go.

1457
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,960
Come up with something on your own.

1458
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,400
You gotta squeeze out another log?

1459
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,240
What happened? What'd he whisper to you?

1460
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,200
Water's too deep.

1461
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,760
Water's too deep for what?

1462
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,040
He can't swim.

1463
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,120
He can't swim?

1464
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,960
And you wanna swim with the dolphins?

1465
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,880
That makes a lot of sense.

1466
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,160
Hadn't thought it through.

1467
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,000
No kidding you didn't think it through.

1468
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,920
Thought about spending all my
money, though, didn't you?

1469
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,440
Danny! I'm saying, I'm not the kid's...

1470
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,880
Okay. No one taught you how to swim, huh?

1471
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,600
Well, my dad's supposed to, but he's busy.

1472
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,840
Uh-huh. Busy being an idiot.

1473
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,600
You guys have to come in, the water feels magical!

1474
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,360
I got something magical, too.
Right in the downstairs area.

1475
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,120
I don't high-five when it's...

1476
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,400
Downstairs area!

1477
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,200
No, put it away. Sorry. No, stop.

1478
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,200
You know what? I think Mommy's gonna
explore the magical waters.

1479
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,280
Honey, are you okay to hang
out here with fake Daddy?

1480
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:09,960
Sure.

1481
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,600
Really? You're gonna get undressed?

1482
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,680
What are you doing?

1483
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,440
What? You got a bathing cap, too?

1484
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,720
You're the worst.

1485
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,760
A 1920s swimming gown on, honey?

1486
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,040
Don't do it. Don't take it off.

1487
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,120
Yeah. I have to be alone.

1488
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,440
Okay.

1489
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,280
God, I gotta start taking the stairs more.

1490
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,480
Don't buy that line.

1491
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,920
She takes spinning classes like they're M&M's.

1492
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,520
I think he's wearing my underwear.

1493
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,080
What is he doing?

1494
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,440
Yo, I guarantee you fall!

1495
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,960
I'm all set.

1496
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,280
(EXCLAIMING)

1497
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,760
Ow!

1498
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,520
Thank you, God.

1499
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,640
I wanna climb Palmer Mountain,

1500
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,440
so what do you say we get rid of these kids?

1501
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,160
No. They had them last night. It's our turn.

1502
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,680
Isn't that how things work? We alternate?

1503
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,200
What? No.

1504
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,160
I get the kids... I had them today.

1505
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,560
That counted as a "me" day

1506
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,760
and then she gets them at night.

1507
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,040
That's how we do it. Oh.

1508
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,800
Dolph, Devlin, do you want us to watch the kids

1509
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,960
so that you guys can have a little alone time?

1510
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:37,200
I don't think... Yes! Absoshnutely!

1511
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,560
We are sleeping together!

1512
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,480
You guys have your own beds and it's our time!

1513
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,200
So we're gonna watch them. Good.

1514
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,640
You guys wanna come take a look at the balcony?

1515
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,840
I think I saw some dolphins around here.

1516
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,200
Dolphins? Hey, he loves those, right? Dolphins.

1517
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,400
Sorry. Okay, go.

1518
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,840
All right, let go. Come on.

1519
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,320
Get the dolphins. Bye, you guys.

1520
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,080
That's why we're here, the dolphins.

1521
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,240
See you out there.

1522
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,840
Listen, if anything happens

1523
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,480
and you need any... And I mean anything,

1524
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,720
you have to call me.

1525
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,320
I'm good at this, I swear to you.

1526
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,520
I used to baby-sit Eddie when we were children.

1527
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,960
Eddie is your fault? No, no, no.

1528
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,840
But I want you to enjoy tonight.

1529
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,000
Come on, it's like a free night.

1530
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,520
You can do whatever you want.

1531
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,440
You can knit yourself some socks

1532
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,440
or shock people with your sneaky hot body.

1533
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,240
I don't know what you're talking about. Cary Grant?

1534
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,720
I'm just gonna sit in my room

1535
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,360
and worry about you and them and everything.

1536
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,280
What about just hang out platonically

1537
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,000
with Eddie tonight? Have some dinner?

1538
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,440
Or is he not good enough?

1539
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,520
You need Brian, the guy from Foghat, around here.

1540
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,920
That really bothered you

1541
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,880
that I went to lunch with that guy.

1542
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,520
What do you mean, you went to lunch with him?

1543
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,560
I told you I was going to lunch with him.

1544
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,440
I thought it was he asked you to lunch

1545
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,760
and you were gonna like scoff at it.

1546
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,200
But you did? You fell for his charms?

1547
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,040
I don't even understand what this is.

1548
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,440
It's the beard, man.

1549
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,840
It doesn't move!

1550
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,720
Well, yeah, in the wind, man. It's flapping around.

1551
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,360
All right. You know what? I'll tell you this.

1552
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,960
The guy made it through an entire lunch with a woman

1553
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:58,680
without making up a fake life.

1554
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,320
Ah.

1555
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,080
You just hurt me.

1556
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,240
That was not nice, but it was the truth.

1557
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,400
And I speak the truth.

1558
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,120
Please pay attention to my children.

1559
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,360
Everything will be nice.

1560
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,240
They serve room service in the hallway.

1561
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,760
I'm so nauseous. Okay. Bye.

1562
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,040
Alone at last!

1563
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,440
(WHIMPERING)

1564
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,880
(COUGHS)

1565
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,520
Let's play the game.

1566
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,640
We were doing so good with the game.

1567
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,320
"If you could be one person besides yourself,

1568
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,720
"who would you be?"

1569
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,520
Rachael Ray, because I've always

1570
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,600
wanted to know how to cook.

1571
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,440
Really? Oh, she's darling.

1572
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,200
You know what? I don't really wanna be anyone else.

1573
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:46,960
I'm happy with who I am. I choose me.

1574
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,320
Or Captain Kirk. Either one.

1575
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,200
See, that's a good one. All right.

1576
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,520
What about you, Bart?

1577
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,600
Mr. DeCesare.

1578
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,000
Our mailman? Why?

1579
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,040
He just seems like he's got it all figured out.

1580
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,840
We're getting deep.

1581
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,160
Okay, moving on. Uh...

1582
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,960
Okay. "Name something that makes you sad."

1583
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,800
That Judi Dench has never won
the Oscar for Best Actress.

1584
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,600
(CRYING) It's a travesty.

1585
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,960
That 'N Sync broke up.

1586
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,360
Yeah. That was rough on all of us.

1587
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,640
(SOFTLY) Who's 'N Sync?

1588
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:31,840
Sadness. Bart, you're up.

1589
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,040
I don't wanna say mine.

1590
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,960
Okay. Let's move on then.

1591
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,200
Hey!

1592
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,480
Honey, come on. You can share anything with us.

1593
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,680
Yeah, share.

1594
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,480
He looks like he's about to lose it, but okay.

1595
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,840
When my dad doesn't have time for me.

1596
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,160
Come on, it's okay.

1597
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:53,400
We're okay. We're okay. It's fine.

1598
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,160
It's all gonna be okay. Come on.

1599
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,360
We don't need him in our lives.

1600
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,840
Wow.

1601
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,240
No, no, no, he's...

1602
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,560
MAGGIE: We're okay. It's fine.

1603
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,160
It's all gonna be okay.

1604
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,200
This has nothing to...

1605
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,600
This is, like, from a long time ago!

1606
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,680
It's okay.

1607
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,520
What are you doing?

1608
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,280
DANNY: Well, that was a major setback.

1609
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,360
"When my dad doesn't have time
for me." (IMITATES CRYING)

1610
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,320
We're sorry.

1611
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,560
I know you're sorry.

1612
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,400
I know you got real stuff going on with your family.

1613
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,760
And it's painful.

1614
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,720
But you gotta just hold it in

1615
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,400
till you get to the mainland again.

1616
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,720
You're the ones who wanted to come here

1617
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,960
and go swimming with the dolphins

1618
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,200
or standing with the dolphins because you can't swim.

1619
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,400
Can you act professional? BOTH: Yes, sir.

1620
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,600
For at least two more days, until I kill you off

1621
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,760
in a boarding school train accident?

1622
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,600
I thought it was a car accident.

1623
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:44,760
I don't know. Either that

1624
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,200
or a science explosion, just something.

1625
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,520
You're gonna be dead soon. That's
the good news. Okay?

1626
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,800
So, can you just focus for a few more days?

1627
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,240
BOTH: Yes. Good.

1628
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,920
So, give me some fake hugs right
now and laugh real loud

1629
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,280
like we're the happiest family on earth.

1630
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:57,920
Okay. Is that possible?

1631
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,480
And laughing, laughing, laughing.

1632
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:03,080
Okay, that's it. Laugh louder, louder.

1633
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,520
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

1634
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,040
DANNY: I love you guys!

1635
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,600
Hey, sweetie! What's going on? What's up?

1636
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,800
So, kids, I just got off the phone with your mom

1637
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,480
and you guys are gonna have plenty of time

1638
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,000
to spend with your dad tomorrow

1639
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,240
because she and I are gonna
have a nice, long spa day.

1640
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,400
ALL: Aw!

1641
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,480
Awesome! Awesome, awesome.

1642
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,520
You guys are so...

1643
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,560
I'll see you in a minute, okay? I love you.

1644
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,880
(KIDS EXCLAIMING)

1645
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,760
Okay, he's losing it. Okay, good night.

1646
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:35,920
He's losing it.

1647
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
DANNY: All right, here we go. Everybody out.

1648
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,480
So, what are we doing?

1649
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,000
Palmer forgot her camera in the room

1650
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,560
so I'm gonna have a surprise for her

1651
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:48,040
when she gets back from the spa.

1652
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,480
MAGGIE: A stolen camera?

1653
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,120
No, some pictures of us having a great time

1654
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,840
reassuring her of all the fun we have together.

1655
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,880
I forgot to flush the toilet before I left the hotel.

1656
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,720
So she's gonna have two surprises.

1657
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,000
Okay. No one's supposed to crap as much as you do.

1658
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,360
You gotta look into that Pepto Bismol or something.

1659
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,640
Here's your putters. Bing.

1660
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,560
And a bam. Thank you.

1661
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,640
Let's just look right in the camera.
And we're having fun.

1662
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,640
And we're a family. We love each other.

1663
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,520
And boo! (SHUTTER CLICKS)

1664
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,320
All right, let's do the old Michael-hit-a-putt shot. Okay?

1665
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,360
So boom, that's in the hole.

1666
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,640
And you're excited about that,

1667
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,760
and we're happy for him, and...
(EXCLAIMS) (SHUTTER CLICKS)

1668
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,200
Maggie just hit the ball, but you
followed through too much

1669
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,720
and it made you fall on your back.

1670
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,160
Okay, but... Look at this.

1671
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,480
You're laughing, but I'm a concerned
father, so I'm like,

1672
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,440
"Oh, my God." (SHUTTER CLICKS)

1673
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,360
All right, now,

1674
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,520
let's just laugh at something I
say, because I'm a funny dad.

1675
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,560
You're very close with me, and
you think I'm funny, and...

1676
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,960
Why are we always laughing?

1677
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,360
Is there something wrong with us?

1678
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,360
No. You're just amused by everything
I say. So, here we go.

1679
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,920
Can we take a break? Do something really fun?

1680
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,720
No, we're not doing anything fun, man.

1681
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,400
We're here to fake having fun.

1682
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,640
Come on. Right to the camera.

1683
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,600
Don't worry. We never have
fun with our real dad either.

1684
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,200
Oh, man.

1685
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,920
(SIGHS) All right. How's this?

1686
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,520
I'll teach you how to swim, okay?

1687
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,360
Before your mother gets back

1688
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,920
from the "spa day" in four hours?

1689
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,760
Is that even possible? Yeah.

1690
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,680
But we're gonna take one more
picture, if you don't mind.

1691
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,040
Make that two pictures. Maggie.

1692
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,840
Throw this straight in the air. Make it look like...

On the count of three, one, two,
three. (SHUTTER CLICKS)

1694
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,760
Okay.

1695
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,400
Now, Michael, lay down.

1696
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,360
On your back. And...

1697
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,880
Yeah, all the way over. See if you can clench this.

1698
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,800
Now look like you're in pain.

DANNY: Ooh! (SHUTTER CLICKS)

1700
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,640
It took my friend a whole summer
to learn how to swim.

1701
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,360
How're you gonna teach me so quick?

1702
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,960
I'm gonna do it the same way
my grandfather taught me.

Don't worry.

1705
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,520
It took Grandpa eight hours to teach us.

1706
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,600
It was a nightmare.

1707
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,560
But there's two of us here now, and we're sober.

1708
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,000
You're gonna be fine.

1709
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,280
All right. You're doing great.

Is he doing great? He's doing great.

1711
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,800
Okay. We want to advance a little, though.

1712
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,800
I need you to swim to Uncle Eddie.

1713
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,400
If you get there without touching the bottom,

1714
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,800
we'll give you a dolphin cookie.

Is that what your grandpa gave you?

1717
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,920
No, Grandpa gave us something he'd call a Heineken.

1718
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,000
I want one of those.

1719
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,320
No. Stick with the dolphin cookie.

1720
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,160
Yeah. They hurt less when they
get thrown at your head.

1721
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,760
God, he was a sick man.

1722
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,160
Yeah. Okay? Are we ready?

1723
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,600
Don't think about it. Commit. Kick, kick.

1724
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,440
Get the cookie. Move your feet.

1725
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,640
Kick, kick!

1726
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,640
Right there! Reach for it! You got it!

1727
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,840
Doing good, buddy!

1728
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:34,960
There you go!

My boy! That was terrific, buddy.

1730
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,680
Have your cookie. We're gonna move on, though.

Devlin? Yeah?

1733
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,560
So, Danny's birthday is next week,

1734
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,240
and I have no idea what to get him.

1735
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,760
(GROANS)

1736
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,840
Well, don't get him a tie.

1737
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,080
He has 100 of them and he never wears them.

1738
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,240
That's good to know.

1739
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,640
He loves books on tape for his car.

1740
01:09:58,720 --> 01:09:59,920
Fishing gear.

1741
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,640
Loves it. Doesn't use it.

1742
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,200
Can't take the fish off of the hook

1743
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,200
once he catches it, so he just collects it.

1744
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,240
He loves candy. Jelly Bellies. Loves them, his favorite.

1745
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,320
But he only likes the Cotton Candy
and the Peanut Butter.

1746
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,520
So you have to buy the bag of the Jelly Bellies,

1747
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,160
separate the Cotton Candy and the Peanut Butter

1748
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,320
and put them into a little...

1749
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,320
It's a kind of Ziploc baggies that I got online.

1750
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,360
You know so much about him.

1751
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,520
Yeah.

1752
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,440
I've known the guy forever.

1753
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,400
Music. Loves music.

1754
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,760
But anything after '95, don't bother.

1755
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,040
You'll lose him.

1756
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,440
That's when I finished my Girl Scouts.

1757
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,280
All right. How many cookies do we got left?

1758
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,280
Maybe about forty!

1759
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,080
What do you think, 40 feet for 40 cookies?

1760
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,880
Can you handle that? You need a little rest?

1761
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,040
Let's do this.

1762
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,120
Really? Okay, he's ready! He's ready to rock!

1763
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,520
Almost.

1764
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:53,920
What? No.

1765
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,920
Oh, my! Ladies and gentlemen, off come the floaties!

1766
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,920
This is getting serious!

1767
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,160
Are you sure about this, Michael?

1768
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,960
Hell, yeah. All right.

1769
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,120
No matter what, you're a good man, okay?

1770
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,480
Keep kicking. I'm here if you need me.

1771
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,600
You got this.

1772
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,240
Go! Go, Michael!

1773
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,880
DANNY: Go! Breathe! Yeah!

1774
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,560
Kick it! Go!

1775
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,080
Move your arms! Yeah!

1776
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,680
(ALL CHEERING)

1777
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:18,400
He doesn't have floaties on!

1778
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,080
Oh, my God!

1779
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,480
DANNY: Get the cookies!

1780
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,400
KATHERINE: Come on, sweetheart! You've got it!

1781
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:24,520
A little bit more, little bit more.

1782
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,240
Swim! Swim! KATHERINE: Oh, my God!

1783
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,680
EDDIE: Come on! Just a little bit more!

1784
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,600
Keep going, Michael! Don't give up!

1785
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,720
(ALL CHEERING)

1786
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,320
EDDIE: Very nice!

1787
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,240
That's my boy! Yeah, buddy!

1788
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,920
I did it! I did it! Thank you!

1789
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,640
No way, that was you, buddy.

1790
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,200
That was awesome. Way to go!

1791
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:01,800
What are we looking at?

1792
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,640
Jeez. Oh, God. Devlin. (GROANS)

1793
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,640
Devlin. Oh, God. You snuck up on me.

1794
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,400
Did I? Oh... Yes.

1795
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,080
Do you startle easily? That's a sign of menopause.

1796
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,160
Hmm...

1797
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:15,800
Devlin?

1798
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,040
Palmer Dodge, this is Devlin.

1799
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,200
She and I went to college together.

1800
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,280
This is Palmer Dodge. DEVLIN: Aloha, Palmer.

1801
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,200
Is this your daughter?

1802
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,040
No, no, no. I'm actually the girlfriend.

1803
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,200
Whose girlfriend?

1804
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,720
Yes, hi. (GREETS IN GERMAN)

1805
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,080
I am the Dolph. Willkommen.
And you're very beautiful.

1806
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,320
Married, flattered. Thanks. Where's Danny?

1807
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,080
Danny is in the water teaching
our little boy how to swim.

1808
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,320
(EXCLAIMING) Hi, Doctor!

1809
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,400
He was so sweet.

1810
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,720
You know what's so crazy is that
I have never met anybody

1811
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,200
with the first name Devlin before.

1812
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,920
You know, and here you are, and
your name's Devlin and...

1813
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,400
Shark attack!

1814
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,480
We are playing Bavarian pool rugby
and now I'm in the lead.

1815
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:58,880
Okay, bye!

1816
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,240
She's trying to beat me, but she won't.

1817
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,320
No one can! (LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

1818
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,480
This is fun!

1819
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:08,920
Anyway, something's opened
up in our schedule tonight.

1820
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,600
So, we were wondering if you and Danny

1821
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,920
were good to go for dinner.

1822
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,280
Oceano's. Seven o'clock. Oh, no...

1823
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,560
Oh, no, you don't! She's like a shark. Come on.

1824
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,840
Is it a bad night? Are you two fighting?

1825
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,560
No! We're not fighting.

1826
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,760
No, we just, we're delighting. We're just fine.

1827
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,560
No, that's great. Tonight's gonna
happen. Yeah, perfect.

1828
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,440
Perfect. Anyway, see you tonight!

1829
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:29,760
Okay, Devlin.

1830
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,920
Oh, my God! Dolph, let her breathe!

1831
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,040
Yes, I... (SHRIEKS)

1832
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:35,600
Dolph! What?

1833
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,760
What was that?

1834
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,680
(FAKING SHOCK)

1835
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,120
I was... Were you under...

1836
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,720
I don't understand. Why would you say yes?

1837
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,600
Because I didn't know, I didn't say no.

1838
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,360
I'm not leaving here. What would I tell Palmer?

1839
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,240
(GROANING)

1840
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,160
What's going on, sweetie?

1841
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,240
So, today, you know, with Dolph
pushing me in the pool.

1842
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,640
It was weird, right?

1843
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,880
No, no, no. He's a sheepherder.

1844
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,280
That's what those guys do, you know?

1845
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,240
They do a lot of horseplay

1846
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,240
and that's kind of initiation time for you.

1847
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,920
You're in the gang, I think.

1848
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,520
Okay. Yeah.

1849
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,360
Well, I was thinking for tonight,

1850
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,720
maybe we could have a little me and you time?

1851
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,080
Oh!

1852
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,680
I'll get my rubber duck and see you in a sec.

1853
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,320
Yeah, no, I'm not doing this tonight.

1854
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,520
It's like my first night alone with the girl.

1855
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,360
All I'm asking you is one favor!

1856
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,120
Just get this one dinner with me so I can save face

1857
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,760
with this horrible, heinous human being.

1858
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,040
What am I gonna tell Palmer?

1859
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,360
Would you just put her on the phone?

1860
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,040

Oh, God.

1863
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,520
Tell me she is not listening to 'N Sync.

1864
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,400
No, no, no. It's coming from the elevator.

1865
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,800
Hey!

1866
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,480
Danny, that is my jam.

1867
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,800
Someone on the phone for you.

1868
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,520
I don't know who. PALMER: Okay.

1869
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,560
Hello?

1870
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,160
What is that?

1871
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,560
It's Palmer. So?

1872
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,400
I need you to get on the phone.
I need you to ask her out.

1873
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,240
I need you to take her as far away
from the hotel for the entire night.

1874
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,440
Would you please just do this for me?

1875
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,160
No, I'm already eating. I just wanna hang out. Ow!

1876
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,960
Seriously, I need you. What are you doing? No.

1877
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,640
Ow! My gosh.

1878
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,480
Take it. All right.

1879
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,680
Go for Dolph.

1880
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,320
It's Dolph.

1881
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,680
Okay, I got an idea.

1882
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,680
How about you and me,

1883
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:31,480
we go and get the dinner tonight?

1884
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,640
To supper?

1885
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,000
Tonight?

1886
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,280
Yes, and we get to know each other,

1887
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,240
because I think it's important for the kids

1888
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,880
to have good symmetry in the family unit.

1889
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,080
Yeah, hang on. Let me check with Danny.

1890
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,400
Dolph wants to do dinner tonight.

1891
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,240
No. No, no, no.

1892
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,720
All right, tell him yeah.

1893
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah, that's fine.

1894
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,040
Awesome. Thank you so much.

1895
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:56,880
What am I supposed to say to her all night?

1896
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:01,680
You spout crazy nonsense for hours in Eurotrashenese.

1897
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:05,120
Just do it, but just do it far away from the hotel.

1898
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,560
Okay, fine, I'll do it,

1899
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,120
but if I do good, can I sleep in the bed with you?

1900
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,040
No. Why? You've got a great private room.

(HAWAIIAN MUSIC PLAYING)

1903
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,800
Hmm, really? Because when
we were in the Napa Valley,

1904
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,360
they said that wasn't a good time of year for Merlot.

1905
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,720
Oh. How about the Verite Cabernet?

1906
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,840
Isn't Cabernet really grapey?

1907
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:38,080
I mean, I like grapey, but not overly grapey.

1908
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,120
Did you go over the index cards?

1909
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,240
I glanced at them, yes.

1910
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,440
You glanced at them?

1911
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,000
I graduated med school

1912
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,560
without reading a book. Just relax.

1913
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,800
Just give us the most expensive bottle you have

1914
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,560
and it'll probably be good enough.

1915
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,880
Perfect!

1916
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:57,320
Look at us, Katherine. Both so
happily married. I mean...

1917
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,120
Can you believe it?

Do you understand what joy that brought me?

How about the look on her face

when you were doing the juggling, though?

2248

The juggling was the highlight for me.

2249
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:40,800
That was pretty good. You liked that?

It was so cute.

Michael, the crap is the stinking...

2405
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,240
(RINGING)

2406
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,480
Hello?

2407
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,320
DANNY: Hey, you up?

2408
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,560
Hi. Yeah. Glad you called.

2409
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:48,920
Are you?

2410
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:50,920
Um...

2411
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,840
Yeah, I was, uh, just checking flights

2412
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,440
for your parents tomorrow and I found...

2413
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,000
No, no, no. You don't have to do that.

2414
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:02,240
Her parents aren't coming in

2415
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,760
and she wants it to be kind of elope-y.

2416
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,760
Elope-y.

2417
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,600
Got it.

2418
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:10,640
Okay, uh, so, are you all set

2419
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,720
for what you need to wear tomorrow?

2420
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:16,000
Do you think this is a good idea?

2421
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,680
What? The wedding?

2422
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:23,120
Yeah, the wedding... Just the whole Palmer thing.

2423
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:29,120
Well, that's why we came out here, right?

2424
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,280
I guess.

2425
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:33,960
You don't think it's crazy?

2426
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:36,120
(SIGHS)

2427
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:42,400
Um, Danny, you don't need my permission.

2428
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,760
Okay? You're a big boy.

2429
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,480
I know, I just...

2430
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:54,040
I know if I do this that...

2431
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Just, things could get weird

2432
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,400
between you and me at the office, so...

2433
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:04,000
Well, you're not gonna have to worry about that.

2434
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,160
You going to New York?

2435
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:11,360
Yeah. I just, you know, I mean...

2436
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,840
As much as I was looking forward to you, um,

2437
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:18,080
reconstructing my face,

2438
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:22,520
I really just need to start fresh, you know?

2439
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,160
Hello, are you there?

2440
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:29,640
You understand?

2441
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,320
I guess.

2442
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,680
It's an awful lot of guessing
coming through this phone.

2443
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:40,040
I've been divorced, I have two kids,

2444
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:42,040
I don't have time for guessing.

2445
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,440
Got a big day tomorrow, Doc, all right?

2446
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:51,440
So why don't you just get yourself some sleep?

2447
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:08,040
So that's it. You have nothing else to worry about.

2448
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:10,240
We have the flowers, the music and the location,

2449
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,640
which is ha-wowie, by the way, you're gonna love it.

2450
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,920
I promise you it is going to be

2451
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,960
the most wonderful day of your life, guaranteed.

2452
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:19,960
Devlin. Yeah.

2453
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:21,320
Oh! Palmer! I didn't...

2454
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:29,320
Well, you just look absolutely beautiful.

2455
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,800
Really? Thank you. Yes.

2456
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,080
Devlin, can I ask you something?

2457
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:35,240
'Course.

2458
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,480
Do you still want to be with Danny?

2459
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:41,160
Wait. What?

2460
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:42,800
Because I think that

2461
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,840
he still may be in love with you.

2462
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:50,560
Really?

2463
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:54,760
Why would you think that?

2464
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:58,240
He's always glowing when you're around.

2465
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,680
And he laughs at your jokes. He doesn't laugh at mine.

2466
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:06,240
Palmer, trust me, there is nothing
between me and Danny.

2467
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:08,280
We're just, you know,

2468
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,080
we're familiar.

2469
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,280
And you are the girl for him.

2470
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,760
He even told me that last night.

2471
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:19,440
My God, Devlin, this is such a relief

2472
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:23,440
because I could never stand a
chance going up against you.

2473
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,480
Turn around. Tell me if this fits.

2474
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:27,680
Put the hanger up your nose.

2475
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:28,880
(LAUGHS) Stop!

2476
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,160
Excuse me.

2477
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,720
Here you go. Thank you.

2478
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,160
Katherine!

2479
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,840
Katherine! Oh, Devlin.

2480
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,640
That was so much fun last night.

2481
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:48,800
I know.

2482
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:52,160
I am still trying to work out how you cheated.

2483
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:55,240
I didn't. That's what happened.

2484
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,680
So, where's Danny?

2485
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:01,000
Devlin...

2486
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:04,800
Danny's at his wedding.

2487
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:06,480
Come again?

2488
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:08,160
I was never married to him.

2489
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,360
All a big lie that I made up.

2490
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,760
Why?

2491
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:18,000
'Cause I couldn't stand the thought
of you knowing the truth.

2492
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:19,160
Really?

2493
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:22,320
So, yeah, I'm a single mother.

2494
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,400
I have two kids that I love

2495
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,880
more than anything in the world.

2496
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:29,920
I drive a Honda. Still have dial-up internet.

2497
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:34,200
I got a 2.7 GPA in college, not a 3.4.

2498
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,200
And while I'm at it telling the truth,

2499
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:38,400
I named my kids' poop after you.

2500
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,000
And I work for Danny. I'm his assistant.

2501
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,200
That's it.

2502
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:48,000
Really, I would never have guessed this.

2503
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:49,840
I mean, you two had a real connection.

2504
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,520
He's great. He's the greatest guy.

2505
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:59,120
And I might even be in love with him,

2506
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,120
but that doesn't really matter at this moment

2507
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:06,600
because he is getting married
to another person right now.

2508
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:10,720
lan and I are breaking up.

2509
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:14,760
What? What happened?

2510
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,240
Well, for starters, he's gay.

2511
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:19,520
He's gay?

2512
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,160
I mean, look at him.

2513
01:45:21,320 --> 01:45:23,320
That's a strong muscle right there.

2514
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,880
I'm squeezing.

2515
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,840
Devlin, I gotta tell you,

2516
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,800
last night, with the ass grab of the coconut,

2517
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:31,880
little bit of a red flag.

2518
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,480
(LAUGHS)

2519
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:35,600
I've seen him do that with the soap.

2520
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:36,960

(SINGING HAWAIIAN TUNE)

2522
01:45:42,360 --> 01:45:43,920
What about the iPod?

2523
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,760
Oh, he didn't invent shit.

2524
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:47,080
He didn't?

2525
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,800
No! He made his money suing the Dodgers

2526
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:52,000
after he got hit by a foul ball.

2527
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:56,800
Oh, God! That's so... What?

2528
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,440
Well, this is different.

2529
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:04,520
Yeah, why didn't we try this truth-telling thing before?

2530
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:06,360
I don't know.

2531
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,080
Hey. Hey.

2532
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,360
What?

2533
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:12,680
That's nice.

2534
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,960
It's nice to tell the truth. That's good.

2535
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,560
The truth is fun, isn't it?

2536
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:18,120
Like, were you telling the truth

2537
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,880
when you said you might be in love with me?

2538
01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,440
I'm gonna leave you two. Okay.

2539
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,480
I'm gonna go get a divorce. Good luck.

Wait, where are my kids?

2542
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:35,280
Palmer took them out for ice cream.

2543
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,400
So, how was the wedding?

2544
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:39,840
Okay. All right.

2545
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:43,880
So, we're standing on top of this beautiful cliff. Uh-huh.

2546
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,240
I start looking out into the Pacific,

2547
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,880
and I think to myself,

2548
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,760
"Wow. I am about to start my life

2549
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,880
"with the one I love."

2550
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,640
And the only problem was,

2551
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:02,160
the one I love was not with me.

2552
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:04,560
She wasn't?

2553
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:05,840
She was not.

2554
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,640
So you didn't?

2555
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,040
I couldn't.

2556
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:11,320
You couldn't.

2557
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:16,320
I mean, don't we have something extra

2558
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:17,720
happening with us?

2559
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:21,040
Danny, I...

2560
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:26,720
What happens when we're not on fake-cation

2561
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:29,960
and you wake up and realize this is real?

2562
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:33,040
You are the only real thing I've ever had in my life.

2563
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,400
Danny, come on, man. I don't...

2564
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:38,600
She's beautiful and she's... I'm not twenty-three.

2565
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,360
I'm not that.

2566
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:44,480
She's good, she's very nice,

2567
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:47,240
there's only one problem. She's not you.

2568
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:48,560
She's not you.

2569
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,240
I have two kids.

2570
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,920
I can't just drive them off a cliff. You know?

2571
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:56,680
(IN ENGLISH ACCENT) I love those kids

2572
01:47:56,760 --> 01:47:58,800
more than anything in the world, Guv'nor.

2573
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,480
(LAUGHS)

2574
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,800
No, I wanna be with those guys like 23 hours a day.

2575
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,040
What about the other hour?

2576
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:17,360
(PEOPLE CHEERING)

2577
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:18,760
SAILOR: Good job!

2578
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,480
That's what I'm talking about.

2579
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:21,920
Whatever!

2580
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,520
(SQUEAKING)

2581
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,880
DANNY: Well, everything turned out

2582
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:30,120
pretty good for everybody.

2583
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:33,160
Squirt got to swim with the dolphins.

2584
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,280
(CHEERING)

2585
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:39,640
Palmer met some tennis player her
own age on the plane ride home,

2586
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,120
who's an even bigger fan of 'N Sync.

2587
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,440
And Maggie's about to start a three-week acting class

2588
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,760
with the actual Dolph Lundgren.

2589
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,800
And what happened for me?

2590
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,280
Well, I'm finally wearing my wedding ring for real.

2591
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:57,360
And now when women ask me about it,

2592
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,640
I'm gonna tell them I'm married to a woman

2593
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:02,440
who doesn't beat me, doesn't cheat on me,

2594
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:05,560
doesn't drink... Well, doesn't drink that much.

2595
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:08,520
And who I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.

2596
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,360
A woman named Katherine.

2597
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:14,720
Would you like to dance with
your wife, Doctor Maccabee?

2598
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,040
Yes, I would, Mrs. Maccabee.

2599
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:18,400
Yeah, it's okay.

2600
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,160
One more.

2601
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:25,200
(EXCLAIMS)

2602
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,520
You were right, Soul Patch is going hard on that bass.

2603
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:32,240
What did I tell you? Uh-huh.

2604
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:38,000
Hey. Encore, man. I'm just kidding. Stop.

2605
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,360
I get it. It is long and it's gross.

2606
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:48,200
You don't need wind for that thing to swing around.
