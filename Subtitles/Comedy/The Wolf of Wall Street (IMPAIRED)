1, 2, 3!

11
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,344
[ALL CHEERING]

12
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:29,477
Twenty five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bullseye!

13
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:32,356
come on! Let's go!

14
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:38,294
One, two, three!

15
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,357
My name is Jordan Belfort.

16
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:43,335
Not him, me.
That's right.

17
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,429
I'm a former member of the middle
class raised by two accountants

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,431
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.

19
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,242
The year I turned 26, as the
head of my own brokerage firm,

20
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,407
I make 49 million dollars.

21
00:01:55,448 --> 00:02:00,408
Which really pissed me off because
it was three shy of a million a week.

22
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:07,315
No, no, my Ferrari was white
like Don Johnson's in Miami Vice.

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,328
Not red.

24
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,291
See that humongous estate down
there?

25
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,360
That's my house.

26
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,262
My wife, Naomi.

27
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:25,505
The Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,
a former model and Miller Lite girl.

28
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:29,447
Yeah, she was the one loop my
cock in the mouth in the Ferrari.

29
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,316
So put your dick back in your pants.

30
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,253
In addition to Naomi and my two perfect kids,

31
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,482
I own a mansion, private jet,

32
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:44,294
six cars, three horses, two
vacation homes and a 170 foot yacht.

33
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:54,498
I also gamble like a degenerate, I drink like a
fish, I fuck hookers maybe five-six times a week.

34
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,442
I have three different Federal
agencies looking to indict me.

35
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,308
- Yeah, baby..
- Oh, yeah.

36
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,439
And I love drugs.

37
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,411
Okay..

38
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,353
- Oh, yeah..
- One more.

39
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,346
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,418
Later that night..

41
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,336
Pull up! Pull up! We're gonna
crash! For christ sake!

42
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,203
Come on!

43
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,402
Just relax!

44
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:41,253
Oh.. Fuck..
Are you okay?

45
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,312
Yeah, I'm alright.

46
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,289
- Alright, good.
- Good job.

47
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,257
Good..

48
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,452
You got in there save, alright?

49
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,485
- Until next time, brother.
- Until next time.

50
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,297
Yup, on a daily basis I consume
enough drugs to sedate Manhattan.

51
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,242
Long Island, and Queens.

52
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:04,505
For a month.

53
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,444
Oke, Mr. Jordan.

54
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,415
I take Quaaludes, 10-15 times a day,
for my back pain.

55
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,249
I had the role to stay focus.

56
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,413
Xanax to take the eye pot ot mellow me out,

57
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,255
Cocaine to wake me back up again,
and morphine, well..

58
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,248
Because it's awesome.

59
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,487
Good morning, Lycon.

60
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,395
But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven,

61
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:34,396
there's one that's my absolute favorite.

62
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:39,344
See? Enough of this
shit'll make you invincible.

63
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,438
Able to conquer the world.

64
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,314
And eviscerate you enemies.

65
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,353
And I'm not talking about this.

66
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,289
I'm talking about this.

67
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,453
The money doesn'tjust buy you a better life.

68
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,363
Better food, better car, better person.

69
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,424
It's also makes you a better person.

70
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,369
You can give generously to the
church or the political party

71
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:08,465
of your choice. You can save
the fucking spotted owl with money.

72
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,412
I always wanted to be rich.

73
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,505
So let me go back.

74
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:20,418
I'm 22 years old, newly married,
and already a money crisis little shit.

75
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,477
So what do I do?

76
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:27,357
I go to the one place on earth
that befit my high-minded ambitions..

77
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,431
You are lower than fucking pond scum.

78
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:47,470
You got problem with that?
Jordan?

79
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,505
- No, no problem at all.
- Good!

80
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,484
Because that's it what you are.
Pond scum.

81
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,249
You job is ''Connector'', which means

82
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,280
that you'll be dialing the
phone over 500 times a day.

83
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,293
Trying to connect me with
wealthy business owners.

84
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,388
And until you pass your Series 7,
that's all you gonna be fucking doing.

85
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,298
Sit. Sit!

86
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,336
Just so you know, last year
I made over $ 300.000.

87
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,431
The other guy you'll be
working for, he made over a million.

88
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:19,377
A million dollars? I can only imagine
what a douchebag that guy must be.

89
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:23,314
- Jordan Belfort? Mark Hanna.
- Yeah, sir.

90
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:25,307
- Pleasure to meet you.
- And you as well,

91
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,319
I see you already meet the village asshole.

92
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,411
Smile and dial.

93
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,321
And don't pick up your
fucking head until one.

94
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,382
Hey, fuck him.

95
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,451
I'm the senior broker here,
dia isjust a worthless piker.

96
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,360
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

97
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,423
I heard you really pitched a stock
in yourjob interview.

98
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:43,333
I had to do something to stand out, right, sir?

99
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,428
I fucking love that!

100
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,372
- Lunch, today.
- Ya, alright.

101
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:53,402
Oh, we don't start dinning at 9:30, because
our clients, they're already answering the phone.

102
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,313
3, 2, 1!

103
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,408
Let's fuck!

104
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,219
You want to know what money's sound like?

105
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,313
Go to the trading floor on wall street.

106
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,291
Fuck this shit that, cunt, cock, asshole.

107
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,261
I couldn't believe how this
guys talk to each other.

108
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,364
I was hooked within seconds.

109
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,433
It was like mainlining adrenaline.

110
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,333
Fuck face! Look where
you start at today, huh?

111
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,237
Motherfucker, you can't get anywhere,
and at 40..

112
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:22,298
- Pick up the cock sucking phone!
- Yes, sir.

113
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,276
- Yes, sir.
- Market has been raise well.

114
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,303
You are such a fucking dougchebag, Hanna.

115
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,338
We don't give to shit about
how technology work.

116
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,250
Because all we care about is
getting fucking rich!

117
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,277
- Solid!
- Jordan Belfort

118
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:37,517
I got it!

119
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,354
Time to play the tape!

120
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,327
Wow! a 20.000 Microsoft!

121
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:43,454
Go in the hole!

122
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:49,332
Come on! It's alive, it's alive.
I want you to hold on, that is hot.

123
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:53,304
Here! In, in! Shut that
motherfucker! Shut it! Shut it!

124
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,466
Salut!

125
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:22,391
Tootski?

126
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,403
Oh, no, no thank you, thou.

127
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,372
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for
you on this glorious afternoon?

128
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,273
Well, Hactor heres the game plan.

129
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:33,336
You gonna bring us two absolut
martinis, you know how I like em.

130
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:38,316
Straight up, and then precisely seven and a half
minute after that you gonna bring us two more,

131
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:44,483
And then two more after that every 5
minutes until one of us passes the fuck out.

132
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,321
An excellent strategy, sir.

133
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,384
Oh, I'm good with water for now, thou.

134
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,485
Thank you.

135
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,360
It's her first day on
wall street.

136
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,364
Give him time..

137
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,460
Thank you. Thank you.

138
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:02,374
Mr. Hanna, you're able to drugs
during the day and still function?

139
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,399
And still do yourjob?

140
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,275
Well, how the fuck else would you
do these job?

141
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,507
Cocaine and hookers, my friends.

142
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,447
Right..

143
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:15,285
I got to say, I'm incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm, I mean..

144
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,417
- Your.. The clients you have were absolutly..
- Talked the clients.

145
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:23,361
Your only responsibility is
to put meat on the table.

146
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,496
You got a girlfriend?

147
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,263
I'm new married, I have a wife,
his name Theresa. She cut hair.

148
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,428
- Congratulation.
- Thank you.

149
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,233
Think about Theresa.

150
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,366
Named a game, move the money from your
clients pocket.

151
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,273
into your pocket.

152
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:42,509
Right. But if you can make the clients
money, at the same time, isn't that
advantageous everyone, correct?

153
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:47,418
No, okay, number one rule of wall street.

154
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:52,447
Nobody.. Okay, if you Warren Buffet or Jimmy
Buffet, nobody knows.

155
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:56,393
If a stock's going up, down
orsideways fucking in circle,

156
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,363
At least of all stock brokers, right?

157
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,456
It's all in ''Furgazy''.
you know what Furgazy is?

158
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,263
Yeah, ''Furgazy''..
It's a fake..

159
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,397
Yeah, Furgazy, it's
fegazy, it's a wuzzy, it's..

160
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,373
Fairy dust, it doesn't exist.

161
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,434
It's never landed, that is no matter,
it's not on the elemental charge.

162
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:14,537
It's not fucking real! Alright?

163
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,479
Alright.

164
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,449
Stay with me.

165
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,419
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

166
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,353
- No.
- So, if you got a client.

167
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,414
who brought a stock at 8,
and now it's at 16.

168
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:28,257
He is all fucking happy, he is
want to cash it, and liquidate.

169
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,488
Take his fucking money and run home.

170
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,359
You don't let them do that.

171
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,365
- Okay.
- Because that would make it real.

172
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,300
- Right.
- Now, what do you do?

173
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,359
You got another brainer idea.

174
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,462
The special idea.

175
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:43,408
Another situation, another stock,
to reinvested his earning in this stock.

176
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,470
And he will, every single time.
As they're fucking addicted.

177
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,505
And you just keep doing this,
again, and again, and again.

178
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:54,213
Meanwhile, he think,
he is getting shit rich.

179
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:55,515
Which he's is, on papper.

180
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,386
But you and me, the brokers?

181
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,391
We taking the whole hot cash.

182
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,292
The via commision, motherfucker!

183
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,262
Right!

184
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,431
That's incredible, sir.

185
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,330
I can't tell you how excited I am.

186
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,334
You should be.

187
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:13,395
There is two keys, to success,
in broker business.

188
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,464
First of all..

189
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,436
- You gotta stay relax..
- Yeah.

190
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:25,246
- You jerk off?
- Do I jerk off? Yeah.

191
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,309
Yeah, I jerk off, yeah.

192
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,286
How many time a week?

193
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,481
Like, 3-4 time, maybe..

194
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,290
Gotta pump those numbers out, those
are rookie numbers in this racket.

195
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:39,355
I, myself, I jerk off, at least twice a day.

196
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,263
- Wow!
- Once in the morning.

197
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,394
Right after I work out,
and then once right after the lunch.

198
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,368
Really?

199
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,464
Well, I want to,
that's not the way I do it.

200
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:50,408
I do it, because I fucking need to.

201
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,468
Think about you doing with numbers,
all day long.

202
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:57,380
Desk more point, high frequensy, bang-bang.

203
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:02,480
Fucking digits kick, kick, kick,
and all very asidick above the shoulders.

204
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,453
Right?

205
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,390
You can't go weeks the people out.

206
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,393
Right? You got to feed the gizz
to keep the blood flowing.

207
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,419
And keep the ryhtme below the belt.

208
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,430
Done.

209
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,365
This is not a tip, this is
a perscription. Trust me.

210
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,369
If you don't, you'll fall out the balance.

211
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,462
Glicth your differasion,
and the tip fuck over.

212
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,461
Or more shit.

213
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,462
I've seen this happen.

214
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,496
In blood.

215
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,305
- No, I don't want blooded, sir.
- No.

216
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,336
- No you don't. Ya.
- I in for a long run, you know?

217
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,506
- Implusion are ugly.
- Ya.

218
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,278
Pop off to the bathroom,
work on that anytime you can.

219
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,272
And when you get really good at it.

220
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,412
You'll be fucking stroking it,
and you'll be thinking about money.

221
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,415
Second key.

222
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,413
To success.

223
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:43,451
In this rackets, is this little
baby right here, it's called Cocaine.

224
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,394
Right.

225
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,421
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.

226
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,230
You'll also got your finger dial faster.

227
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:50,361
And guess what.

228
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,370
That's good for me.

229
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,339
Yes, sir.

230
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,307
- Revolution, you follow?
- Revolution.

231
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,470
Keep the client on the fairys will.

232
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,346
And it goes, the park is open 24/7365.

233
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,409
Every decade, every goddamn century.

234
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,318
That's it.

235
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,345
Named the game.

236
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,347
How tickity?

237
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,293
Mmm... Thank you.

238
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,496
Come on.

239
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,240
With combine of dominator

240
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,217
Keep that for me.

241
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,518
# The CEO

242
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,492
# Had the money comes in

243
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,517
# The pray comes down.

244
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,462
# Going down to Broadway.

245
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,431
# It's a one way street.

246
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,490
# Which is a way I go.

247
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,466
For the next six months I got to know
in and out of Wall Street.

248
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:07,343
Earning shit money, as I
gear up, to take my series 7.

249
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:14,343
Ow! Oh God!
That was..

250
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:24,419
Then I was an licensed brooker at last.

251
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,455
Ready to make my fotune.

252
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:31,492
My first day as a future
master of the universe.

253
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,266
October 19, 1987.

254
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,245
I've X on 86 from six month ago.

255
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,306
Today is draining to 36 in the half.

256
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,375
Mr. Buns! Mr..

257
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,479
They called it, The black monday.

258
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:56,358
No shit, by 4 PM, the market
has dropped 508 poin.

259
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,354
The biggest plomits since the crash of 29.

260
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,229
I know you family,
you know mine!

261
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,202
No, I don't know, from fucking
country are you or shit.

262
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,328
Let them do what they want fucking do.

263
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,303
Our market are out.

264
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,239
Sir, this is not something you want to sale!

265
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,265
You know what happened?
A fucking Tsunami.

266
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,375
Yeah, I.. Yes, I will talk to your wife.

267
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,280
You not answering the phone,
alot of people gonna be calling you.

268
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,339
Trying to get your dirty laundy.

269
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,407
You don't know what's going on here.

270
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,408
I know, I know.

271
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:36,367
Holy fucking shit.

272
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,436
Unbelieveable..

273
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,303
My first shity day as a brooker.

274
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:48,440
Within a month, L.F. Rothschild, an institution
since 1899, closed it's doors.

275
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,441
Wall street did swallow me up,
and shit me right back out again.

276
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,514
We can pawn our engagement ring.

277
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,383
If we needed to.

278
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,483
- Baby..
- Beside that is mine..

279
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,427
- If we need to, I'm just saying.. Okay.
- You listen to me..

280
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,488
You're not pawning anything, okay?

281
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,294
- Okay.
- What I always tell you?

282
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,357
You going to be a millionaire.

283
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:12,394
That's right, okay? So let me look,
I'll find something.

284
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,269
- How about this?

285
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,365
''Nobody beats the wiz''

286
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,466
Electronic store, stock boy.
What'd you think?

287
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,273
You not gonna work at that place.

288
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,508
- Yeah, but you know, you start off..
- Jordan, you're gonna be miserable at that place.

289
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,445
If you go there.

290
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,473
It's sales, it work a way out,
I'd be a gentleman.

291
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,313
You're not gonna be stock boy.

292
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,479
- Why not?
- Because you are a Stock brooker.

293
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,354
Do you understand there is nobody
hiring stock brooker right now?

294
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,482
You understand that?

295
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,458
Okay?

296
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,262

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,520
Of course you never have it,

00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,275

00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,376
Jordan, what do you get
from that Blue Chip stock?

354
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,216
I make 1 percent.

355
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,415
Well, I didn't make 1 percent.

356
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,481
Pink sheets is 50.

357
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,223
It's 50 percent?

358
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,489
50 percent commission?

359
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,431
- Yeah.

360
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,458
It's our market price services.

361
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:37,237
So if I sells stock at $ 10.000,
my commission is $ 5.000?

362
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:42,475
If you sell $ 10.000 worth on this stock, I
will personaly give you a blow job for free.

363
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,441
And I hope it's happens.

364
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,253
Hallo, John, how are you doing today?

365
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,484
You mailed my company a post card
for a few week back.

366
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,459
requesting information on Peny stock
that had huge upside potential?

367
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:58,327
With very little down side risks.
Is that ringing a bell?

368
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,354
Oh, yeah, I interesting on that.

369
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,262
Okay, great.

370
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,392
Well, the reason for the call today, John, is..

371
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:08,362
Something just come across my desk,
John, it is a packs is the best thing
I've seen in all last 6 month.

372
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,376
If you have 60 seconds, I'll like to share
the idea with you, you got minute?

373
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,310
- Say it, I really interesting on that.
- Name of the company..

374
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,372
Aerotyne International, it is
a cutting edge high tech firm,

375
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,476
Out of the midwest.
Awaiting imminent path approvall

376
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,515
On a next generation of radar detectors that had
both huge military and survilliance application.

377
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:31,394
Now, right now, John, the stock trade
over the count of 10 cent a share.

378
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,488
And by the way, John.

379
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:36,297
Our analysis indicated it can go
way hack of lot higher than that.

380
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:42,365
Your profit, on a mare $ 6.000 investment,
would be up to $ 60.000.

381
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,308
- Jesus! That's my Mortage, man.
- Exactly.

382
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,469
You could pay off your mortage.

383
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,240
This stock would be safe, right?

384
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,374
John, one thing I can promise you,
even in this market.

385
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,509
Is that I never asked my
clients to judge me on my wins

386
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:57,488
I asked them to judge me on my loses,
becuase I have so few.

387
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,354
And in the case of Aerotyne.

388
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:02,293
Based on every technical
factor out there, John.

389
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,422
We're looking at the grandslam homerun.

390
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,522
Okay, let's do it.

391
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,294
I'll do $ 4.000.

392
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,392
$ 4.000, that'll be $ 40.000 share, John.

393
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,394
Let me lock in that trade right now,
and get back to my secretary

394
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,463
with exact information,
sound good, John?

395
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,441
- Yeah, that's sound good.
- Great.

396
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,241
Hei, John, thank you for
your vote of confidence.

397
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,439
And welcome to the Investor Center.

398
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,347
- Yeah, thanks alot, man.
- Bye-bye.

399
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,321
How'd you fucking do that?

400
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,220
Just like that I made 2 grand.

401
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,456
The other guys looked at me like
I just discovered 5.

402
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,423
Great! Even better!

403
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,490
I'm selling garbage to garbageman.

404
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,501
And making cash hand over the fish.

405
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,494
the only problem you can have
is you can't buy more.

406
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,234
Boom shoot!

407
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,331
So I was salling them shit.

408
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,239
Way to go!

409
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,300
The way I looked at it.

410
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,402
Their money was better off from my pocket.

411
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,504
I knew how to spend it better.

412
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,311
Excuse me.

413
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:58,509

414
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,280

- It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.

416
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,520

417
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,318

418
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,383

457
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,315
Don't tell fucking Susan,
It's not her business.

458
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,479
And there is another thing about him too,
like his phosphorescent white teeth

459
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,283
Wife? I gotta fucking deal with you wife?

460
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:47,314
and the fact that he wore horn rims
with clear lensesjust to look more Waspy.

461
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,488
Then with these rumors

462
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:53,225
I've heard some stupid shit,
I don't know..

463
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,459
Look, I don't want to bring it out.

464
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,331
This isjust stupid.

465
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:57,357
It's was with me?

466
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:02,499
You know, people say shit, I don't know,
I didn't listen to them talk.

467

Every person you had on phone, they want to
get rich, and they want get rich quickly.

569
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,476

00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:46,354
Yeah, there is one time, that I
was selling a pot, on this Amish dude,

You know this guy, he got like a beard..

581
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,284
They did buying shit.

I'm not talking about Buddhas
or Amish.

00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:32,320
Chaster the creep chinaman, though
jitjitsu was in Israel.

620
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,422
The smartest from a bunch,
was Nicky Kascov.

621
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:36,332
He actually went to law school.

622
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:40,326
I called him, Rugred, because
of his piece of shit hair piece.

623
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:44,239
Still give them to me,
young, hungry, and stupid.

624
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,472
And in no time, I'm make them rich.

625
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:50,475
Oh, my God.

626
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,348
- Jordan that..
- You like it, baby?

627
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,478
Ya, I mean, it's beautiful.

628
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,422
They're not the biggest stone in the world,
but I promised they're really high quality.

629
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:03,360
It beautiful.. I..
That so beautiful..

630
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:04,520

631
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,498
- What?

632
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,501
- What is it? Go ahead..
- I don't know.. It's you know..

633
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:15,404
This stock that this company..
They're.. They're like crappy companies.

634
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:17,306
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

635
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:18,502
Yeah, they're terrible.

636
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:22,246
Don't worry about it, I've told you,
what I'm doing is completely legal.

637
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,410
Yeah, I know, but they're still not
gonna making more money, thou, right?

638
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,309
Well, sometime they do, sometimes they don't.

639
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,411
You know, how it goes.

640
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,355
Well, won't you feel better if you
sell this to rich people

641
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,484
who making fortune from their money?

642
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,362
Of course.

643
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:41,297
But rich people
didn't buy penny stocks.

644
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,527
They're just don't.

645
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,263
Why not?

646
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,362
Because they're too smart.

647
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,430
That's why not.

648
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,375
I mean, what person that collage education.

649
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,368
Will trust this bunch of jerkoff.

650
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,310
Tell him to call back!

651
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,372
- We have 5 fucking grand on, right now.
- Hey!

652
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,384
But what if they didn't sound like
a bunch of jerkoff?

653
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:04,252
What if I can teach them how
to sell to the people with money.

654
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,257
Real money.

655
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,350
So I decided to reinvented the company.

00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,455
With a new name.

671
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,366
A company, that our clients can believe in.

672
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,303
A company that our clients can trusted.

673
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,272
A firm whoes roots,

674
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,399
are so deeply in betting on wall street.

675
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,410
That our very founders..

676
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,344
Sale over of the mail flower.

677
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:05,373
And chizel the name Stratton Oakmont
right into a fucking rock!

678
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,281
You got it?

679
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,250
What are we gonna do are these.

680
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:12,347
First we pitch them Dysney, TNT, IBM.

681
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,381
Blue Chip Stock's exclusively.

682
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,451
Companies this people know.

683
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,394
Once we sucked them in.

684
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,489
We unload the dark shit.

685
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,296
The pink sheets. The penny stocks.

686
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,426
Where we make the money.

687
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:27,268
50 %% commission, baby.

688
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,274
Now the key to making money
in this situation like this.

689
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,243
Is the position of yourself
now before the settlement.

690
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,474
Because the time we read it
on the wall streetjournal.

691
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,346
It's already too late.

692
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,351
And you wait.

693
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,318
You wait.

694
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,252
And whoever speak first.

695
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,448
Loses.

696
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,519
Sorry, I.. I appriciate the call..

697
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,256
I really had to give this some thought.

698
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,230
And go talk to my wife about it.

699
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,288
Em, can I call you back?

700
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,492
They don't know, right?
They got to think about.

701
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,400
They are gonna talk to his fucking
wife, to the fucking tooth fairy.

702
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,268
The point is doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

703
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:03,467
The only real objection of what
they have is they don't trust you guys.

704
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,442
Why should they trust you,
I mean, looked at you.

705
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,377
You're bunch of slazy salesman, right?

706
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,313
So, what do you say?

707

716
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:34,238
I'm complete agree with you,
you don't know me, I don't know you.

717
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:36,365

719
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,267
I'm senior vice-president in Stratton Oakmont.

00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,439
And I planned to being on of the top brookers
at my firm in the next year.

721
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,416
And I not gonna get there by being
below of standard.

722
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,511
I won't say that, you sound like..
You sound like sincerely guy.

723
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:52,387
Because I'm gonna make you rich,
and it's not gonna make you poor.

724
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,449
But what Stratton will do in it's serving

725
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:57,223
is bend the mark for future busines, Kevin.

726
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,353
You feel comfortable with me now, Scotty?

727
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:02,389
And then you'll know, for sure, that you

And who can consitetly make you money.

Sound fair enough?

731

735
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:25,449
Kevin, you give me one shot here
on the blue chips stock like Kodak.

736
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:30,484
And believe me, Kevin, the
only problem you're gonna have,

737
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:35,398
is that you didn't buy more, sounds fair enough?

738
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,303
Shit, well...

739
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:46,243
Ah... My wife might divorce me,
but yeah, let's do it. Oh, yeah.

740
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,474
Excellent choice, Kevin, how
much you wanna go for this time?

741
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,448
- Let's do $5.000 dollars or something...
- We'll try $8.000, Kevin.

742
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,317

What a fucking idiot.

750
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:23,209
The one thing I know about

Just say I'm wrong, and the stock goes down...

757
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:43,460
I make you in the words of my grandfather,
God rests his soul in a shit tons of money.

758
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:47,437

Let's get the party started!

773
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:49,325
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

774
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:55,499
FYI boys, Danielle promised to use her $10.000
for breast implant, she already got C cups,

775
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,270
but now she wants fucking double D!

776
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:01,506
Is this a great fucking comedy or what?

777
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:07,307
This is the place to be the wild!

778
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,417
Done it! Blow the roof of this motherfucker!

779
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,290
Do it!

780
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,372
Word about us spread through out Wallstreet.

781
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,484
Even to places I didn't wanted to.

782
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,488
Wasn't long before Forbes Magazine, the flagship
of Wallstreet call to do a profile on me.

783
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,298
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future, for Stratton Oakmont?

784
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,304
We'll work...

785
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,339
- Diversification.
- Sounds good.

786
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,310
Thank you so much, I have more
than enough, I appreciate your time.

787
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,278
- Fantastic!
- Can we get a quick picture?

788
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,439
A total fucking hatchetjob.

789
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:21,349
This knitting little twad! Look at this!

790
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,344
''The Wolf of Wallstreet,'' they call me. Look!

791
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,221
- Your hair looks good. Yeah.
- My hair looks good.

792
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,350
Jordan Belfort...
(pushing dicey stock)

793
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:32,351
sounding like a kind of ''Twisted
Robin Hood,'' who takes from the rich...

794
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:36,355
and gives to himself and his merry little
band of brokers. Read that, read it.

795
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:41,303
Listen, there is no such thing
as bad publicity, sweet heart.

796
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,533
- Big article, babe.
- Jordan, you look great.

797
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,265
You're in a huge magazine.

798
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,331
The fucking deal I will.

799
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:48,345
Mr. Belfort! Just give me a chance!

800
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,246
Mr. Belfort! Excuse me, excuse me, Sir!

801
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:54,274
[CROWD]

802
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,445
Shut the fuck up!

803
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,276
What's all this?

804
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,223
It's the Forbes article, they
all want to work for you now.

805
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,282
Hey! What did I say?

806
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:06,360
Hey! You want a job, you talk to me!

807
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:10,231
- Mr. Belfort!
- Forbes make me a superstar.

808
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:16,270
Everyday, dozens of money craze
kids be the path to my door.

809
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,432
If we hired them, they drop
straight outta college overnight...

810
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,504
and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Stratton taylor.

811
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,277
Are you fucking serious right now?

812
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,445
I mean we were literally putting
clothes on these kids backs,

813
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,456
And here comes thisjerk off snffing around.

814
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,290
But you know, everytime
someone rises up in this world,

815
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:39,490
there's always gonna be some
asshole trying to drag him down.

816
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:45,458
Within months we doubled in size
and move into even bigger offices.

817
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,471
It was a mad house.

818
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:59,541
A greed fest, with equal parts,
cocaine, testoterone and body fluids.

819
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,409
Yeah!

820
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:07,357
It got so bad, I had to declare the office a
fuck free zone between the hours of 9 and 7.

821
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,415
But I'm counting even that didn't enough.

822
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,491
Actually the madness started
on our very first day.

823
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,488
When one of our brokers Ben
Jenner, christens the elevator,

824
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,400
by getting a blowjob from a sales assistant.

825
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:22,498
Her name was Pam and her credit,
she did have this amazing technique,

826
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:26,237
with this wild, twist and jerk motion.

827
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:29,269
By the month later, Donnie
and I decided to double team...

828
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,239
on a saturday afternoon while our wives
were out shopping for Christmas dresses..

829
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,386
Eventually Ben marriage,
that which was pretty amazing,

830
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,221
considering she blew every
single guy in the office.

831
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,383
He ain't got the present and
killed himself 3 years later.

832
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:47,490
Anyway I hired my Dad, Max to
maintain order as The Enforcer.

833
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,432
Stratton very own Gestapo.

834
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,327
We called him ''Mad Max. '' because
of his hair trigger temper.

835
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:58,364
Which could be set off by something as
obnoxious as a ringing telephone.

836
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:05,279
Who the fuck has the Goddamn ball to
call this house on a tuesday night?

837
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,250
Goddamn it!

838
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:08,273
You're gonna missed it!

839
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,287
Oh, please, tell me something I don't know!

840
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,313
I wait all wek for The fucking Equalizer!

841
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,349
And I have to fucking... Hello?

842
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,292
But as soon as he picked up the phone...

843
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:18,454
Jean? How are you Jean?

844
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:20,463
He defect his weird British accent.

845
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:24,230
Why, yeah, Jean, that would be great. Cherio!

846
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,360
It was absolutely bizarre.

847
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,460
Fucking half wit!

848
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:30,269
- And hang up and then he's Mad Max all over again
- You missed it!

849
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,433
Damn!

850
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,240
What, tell me what happened, what happened?

851
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,269
Well, he discovered it was the Mother's sister.

852
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,245
Who's he? Who?

853
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,339
- Tell me who he is?
- The main guy.

854
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,247
- You know who the main guy,
- The main guy...

855
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,219
it was his Mother sister, she showed up dead.

856
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,456
Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know
everything we were doing at Stratton.

857
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:51,450
Then there's a big target and we...
They get lunge at the target, they stick.

858
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,226
There's a bulls eye and the
bulls eye a dollar sign,

859
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,357
whoever gets close to the dollar
sign gets the most points.

860
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,232
I so full of this shit of
this little fucking thing.

861
00:43:58,268 --> 00:43:59,292
Yeah, you have to hear yourself talk.

862
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,395
So, if he gets hurt, what happens?

863
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:01,461
Yeah, we're gonna a get fucking knock.

864
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:05,236
I don't think he's gonna get hurt, they're like...
They got like super human strenght.

865
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:06,333
I think he's gonna be fine.

866
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,311
You can't look him right in the eyes.

867
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,471
You can't look him at in the eye?

868
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,310
That's a fact, I saw it on PBS.

869
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,373
They get confuse, their they wires get cross.

870
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:17,319
You gotta look like, the chin Like it's looks like
I'm looking at you, but I'm looking at your chin.

871
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,221
I feel like you addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

872
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:23,249
They're like The Monalisa, they find eye
contact, like wherever you standing in the room,

873
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:24,385
the minute they lock in, you know.

874
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,420
No, but there is a limit to
what we could do with them.

875
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:30,263
I mean, we're allowed to throw shit at em'.
We allowed to throw food, bananas...

876
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,289
I know crack button.

877
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,270
But, for example, what I wouldn't do
is maybe like tell the police cock out.

878
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:37,273
and like to get some of the girls
to, you know... Fun or shit like that.

879
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,241
- That would be... That's unacceptable.
- I mean we can, let's keep that in our pocket.

880
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:41,369
But this guy is more about
thrown, thrown at the dartboard?

881
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:42,436
Correct, yes, yes.

882
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,212
The thing is this is their gift, okay?
They're built to be thrown like a long dart.

883
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,309
They're top heavy like a long
dart, so they're built for accuracy.

884
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,445
Oh, My God, this is...
Can we bowl with this guy?

885
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,512
That's his fucking brother, Robbie.
He brothers the bowling ball.

886
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,323
The brother you put a skateboard on,
strapped him onto a skateboard.

887
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,486
you toss him down on alley at some pins.

888
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,257
No shit, that's intersesting.

889
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,354
- Can we get that guy?
- We can get, we'll get that guy too.

890
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,366
But it says here, this guy will show his cock.

891
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,265
Yeah, instead of going up, yeah.

892
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:08,261
They are very armory, by the way, so you
gotta be very careful with these little guys.

893
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:10,273
Safety first, safety is first, alright?

894
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:13,401
I want somebody with a fucking tranquilizer
gun, ready to knock this fucker out.

895
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,503
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace tasers gun.

896
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:17,309
A pellet gun manybe? Just like the...

897
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,282
No, pellet gun, is gonna hurt him,
I just want him out, knocked out cold

898
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,514
I say we stick with the loophole, right, okay?

899
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,517
We don't considered him a human,
we just considered it an act.

900
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:28,491
I think we're in the clear, like a flying,
you know a lot of those guys died.

901
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,514
but they never sued anybody.

902
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,285
The important thing, you
guys gotta keep in mind is...

903
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:35,288
is that these things gossip,
they get together and they gossip.

904
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,526
- It's a good point.
- And the last thing that we need is...

905
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,430
them getting together and then saying ''Oh,
listen, they made fun of us'' like...

906
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,372
- like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.
- That's why I love you.

907
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,374
You think of shit like that.

908
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:45,398
That is a come in?

909
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,467
We treat itjust like one of us, okay?

910
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:51,242
One of us, we're gonna treat them like one of us!

911
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:54,375
We accept that one of us, we're
gonna treat them like one of us!

912
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,386
We accept that one of us, we're
gonna treat them like one of us!

913
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,410
Jordan!

914
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:00,287
Your Dad's coming, something
about The American Express bill?

915
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,383
- Hey, can you get him outta here? I'm not...
- Yeah, lick my toe.

916
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,326
No, I'm serious, get...

917
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,521
Fuck! Okay, guys, act like we're working on stuff.

918
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,399
Okay, he's coming, he's coming.

919
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:10,491
Make some shit off.

920
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,468
I think we're short at visor...

921
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:17,473
$430.000 dollars in one month, Jordy, huh?

922
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:23,276
Four hundred and fucking thirty thousand
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

923
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,281
Good morning, they're businness expenses, relax!

924
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,477
Business expenses? Jordy, look what you got here!

925
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,416
- What?
- Look at this,

926
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,320
$26.000 dollars for one fucking dinner!

927
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,290
Okay, no, no, no this could be explained.

928
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,452
Dad, we had client, we have the Visa client.

929
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,358
Right, the porter house from Argentina.

930
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,420
The expensive champagne and
wine, we have to buy champagne...

931
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,262
And you go it all the fucking sides.
Tel him about the sides order.

932
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,358
- I ordered the sides, so...
- Sides?

933
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:48,235
Sides? $26.000 dollars, worth the sides?

934
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,329
What are this sides? That cures cancer?

935
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,242
This sides did cure cancer, that's the
problem, that's why they were expensive.

936
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:55,438
- Shut the fuck up!
- I'm serious...

937
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,377
- I know...
- Stop!

938
00:46:56,413 --> 00:47:00,440
EJ Entertainment, what the
fuck is EJ Entertainment?

939
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,283
Well, that's a...

940
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,254
- Jordan what's EJ entertainment?
- How I describe this...

941
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:08,252
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

942
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:10,453
- That's what it is!
- That's... That is what it is.

943
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,394
That's the perfect decription for it!

944
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,296
It is what it is, but none
of this were charge to me,

945
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,492
This is all of them.

946
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:17,465
Oh, that was all of us.

947
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,368
It wasn't me though, fucking
explain the shit to him!

948
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,429
These all of your fucking charges right here!

949
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,441
You guys, The IRS, they
allow for T&A, it's fine.

950
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:28,501
- T&A, T&A?
- Yeah, I said T&E.

951
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:30,445
- No, no you said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

952
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,244
- Yeah you did, you say T&A!
- When did I say that?

953
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,250
It's T&E, alright?

954
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:38,381
I know you're upset about the dinner and that
make sense because we did spend too much money.

955
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,389
But I said T&E...

956
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,391
Don't tell me what you
said, I heard what you said.

957
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,357
- I...
- Dad, he said T&A.

958
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,417
- Yeah, he said T&A.
- Yeah, absolutely no question. I heard it.

959
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:45,359
Jordan, I'm trying too...

960
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,386
- I'm fucking sweating.
- I'm getting this close.

961
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:48,226
- Dad, relax!
- I'm getting this close!

962
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,426
That's what I'm saying, why you open up more, Max?

963
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,399
He's gonna fucking kill you.

964
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:55,269
Why do you hold it in? Max, why do you hold it in?

965
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,263
That's it, that's it! Get the fuck out!

966
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,365
- No, no, no, no!
- Hold on!

967
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,399
Get out asshole!

968
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,412
- What kind of hooker takes credit card?
- A rich one!

969
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,210
At Stratton, there were 3 kinds of hookers,

970
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,341
the blue chips, top of the line, model material.

971
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:12,254
They cost between $300-$500 and you had to
wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip.

972
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,483
Which of course I always did.

973
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,357
Then came the Nasdaq, who are pretty not great.

974
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:19,488
They cost between $200 and $300 bucks.

975
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,327
Finally there were the pink sheets skanks.

976
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,266
They cost about $100 or less.

977
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,361
And if you didn't wear a condom, you have
to get a pennicilin shot the next day...

978
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,269
and pray your dick didn't fall off.

979
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:31,264
Not that we didn't fuck them too.

980
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,401
Believe me, we did.

981
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:36,276
Aw! I slip this thing again.

982
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,406
I know what it is, you know too much...

983
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,449
with EJ Entertainment.

984
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,248
- Pops...
- How are things at home?

985
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:47,314
Well, not the best, she just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

986
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:52,488
It's like this smell, a smell, there's attraction
thing and after a while itjust kinda fades away.

987
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,363
- Yeah, well it supposed to fade away.
- Supposed to?

988
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,230
- That's marriage, you know...
- That so...

989
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,428
- Your Mother and I we've been
married a long long time. - I know

990
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,438
What do you think? We, we, we...
jumpin' into bed every 2 minutes?

991
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,465
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death, I want to stay married, but

992
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:10,402
It's crazy out there, some of these
girls. You should see them, oh my God.

993
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:16,442
They're fucking... The things they doing
now, Pops, I mean it's on a whole new level.

994
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,351
- Really?
- And they're all shaved too.

995
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:19,355
Get outta here!

996
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,220
- All shaved and nice.
- Are you kidding me?

997
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:24,227
- Yeah, bald as a China doll.
- No bush? No bush?

998
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,489
- No bush, I know...
- Oh, My God.

999
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,394
All of the sudden like, one week...

1000
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:30,332
- Nobody had anything down there anymore.
- It's a new world.

1001
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,336
- They bald from the eyebrows down.
- Wow.

1002
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:36,362
- Nothing, not a stitches, like lasers.
- Wow. New world.

1003
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:40,309
I was born too... Too early.

1004
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,368
I've never been a fan of the bush to be honest.

1005
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:43,504
- Really?
- Yeah.

1006
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,276
I don't mind it.

1007
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,443
Dad, I don't want you
stressin' out about any of this.

1008
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:51,387
How can I not get stressed out? Look at
the knuckle heads you got working for you.

1009
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:55,323
I know they're knuckle head, but I need
them to want to live like me, you get it?

1010
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,224
To live like me.

1011
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:02,288
Jordy, one of these days, the
chickens are gonna come home to roost.

1012
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:05,495
You looking at me like I'm crazy.

1013
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:09,232
Crazy? This is obscene.

1014
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:15,370
It was obscene, in the normal world.
I mean who the fuck wanted to live there?

1015
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,313
The party are fucking cast off!

1016
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:36,322
We got planes up here, that's gonna take
this company into the fucking stratosphere!

1017
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:42,337
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

1018
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,241
Fuck Lynch, fuck them!

1019
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:48,335
Why should they be taking all of our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1020
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,436
That's why we became underrun.

1021
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:54,507
It was our next big move, finding
companies to take public, IPO's.

1022
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,478
It was the only way this Wallstreet pricks...

1023
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,456
would ever stop thinking of us
as some shit kick a bucket shot.

1024
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,254
We got an unclip international.

1025
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:07,355
See we're a little different, we like to get as
fucked up as possible during our businness powers.

1026
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,491
in order to stimulate our free flowing ideas.

1027
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:13,264
Which is why we're popping
this ludes like they were M&M's.

1028
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:14,496
You mad...

1029
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,500
We own the fucking company...
We own the company...

1030
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,534
Don't know what a ludes is?
I'll tell you.

1031
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,236
Wait, wait, wait...

1032
00:51:24,281 --> 00:51:29,378
Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie, right now.

1033
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:06,354
The Quaalude or lude as it commonly referred to,

1034
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:11,520
was first synthetize in 1951 by an
Indian doctor, that's not feathers.

1035
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:17,364
as a sedative and was prescribed to
stressed out house wife with sleep disorders.

1036
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:23,462
But pretty soon, someone figured out that if you
resist the urges to sleep forjust 15 minutes...

1037
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,442
you got a prety kick ass high from it.

1038
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:30,378
Didn't take long for people to
start abusing ludes of course.

1039
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:35,373
And in 1982 The U.S Government scheduled
one of them along with the rest of the world.

1040
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:39,347
Which meant there's only a
finite amount of this things left.

1041
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:45,520
No shit, you can't even buy them
anymore, you people all shit out of luck.

1042
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:49,493
- Steve Madden...
- Steve Madden.

1043
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,428
- Steve...
- Steve.

1044
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,232
You remember those ads?

1045
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:58,331
Those giant headed girls with the bug eyes,
wearing those big clunky shoes?

1046
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:02,311
- My friend from school, Steve Madden.
- His friend from school, Steve Madden.

1047
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,246
Steve Madden was the name
in women shoes at the moment...

1048
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:08,376
and all of Wallstreet was begging
to take his company public.

1049
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,283
Go ahead, what is it?

1050
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,379
- Except, guess who grew up with them?
- Women shoes!

1051
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:13,480
Women shoes.

1052
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,288
My very own Vice President.

1053
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,258
Women shoes.

1054
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,354
Diamond Donnie Azoff.

1055
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:23,230
- Madden... Steve...
- Steve.

1056
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,333
Jordy, Jordy, Jordy, Jordy... You
better come check this fucking chic' out.

1057
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:27,394
Look at this, look there.

1058
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,245
- That was hot.
- That girl, if she was my sister,

1059
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:39,373
I would let that girl give me fucking 8.

1060
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,475
Can the wolf handle it?

1061
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,216
She's hot!

1062
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,256
Christy...

1063
00:53:51,528 --> 00:53:54,292
Jordan, this is my friend, Naomi.

1064
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,356
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1065
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,525
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1066
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,226
Nice to meet you, you got an awesome place here.

1067
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,397
I don't think I've ever been

How many times you gonna ask
her, if she's never on a jetski?

1077
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,316
I don't know, I might ask

1078
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:23,417
Okay...

Just tell her I'll be there in couple of minutes.

1082
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,362
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1083
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,202
How am I gonna do that? While
I'm having a conversation...

1084
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,434
You know what? I think we should get going.

1085
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,272
Wait, wait, where you guys going?

1086
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,402

00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:43,469
- No, no, yeah stay for a drink.

1088
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,313
No, no, we got to other parties
we supposed to get to, so...

1089
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,314
Why don't you let her stay for a while?

1090
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,410
- Let her stay for a while, what's the big deal?
- Perfect...

1091
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,478
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1092
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,252
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1093
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,400
You gonna have to excuse my friend, he gets...

1094
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:09,405
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Jordan, you gotta fuck her, she so hot!

1095
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:16,403
Fuck you Donnie, let him finish
it Hildy, that's fucking rude.

1096
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,510
So, Bay Ridge. That's near Staten Island, right?

1097
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,347
Brooklyn across The Verrazano bridge.

1098
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,448
- Southern island territory.
- That's right.

1099
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:32,360
You mean gulge, go to Verrazano
bridge and see the plank.

1100
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:35,330
Right, so I presumed you're Italian?

1101
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:41,271
On my Dad side, I'm also Dutch,
German, English, I'm a mutt.

1102
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,274
- You're a mutt?
- Yeah, I still have family over there, in London.

1103
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:49,403
My Aunt Emma, she's the
best, very British you know?

1104
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:52,347
- She's a classy lady.
- That explains it then.

1105
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,349
Explains what?

1106
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:58,310
Explains you, I mean you're Duchess, right?
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1107
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,519
Excuse me, can I get a straw, please?

1108
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:07,490
Thank you.

1109
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,270
So, I was a little surprise
you ask Christy for my number.

1110
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,373
Why is that?

1111
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:22,404
Aren't you married?

1112
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:27,511
Well, yeah, but what? Married
people can't have friends?

1113
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:32,285
We're gonna be friends?

1114
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,517
Yeah. You don't wanna be my friend?

1115
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,331
We're not gonna be friends.

1116
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,467
And then I worked on my designs.

1117
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:58,379
I have an entire an entire line of
lingerie, camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1118
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:03,443
She designs woman panties too? Oh, My God!

1119
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:16,423
Come on Jordan, think of a
way to get up to her apartment.

1120
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,407
You want to come up for some tea or something?

1121
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:28,343
Tea? Yeah, like hot tea?

1122
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:30,346
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, sounds nice, yeah.

1123
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,213
Tea, fuck yeah I wanna come up for tea.

1124
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:36,480
Like rosehips or something like that.

1125
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,350
This is Rocky.

1126
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,388
- Who is this? say hi, Rocky.
- Hi, sweet heart.

1127
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:46,488
- Okay. - Why don't you light a fire or
something, I'll be right out.

1128
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:49,293
- Yeah, fire, yeah.
- Sure.

1129
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:54,495
I like your painting, it's uh...

1130
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,243
God, help me how do I fuck this girl?

1131
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:11,410
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, yeah I just try to light the fire in here.

1132
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:20,353
That's it, that's it! You leave and
don't get involved, go home to your wife.

1133
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:34,376
As you can probably guess, I
fuck her Goddamn brains out!

1134
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,242
Oh, Jesus Lord!

1135
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,307
For 11 seconds.

1136
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:55,295
- Did you just cum?
- Oh, yeah I just came.

1137
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,392
- Did you? Did you cum?
- No.

1138
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,366
No?

1139
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:03,396
Okay, I'm still hard, just give me a second.

1140
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,270
- Sure.
- Yeah...

1141
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,243

1142
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,404
Hold me, oh yeah... Oh yeah...

1143
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:21,348
- Oh, God!
- Fuck off, Rocky!

1144
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,382
- Do you have biscuits or something like that?
- It's okay.

1145
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,359
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1146
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,420
Gom play Rocky, go, go...

1147
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,291
- You're crazy.
- I couldn't get enough.

1148
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:35,236
I mean her pussy was like heroin to me.

1149
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:38,501
And it wasn'tjust about the sex
either, Naomi and I got along.

1150
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,476
I mean we... We had similiar interest in shits.

1151
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,477

00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,295

1154
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:10,370

1155
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,372

1163
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:46,273
- Jesus Christ!
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1164
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,470
I thought you're at the fucking beach!
i didn't know you were here.

1165
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:52,413
That's who you fucking been?
With that fucking whore from the party?

1166
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,437
What are you doing here? I
thought you were at the beach!

1167
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,417
How could you do this to me?

1168
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,477
- Sweetie, come on!
- I don't know who the fuck are you Jordan.

1169
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,289
You're like a completely different fucking person.

1170
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:04,316
I made a mistake, I don't know
what to tell you, babe, I...

1171
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,486
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

1172
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:09,430
Is that what you want?

1173
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:21,339
Do you love her?

1174
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,512
Answer me.

1175
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:51,399
I felt horrible.

1176
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:56,342
3 days later I filed for a divorce
and move Naomi into the apartment.

1177
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,512
Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style.

1178
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,250
She brought in an decorator,
feng shui the whole place,

1179
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,315
she even hired a gay butler.

1180
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:14,262
This guy was smart, sophisticated,
professional, I mean really, really great.

1181
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:18,495
- Jasmine? - Yes, Sir, I try to stump
you this evening, really good.

1182
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,264
Very good, great nose.

1183
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,396
Except for that one time.

1184
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,470
Oh, My God!

1185
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,247
Oh, hey...

1186
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,307
Is it wednesday already?

1187
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:39,287
What the fuck? That is fuck up!

1188
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:42,314
He must thought we still at The
Hamptons this weekend, you know?

1189
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:44,383
- Where are they doing it, sweet heart?
In the bed room? - They were everywhere!

1190
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:47,453
There were 2 guys over there on
the table, there are more over here.

1191
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,330
- There were 4 right here.
- Oh, God! Are you fucking serious?

1192
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,392
Right there? Why didn't you tell me, sweetie?

1193
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,232
Baby, that worst.

1194
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,373
After they're left they checked the apartment.

1195
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:01,433
Right, what? What is it, baby? What?

1196
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:04,241
- Where's my money?
- I don't know where your money...

1197
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,339
zWhere's my fucking money, where is it?

1198
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,284
I don't know where your money is
Mr. Belfort, I didn't do anything.

1199
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,513
- You don't know where my money is? - He's
lying Jordan, he's lying to his fucking teeth.

1200
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:14,285
Let's start from the beginning!
Let's start from the beginning, right?

1201
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,291
- You invited some friends over, right?
- Yes.

1202
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,259
One thing led to another, things got outta hand,

1203
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:23,221
We understand that, we do blow all the time, we
fucking degenerates us, so look at us, right?

1204
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,462
My money were stolen from my
apartment, right from my socks drawer, alright?

1205
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,460
Like I say, I don't know where your money is.

1206
01:03:28,504 --> 01:03:30,369
Just start from the beginning, who came over?

1207
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,498
It's a normal day, I knew
you coming home the next day,

1208
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:34,476
so everything will be fine, it will be cleaned up.

1209
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:38,407
I got a little high at breakfast, I
got a little happy and made some eggs.

1210
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:41,507
had a little bit ice cream, and then I
say, who do I know who likes ice cream.

1211
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:44,281
- My friend Rudy, so I call Rudy.
- Who's Rudy?

1212
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,378
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1213
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,253
You know who Rudy is, come on.

1214
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:52,261
- He know who Rudy is?
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1215
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,286
- I don't know anyone named Rudy.
- You know, last month, The Lollipop club.

1216
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,319
You know who Rudy was.

1217
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:57,357
You know Rudy?

1218
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,393
I don't know about, fucking know anyone...
What do you mean?

1219
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:04,373
- So he went to The Lollipop club?
- Oh, he was at The Lollipop club for sure.

1220
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:06,307
On the stage aquintance with everybody.

1221
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:09,470
I got fucked up, I like the dance, I don't
know... Maybe I met them, maybe i didn't.

1222
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,479
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1223
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:14,440
- $20.000 dollars was stolen from my fucking
sock drawer! - What are you saying?

1224
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,348
All my girlfriends know that!

1225
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,410
I don't know who Rudy is, what the fuck!

1226
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:22,323
You little faggot friend, Rudy,
take my shit, did he? Answer me!

1227
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,418
Okay, now I get it, now I get why I'm...
This is a gay thing.

1228
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,293
- Oh!
- I see all of you.

1229
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,425
This is because you're a fag?

1230
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:34,266
My cousin is a fucking faggot and I go on
vacation with him and his boyfriend! I love faggot

1231
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,270
You're like being charged, right?

1232
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,464
I will not be stolen from, you get that?

1233
01:04:36,472 --> 01:04:38,497
I fucking like gay people, I don't like you!

1234
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:41,472
You should hire a fucking Mexican
like I hired in my fucking house.

1235
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:44,313
Shit!

I'm gonna drop you, you fucking!
Where is it?

1239
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:56,349
Chester and Toby, they
went all yakuza on Nicholas.

1240
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,484
You know, they got crazy.

1241
01:04:58,327 --> 01:04:59,316
I really appreciate your help.

1242
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:02,229
I had to call the copsjust to
keep them from killing the poor guy.

1243
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,459
I gave them each $2.000 bucks and
told them what Nicholas have done.

1244
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,462
They naked his ass.

1245
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,374
It's not like I care about the $50.000 anyway.

1246
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:16,344
I was making that much almost everyday
through one rat hole or another.

1247
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,414
A rat hole, is a friend, like Brad here.

1248
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,282
Who held stock in his name for me.

1249
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,343
How are you doing? Goodbye...

1250
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:29,313
I drive the price up, then he'd sells
and kick most of the profit back to...

1251
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:32,259
you guessed it, me!

1252
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:36,363
All cash, none of it's on the books.

1253
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,401
A big no no of course in the eyes of the law.

1254
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:43,236
Enter our new security attorney, Manny Riskin.

1255
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:47,299
$700 bucks an hour to be the voice of doom.

1256
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,471
You pissed up the SEC's leg, you
end up with your tits in the ringer.

1257
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,379
Do not worry about it, I
have The SEC under control.

1258
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:55,409
What the fuck are these imbeciles doing?

1259
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:58,319
Hey, what are you doing? Hey!

1260
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,254
We got The SEC in here!

1261
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:05,326
The Security of Exchange Comission
sent 2 lawyers down to review our files.

1262
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,352
So I set them up in our conference room.

1263
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:12,424
And I had it bugged and the air conditioning
turn up so high that it felt like antartica there.

1264
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:15,403
- Is it always this cold in here?
- I don't know.

1265
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:18,464
Then, while they were looking
for a smoking gun in that room,

1266
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:25,469
I was gonna fire off a bazooka
here, offering up our latest IPO.

1267
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:28,483
An IPO is an initial public offering,

1268
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:32,351
It's a first time a stock is offered
for sales to the general population.

1269
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:35,516
Now as the firm taking the company
public, we set the initial sales price...

1270
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:38,226
then sold those shares right back to our friends.

1271
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:42,424
Yet... Look, You're not gonna
following what I'm saying anyway, right?

1272
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:44,499
That's okay, that doesn't matter.

1273
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,368
The real question is this, was all this legal?

1274
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,463
Absolutely fucking not.

1275
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,373
We will making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1276
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,508
And what do you do when you making
more money than you knew what to do with?

1277
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,285
Oh, My God.

1278
01:07:08,324 --> 01:07:10,349
Will you marry me?

1279
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,417
Oh, My God.

1280
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,451
Is that a yes?

1281
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:17,390
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1282
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,425
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1283
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:33,414
I held my bchelor party
at The Mirage in Las Vegas.

1284
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:36,249
They flight there alone was a buck and all.

1285
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:40,245
One last blow out fior the God
before I settle down for good.

1286
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:45,249
A hundred staff, 50 hookers plus
50 more waiting once we landed.

1287
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:50,331
All in drugs, I mean I tell you, up
plane was like a pharmacy with wings.

1288
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:24,261
All told, that we came
across nearly 2 million bucks.

1289
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:28,494
Including the cost of
refurbishing the entire 28 floor.

1290
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,430
Kiss the bride.

1291
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:36,501
Ah, but the wedding was
something out of a fairy tale.

1292
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:39,379
With Naomi, my Duchess.

1293
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:44,284
Meet her handsome Duke in the Bahamas ocean club.

1294
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:59,458
Of course after the bachelor party, me,
The Duke needed a few pennicilin shots,

1295
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:03,495
so we could safely consumate the marriage.

1296
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,301
I'm Barry Klineman, filming the wedding.

1297

A few words, huh? For your son.

1298
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:17,453
Jordan, remember what I told you, it
involves your penis and her vagina...

1299
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:21,422
and you know what to do, Jordy.

1300

Oh, My God! Aunt Emma?

1301

- Aunt Emma, hey, how are you doing?
- Jordan, how are you?

- Just one more step.
- Where are we going?

1312

Keep your eyes closed, 1, 2, 3!

1313

- What is this?
- It's your wedding present.

- What?
- It's your wedding present, sweetheart.

- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

A pricy pleasure boat offer the most fun of love.

1320

It's no coincidence that it's 150 feet
of green hull is the color of passion.

01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,407

what you're up to?

1365
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,254
- You're father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1366
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:17,315
You're father now, and yet you still acting
like an infant!

1367
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:22,260
God damn it! Baby, you know, you got really
anger issues!

1368
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:24,357
- You got so many emotional problem..
- Who was the one who threw in here..

1369
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,369
At three in the morning on that stupid helicopter?

1370
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,268
And woke up Skylar.

1371
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:32,434
- That was you.
- Skylar, that fucking bullshit!

1372
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:49,448
Does it matter to you, that I just hit that
driving range, sided with bermuda grass..

1373
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:52,358
- Oh, My God, bermuda Grass.
- You fucking ridiculous!

1374
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:56,491
No, you didn't research the whole thing, and
you with the fucking gold course!

1375
01:13:56,532 --> 01:14:00,366
Oh my God, you had the deal with the golf
course people too!

1376
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:03,304
What a great tragedy, honey, oh My God.

1377
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:07,366
You probably had to pay them in cash,
with you hand, what a fucking burns!

1378
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:11,505
And actually do some work besides swiping
my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1379
01:14:11,547 --> 01:14:14,345
'Cause I can't keep tracking you profession,
honey!

1380
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,340
'Cause last month you're one connoisseur..

1381
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:19,445
And now you aspiring landscape architect,
let me get that right?

1382
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:23,356
- Fuck you!
- No, no fucking dare throw that fucking
water at me!

1383
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:25,360
Don't you fucking dare!

1384
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,428
All right, honey?

1385
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:30,398
And we can just, we can talk this on, all right?

1386
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,264
Just use our words, you know..

1387
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,427
Communicating, okay?

1388
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:39,466
Come one sweetheart, talk to me.

1389
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:43,377
Stop flexing your muscle Jordan, you look
like a fucking imbecile.

1390
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:46,243
Babe, come on, you should feel..

1391
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:50,479
...should feel happy you gotta husband
who's in such a great shape like this, huh?

1392
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:55,517
Come here, come on give me a kiss, you look
so beautiful right now, come on.

1393
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:57,247
- Kiss you?
- You look so beautiful..

1394
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,352
- Kiss you?
- Yeah, give me one..

1395
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:01,455
Fuck you!

1396
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,363
Ah, yes, my morning ritual.

1397
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:08,427
First I'd get up and fight with Naomi about
whatever is I did the night before,

1398
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:12,463
Next was a steam so I could sweat out the
drugs that still in my system..

1399
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:14,374
Then I assess the damage.

1400
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:19,312
Drowned out my eyeball, take my back pill
to get the day started,

1401
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,373
Then seek to make up with Naomi.

1402
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:23,476
Good morning daddy.

1403
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,352
Where's my kiss?

1404
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:29,450
Hey, sweetheart..

1405
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:33,452
Could daddy get a kiss from
both of you little girls?

1406
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:42,369
Oh no, no, daddy doesn't even get to touch
mommy, for a very very very long time

1407
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:46,432
Daddy is really sorry about what he said
in the other room, he didn't mean any of it.

1408
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:49,375
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1409
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:58,285
And from now on, it's gonna be nothing but short,
short skirt around the house.

1410
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:02,321
And you know something else, daddy..

1411
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:10,298
Mommy isjust so sick
and tired wearing panties

1412
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,325
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1413
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:26,269
In fact, she is decided to throw them
all away.

1414
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,478
So take a good look daddy,

1415
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:36,486
You gonna be seeing all of this
around the house.

1416
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:39,417
Yeah, mommy.

1417
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:42,354
But no touching.

1418
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:51,466
- What's wrong daddy?
- oh, baby..

1419
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:54,468
God..

1420
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:57,403
Look at this shit.

1421
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,346
Okay, mommy likes to play game with daddy.

1422
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:04,216
Mommy..

1423
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:10,350
Have you ever notice anything odd about
Mr. Fuzzybear over there?

1424
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:15,260
His eyes seems to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1425
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:19,424
Yeah, there's something little bit different
about his eyes.

1426
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:22,362
Yes, I think it's true,
say hi mommy!

1427
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:25,237
Say Hi to Rocco and Rocco,
say hi.

1428
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:27,241
Are you fellas see that, huh?

1429
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:31,336
Of all the fucking days, she chooses today
to give me blue balls.

1430
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:34,246
I mean today was the biggest day
in Stratton history..

1431
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:36,342
And I needed to be thinking straight.

1432
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,409
Jordan, welcome!

1433
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:39,452
Steve here yet?

1434
01:17:39,454 --> 01:17:43,254
This was the day that we launch the Steve
Madden IPO.

1435
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:45,249
Should be around here,
everyone are rallied, excited..

1436
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:48,285
Everything had to run tight, and had
to be perfect.

1437
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,389
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1438
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,296
What is he doing?

1439
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:57,268
The biggest IPO in the firm's history,
what the fuck is he doing?

1440
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:00,337
Is he.. is he wearing a bowtie?

1441
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,436
Hi, How are you doing?

1442
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:05,343
Good.

1443
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:07,382
Are you cleaning the fish bowl?

1444
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:15,223
- I just, I had a minute and I..
- You gotta minute, and today you need to clean
the wish bowl? today?

1445
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:18,487
I have finished my paperwork, and I was
thought that I just have couple minutes.

1446
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:21,360
Okay, nice to meet you.

1447
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,231
On the issue day!

1448
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:32,340
You cocksucker! Why the fuck in the issue day?!

1449
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,239
This is what you do?!

1450
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:36,471
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1451
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:40,407
This is what happen when you fuck with
your pet on the Issue day!

1452
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:57,391
Take your little bowtie, get your
shit, and get the fuck outta my office.
You understand?

1453
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,390
Get the fuck out!

1454
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:07,465
Everybody on port! We are here
to make money, everybody on port

1455
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,380
The real wolf pit, which
is exactly how I liked it

1456
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:15,315
Jordan, When I came to lobby I caught a genius.

1457
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,318
Enter, Steve Madden.

1458
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:20,455
Red hot ladies footwear impressario.

1459
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:24,289
And thanks to Donnie, we were taking
this company public

1460
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:28,251
Stratton Oakmont was crawling at the
primordial Oz.

1461
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:29,524
Pawn Scam no more.

1462
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:31,396
That's why they gotta see your face.

1463
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:34,300
Get them fired up so they push the
shit outta this stack, okay?

1464
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:39,364
Not only that, Donnie and I secretly own
85%% Steve Madden's shoes.

1465
01:19:39,407 --> 01:19:41,432
Which illegally speaking was a big no, no.

1466
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:45,311
But we get filthy fucking rich
of our troops got behind it.

1467
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,473
Ourjob was to get them worked up.

1468
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:49,512
But not too worked up.

1469
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:57,247
Hello, for those who don't know me, I uhhh,

1470
01:19:57,259 --> 01:20:00,422

1471
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,396
The shoe, show them the shoe,

1472
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:06,265
Okay, yeah, anyway, you know,

1473
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,269
This pretty cool, this is the Mary Lou

1474
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:11,330
Which is really the shoe who put me on the map,
without her, I wouldn't be here.

1475
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:13,398
- It's a fat girl shoe.
- Believe it or not..

1476
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:18,401
Believe it or not, though, Mary Loui is actually
the same as the Mary Jane but it's black Leather.

1477
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:27,378
Got back! Come on, will you, will you!

You're having good afternoon or what?

1482
01:20:43,538 --> 01:20:50,307
I want to take a moment to tell you why Steve
here is so absolutely off the fucking wall.

1483
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:54,438
Is because this man is a creative genius.

1484
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:58,350
This ability, this gift that Steve has..

1485
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,446
.. goes beyond just, spotting the hottest shoe
trends.

1486
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:05,522
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1487
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,324
You understand?

1488
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:13,265
Oddest like Steve come along once every Decade,

Steve come over here for second.

1491
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,434
I don't think you're all realized.

1492
01:21:19,507 --> 01:21:30,247
That Steve Madden is the hottest person in the
winning shoe industry with orders going through
the roof of every departmen store in North America

1493
01:21:30,318 --> 01:21:32,479
We have him here at our office!

1494
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:36,290
We should thank our fucking lucky
star, this man is here.

1495
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:41,422
We should be on our hands in knees right

1496
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:45,488
Like this! Ok? I want to suck
you off, Steve!

1497

Everyone is going to suck you off.

1498
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:53,272
This is our golden ticket into the
fucking chocolate factory right here.

1499
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:57,244
And I want to meet Louis Vodka Wonka,

1500
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:00,476
And I want to meet with the fucking
Oompa Loompa like this!

1501
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,447
All right, get off this fucking stage,
get out of here.

1502
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:10,257
All right, I want you to focus
for a second.

1503
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,283
See those little black boxes?

1504
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:16,263
They call it telephone, I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret about this telephone.

1505
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:19,232
It not gonna dial themselves, okay?

1506
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:23,330
Without you, they just worthless
hungs of plastics.

1507
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:27,501
Like a loaded M-16 without a trained marine
to pull the trigger.

1508
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,370
And in the case of the Telephone,

1509
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:34,348
It's up to each and every one of you..

1510
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:43,517
My hightly trained Strattonites,
my killers who will not take no for an answer.

1511
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:46,289
My fucking warriors.

1512
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,285
Who'll not hang up the phone.

1513
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:55,259
until their client either buys or
fucking die!

1514
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:10,248
Let me tell you something.

1515
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:13,413
There is no nobility in poverty.

1516
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:19,417
I've been a rich man, and I've been a poor man,
and I choose to rich every fucking time!

1517
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:25,265
'Coz at least as a rich man, when I have to face
my problems, I show up in the back of the limo..

1518
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:30,397
Wearing $ 2000 suite, and $ 14000
gold fucking watch.

1519
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,402
Good boys, get him up! Hit him!

1520
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:37,502
Fuck off from me!

1521
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:42,279
If there anyone here thinks I am superficial
of materialistic..

1522
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:47,311
Go get a job in fucking McDonalds, 'cause
that's where you fucking belong!

1523
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:52,417
But before you depart this room
full of winners..

1524
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:56,395
I want you to take a good look at the
person next you, go on.

1525
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:59,460
'Cause sometime in not so distant future..

1526
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:06,430
You know, you pulled out to a red light and
you beat-up old fucking Pinto, and that person
gonna be pulling up right along side you..

1527
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:09,409
In the brand new Porsche.

1528
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:14,474
With their beautiful wife by their side,
who's got big full up juiced tits.

1529
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:17,443
And who will you be next to?

1530
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:25,325
Some disgusting wildebeast with 3 days of razor
stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in the
next you with a carload of groceries from the

1531
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,486
.. fucking price club!

1532
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:29,292
And that's who you're gonna be sitting next to!

1533
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:31,423
So you listen to me and you
listen well.

1534
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:34,266
Are you behind on you credit card bills?

1535
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,496
Good, pick up the
phone and start dialing!

1536
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:39,405
Is the landlord ready to evict you? Good!

1537
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:42,239
Pick up the phone, and start dialling!

1538
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:46,236
Is your girlfriend think you're fucking
worthless loser? Good!

1539
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:48,374
Pick up the phone and
start dialling!

1540
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:52,513
I want you to deal with your problems
by becoming rich!

1541
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:56,217
All you have to do today!

1542
01:24:56,257 --> 01:24:58,384
Is pick up the phone.

1543
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:01,453
And speak the words that I have taught you.

1544
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:08,335
And I will make you richer than the most
powerfull CEO in the United States.

1545
01:25:11,239 --> 01:25:13,298
I want you to go out there..

1546
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:19,344
And I want you to ram Steve Madden's stock down
to your clients throats..

1547
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:22,315
Till they fucking chokes on it.

1548
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:27,380
Till they choke on it and the buy a hundred
thousands shares, that's what I want to do!

1549
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,480

1552
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:41,527
Now let's start this motherfucker
rolling around!

1553
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:44,364
[ MUSIC ]

1554
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:15,358
At one PM, we opened the stock for sale
at 4 dollar and 15 cent a share

1555
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:18,396
By 01:03, it was over $18.

1556
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:21,374
Even the big wallstreet firms were buying.

1557
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:35,446
From the 2 million shares offered for sale, a
million belong to me held in phony accounts by my
ratholes.

1558
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:38,357
Now, once the price hit the high teens..

1559
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:42,327
You know what? Who gives this
shit? As always, the point is this.

1560
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:47,427
$ 22.000.000 in 3 fucking hours!

1561
01:26:47,468 --> 01:26:50,301
Can you believe it?

1562
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:51,362
I get love this-

1563
01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:52,339
Crazy account!

1564
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:56,241
Call for you! Berry Kleinman
on the phone from Future Video?

1565
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:59,371
- Who?
- I don't know, he shoot your wedding,
he said it's urgent.

1566
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:01,405
Urgent? Who the fuck is Berry Kleinman?

1567
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:04,214
Oh my God, you want to marry me?
You're in love with me?

1568
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:05,412
Yeah, go fuck your cousin.

1569
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:06,385
Berry, what's up?

1570
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:10,448
- Listen, uh, I got this Subpoena..
- Subpoena? What are you talking about?

1571
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:12,483
The FBI, they want to copy of your
wedding video.

1572
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:15,394
Fucking FBI? Are you fucking kidding me?

1573
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:19,423
Listen to me, his name is Denham, he is an
agent within the New York Office.

1574
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:21,425
What is his problem? He's a boyscout!

1575
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:24,233
Thinks you're fucking Gordon Gecko!

1576
01:27:24,472 --> 01:27:27,441
What does he want from my wedding video?
It's like invasion to my privacy.

1577
01:27:27,442 --> 01:27:30,343
You know what I am saying? It's like..
It's intrusive!, you know..

1578
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:33,313
He's got picture of your whole inner
fucking circle

1579
01:27:33,348 --> 01:27:36,511
Pictures, name of the people, he is do what
is he wants to do, exactly what is he do.

1580
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:40,317
Look at your self, he's try to rattle you,
he's try to rattle your old lady..

1581
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:43,222
So she nagging you to turns become
a fucking witness.

1582
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,352
Oh, so he wants me to rat on my self, he wants
me to give information about my..

1583
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:50,262
- What your solution?
- The good fucking news, is I know everybody
down town.

1584
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:56,237
I called the justice department, the DEA, nobody
even know you fucking exist. So calm down!

1585
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:58,432
- They don't know I exist?
- No.

1586
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:00,373
That's Good.

1587
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:08,214
- But you.. you know who is he, right?
- Yeah.

1588
01:28:08,249 --> 01:28:14,381
So if I just want to get some more information,
just find out what he know, you can.. you can go
his house, go to his house

1589
01:28:14,455 --> 01:28:17,481
right, tap his phone, a little bit bug him..
you could get some information

1590
01:28:17,525 --> 01:28:20,460
You don't fuck with these guys like this.

1591
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:23,259
You don't fuck with him like that, what do
nuts or something?

1592
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:24,526
What do you fucking do? What did I pay you for?

1593
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:27,296
I have a fucking PI license, you know?

1594
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:29,361
I am making living at this, I am not
a cop anymore.

1595
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:32,271
- They'll take my fucking license away from me,
all right? - Okay.

1596
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:37,404
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just
can I get the guy a call?

1597
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:40,338
- Why? Is that..
- Jordan, Jordan..

1598
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:44,283
Do me a favor, the only one who
call this guy is your lawyer.

1599
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,411
- Allright, okay..
- What would you do?

1600
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:51,518
I told you, whatever the fuck you say to him, he's
gonna use against you, don't you understand?!

1601
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:53,517
He is smart, you dumb

1602
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:58,289
- I am not allowing call-
- Are we fucking talking tonite or you gonna

1603
01:28:58,299 --> 01:29:02,463
The last time you took this fucking pills, you
put your head and fucking like a maniac, now
pick it up!

1604
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:04,368
All right.

1605
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:06,306
Okay, I won't call him.

1606
01:29:08,543 --> 01:29:13,276
Hey fellas, come on board, plank's
around there.

1607
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:15,313
Welcome.

1608
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:17,375
Huh, what a nice day.

1609
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:22,448
Hey, welcome aboard

1610
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:25,391
Jordan, welcome to the Naomi,
nice to meet you.

1611
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:28,328
- Agent Denham, this is agent Hughes.
- Hi, how are you?

1612
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:29,296
Now, I'll introduce you..

1613
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:31,457
This Nicole, Heidi, come on,
don't be shy..

1614
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:34,264
Why do you guys shy for?
Don't be scared..

1615
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:35,360
These are friends of Stratton.

1616
01:29:35,403 --> 01:29:37,462
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

1617
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,367
- Come on..
- Your message said that..

1618
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:43,343
You want to speak privately.

1619
01:29:43,344 --> 01:29:45,244
Right, I do want to speak privately.

1620
01:29:45,246 --> 01:29:46,338
Give us some minute, hey ladies?

1621
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:49,373
- Let me know if I can get you anything.
- We'd be happy to help.

1622
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:56,314
You guys hungry? Want some to eat? We got some
pasta, shrimp, lobster. I got whiskey and kind
of Booze..

1623
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:59,451
You know what, the biro doesn't allow us
to drink while at sea.

1624
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,519
Duh, I forgot, of course.

1625
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,497
Ever been on one of these before?

1626
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:05,391
A boat?

1627
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,360
Learned to sail when I was six

1628
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:09,427
No shit? Is that right? All right.

1629
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:11,404
I mean, one like this.

1630
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:14,374
The whole front extended so it fit
the chopter up there.

1631
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,309
You see that?

1632
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,303
Any way, this is for you.

1633
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:21,509
It's uh, a complete list of every person
who was at my wedding..

1634
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:27,284
Yeah, I understand you want the whole wedding
video, figured this would help the whole process,
right?

1635
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:29,222
- There you go.
- Look..

1636
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:32,226
My point is that I know you're investigating
Stratton..

1637
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:35,491
But for the life of me,
I can't figure it out why

1638
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:41,366
I know we are little unorthodox, we are little
loud in the way we do things, we gotta understand
with the new guys on the block..

1639
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:44,235
You know, trying to make an impression, but..

1640
01:30:44,338 --> 01:30:47,239
Now I want you to understand, we don't..

1641
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:50,438
do anything Illegal, whatsoever.

1642
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:55,313
You could talk to the SEC, there were at my
office 15 times for the last 6 month..

1643
01:30:55,349 --> 01:30:58,216
I mean I got nothing to hide.

1644
01:30:58,252 --> 01:31:02,416
Well, you know the SEC is civil right regulatory
agency, we pursue criminal activity.

1645
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:06,257
Exactly, you go after real criminals..

1646
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:10,458
Makes me wonder what.. what the hell are you
doing sticking me for?

1647
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:14,333
What is the thing that we did? or do?
I don't get it.

1648
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:18,361
Well, I.. Jordan I can't discuss
ongoing investigations.

1649
01:31:18,372 --> 01:31:20,306
No, I get that, No I understand.

1650
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:24,335
With that said, this case got dumped on
my desk.

1651
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:26,370
- Did it?
- You know, by higher up who..

1652
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:29,383
needs to make a show looking in and the
new company on the block..

1653
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:31,317
- Loud guy..
- I got pressing and anything..

1654
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,413
And then I ended up be in the
smuch who does the local, exactly.

1655
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:37,424
Itjust, you know, bothers me..
We are the new guy..

1656
01:31:37,425 --> 01:31:39,393
Where the one with bank there
in Wallstreet?

1657
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:44,330
Oh man, you should see what's going on the
bigger firms, I mean I know all the information.

1658
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:49,302
It's true, Goldman, Lehmann Brothers, Merryl,
collateralized debt obligation..

1659
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,431
Internet stock bullshit? I mean, it's a fucking
travesty.

1660
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:57,468
I mean I can take you step by step, to what
exactly is occuring, you know..

1661
01:31:57,478 --> 01:32:00,470
All you have to do is ask.

1662
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,346
It's exactly what I want to hear.

1663
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:07,481
- Hmm.
- I don't see why a little sitdown like this, can
be profitable for the both.

1664
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:11,253
- It should, right, it should profitable.
- It should.

1665
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:17,391
Look, I am gonna give my personal line, 5
days a week, you just call me, feel free.

1666
01:32:17,465 --> 01:32:20,434
- I'll do that.
- Great.

1667
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:27,238
Are you sure you guys don't want some to
drink? I mean, you're not hungry? Nothing?

1668
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:28,297
- Nothing?
- Oh no.

1669
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:30,368
No.

1670
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:36,512
Mind if I ask you, and if you dont want to get
too personal, just tell me to shut up at anytime.

1671
01:32:37,485 --> 01:32:40,352
Did you try to get your broker's license
at one time?

1672
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:43,516
Isn't that right? When you trying to take
a step at wallstreet?

1673
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:45,520
- No?
- Who have been told it to you?

1674
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,251
- Who the fuck you've been talking to?
- Why you investigating me..

1675
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:51,322
Hei, you see what I mean?

1676
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:56,326
You ever think about what would happen
if you're, you know, stay in the course.

1677
01:32:57,438 --> 01:33:02,466
You know what? When I ridin' home on the subway,
and my balls are fucking sweating, I'm wearing the
same suit 3 days in a row,

1678
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:06,344
Yeah, you bet I do, I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't rite?

1679
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:07,347
Yeah, who fucking wouldn't?

1680
01:33:07,348 --> 01:33:10,283
I mean, what do you.. another personal question,
no need to answer if you don't like..

1681
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:11,342
No, that's all right, Jordan.

1682
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:14,378
Whattaya pull in? 50? 60'k?
something like that?

1683
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:16,413
A year? Low part?

1684
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:20,226
Let's put it this way.

1685
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:23,286
You get a free hand gun when you
sign up for the biro.

1686
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,399
No, but it is fucking pisses me off, you know.

1687
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:29,426
When you think about the people that build
this country, hardworking people like you..

1688
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:32,303
You know, fire fighters, teachers,
FBI agent..

1689
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:37,471
End of the day you guys get fucking skin-the-life
financially, fucking makes me angry.

1690
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:41,447
That's the one thing about Wall street, in this
market is, for me..

1691
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:46,284
I feel it's good to give back, you know,

1692
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,379
There's situation where I can..

1693
01:33:48,422 --> 01:33:52,222
make those situations better for people.

1694
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:53,418
You know what I mean.

1695
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:56,362
Opportunity is everything.

1696
01:33:56,397 --> 01:33:58,228
Exactly.

1697
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:00,460
Take for example I got this one
kid, right?

1698
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:04,337
He went to school for environmental
science something like that..

1699
01:34:04,372 --> 01:34:09,309
He was bogged down by students loan,
turns out, his mother needed triple bypass surgery

1700
01:34:09,343 --> 01:34:11,311
- Right, horrible situation.
- Sure.

1701
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:16,373
We got them minute, the market, the right time,
choose the right stock, we gave him the right
guidance..

1702
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:19,251
Bom, overnight, change his entire life..

1703
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:22,414
You know, He gotta put his mother into
the best hospital in New York City.

1704
01:34:23,324 --> 01:34:26,418
It didn't work out for her, she passed
away unfortunately, but..

1705
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:29,419
We gave him that opportunity,
you know what I am saying?

1706
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:34,490
Itjust about sending up the right team and
then overnight your life can change.

1707
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:46,275
What if.. what is.. what is the intern to make
a deal like that?

1708
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,508
Oh that's the situation.

1709
01:34:47,548 --> 01:34:51,484
I mean, that particular trade,
and one trade.

1710
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,288
North of half a million dollar.

1711
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:03,387
And I do that for anybody, you know, anybody
that needs the proper guidance.

1712
01:35:23,284 --> 01:35:27,414
Can you say that again? Just the
way you said it.

1713
01:35:27,455 --> 01:35:29,423
Just the same way.

1714
01:35:33,427 --> 01:35:35,224
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No..

1715
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:36,422
- Oh come on, you know what I am talking about.
- No, I don't know..

1716
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,228
Say this, I think Jordan just did..

1717
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:40,324
- If I am not mistake
- No.

1718
01:35:40,334 --> 01:35:43,428
- You just tried to bribe a federal agent.
- Oh, technically I didn't.

1719
01:35:43,471 --> 01:35:46,372
I didn't bribe anybody, technically, I didn't.

1720
01:35:46,373 --> 01:35:52,312
No, according to US criminal code, there needs to
be exact dollar to give for the exchange services.

1721
01:35:52,346 --> 01:35:55,406
that would not hold up on the court of law..

1722
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:57,475
No, no, no, that's the truth, but..

1723
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:59,350
- I want to tell you this.
- Yeah.

1724
01:35:59,386 --> 01:36:05,325
The same gentlemen that told me that you try to
get your brokers license also told me that you're
straight arrow.

1725
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:08,295
- You ran a security check on me?
- Well..

1726
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:13,427
Sail on the boat, fit for Bond villain,
sometimes you need to play the part, right?

1727
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:18,235
I think it's time you both get the fuck
off my boat, what do you say?

1728
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:20,297
You know Jordan, I'll tell you something.

1729
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:23,435
- Most of the wallstreetjackasses that I bust..
- Yeah.

1730
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:26,310
They're.. they were the man for born.

1731
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:27,405
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

1732
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:31,441
Their father is douchebag, just like the
fathers before them

1733
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:33,447
But you..

1734
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:38,481
- You got this all way on your own.
- Did I?

1735
01:36:38,492 --> 01:36:41,325
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

1736
01:36:41,362 --> 01:36:43,421
- Good for you.
- Me, the little man?

1737
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:45,330
Let me tell you something.

1738
01:36:45,332 --> 01:36:47,300
No, let me tell you something else.

1739
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:51,236
Honestly, I am not bullshit here, this is one of
the nicest boat I've ever been on,

1740
01:36:51,238 --> 01:36:52,364
- I got tell you this.
- I bet it is.

1741
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:54,341
And you know what I just thinking too?

1742
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:57,310
what a fucking hero that I am gonna
back at the office..

1743
01:36:57,378 --> 01:37:03,317
When the bureau seizes this fucking boat,
because I am being fucked this, fuck, fuck..

1744
01:37:03,384 --> 01:37:06,512
It's beautiful, and you got the beautiful
girls there.

1745
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:10,286
- It's wonderful.
- Okay, get the fuck off my boat.

1746
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:12,382
I am sure we'll be seeing each other
real soon.

1747
01:37:12,393 --> 01:37:16,420
I am sure, good luck on that subway ride home,
and your miserable ugly fucking wife

1748
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,490
I am gonna have Heidi lick some caviar off
my balls in the mean time..

1749
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,401
Hey, you guys want to take some lobsters
for your ride home.

1750
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:27,373
Fucking miserable bricks, I know you can't
afford 'em, fucking cheap fuck.

1751
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:29,467
Fuck those people.

1752
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:33,310
Hey fellas, look what I found in my pocket!

1753
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:35,281
Your salary, right here!

1754
01:37:35,282 --> 01:37:38,217
You know what I call 'em?
Fun coupon.

1755
01:37:38,252 --> 01:37:39,344
See that?

1756
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:41,446
The fun coupon.

1757
01:37:49,363 --> 01:37:52,298
What's hon? What the fuck is in switzerland?

1758
01:37:52,333 --> 01:37:54,324
Swiss fucking bank, that's what.

1759
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:57,361
He was ask couple of time.
I had to hide my money.

1760
01:37:58,372 --> 01:37:59,498
Enter Rugrat.

1761
01:37:59,506 --> 01:38:02,339
He knew this Swiss Banker from law school.

1762
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:07,473
But he was in Geneva, and there's no way I was
gonna make that flight sober.

1763
01:38:08,315 --> 01:38:10,283
So I knew if I took my drugs right

1764
01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:12,376
I could sleep to the entire flight.

1765
01:38:12,419 --> 01:38:15,354
But I had to take them just right.

1766
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:22,421
At 4 PM I pooped a few more ludes,
which is start kicking in by the time I
finished my sales meeting. My dingle face.

1767
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:27,389
By dinner, I popped a few more, on top
of some coctail and valium too.

1768
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:29,493
My slur phase

1769
01:38:31,272 --> 01:38:33,433
By eight thirty, I took a few more ludes..

1770
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:36,307
I am pretty much lost all my motor skill.

1771
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:38,502
This was the drool face.

1772
01:38:41,282 --> 01:38:44,445
And by ten, I didn't know who or what
the fuck I was.

1773
01:38:44,451 --> 01:38:46,510
The Amnesia phase.

1774
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:49,313
And boarded to the plane just before
midnight.

1775
01:38:49,356 --> 01:38:52,348
- Ah look at you, you're so beautiful.
- Excuse me..

1776
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:55,353
It's his sleeping pills, he's all right,
he's all right.

1777
01:38:55,362 --> 01:38:58,422
- May I ask your boarding pass, sir?
- We have the boarding pass.

1778
01:38:58,532 --> 01:39:01,365
Jesus Christ, I am so sleepy.

1779
01:39:01,368 --> 01:39:03,359
Hey, relax!

1780
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:06,237
Oh my God, you got your hand
on my fucking cock!

1781
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:09,299
Get in chair, this guy is touching
my dick again.

1782
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:11,369
- You got his hand on his dick?
- You gotta stop doing that..

1783
01:39:11,412 --> 01:39:13,277
...in public space.

1784
01:39:13,314 --> 01:39:14,440
Take it off.

1785
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:15,506
Take it off.

1786
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:18,416
I heard there's treasure map under this..

1787
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,284
- Excuse me sir.
- I know miss.

1788
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:22,482
Please sit down..

1789
01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:24,320
- Watch him.
- Go back to your seat please.

1790
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:26,485
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

1791
01:39:27,227 --> 01:39:28,353
I had been have to call the taxing.

1792
01:39:28,395 --> 01:39:31,330
Please sir, please, sit down.

1793
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:34,232
- Please,Sit down!
- Okay, okay, I am going!

1794
01:39:34,268 --> 01:39:36,463
- Stop!
- We apologize, we are going to sleep ma'am.

1795
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:37,494
We're sleeping as you question.

1796
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:39,335
Fasten your seatbelt, sir.

1797
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:42,309
- okay.
- We cannot take off if you haven't
fasten your seatbelt.

1798
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:45,312
Sit down, fasten it, I can do it for you.

1799
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:46,279
- What?
- I will do it for you.

1800
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:47,440
- Okay.
- You gotta speak english..

1801
01:39:47,514 --> 01:39:49,414
We don't understand this languages, mam..

1802
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:51,247
I will help him fasten his seatbelt..

1803
01:39:51,251 --> 01:39:52,479
I am not a fucking idiot.

1804
01:39:52,519 --> 01:39:54,453
Sit back, sit back!

1805
01:39:54,455 --> 01:39:57,288
There you go, yeah there you go!

1806
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:04,328
- Hilfa!
- Hilfa!

1807
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:18,501
Jesus christ, fuck.

1808
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:25,375
Donnie, this isn't funny, you
must untie me, buddy.

1809
01:40:25,386 --> 01:40:27,377
I can't untie you.

1810
01:40:27,388 --> 01:40:30,380
The captain tied you up, he almost
fucking teasing you.

1811
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:34,260
- Why?
- Why?

1812
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:49,365
You were screaming at the people.

1813
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:54,247
You are on the floor, like rolling
around and shit.

1814
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:58,308
- You called the captain the ''N'' word.
- I called the captain the ''N'' word?

1815
01:40:58,352 --> 01:41:00,479
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

1816
01:41:00,487 --> 01:41:03,388
- Luckyly we're in the first class.
- Oh jesus.

1817
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:07,358
Jesus christ, I think you have a fucking
drug problem!

1818
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:13,331
- Where the ludes?
- There're at my ass, don't worry about it.

1819
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:14,459
I got it.

1820
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:16,436
Thank god.

1821
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:20,372
Jesus Christ, what we gonna do when we
get to Switzerland buddy? This is bad.

1822
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:24,343
I think this belt are get on my chest,
I can't breathe, come on do something to calm me
down, please?

1823
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:26,369
Okay, Shut the fuck off, shut the fuck off.

1824
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:28,507
- Oh please?
- Okay, sshh

1825
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:31,441
That's good.
Go to sleep.

1826
01:41:31,485 --> 01:41:34,318
- Harder buddy.
- You're all right.

1827
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:36,515
We're all love you..
Shut the fuck off!

1828
01:41:42,362 --> 01:41:46,321
Mr. Belfort, you're free go.

1829
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:50,302
Really?

1830
01:41:52,506 --> 01:41:53,473
- Hi, Donnie.
- Yeah?

1831
01:41:53,474 --> 01:41:57,501
When we get up there, try not to act like
yourself, okay, let's make you even ass hole
version Donnie, all right?

1832
01:41:57,544 --> 01:41:59,478
- Why phone and call me to come for?
- Hey listen.

1833
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:02,347
The only reason you sitting in this limo and not
a Swiss dale 'cause you're my friend,

1834
01:42:02,349 --> 01:42:04,283
- Ok?
- Hilfa!

1835
01:42:04,485 --> 01:42:07,454
- We're here, here, we're here.
- I am more calm down, come on.

1836
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:10,389
Jordan Belfort, at last..

1837
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:13,325
Nicholas has told me so much about you.

1838
01:42:13,327 --> 01:42:16,421
- Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.
- Pleasure to make your acquiantes.

1839
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:18,328
Nice to meet you.

1840
01:42:19,466 --> 01:42:21,229
You understand what we're talking?

1841
01:42:21,268 --> 01:42:22,462
Oh, ok.

1842
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:25,404
- Couch, for desk.
- I don't understand, I am sorry.

1843
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:29,273
I am curious about your
bank secrecy laws here.

1844
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:33,439
Wait, yes, excuse me Jordan.

1845
01:42:34,281 --> 01:42:38,513
- Swiss custom, we require 10 minutes of bla bla.
- Chit chat.

1846
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:41,488
Chit chat thank you, before business
can be discussed.

1847
01:42:43,257 --> 01:42:44,417
Yeah.

1848
01:42:46,493 --> 01:42:50,259
Of course, let's get down to it.

1849
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:52,265
What would you like to know?

1850
01:42:52,266 --> 01:42:57,397
Under what circumstances would you be obligated
to cooperate with the FBI or..

1851
01:42:57,437 --> 01:43:01,339
US justice department investigations,
for example?

1852
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:03,241
Ca depend.

1853
01:43:03,277 --> 01:43:05,404
- Ca depend?
- Yeah.

1854
01:43:06,346 --> 01:43:09,372
Ca depend on what exactly?

1855
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:13,476
Whether America plans to invade
Switzerland in upcoming month.

1856
01:43:14,254 --> 01:43:17,348
- So you want check the tank are rolling down
the Ru de La Croix? - Yes, Ru de La Croix

1857
01:43:17,391 --> 01:43:18,483
- Ah, Croix!
- Yeah, Croix

1858
01:43:18,525 --> 01:43:21,460
Not Croix, not even Ru de La Croix, Croix

1859
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:25,227
This is what we used to do back in law school,
Champagne - Champagna.

1860
01:43:25,265 --> 01:43:28,530
- Yeah.
- yeah yeah, french fries or Frittes.

1861
01:43:29,236 --> 01:43:30,294
And kind uh..

1862
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:32,464
- That kind of stuff.
- That's right.

1863
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:35,401
What I'm asking you, Swiss dick,

1864
01:43:35,442 --> 01:43:38,377
is are you going to fuck me over?

1865
01:43:40,447 --> 01:43:44,508
I understand perfectly,
you American shit.

1866
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:51,289
The only way the Banque Real de
Geneve would cooperate with a
foreign legal body

1867
01:43:51,325 --> 01:43:55,386
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

1868
01:43:55,395 --> 01:44:00,458
But there are very few Swiss laws
which applied to your ''practises''

1869
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:02,468
from a financial standpoint.

1870
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:06,235
You are now in heaven.

1871
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:08,366
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

1872
01:44:08,475 --> 01:44:12,275
If the US Justice Department
sent us as subpoena,

1873
01:44:12,279 --> 01:44:15,373
it will become a,
um.. papier-toillette.

1874
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:19,285
- We will wipe our ass with it.
- [LAUGHING]

1875
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:23,222
Unless, of course, it was an
investigation into stock fraud

1876
01:44:23,257 --> 01:44:26,249
which is a crime here in
Switzerland, if I'm correct.

1877
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:31,288
Then there would have to be co-operation,
on your part, if I'm not mistaken.

1878
01:44:31,331 --> 01:44:34,266
Yes. Yes, we would

1879
01:44:34,501 --> 01:44:37,493
Assuming the account is under your name.

1880
01:44:38,472 --> 01:44:42,340
If it were another name

1881
01:44:42,442 --> 01:44:45,411
- of friends, I get my..
- Cousin.

1882
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:47,436
Cousin, absolutely no.

1883
01:44:50,384 --> 01:44:52,443
- Relative.
- Yeah.

1884
01:44:54,388 --> 01:44:57,255
Was that yodeling I just heard or..

1885
01:44:57,257 --> 01:44:59,418
Did you just say what
I thought he said?

1886
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:02,292
Yes. Yes.

1887
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:04,491
He's telling me to use a fucking
rathole.

1888
01:45:04,498 --> 01:45:08,491
But the US rathole would never get
into Switzerland with all that money.

1889
01:45:08,535 --> 01:45:13,370
What I needed was a rathole with a
European passport.

1890
01:45:13,407 --> 01:45:16,308
[MUSIC]

1891
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:22,442
- Jordan.
- Hey.

1892
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:26,283
- How's my favourite aunt?
- Welcome, was the traffic terrible?

1893
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,345
Oh, no, not at all.

Jordan, Come on in

1895
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:35,251
Thank God, aunt Emma didn't
need too much convincing.

1896
01:45:35,295 --> 01:45:37,456
Turned out the British weren't
too different from the Swiss.

1897
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:40,466
Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.

1898
01:45:40,467 --> 01:45:43,231
How do you say ''rathole'' in British?

1899
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:45,431
.. If you gettin' any trouble whatsoever,

1900
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:48,340
I'll come for it immediately,
I'll say that I duped you.

1901
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:50,343
And I promise.

1902
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:53,312
Risk is what keeps us
young, isn't it darling?

1903
01:45:57,317 --> 01:45:59,376
Sometimes I wonder,

1904
01:45:59,419 --> 01:46:02,411
if you let money get
the best of you, my love,

1905

It's chilly darling,
you're sweating bullets.

01:46:17,404 --> 01:46:19,395
What can I say, I'm um..

1910
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:22,274
I'm a drug addict.

whatever it is, I'll fuckin' do it.

01:46:29,516 --> 01:46:31,347
That's the truth.

1915
01:46:31,385 --> 01:46:34,479
I am.. I am sex addict too.

1916
01:46:35,288 --> 01:46:38,382
Well there are worse things to be
addicted to than sex. [LAUGHING]

1917
01:46:38,525 --> 01:46:42,359
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?
I am sorry.

1918
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:46,331
Because I'm very easy to talk to

You are. You are easy to talk to.

That's about it, it's..

It'sjust my job, you know, it's uh..

1922
01:46:54,307 --> 01:46:59,210
All these people depending on me, tens of
millions of dollars at stake, you know, it's..

1923
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:04,274
Sometimes I feel like I've bitten
off more than I can chew, you know?

You're a man with large appetites.

It is hard, though..

Hard to learn to control the
anxiety, sometimes, you know?

1932
01:47:28,341 --> 01:47:30,275
You know, to..

To release the tension.

all just need to learn.

Learn to do what comes
naturally in life, you know?

So I thought to myself, who
else has European passport?

1951
01:48:39,513 --> 01:48:42,277
Okay Brad, you're making
this too fuckin' tight.

1952
01:48:42,315 --> 01:48:44,510
Now, Brad, as a successful drug dealer,

1953
01:48:45,252 --> 01:48:47,345
spent his winters in the south of France,

1954
01:48:47,387 --> 01:48:49,378
which is where he met his wife, Chantelle.

1955
01:48:49,389 --> 01:48:52,358
A striper of Slovenian origin,

1956
01:48:52,392 --> 01:48:56,226
born in, of all places, Switzerland.

1957
01:49:00,333 --> 01:49:02,324
Well, this is fucked.

1958
01:49:02,335 --> 01:49:04,303
Oh, no, shit!

1959
01:49:07,507 --> 01:49:11,443
- Like this will take a, like, 50 trips.
- I know.

1960
01:49:15,315 --> 01:49:16,373
Yeah, a suicide work.

1961
01:49:16,449 --> 01:49:19,316
But, how about her family? Right?

1962
01:49:19,352 --> 01:49:21,479
I mean, they all got
Swiss's passport, right?

1963
01:49:21,488 --> 01:49:23,422
I mean, she's got parents,
she's got a brother.

1964
01:49:23,456 --> 01:49:26,220
Right, brother's got a wife,
that's five fuckin' people.

1965
01:49:26,259 --> 01:49:28,227
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

1966
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:30,456
They're all fuckin' Swiss and it was like,
''what are you doing?'', they could do that.

1967
01:49:30,497 --> 01:49:33,330
At least I have a family,
you crooked nose fuck!

1968
01:49:33,366 --> 01:49:36,426
Hey, hey, uh, don't
forget about my money.

1969
01:49:38,271 --> 01:49:40,296
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- Hey, I forgot to tell you

1970
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:43,299
- he's got some, he's got some money.
- My money.

1971
01:49:43,343 --> 01:49:45,402
- Yeah, a couple mill comin' in like a week.
- Yeah.

1972
01:49:45,445 --> 01:49:47,504
And when it gets here, I'll give
you a call, you come pick it up.

1973
01:49:50,517 --> 01:49:52,314
You give me a call?

1974
01:49:53,486 --> 01:49:57,286
When it gets here, I'll give you
a call, and you come pick it up.

1975
01:49:57,324 --> 01:49:59,224
Well, we don't fuckin'
work for you, man!

1976
01:49:59,259 --> 01:49:59,520
Shh..

1977
01:49:59,526 --> 01:50:02,393
Sweetheart, you have my
money taped to your tits.

1978
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:04,397
Okay? Technically you do work for me.

1979
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,231
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

1980
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:11,464
If I fuckin' do this, I'm telling
you right now, I ain't goin' to him.

1981
01:50:11,504 --> 01:50:14,405
Okay? I'm not a fuckin' schwas, I
don't do fuckin' pick-ups, alright?

1982
01:50:14,441 --> 01:50:16,306
- But listen to me, when this thing placed,
- I'm gonna take care of everything.

1983
01:50:16,343 --> 01:50:18,368
and I fuckin' say, and you
tell that fuckin' piece of shit.

1984
01:50:18,411 --> 01:50:19,469
- If he comes correct.
- I will.

1985
01:50:19,512 --> 01:50:24,279
If he comes in, I'll fuckin' loopy and fucked up.
I swear to God, I'm a mash that douchebag's teeth.

1986
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:26,285
I hear that, who's fucking cheating?

1987
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:28,219
- Who's fuckin' cheating?!
- Look, may I asking..

1988
01:50:28,254 --> 01:50:30,381
I put the money on that
fuckin' table, not you!

1989
01:50:30,423 --> 01:50:32,357
I'm the reason we
have this fuckin' deal!

1990
01:50:32,359 --> 01:50:34,293
- I have a gun, you fucking idiot!
- What the fuck this gun.

1991
01:50:34,327 --> 01:50:35,385
I already told you this.

1992
01:50:35,428 --> 01:50:39,330
You know what? You're a fuckin' pill
deal, I got five more just like you, bro!

1993
01:50:39,366 --> 01:50:41,266
Keep talking, you piece of shit!

01:50:41,267 --> 01:50:43,360
Do you know what? You dress like shit!

1997
01:50:48,274 --> 01:50:49,332

1998
01:50:49,376 --> 01:50:50,343
Hey pal!

1999
01:50:52,445 --> 01:50:55,380
The next day, aunt Emma flew to Geneve.

2000
01:50:55,415 --> 01:50:58,248
Two million in cash in her carry on.

2001
01:50:58,284 --> 01:51:01,253
Which in a big picture was
a drop in the Swiss bucket.

2002
01:51:02,288 --> 01:51:05,348
'Cause the following month,
over the course of six roundtrips,

2003
01:51:05,392 --> 01:51:10,420
Chantelle's family and friends smugglin'
over 20 millon in cash without even a hiccup.

One fuckin' day, one fuckin' day

2018
01:52:05,318 --> 01:52:07,343
I was fucked up, Brad.

People who don't sucker punch
people when they're scared, okay?

2029
01:52:36,249 --> 01:52:37,273
- I'm scared?

2030
01:52:37,317 --> 01:52:39,410
- I haven't got an apology for that.
- One apology, okay.

2031

01:54:59,259 --> 01:55:00,487
You fuckin' kiddin' me? Lemons?

2095
01:55:00,526 --> 01:55:03,495
- [LAUGHING]
- They're gonna knock us out off our fuckin' head.

2096
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:08,489
When it comes to quaalude, the
lemon 714 was the holygrail.

2097
01:55:08,501 --> 01:55:10,298
- Can you believe it?
- Oh my God..

2098
01:55:10,336 --> 01:55:11,303
I thought they were like a myth.

2099
01:55:11,337 --> 01:55:14,238
Three times as powerful as
anything available today.

2100
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:17,437
- Look at these babies.
- Boy Donnie really knew how to celebrate.

2101
01:55:17,477 --> 01:55:22,346
He said he was saving these for a special
occasion, like a birthday, or being clapfree.

2102
01:55:22,382 --> 01:55:24,350
Or, my money arriving
safely in Switzerland.

2103
01:55:24,384 --> 01:55:25,476
We're gonna die!

2104

[PUKE]

2105
01:55:28,521 --> 01:55:31,285
So that night, I cleared my schedule,

2106
01:55:31,291 --> 01:55:35,318
and I rid my body of anything
that could fuck with my high.

2107
01:55:35,361 --> 01:55:37,420
It was celebration time.

2108
01:55:37,463 --> 01:55:39,226
Okay.

2109
01:55:39,265 --> 01:55:40,391
We start off with one, see how it'll go?

2110
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,368
My guy says all we need is one.

2111
01:55:42,368 --> 01:55:43,300
Here we go.

2112
01:55:44,437 --> 01:55:46,302
- Salute.
- Cheers.

2113
01:55:46,339 --> 01:55:49,274
Maybe if I pull it
again, it will go down.

2114
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:53,206
Steve,Steve! I gotta get outta here.

2115
01:55:53,246 --> 01:55:55,305
No! I think I got it figured out.

2116
01:55:55,348 --> 01:55:59,284
It must be one pull for
up, and two pull for down.

2117
01:55:59,319 --> 01:56:00,343
Okay.

2118
01:56:08,494 --> 01:56:10,291
You feel anything?

2119
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:15,231
No.

2120
01:56:17,303 --> 01:56:19,237
Been thirty five minutes.

2121
01:56:21,441 --> 01:56:25,241
Maybe we built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?

2122
01:56:26,546 --> 01:56:28,309
Hm..

2123
01:56:38,324 --> 01:56:39,382
This is bullshit!

2124
01:56:39,425 --> 01:56:42,485
My metabolism is pumped
out, I can't feel shit!

2125
01:56:42,528 --> 01:56:45,361
They're old, I think
they lost the potency?

2126
01:56:45,365 --> 01:56:46,332
Huh?

2127
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:47,423
Check the bottle!

2128
01:56:51,237 --> 01:56:52,363
January '81

2129
01:56:52,405 --> 01:56:53,429
They're fuckin' duds.

2130
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:55,464
- Fuck!
- Let's take a..

2131
01:56:55,508 --> 01:56:57,476
- Take two more each.
- Yeah.

2132
01:56:59,379 --> 01:57:01,279
Jordan!

2133
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:02,338
You're up, babe?

2134
01:57:05,418 --> 01:57:07,283
What are you two retards doing?

2135
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:08,378
We're workin' out, honey.

2136
01:57:09,322 --> 01:57:11,222
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2137
01:57:11,257 --> 01:57:13,384
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

2138
01:57:15,328 --> 01:57:16,317
Hey! Bo, what's going on?

2139
01:57:16,362 --> 01:57:18,227
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2140
01:57:18,264 --> 01:57:20,391
I can not talk to you in this
phone, and I have to talk with you.

2141
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,231
We're gonna get outta
here. What's going on?

2142
01:57:22,268 --> 01:57:25,396
Listen to me, leave the
fuckin' house, Jordan!

2143
01:57:25,438 --> 01:57:29,306
And then call me from a payphone.
This is not a fuckin' joke, Jordan.

2144
01:57:29,342 --> 01:57:30,434
Yeah, yeah. Ya.

2145
01:57:31,444 --> 01:57:33,309
- Shit!
- What's.. What he said?

2146
01:57:33,346 --> 01:57:35,246
I don't know what the fuck
is going on, I gotta go!

2147
01:57:35,281 --> 01:57:36,339
Is everything okay, Jordan?

2148
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:51,395
The closest payphone I can get to
is at the Brookvile Contry Club.

2149
01:57:51,431 --> 01:57:53,399
It was a real WASP stronghold.

2150
01:57:53,433 --> 01:57:56,231
Just a mile down the road from my house.

2151
01:58:06,245 --> 01:58:08,372
Hey Bo, what's up? It's me, what's going
on? I'm at the payphone, what's going on?

2152
01:58:08,381 --> 01:58:09,348
Listen to me carefully.

2153
01:58:09,415 --> 01:58:12,316
Please, your little friend
here, Brad, your little buddy,

2154
01:58:12,318 --> 01:58:13,376
he's in jail.

2155
01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:15,478
He.. What the fuck he's in
jail for? What did he do?

2156
01:58:15,488 --> 01:58:16,477
I don't know what he did.

2157
01:58:16,522 --> 01:58:20,424
My friend in Long Island told me he got
picked up in some fuckin' shopping mall,

2158
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:23,486
- he got locked up..
- Wait, did you say a shopping mall?

2159
01:58:24,230 --> 01:58:25,322
- Yeah, yeah.
- He, he was with Donnie

2160
01:58:25,364 --> 01:58:28,333
he was supposed to deliver some money,
and that fuckin' fat piece of shit.

2161
01:58:28,367 --> 01:58:30,267
- I'm gonna go and fuckin' kill him.
- Jordan, Jordan, Jordan. Listen to me!

2162
01:58:30,269 --> 01:58:31,395
Don't go! Listen to me.

2163
01:58:31,437 --> 01:58:34,304
That guy, Denham, that FBI agent guy,

2164
01:58:34,307 --> 01:58:38,266
somebody told me, he's got your phone
tapped. Your ofice and your home.

2165
01:58:38,311 --> 01:58:41,371
- Don't talk on that motherfuckin' phone!
- Okay. Fuck! I got it, I got it.

2166
01:58:41,447 --> 01:58:42,414
I got it, I got it.

Jordan.

2168
01:58:44,317 --> 01:58:47,480
You didn't try to bribe this
fuckin' FBI agent, did you?

2169
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:50,284
No, I didn't try to
bribe that FBI agent.

2170
01:58:50,289 --> 01:58:51,415
You think I'm that fuckin'stupid? No!

2171
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:53,425
What the fuck you said?
I can't understand.

2172
01:58:53,459 --> 01:58:54,483
Say that again!

2173
01:58:54,494 --> 01:58:58,294
I said I won't, I know what
my feeling with this FBI agent.

2174
01:58:58,331 --> 01:58:59,491
What the fuck are you saying?

2175
01:59:01,367 --> 01:59:03,358
- I said..
- Are you fuckin' high?

2176
01:59:03,369 --> 01:59:06,236
Are you kidding me? I
don't wanna see more FBI!

2177
01:59:06,272 --> 01:59:08,433
Jordan! Are you fuckin' high?

2178
01:59:09,375 --> 01:59:11,434
Jordan, do me a favour.
Stay where you are,

2179
01:59:11,477 --> 01:59:13,342
don't get behind the wheel of the car,

2180
01:59:13,346 --> 01:59:14,506
I'll be there in a
moment to pick you up.

2181
01:59:15,248 --> 01:59:15,509
Jordan, Jordan!

2182
01:59:16,249 --> 01:59:18,376
After 15 years in storage,

2183
01:59:18,384 --> 01:59:22,218
the lemons had developed a delayed fuse.

2184
01:59:22,288 --> 01:59:25,519
It took 90 minutes for this little
fuckers to kick in, but once they did..

2185
01:59:26,259 --> 01:59:27,351
Pow!

2186
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,488
I mean, I'd skipped the tingle phase
and went straight to the drool phase.

2187
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:32,395
Tell me where you are, don't fuckin'..

2188
01:59:32,398 --> 01:59:37,267
This little bastard was so strong,
I discovered a whole new phase.

2189
01:59:37,303 --> 01:59:39,464
The cerebral palsy phase.

I've got it!

I can roll.

be ten thousand Swiss bankers in Geneva.

2705
02:30:39,263 --> 02:30:43,199
and Rugrat is the one dumb enough
to get himself arrested on U.S. soil.

2706
02:30:43,267 --> 02:30:44,427

2707
02:30:44,435 --> 02:30:46,494

Even more fucked was he got busted for
shit that had nothing to do with me.

2710
02:30:54,311 --> 02:30:59,339
Something about laundering drug money, to
offshore boat racing to a guy name Rocky aoki.

Beni 'fucking' hana,why, why god.

2715
02:31:09,427 --> 02:31:16,299
Why would You be so cruel as to choose a chain
of fucking Hibachi Restaurants to take me down?

2716
02:31:17,334 --> 02:31:23,273
Long story, short Saurel ratted me out, but
not before he ratted out Brad's wife Chantalle.

2717
02:31:23,307 --> 02:31:27,368

2726
02:32:08,385 --> 02:32:10,478

2727
02:32:10,521 --> 02:32:13,422

2741
02:32:56,500 --> 02:32:58,491
Irresponsble prick.

2742
02:32:59,236 --> 02:33:01,204
I'll tell you one thing.

2743
02:33:02,273 --> 02:33:05,401
That you never eat Benihana again.

2744
02:33:05,409 --> 02:33:08,310
I don't care who's birthday it is.

2745
02:33:09,246 --> 02:33:11,305
What is that Naomi actually doing?

2746
02:33:11,382 --> 02:33:14,408
She right in the house there, say
hi she probably won't wave you back.

2747
02:33:14,485 --> 02:33:17,283
Naomi, sweetheart.

2748
02:33:20,324 --> 02:33:22,224
What's up her ass, was she mad at me?

2749
02:33:22,259 --> 02:33:23,283
No you know.

2750
02:33:23,294 --> 02:33:26,354
Probably had to mortgage
the house to make bail.

2751
02:33:26,397 --> 02:33:30,299
Probably ended sell a thing in
order pay for all my lawyers.

2752
02:33:30,301 --> 02:33:33,270
It's been a night mare

02:33:42,246 --> 02:33:43,235
Jordan.

2757
02:33:43,514 --> 02:33:46,347

2763
02:34:10,274 --> 02:34:13,243
- I'll kiss you.
- Alright, enough, enough.

2764
02:34:14,411 --> 02:34:17,244
- You wanna beer, pal?
- What do you drink?

2765
02:34:17,281 --> 02:34:19,306
We got this non-alcoholic shit.

2766
02:34:19,350 --> 02:34:21,477
- What is that?
- It's non alcoholic beer.

2767
02:34:21,518 --> 02:34:23,452
It's got no alchohol.

2768
02:34:23,487 --> 02:34:26,320
- Is it beer?
- Ya, with no alchohol.

2769
02:34:26,357 --> 02:34:30,225
But you drink enough and you
drink a lot to get you fucked up.

2770
02:34:30,261 --> 02:34:32,320
No, it's no alchoholic fucking point.

2771
02:34:32,329 --> 02:34:35,355
I'm not a scientist, i dont get fuck target
but I can get you a beer, if you want..

2772
02:34:35,399 --> 02:34:38,300
I know, but i don't drink, you remember.

2773
02:34:38,335 --> 02:34:40,360
- I'm not drink anymore.
- Are you wanna go inside.

2774
02:34:40,404 --> 02:34:43,373
And blow some lime and baking powder..

2775
02:34:43,507 --> 02:34:46,374
Can't imagine ever not
enjoyed geting fucked up.

2776
02:34:46,410 --> 02:34:48,241
- Yeah.
- I loved it.

2777
02:34:48,245 --> 02:34:49,405
But i've been sobber.

2778
02:34:49,446 --> 02:34:50,435
Fucking sucks.

2779
02:34:50,481 --> 02:34:52,381
- Boring right.
- So boring.

2780
02:34:52,416 --> 02:34:54,384
Like kill myself.

2781
02:34:54,418 --> 02:34:58,479
There is a term and we dont like to
use it unless circumtances dictate..

2782
02:34:58,522 --> 02:35:03,516
.. I think they do dictate in this case and
term is Grenada, have you ever heard Grenada.

2783
02:35:03,527 --> 02:35:04,425
No i haven't.

2784
02:35:04,461 --> 02:35:14,359
Grenada very interesting because it is a small
island nation that was invaded by the United
States of America 1983 have 9000 people.

2785
02:35:14,405 --> 02:35:17,374
And essentially means is.

2786
02:35:17,374 --> 02:35:20,400
This case is unloseable.

2787
02:35:20,444 --> 02:35:25,381
So, you know, come in we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants, nobody gives a fuck.

2788
02:35:25,416 --> 02:35:27,316
I'm gonna win.

2789
02:35:27,351 --> 02:35:29,319
You Sir.

2790
02:35:30,254 --> 02:35:32,222
Are was known.

2791
02:35:32,456 --> 02:35:34,447
As a Grenada.

2792
02:35:37,328 --> 02:35:40,422
You're looking at real prison time.

2793
02:35:40,464 --> 02:35:44,230
Money laundering can get you as much 20 years.

2794
02:35:44,268 --> 02:35:48,398
And, our case gonna be stronger, if we
caught your shed and cash your mattress,.

2795
02:35:48,439 --> 02:35:50,270
Oh that right.

2796
02:35:50,374 --> 02:35:52,274
Hei Jordan.

2797
02:35:52,309 --> 02:35:57,406
Jordan, You're rotting away in
jail, 2 your kids get out the college.

2798
02:35:57,414 --> 02:36:00,281
That's not our ambition here.

2799
02:36:00,451 --> 02:36:03,249
There's other people involve in this too.

2800
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:06,483
We think, they need to see
their day in courts as well.

2801
02:36:08,525 --> 02:36:11,221
Why do I sense there's
an offer in the air?

2802
02:36:11,261 --> 02:36:12,387
He's got good sense.

2803
02:36:12,429 --> 02:36:14,363
What are you, Craskin?

2804
02:36:14,531 --> 02:36:23,303
Full cooperation, he provides us with the
comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning
the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire.

2805
02:36:23,507 --> 02:36:26,408
- Did you just say wear a wire?
- A wire.

2806
02:36:26,510 --> 02:36:29,377
Wow, wow, is that means, you
want me to rat, is that it?

2807
02:36:29,413 --> 02:36:31,244
No, i want you to cooperate.

2808
02:36:31,281 --> 02:36:33,374
- No, you want me to rat.
- Yes, we want you to rat.

2809
02:36:33,417 --> 02:36:37,478
That fucking exactly what
we want you to do, to rat.

2810
02:36:41,425 --> 02:36:43,222
How is Christy's party?

2811
02:36:43,360 --> 02:36:46,329
- Fine.
- Good.

2812
02:36:47,264 --> 02:36:49,357
Babe, i've spoke to the lawyers again today.

2813
02:36:49,433 --> 02:36:53,369
There is some really really great news.

2814
02:36:54,238 --> 02:36:57,435
Turns out you completely
off the hook, honey.

2815
02:36:57,474 --> 02:36:59,339
I know that already.

2816
02:36:59,376 --> 02:37:04,507
Right, exactly, you never did
anything wrong in first place right?

2817
02:37:05,282 --> 02:37:11,448
It turns out, all the FBI really
wants for me is to a coorperate.

2818
02:37:11,488 --> 02:37:16,289
You know.. turns out i have so much information
about the stock market and the Wallstreet..

2819
02:37:16,326 --> 02:37:21,491
That i could save the government years of
heartache not to mention countless dollars.

2820
02:37:23,300 --> 02:37:25,234
It gets even better babe.

2821
02:37:25,269 --> 02:37:31,208
Because if i do to sign cooperate, i might
only be looking at 4 short years.

2822
02:37:31,275 --> 02:37:35,405
How much case, we could start
fresh maybe sell the house.

2823
02:37:35,412 --> 02:37:39,280
And any fine that i have to pay
wouldn't due till i serve term.

2824
02:37:39,316 --> 02:37:43,275
So, we still have plenty
money left over, you know.

2825
02:37:44,288 --> 02:37:49,385
You think, of course bug me out a little
bit is this whole idea for doing it.

2826
02:37:49,426 --> 02:37:51,394
Give an information about my friends.

2827
02:37:51,495 --> 02:37:55,261
Ohh, like he said, ther is
no friend on Wallstrett right.

2828
02:37:55,265 --> 02:37:56,357
Right.

2829
02:37:56,433 --> 02:38:00,426
It's exactly silver lining to that
too honey because they said eventually.

2830
02:38:00,471 --> 02:38:03,338
Eventually everyone gonna have to
give an information on this case.

2831
02:38:03,373 --> 02:38:06,399
So at the end of the day, might
not even a factor, you know.

2832
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:10,403
- Well, that's a good news, right.
- Yeah, yeah.

2833
02:38:10,447 --> 02:38:12,506
I'm really happy for you.

2834
02:38:14,284 --> 02:38:17,412
What do you mean you happy for me?

2835
02:38:17,488 --> 02:38:21,424
- You should be happy for the both of us right?
- Yeah right.

2836
02:38:21,458 --> 02:38:22,482
Alright.

2837
02:38:24,394 --> 02:38:26,225
Come here baby.

2838
02:38:26,463 --> 02:38:29,432

2839
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:33,335

2840
02:38:33,370 --> 02:38:35,497

02:38:50,420 --> 02:38:52,479

2845
02:38:52,489 --> 02:38:56,220
