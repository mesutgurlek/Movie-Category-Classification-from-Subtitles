That's exactly why I'm not heavy
into activities.

164
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,080
- You're a big coward.
- I'm in the math club.

165
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,680
You're afraid you don't belong,
so you just dump all over it.

166
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,120
It wouldn't have
anything to do with...

167
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,860
you activities people
being assholes, would it?

168
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,590
You wouldn't know.
You don't know any of us.

169
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,000
Well, I don't know
any lepers either...

170
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,260
but I'm not joining
their fucking clubs.

171
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,170
- Watch the mouth.
- I'm in the physics club too.

172
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,510
Excuse me a sec.
What are you babbling about?

173
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,570
What I said was that...

174
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,950
I'm in the math club, the Latin club
and the physics club. Physics club.

175
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,750
Hey. Cherry.

176
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,290
- Do you belong to the physics club?
- That's an academic club.

177
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,980
So?

178
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,930
So academic clubs aren't
the same as other kinds of clubs.

179
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,300
Ah, but to dorks
like him, they are.

180
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,740
What do you guys do in your club?

181
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,470
In physics, well, we talk about
physics, uh, properties of physics.

182
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,540
So it's sort of social.

183
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,740
Demented and sad,
but social, right?

184
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,150
I guess you could consider it
a social situation.

185
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,210
Um, there are
other children in my club.

186
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,490
And, uh, at the end of the year,
we have, um...

187
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,130
- a big banquet at the Hilton.
- You load up. You party.

188
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,830
No. We get dressed up,
but we don't get high.

189
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,770
Only burners like you get high.

190
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,210
I didn't have shoes,
so I had to borrow my dad's.

191
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,940
My mom doesn't like me to wear
other people's shoes.

192
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,710
My cousin Kendall
from lndiana got high once.

193
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,940
He started eating, like,
really weird foods...

194
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,680
and then he felt
like he didn't belong anywhere.

195
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,050
Kind of "Twilight Zone," kinda.

196
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,110
Sounds like you.

197
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,350
You guys keep talking
and Vernon's gonna come in here.

198
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,490
I got a meet Saturday, and I'm not
missing it because of you boneheads.

199
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,790
Oh, wouldn't that be a bite, huh?

200
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,800
Missing a whole wrestling meet?

201
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,960
You wouldn't know about it, faggot.

202
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,030
You never competed
in your life.

203
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,900
Oh, I know.
I feel all empty inside.

204
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,380
I have such a deep admiration for guys
who roll around with other guys.

205
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,940
You'd never miss it.
You don't have any goals.

206
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,850
- But I do.
- Yeah?

207
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,680
I want to be just like you.

208
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,450
I figure all I need's
a lobotomy and some tights.

209
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,490
You wear tights?

210
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,030
No, I don't wear tights.

211
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,560
I wear the required uniform.

212
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,790
Tights.

213
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,130
Shut up.

214
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,440
Ooh.

215
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,050
There's not supposed to
be any monkey business.

216
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,610
Young man, have you
finished your paper?

217
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,160
Bender, don't screw around.

218
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,460
- What are you gonna do?
- Drop dead, I hope.

219
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,170
All right!

220
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,370
Bender, that's school property.

221
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,040
It doesn't belong to us.
It's not to be toyed with.

222
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,990
- Very funny. Fix it.
- You should fix that.

223
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,050
- Am I a genius?
- No, you're an asshole.

224
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,620
- Funny guy. Everyone, just shh.
- Fix the door, Bender!

225
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,460
- I know what I'm doing.
- Fix the door!

226
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,020
Shut up!

227
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,690
[ Vernon ] goddamn it!

228
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,030
Why is that door closed?

229
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,330
Why is that door closed!

230
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,070
How are we supposed to know?
We can't move, right?

231
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,050
Why?

232
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,520
We're just sitting here,
like we're supposed to.

233
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,720
Who closed that door?

234
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,560
- I think a screw fell out of it.
- It just closed, sir.

235
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,900
- Who!
- Aah!

236
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,130
- She doesn't talk, sir.
- Eek!

237
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,300
- give me that screw.
- I don't have it.

238
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,670
You want me
to shake it out of you?

239
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,080
I don't have it.
Screws fall out all the time.

240
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,740
- The world's an imperfect place.
- give it to me, Bender.

241
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,810
- Sir, why would anybody steal a screw?
- Watch it, young lady.

242
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,520
The door's way too heavy, sir.

243
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,430
Damn it!

244
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,310
Andrew Clark, get up here.

245
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,850
Front and center.
Let's go.

246
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,050
- How come Andrew gets to get up?
- [ Vernon ] That's right.

247
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,390
If he gets up, we'll all get up.
It'll be anarchy.

248
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,350
- Okay, watch the magazines.
- [ Bender ] It's out of my hands.

249
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,670
That's very clever, sir...

250
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,070
but what if there's a fire?

251
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,170
I think violating fire codes...

252
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,240
and endangering the lives
of children would be unwise...

253
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,300
at this juncture
in your career, sir.

254
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,080
What are you doing?
get this out, for god's sake.

255
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:33,590
- What's the matter with you?
- The school's equipped with fire exits.

256
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,960
- Show Dick some respect.
- Let's go.

257
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,530
get in your seat.

258
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,800
I expected more
from a varsity letterman.

259
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,940
You're not fooling anybody, Bender.

260
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,940
The next screw that
falls out will be you.

261
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,640
Eat my shorts.

262
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,040
What was that?

263
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,210
Eat...

264
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,340
my...

265
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,610
shorts.

266
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,680
You just bought
another Saturday, mister.

267
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,550
Oh, I'm crushed.

268
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,420
- One more right there.
- I'm free the next Saturday.

269
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,690
- Beyond that, I'll check my calendar.
- good! It's gonna be filled.

270
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,390
We'll keep going.
You want another one?

271
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,900
Say the word. Just say it.

272
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,460
Instead of going to prison,
you'll come here.

273
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,870
- Are you through?
- No.

274
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,930
- I'm doing society a favor.
- So?

275
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,740
That's another!

276
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,650
I've got you the rest of your life
if you don't watch it.

277
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,710
- You want another?
- Yes.

278
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,950
You got it!
That's another one, pal.

279
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,080
Cut it out!

280
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,650
- Stop.
- You through?

281
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,460
- Not even close, bud.
- good!

282
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,620
- You got one more.
- You really think I give a shit?

283
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,600
Another.

284
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,930
- You through?
- How many is that?

285
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:57,370
That's seven including the first one
when you asked...

286
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,930
whether Barry Manilow knew
he raided his closet.

287
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,500
- Now it's eight. Stay out of it.
- Sir, it's seven.

288
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,570
Shut up, peewee.

289
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,810
You're mine, Bender.
For two months, I got you.

290
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,010
I got you.

291
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,150
What can I say?
I'm thrilled.

292
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,160
That's exactly what you
want them to believe.

293
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,890
You know something?

294
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,630
You should spend more time
doing something with yourself...

295
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,360
and less time trying
to impress people.

296
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,170
Might be better off.

297
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,170
Right, that's it!

298
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,470
I'll be outside those doors.

299
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,140
The next time I have to come in here,
I'm cracking skulls.

300
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,450
Fuck you!

301
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,360
Fuck.

302
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,670
Wake up!

303
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,270
Who has to go to the lavatory?

304
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,030
That's real intelligent.

305
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,540
You're right.

306
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,010
It's wrong to destroy literature.

307
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,980
It's such fun to read.

308
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,440
And...

309
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,550
"Molay" really pumps my 'nads.

310
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,920
Moliere.

311
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:35,050
I love his work.

312
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,730
Big deal.

313
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,170
Nothing to do,
locked in a vacancy.

314
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,260
Ah, speak for yourself.

315
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,310
You think I'd speak for you?

316
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't know your language.

317
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,410
Hey...

318
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,780
you grounded tonight?

319
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,310
I don't know. My mom said I was,
but my dad said to blow her off.

320
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,330
There's a big party at Stubby's.
Parents are in Europe.

321
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,560
- It should be pretty wild.
- Yeah?

322
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,590
- Yeah. Are you going to go?
- I doubt it.

323
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:19,760
How come?

324
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,830
If I disobey my mother,
it's because my father says it's okay.

325
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,070
It's like this whole monster deal.
It's endless and a total drag.

326
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,880
- Any minute, divorce.
- Who do you like better?

327
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,850
- What?
- You like your old man better?

328
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,550
- They're both screwed.
- I mean if you had to choose.

329
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,620
I don't know.

330
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,350
I'd probably go live
with my brother.

331
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,500
I don't think either one
gives a shit about me.

332
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,630
They use me to get back
at each other.

333
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,030
Ha!

334
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,410
Shut up!

335
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,040
- You're feeling sorry for yourself.
- If I didn't, nobody else would.

336
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,810
You're breaking my heart.

337
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,550
- Sporto?
- What?

338
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,650
You get along with your parents?

339
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,320
If I say yes,
I'm an idiot, right?

340
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,730
You're an idiot anyway...

341
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,460
but if you say yes,
you're a liar too.

342
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,240
You know something, man?

343
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,040
If we weren't in school right now,
I'd waste you.

344
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,950
Can you hear this?

345
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,550
You want me to turn it up?

346
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,120
Hey, fellas, I mean--

347
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,780
I don't like my parents, either.
I mean, I don't--

348
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,720
I mean, I don't get along
with them when...

349
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,700
their idea of parental compassion
is just, you know...

350
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,970
wacko, you know?

351
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
- Dork.
- Yeah?

352
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,200
You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

353
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,310
That's the problem.

354
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,540
Look, I can see you're getting
all bunged up...

355
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,780
for them making you wear
these clothes...

356
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,880
but, face it,
you're a neo-maxi-zoom-dweeby.

357
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,620
What would you do if you weren't out
making yourself a better citizen?

358
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,920
Why do you have to
insult everybody?

359
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,350
I'm being honest, asshole.

360
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,630
I would expect you
to know the difference.

361
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,570
- Well, he's got a name.
- Yeah?

362
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,970
Yeah. What's your name?

363
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,030
- Brian.
- See?

364
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,370
My condolences.

365
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,410
What's your name?

366
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,710
What's yours?

367
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,650
- Claire.
- Claire?

368
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,590
- Claire. It's a family name.
- It's a fat girl's name.

369
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,320
- Thank you.
- Your welcome.

370
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,690
- I'm not fat.
- Not now...

371
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,060
but I can see you really
pushing maximum density.

372
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,460
You see, I'm not sure
if you know this...

373
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,870
but there are
two kinds of fat people.

374
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,200
There's fat people
that were born to be fat...

375
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,610
and fat people that were
once thin but became fat.

376
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,840
When you look at them, you can
sorta see that thin person inside.

377
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,610
You're gonna get married,
squeeze out a few puppies and then...

378
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,440
Oh.

379
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,050
Obscene finger gestures
from such a pristine girl.

380
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,460
I'm not that pristine.

381
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,260
Are you a virgin?

382
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,370
I'll bet you
a million dollars that you are.

383
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,740
Let's end the suspense.

384
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,780
Is it gonna to be
a white wedding?

385
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,940
Why don't you just shut up?

386
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,990
Have you kissed
a boy on the mouth?

387
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,220
Have you ever been felt up...

388
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,490
over the bra...

389
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,150
under the blouse...

390
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,090
shoes off...

391
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,760
hoping to god
your parents don't walk in?

392
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,270
Do you want me to puke?

393
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,900
Over the panties...

394
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,780
no bra...

395
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,440
blouse unbuttoned...

396
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,110
Calvin's in a ball on the front seat
past 11:00 on a school night?

397
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,580
Leave her alone.

398
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,600
I said leave her alone.

399
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,470
You going to make me?

400
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,710
Yeah.

401
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,210
You and how many
of your friends?

402
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,550
Just me.

403
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,080
Just you and me.

404
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,990
Two hits. Me hitting you.
You hitting the floor.

405
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,050
Anytime you're ready, pal.

406
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,440
I don't want to get
into this with you, man.

407
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,330
Why not?

408
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,800
'Cause I'd kill you.

409
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,680
It's real simple.

410
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,150
I'd kill you, and your
fucking parents would sue me.

411
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,090
And it'd be a big mess, and I don't
care enough about you to bother.

412
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,690
Chicken shit.

413
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,370
Let's end this now.

414
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,600
You don't talk to her.

415
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,700
You don't look at her.

416
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,050
And you don't even think about her!
Understand me?

417
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,280
I'm trying to help her.

418
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,370
Brian, how you doing?

419
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,210
Your dad work here?

420
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,910
- Uh, Carl?
- What?

421
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,190
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

422
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,750
- How does one become a janitor?
- You want to be a janitor?

423
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,990
No, I want to know
how one becomes a janitor...

424
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,660
because Andrew's very interested
in a career in the custodial arts.

425
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,100
Really?

426
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,740
You think I'm some
untouchable peasant, serf, peon?

427
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,280
Yeah?

428
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,840
Maybe so.

429
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,310
From following a broom
after shitheads like you...

430
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,610
I've learned
a couple of things.

431
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,250
I look through your letters.

432
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,590
Look through your lockers.

433
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,180
I listen to your conversations.
You don't know that, but I do.

434
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,390
I am the eyes and ears
of this institution, my friends.

435
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,200
By the way,
that clock's 20 minutes fast.

436
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,360
Shit.

437
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,050
[ Whistling "Colonel Bogie's March" ]

438
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,180
[ Whistling "Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony" ]

439
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,310
All right, girls.
Thirty minutes for lunch.

440
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,550
- Here?
- Here.

441
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,390
I think the cafeteria would be
a more suitable place, sir.

442
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,630
I don't care what
you think, Andrew.

443
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,860
Dick.

444
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,370
Excuse me, Rich.

445
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,770
Will milk be made available?

446
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,400
We're extremely thirsty.

447
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,240
I have a really low tolerance
for dehydration.

448
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,110
I've seen her dehydrate, sir.
It's pretty gross.

449
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,080
- Relax. I'll get it.
- Uh-uh-uh.

450
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,950
grab some wood, bub.

451
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,780
You think I was born yesterday?

452
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,550
Think I'm going to let you
roam these halls?

453
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,790
You.

454
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,360
And you.

455
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,600
Hey!

456
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,170
What's her name?
Wake her up.

457
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,040
Hey! Come on!
On your feet, Missy. Let's go.

458
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,140
This isn't a rest home.

459
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,270
There's soda
in the teachers' lounge.

460
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,440
Let's go!

461
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,980
So...

462
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,050
what's your poison?

463
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,180
What do you drink?

464
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,790
Okay. Forget I asked.

465
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,460
Vodka.

466
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,740
Vodka?

467
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,240
When do you drink vodka?

468
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,370
Whenever.

469
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,070
- A lot?
- Tons.

470
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,820
Is that why
you're here today?

471
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,250
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

472
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,420
Um...

473
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,690
I'm here today because...

474
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,200
my coach and my father...

475
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:20,000
don't want me
to blow my ride.

476
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,230
I get treated differently...

477
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:26,200
because Coach thinks I'm a winner.
So does my old man.

478
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,840
I'm not a winner
because I want to be.

479
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,570
I'm a winner because
I have strength and speed.

480
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,150
Kinda like a racehorse.

481
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,210
That's about how involved I am
in what's happening to me.

482
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,720
Yeah?

483
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,720
That's very interesting.

484
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,620
Now, why don't you tell me
why you're really in here?

485
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,290
Forget it.

486
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,700
Claire, want to see a picture of a guy
with elephantitis of the nuts?

487
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,510
- It's pretty tasty.
- No, thank you.

488
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:07,570
How do you think
he rides a bike?

489
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,220
Oh, Claire?

490
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,190
Would you ever consider
dating a guy like this?

491
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,160
- Can't you just leave me alone?
- If he had a great personality...

492
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,720
was a good dancer
and had a cool car?

493
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,790
You'd probably have to
ride in the backseat...

494
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,160
because his nuts
would ride shotgun.

495
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,330
- You know what I wish I was doing?
- Careful. Brian is a cherry.

496
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,100
- Cherry?
- I wish I was on a plane...

497
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,510
- to France.
- I'm not a cherry.

498
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,210
- When have you ever been laid?
- I've laid lots of times.

499
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,080
- Name one.
- She lives in Canada.

500
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,490
Met her at Niagara Falls.
You wouldn't know her.

501
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,390
Ever laid anyone around here?

502
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,790
Oh. You and Claire did it?

503
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,460
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

504
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,800
- Drop it. We'll talk about it later.
- Drop what?

505
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,700
Brian's telling me that,
in addition to a number of girls...

506
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,940
in the Niagara Falls area,
that presently...

507
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,100
you and he are
riding the hobby horse.

508
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,410
- Little pig.
- No, I'm not!

509
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,970
John said I was a cherry,
and I said I wasn't. That's it.

510
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,680
What were you motioning
to Claire for?

511
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,120
- I don't appreciate this, Brian.
- He is lying.

512
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,220
You weren't motioning
to Claire?

513
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,460
- You know he's lying.
- Were you or were you not?

514
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,330
Yeah, but it was only--

515
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,500
It was only because
I didn't want her to know I'm a virgin.

516
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,940
Excuse me for being a virgin.

517
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,100
Why didn't you want me to know?

518
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,240
Because it's personal.
It's my personal, private business.

519
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,580
It doesn't sound like
you're doing any business.

520
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,310
I think it's okay
for a guy to be a virgin.

521
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,950
You do?

522
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,530
- What's in there?
- guess.

523
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,860
Where's your lunch?

524
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,130
You're wearing it.

525
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,200
You're nauseating.

526
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,320
What's that?

527
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,020
- Sushi.
- Sushi?

528
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,390
Rice, raw fish and seaweed.

529
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,500
You won't accept a guy's tongue
in your mouth but you'll eat that?

530
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,170
Can I eat?

531
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,680
I don't know.
give it a try.

532
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,570
What's your problem?

533
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,510
What are we having?

534
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:33,570
Uh...it's your standard
regular lunch, I guess.

535
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,180
Milk?

536
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,410
Soup.

537
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,690
- Uh...that's apple juice.
- I can read.

538
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,290
PB&J with the crusts cut off.

539
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,800
Well, Brian, this is
a very nutritious lunch.

540
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,770
All the food groups
are represented.

541
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:00,010
Did your Mom marry Mr. Rogers?

542
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,540
- No, Mr. Johnson.
- Ah.

543
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,640
Here's my impression...

544
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,310
of life at big Bri's house.

545
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,920
Son?

546
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,650
Yeah, Dad?

547
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,890
How's your day, pal?

548
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,220
great, Dad. How's yours?

549
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,860
Super.

550
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:29,960
Say, son, how'd you like
to go fishing this weekend?

551
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,140
great, Dad, but I've got
homework to do.

552
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,810
That's all right, son.
You can do it on the boat.

553
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,750
gee!

554
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:47,090
Dear, isn't our son swell?

555
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,950
Yes, dear.
Isn't life swell?

556
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,150
Oh.

All right.
What about your family?

560
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,840
- Who, mine?
- Yeah.

561
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,740
It's real easy.

562

You forgot ugly,
lazy and disrespectful.

569
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,810
Shut up, bitch!

570
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,310
go fix me a turkey potpie.

571
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,140

Fuck you.

- Is that for real?
- You wanna come over some time?

579
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,730
That's bullshit.
It's all part of your image.

580
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,770
- I don't believe a word of it.
- You don't believe me?

- No.
- No?

582

Did I stutter?

Do you believe this?
Huh?

584

It's about the size of a cigar.
Do I stutter?

This is what you get in my house
when you spill paint in the garage.

00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,300
Three...

639
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,010
two...

640
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,570
one!

641
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:54,240
Ahh!

642
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,550
[ Vernon ] Bender! Bender!
What is this?

643
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,210
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

644
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,530
Out. That's it, Bender.
Out. It's over.

645
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,490
- Don't you want to hear my excuse?
- Out.

646
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,660
- I might try out for a scholarship.
- give me the ball.

647
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,490
give me that ball.

648
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,350
get your stuff.
Let's go.

649
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,580
Mr. Wise guy took it upon himself
to go to the gymnasium.

650
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,320
I'm sorry to inform you...

651
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,060
you'll be without his services
for the rest of the day.

652
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:49,870
- B-o-o h-o-o.
- Everything's a big joke, huh, Bender?

653
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:54,000
The false alarm you pulled Friday.
False alarms are really funny.

654
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,470
What if your home--
What if your family--

655
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,380
What if your dope was on fire?

656
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:04,720
Impossible, sir.
It's in Johnson's underwear.

657
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,810
[ Vernon ] You think he's funny?

658
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:10,720
You think this is cute?
He's "bitchin"? Is that it?

659
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:13,260
Let me tell you something.

660
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,560
Look at him.

661
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:17,660
He's a bum.

662
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,720
Want to see something funny?

663
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,640
You go visit John Bender in five years.
You'll see how funny he is.

664
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,170
What's the matter, John?
You gonna cry?

665
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,250
Let's go.

666
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:41,260
Keep your fuckin' hands
off me!

667
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,820
I expect better manners
from you, Dick.

668
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:48,820
For better hallway vision.

669
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,970
That's the last time, Bender.

670
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,340
The last time you ever make me
look bad in front of them.

671
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,250
I make $31,000 a year
and have a home.

672
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,780
I'm not throwing it away
on some punk like you.

673
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:12,950
But someday, man, someday...

674
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,550
when you're gone and have
forgotten about this place...

675
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,960
and they've forgotten you, and you're
wrapped up in your pathetic life...

676
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,390
I'm gonna be there.

677
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,190
That's right.

678
00:50:24,270 --> 00:50:26,600
I'm gonna kick the living shit
out of you.

679
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,660
I'm gonna knock your dick
in the dirt.

680
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:35,740
- You threatening me?
- What are you gonna do about it?

681
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,740
You think anybody
will believe you?

682
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,680
You think anybody's
gonna take your word over mine?

683
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:50,180
I'm a man of respect around here.
They love me. I'm a swell guy.

684
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,420
You're a lying sack of shit,
and everybody knows it.

685
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:58,930
Oh, you're a real tough guy.
Hey, hey. Come on.

686
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:02,900
get on your feet, pal!
Let's find out how tough you are!

687
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:05,670
I want to know right now
how tough you are.

688
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,670
I'll give you the first punch.

689
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,510
Come on. Right here.
Just take the first shot.

690
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,770
Please. I'm begging you.
Take a shot. Right here.

691
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,480
Just take one shot.
That's all I need. Just one swing.

692
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,950
That's what I thought.

693
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:33,100
You're a gutless turd.

694
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,910
A naked blonde walks into a bar...

695
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,910
with a poodle under one arm...

696
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,920
and a salami under the other.

697
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,420
She lays the poodle on the table.

698
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:29,360
Bartender says,
"You won't be needing a drink."

699
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:31,090
Naked lady says--

700
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,930
Oh, shit!

701
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,260
Jesus Christ almighty!

702
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,430
Forgot my pencil.

703
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,770
[ Vernon ] goddamn it!

704
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,550
What in god's name
is going on in here?

705
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:01,150
- What was that ruckus?
- What ruckus?

706
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,780
I was in my office
and I heard a ruckus.

707
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:07,790
- Could you describe the ruckus, sir?
- Watch your tongue, young man.

708
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,430
Ah!

709
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,060
What is this?

710
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,400
- Vvvvt!
- What is that?

711
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:17,670
What is that noise?

712
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,970
- What noise?
- Really, sir, there wasn't any noise.

713
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,210
- Ah!
- Ah!

714
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,310
Ow!

715
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,710
Was that the noise
you were talking about?

716
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:37,020
That was not the noise
I was talking about.

717
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:41,260
I may not have caught you
in the act this time...

718
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:43,520
- but you can bet I will.
- [ Laughing ]

719
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,930
You make book on that, missy.

720
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,700
And you!

721
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:52,230
I will not be made a fool of.

722
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,580
Ah!

723
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,620
It was an accident.

724
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,630
You're an asshole.

725
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:13,180
Sue me.

726
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,190
Ahab, can I have all my doobage?

727
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,710
Y o, wastoid, you're not
gonna blaze up in here.

728
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,690
Shit.

729
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:23,620
Chicks cannot hold dey smoke.

730
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,680
That's what it is.

731
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,800
[ Claire ] Do you know
how popular I am?

732
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:34,700
I am so popular.

733
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:37,760
Everybody loves me
so much at this school.

734
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,000
Sure they do.

735
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,850
Whoo!

736
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,830
- Ow!
- Aagh!

737
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:55,310
Aaahhh!

738
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,090
Mister...

739
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,850
Oh, Mr. Tierney.

740
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:09,520
"A history of
slight mental illness."

741
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,690
No wonder
he's so fucked up.

742
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:14,200
good afternoon, Dick.

743
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:15,630
Hey, Carl.

744
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,000
How you doing?
What's up?

745
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,730
Not much.

746
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:21,970
What are you doing
in the basement files?

747
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,410
Oh, nothing.
Just a little homework.

748
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,470
- Homework, huh?
- Yeah.

749
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,010
Confidential files, huh?

750
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,880
Look, Carl, this is a highly
sensitive area, and I'll tell you...

751
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,120
certain people would be
very, very embarrassed.

752
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,860
I'd really appreciate it
if this would be something...

753
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:44,360
that you and I could--
we could keep between us.

754
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:48,390
- What'll you do for me, man?
- What would you like?

755
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:51,300
- got 50 bucks?
- What?

756
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:53,200
Fifty bucks.

757
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,780
No, no, no, man.

758
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,070
You got a middle name?

759
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,740
Yeah, I guess.

760
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,880
Your middle name is Ralph.

761
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,440
As in "puke."

762
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,520
Your birthday is March 12th...

763
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,520
you're 5'9 1/2"...

764
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,530
you weigh 130 pounds...

765
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:16,030
and your social security number...

766
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,760
is 049-38-0913.

767
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,200
Wow!

768
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:25,710
Are you psychic?

769
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,260
No.

770
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:32,600
How do you know
all this about me?

771
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:37,480
I stole your wallet.

772
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:38,780
- give it to me.
- No.

773
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,720
give it.

774
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,550
- This is great. You're a thief too?
- I'm not a thief.

775
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:46,960
- Multi-talented.
- What's there to steal?

776
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,930
- Two bucks and a beaver shot.
- A what?

777
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,630
He's got a nudie picture.
I saw it. It's perverted.

778
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,890
Let's see it.

779
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,780
- Are all these your girlfriends?
- Some of them.

780
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,840
What about the others?

781
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,540
Well, some I consider
my girlfriends...

782
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,250
- and some I just consider.
- Consider what?

783
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,420
Whether or not
I want to hang out with them.

784
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:18,980
You don't believe
in one guy, one girl?

785
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:24,220
- Do you?
- Yeah. That's the way it should be.

786
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,760
- Well, not for me.
- Why not?

787
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,600
How come you got
so much shit in your purse?

788
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,770
- Why do you have so many girlfriends?
- I asked you first.

789
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,330
I don't know.
I guess I never throw anything away.

790
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,570
Neither do l.

791
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,810
Oh.

792
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,380
This is the worst
fake l.D. I've ever seen.

793
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,090
You realize you made yourself 68?

794
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:53,090
- I know. I goofed it.
- What do you need a fake l.D. for?

795
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,150
So I can vote.

796
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,360
You want to see
what's in my bag?

797
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:00,870
- No.
- No.

798
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,070
Holy shit.

799
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:23,350
- What is all that stuff?
- Do you always carry this much shit?

800
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:25,620
Yeah.

801
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:29,390
I always carry
this much shit in my bag.

802
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,400
You never know
when you may have to jam.

803
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:36,770
Are you going to be,
like, a shopping bag lady?

804
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,470
Like, sit in alleyways
and talk to buildings.

805
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:45,640
- Wear men's shoes.
- I'll do what I have to do.

806
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,700
Why do you have to do anything?

807
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,680
My home life...

808
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:55,010
is unsatisfying.

809
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:59,420
You'd subject yourself to the
violent dangers of Chicago's streets...

810
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:01,890
because your home life
is unsatisfying?

811
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,090
I don't have to run away
and live in the street.

812
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:06,260
I can run away,
and I can go to the ocean...

813
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:09,860
the country, the mountains,
lsrael, Africa...

814
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,870
Afghanistan.

815
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:22,810
Andy, you want to get in on this?

816
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,120
Allison says she
wants to run away...

817
01:02:26,190 --> 01:02:30,210
because her home life
is unsatisfying.

818
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,780
Well, everyone's home life
is unsatisfying.

819
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,530
If it wasn't, people would
live with their parents forever.

820
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,430
Yeah, I understand,
but I think hers...

821
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:44,490
goes beyond
what guys like you and me...

822
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:46,970
consider "normal" unsatisfying.

823
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,980
Never mind. Forget it.
Everything's cool.

824
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:55,110
- What's the deal?
- No. There's no deal, sporto.

825
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,410
- Forget it. Leave me alone.
- Wait a minute.

826
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:01,420
You're carrying all that crap
in your purse.

827
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:05,080
Either you really want to run away
or you want people to think that.

828
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,850
Eat shit.

829
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,660
The girl is an island
unto herself. Okay?

830
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,440
Hi.

831
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,240
- You want to talk?
- No.

832
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,370
Why not?

833
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,080
go away.

834
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,010
- Where do you want me to go?
- go away.

835
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:49,670
- You have problems.
- Oh, I have problems?

836
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:52,710
You do everything everybody tells you!
That is a problem.

837
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,370
Okay, fine. But I didn't dump
my purse out on the couch...

838
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,430
and invite people
into my problems.

839
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,110
Did l?

840
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:10,320
So what's wrong?
What is it?

841
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,100
Is it bad? Real bad?

842
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:22,060
Parents?

843
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,310
Yeah.

844
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,890
What did they do to you?

845
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,190
They ignore me.

846
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,900
Yeah.

847
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,910
Yeah.

848
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:10,950
What did you want to be
when you were young?

849
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:14,110
I wanted to be John Lennon.

850
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:16,590
Carl, don't be a goof.

851
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,290
I'm trying to be serious.

852
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:23,190
Carl, I've been
teaching for 22 years.

853
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,370
And each year...

854
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,630
these kids get more arrogant.

855
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,140
Aw, bullshit, man.

856
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,640
Come on, Vern.

857
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:35,230
The kids haven't
changed, you have.

858
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:39,440
You're teaching because you thought
it would be fun.

859
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:42,680
Thought you could have
summer vacations off.

860
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,480
Then you discovered
it was work.

861
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,540
That bummed you out.

862
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:51,610
These kids turned on me.

863
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:55,960
They think I'm a big fucking joke.

864
01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:57,460
Come off it.

865
01:05:57,530 --> 01:05:59,470
If you were 16...

866
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,300
what would you think of you?

867
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:06,500
Do you think I care
what these kids think?

868
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,060
Yes, I do.

869
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,580
Think about this.

870
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:13,580
When we get old...

871
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:17,110
these kids will
be running the country.

872
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,410
Yeah.

873
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:22,150
This thought
wakes me at night--

874
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:24,190
When I get older...

875
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:27,820
these kids will take care of me.

876
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,360
I wouldn't count on it.

877
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:38,040
What would I do
for a million bucks?

878
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:40,630
As little as I had to.

879
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,810
- That's boring.
- How am I supposed to answer?

880
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,340
The idea is to search your mind
for the absolute limit.

881
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:52,550
Like, would you
drive to school naked?

882
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:00,390
- Would I have to get out of the car?
- Of course.

883
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:04,760
- In the spring or winter?
- Doesn't matter. Spring.

884
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:08,370
- In the front or back of school?
- Either one.

885
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,270
Yes.

886
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,670
I'd do that.

887
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:16,140
I'll do anything sexual.
I don't need a million dollars either.

888
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:20,580
- You're lying.
- I already have.

889
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:24,080
I've done just about everything
except a few things that are illegal.

890
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:27,320
I'm a nymphomaniac.

891
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,920
Lie.

892
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:34,990
- Are your parents aware of this?
- I've only told my shrink.

893
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:39,330
- What did he do when you told him?
- He nailed me.

894
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,190
Very nice.

895
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:47,930
I don't think, from a legal standpoint,
what he did...

896
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:50,440
can be construed as rape
since I paid him.

897
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:54,610
- He's an adult.
- Yeah. He's married too.

898
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:58,950
Ugh. Do you have any idea
how completely gross that is?

899
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:01,780
- Well, the first few times--
- "The first few times"!

900
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,820
- You mean he did it more than once?
- Sure.

901
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:08,190
- Are you crazy?
- Obviously. She's screwing her shrink.

902
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,620
Have you ever done it?

903
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:17,000
I don't even have a psychiatrist.

904
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:19,400
Have you ever done it
with a normal person?

905
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:23,070
- Didn't we already cover this?
- You never answered.

906
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:27,950
I won't discuss my private life
with total strangers.

907
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:31,420
- It's kind of a double-edged sword.
- A what?

908
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:34,490
Well, if you say you haven't,
you're a prude.

909
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,720
If you say you have,
you're a slut.

910
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,150
It's a trap.
You want to, but you can't.

911
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:43,660
Then when you do,
you wish you didn't. Right?

912
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:47,100
- Wrong.
- Or are you a tease?

913
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,130
She's a tease.

914
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,690
I'm sure.
Why don't you forget it?

915
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:54,040
You're a tease and you know it.
All girls are teases.

916
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:56,340
She's only a tease
if what she does gets you hot.

917
01:08:56,410 --> 01:09:00,640
- I don't do anything!
- That's why you're a tease.

918
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:04,210
- Let me ask you something.
- I told you everything.

919
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:07,080
Doesn't it bother you to sleep around
without being in love?

920
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:10,850
- Don't you want respect?
- I don't screw to get respect.

921
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:12,920
That's the difference
between you and me.

922
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:14,980
That's not the only difference.

923
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,900
- Face it. You're a tease.
- I'm not a tease!

924
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:20,870
Sure you are. Sex is your weapon.
You said it yourself.

925
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:22,960
You use it to get respect.

926
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,800
I never said that.
She twisted my words around.

927
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:29,970
- What do you use it for then?
- I don't use it, period!

928
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,670
Oh, are you medically frigid
or is it psychological?

929
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:37,050
I didn't mean it that way.
You're putting words into my mouth!

930
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,950
Just answer the question.

931
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,250
- [ Andy ] Be honest.
- [ Brian ] No big deal. Answer it.

932
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,310
- Answer the question, Claire.
- Talk to us.

933
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,860
[ All The guys ]
Come on. Answer it.

934
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:50,890
- [ Bender ] It's only one question.
- No! I never did it!

935
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,330
I never did it either.

936
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,970
I'm not a nymphomaniac.

937
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,030
I'm a compulsive liar.

938
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:07,670
You are such a bitch!

939
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:11,010
You did that on purpose
just to fuck me over.

940
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:14,710
I would do it.
If you love someone, it's okay.

941
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:18,520
I can't believe you.
You're so weird.

942
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:21,080
You don't say anything all day.
Then, when you open your mouth...

943
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:24,150
you unload all these
tremendous lies all over me.

944
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:27,830
You're just pissed off because
she got you to admit to something.

945
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,230
Fine, but that doesn't make it
any less bizarre.

946
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,930
What's bizarre?
We're all pretty bizarre.

947
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:36,700
Some of us are better at hiding it.

948
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:38,840
How are you bizarre?

949
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,110
He can't think for himself.

950
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,510
She's right.

951
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:50,390
Know what I did to get in here?

952
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:56,520
I taped Larry Lester's
buns together.

953
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,220
That was you?

954
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,730
You know him?

955
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,770
Yeah, I know him.

956
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:06,140
Then you know how hairy he is.

957
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:08,830
When they pulled the tape off...

958
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:12,040
most of his hair
and some skin came too.

959
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:13,440
Oh, my god.

960
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:16,940
And the bizarre thing is...

961
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:20,050
that I did it for my old man.

962
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,120
I tortured this poor kid...

963
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,930
because I wanted him
to think I was cool.

964
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,850
He was always going off about...

965
01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:34,220
you know, when he was in school...

966
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:37,030
all the wild things
he used to do.

967
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:41,170
I got the feeling
he was disappointed...

968
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,570
that I never cut loose
on anyone, right?

969
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:48,870
So I'm sitting in the locker room...

970
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:52,650
and I'm taping up my knee...

971
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:56,680
and Larry's undressing...

972
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,090
a couple of lockers down from me.

973
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,860
And he's kind of--

974
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:07,290
He's kind of skinny, weak.

975
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,000
I started thinking
about my father...

976
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:15,570
and his attitude
about weakness.

977
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:19,400
The next thing I knew...

978
01:12:21,150 --> 01:12:24,680
I jumped on top of him
and started wailing on him.

979
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:30,380
My friends just laughed
and cheered me on.

980
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:35,560
And afterwards...

981
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,400
when I was sitting
in Vernon's office...

982
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:45,160
all I could think about...

983
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:48,330
was Larry's father...

984
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:52,110
and Larry having to go home...

985
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:58,210
and explain what happened to him.

986
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,220
And the humiliation...

987
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:09,350
the fucking humiliation
he must have felt.

988
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:15,430
It must have been unreal.

989
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:21,170
How do you apologize
for something like that?

990
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,310
There's no way.

991
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:34,220
It's all because
of me and my old man.

992
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,950
god, I fucking hate him.

993
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:44,190
He's like this--

994
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:47,560
He's like this mindless machine
I can't relate to anymore.

995
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:51,070
"Andrew!

996
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:54,070
You've got to be number one!

997
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,170
I won't tolerate
any losers in this family.

998
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,240
Your intensity
is for shit!

999
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,780
Win! Win! Win!"

1000
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:05,980
You son of a bitch.

1001
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:12,080
You know, sometimes,
I wish my knee would give.

1002
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:16,120
Then I wouldn't be able
to wrestle anymore.

1003
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,790
Then he could forget all about me.

1004
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:23,970
I think your old man and mine
should get together and go bowling.

1005
01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:32,140
Like with my grades...

1006
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:34,650
Iike when l-- when l--

1007
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,650
Iike when I step outside
of myself, you know?

1008
01:14:42,490 --> 01:14:44,480
And I see me...

1009
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:50,760
I don't like what I see.

1010
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:52,360
I really don't.

1011
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:54,920
What's wrong with you?

1012
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,940
Why don't you like yourself?

1013
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:01,340
Sounds stupid, but...

1014
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,700
because I'm failing shop.

1015
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,680
We had this assignment,
you know...

1016
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:12,340
to make this ceramic elephant.

1017
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:14,620
And, um...

1018
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:16,120
we're supposed to--

1019
01:15:16,190 --> 01:15:18,620
It was like a lamp.

1020
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:23,190
When you pull the trunk,
the light goes on.

1021
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:26,760
My light didn't go on.

1022
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,390
I got an "F" on it.

1023
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,670
I've never got an "F" in my life.

1024
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:37,700
When I signed up for the course...

1025
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:39,840
I thought I was playing it smart.

1026
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,350
I thought, "I'll take shop.
It'll be such an easy way...

1027
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,410
to maintain
my grade point average."

1028
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,480
Why'd you think it'd be easy?

1029
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:51,010
Have you seen
some of the dopes that take shop?

1030
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:55,030
I take shop.
You must be a fucking idiot.

1031
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,890
Because I can't make a lamp?

1032
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,560
No, you're a genius
because you can't make a lamp.

1033
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:04,160
- What do you know about trigonometry?
- I could care less about it.

1034
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,100
Without trigonometry,
there'd be no engineering.

1035
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:10,840
- Without lamps, there'd be no light.
- So neither of you is better--

1036
01:16:10,910 --> 01:16:14,280
I can write with my toes.

1037
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:18,780
I can also eat, brush my teeth--

1038
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:22,620
- With your feet?
- Play the piano.

1039
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:26,560
- I can make spaghetti.
- What can you do?

1040
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:31,460
I can, uh,
tape all your buns together.

1041
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:35,430
- I want to see what Claire can do.
- I can't do anything.

1042
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:37,230
Everybody can do something.

1043
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:41,300
There's one thing I can do.

1044
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:43,470
Forget it.
It's way too embarrassing.

1045
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:47,380
Ever seen "Wild Kingdom"?
He's been on for 30 years.

1046
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,210
Okay.

1047
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:53,020
You have to swear to god
you won't laugh.

1048
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,220
Okay.

1049
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:03,790
I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

1050
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,740
That's great!

1051
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:22,780
Where'd you learn to do that?

1052
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:24,650
Camp, seventh grade.

1053
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,580
That was great, Claire.

1054
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:35,960
My image of you
is totally blown.

1055
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:38,690
You're a shit.
Don't do that to her.

1056
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:41,460
- You swore to god you wouldn't laugh.
- Am I laughing?

1057
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,160
You fucking prick!

1058
01:17:46,210 --> 01:17:48,870
What do you care what I think?

1059
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:52,610
I don't even count, right?

1060
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:56,380
I could disappear forever
and it wouldn't make any difference.

1061
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:02,720
I may as well not even exist
at this school. Remember?

1062
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:08,960
And, you,
don't like me anyway.

1063
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:11,930
I have just as
many feelings as you do.

1064
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,660
And it hurts just as much
when somebody steps on them.

1065
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:16,630
god, you're so pathetic!

1066
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,690
Don't you ever...

1067
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,760
ever, compare yourself
to me, okay?

1068
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,640
You got everything,
and I got shit.

1069
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:27,000
Fucking Rapunzel, right?

1070
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:30,310
School would probably shut down
if you didn't show up!

1071
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:32,780
Queenie isn't here.

1072
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,450
I like those earrings, Claire.

1073
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,850
Shut up.

1074
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:39,360
- Are those real diamonds, Claire?
- Just shut up.

1075
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:41,420
I bet they are.

1076
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:45,660
- Did you work for the money for those?
- Shut your mouth.

1077
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,890
- Or did Daddy buy them for you?
- Shut up!

1078
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:51,130
I bet he bought those.

1079
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,970
I bet those were
a Christmas gift, right?

1080
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,030
Know what I got for Christmas?

1081
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:59,940
It was a banner-fucking-year
at the Bender family.

1082
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:01,950
I got a carton of cigarettes.

1083
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:04,180
The old man grabbed me and said,
"Smoke up, Johnny."

1084
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:08,650
go home and cry to your daddy.
Don't cry here, okay?

1085
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:24,440
Will we be like our parents?

1086
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:26,170
Not me...

1087
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,670
ever.

1088
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,410
It's unavoidable.

1089
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:37,680
Just happens.

1090
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:40,120
What happens?

1091
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,060
When you grow up...

1092
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:46,560
your heart dies.

1093
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:47,920
Who cares?

1094
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:51,050
I care.

1095
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:55,730
I was just thinking,
I mean...

1096
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:59,570
I know it's kind
of a weird time...

1097
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,570
but I was just
wondering, um...

1098
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:05,240
what will happen
on Monday?

1099
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:07,580
When we're all together again.

1100
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:10,620
I consider you guys my friends.

1101
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,750
Am I wrong?

1102
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,250
No.

1103
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:20,890
So on Monday, what happens?

1104
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:22,900
Still friends, you mean?

1105
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,260
If we're friends now?

1106
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:26,490
Yeah.

1107
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:29,020
Want the truth?

1108
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,500
Yeah, I want the truth.

1109
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:33,940
I don't think so.

1110
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,300
With all of us or just John?

1111
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:41,350
With all of you.

1112
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:45,320
- That's a real nice attitude, Claire.
- Oh, be honest, Andy.

1113
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:48,290
If Brian came up to you on Monday,
what would you do?

1114
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:52,760
Picture this.
You're there with all the sports.

1115
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:55,690
You know exactly what you'd do.
You'd say hi and when he left...

1116
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,320
you'd cut him up so your friends
wouldn't think you really liked him.

1117
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,760
No way.

1118
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,800
Okay. What if I came up to you?

1119
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:08,240
- The same exact thing.
- You are a bitch!

1120
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:12,140
Why? Because I'm telling
the truth, I'm a bitch?

1121
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,980
No! 'Cause you know how shitty
that is to do to someone.

1122
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:19,640
And you don't have the balls
to stand up to your friends.

1123
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,850
What about you, you hypocrite?

1124
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,320
Why don't you take Allison
to a heavy metal vomit party.

1125
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:30,260
Take Brian or Andy out to
the parking lot to get high. Or me?

1126
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:33,490
What would your friends say if we were
walking down the hall together?

1127
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,560
They'd laugh their asses off.

1128
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,330
You'd say we were doing it,
so they'd forgive you.

1129
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:43,370
Don't talk about my friends! You don't
know them. You don't look at them.

1130
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,440
And you certainly wouldn't
condescend to speak to them.

1131
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:50,880
Just stick to what you know: shopping,
nail polish, your father's BMW...

1132
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:54,150
- your drunk mother in the Caribbean--
- Shut up!

1133
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:58,680
As far as being concerned about us
walking down the hallways together.

1134
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,230
Forget it!
It'll never happen!

1135
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:03,630
Just bury your head
and wait for your fucking prom!

1136
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:06,760
- I hate you!
- Yeah? good!

1137
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:16,040
I assume Allison and I are
better people than you guys?

1138
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,900
Us weirdos?

1139
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:26,380
- Would you do that to me?
- I don't have any friends.

1140
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:32,020
- Well, if you did?
- No.

1141
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:36,920
I don't think my kind
of friends would mind.

1142
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:42,590
I just want to tell each of you
that I wouldn't do that.

1143
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,100
I wouldn't and I will not.

1144
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:49,730
Because I think that's real shitty.

1145
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:55,310
Your friends wouldn't mind
because they look up to us.

1146
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:01,780
You're so conceited, Claire.

1147
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,410
You're so conceited.

1148
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:06,790
You're so full of yourself. Why?

1149
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,020
I'm not saying that
to be conceited.

1150
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:14,000
I hate having to go along
with everything my friends say.

1151
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:16,160
Then why do you do it?

1152
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,600
I don't know. I don't--

1153
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:23,070
You don't understand.
You don't--

1154
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:27,340
You're not friends with the people
Andy and I are friends with.

1155
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:32,140
You don't understand the pressure
they can put on you.

1156
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:34,840
I don't understand what?

1157
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,620
You think I don't
understand pressure?

1158
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:39,210
Well, fuck you!

1159
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:41,160
Fuck you!

1160
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,470
You know why I'm here today?

1161
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,130
Do you?

1162
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,470
I'm here...because...

1163
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:05,610
Mr. Ryan found
a gun in my locker.

1164
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:13,160
- Why'd you have a gun?
- I tried.

1165
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:19,030
You pull the fucking trunk...

1166
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,230
and the light's supposed to go on.

1167
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,190
It didn't go on.
I mean, l--

1168
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:29,270
- What's the gun for?
- Just forget it.

1169
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:31,500
You brought it up, man.

1170
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:36,110
I can't have an "F."

1171
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:40,880
I can't have it...

1172
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,880
and I know
my parents can't have it.

1173
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:49,350
Even if I ace
the rest of the semester...

1174
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:53,370
I'm still only a "B."
Everything's ruined for me.

1175
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:55,920
Brian.

1176
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,710
Considering my options,
you know?

1177
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,250
- Killing yourself is not an option.
- I didn't do it, did l!

1178
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:10,150
No. I don't think so.

1179
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:12,280
It was a handgun?

1180
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:17,410
It was a flare gun.
Went off in my locker.

1181
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,720
Really?

1182
01:25:21,730 --> 01:25:23,560
It's not funny.

1183
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,100
Yes, it is.

1184
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,780
Fucking elephant was destroyed.

1185
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:49,480
Know what I did
to get in here?

1186
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:53,020
Nothing.

1187
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:56,690
I didn't have anything
better to do.

1188
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:04,430
You're laughing at me.

1189
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,730
No.

1190
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:07,470
Yeah, you are.

1191
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,590
It seems so clear in black and white

1192
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:38,360
The living color
tends to dull our sight

1193
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,770
Like dynamite

1194
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,540
Just imagine my surprise

1195
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:48,550
When I looked into your eyes and saw

1196
01:26:48,610 --> 01:26:50,610
Through your disguise

1197
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:54,390
If we dare expose our hearts

1198
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:56,890
And just reveal the purest thoughts

1199
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,890
And that is when
sensations start to grow

1200
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,230
We are not alone

1201
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,730
You find out
where you're coming from

1202
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:11,900
There'll be somebody there
to break your fall

1203
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:14,240
We are not alone

1204
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:16,570
'Cause when you
look out through the door

1205
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:20,980
We're really not
the victims after all

1206
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:54,710
Brian?

1207
01:27:54,780 --> 01:27:55,710
Hmm?

1208
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:58,220
Are you going to write your paper?

1209
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,770
Yeah. Why?

1210
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:05,880
It's a waste for all of us
to write our paper.

1211
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,150
Vernon wants us to.

1212
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:12,490
True, but I think
we'd all kinda say the same thing.

1213
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:17,160
You just don't want
to write your paper, right?

1214
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,230
True, but...

1215
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:21,070
you're the smartest, right?

1216
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:22,970
Well...

1217
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:26,470
We trust you.

1218
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,510
Yeah.

1219
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:34,340
All right.

1220
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:37,050
I'll do it.

1221
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:39,350
great.

1222
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:52,770
Come on.

1223
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,930
Where are we going?

1224
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:56,500
Come on.

1225
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,610
[ Claire ] Don't be afraid.

1226
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:04,210
Don't stick that in my eye.

1227
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:07,380
I'm not sticking it. Just--
go like that.

1228
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:11,720
- [ Claire ] good.
- [ Squealing ]

1229
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:17,420
You look better without all that
black shit on your eyes.

1230
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,020
Hey, I like that black shit.

1231
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,490
This looks a lot better.

1232
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:25,570
Look up.

1233
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:35,000
[ Snorting ] Please.

1234
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,110
Why are you being
so nice to me?

1235
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:39,850
'Cause you're letting me.

1236
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:50,020
[ Door Opening ]

1237
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:58,360
You lost?

1238
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,390
Thank you.

1239
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:02,220
Why'd you do that?

1240
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:04,790
'Cause I knew you wouldn't.

1241
01:31:06,610 --> 01:31:09,940
You said before your parents use you
to get back at each other.

1242
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:13,470
Wouldn't I be outstanding
in that capacity?

1243
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:19,080
Were you really disgusted about
what I did with my lipstick?

1244
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:20,910
Truth?

1245
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:23,410
Truth.

1246
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:25,650
No.

1247
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:37,130
What happened to you?

1248
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:40,860
Why? Claire did it.

1249
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,610
What's wrong?

1250
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:50,810
Nothing's wrong. It's just...

1251
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,540
just so different.

1252
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:57,050
I can see your face.

1253
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:59,520
Is that good or bad?

1254
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,550
That's good.

1255
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:18,900
See you, Brian.

1256
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:22,850
See you next Saturday.

1257
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:24,410
You bet.

1258
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:36,760
Won't you come see about me

1259
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:39,320
I'll be alone

1260
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,960
Dancing, you know it, baby

1261
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:45,730
Tell me your troubles and doubts

1262
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:50,240
giving me everything
inside and out and

1263
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:54,670
Love's strange
So real in the dark

1264
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:57,110
Think of the tender things

1265
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:59,480
That we were working on

1266
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:03,410
Slow change may pull us apart

1267
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:08,220
When the light gets
into your heart, baby

1268
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:10,820
Don't you

1269
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:14,100
Forget about me

1270
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:17,460
Don't, don't, don't, don't

1271
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:19,700
Don't you

1272
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:22,830
Forget about me

1273
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:29,680
Will you stand above me

1274
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:34,380
Look my way but never love me

1275
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:36,580
Rain keeps fallin'

1276
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:40,490
Rain keeps fallin' down

1277
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,820
Down, down

1278
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:47,360
Will you recognize me

1279
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:51,360
Call my name or walk on by

1280
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,200
As the rain keeps fallin'

1281
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:58,000
Rain keeps fallin' down

1282
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,510
Down, down

1283
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1284
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,350
[ Brian ]
Dear Mr. Vernon...

1285
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:14,090
We accept the fact
that we had to sacrifice...

1286
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:17,690
a whole Saturday in detention
for whatever it was we did wrong.

1287
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,170
We think you're crazy to make us
write an essay on who we think we are.

1288
01:34:22,230 --> 01:34:24,400
You see us as
you want to see us...

1289
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:28,130
in the simplest terms,
the most convenient definitions.

1290
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:30,200
But what we found out...

1291
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:32,270
is that each one of us
is a brain...

1292
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:36,340
- [ Andy ] and an athlete...
- [ Allison ] and a basket case...

1293
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:39,580
- [ Claire ] a princess...
- [ Bender ] and a criminal.

1294
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:42,050
[ Brian ]
Does that answer your question?

1295
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:44,580
Sincerely yours...

1296
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,390
the Breakfast Club.

1297
01:34:47,630 --> 01:34:50,060
Don't, don't, don't, don't

1298
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:52,730
Don't you

1299
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,630
Forget about me

1300
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:59,900
As you walk on by

1301
01:35:01,340 --> 01:35:04,500
Will you call my name

1302
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:08,980
As you walk on by

1303
01:35:10,150 --> 01:35:13,810
Will you call my name

1304
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:17,080
When you walk away

1305
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:41,780
When you walked into the room

1306
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:45,440
I could see you were no fool

1307
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:49,780
Is that smile a sight for me

1308
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:51,850
Only if my heart could see

1309
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:03,130
Will I make your body cry

1310
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:06,800
Cry so loud you never hear

1311
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:09,710
In the shadows of my life

1312
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:13,370
Can I take you home tonight

1313
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:24,980
Your heart too hot to hold

1314
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:28,990
Just a flame that burns my soul

1315
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:31,330
Heart too hot to hold

1316
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,160
Too hot, too hot

1317
01:36:33,230 --> 01:36:36,170
Too hot to hold

1318
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:39,430
Heart too hot to hold

1319
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:43,100
A flame that burns my soul
