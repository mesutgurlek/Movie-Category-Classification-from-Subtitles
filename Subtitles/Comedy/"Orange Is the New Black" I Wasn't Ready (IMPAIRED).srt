My zipper's broken.

342
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,110
First time down?

343
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,710
My first time here?

344
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,950
No. Your first time in prison.

345
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,980
Oh.

346
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,470
Yeah.

347
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,670
That's not so bad.

348
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,160
Everyone's okay.

349
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,160
You've gotta watch out for the stealing.

350
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,660
Eh, what's your name?

351
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,750
Eh, your last name. Everyone uses last names here.

352
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,610
I'm Morello and that is Watson.

353
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,070
Chapman.

354
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,190
Uh, how much time you got Chapman?

355
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,370
15 months.

356
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,200
Aw, that's not so bad.

357
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,630
I got 34.

358
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,580
But I'm hoping with good time there'll be less.

359
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,580
Y-You... So you're a...

360
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,990
They let you drive?

361
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,110
Well, who else is gonna do it?
[laughs]

362
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:09,460
We do everything around here.
[laughs]

363
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,320
Hey can I ask you somethin'?

364
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,100
You look like you'd know.

365
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,930
Alright. Which dress do you like better?

366
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,710
My top two favs are the ones where they have a half lid stuck to the paper.

367
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,690
See, I want something that's going to express my personality...

368
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,410
And its ricus. 

369
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,890
I wanna show off the boobs...

370
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,450
The ass... But I'm not so happy with the upper arms and stomach...

371
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,560
So. There's your challenge.

372
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,690
Both, nice.

373
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,150
That's all you've gotta say?

374
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,870
I've gotta look good.

375
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,870
My first dance is gonna go on Youtube.

376
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,680
Look!

377
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,030
I found a rock that looks like a penis with one ball.

378
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,430
No.

379
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,030
It's my Lance Armstrong rock.

380
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,720
[laughs]

381
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,380
Hold it up. Lemme see, lemme see.

382
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,750
Nice.

383
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,310
Okay, now lick it softly and tenderly like you would've when you thought he was clean.

384
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,030
-Oh, Jesus shut that thing off.
-You're making a huge mistake. This could go viral.

385
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,750
-Seriously. Shut it off.
-What?

386
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,240
I'm so fat from all the stress eating. I really don't want a record of it.

387
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,710
You know that's one thing I'm gonna do in prison.

388
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,110
I'm gonna get... ripped.

389
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,860
Like Jackie Warner ripped.

390
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,470
And I'm gonna read everything on my Amazon wishlist...

391
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,470
And maybe even learn to craft.

392
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,470
You know? I could be crafty.

393
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,880
I'm gonna make it count Larry.

394
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,970
I'm not gonna...

395
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,800
Throw away a year of...

396
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
My life... What the hell are you looking for?

397
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,780
[clears throat]

398
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,910
Oh no.

399
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,460
What is that?

400
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,430
Paper.

401
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,890
Oh Jesus Larry. Why would you want...

402
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,240
Why would I want a felonious...

403
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,020
Former lesbian...

404
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,650
WASP shiksa who's about to go to prision to marry me?

405
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,880
Yes. And all of the stress eating...

406
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,120
Well... because...

407
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,750
This... peculiar...

408
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,930
Underachieving...

409
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,820
Underemployed Jew boy...

410
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,960
Loves her.

411
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,430
And...

412
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,660
Knows that he will never be bored...

413
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,840
And...

414
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,560
Can't believe...

415
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,300
How lucky he is that he met her.

416
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,740
I gotta lock this shit down before you leave, Pipes.

417
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,810
I love you.

418
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,960
You wanna marry me?

419
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,960
When I get out, right?

420
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,450
Whenever you want.

421
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,320
I'll be so ripped.

422
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:31,380
[laughs]
I'll be so ripped.

423
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,460
[laughs]

424
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,440
You can wear a... wedding dress that's like a...

425
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,270
Like a half shirt, you know?

426
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,480
Show off those abs.

427
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,710
Yeah.
[laughs]

428
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,870
This for the grandmothers?

429
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,420
No, my mom's saving that one for my sister. This is my...

430
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,250
Great aunt Marcia's.

431
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,060
She had thyroid cancer and a series of Schnauzers...

432
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,430
All named Schnapps.

433
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,580
That's all I know.

434
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,760
Put it on.

435
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,240
I had it sized.

436
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,160
Good.

437
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,630
[sniffles]
-It's beautiful!

438
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,630
And that's a yes, right?

439
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,270
Yeah.

440
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,080
Will you say that o- just one more time for me?

441
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,910
And... This time...

442
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,570
Just lean to the camera for the photo.

443
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,750
Oh you asshole!
[laughs]

444
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,320
-Come on, I haven't captured the moment! What?
-Turn it off!

445
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,210
Give me that!
[laughs]

446
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,050
[kisses]
Oo, you're cold. Here.

447
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,800
Bounce your legs up and down. It keeps your feet warm.

448
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,950
Thanks.

449
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,610
You think your man is still gonna be around when you're out?

450
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,930
Yeah he'll be there.

451
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm the love of his life.

452
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,430
34 months is a long time.

453
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,660
Yeah, but she's the love of his life.

454
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,290
[scoffs]
And who the fuck asked you.

455
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,670
Head on out.

456
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,670
[doors slam shut]

457
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,280
Alright. So his tie is gonna match the bridesmaids' dresses

458
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,460
There's gonna be 6 bridesmaids. My cousin's being a bitch...

459
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,000
So I'm thinking about dropping her.

460
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,810
[doors squeak open]

Alright. Let's go.
[doors slam shut]

00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,140
Alright. Let's go.

[buzzer goes off, door unlatches]

469
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,660
Hello, Miss Claudette.

470
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,800
Morello.

471
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,380
You watch out for that one.

472
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
Don't get me wrong, she's a good lady.

473
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,450
But you don't wanna get on her bad side.

474
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,630
Go ahead. Go.

475
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,790
Okay, I gotta send you all to other processing. You've got your room assignments...

476
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:59,080
And I'll meet you back here, show you your bunks.

477
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,160
Okay?

478
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,860
Don't look so bummed. It'll give you wrinkles.

479
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,060
Alright. Raise your head and look at the lens.

480
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,930
Ah, crap.
[smacks table]

481
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,360
New guy.

482
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,130
What's your name? Bennett?

483
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,480
Bennett, it's not fucking working again.

484
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,950
-Did you turn it on?
-Yeah. I turned it on.

Wait I think I got it.

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,450
Ready?

488
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,280
Yeah. Yep.

Wait, no.

-What does this button do?
-No! Don't touch that.

492
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,550
Sorry, princess.

493
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,960
There's a cord right there. D-Do you think that that needs to be connected to something?

494
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,800
Shut your mouth and stand still.

00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,240
-She's right.
-Okay, fine.

497
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,790
[shutter sound]
Got it.

498
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,100
You... I wasn't ready.

499
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Tough shit. Next!

500
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,290
This is a TB test.

501
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,720
Nice veins.

502
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,210
No track marks!

503
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,120
Thanks.

504
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,270
Tattoos?

505
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,990
Oh, yeah.

506
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, fish. You like fish?

507
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,370
Saw it on a scuba diving trip.

Thought it was beautiful.

Mm. I don't like fish.

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,800
It's gonna rub off when I sweat.

00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,580
No, it won't. It's waterproof.

Stop.

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,330

Should be good to go.

Before heading on to her mid-range hotel to go over her schedules.

That's what they charged me with.

I carried a suitcase of money.

I'm telling you, surviving here...

844
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,230

845
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,530
Don't eat the pudding.

846
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,240
What's the perspective on the pudding?

847
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,710
It comes in big cans marked "Desert Storm".

848
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,630
Sometimes the kitchen has to scrape the mold off the top before they serve it.

Hey. Hi, sister.

This is Chapman.

Sister, as in nun?

Mmhm.

Yep, a killer nun.

Oh, now stop it.

She doesn't know you're joking.

857
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,720
She chained herself to a flagpole at a nuclear test site.

00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,110
Amen.

859

What's your story?

861
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,320
I chained myself to a drug dealer.

862

Piper.

863
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,760
Can't be taking advice from a nun and a hippy.

864

By all means.

865

I pray for you, Nicky.

Oh. I pray for you too, sister.

868

You should come to class, watch me chaturanga.

That whole common room smells like fart.

It kinda takes away the magic for me.

Or do you prefer pipes as your name suggests?

She's your mum?

Ah, maternal figurehead.

885
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,170
My actual mother lives in Brazil with her boyfriend, Paulo...

Who destroys rainforests and collects photos of realistic art.
