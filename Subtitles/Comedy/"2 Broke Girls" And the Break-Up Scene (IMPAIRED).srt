1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,507
Hi, ready to order?

2
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:04,425
Do you have anything
that's really special?

3
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:07,679
Not according to my
high school guidance counselor.

4
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:09,547
I'll have the veggie plate.

5
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:11,516
But instead of beets,
I want kale.

6
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:14,018
And instead of broccoli,
more kale.

7
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,020
I want the veggies steamed.

8
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:17,755
And instead of dressing,
I want lemons.

9
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:19,691
Don't you need
to write this down?

10
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,526
I'm afraid if I start
writing that down,

11
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:24,812
it'll turn into a suicide note.

12
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:26,231
I'm assuming
this table's gonna have

13
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:27,866
a lot more of those requests.

14
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:30,902
Yes, I could tell by the hats.

15
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:40,632
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

16
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:44,082
Earl, I have something new
I want you to try.

17
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:46,000
That's the exact same sentence

18
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:48,953
that got me hooked
on cocaine in the '80s.

19
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:51,389
It's my new cupcake flavor.

20
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:54,976
Delicious dark chocolate
the ladies can't help but love.

21
00:00:54,978 --> 00:00:57,178
I'm calling it
"The Earl."

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,064
I know you got that right.

23
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,316
Hi, I'm here.

24
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:03,467
I was running late
so I decided to hail a cab.

25
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:05,636
And then I remembered I didn't
have any money on me.

26
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:08,022
And then I remembered
I didn't have any money at all.

27
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:10,692
So I walked the whole way here.

28
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:12,944
The apartment's
three blocks away.

29
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:13,995
Yes, I know.

30
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:16,480
Three blocks
and 15 "Hola chicas" away.

31
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:19,033
Well, you can't be late again.

32
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:20,952
I'm already worried
about me being late...

33
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:23,154
every month.

34
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:26,207
On my way here, a homeless man
asked me for money.

35
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:28,626
And I told him
that I usually always give,

36
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:31,095
but that my father was indicted
in a Ponzi scandal

37
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:34,098
and I've lost my family fortune
and my Manhattan townhouse,

38
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,500
so I've been sleeping
on a couch in Brooklyn,

39
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:38,469
but, in spite of it all,
I'm still optimistic

40
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:40,221
that you and I
will achieve success

41
00:01:40,223 --> 00:01:43,007
in our exciting new cupcake
business venture.

42
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:45,476
And look what he gave me!

43
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:48,229
You took money
from a homeless man?

44
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:50,565
I prefer to think
of Bob near the bridge

45
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,150
as our first investor.

46
00:01:52,152 --> 00:01:55,036
Pickup!
Special sandwich.

47
00:01:55,038 --> 00:01:57,405
I can think
of even more special sandwich.

48
00:01:57,407 --> 00:02:02,043
You, me
and the hot blonde giraffe.

49
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:04,712
Well, she recently
lost her dignity,

50
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:06,347
so you might have a shot.

51
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:09,417
Hello today!

52
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,085
I have nametag for you.

53
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:14,055
Only your second day
and look, nametag already.

54
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:16,674
As new owner, I am killing it.

55
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:17,708
Thank you.

56
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,143
Oh, it says "Carolin."

57
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:21,095
It's Caroline.
With an "E."

58
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:22,880
I'm Caroline.

59
00:02:22,882 --> 00:02:25,400
As new owner, I am sucking it.

60
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:27,385
Just put it on.

61
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,070
You can't tell an Asian
he made a mistake.

62
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:32,040
He'll go in the back
and throw himself on a sword.

63
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,691
Thank you,
Mr. Lee.

64
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:35,076
You may call me Han.

65
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:36,694
H-a-n.

66
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:38,613
No trap in my name.

67
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:40,915
I'm thinking we should take

68
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,167
the first step
in our new cupcake business

69
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:45,236
by writing
"Max's Homemade Cupcakes"

70
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:46,571
up on the specials board.

71
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:48,239
No, I can't have
my name up there.

72
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,426
Everyone I owe money to
thinks I live in Seattle.

73
00:02:51,428 --> 00:02:55,680
Oh, we used to own Seattle.

74
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:57,932
Max, we've got to get
the name out there.

75
00:02:57,934 --> 00:02:58,966
Create a buzz.

76
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:00,051
Ooh, good idea!

77
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:00,968
Let's create a buzz.

78
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,236
Exactly,
in order to launch--

79
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:04,722
I'm mocking you.

80
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,607
When in doubt,
I'm always mocking you.

81
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,109
Seriously, Max.

82
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,478
This new cupcake business
is our lifeline.

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,230
A way out for both of us.

84
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:15,233
And I wanna thank you again
for letting me move in.

85
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:17,485
If there's anything
I can do to help you--

86
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:20,154
You mean besides
starting to wait on tables?

87
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:21,572
I meant, anything I can do

88
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:24,208
to help you through
your breakup with Robbie.

89
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,628
Oh. Thanks,
but I'm fine.

90
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,696
And we're working.

91
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:31,082
Well, one of us is.

92
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:32,934
Are you sure you're fine?

93
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:35,136
'Cause I heard you
crying last night.

94
00:03:35,138 --> 00:03:36,471
I don't cry.

95
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:40,975
I sold my tear ducts to an organ
bank for cash two years ago.

96
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:42,543
I was on the couch.

97
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:45,396
And I heard you crying alone
in your bedroom.

98
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:48,232
Really?
What did the crying sound like?

99
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:53,488
Like...
[Moaning]

100
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,357
I wasn't crying.

101
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:57,575
Well, then what
were you d--

102
00:03:57,577 --> 00:04:01,145
Oh! So none of
my business.

103
00:04:01,147 --> 00:04:03,614
That's right.
And remember that.

104
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:04,982
Got it.

105
00:04:04,984 --> 00:04:06,284
In fact, let's just say
that anything having to do

106
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:09,170
with my bedroom, my tables,
or my life--

107
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:10,254
you should stay away from.

108
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:11,655
Boundaries.
Got it.

109
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:15,326
And please
don't tell anyone at work

110
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:16,828
I let you move
into my apartment.

111
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,330
That is one boundary
we both don't want crossed.

112
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:21,299
Why?

113
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,301
Hey, roomies.

114
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:25,486
That's why.

115
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,265
Hope those sheets are okay.

116
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:34,507
Oh, don't worry about it.

117
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:36,042
I know they're the best
you could afford.

118
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:39,827
Not really.
The good ones are on my bed.

119
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:42,079
Max, that oven is so hot.

120
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,398
Could you do me a favor
and open the back door?

121
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,499
We've known each other two days

122
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,901
and you're already
asking for back door?

123
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:57,344
Dear God!

124
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:59,680
I forgot
you're Equestrian Barbie.

125
00:04:59,682 --> 00:05:02,366
You came with a horse.

126
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,185
No.

127
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:07,087
Out, horse, bad!
Bad horse.

128
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:12,977
Chestnut.
[Snaps]

129
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,363
No need to yell,
he's a champion.

130
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:18,315
Champion stink bomb.

131
00:05:18,317 --> 00:05:20,401
It's smelling pretty ripe
out in that yard.

132
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,537
That's not Chestnut,
that's Brooklyn.

133
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,939
Okay, well, I'm watching
"The Champion"

134
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:31,245
drop some steaming hot
"Brooklyn" right now.

135
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,365
Max, I've been thinking about
how you completely overreacted

136
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,383
to your name
up on the specials board.

137
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,419
Do you think it's
a fear of success?

138
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,972
I am too poor
to have a fear of success.

139
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,591
At Wharton Business School,
we learned

140
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,060
that every new venture can bring
up a certain amount of fear.

141
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:48,229
Is there any way
to do a yelp review

142
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,514
of Wharton Business School?

143
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,851
Maybe you're having
a hard time imagining

144
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,819
this cupcake business
could ever even happen

145
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:59,156
because nobody ever believed
in you or your dreams.

146
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,391
I'm guessing.

147
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,310
I can make this happen, Max.

148
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:05,646
For me, for you, for us.

149
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:07,781
Just keep making
those amazing cupcakes.

150
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:10,484
And I'll do the rest
till you believe.

151
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:11,952
I believe
everything you just said

152
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,172
and that children
are the future.

153
00:06:34,342 --> 00:06:36,427
Max, it's me!

154
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,513
I know it's you.

155
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:41,532
You sleep with a knife
under your pillow?

156
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:45,819
It's the only home security
system I can afford.

157
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:48,021
And I'm a cutter.

158
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:50,708
I can't sleep on that couch.

159
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,878
I think Ikea might be the
Scandinavian word for sciatica.

160
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,364
And there's weird sounds
in the street.

161
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:59,717
And I don't have
my white noise machine.

162
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,335
Well, that's
Puerto Rican noise.

163
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,536
You'll get used to it.

164
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:05,806
Can I just lay down here
and get a little sleep?

165
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:08,726
I don't even let the men
I sleep with sleep with me.

166
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,478
I can't get into
your issues right now.

167
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,514
I just need to sleep!

168
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:17,151
Fine, get in then.

169
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:18,686
What is that?

170
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,323
Potato chips.
I sleep-eat.

171
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:24,808
Cool ranch and bacon?

172
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,893
Dude, they're delicious.

173
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:28,996
Because of your breakup
with Robbie?

174
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:30,280
Just get in.

175
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:33,534
I have to be in the city
to babysit in five hours.

176
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,407
Oh, great,
you're like a nightlight.

177
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:45,179
You're so blonde.

178
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,881
Thank you.

179
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,016
[Door creaks]

180
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:53,604
Max, someone's
in the living room.

181
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,273
Max, someone's in the bedroom!

182
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,691
Robbie!

183
00:07:57,693 --> 00:07:59,493
What's up, babe?

184
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:01,195
Robbie, what are you
doing here?

185
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,596
We broke up.

186
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:04,565
Still?

187
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,450
Yes, still.
You hit on me.

188
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,202
And then she caught you
with someone else

189
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:09,603
in these very sheets.

190
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:12,489
Which I'm hoping she washed.

191
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:13,707
Oh, I get it.

192
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:16,377
You blew me off
'cause you like the ladies.

193
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:19,079
Which is cool.
I like the ladies, too.

194
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,715
And right now,
it's the two ladies I like.

195
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,717
Robbie, if I were
gonna go lesbian,

196
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:27,337
she would be the last "les"
I'd "bian."

197
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,972
Listen, babe--

198
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:30,123
You really hurt her.

199
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,225
Stop.

200
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:34,228
She sleep-eats trans fats
thanks to you.

201
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,296
Here, stuff all of these
in your mouth.

202
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:40,967
Got it, your thing.
I'll be quiet.

203
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,986
Robbie, this isn't cool at all.

204
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,138
Mm-mm.

205
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,307
Showing up here
after what you did?

206
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:49,142
You go, girl.

207
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:52,446
I have something to say to you
and you had better listen.

208
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,483
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.

209
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:59,820
What are you,
the relationship ghost?

210
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:01,288
Robbie, just go!

211
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,258
I can't say what I need to in
front of the relationship ghost.

212
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,093
I'll call you
to come get your stuff

213
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:07,211
and we can talk then.

214
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,495
Leave the key.

215
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:12,599
Straight up, Max,
you're breaking my heart.

216
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:15,719
You're the only woman
that I feel this way about.

217
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:21,975
Here.

218
00:09:21,977 --> 00:09:24,228
Ladies, I don't know
what's going on here,

219
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,448
but it would've been
a lot sexier if I was in it.

220
00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:32,786
Are you okay?

221
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,188
If you wanna talk, I'm here.

222
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,375
Can I get a hit off that?

223
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:47,534
You think these are good?

224
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:50,654
God, we're poor.

225
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,927
Morning!

226
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,545
It's a beautiful day.

227
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:02,166
These shades belong down.

228
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,268
From now on, think of me
as a vampire

229
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,020
without all
the annoying marketing.

230
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,272
Bad news.

231
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,858
A pipe broke in the street
so the water's off.

232
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,610
Good news, when I went out
to get us two coffees,

233
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:16,897
I spoke to Juan and Javier,
two city workers.

234
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,000
And they assured me the water'll
be on no later than 3:00.

235
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:21,451
I also stopped
at the health food store

236
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:23,237
and got us
a fresh-squeezed juice to split.

237
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,005
It's ginger-apple-strawberry.

238
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:26,239
That was the name of the hooker

239
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:29,543
who had this apartment
before me.

240
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:32,713
What is this?

241
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,131
From me.

242
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,350
It says "Thanks for letting me
sleep in your bed last night."

243
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:39,887
I prefer my usual cash
on the bedside table.

244
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,923
When I went
to the cute coffee place,

245
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:45,258
I spoke to the counter girl,
Nabulangi--

246
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,028
If someone named Nabulangi
is making an appearance

247
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,013
in the first sentence,
I have to sit down.

248
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:53,099
And she said
her manager'll be in at 11:00.

249
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:55,602
So I thought I'd chanel it up,

250
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:56,770
walk on over there,

251
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:59,439
introduce myself
and your fabulous cupcakes.

252
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:02,659
That's exactly what
I was gonna do.

253
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,412
I'm just gonna go say good-bye
to Chestnut and get going.

254
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,297
You know, having
only one cute outfit

255
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:12,736
takes hours off
getting dressed.

256
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:16,506
Oh. That is a lot
of fresh Brooklyn.

257
00:11:16,508 --> 00:11:17,958
Morning, Chestnut.

258
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,927
It's a beautiful--

259
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:24,130
No. Way.

[Whimpering]

261
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:38,862
Look, Chanel Number Two.

262
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,482
Tell me it's mud.

263
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,150
T-tell me it's mud.

264
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:46,670
It's mud?

265
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,088
What is that?

266
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,508
A carrot?

267
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,711
There's carrots in the mud?

268
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,851
There's no water.

269
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,220
Oh, get it off me, please.

270
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,221
Please do something.

271
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,356
Just get it off me,
get it off me.

272
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,391
Stop!

273
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,842
This is dry-clean only.

274
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:11,011
Max, please, please take me

275
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:14,064
somewhere they have
a hot shower, I beg of you.

276
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,517
Calm down, it's just mud.

277
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:17,034
Max, please--

278
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,620
[screams] Don't touch me!

279
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:26,818
Thank you so much
for taking me to shower

280
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,003
at your babysitting job.

281
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:29,854
Well, I didn't have
much of a choice.

282
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:32,290
You pulled the pillow knife
on me.

283
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:33,491
I'll just introduce myself
to your boss

284
00:12:33,493 --> 00:12:35,476
and tell her what happened.

285
00:12:35,478 --> 00:12:36,494
Look, I don't want Peach
to know you were here.

286
00:12:36,496 --> 00:12:38,613
This is a job.
Not a meet-and-greet.

287
00:12:38,615 --> 00:12:39,814
Got it.

288
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,333
You get in there, you
take a five-minute shower,

289
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:42,817
clean it up and go.

290
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:45,437
Fine, I'll hide in the hallway
till she's gone.

291
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,840
No need, just follow me in.
She never really looks at me.

292
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:50,175
Morning!

293
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:52,794
Hi, Max.

294
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:55,463
Go!

295
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:56,497
Hey, Peach.

296
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,383
Uh, hair and makeup.

297
00:12:58,385 --> 00:12:59,634
What's the big occasion?

298
00:12:59,636 --> 00:13:01,886
Pilates.

299
00:13:01,888 --> 00:13:04,005
Max, good news.

300
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:06,941
They found a way
to make diamonds more sparkly?

301
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,812
I got Brad and Angelina
a playdate

302
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:13,114
with another set of twins
in the building.

303
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:14,449
It starts in five minutes.

304
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:15,567
Cool, what are their names?

305
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:17,685
6B.

306
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:19,654
Bye-bye,
Brangelina.

307
00:13:19,656 --> 00:13:21,122
Mommy loves you.

308
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:23,208
Guys?
Before you leave,

309
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,459
stop at this one.

310
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:25,860
Angelina could
use a little help.

311
00:13:25,862 --> 00:13:28,880
Contour that neck,
she's a fatty.

312
00:13:28,882 --> 00:13:30,665
Peach, come on,
that's baby fat.

313
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,168
Still, kids can be cruel.

314
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,970
Don't you listen
to your mommy, Angelina.

315
00:13:35,972 --> 00:13:38,139
She never eats.

316
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:41,309
Oh, no, she doesn't.

317
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:44,696
Here it is.

318
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,181
Caroline with an "E."

319
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:48,382
I have your new
and correct nametag.

320
00:13:48,384 --> 00:13:49,768
Oh, thank you, Han.

321
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,720
Oh.

322
00:13:52,722 --> 00:13:54,939
I've seen something
I should not have.

323
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:58,559
I will just put correct nametag
here on counter.

324
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:03,031
So sorry, but many thank yous.

325
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:04,532
What are you doing?

326
00:14:04,534 --> 00:14:06,751
I know you said
you don't want it up there.

327
00:14:06,753 --> 00:14:08,736
But now that you see it...

328
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:10,422
How does it feel?

329
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:12,006
It feels like
you're not listening to me

330
00:14:12,008 --> 00:14:13,508
at this job or at my other job.

331
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,427
I said a five-minute shower
and get out.

332
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:17,011
Did you take a nap at Peach's?

333
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:18,596
The thread count
was calling to me.

334
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:21,382
Peach found blonde hairs
in her bed

335
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:23,351
and thought her husband
was cheating on her.

336
00:14:23,353 --> 00:14:26,137
Which he is,
but that's not the point.

337
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:28,807
You almost ruined
a perfectly happy fake marriage,

338
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,475
and there are
innocent children involved.

339
00:14:30,477 --> 00:14:32,977
Well, I have some good news.

340
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:34,596
Look, it's Nabulangi.

341
00:14:34,598 --> 00:14:36,614
I invited her in
to taste your amazing cupcakes.

342
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:39,234
And when she loves them,
we'll have an in at her bakery.

343
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:40,819
Come over and say hello.

344
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:43,104
No, I can't now. I wanna call
Robbie before we get too busy.

345
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:44,789
Tell him when to come over
and get his stuff.

346
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,990
Max, wait.

347
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:47,559
No, don't distract me.

348
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,210
I wanna sound cool and hot
and all like,

349
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:52,113
"You can't have me
anymore, sucka."

350
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:53,214
Max--

351
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:54,799
Robbie, it's me.

352
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,969
Classy burp
on your outgoing message.

353
00:14:57,971 --> 00:14:59,287
Max, I--

354
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,338
No.

355
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,223
I need you to come
get your stuff tomorrow.

356
00:15:02,225 --> 00:15:03,842
I don't know how
you've been surviving

357
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:07,011
without your chin-up bar
and Axe body spray.

358
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:07,979
Max, hang up.

359
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:10,431
I already called him.

360
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,484
You called Robbie?

361
00:15:12,486 --> 00:15:13,568
You've done so much for me.

362
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,403
I wanted to do
something for you, too.

363
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:16,905
So I called Robbie
and I had him come over,

364
00:15:16,907 --> 00:15:18,356
and I gave him his stuff.

365
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:20,608
Now you won't have to go through
with all that mess.

366
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,312
And I think you'd be pleased,
I really let him have it.

367
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:27,648
What is with you
and boundaries?

368
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,334
You're in my bed,
you're in my boss' bed,

369
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:30,785
and now you go and call Robbie?

370
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:32,587
You're like--
you're like your big-ass horse.

371
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:34,488
Charging in everywhere
you don't belong.

372
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,657
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

373
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,594
In spite of what you say
about the sounds I heard

374
00:15:39,596 --> 00:15:41,045
coming from your bedroom
the other night,

375
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:42,680
I know you're upset.

376
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:46,334
I was masturbating.

377
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:50,471
I love my job.

378
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:53,825
I need to see you
outside. Now.

379
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,860
Don't get involved with her.

380
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:57,845
She takes money
from the homeless.

381
00:15:57,847 --> 00:15:59,898
Not true, Bob's an investor.

382
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,115
Be right back.

383
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:04,319
Good cupcake, right?

384
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:08,823
Max, I don't know
how smart that was,

385
00:16:08,825 --> 00:16:11,459
blowing by our only potential
business contact.

386
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:14,829
You stole my breakup scene.

387
00:16:14,831 --> 00:16:16,714
The only remotely good thing
about breaking up with a guy

388
00:16:16,716 --> 00:16:18,699
is telling him how much better
you are than him

389
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:20,385
when you give him back
his stuff.

390
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,003
I don't know if you noticed,

391
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:23,888
but my entertainment budget
is pretty low

392
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,640
and I was really
looking forward to that.

393
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:28,176
And then you went and stole it.

394
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:29,727
But I guess
you couldn't help it,

395
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:32,530
'cause that's what you channings
do, you steal things.

396
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:35,233
Huh.

397
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:36,651
Interesting.

398
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:39,487
Okay, you wanted
a breakup scene?

399
00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:40,688
You're in one.

400
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,023
I'm breaking up with you.

401
00:16:42,025 --> 00:16:43,224
Oh, okay.

402
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:45,693
The cupcake business is over,
the dream is dead.

403
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:48,729
Oh, I'm sure Nabulangi
will be devastated.

404
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:51,416
I don't need you
or your cupcakes to survive.

405
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:52,617
I'll figure something else out.

406
00:16:52,619 --> 00:16:55,420
Because, aside from your
constant Wharton putdowns,

407
00:16:55,422 --> 00:16:56,838
I'm a business genius

408
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,706
and I will always land
on my feet.

409
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,008
Oh, really?

410
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,260
'Cause today you kind of
landed on your front.

411
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:03,962
We're done.

412
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:06,247
After work tonight,
I'll get my things and be gone.

413
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:08,600
Ooh, you gonna load up
your dream-filled wheelie bag

414
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:11,252
and ride away
on sir muds-a-lot?

415
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:14,138
Go ahead.
Be as negative as you want.

416
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,242
'Cause you're in charge
of your own future again.

417
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:19,125
Oh, joke's on you.
I don't have a future.

418
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:33,090
Max...

419
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,859
Are you up?

420
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,594
No.

421
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:39,246
Max, are you mad?

422
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:40,247
Yes.

423
00:17:40,249 --> 00:17:43,033
Are you up and mad?

424
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:45,503
No and yes.

425
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:47,955
Oh, your bed's so soft.

426
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:51,459
That's my boob.

427
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:54,929
I know I moved out,
but I came back.

428
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:57,414
I took the rest
of our dead dream money

429
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:00,434
and bought some cocktails
for myself and some people.

430
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:02,720
And myself.

431
00:18:02,722 --> 00:18:04,355
Did you bring me back
any of those?

432
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:06,640
'Cause I can't
listen to this sober.

433
00:18:06,642 --> 00:18:09,059
Max...

434
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:12,396
I have nothing.

435
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:15,232
I really need
the cupcake business.

436
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:18,435
I can be different.

437
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:19,687
No, you can't.

438
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:22,573
No, I can't.

439
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:26,160
But I can be better.

440
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:27,611
Please?

441
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:30,381
Please, let's do this.

442
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:32,583
I know you have
a fear of success.

443
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:36,286
You do, because no one
ever believed in your dreams.

444
00:18:36,288 --> 00:18:39,957
But I believe in your dreams.

445
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,976
We have a dream.

446
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:44,461
God, you are so drunk.

447
00:18:44,463 --> 00:18:48,399
So you probably
won't even remember this.

448
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:53,204
I'm sorry I said that stuff
about your father.

449
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:54,905
Did you hear me?

450
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:58,642
Max, are you up?

451
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:04,582
Hey, do you have any more
of those poor people chips?

452
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:08,819
What's up, hangover three?

453
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,087
Why are these up?

454
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:13,591
I thought we were vampires.

455
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:16,710
Here, I took the rest
of last night's cupcake money,

456
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:20,648
and brought you a coffee
and a fresh juice.

457
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,883
Which means that,
after two days in business,

458
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:26,303
we are $23 down
from where we were.

459
00:19:26,305 --> 00:19:29,890
So we're still building
our cupcake business?

460
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:31,108
Sure.

461
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,110
All we need is how much?

462
00:19:33,112 --> 00:19:35,646
$250,000.

463
00:19:35,648 --> 00:19:38,616
Which is awesome.

464
00:19:38,618 --> 00:19:41,902
Max, I'm sorry
I crossed all those boundaries.

465
00:19:41,904 --> 00:19:43,120
It's cool.

466
00:19:43,122 --> 00:19:45,072
Me and drunk Caroline
worked it all out.

467
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:47,074
In fact...

468
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:52,046
She signed this paper.

469
00:19:52,048 --> 00:19:55,983
"I, drunk Caroline,
am a..."

470
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:57,801
What's that word?

471
00:19:57,803 --> 00:20:00,804
Punk ass ho.

472
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:02,256
Thanks.

473
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:05,809
"I, drunk Caroline,
am a punk ass ho.

474
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:08,312
"I promise to keep
my big mouth shut,

475
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:11,232
"and replace all
of Max's poor people chips.

476
00:20:11,234 --> 00:20:17,220
I will no longer meddle
in her relation-chips."

477
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:20,574
You laughed about that
until you threw up.

478
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:21,859
Oh, and if you're wondering,

479
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:25,112
no, the puke stains
will not void this contract.

480
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,234
God!

481
00:20:31,236 --> 00:20:33,587
I forgot again
that we have a horse.

482
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:35,089
Max, get him out of here.

483
00:20:35,091 --> 00:20:37,319
He doesn't know I'm a waitress.

484
00:20:40,046 --> 00:20:41,089
