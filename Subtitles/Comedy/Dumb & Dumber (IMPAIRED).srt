00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,775
Excuse me.

3
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,370
Could you tell me how to get
to the medical school?

4
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,881
I'm supposed to be doing a lecture
in about 20 minutes,

5
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,780
and my driver's
a bit lost.

00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,650
( Austrian accent )
You go straight ahead,

7
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,985
and, uh, you make a left
over the bridge.

8
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,718
That's a lovely accent
you have.

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,662
- New Jersey?
- Austria.

10
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,427
Austria! Ha ha!
Well, then...

11
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,662
( Australian accent )
G'day, mate.

12
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,636
Let's put another
shrimp on the barbie.

13
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,767
Let's not.

14
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,246
Oh.

Walk away.
Go on. Go on.

There you--
very funny, rascal.

Very funny.
In your dreams.

Man: Harry, why haven't you
dropped those dogs off at the show yet?

00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,357
Uh, sir, I didn't
want to send them

to a performance
on an empty stomach, sir.

Whew.

61
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,326
Suck me sideways.

62
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,637
Hello.
How are you?

00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,907
( romantic pop music

Uh-uh-uh... uh...
uh-uh-uh...

65
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,880
I'll be out
in one minute.

66
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,113
( mumbles )

67
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,053
Ow.

68
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,035
( inhales )

69
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,038
( exhales )

70
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,713
Why are you going
to the airport?

71
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,615
Flying somewhere?

72
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,085
How'd you guess?

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,587
I saw your luggage.

74
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,589
Then when I noticed
the airline ticket,

75
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,591
I put two and two
together.

76
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,559
So where're you headed?

77
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,061
Aspen.

78
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,086
Mmm... California.

79
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,326
Beautiful.

80
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,902
Name's Christmas,
Lloyd Christmas.

81
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,133
I'm Mary Swanson.

82
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,143
This isn't my real job,
you know.

83
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,441
- No?
- Nope, my friend Harry and I

84
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,674
are saving up our money
to open our own pet store.

85
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,945
That's nice.

86
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,852
- I got worms.
- I beg your pardon?

87
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,051
That's what we're going to call it--
I Got Worms.

88
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,525
We're going to specialize
in selling worm farms,

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,892
you know,
like ant farms.

90
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,556
What's the matter?

91
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,863
A little tense
about the flight?

92
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,766
Something like that.

93
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,433
There's really nothing
to worry about, Mary.

94
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,704
Statistically,
they say you're more likely

95
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,643
to get killed
on the way to the airport,

96
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,112
you know, like in a head-on crash
or flying off a cliff

97
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,081
or getting trapped
under a gas truck--

98
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,050
That's the worst.
I have this cousin--

99
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,712
well, I had this cousin.

100
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,916
Lloyd, could you keep
your eyes on the road, please?

101
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,923
Oh. Yeah.

102
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,721
Good thinking.

103
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,591
Can't be too careful.

104
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,858
A lot of bad drivers
out there.

105
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,161
( tires screeching )

106
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,169
Hey, watch it!

107
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,341
( dogs whimpering )

108
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,010
( tires screech )

109
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,845
Okay, gang,
you know the rules--

110
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,010
no humping, no pushing,
no sniffing heinies.

111
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:30,512
Where have you been? My dogs were
supposed to be here 40 minutes ago!

112
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,524
Now I hardly have any time
to primp them.

113
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,822
Don't worry about a thing,
Mrs. Neugy-burger.

114
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,658
- Neugeboren!
- Neug-neug-neug--

115
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,129
- Boren!
- Boren.

116
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:40,098
These pooches aren't going to
need any primping.

117
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,760
You know why?
I'll tell you why.

118
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,065
Because I bathed them
and I clipped them myself.

119
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,867
And I stand by
my performance.

120
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,971
( whimpering )

121
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,780
You know,
on second thought,

122
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,082
you might just want to run
a comb through 'em.

Thanks.
Here you go.

128
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,066
Oh no, Mary.

129
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,433
I couldn't possibly
accept that,

130
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,870
not after all
we've been through.

131
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,575
Thank you, Lloyd.

132
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,977
- Uh, good luck with your worms.
- Yeah.

133
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,914
Hey.

134
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,914
How about a hug?

Oh.

139
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,197
I hate goodbyes.
( chuckles )

140
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,796
Oh.

( groans )

142
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,469
Uh, Lloyd--

143
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,674
Shh!

144
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,706
( whispers )
Just go.

146
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,366

Be strong.

please pick up

150

Mr. Dan Mitchell, please pick up
the white courtesy phone...

151
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:54,130
She's gonna leave the briefcase
near the escalator.

152
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,795
- You make the pickup.
- Piece of cake.

Passenger Maura Tadge,

157
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,584
please pick up
the white courtesy phone.

158
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,118
You have a message.

( yells )
Agh! Mary!

161
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,039
Man :
There 's our payday.

162
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,103
She left it.
Let's go.

163
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,446
Lloyd : Excuse me!
Coming through!

164
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,849
Move it or lose it,
sister!

165
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,193
Hey!

166
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,220
( panting )

167
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,697
Eenie...

168
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,132
meenie... minie...

169
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,466
mo!

170
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,211
Hold that plane!

171
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,907
Sir, you can't
go in there!

172
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,210
It's okay!

173
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,410
I'm a limo driver!

174
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:26,323
- Agh!
- ( thuds )

175
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,884
Whew...

176
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,091
( moaning )

177
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,425
( tires screech )

178
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:42,373
( sirens blaring
in distance )

179
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,242
Hi, Lloyd.

180
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,908
Hi, Harry.

181
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,783
- How was your day?
- Not bad.

182
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,185
Fell off
the jetway again.

183
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,252
Who the hell you figure

184
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,195
this guy's
working for, anyway?

185
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,290
I don't know.

186
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,295
We sure as hell
better find out.

187
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,802
The ulcer?

188
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,811
I'll live.

189
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,279
( bird chirping )

190
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,949
- So you got fired again, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

191
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,324
They always freak out when you leave
the scene of an accident, you know?

192
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,162
Yeah, well,
I lost my job too.

193
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,999
Man! You are
one pathetic loser.

194
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,971
( laughing )
No offense.

195
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,201
No. None taken.

196
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,301
Ha ha ha!

197
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,337
You know what really
chaffs my ass, though?

198
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,179
I spent my life's savings

199
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,014
turning my van
into a dog.

200
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,043
Hi, Petey!

201
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,449
The alarm alone
cost me 200.

202
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,481
Hey!
Chicks love it.

203
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,516
It's a shaggin' wagon.

204
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,791
What's with
the briefcase?

205
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,330
It's a love memento.

206
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,166
The most beautiful
woman alive,

207
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,503
I drove her
to the airport.

208
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,509
Sparks flew,
emotions ran high.

209
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:26,977
She actually
talked to me, man.

210
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,139
Get outta here.

211
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,173
Oh, yeah yeah.
Tractor beam--

212
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,483
( humming whistle )
sucked me right in.

213
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:38,490
Anyway...
( inhales deeply )

214
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,492
she left this
in the terminal

215
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,188
and flew to Aspen
and out of my life.

216
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,254
What's in it?

217
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,632
Man... I would
have to be a lowlife

218
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:53,035
to go rootin' around in somebody else's
private property.

219
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,439
- Is it locked?
- Yeah, really well.

220
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,205
( knock on door )

221
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,949
Harry: There's two of them.
One of them's got a gun.

222
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,887
Did you pay
the gas bill?

223
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,222
Hey--

224
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,558
( whispering )
Do you realize what you've done?

225
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,529
I'm sorry.
I say we bail.

226
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,794
Okay.

227
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,334
- ( slams )
- Briefcase ain't here.

228
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,072
They must have
taken it with them.

229
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,080
Well, he's got to
come home sometime.

230
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,604
Maybe we should
trash the place,

231
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,742
send him
a little message.

232
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,686
I don't think he's going to get
that message, Joe.

233
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,053
I mean, the guy's got worms
in his living room.

234
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,251
Well.

235
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,761
Oh, I got
a better idea.

236
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,328
"l tought I taw
a puddy cat.

237
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,130
I did. I did."

238
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,693
( squawks )

239
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,740
( cracking )

240
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,109
I can't believe
we drove around all day

241
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,987
and there's not
a single job in this town.

242
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,150
There is nothing,
nada, zip!

243
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,990
Yeah, unless you want
to work 40 hours a week.

244
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,461
Pfft!

245
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,623
Here. I'm going to
go to the store.

246
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,530
Okay, just get
the bare essentials.

247
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,364
This is the last
of our dough.

248
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,996
Hey. What do l
look like?

249
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,769
# Take a little walk
to the edge of town #

250
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,539
# Go across the tracks #

251
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,174
# Where the viaduct looms #

252
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,149
# Like a bird of doom #

253
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,745
# As it shifts
and cracks #

254
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:53,349
# Where secrets lie
in the border fires #

255
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,360
# In the humming wires #

256
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,557
# Hey, man, you know
you're never coming back #

257
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,497
# Past the square,
past the bridge... #

258
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,295
# Past the mills,
past the stack... #

259
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,824
( grunting )

260
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,767
# On a gathering storm #

261
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,467
# Comes a tall
handsome man... #

262
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,305
Cripes!

263
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,369
# In a dusty black coat
with a red right hand. #

264
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,347
Excuse me,
little old lady.

265
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,412
( tires screech )

266
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,159
Uh, do you have
change for a dollar?

267
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,718
Change?

268
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,628
No, I'm sorry.
I don't.

269
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,690
Oh... well, uh,

270
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,702
could you do me a favor
and watch my stuff here

271
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,465
while I go
break a dollar?

272
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,837
- Of course.
- Thanks.

273
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,071
Hey. I guess
they're right.

274
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,668
Senior citizens,

275
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,237
although slow and dangerous
behind the wheel,

276
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,114
can still serve
a purpose.

277
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:55,416
I'll be right back.
Don't you go dying on me!

278
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,617
- Ugh!
- Where's the booze?

279
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,495
I got robbed
by a sweet old lady

280
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,092
on a motorized cart.

281
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,295
I didn't even
see it coming.

282
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,100
Oh...

283
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,129
- Harry?
- No...

284
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,404
- No...
- Harry. Come on, Harry.

285
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,172
Cheer up.

286
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,270
It gets worse, Lloyd.

287
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,247
My parakeet Petey...

288
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,342
- Yeah?
-...he's dead.

289
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,183
( gasps )

290
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,779
Aw...

291
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,757
Oh, man.
I'm sorry, Harry.

292
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,782
What happened?

293
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,796
His head fell off.

294
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,730
His head fell off?

295
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,131
Yeah, he was pretty old.

296
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,802
Ugh!

297
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,773
That's it.

298
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,275
I've had it
with this dump!

299
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,245
We got no food.
We got no jobs.

300
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,248
( yells )
Our pets' heads are falling off!

301
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,216
Okay, just calm down!

302
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,582
What the hell are we
doing here, Harry?

303
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,746
We gotta get
out of this town!

304
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,348
Yeah? And go where?
Where are we gonna go?

305
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,258
I'll tell you where,

306
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,193
someplace warm...

307
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,527
a place where the beer
flows like wine,

308
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,657
where beautiful women
instinctively flock

309
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,998
Iike the salmon
of Capistrano.

310
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,634
I'm talking about
a little place called...

311
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,402
Aspen.

312
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,605
I don't know, Lloyd.
The French are assholes.

313
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,079
Wait a minute.

314
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,648
Wait a minute!
I know what you're up to, mister.

315
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,381
Yeah! You just
wanna go to Aspen

316
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,856
and find that girl
who lost her briefcase,

317
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,257
and you need me
to drive you there!

318
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,659
- Right? Am I right?
- Yeah. So?

319
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:47,096
- Am I right? Am I right?
- Yeah! So?

320
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,396
So I wanna go someplace
where we know somebody

321
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,403
who can plug us into
the social pipeline.

322
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,735
No! No no no!
No, Lloyd!

323
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,570
No! I say we stay here,
we hunt for jobs,

324
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,202
and we keep saving our money
for the worm store!

325
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,508
I don't know about you,

326
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,208
but I am getting
sick and tired

327
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,715
of-of running
from creditors!

328
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,379
You know what I'm sick
and tired of, Harry?

329
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,884
I'm sick and tired of having to
eke my way through life.

330
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,458
I'm sick and tired
of being a nobody.

331
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,894
But most of all...

332
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,404
I'm sick and tired
of having nobody.

333
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,706
( soft piano music
playing )

334
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,770
Okay, Lloyd.

335
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,612
Aspen it is.

336
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,248
You'd better not
be foolin'.

337
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,089
( chuckles )

338
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,261
( crying )

339
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,267
Okay okay,

340
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,326
just let it out.
Have a good cry.

341
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,338
Come on.

342
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,169
Okay.

343
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,675
( sobbing )

344
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,812
Okay, that's enough.

345
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,215
# I never met a girl #

346
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,348
# Who made me feel
the way that you do #

347
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,551
# You're all right #

348
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:23,527
# Whenever I'm asked
who makes my dreams real #

349
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:27,498
# I tell them you do,
you're outta sight #

350
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,696
# I'm bringin ' you
a love that's true #

351
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:34,797
# So get ready,
get ready #

352
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,468
# I'm gonna try
to make you love me too #

353
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:42,242
# So get ready, get ready,
here I come #

354
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,442
# Get ready
'cause here I come... #

355
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,348
Lloyd,
what are you doing?

356
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,580
It feels like you're running
at an incredible rate, Harry.

357
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,747
Would you quit it?
We're not even through Connecticut yet,

358
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:51,983
and already
you're annoying me.

359
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,515
- Sorry.
- Jeez.

360
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,757
- We're really doing it, aren't we?
- Yeah.

361
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:00,391
Hey, where'd
you get those?

362
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,868
I bought them
when we filled up.

363
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,927
Well-- ( stutters )
we're supposed to talk

364
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,734
about all
expenditures, Lloyd.

365
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,604
We're on a very
tight budget.

366
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,871
This didn't come out
of our travel fund.

367
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,377
Oh.

368
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,312
No, I was able to raise
25 extra bucks

369
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,713
before we left.

370
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,979
Where did you get
25 extra bucks?

371
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:23,249
I sold some stuff
to Billy in 4C.

372
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,688
The blind kid?

373
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,817
Yeah!

374
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,554
Yeah.

375
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,029
What did you
sell him, Lloyd?

376
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,395
Stuff.

377
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,892
- What kind of stuff?
- I don't know.

378
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,030
A few baseball cards,
a sack of marbles...

379
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,234
( coughs )
Petey.

380
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,744
Petey?

381
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,679
You sold my dead bird
to a blind kid?

382
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,878
Lloyd, that-that--
what are you--

383
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,409
Petey didn't even
have a head!

384
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,787
Harry,
I took care of it.

385
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,528
Pretty bird.

386
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,359
Yeah. Can you say,
"pretty bird"?

387
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,955
Pretty bird.

388
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,627
Yes, pretty bird.

389
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,761
Pretty bird.

390
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,098
Polly want a cracker?

391
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,439
Those rat bastards.

392
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,608
They're rubbing it
right in our faces.

393
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,641
Man, Andre'll have
a goddamn hemorrhage

394
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,482
if we don't get
that briefcase back.

395
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,545
They must have been
following us for weeks.

396
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,786
- Why you say?
- "Gas Man."

397
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,487
How the hell do
they know that I got gas?

398
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,621
They gotta be pros.

399
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,762
Don't worry.
We're going to get that money back.

400
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,463
And I'll tell you
something else,

401
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,496
they ain't never
getting to Aspen.

402
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,804
I'm going to see to that.

403
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,439
Lloyd:
They got The Monkees.

404
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,542
They were a major influence
on The Beatles.

405
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,883
Yeah, I know.

406
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,081
Excuse me, Flo?

407
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,649
( both laughing )

408
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,165
Flo, like the TV show.

409
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:21,673
Uh... what is
the "soup du jour"?

410
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,368
It's the soup of the day.

411
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,069
Mm-hmm...

412
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,237
That sounds good.
I'll have that.

413
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:30,811
Anything else
before I leave the area?

414
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,612
No-- yeah--

415
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,516
yes yes,
my soda's flat.

416
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,851
It doesn't have
any bubbles.

417
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:45,825
Happy now?

418
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,866
Feels good to mingle
with these laid-back country folk,

419
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,965
don't it, Harr?
I like it a lot.

420
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,671
- Uh-oh.
- What? What's the matter?

421
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,745
( blows )

422
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,513
You spilled the salt,
that's what's the matter.

423
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,578
Spilling the salt
is very bad luck.

424
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,647
We're driving
across the country.

425
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,852
The last thing we need
is bad luck.

426
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,385
Quick. Toss some salt
over your right shoulder.

427
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,699
( thumps )

428
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,193
Uh-oh, too little
too late, Harry.

429
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,472
Who's the dead man
that hit me with the salt shaker?

430
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,878
( crowd murmuring )

431
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,109
( humming )

432
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,488
Harry:
Well... uh...

433
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,048
it was a terrible
mistake, sir.

434
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,492
Please, believe me.
I would never do anything

435
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,052
to offend a man
of your size.

436
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,360
Kick his ass,
Sea Bass!

437
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,025
You gonna eat that?

438
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,764
What? That?
No-- yes-- no.

439
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,796
Well... no,
it crossed my mind.

440
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,899
Yeah.

441
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,343
( snorts, hawks )

442
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,752
Still want it?

443
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,783
Nah, you go ahead.

444
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,196
You really
wimped out, man.

445
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,227
What are you talking about,
wimped out?

446
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:36,240
Well-well, did you--
the guy hawked on my burger!

447
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,504
Hey, wait a second.

448
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,807
I think I just...

449
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,838
Yeah...
I just had an idea.

450
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,416
Follow me.

451
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,250
Whew.

452
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,093
Lloyd:
Excuse me. Guys?

453
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,825
What the hell
do you want?

454
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:04,233
Uh... I just want
to apologize

455
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,066
for that uh...
unpleasant scene

456
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,799
a little earlier.

457
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,240
My friend Harry and l
would, uh...

458
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,608
Iike to buy
you guys a...

459
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,636
round of beers...

460
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,580
just to bury
the hatchet.

461
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,846
Make it
four boilermakers.

462
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,785
Whatever you want, sir.

463
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,812
I'll have the waitress
bring it over immediately.

464
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,622
- Lloyd, what are you doing?
- ( shushing )

465
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,821
We can't afford
to buy them drinks.

466
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,893
Um... excuse me.

467
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:39,802
Sea Bass and the fellas
offered to pick up our check.

468
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,363
They said just put it
on their tab.

469
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,232
They're very nice.

470
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,235
Sea Bass said that?

471
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,680
Well, if uh...

472
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,445
that guy at the table
over there is Sea Bass.

473
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,086
Ah! Uh.

474
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,788
All right,
if that's what he wants.

475
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,764
Put these
on there too, okay?

476
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,164
You got it.

477
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,136
I'm gonna kill
those sons of bitches!

478
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:18,243
( both laugh )

479
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,179
( both laugh )

480
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,738
That was genius, Lloyd,
sheer genius!

481
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,115
I mean, where did you come up
with a scam like that?

482
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:30,918
- Saw it in a movie once.
- That was incredible!

483
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:33,390
So what happened?
So the guy tricks some sucker

484
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,326
into picking up his tab,
then gets away with it scot-free?

485
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,990
No, in the movie, they catch up to him
a half-mile down the road

486
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:43,228
and slit his throat.
It was a good one!

487
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,133
( laughing )

488
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,162
Wow.
( grunts )

489
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:51,107
- Harry?
- What?

490
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,076
I know this isn't
the best time, but...

491
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,341
- when you get a chance to pull over...
- Yeah?

492
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,109
- I gotta pee.
- What, are you crazy?

493
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,775
I'm not pulling over now.

494
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,785
But I gotta go!
What am I supposed to do?

495
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,050
Well-well, whiz in one of the empty beer
bottles in the back.

496
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,717
They're on the floor.
Just get one of--

497
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:09,249
- Jeez, Lloyd!
- Quit moving around!

498
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,853
Huh! What--

499
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,864
Shit!

500
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,093
( unzips pants )

501
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,863
- Watch the seat! Watch the seat!
- Okay!

502
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,639
All right!

503
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,607
( trickling )

504
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,008
Ahh...

505
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,775
Ahh...

506
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,806
- Uh-oh.
- What? What's wrong?

507
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,183
The bottle's almost full
and I'm still going.

508
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,189
- So stop going.
- I can't stop going once I've started.

509
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,157
It stings.

510
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,715
Quick! Get me
another bottle.

511
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,988
- What?
- Come on.

512
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,655
Hurry hurry hurry
hurry hurry hurry!

513
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,254
Come on! Come on!

514
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,629
Okay okay, here
here here. Hold it!

515
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:56,073
- Hold that.
- Jesus.

516
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,943
Hold that one.

517
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,710
Hurry.
I'm pinching it.

518
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,683
What are you,
a camel?

519
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,710
( sighs )

520
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:13,952
- ( siren blaring )
- Pull over!

521
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,559
- Huh?
- Pull over!

522
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,793
No, it's a cardigan,
but thanks for noticing.

523
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,861
Yeah.
Killer boots, man!

524
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,568
Pull your vehicle
to the side of the road!

525
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,580
License and registration,
please.

526
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,257
You fellas were going a little fast back
there, wouldn't you say?

527
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,890
You, uh...
you fellas been doing

528
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,762
a bit of boozing,
have you?

529
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,427
Sucking back on Grandpa's
old cough medicine?

530
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,800
No. Oh no, sir.

531
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,202
- No no no.
- No, huh-uh.

532
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,139
Yeah, well,
what's that?

533
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,243
- That's nothing, sir.
- Yeah, nothing.

534
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,338
Yeah well, you aware that
it's against the law

535
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,178
to have an open
alcohol container

536
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,048
here in the State
of Pennsylvania?

537
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,450
Come on,
give me that booze,

538
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,819
you little pumpkin-pie-
haircutted freak!

539
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,517
Come on!

540
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,096
Sir, no, l-l--

541
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,761
No, sir, don 't.
Don 't drink--

542
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,360
You'd keep
your mouth shut

543
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,564
if you knew what was
good for you, buddy.

544
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,187
Harry:
Tic Tac, sir?

545
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,316
Get the hell
outta here!

546
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,923
( coughs, retches )

547
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,865
Mary: How could they not
have gotten the ransom?

548
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,493
It just doesn't
make sense.

549
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,528
I left the money exactly where they
instructed me to.

550
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,335
Woman : Oh, it makes
perfect sense, Mary.

551
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,205
We should have called
the authorities

552
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,039
the minute we knew
that Bobby was kidnapped.

553
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,908
Now, Helen, we've been
through this already.

554
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,881
- Mr. Andre.
- Nicholas.

555
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,215
- Karl.
- Nick Nick Nick.

556
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,879
Any word yet, sir?

557
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,889
No, nothing yet,
Nicholas.

558
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,891
( sighs )

559
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,893
I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

560
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,986
Maybe we should cancel

561
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:33,088
the preservation benefit
this weekend.

562
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,996
It would be so easy
to reschedule it.

563
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,467
No, I don't think we should do anything
out of the ordinary.

564
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,528
Yeah, she's right. It's imperative that we
carry on as usual...

565
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,267
- Okay.
-...especially you, Mary.

566
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,036
What am l
supposed to do,

567
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,270
just go about my life
like everything is fine?

568
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,142
That's exactly
what you should do.

569
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,306
Yes, go skiing, go to parties,
act normally, you know.

570
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,940
Yeah, don't you see,
honey?

571
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,848
We can't let on
that anything's wrong.

572
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,080
If the press or the authorities
get wind of this,

573
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,553
the kidnappers
may panic.

574
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,114
Mm. I mean,
you never know

575
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,126
what they might
do to him then.

576
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,596
( snoring )

577
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,210
# I saw her sitting
in the rain #

578
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:26,177
# Raindrops
falling on her #

579
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,310
# She didn't seem to care #

580
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:32,847
# She sat there
and smiled at me #

581
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,452
- # Then I knew #
- # I knew, I knew, I knew, I knew #

582
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:40,260
- # She could make me happy #
- # Happy happy #

583
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:42,061
# She could make me
very happy... #

584
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,433
# Flowers in her hair #

585
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,930
# Flowers everywhere #

586
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,169
# I love
the flower-girl #

587
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,041
# Oh, I don 't know
just why #

588
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,410
# She simply
caught my eye #

589
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,314
# I love
the flower-girl... #

590
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,215
So he says,
" Do you love me?"

591
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,278
and she says, " No, but that's
a real nice ski mask."

592
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,722
( all laughing )

593
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,896
Hey, man,
what's that?

594
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,915
( passes gas )

595
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,223
# I knew I had to
say hello #

596
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,524
# Hello hello #

597
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:49,260
# She smiled up at me #

598
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,995
# And she took my hand #

599
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,436
# And we walked through
the park alone #

600
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,236
# And I knew #

601
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:58,970
# I knew, I knew,
I knew, I knew #

602
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,443
# She had made me
happy... #

603
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,446
Whoo!

604
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,539
# Happy happy,
she had made me very happy #

605
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,244
- # Flowers in her hair... #
- ( cracks )

606
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,019
- ( bell rings )
- ( roaring )

607
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,792
( crunches )

608
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,766
( yelling )

609
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,675
( movements swishing )

610
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:38,546
( high-pitched
battle-cries )

611
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,616
( trills )

612
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:45,555
( gurgling )

( vocalizes )

616
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,479
Ahh...

617
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,490
eh?

618
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,726
Aah!

619
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,421
Aah!

620
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:27,761
( heartbeat thumping )

621
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:40,543
- # Suddenly, the sun broke through #
- # See the sun #

- # I turned around, she was gone #
- # Where did she go? #

623
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,446
( grunting )

624
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,418
( moaning )

625
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,553
Oh! Oh!

626
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,422
( groaning )

# Or just a dream
to me? #

( backfire )

638
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,622
You want me
to drive?

639
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,133
No, I'm cool.

640
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,037
( water bubbling )

641
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,603
Yeah!

642
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,128
Get her!

643
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,338
( chuckles )

644

- Ohh.
- ( thuds, water splashes )

645
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,872
( sighs )

646
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:25,246
This is the life--

647
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,150
cold beer, a hot tub
and paper-thin walls.

648
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,848
( laughs )

649
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,857
There's only one thing that could make this
moment any better.

650
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,552
What's that?

651
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,493
If you had a nice set
of knockers.

652
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,326
( laughs )
That's two things, Lloyd.

653
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,299
Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're not
stacked, Harry,

654
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,801
or I'd be banging you
right now.

655
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,735
( both laugh )

656
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,864
I'd show you what
a real man can do.

657
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,501
Split you like an
old piece of firewood.

658
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,479
You'd probably like it too,
you big homo.

659
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,211
Shut up.

660
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,448
Don't tell me
to shut up, woman.

661
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,518
( chuckles )

662
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,526
I don't know, Lloyd.
You know,

663
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,396
this place doesn't
really do it for me.

664
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,561
It brings back
a lot of memories.

665
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,333
Pour quoi?

666
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,899
It was a few years ago.

667
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,706
What happened, Harry?
Some little filly break your heart?

668
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,337
No, it was a girl.

669
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,870
- Oh.
- Fraida Felcher.

670
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,281
Yeah, we stayed in a place
just like this.

671
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,717
Wasn't this classy,
but, you know, nice.

672
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,654
Felcher?
From Cranston?

673
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:39,986
Yeah.
You know her?

674
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,821
Oh, yeah!

675
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,384
I mean,
I remember you...

676
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,794
talking about her.

677
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:51,268
We had the most incredibly
romantic time.

678
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,395
I thought we were gonna be
together forever,

679
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,735
and then about a week later,
right out of the blue,

680
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,434
she sends me
a John Deere letter.

681
00:37:57,475 --> 00:38:00,569
- She give you any reason?
- Yeah, I called her up.

682
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,306
She gave me
a bunch of crap

683
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,678
about me not listening to her
enough or something.

684
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,615
I don't know.
I wasn't really paying attention.

685
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,585
But the thing
that hurt the most

686
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,247
is I think she was
seeing another guy.

687
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,857
Never did
find out who.

688
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,790
( vacuum whirring )

689
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:43,447
Mental: Mr. Andre, guess who
we just happened upon?

690
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,547
- Yeah.
- Man: I had plans.

691
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,455
- Things I wanted to do.
- Yeah.

692
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,517
This is where it all ends--
at a phone booth.

693
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,392
- ( man muttering )
- Yeah. The boys are holed up

694
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,295
in a little love-nest
for the night.

695
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,028
I think they're
a little bit strange.

696
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,662
What the hell are
these guys up to?

697
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,934
I mean, is it possible
that they could be feds?

698
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,600
Highly unlikely
from what I've seen.

699
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,633
Sir, did you
ever hear

700
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,612
of the concept
of other people?

701
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:13,640
Um... me being that
for the phone,

702
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,946
sir.

703
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,681
Oh, you turned
your back on me.

704
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:20,088
Ho ho ho!
He got me mad. I almost like it.

705
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:22,319
You and Shay were
supposed to grab that bag

706
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,487
- so we could end this shit!
- Here's your drink, baby.

707
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,964
Do you know the damage
I could do to you?

708
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:31,593
Hold on a minute.

709
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,728
Hmm.

710
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,500
But that's not
your problem.

711
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,473
You didn't know.

712
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,204
Get off
the phone.

713
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,708
Get off the pho--

714
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,984
I'm sorry, Mr. Andre.
You were saying?

715
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,955
Look, Mental,

716
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,652
these jokers have got a lot of money
and it belongs to me!

717
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,594
Now, I want to know who they are
and what they're doing with it!

718
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,826
Hey hey hey, I told you already.
I'm on it.

719
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:05,063
- All right?
- Good.

720
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:08,739
Harry:
According to the map,

721
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,104
Harry:
According to the map,

722
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,768
we've only gone
about four inches.

723
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,504
You know,
I don't think

724
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,977
we have enough
gas money.

725
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:18,470
Relax. We have
more than enough.

726
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,484
I think
you're wrong, Lloyd.

727
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:21,815
How much
you wanna bet?

728
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,513
I don't bet.

729
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:24,987
What do you mean,
you don't bet?

730
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,717
I mean I don't bet.
I don't gamble.

731
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,782
( deep voice )
Pussy pussy pussy!

732
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,852
- I never have, and I never will.
- Yeah, right!

733
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,626
I'll bet you 20 bucks
I can get you gambling

734
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,758
- before the end of the day.
- No way.

735
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,462
- I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.
- Nope.

736
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,662
- 5-to-1?
- Nope.

737
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,898
- 10-to-1?
- You're on.

738
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,305
( both chuckle )

739
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:46,942
I'm going
to get you.

740
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,810
- Huh-uh.
- Oh, yeah.

741
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,974
I don't know how,
but I'm going to get you.

742
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:55,144
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Nuh-uh.

743
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,949
Come on, Joe.
Let me do them.

744
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,784
Let me do
both of them.

745
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:00,381
You wouldn't even have
to worry about it.

746
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:01,948
Just shut up!

747
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,119
Now, we don't even know
who the hell they are.

748
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,152
You don't kill people
you don't know.

749
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,596
That's a rule.

750
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,996
Now, I want you
to get up here,

751
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,466
Iie down
on the front seat.

752
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,403
When they pick me up,
you follow us. You got that?

753
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,770
Keep your shirt on.
I gotta squeeze a lemon.

754
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,215
Mental : Hey, hey, hey.
Here they come.

755
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,014
Stay down, stay down!

756
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:42,494
Say, uh, are you guys
going to Davenport?

757
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,866
My car died, and I'm late
for a luncheon.

758
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:51,168
We usually don't
pick up hitchhikers,

759
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:55,008
but I'm going to go with my instinct
on this one.

760
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,513
Saddle up, partner.

761
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,680
You're it.

762
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,743
- You're it.
- You're it! Quitsies!

763
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,845
Anti-quitsies.
You're it. Quitsies. No anti-quitsies.

764
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,186
- No startsies.
- You can't do that.

765
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,191
- Can too.
- Cannot. Stamped it.

766
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,749
Can too. Double-stamped it.
No erasies.

767
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,091
Cannot. Triple-stamped it.
No erasies.

768
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:14,723
You can't triple-stamp
a double-stamp!

769
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,666
You can't triple-stamp
a double-stamp, Lloyd!

770
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,692
You can't triple-stamp a double-stamp.
Lloyd! Lloyd!

771
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,432
Guys! Enough!

772
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:29,276
Hey, you wanna hear the most annoying
sound in the world?

773
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,748
( screeches )

774
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:35,809
Guys! Guys! Guys!

775
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:41,281
Fellas,
you think we could

776
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,793
Iisten to the radio
or something?

777
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,997
Radio?
( laughs )

778
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:50,023
Who needs a radio?
Ready, Harry?

779
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,264
- # Mock- #
- # Yeah #

780
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,238
- # -ing- #
- # Yeah #

781
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,570
- # -bird #
- # Yeah #

782
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:59,269
- Lloyd: # Yeah #
- # Yeah #

783
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,278
Both:
# Mockingbird #

784
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,679
# Don't-- everybody,
have you heard? #

785
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,014
# She's gonna buy me
a mockingbird #

786
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:12,751
# And if that mockingbird
don't sing #

787
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,886
# She's gonna buy me
a diamond ring #

788
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,987
# And if that diamond ring
don't shine... #

789
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,998
Hey, Lloyd, look! There's some people
who want a ride too.

790
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,021
Pick 'em up!

791
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,264
( cows moo )

792
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,101
( playing
acoustic guitar )

793
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,630
- Harry and Lloyd: # Mock- #
- # S #

794
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,165
- # -ing- #
- # S#

795
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,269
- # -bird #
- # S #

796
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,542
Harry and Lloyd:
# S #

797
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,987
Harry: You want an atomic
pepper, Mr. Mentaliano?

798
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,627
Nah, you guys
go ahead.

799
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,893
I'll do it
if you will, Lloyd.

800
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,627
Okay.
You go first.

801
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,259
No, huh-uh, no,
you go first.

802
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,270
- No, you go first.
- No, you go first.

803
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,296
- No, you go first.
- I always go first!

804
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,672
Why don't you guys
both stop acting

805
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,336
Iike a couple
of pussies

806
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,608
and go at
the same time, huh?

807
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,612
- That sounds like a dare, Harry.
- It's a double-dare.

808
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,244
Yeah, okay,
you're on.

809
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,881
Mmm!

810
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:27,386
- Huh. It's not so bad.
- Uh-huh.

811
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,023
Yeah. It's more
tingly than hot.

812
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,728
- Yeah.
- ( coughing )

813
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,634
Agh!

814
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,267
( both screaming,
gagging )

815
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,670
Uh, if you fellas
would excuse me,

816
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,649
I've got to use
the phone.

817
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,675
Enjoy your meal,
guys.

818
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,778
( whimpering )

819
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:52,789
Here, Lloyd,
this helps!

820
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,814
Here here.

821
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,382
It--
it works good.

822
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,418
Ugh!

823
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:07,364
Yeah, it's Mental.
I'm just sitting down

824
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,271
- to a nice meal with our boys.
- Well, how nice for you.

825
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:12,798
Don't forget that your bread plate
is on the left!

826
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,835
Look, I can't have these guys
running around Aspen.

827
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,404
Don't worry. They ain't gonna be
runnin' around nowhere

828
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,646
after I dump a little rat poison
in their Shirley Temple.

829
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,114
( "The Bear Song"
playing )

830
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,819
- Good good.
- Okay, that's good.

831
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,328
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

832
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,820
Feeling better,
girls?

833
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,265
Yes, much better.
Thank you for asking.

834
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:41,101
# The other side of the mountain was all
that he could see, so! #

835
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:44,107
# He went back over the mountain to see
what he could see, hey! #

836
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,735
So why are you going
to Aspen? Vacation?

837
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,307
Why don't you eat up
and we'll tell you?

838
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,814
( both snorting )

839
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,010
It just doesn't seem like
you packed much.

840
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:57,111
All I saw was one bag
and that briefcase.

841
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,452
Well, no no, the briefcase
isn't even ours.

842
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,287
Some lady left it
at the airport.

843
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,020
We're just bringing
it back to her.

844
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,755
How's your burger?

845
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,795
You mean, you don't
even know her?

846
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,267
( laughing )

847
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,863
I mean,

848
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:22,208
talk about being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

849
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:25,738
# The bear went over the mountain to see
what he could see, hey! #

850
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,843
# The other side of the mountain was all
that he could see, so!

851
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,878
# So he went back over the mountain to see
what he could see, hey! #

852
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:34,447
# The other side of the mountain was all
the he could see! #

853
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,721
( kettle whistling )

854
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,132
( groaning )

855
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,296
( both laughing )

856
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,441
Are you okay, man?
It was just a goof.

857
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,811
Oh, my ulcer!

858
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,339
Quick!
My pills!

859
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,852
Waitress: Maybe somebody should
call an ambulance.

860
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,183
Look, uh,
you get the pills.

861
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,018
Don't worry.
I know CPR.

862
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,216
I'll get
the pills.

863
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,282
Out with the bad air,
in with the good.

864
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,556
- Out with the bad air--
- Get off!

865
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,128
Ugh!

866
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,903
Agh, don't!
Don't don't!

867
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,236
Back back!

868
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:26,868
This is a lot easier
if you just lay back.

869
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,276
- Here.
- He's resisting me!

870
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:32,544
Here.
Here we go, here we go.

871
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,483
- Lloyd: Pills!
- There you go! There you go.

872
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,418
- Pills are good!
- Take 'em down.

873
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:38,478
- Pills are good!
- Drink 'em down.

874
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,251
There you go.

875
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,155
- There you go, big guy.
- That's better!

876
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,160
You want some ketchup
and mustard?

877
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,254
That helped us.

878
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:52,791
Son of a bitch!
( gurgling )

879
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:04,305
Check, please.

880
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,943
I can't
believe it.

881
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,284
Life's a fragile
thing, Harr.

882
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:14,222
One minute you're
chewing on a burger,

883
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:16,522
the next minute
you're dead meat.

884
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,994
But he blamed me.
You heard him.

885
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:20,894
Those were
his last words.

886
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,560
Not if you count
the gurgling sound.

887
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,439
- You mean he was poisoned?
- No doubt about it.

888
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,603
We found these
next to the body.

889
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,545
- Sir.
- Yeah?

890
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,310
Waitress says he came in with
a couple of younger guys.

891
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,648
Now they're the ones who called the
ambulance, and then they hit the road.

892
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,416
- Get any idea where they were going?
- We just received a report

893
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,447
that they were seen headed west on l-80
towards Colorado.

894
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,585
Did you get a make
on the vehicle?

895
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,023
Uh, yes, sir.

896
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:58,501
They're driving
an '84... sheepdog.

897
00:48:58,535 --> 00:48:58,769
( rock music playing )

898
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,101
( rock music playing )

899
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,606
( tires screech )

900
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,378
- # Take... #
- ( snoring )

901
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:23,087
# Take a picture,
take a little time #

902
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,390
# No need to dig
through the dumpster #

903
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,956
# For all the stuff you thought that you'd left
behind... #

904
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:34,034
# Take my car #

905
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,699
# Drive it
to the outside world #

906
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:41,074
# Take it far,
farther now from me #

907
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,373
# Take it all #

908
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:45,176
# Happy, girl,
the fact is #

909
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,080
# Take my heart #

910
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:50,382
# Take take
take me apart. #

911
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:57,559
Skis, huh?

912
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,084
That's right.

913
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,097
Great.

914
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,361
They yours?

915
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,330
Uh-huh.

916
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,835
Both of 'em?

917
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,474
Yeah.

918
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,345
Cool.

919
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:23,085
Um, excuse me,
but you're, uh...

920
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,418
you're spraying
everywhere.

921
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,946
Oh!

922
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:33,294
( whistling,
urinating )

923
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,313
( door opens )

924
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,338
( door closes )

925
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,873
( footsteps approach )

926
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,611
( zips pants )

927
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,760
( door rattling )

928
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,208
- ( screams )
- Oh, man, you gotta be shitting me.

929
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,008
If it ain't
my old friend!

930
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:28,985
And right on time.

931
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:34,624
( whimpering )

932
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:41,093
That's a lot of luggage
for a little vacation.

933
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,156
- I'm moving to Aspen.
- Oh.

934
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,226
I've got to get away from my boyfriend.
He's such a klutz.

935
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:49,067
Plus, my astrologer told me that
I really should stay away

936
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,404
from accident-prone guys,
so, you know.

937
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,068
Oh, well,
you know, l--

938
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,510
Here. It's a little loose.
You might want to--

939
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,643
- Mm. Thank you.
- Oh, no. Hey, no, allow me.

940
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,654
I've got
a thing of--

941
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:07,122
here.
Got 'em right here. Right here.

942
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:14,823
- ( gasoline ignites )
- Thank you.

943
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,834
Sure. You know, I'm heading up
to Aspen myself.

944
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,563
Maybe we could,
you know, meet up,

945
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,628
have some hot chocolate
or something.

946
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,364
Sure, why not?
You seem harmless.

947
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,773
I'm going to
give you my number.

948
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,641
- Let me find a pen though.
- Great!

949
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,839
- Let's see.
- That's-- ah!

950
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,145
- I know I have one in here somewhere.
- Look, why don't you

951
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,117
just tell it to me?
I got a really good memory.

952
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,313
- Well, the number's 555...
- 555.

953
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:40,346
905-- wait a minute.
That's my old number.

954
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,620
That is so weird how
your mind just goes blank.

955
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,492
For God's sakes, just
give me the damn number!

956
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:49,124
Okay, look, uh, you gonna get pushy,
forget about it.

957
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,800
Find a happy place.

958
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,901
Find a happy place.
Find a happy place.

959
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,504
I'll show you
a happy place.

960
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,449
Here's your happy place.

961
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,256
- ( yells )
- ( groans )

962
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,922
( panting )

963
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,340
( whimpers )

964
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,818
( police radio chattering )

965
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,945
Man: Move those cars!
Move it! Move it!

966
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,195
Go around, man.
Go around.

967
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,926
More flags over here!

968
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,900
All right,
any sign of them yet?

969
00:53:57,934 --> 00:53:59,925
No, sir, but we're
expecting them shortly.

970
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:03,098
A motorist saw a pooch about 30 miles
back headed this way.

971
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:11,273
Look, I told you what happened, okay?
So just drop it.

972
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:13,441
Yeah, okay. Sure thing, Lloyd.
Sure thing.

973
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,951
I promise not
to mention another word

974
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,454
about you being
in a bathroom

975
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,456
with a 6'4" trucker
with his pants down.

976
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:22,890
( laughs )

977
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,000
Hey, look.
We're almost in Colorado.

978
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:35,266
What do you say
we change seats?

979
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,535
I've been driving
for nine straight hours.

980
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:40,543
I don't have the energy
to start a new state.

981
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,477
Why should I do you
any favors?

982
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:45,572
I'll let you kiss me.
( laughs )

983
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,583
I swear...

984
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,881
I'm gonna--
I will take your--

985
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:52,479
I'm-- I swear to God
I'm gonna take your--

986
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,355
- Aw, come on--
- Don't touch me.

987
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,622
( mocking )
Oh, okay.

988
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:04,061
I'm done.
Okay, enough.

989
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,067
( mimics truck horn,
giggling )

990
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,273
( laughing )

991
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:19,541
Hey, guys.
Whoa, Big Gulps, huh?

992
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,277
All right.

993
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,946
Well, see you later.

994
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,823
- ( snoring )
- Hey, Harry,

995
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,757
I got some beef jerk--

996
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,994
Some people just weren't cut out
for life on the road.

997
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,298
( "Crash" playing )

998
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,534
# Here you go,
way too fast #

999
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,007
# Don't slow down,
you're gonna crash #

1000
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:49,375
# You should watch,
watch your step #

1001
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,710
# Don 't look out,
gonna break your neck #

1002
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,740
# So shut,
shut your mouth #

1003
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:57,412
# 'Cause I'm not
listening anyhow #

1004
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,321
# I've had enough,
enough of you #

1005
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,326
# Enough to last
a lifetime through #

1006
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,089
# With you #

1007
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:09,155
( fades )
# You. #

1008
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,434
Hey!

1009
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:16,064
I was wondering when
you were gonna get up.

1010
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,903
Ha!

1011
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,876
Well, how long
have I been out?

1012
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,173
I'd say
a good five hours.

1013
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,551
Huh! I expected
the Rocky Mountains

1014
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:35,717
to be a little
rockier than this.

1015
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,557
I was thinking
the same thing.

1016
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:42,087
That John Denver's
full of shit, man.

1017
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,132
I'm only human, Harry!

1018
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:51,607
Anybody can
make a mistake.

1019
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:55,008
Come on,
stop being a baby!

1020
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,569
So we backtracked
a tad!

1021
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,514
A tad?!

1022
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,642
A tad, Lloyd?

1023
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,744
You drove almost
1/6 of the way

1024
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:08,121
across the country
in the wrong direction!

1025
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,418
Now we don't have enough money
to get to Aspen!

1026
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,123
We don't have enough
money to get home!

1027
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:16,655
We don't have enough
money to eat!

1028
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,327
We don't have enough
money to sleep!

1029
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,901
Well, it's not gonna
do us any good

1030
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,770
to sit here
whining about it.

1031
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,901
- We're in a hole.
- ( "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" playing )

1032
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,411
We're just going to have to
dig ourselves out.

1033
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,642
Okay, all right.
You're right.

1034
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,582
You're absolutely
right, Lloyd.

1035
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,915
- # Mmm mmm mmm mmm #
- Where're you going?

1036
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:40,650
- # Mmm mmm mmm mmm #
- Home. I'm walking home.

1037
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:45,184
Oh, well, pardon me,
Mr. Perfect!

1038
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,991
I guess I forgot

1039
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,658
that you never,
ever make a mistake!

1040
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:52,759
( singer vocalizing )

1041
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,147
Lloyd : Harry!

1042
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,887
Harry!

1043
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:20,623
Harry!

1044
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,927
Harry!
Wait up!

1045
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,332
- ( engine backfires )
- ( yells )

1046
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,474
( bell rings )

1047
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,480
( bird cawing )

1048
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,483
Got room for one more
if you still want to go to Aspen.

1049
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,644
Where did you
find that?

1050
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,210
Some kid
back in town.

1051
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,951
Traded the van for it
straight up.

1052
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:51,154
I can get 70 miles
to the gallon on this hog.

1053
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,033
You know, Lloyd,
just when I think

1054
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,595
you couldn't possibly
be any dumber,

1055
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,837
you go and do
something like this...

1056
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:10,710
and totally
redeem yourself!

1057
00:59:10,747 --> 00:59:13,944
Ha ha!

1058
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,213
- Still wanna go to Aspen?
- Oh, yeah!

1059
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,915
- Okay, let's go, buddy!
- Super!

1060
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:22,823
- ( bell rings )
- ( "Where I Find My Heaven" playing )

1061
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:26,795
- Lloyd, no! West! Go west, Lloyd!
- Oh! Oh, yeah.

1062
00:59:35,672 --> 00:59:38,766
# Hey, Monday morning #

1063
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:42,209
# Is only for the brave #

1064
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,874
# And the blood flows
through my heart and veins #

1065
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,578
# Like sand as I shave #

1066
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:52,884
# And the wind outside #

1067
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,652
# And the taxi's ready... #

1068
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:58,661
- ( horn honks )
- # And the lonesome hum #

1069
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,993
# That comes
from my desk lamp #

1070
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:04,796
# Is where I find
my heaven #

1071
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:10,204
# It's where I find
my heaven... #

1072
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,341
I've got to--
I've got to stop

1073
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:16,572
to go to
the bathroom.

1074
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,013
Just go, man.

1075
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,147
Oh!

1076
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,217
That sure is warm.

1077
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,118
# It's where I find
my heaven #

1078
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:36,859
- # It's where I find my heaven #
- # Where I find my-- #

1079
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,094
# It's where I find
my heaven... #

1080
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,865
( truck horn honks )

1081
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:45,635
# Heav... #

1082
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:50,476
# Heaven. #

1083
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:01,948
( both shivering )

1084
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,562
( bell tolling )

1085
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,908
We're there.

1086
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,327
Got a little nippy

1087
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,331
going through
the pass back there.

1088
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:47,361
Lloyd:
lsn't this incredible?

1089
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:50,372
- What more could two single guys want?
- How about some food?

1090
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:53,375
I swallowed a big June bug
when we were driving.

1091
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,899
I'm not
really hungry.

1092
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:56,878
Well, I'm starving.

1093
01:01:56,913 --> 01:02:00,007
Ho-- Jeez, look at
the butt on that.

1094
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,108
Lloyd: Yeah.

1095
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,984
He must work out.

1096
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:07,080
Hey! Why don't we get busy

1097
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,988
and deliver
the briefcase to Mary?

1098
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,754
If I know her as well
as I think I do

1099
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:12,988
she'll invite us right in
for tea and strumpets.

1100
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,088
Good plan.
Where does she live?

1101
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:17,031
I don't know.

1102
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,728
What's her last name?
I'll look it up.

1103
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:21,703
Uh...

1104
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,230
You know, I don't
really recall.

1105
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:27,105
Starts with an "S."

1106
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:31,341
S-swim, Swamie,
S-slippy, Slappy,

1107
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:34,042
Slimin, Solmon,
Simin, Sal,

1108
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:35,243
Swenson, Swanson?

1109
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,081
Maybe it's on
the briefcase.

1110
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,985
Oh, yeah!
It's right here.

1111
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,421
Samsonite!
I was way off.

1112
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,721
I knew it started
with an "S" though.

1113
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,254
I'm not seeing
it here, Lloyd.

1114
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,560
She must be unlisted.

1115
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,203
Great.

1116
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:56,467
So what are we
supposed to do now?

1117
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:59,998
( fox howls )

1118
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:04,103
- I can't feel my fi-fingers anymore.
- ( wind whistling )

1119
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,139
They're-they're-
they're numb.

1120
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,979
Ooh. Maybe you should
wear these extra gloves.

1121
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,956
My hands are starting
to get sweaty.

1122
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:18,188
Extra gloves?

1123
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,525
You've had this pair

1124
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,327
of extra gloves
this whole time?

1125
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,367
Yeah. We're in
the Rockies.

1126
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,735
I'm going to kill you.

1127
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:35,467
- What?
- I'm gonna kill you!

1128
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:38,810
- I'm gonna kill you, Lloyd!
- Calm down!

1129
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,372
Right now,
I'm gonna kill you!

1130
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,748
Harry, you got that crazy look
in your eye!

1131
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:48,312
( chuckles )
I know what I'm going to do.

1132
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,484
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to do something

1133
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:53,051
I should have done
a long time ago.

1134
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,860
Don't do anything
foolish, Harry!

1135
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,230
What? Foolish?
This isn't foolish!

1136
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:00,565
I'm going to toss
this damn curse

1137
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,901
right into
that damn pond!

1138
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,668
Aah!

1139
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:09,372
- I'm going to do it!
- No, Harry!

1140
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:14,215
( screams )
Harry!

1141
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,844
Your hands
are freezing!

1142
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:19,286
Aah! Ugh!

1143
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:21,586
Harry, look!

1144
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:24,320
Look! Look!

1145
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:31,396
Okay, here's the plan:

1146
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:34,301
We borrow a few bucks--
just a small loan from the briefcase

1147
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:37,363
- and we find some reasonable lodgings.
- Good plan.

1148
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:40,102
And we'll keep track of all the money
we spend with lOUs.

1149
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,372
We'll be meticulous,
right down to the last penny.

1150
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,845
- Whatever we borrow, we pay back.
- Absolutely.

1151
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,281
- We're good for it.
- Our word is our bond.

1152
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,976
This is
the Hotel Danbury

1153
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,988
Presidential Suite,
gentlemen,

1154
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:55,013

for royalty,

1156
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,293
illustrious stars
of stage and screen.

1157
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:02,855
We have shortly coming the Emperor
and Empress of Japan,

1158
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,868
and of course, Princess Charles and Di
when they were together

1159
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,893
used to frequent
the hotel constantly.

1160
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,427
We'll take it!

1161

There you go.

1169
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,439
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

1170
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:46,407
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

1171
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,103
- There you go.
- Thank you, sir.

1172
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,544
There you go.

1173
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,313
Hi.

Girl on TV:
My mother was Sarah Carver.

1177
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:02,684
Narrator:
Although at the time, he wasn't sure

1178
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,989
he wanted to accept the gift.

1179
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,393
Girl on TV :
Nick, do you think he 'll let us stay?

1180
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,455
Nick on TV :
No, this place is ugly, anyway.

1181
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:12,592
You and me,
we 're a family.

1182
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,160
Man :
I promise never to give you away.

1183
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:18,037
And no one 's
ever going to break us apart.

1184
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:21,237
At Pacific Bell, we believe
that's pretty special.

- Yeah.

- I don't know.

1188

Let me look it up.

It's who?

Mary with

This is our
big chance, man.

All we gotta do

is show a little class,
a little sophistication,

1251

and we're in like
a dirty shirt.

That's no problem, Lloyd.
We can be classy and sophistic--

Mr. Swanson forward

1267
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,648
to introduce us
to the 24th. Everybody--

1268
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:57,618
Karl.

1269
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,814
Thank you, Nick.

1270
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:03,791
Thank you.

1271
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,623
Ladies and gentlemen,

1272
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:08,653
I give you
the lcelandic snow owl.

1273
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:12,463
( drum roll )

1274
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:13,695
( cymbals crash )

1275
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:16,296
( applause )

1276
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:19,796
These magnificent specimens
constitute one seventh

1277
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:22,675
of the snow owl population
left on the planet.

1278
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,646
And God willing,
with your help

1279
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,740
and that of
the Society's,

1280
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:30,946
these wonderful creatures
will flourish once more.

1281
01:11:30,986 --> 01:11:34,183
Thank you again
and enjoy your evening.

1282
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,022
Can I have
some pistachios, please?

1283
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,828
And another one
of those.

1284
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,265
Lloyd, what are you doing?
Would you calm down?

1285
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,769
I've never seen you
so nervous.

1286
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:51,534
Keep an eye on 'em, Shay.
Keep a close eye.

1287
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,734
I'm ready for
a commitment, Harry.

1288
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,609
The first time
I set eyes on Mary Swanson,

1289
01:11:56,645 --> 01:12:00,308
I just got that old-fashioned
romantic feeling

1290
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:02,613
where I'd do anything
to bone her.

1291
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,744
That's a special
feeling, Lloyd.

1292
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:06,778
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1293
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:09,882
Oh my,
there she is.

1294
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:12,291
Wow! You weren't
kidding, Lloyd.

1295
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,990
She's an angel!
( whistles )

1296
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,761
Well, what are
you waiting for?

1297
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,633
Get over there
and talk to her.

1298
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,805
She's just going to think
I'm some kind of a psycho

1299
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:29,072
when she finds out
how far I came just to see her!

1300
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:30,976
You know what you have?!
Her briefcase!

1301
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:34,005
She's gonna be
thrilled to see you.

1302
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:37,348
Wait.
I have an idea.

1303
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,952
Why don't you go over

1304
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:42,923
and introduce yourself?

1305
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:44,926
And that way,
you can build me up

1306
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,928
so I won't have to
brag about myself later.

1307
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,896
Tell her I'm rich

1308
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:51,399
and, uh,
I'm good-looking

1309
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:53,458
and, uh, I have
a rapist wit.

1310
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:55,561
No, I don't know.
I don't think I could-- no.

1311
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:58,368
- Come on, please.
- No, I'm not--

1312
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:01,501
- Please! Please!
- Okay okay okay. Stop.

1313
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,443
What are you gonna do?

1314
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,743
I'm going to
hang by the bar,

1315
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:09,148
- put out the vibe.
- Okay.

1316
01:13:19,828 --> 01:13:22,228
Nice set of hooters
you got there.

1317
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:27,798
- I beg your pardon?
- The owls, they're beautiful.

1318
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:31,503
Oh.

1319
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,508
Yeah.

1320
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,476
Are you
a bird lover?

1321
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:38,002
Me? Oh, no.
Well, I used to have a parakeet--

1322
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:40,947
- Ah.
- --but now my main area of expertise

1323
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:43,474
is, uh, canines--

1324
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,646
"dogs"
to the layperson.

1325
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,850
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

1326
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:52,827
- I love dogs too.
- Oh.

1327
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:55,125
- So how are you involved with them?
- Oh, you know,

1328
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:58,133
I've trained them, bathed them,
clipped them.

1329
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,930
- I've even bred them.
- Oh, really?

1330
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,936
- Any unusual breeding?
- No.

1331
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,029
Mostly just doggy-style.

1332
01:14:04,072 --> 01:14:07,405
One time,
we successfully mated

1333
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,809
a bulldog
with a shih-tzu.

1334
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:12,746
Really?
That's weird.

1335
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,409
Yeah. We--
we called it a bullshit.

1336
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,180
( laughing hysterically )

1337
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,860
Oh, I'm-- anyway,
the real reason

1338
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:31,058
I came over here
was to--

1339
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:34,034
I've got to introduce you
to a buddy of mine.

1340
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:37,527
- I don't believe I've met your friend.
- Oh.

1341
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:40,064
Well, actually, we haven't been
properly introduced.

1342
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:42,872
- My name is Mary Swanson.
- Hi, Harry Dunne.

1343
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:45,641
Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is my stepmother Helen.

1344
01:14:45,681 --> 01:14:47,945
Hi. Harry Dunne.
Pleasure to meet you both.

1345
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,178
Mm-hmm. Well,
I saw you come in.

1346
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,517
I was hoping I'd get
a chance to meet you.

1347
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:56,752
- You were? Really?
- Yes! That tuxedo, it's fabulous!

1348
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:59,590
Really. I love a man
with a sense of humor,

1349
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:02,495
and so does Mary.
It's hysterical!

1350
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,089
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

1351
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:07,124
Oh. Anyway, um,
about my friend--

1352
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,502
What are you doing tomorrow?
I believe that Mary

1353
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,200
is looking for someone
to hit the slopes with.

1354
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,970
She-- what? Huh?

1355
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,944
Helen, you're
embarrassing me.

1356
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:18,947
Well, you are.
I mean, after all,

1357
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:21,108
the snow's going to be gone
in a couple of weeks.

1358
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:23,014
and, well, this may be
your last chance.

1359
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,144
Poor thing, she never
gets a chance to get out.

1360
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,849
Well, what do you say, Mr. Dunne?
Are you available?

1361
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,188
Well, I don't know.
See, my friend--

1362
01:15:30,225 --> 01:15:32,090
Oh, forget your friend
for one day.

1363
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:35,221
I think you kids'll have
a wonderful time. What do you say?

1364
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,494
Well, you know,
I don't know, you know.

1365
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,967
You know, the thing--
part of-- sure.

1366
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,130
What time?
Ahem--

1367
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:49,033
How come you didn't
bring her over?

1368
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:51,045
Relax.
You're golden.

1369
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,513
- I got you a date with her tomorrow.
- Oh.

1370
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:57,551
- ( stammers ) What-- l-- this--
- Yeah.

1371
01:15:57,586 --> 01:15:59,850
- I love you, man.
- Okay okay.

1372
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,719
- You're kissing me.
- I love you.

1373
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,225
- I love you!
- You're kissing me. Lloyd!

1374
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:09,256
This calls for
a little of the bubbly!

1375
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,528
- You're going to be my best man, Harr.
- Oh, good.

1376
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,125
- I promise.
- Thank you.

1377
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,136
You have just
earned yourself a seat

1378
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:19,129
at the head table, pal.
And we already got the tuxes.

1379
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:22,276
- ( loud thud )
- ( owl squawks )

1380
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,313
- Woman: Gracious sakes!
- ( crowd murmuring )

1381
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:32,013
- Man : Good grief!
- Boy, this party really died.

1382
01:16:39,124 --> 01:16:41,615
Hey, maybe it was
a coincidence.

1383
01:16:41,659 --> 01:16:44,184
( mimics )
Hey, maybe it was a coincidence.

1384
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:47,687
It was a message, Shay,
pure and simple.

1385
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:49,927
I mean, we killed
their bird.

1386
01:16:49,968 --> 01:16:52,994
Now they killed
one of ours.

1387
01:16:54,939 --> 01:16:56,998
How could anybody
whack a bird with a cork?

1388
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:59,339
These guys aren't
just anybody.

1389
01:16:59,377 --> 01:17:02,437
They're good.

1390
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:10,651
Mary Christmas.

1391
01:17:10,688 --> 01:17:13,452
Mrs. Mary Christmas.

1392
01:17:15,026 --> 01:17:18,427
- Kinda catchy, huh, Harr?
- Yeah yeah, that sounds nice.

1393
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,864
But, Lloyd, don't you think you might be
jumping the gun a little bit?

1394
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,834
I mean, you know,
who knows?

1395
01:17:23,868 --> 01:17:25,733
You know, maybe,
once you get to know her

1396
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:28,102
you'll find out
that she's not your type.

1397
01:17:30,175 --> 01:17:31,938
Hey!

1398
01:17:31,976 --> 01:17:35,139
Don't you ever
say that again!

1399
01:17:36,214 --> 01:17:38,205
She is the love
of my life!

1400
01:17:38,249 --> 01:17:40,683
The blood in my veins!

1401
01:17:40,718 --> 01:17:42,413
We belong together...

1402
01:17:42,453 --> 01:17:44,751
till the mountains
fall into the sea,

1403
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:46,689
till the heavens
collide!

1404
01:17:46,724 --> 01:17:49,318
Or until I get sick of her
and need to move on.

1405
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,796
- You hear me?!
- Okay okay okay okay. Just calm down.

1406
01:17:52,831 --> 01:17:54,696
Just calm down.

1407
01:17:54,732 --> 01:17:57,223
( panting )
Okay.

1408
01:17:57,268 --> 01:18:00,328
Now...

1409
01:18:00,371 --> 01:18:02,839
Iet me
get this straight.

1410
01:18:02,874 --> 01:18:06,071
Lobby bar
in the lobby.

1411
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:07,873
Yeah, and that's
what she said.

1412
01:18:07,912 --> 01:18:10,142
She'll meet you there
at 10:00 sharp.

1413
01:18:11,216 --> 01:18:13,343
- Okay.
- Okay.

1414
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,150
Where're you going
in that get-up?

1415
01:18:19,824 --> 01:18:21,815
Oh. I-- you know, I just thought,
you know,

1416
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:23,953
when you'd be off making
your love connection

1417
01:18:23,995 --> 01:18:26,293
I'd be out trying my luck
on the slopes.

1418
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,299
You mean you're gonna
go out in public

1419
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:30,324
dressed in tights?

1420
01:18:30,368 --> 01:18:32,302
Oh no, these aren't
tights, Lloyd.

1421
01:18:32,337 --> 01:18:34,805
These are fashionable
Euro-trash ski trousers.

1422
01:18:34,839 --> 01:18:37,137
Pretty revealing.

1423
01:18:38,142 --> 01:18:39,439
Really?

1424
01:18:39,477 --> 01:18:41,502
Yeah, but it's
just a tiny lump.

1425
01:18:41,546 --> 01:18:43,946
No one'll notice.

1426
01:18:43,982 --> 01:18:46,542
You're right.
I can't go out dressed like this.

1427
01:18:48,786 --> 01:18:48,953
( "New Age Girl"
playing )

1428
01:18:48,953 --> 01:18:51,979
( "New Age Girl"
playing )

1429
01:18:52,023 --> 01:18:55,424
# Rah! #

1430
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:59,123
- # I've got a New Age girl #
- # Tell us what she's like #

1431
01:18:59,163 --> 01:19:02,792
- # Environmentalist girl #
- # Does she ride a bike? #

1432
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:04,893
- # She has a crystal necklace... #
- Hey!

1433
01:19:04,936 --> 01:19:06,460
- Coming!
- # She spend a lot of cash? #

1434
01:19:06,504 --> 01:19:08,495
# Though her vibes
are rather reckless #

1435
01:19:08,539 --> 01:19:11,303
- # Heading for the crash... #
- Hey!

1436
01:19:11,342 --> 01:19:14,106
Man :
Nice going, buddy!

1437
01:19:14,145 --> 01:19:16,875
#...and she wonders about knowing,
where did we begin? #

1438
01:19:16,915 --> 01:19:19,509
# Mary Moon #

1439
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:23,543
- # She 's a vegetarian #
- # Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon #

1440
01:19:23,588 --> 01:19:28,389
# Mary Moon will help with all
the septuagenarians... #

1441
01:19:28,426 --> 01:19:31,088
- # Mary Moon, Mary Moon, Mary Moon.
- Ma 'am.

1442
01:19:31,129 --> 01:19:35,156
# Mary Moon,
she 's an intellectual... #

1443
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,167
Beautiful outfit,
sir.

1444
01:19:37,201 --> 01:19:39,260
There you go.

1445
01:19:39,304 --> 01:19:42,865
# Mary Moon, despite that fact,
remains quite sexual #

1446
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:45,398
# Mary Moon, Mary Moon,
Mary Moon. #

1447
01:19:50,014 --> 01:19:52,812
Hey.
How you doin'?

1448
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,511
You're a little early.

1449
01:19:54,552 --> 01:19:57,521
We don't open
for about 45 minutes.

1450
01:19:57,555 --> 01:19:59,955
I'm meeting
someone here.

1451
01:19:59,991 --> 01:20:04,223
- Mind if I wait at the bar?
- No. Come on in.

1452
01:20:06,631 --> 01:20:09,259
It's a beautiful day,
huh, Harry?

1453
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:13,100
Yes yes, I've had a wonderful time
so far. Thank you.

1454
01:20:13,137 --> 01:20:16,072
God, it feels
so good to get up here.

1455
01:20:16,107 --> 01:20:19,543
I haven't been outside that much
in the last couple weeks.

1456
01:20:19,577 --> 01:20:22,011
Oh, yeah?
Why not?

1457
01:20:22,046 --> 01:20:25,914
Um, there's been
some family problems,

1458
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:28,919
but I don't want
to bore you with those.

1459
01:20:28,953 --> 01:20:30,944
Thanks.

1460
01:20:30,989 --> 01:20:33,423
Oh, look. Frost.

1461
01:20:36,661 --> 01:20:40,290
- Harry?
- ( grunting )

1462
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,164
- Are you okay?
- ( muffled ) Oh, yeah,

1463
01:20:44,202 --> 01:20:47,399
I do this all the time.

1464
01:20:50,975 --> 01:20:53,273
Let's go to the top
this time.

1465
01:21:00,218 --> 01:21:04,177
- Hi, there.
- Ugh...

1466
01:21:04,222 --> 01:21:05,951
Say, kids,

1467
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:07,890
you wouldn't
happen to have

1468
01:21:07,925 --> 01:21:10,018
a cup of warm water,
would you?

1469
01:21:10,061 --> 01:21:12,689
( slurps )
Yuck.

1470
01:21:16,434 --> 01:21:18,402
Excuse me.

1471
01:21:18,436 --> 01:21:20,631
Is it 10:00 A.M. yet?

1472
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:23,800
It's 1 :00.

1473
01:21:26,477 --> 01:21:30,607
That's what I have too.
Thought maybe it was fast.

1474
01:21:33,618 --> 01:21:36,314
She's running late,
huh?

1475
01:21:36,354 --> 01:21:39,619
Just a couple hours.
You know girls.

1476
01:21:39,657 --> 01:21:42,353
When they're excited
about something,

1477
01:21:42,393 --> 01:21:44,725
everything has to
be perfect.

1478
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:54,329
This one's on me.

1479
01:21:56,474 --> 01:21:58,465
Yippee.

1480
01:21:58,509 --> 01:22:00,443
Chablis, please.

1481
01:22:01,446 --> 01:22:03,641
Hello.

1482
01:22:05,349 --> 01:22:07,374
( belching )

1483
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,713
Bad day, huh?

1484
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:15,123
Me too.

1485
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:17,024
'Course everything's
been bad

1486
01:22:17,061 --> 01:22:19,291
since I broke up
with my boyfriend.

1487
01:22:32,376 --> 01:22:34,810
( whispers )
Oh my God.

1488
01:22:38,049 --> 01:22:40,279
My God! You poor guy.
Does it hurt?

1489
01:22:40,318 --> 01:22:43,219
I'm fine. I saved
a seat for you.

1490
01:22:43,254 --> 01:22:45,017
( taps )

1491
01:22:45,056 --> 01:22:46,751
Oh no, listen. This is silly.
Let me help you.

1492
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:48,691
No no no no no.

1493
01:22:48,726 --> 01:22:51,058
Yes. It'll only hurt for a moment,
like a Band-Aid.

1494
01:22:51,095 --> 01:22:53,529
- Come on, ready?
- No no no no. No.

1495
01:22:53,564 --> 01:22:55,395
Come on. Go.

1496
01:22:55,433 --> 01:22:57,298
( grunting )

1497
01:22:57,335 --> 01:22:59,326
( crackling )

1498
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:25,593
# Well, if you want,
I'll be by your side #

1499
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:29,691
# And if you don't,
maybe suicide #

1500
01:23:29,734 --> 01:23:33,568
# It's my love
that'd kill me, dear #

1501
01:23:33,604 --> 01:23:36,767
# If you won 't hold me
and have me near #

1502
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:41,176
# 'Cause I'll be good
to you in every way #

1503
01:23:41,212 --> 01:23:44,375
# I'll give you loving,
baby, every day #

1504
01:23:44,415 --> 01:23:47,816
# A loving that's good enough,
a loving that's all right #

1505
01:23:47,852 --> 01:23:51,083
# I'll love you like an oven
on the coldest night #

1506
01:23:51,122 --> 01:23:53,022
# Whoo! #

1507
01:23:56,227 --> 01:23:57,888
( loud thud )

1508
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:11,003
# 'Cause if you don 't love me,
I'll kill myself #

1509
01:24:13,844 --> 01:24:17,746
# If you don 't love me,
I'll kill myself #

1510
01:24:20,518 --> 01:24:24,545
# If you don 't love me,
I'll kill myself #

1511
01:24:24,589 --> 01:24:26,784
( screams )

1512
01:24:26,824 --> 01:24:32,126
# If you don 't love me,
I'll kill myself #

1513
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:35,360
Come on, come on.

1514
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:37,629
# If you don 't love me. #

1515
01:24:37,668 --> 01:24:42,128
- ( chuckles )
- Pfft.

1516
01:24:42,173 --> 01:24:44,539
What am--

1517
01:24:44,575 --> 01:24:46,770
( laughing )

1518
01:24:47,912 --> 01:24:49,880
I said to myself,
"Run, Beth.

1519
01:24:49,914 --> 01:24:52,678
Run for your life before this man
kills you both."

1520
01:24:52,717 --> 01:24:55,379
Then do you know
what the klutz did?

1521
01:24:55,419 --> 01:24:58,217
No, and I don't care!

1522
01:24:58,256 --> 01:25:01,123
I'm going to tell you, He came home
one night dead drunk

1523
01:25:01,158 --> 01:25:03,217
and decided he wanted
to fix the sink.

1524
01:25:03,261 --> 01:25:04,751
Couldn't believe him.

1525
01:25:04,795 --> 01:25:07,229
Anyway, enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

1526
01:25:07,265 --> 01:25:09,495
- How come you're here?
- Bartender!

1527
01:25:09,533 --> 01:25:11,728
Yeah?

1528
01:25:11,769 --> 01:25:15,637
You wouldn't happen to know
a Mary Swanson, would you?

1529
01:25:15,673 --> 01:25:18,506
Mary Swanson? Yeah.

1530
01:25:18,542 --> 01:25:21,306
She comes in here
all the time.

1531
01:25:21,345 --> 01:25:23,176
What's that
supposed to mean?

1532
01:25:23,214 --> 01:25:24,647
She has dinner.

1533
01:25:24,682 --> 01:25:28,778
Oh. I'm sorry.

1534
01:25:31,188 --> 01:25:32,678
Uh...

1535
01:25:32,723 --> 01:25:36,591
you know where
she lives?

1536
01:25:36,627 --> 01:25:40,654
Yeah, her family has the big place
up on Alpine Drive.

1537
01:25:40,698 --> 01:25:43,826
Alpine Drive?
Big place?

1538
01:25:51,575 --> 01:25:53,907
No way!

1539
01:25:55,513 --> 01:25:57,572
That's great!

1540
01:25:57,615 --> 01:25:59,981
We landed
on the moon!

1541
01:26:06,691 --> 01:26:08,682
I've gotta tell you,

1542
01:26:08,726 --> 01:26:11,354
today was just what I needed.
Thanks a lot, Harry.

1543
01:26:11,395 --> 01:26:14,193
( slurred )
Blell, blit blas...

1544
01:26:14,231 --> 01:26:16,722
it was my pleasure,
Mary.

1545
01:26:16,767 --> 01:26:19,702
So you'll pick me up
tonight at 7:45?

1546
01:26:19,737 --> 01:26:21,568
Well, no, I've got
a few things

1547
01:26:21,605 --> 01:26:23,232
to take care of first.

1548
01:26:23,274 --> 01:26:24,935
Why don't we make it
quarter to 8:00?

1549
01:26:24,975 --> 01:26:29,241
( laughs )
Stop it!

1550
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,874
Okay 7:45.

1551
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:36,184
( kisses ) Bye.

1552
01:27:20,564 --> 01:27:22,555
Doesn't make
any sense, Lloyd.

1553
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,363
She told me
10:00 sharp!

1554
01:27:24,402 --> 01:27:26,734
Are you sure you went
to the right bar?

1555
01:27:26,771 --> 01:27:30,639
Oh, yeah. Yep.
I'm pretty sure.

1556
01:27:30,674 --> 01:27:33,837
Lobby bar.
Right in the lobby.

1557
01:27:33,878 --> 01:27:37,006
Ahh... well...

1558
01:27:37,047 --> 01:27:39,845
maybe she just had
a change of heart.

1559
01:27:39,884 --> 01:27:43,320
Oh, that pisses me off!
That pisses me right off!

1560
01:27:43,354 --> 01:27:45,345
I hate when women
do that, you know?

1561
01:27:45,389 --> 01:27:47,050
She wanted
to see you again!

1562
01:27:47,091 --> 01:27:48,956
She told me that!
And now no?

1563
01:27:48,993 --> 01:27:51,894
Now-- wait a minute!
Wait!

1564
01:27:51,929 --> 01:27:54,864
She must have meant
10:00 at night.

1565
01:27:54,899 --> 01:27:57,424
Do you think?

1566
01:27:57,468 --> 01:28:01,461
Why would she have you meet her
at a bar at 10:00 in the morning?

1567
01:28:01,505 --> 01:28:03,666
I just figured she was
a raging alcoholic.

1568
01:28:03,707 --> 01:28:06,699
( both laughing )

1569
01:28:09,413 --> 01:28:11,677
- Oh, that's th--
- And all this time,

1570
01:28:11,715 --> 01:28:15,617
I've been going through such pain
and personal anguish.

1571
01:28:15,653 --> 01:28:18,713
Such hell!
For nothing!

1572
01:28:18,756 --> 01:28:20,553
Oh, God.
That's funny.

1573
01:28:20,591 --> 01:28:22,923
Oh, that's good stuff.
Oh, boy.

1574
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,690
Well, listen, looks like
you got your night planned,

1575
01:28:25,729 --> 01:28:28,027
so I'm just going to head out
and catch a flick.

1576
01:28:28,065 --> 01:28:29,726
Okay.

1577
01:28:31,735 --> 01:28:34,101
10:00 in the morning.

1578
01:28:50,821 --> 01:28:53,449
Hey, Harry,
old buddy, old pal!

1579
01:28:53,491 --> 01:28:55,118
Yeah?

1580
01:28:55,159 --> 01:28:58,617
Will you join me in a good-luck toast
before you head out?

1581
01:28:58,662 --> 01:29:02,063
Oh, sure thing. Whatever you think
will help your chances.

1582
01:29:02,099 --> 01:29:04,465
Yes, sirree.

1583
01:29:04,502 --> 01:29:06,766
You know why
I like you, Harry?

1584
01:29:06,804 --> 01:29:09,034
Because you're
a regular guy.

1585
01:29:10,474 --> 01:29:13,875
Yep, that's why I want you
to stay regular.

1586
01:29:15,012 --> 01:29:19,813
1/2 teaspoon for fast,
effective relief.

1587
01:29:23,554 --> 01:29:27,115
( whistling )

1588
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:33,122
( laughing )

1589
01:29:35,165 --> 01:29:37,565
Mmm!

1590
01:29:37,601 --> 01:29:40,468
( "Auld Lang Syne"
playing )

1591
01:29:40,504 --> 01:29:44,600
To my friend Harry...
the matchmaker.

1592
01:29:44,642 --> 01:29:48,100
Oh, get out of here.
I'm-- I've--

1593
01:29:50,915 --> 01:29:52,849
Mmm.

1594
01:29:52,883 --> 01:29:55,716
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

1595
01:29:55,753 --> 01:29:58,221
Mmm.

1596
01:30:07,998 --> 01:30:11,161
( stomach rumbles )

1597
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:14,470
( doorbell rings )

1598
01:30:14,505 --> 01:30:17,269
Mary: Hi, the door's open.
Come on upstairs.

1599
01:30:22,546 --> 01:30:23,979
- Hi.
- Hi.

1600
01:30:24,014 --> 01:30:25,641
Hi, make yourself
at home, okay?

1601
01:30:25,683 --> 01:30:27,150
I'm almost ready.
One minute?

1602
01:30:27,184 --> 01:30:29,709
- Okay, sounds good.
- Okay.

1603
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:42,863
( stomach violently
gurgling )

1604
01:31:04,622 --> 01:31:07,819
( loud sputtering )

1605
01:31:08,826 --> 01:31:11,920
( trills )

1606
01:31:24,908 --> 01:31:27,570
( sputtering continues )

1607
01:31:27,611 --> 01:31:29,579
( sighs )

1608
01:31:29,613 --> 01:31:31,945
( chuckles )

1609
01:31:36,553 --> 01:31:39,454
( panting )

1610
01:31:51,669 --> 01:31:53,136
( knocks )

1611
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:55,934
Mary: Harry, are you
in there?

1612
01:31:55,973 --> 01:31:57,964
Be right out!

1613
01:31:58,008 --> 01:32:01,774
I hope you're not using the toilet.
It's broken.

1614
01:32:01,812 --> 01:32:04,872
( ominous music plays )

1615
01:32:04,915 --> 01:32:08,612
- Huh?
- The toilet doesn't flush.

1616
01:32:08,652 --> 01:32:10,847
No, I was
just shaving.

1617
01:32:10,888 --> 01:32:13,083
Shaving?

1618
01:32:13,123 --> 01:32:15,648
Yeah, I was running
a little late.

1619
01:32:15,693 --> 01:32:18,161
I thought this
would save some time.

1620
01:32:20,164 --> 01:32:24,396
Okay well, I'll be in the kitchen
whenever you're ready.

1621
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:29,632
Oh, Jeez!

1622
01:32:29,673 --> 01:32:32,309
- ( laughing maniacally )
- ( whimsical music playing )

1623
01:32:32,309 --> 01:32:33,401
- ( laughing maniacally )
- ( whimsical music playing )

1624
01:32:44,888 --> 01:32:46,719
Tomorrow on
"A Current Affair,"

1625
01:32:46,757 --> 01:32:49,317
inside the home of the Menendez
brothers' attorney.

1626
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:51,589
And next, we'll be
back in a minute

1627
01:32:51,628 --> 01:32:56,031
with the heartbreaking story
of the blind Rhode lsland boy

1628
01:32:56,066 --> 01:32:59,001
who was duped into
buying a dead parakeet.

1629
01:32:59,036 --> 01:33:02,199
I just thought
he was real quiet.

1630
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,673
Who are these
sick people?

1631
01:33:08,712 --> 01:33:10,543
( doorbell rings )

1632
01:33:13,784 --> 01:33:15,843
- Hi!
- Hi.

1633
01:33:15,886 --> 01:33:17,945
Yes?

1634
01:33:17,988 --> 01:33:19,683
Remember me?

1635
01:33:20,691 --> 01:33:23,922
Uh... not really.

1636
01:33:23,961 --> 01:33:27,920
Providen--
Providence.

1637
01:33:27,965 --> 01:33:29,990
I drove you
to the airport last week.

1638
01:33:30,033 --> 01:33:31,898
Oh my God!

1639
01:33:31,935 --> 01:33:34,665
Uh... Lloyd, right?

1640
01:33:34,705 --> 01:33:38,266
You remembered
my name.

1641
01:33:38,308 --> 01:33:40,708
What are you doing
in Aspen?

1642
01:33:40,744 --> 01:33:42,336
I brought you
your briefcase.

1643
01:33:42,379 --> 01:33:46,110
You left it at the airport,
you big goof!

1644
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:48,983
- You have my briefcase?
- Yeah.

1645
01:33:49,019 --> 01:33:51,146
Hey, I have it
at my hotel room.

1646
01:33:51,188 --> 01:33:53,850
You want to jump on the bike with me?
We can go get it

1647
01:33:53,891 --> 01:33:57,349
unless...
unless you're busy.

1648
01:33:57,394 --> 01:33:59,328
Oh, no no no!
No no!

1649
01:33:59,363 --> 01:34:01,228
- I don't wanna--
- You just wait right here.

1650
01:34:01,265 --> 01:34:02,960
- Okay.
- Okay?

1651
01:34:07,805 --> 01:34:10,296
Come on, flush,
you bastard!

1652
01:34:13,911 --> 01:34:16,243
Mary: Harry, what are
you doing in there?

1653
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:21,650
- I'm just-- I'm cleaning my teeth!
- ( clattering )

1654
01:34:34,965 --> 01:34:36,626
I'm cleaning my teeth.

1655
01:34:38,101 --> 01:34:40,262
I'm gargling.

1656
01:34:40,304 --> 01:34:42,966
Just give me a minute, Mary.
I'll be right with you.

1657
01:34:43,006 --> 01:34:45,304
Harry, I'm sorry, but something
important's come up,

1658
01:34:45,342 --> 01:34:47,242
and I've got
to run out.

1659
01:34:47,277 --> 01:34:50,110
It's-it's sort of an emergency.
I'll explain later.

1660
01:34:50,147 --> 01:34:53,776
- But, Mary--
- I'm sorry. I've really got to go.

1661
01:34:53,817 --> 01:34:56,149
I promise we'll do this
again sometime.

1662
01:35:07,431 --> 01:35:09,763
Race you to the top.

1663
01:35:11,435 --> 01:35:14,427
- Come here.
- Agh!

1664
01:35:17,241 --> 01:35:20,768
Yeah! Ha ha!

1665
01:35:21,945 --> 01:35:23,469
I won!

1666
01:35:23,513 --> 01:35:26,277
Look familiar?

1667
01:35:26,316 --> 01:35:28,216
I don't believe it.
You really have it.

1668
01:35:28,252 --> 01:35:30,049
Of course, I have it.

1669
01:35:30,087 --> 01:35:32,351
When Lloyd Christmas
drives a woman to the airport,

1670
01:35:32,389 --> 01:35:34,152
he makes sure she gets
all her luggage.

1671
01:35:34,191 --> 01:35:37,217
- That's my whole philosophy.
- This is incredible.

1672
01:35:37,261 --> 01:35:40,025
You mean to say
you drove 2,000 miles

1673
01:35:40,063 --> 01:35:42,497
just for me?

1674
01:35:42,532 --> 01:35:47,595
Uh... I didn't really
have a lot to do.

1675
01:35:49,006 --> 01:35:50,871
And I know how
frustrating it can be

1676
01:35:50,908 --> 01:35:53,001
to lose a bag.

1677
01:35:53,043 --> 01:35:56,206
That is so sweet, Lloyd.

1678
01:35:56,246 --> 01:35:58,510
( kisses )

1679
01:35:58,548 --> 01:36:02,075
( romantic pop music
playing )

1680
01:36:10,594 --> 01:36:13,893
Look, Mary, I know this may
seem a little sudden,

1681
01:36:13,931 --> 01:36:16,024
but I've given it
a lot of thought.

1682
01:36:16,066 --> 01:36:19,194
You're the woman I've been waiting
for my whole life,

1683
01:36:19,236 --> 01:36:20,999
and I'm not ashamed
to admit it.

1684
01:36:21,038 --> 01:36:25,168
Please...
Let me finish.

1685
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:28,507
I'm crazy about you.

1686
01:36:28,545 --> 01:36:31,412
I've never felt this way
about anybody.

1687
01:36:31,448 --> 01:36:34,178
Listen to me.

1688
01:36:34,217 --> 01:36:37,209
I feel like
a schoolboy again,

1689
01:36:37,254 --> 01:36:40,018
a schoolboy
who desperately wants

1690
01:36:40,057 --> 01:36:42,787
to make sweet
sweet love to you.

1691
01:36:52,202 --> 01:36:55,831
Oh, I thought I heard
you talking to someone.

1692
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:01,841
Mary, l-l--

1693
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:10,351
I desperately want to make love
to a schoolboy.

1694
01:37:11,588 --> 01:37:14,421
- Maybe I should be going.
- No no...

1695
01:37:14,458 --> 01:37:16,323
( stutters )

1696
01:37:16,360 --> 01:37:19,329
No, l-- that's not
what I meant.

1697
01:37:22,332 --> 01:37:27,235
Um... what l
meant was, um...

1698
01:37:29,373 --> 01:37:31,273
God.

1699
01:37:31,308 --> 01:37:34,300
I-I like you, Mary.

1700
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:40,309
I like you a lot.

1701
01:37:41,618 --> 01:37:46,248
I want to ask you a question
straight out, flat out,

1702
01:37:46,289 --> 01:37:48,621
and I want you to give me
an honest answer.

1703
01:37:48,658 --> 01:37:51,092
What do you think
the chances are

1704
01:37:51,128 --> 01:37:55,189
of a guy like you
and a girl like me...

1705
01:37:56,633 --> 01:37:58,931
ending up together?

1706
01:37:58,969 --> 01:38:01,301
Well, Lloyd,
that's difficult to say.

1707
01:38:01,338 --> 01:38:04,034
We really don't--

1708
01:38:04,107 --> 01:38:06,667
Hit me with it!
Just give it to me straight!

1709
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,940
I came a long way
just to see you, Mary.

1710
01:38:08,979 --> 01:38:11,504
Just-- the least you can do
is level with me.

1711
01:38:11,548 --> 01:38:13,948
What are my chances?

1712
01:38:13,984 --> 01:38:16,509
Not good.

1713
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:24,984
You mean not good,
like one out of 100?

1714
01:38:25,028 --> 01:38:29,397
I'd say more like
one out of a million.

1715
01:38:34,704 --> 01:38:38,572
So you're telling me
there's a chance!

1716
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:42,803
Yeah!

1717
01:38:44,414 --> 01:38:46,382
I read you.

1718
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,441
( knocks )

1719
01:38:53,423 --> 01:38:56,392
Hi. We have plenty
of towels. Thanks.

1720
01:38:56,426 --> 01:38:59,259
Nicholas!
What are you doing here?

1721
01:38:59,296 --> 01:39:00,991
I've been looking
for you, Mary.

1722
01:39:01,031 --> 01:39:03,022
I have some news
about your husband.

1723
01:39:04,267 --> 01:39:07,634
Husband?!
Wait a minute!

1724
01:39:09,239 --> 01:39:13,005
What was all that
one-in-a-million talk?

1725
01:39:13,043 --> 01:39:15,841
Aren't you going to
invite me in?

1726
01:39:20,817 --> 01:39:24,514
Beth: Hey, Harry,
you never called!

1727
01:39:24,554 --> 01:39:26,488
What are you doing here?

1728
01:39:30,494 --> 01:39:33,588
Excuse me, gunman,
who are you?

1729
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:35,655
Don't play dumb
with me, asshole!

1730
01:39:35,699 --> 01:39:38,566
I'm the rightful owner of that briefcase
you've been carrying around!

1731
01:39:38,602 --> 01:39:40,729
Oh. Well, then...

1732
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:44,797
Nicholas, my family
trusted you.

1733
01:39:44,841 --> 01:39:47,036
Shut up!

1734
01:39:47,077 --> 01:39:51,070
Listen, Mr. Samsonite,
about the briefcase--

1735
01:39:51,114 --> 01:39:53,139
my friend Harry and l
have every intention

1736
01:39:53,183 --> 01:39:55,743
- of fully reimbursing you.
- What?

1737
01:39:55,785 --> 01:39:59,312
You open it up.
Open it up!

1738
01:39:59,356 --> 01:40:02,189
Go ahead, open it up.
Do what he says.

1739
01:40:02,225 --> 01:40:03,988
Hurry.

1740
01:40:08,865 --> 01:40:11,356
What is this?
What is this?

1741
01:40:11,401 --> 01:40:13,096
Where's all the money?

1742
01:40:13,136 --> 01:40:16,071
That's as good
as money, sir.

1743
01:40:16,106 --> 01:40:18,597
Those are lOUs.
Go ahead and add it up.

1744
01:40:18,642 --> 01:40:20,576
Every cent's
accounted for.

1745
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:23,545
Look. See this?

1746
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,844
That's a car.
275 thou.

1747
01:40:25,882 --> 01:40:28,043
Might want to hang on
to that one.

1748
01:40:31,855 --> 01:40:34,881
You're a dead man.
You're a dead man!

1749
01:40:39,863 --> 01:40:42,798
Lloyd, I'm home!

1750
01:40:42,832 --> 01:40:46,131
Look, we've got to have
a serious talk.

1751
01:40:46,169 --> 01:40:47,693
I got a confession
to make.

1752
01:40:47,737 --> 01:40:49,568
Oh, good.
You found her.

1753
01:40:49,606 --> 01:40:51,164
I'll leave
you two alone.

1754
01:40:51,208 --> 01:40:53,403
No. Stay.

1755
01:40:54,411 --> 01:40:56,379
Ugh!

1756
01:40:59,849 --> 01:41:02,841
Yes, I'd like a one-way ticket
to Amsterdam

1757
01:41:02,886 --> 01:41:05,582
departing as soon
as possible, please.

1758
01:41:05,622 --> 01:41:08,216
How do you guys
know each other?

1759
01:41:08,258 --> 01:41:10,192
We used to be
best friends.

1760
01:41:10,227 --> 01:41:12,195
Yeah, until he turned
into a backstabber.

1761
01:41:12,229 --> 01:41:15,255
Me a backstabber?
You got a lot of nerve.

1762
01:41:15,298 --> 01:41:17,129
You knew I was
crazy about her!

1763
01:41:17,167 --> 01:41:19,465
And you knew I was crazy
about Fraida Felcher,

1764
01:41:19,502 --> 01:41:22,903
- and that didn't stop you, did it?
- ( gasps )

1765
01:41:22,939 --> 01:41:25,237
- What do you mean?
- ( mimics ) What do you mean?

1766
01:41:25,275 --> 01:41:27,175
Don't deny it, Lloyd.

1767
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:30,475
Fraida told me the whole sleazy story,
Mr. French Tickler.

1768
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:35,875
Okay, what time does it--
what time does that leave?

1769
01:41:35,919 --> 01:41:37,887
Thank you--
wait a second.

1770
01:41:37,921 --> 01:41:39,855
Can I have
a vegetarian meal?

1771
01:41:39,889 --> 01:41:42,289
I guess we both learned
a little something

1772
01:41:42,325 --> 01:41:44,793
- about each other today, didn't we?
- Yeah, you said it, pal.

1773
01:41:44,828 --> 01:41:46,489
Maybe we're not as good of
friends as we thought we were.

1774
01:41:46,529 --> 01:41:47,461
I guess not.

1775
01:41:47,497 --> 01:41:50,364
I mean, if one beautiful girl
can rip us apart like this,

1776
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,391
then maybe our friendship
isn't worth a damn.

1777
01:41:52,435 --> 01:41:53,868
Maybe we should
call it quits right now.

1778
01:41:53,903 --> 01:41:55,871
You just tell me
where to sign, bud.

1779
01:41:55,905 --> 01:41:57,896
Right on my ass
after you kiss it!

1780
01:41:57,941 --> 01:41:59,533
Kiss it?!
You kiss mine!

1781
01:41:59,576 --> 01:42:01,737
Both cheeks, both lips,
right here!

1782
01:42:01,778 --> 01:42:05,737
- Put it right--
- Shut up!

1783
01:42:07,751 --> 01:42:10,481
Now, which one of you losers
wants to get it first?

1784
01:42:11,955 --> 01:42:14,515
Over here...

1785
01:42:14,557 --> 01:42:16,957
I was the one that got you into
this whole mess.

1786
01:42:16,993 --> 01:42:19,291
Come on
and shoot me.

1787
01:42:19,329 --> 01:42:22,355
No! Wait! Wait.
No no, do me first.

1788
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:24,492
I stole your girl, Lloyd.
I deserve it.

1789
01:42:24,534 --> 01:42:25,967
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1790
01:42:26,002 --> 01:42:28,197
- No, you don't--
- Yes, I do!

1791
01:42:28,238 --> 01:42:30,604
Yesterday was one of the greatest
days of my life.

1792
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:34,770
Mary and I went skiing, we made
a snowman, she touched my leg.

1793
01:42:34,811 --> 01:42:37,177
Okay, kill him!

1794
01:42:43,653 --> 01:42:46,053
( sobbing )
Oh! Oh, no!

1795
01:42:47,524 --> 01:42:50,789
You killed my best friend,
you bastard!

1796
01:42:50,827 --> 01:42:52,454
If it's any consolation,

1797
01:42:52,495 --> 01:42:54,656
you're about
to be reunited.

1798
01:42:58,802 --> 01:43:00,736
( gun clicking )

1799
01:43:00,770 --> 01:43:04,672
Harry!
You're alive!

1800
01:43:04,708 --> 01:43:07,404
And you're
a horrible shot.

1801
01:43:07,444 --> 01:43:09,503
Lucky me.

1802
01:43:09,546 --> 01:43:12,014
Police! Open up!
Nobody move!

1803
01:43:12,048 --> 01:43:15,415
Everybody freeze!
Get those hands up!

1804
01:43:15,452 --> 01:43:16,942
Not you, dummy!

1805
01:43:16,986 --> 01:43:18,544
Man:
Get the gun.

1806
01:43:18,588 --> 01:43:21,284
Special Officer
Beth Jordan, FBl.

1807
01:43:21,324 --> 01:43:22,882
Hey! Who?
But-- huh?

1808
01:43:22,926 --> 01:43:24,860
Mr. Dunne,
thank you very much.

1809
01:43:24,894 --> 01:43:27,863
We couldn't have
done it without you.

1810
01:43:27,897 --> 01:43:29,421
We've been
following you guys

1811
01:43:29,466 --> 01:43:30,797
all the way
from Providence.

1812
01:43:30,834 --> 01:43:32,631
What's going on,
Harry?

1813
01:43:32,669 --> 01:43:35,968
Your name is Harry,
isn't it?

1814
01:43:36,005 --> 01:43:39,532
Yeah, she-she grabbed me down the lobby,
explained what was up.

1815
01:43:39,576 --> 01:43:41,669
Then they slapped
this bulletproof vest on me

1816
01:43:41,711 --> 01:43:43,838
and gave me a gun.

1817
01:43:45,615 --> 01:43:47,981
But what if he shot you
in the face?

1818
01:43:49,052 --> 01:43:51,452
What if he shot me
in the face?

1819
01:43:51,488 --> 01:43:53,786
That's a risk
we were willing to take.

1820
01:43:53,823 --> 01:43:55,688
How come I didn't
get a gun?

1821
01:43:55,725 --> 01:43:57,989
Did you
get a gun?

1822
01:43:58,027 --> 01:44:02,657
# We can't play
this game anymore #

1823
01:44:02,699 --> 01:44:07,329
# But can we still
be friends? #

1824
01:44:08,972 --> 01:44:13,739
# Things just can't
go on like before #

1825
01:44:13,777 --> 01:44:18,441
# But can we still
be friends? #

1826
01:44:18,481 --> 01:44:23,942
# We had something
to learn #

1827
01:44:23,987 --> 01:44:25,955
# Now it's time... #

1828
01:44:25,989 --> 01:44:27,889
You were right,
Lloyd.

1829
01:44:27,924 --> 01:44:29,983
She was definitely
worth the trip.

1830
01:44:30,026 --> 01:44:34,554
Yeah. She's something,
ain't she, Harr?

1831
01:44:34,597 --> 01:44:36,462
I'm glad we were able
to help her out.

1832
01:44:36,499 --> 01:44:42,369
# You know
it's all gone #

1833
01:44:42,405 --> 01:44:46,341
# Let's admit
we made a mistake... #

1834
01:44:46,376 --> 01:44:48,105
- Honey!
- Easy easy.

1835
01:44:48,144 --> 01:44:50,510
- You're okay.
- Okay, I'm just a little sore.

1836
01:44:50,547 --> 01:44:53,414
I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie.

1837
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:55,714
Oh, baby, I missed
your loving.

1838
01:44:55,752 --> 01:44:58,016
Honey, there's someone
I want to introduce you to.

1839
01:44:58,054 --> 01:45:00,488
He's the kindest,
gentlest man I've ever met.

1840
01:45:00,523 --> 01:45:02,354
- Will you meet him?
- Sure.

1841
01:45:02,392 --> 01:45:04,758
He's got a gun!

1842
01:45:07,464 --> 01:45:10,365
Mary:
Lloyd? Lloyd!

1843
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,368
Huh?

1844
01:45:12,402 --> 01:45:15,496
I said this is
my husband Bobby.

1845
01:45:15,538 --> 01:45:18,530
- Oh. Hi, Bobby.
- Hi.

1846
01:45:18,575 --> 01:45:23,069
- I'm so happy for you.
- Thank you.

1847
01:45:23,112 --> 01:45:25,945
Thank you both
very much.

1848
01:45:25,982 --> 01:45:29,577
I owe you both
a debt of gratitude.

1849
01:45:29,619 --> 01:45:31,382
Thank you.

1850
01:45:50,473 --> 01:45:52,941
I can't believe
this, Lloyd.

1851
01:45:52,976 --> 01:45:54,876
First Mary dumps us,

1852
01:45:54,911 --> 01:45:56,845
then the cops take
our nest egg.

1853
01:45:56,880 --> 01:45:58,973
- Then our hog breaks down.
- Yeah!

1854
01:45:59,015 --> 01:46:02,143
When are we ever
gonna catch a break?

1855
01:46:03,953 --> 01:46:06,478
# Hallelujah #

1856
01:46:06,523 --> 01:46:08,616
# Hallelujah #

1857
01:46:08,658 --> 01:46:10,956
# Hallelujah
hallelujah #

1858
01:46:10,994 --> 01:46:13,258
# Hallelujah. #

1859
01:46:15,698 --> 01:46:19,634
- Hi, y'all.
- ( speaking foreign language )

1860
01:46:19,669 --> 01:46:21,830
Hi, guys! We're going
on a national bikini tour,

1861
01:46:21,871 --> 01:46:23,600
and we're looking for
two oil boys

1862
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:26,006
who can grease us up
before each competition.

1863
01:46:30,213 --> 01:46:32,738
You are in luck!

1864
01:46:32,782 --> 01:46:36,047
There's a town about
three miles that way.

1865
01:46:36,085 --> 01:46:38,349
I'm sure you'll find
a couple guys there.

1866
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:43,615
Okay. Thanks.

1867
01:46:43,660 --> 01:46:45,753
Bye!

1868
01:46:52,869 --> 01:46:55,497
Do you realize
what you've done?

1869
01:46:55,538 --> 01:46:59,167
- Hey!
- Lloyd!

1870
01:46:59,208 --> 01:47:01,870
Lloyd!

1871
01:47:09,586 --> 01:47:11,884
You'll have to
excuse my friend.

1872
01:47:11,921 --> 01:47:14,890
He's a little slow.

1873
01:47:14,924 --> 01:47:18,018
The town is
back that way.

1874
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:29,194
Wow.

1875
01:47:29,238 --> 01:47:31,138
Two lucky guys

1876
01:47:31,174 --> 01:47:33,267
are gonna be driving around
with those girls

1877
01:47:33,309 --> 01:47:35,174
for the next
couple of months.

1878
01:47:35,211 --> 01:47:37,873
Yeah, don't worry.

1879
01:47:37,914 --> 01:47:39,745
We'll catch
our break too.

1880
01:47:39,782 --> 01:47:43,274
- Just gotta keep our eyes open.
- Yeah.

1881
01:47:43,319 --> 01:47:43,853
# Now, we've been
friends forever... #

1882
01:47:43,853 --> 01:47:46,185
# Now, we've been
friends forever... #

1883
01:47:46,222 --> 01:47:48,918
- You're it.
- You're it.

1884
01:47:48,958 --> 01:47:50,687
You're it.
Quitsies.

1885
01:47:50,727 --> 01:47:52,695
You're it. Anti-quitsies,
double-stamp.

1886
01:47:52,729 --> 01:47:55,254
You're it. Anti-quitsies,
triple-stamp.

1887
01:47:55,298 --> 01:47:57,289
- No erasies, none at all.
- You can't triple-stamp.

1888
01:47:57,333 --> 01:47:59,563
Yes, if you have a double-stamp,
of course you can.

1889
01:47:59,602 --> 01:48:01,160
- You can't triple-stamp!
- # La la la la la... #

1890
01:48:01,204 --> 01:48:03,172
You can't if you
have a double-stamp!

1891
01:48:03,206 --> 01:48:04,969
You can't triple-stamp--
the rule!

1892
01:48:05,008 --> 01:48:08,967
You can't triple-stamp
a double-stamp, Lloyd!

1893
01:48:09,012 --> 01:48:11,845
Lloyd! Lloyd!

1894
01:48:13,082 --> 01:48:16,984
# And now we're rolling
down the hill #

1895
01:48:18,888 --> 01:48:21,152
# Down the hill. #

1896
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:27,623
# Here you go,
way too fast #

1897
01:48:27,664 --> 01:48:29,996
# Don't slow down,
you're gonna crash #

1898
01:48:30,033 --> 01:48:33,127
# You should watch,
watch your step #

1899
01:48:33,169 --> 01:48:35,694
# Don't look out,
gonna break your neck #

1900
01:48:35,738 --> 01:48:38,866
# So shut,
shut your mouth #

1901
01:48:38,908 --> 01:48:41,274
# 'Cause I'm not
listenin' anyhow #

1902
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:44,336
# I had enough,
enough of you #

1903
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:47,076
# Enough to last
a lifetime through #

1904
01:48:47,116 --> 01:48:50,108
# So what do you
want of me? #

1905
01:48:50,153 --> 01:48:52,951
# Got no words
of sympathy #

1906
01:48:52,989 --> 01:48:55,651
# And if I go
around with you #

1907
01:48:55,692 --> 01:48:59,628
# You know that I'll get
messed up too with you #

1908
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:08,564
# Na-na-na-na-na,
na-na-na-na-na #

1909
01:49:10,039 --> 01:49:14,772
# Na-na-na-na-na,
na-na-na-na-na #

1910
01:49:14,811 --> 01:49:18,338
# Here you go,
way too fast #

1911
01:49:18,381 --> 01:49:20,906
# Don't slow down,
you're gonna crash #

1912
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:23,885
# You don't know
what's been going down #

1913
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:26,388
# You've been runnin'
all over town #

1914
01:49:26,422 --> 01:49:29,619
# So shut,
shut your mouth #

1915
01:49:29,659 --> 01:49:32,059
# 'Cause I'm not
listening anyhow #

1916
01:49:32,095 --> 01:49:35,189
# I've had enough,
enough of you #

1917
01:49:35,231 --> 01:49:37,961
# Enough to last
a lifetime through #

1918
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,026
# So what do you
want of me?

1919
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:43,800
# Got no cure
for misery #

1920
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,400
# And if I go
around with you #

1921
01:49:46,442 --> 01:49:49,138
# You know that
I'll get messed up too #

1922
01:49:49,178 --> 01:49:51,976
# With you #

1923
01:49:52,014 --> 01:49:55,108
# With you #

1924
01:49:55,151 --> 01:49:58,416
# Na-na-na-na-na,
na-na-na-na-na #

1925
01:49:58,454 --> 01:50:00,752
- # Slow down #
- # You're gonna crash #

1926
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:04,123
# Na-na-na-na-na,
na-na-na-na-na #

1927
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:06,526
- # Slow down #
- # You're gonna crash #

1928
01:50:23,146 --> 01:50:26,138
# With you #

1929
01:50:26,182 --> 01:50:28,810
# With you #

1930
01:50:28,851 --> 01:50:32,309
# Na-na-na-na-na,
na-na-na-na-na #

1931
01:50:32,355 --> 01:50:34,687
- # Slow down #
- # You're gonna crash #

1932
01:50:34,724 --> 01:50:37,989
# Na-na-na-na-na,
na-na-na-na-na #

1933
01:50:38,027 --> 01:50:40,257
- # Slow down #
- # You're gonna crash #

1934
01:50:40,296 --> 01:50:43,697
# Na-na-na-na-na,
na-na-na-na-na #

1935
01:50:43,733 --> 01:50:46,327
- # Slow down #
- # You're gonna crash. #

1936
01:51:09,859 --> 01:51:13,761
# Well, if you want,
I'll be by your side #

1937
01:51:13,796 --> 01:51:17,732
# And if you don't,
maybe suicide #

1938
01:51:17,767 --> 01:51:21,203
# It's my love
that'd kill me, dear #

1939
01:51:21,237 --> 01:51:24,934
# If you won't hold me
and have me near #

1940
01:51:24,974 --> 01:51:28,501
# Because I'll be good
to you in every way #

1941
01:51:28,544 --> 01:51:32,310
# I'll give you lovin',
baby, every day #

1942
01:51:32,348 --> 01:51:35,943
# A lovin' that's good,
a lovin' that's all right #

1943
01:51:35,985 --> 01:51:39,079
# A lovin' like an oven
on the coldest night #

1944
01:51:39,121 --> 01:51:41,316
# Whoo! #

1945
01:51:53,903 --> 01:51:58,203
# 'Cause if you don't love me,
I'll kill myself #

1946
01:52:01,277 --> 01:52:05,680
# Yeah, if you don't love me,
I'll kill myself #

1947
01:52:08,484 --> 01:52:12,511
# If you don't love me,
I'll kill myself #

1948
01:52:15,825 --> 01:52:20,159
# If you don't love me,
I'll kill myself. #
