1
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,145
Straight through there and
to the left

2
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:47,584
Would you like to...

3
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,033
- Who's this?
- Pardon me?

4
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:11,004
That's not my father.

5
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:16,721
Shit, we've taken the wrong one.

6
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,490
We're really sorry for this.
We'll go back and get him.

7
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:29,394
Jesus...

8
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:55,363
They brought the wrong coffin.

9
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,811
You're joking.

10
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:01,402
Can you believe that?
Good thing I checked.

11
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,706
We could be running the service for
some random member of the public.

12
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,238
What kind of business are these people
running anyway?

13
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:08,704
My God.

14
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:11,359
There's just so much to worry about
you know. And Mom's in such a state...

15
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:13,653
Robert is clear he'll not do anything to
help, assuming he gets here at all.

16
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:15,433
Even the funeral speech is awful.

17
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:16,810
I'm sure it's not that awful.

18
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,910
Yeah, it is.

19
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:20,719
I was thinking that maybe Robert...

20
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,222
..should write the speech.
He's such a good writer.

21
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,296
Maybe we should
let him do it.

22
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:26,378
You're every bit as good a writer as
your brother Daniel, if not better,...

23
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:29,393
...you just have to let somebody
else read your novel.

24
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:31,873
Everything is gonna be okay.

25
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:33,742
When the funeral is over...

26
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:36,063
...we just have to focus on
moving out of here...

27
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:39,393
...and starting our own
lives properly.

28
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:43,761
You called them?

29
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,583
Didn't you, Daniel?

30
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:47,549
You did put the deposit
on the flat?

31
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:49,944
I'll sort it out.
I promise.

32
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:56,159
God, I hate funerals.
Don't you?

33
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:58,554
They're just so depressing.

34
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,326
It's just the death and
everything...

35
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,959
...know what I mean?
Do you agree, Justin?

36
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:03,720
Justin?

37
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
Yeah, it's alright

38
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,003
Alright? How can you possibly think
of that as alright?

39
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,034
Why are you even coming to this?
You don't even know Daniel.

40
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:15,000
I do know Daniel.
I met him a couple of times.

41
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,999
A couple of times. Well he's not
a friend, is he?

42
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:18,598
No, not a friend.

43
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:21,496
If you're gonna smoke will you please
put that out the window?

44
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:24,694
I'd rather not get your cancer
thank you very much.

45
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:27,326
I got my own problems to be
worrying about.

46
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:28,826
Yeah, like what?

47
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:32,428
The discoloration on my wrist
I keep telling you about.

48
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:33,723
Look at it.

49
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:35,189
It's fucked.

50
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:37,289
I'm fucked.

51
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:41,868
Why are we even coming, eh?

52
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,979
Cause of Martha, isn't it?

53
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:49,215
Justin...

54
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:52,513
Are you okay?

55
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,908
Not too bad, thanks Martha.

56
00:06:55,044 --> 00:06:57,044
I'm a bit nervous.

57
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,409
About seeing my Dad?

58
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,107
I just don't think I've been so
openly hated by anyone before.

59
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:05,205
He just hates everyone.
You mustn't take it to heart.

60
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:07,104
You need to relax with him.

61
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:09,402
I can't help it.
He puts me on edge.

62
00:07:09,502 --> 00:07:11,450
He'll be more concerned his sister
husband just died.

63
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,234
He's not gonna be focused
on you.

64
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:17,098
Anyway, I'm sure when I tell him
that we're getting married...

65
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:18,898
...He'll start to learn
to accept you.

66
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:20,150
Are you sure about that?

67
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,227
Of course.

68
00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:25,322
I can't really see Victor
as the accepting type.

69
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:31,161
We're on our way to
a funeral you wanker!

70
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:33,591
Haven't you got any respect?

71
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:35,689
Okay, calm down.

72
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,520
It's all right, breathe.

73
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,627
Through your nose.
Okay?

74
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:40,785
Deep breaths.

75
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:42,274
You alright?

76
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,374
That fucking...

77
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:54,719
Alright, I'm gonna go down.

78
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,510
Hope they brought the right
coffin this time.

79
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,509
I'll come with you.

80
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:58,509
It's okay, I can do it.

81
00:07:58,609 --> 00:07:59,305
I know, I know you can.

82
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,032
I'm just gonna check on
the seats.

83
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:03,107
To make sure there's enough room
for Uncle Alfie.

84
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,207
Shit.

85
00:08:07,304 --> 00:08:09,036
Hello?

86
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:11,634
Hey mate. How are you?
You alright?

87
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:13,101
Yeah.

88
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,921
Of course I remember
Uncle Alfie.

89
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,430
Absolutely fine.
Yeah, not a problem at all.

90
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,393
No. Of course I don't mind.

91
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:25,077
Alright. Yeah, don't worry.

92
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:26,493
It's fine.
I promise.

93
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,593
See you soon.
Okay, bye.

94
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,792
Shit.

95
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:47,493
Is this...your father sir?

96
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,412
Yes, it is yes.

97
00:09:05,604 --> 00:09:07,604
Hey mum.
You alright?

98
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:10,388
I just don't know what I'm
going to do without him.

99
00:09:10,488 --> 00:09:12,034
What do I have to live for now?

100
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,599
Don't be silly.
You got your friends, family...

101
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:16,598
You got me and Jane
and Robert...

102
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:17,898
Where is Robert?
Have you heard from him?

103
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:19,169
His plane will land at 10:00

104
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:20,496
But he'll be here.
Don't worry.

105
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:23,194
If there's anything I can do Sandra...

106
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:24,549
Don't put your hand there dear...

107
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:26,649
...you'll leave marks.

108
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:45,198
I'll get'em to you
this evening.

109
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:48,116
No, can't do it this afternoon.
I got a funeral.

110
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:49,425
Yeah, my uncle died.

111
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:51,059
Yeah, tragic.

112
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,484
I'm telling you mate.
This is really powerful stuff.

113
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:55,976
You really only need to take half.

114
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:59,673
Trust me. You're gonna
bite your fucking head off.

115
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,519
I gotta go.
My sister's in.

116
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:04,005
I'll tell you if I get to the bar
after the funeral.

117
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,105
Bye.

118
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,164
Hang on!

119
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,159
Hi. How's it going?

120
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,091
Troy you're not ready?
Come on, we're gonna be late.

121
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:30,941
I put on my trousers and
I'm done.

122
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:31,983
Are you guys okay?

123
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:33,023
Simon is a bit freaked out.

124
00:10:33,123 --> 00:10:35,439
Some asshole almost drove us
off the road.

125
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:39,352
Fucking bastards. Make yourselves comfy.
I'll be out in two minutes.

126
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:41,251
Look at these pills all
over the place.

127
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:43,649
Troy is studying to be
a pharmacist.

128
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:45,181
Are you okay?

129
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:46,766
I'm a bit shaky...

130
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,160
Not much, just a little...

131
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,577
Take one of these.

132
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:56,275
It will calm you down.

133
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,608
You sure?

134
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,707
Absolutely.
It's just Valium.

135
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,506
I used to take them all the time.

136
00:11:01,606 --> 00:11:03,971
It will make you feel better.
Honestly.

137
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:06,071
Come on. Open wide.

138
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,666
I'm ready.

139
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,958
Hello?

140
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:32,555
Hello?

141
00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:34,288
Robert?

142
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:36,287
Robert.

143
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:37,139
Hi, Mom.

144
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,136
Darling.

145
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:40,236
Happy to see you.

146
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:46,691
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

147
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,780
Hi Robert.

148
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,478
How are you?

149
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:51,378
Good.

150
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,175
How was your flight?

151
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:54,976
Great... There was a lot of turbulence
that was a bit worrying...

152
00:11:55,076 --> 00:11:57,251
That's the thing about 1st class.
It doesn't matter how much you pay...

153
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:57,865
for the ticket...

154
00:11:57,965 --> 00:12:02,300
...if the plane crushes we're
all gonna end up dead.

155
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,405
Sorry.

156
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:05,903
No, no, I'll go.

157
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:08,003
Don't worry.

158
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,867
Shit.

159
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:26,122
That's him.

160
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:31,917
Jesus, Howard. You didn't say he was
gonna be in a fucking wheelchair.

161
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,164
Uncle Alfie, hello.

162
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,714
We're here to take you
to the funeral.

163
00:12:45,814 --> 00:12:49,299
Where the fuck have you been?
You're late.

164
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,164
This is bloody grim, isn't it?

165
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:16,463
It's not supposed to be fun.

166
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,563
I know, but Jesus...

167
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:23,800
I feel like my heart has been wrenched
out of my ribcage.

168
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,579
It's awful.

169
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,200
Well, that's grief for you.

170
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,183
That's why I don't like
close relationships.

171
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:30,448
Too much emotion.

172
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:36,452
I'm just glad you're
gonna be here with Mom.

173
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:38,556
Yeah, well not for long.

174
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:40,829
Jane and I are moving out.

175
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,349
What about Mom?

176
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:45,314
Actually I was thinking
maybe she'd like to...

177
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:48,279
...to come with you to New York
for a bit.

178
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,069
Don't be ridiculous.
I can't take her to New York.

179
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:52,234
What am I gonna do with her?
Take her to parties?

180
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:53,264
We've already decided.

181
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:54,808
We're putting a deposit
in a flat.

182
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:56,829
- I'm gonna need money.
- What money?

183
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:59,240
Money for all this.
For the funeral.

184
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,772
You agreed to pay the half.

185
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:02,872
- Did I?
- Yeah.

186
00:14:04,004 --> 00:14:06,004
Yeah, so...

187
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:08,668
Yeah, I don't have it on me Daniel.

188
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:10,966
I can get it to you in a few... months.

189
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,275
A few months?
Robert, I need it now.

190
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,929
Can't happen.
I'm skinned.

191
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:16,999
What do you mean skinned?

192
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:19,389
You're a successful novelist
you live in New York...

193
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:21,016
...and you have a penthouse there.
What do you mean?

194
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:23,463
Do you have any idea how
much it costs for up-keeping it?

195
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,480
And besides this, I paid a fortune
to fly out here.

196
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,289
Do you know how much they charge for
1st class nowadays?

197
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:32,180
It's a fucking disgrace.

198
00:14:34,053 --> 00:14:36,518
So, poor old Uncle Eddie, eh?

199
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:37,931
Yes.

200
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:40,857
Did you ever meet Uncle Eddie, Simon?

201
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:42,848
Simon?

202
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,081
Was there a dog in here
just now?

203
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:47,181
What?

204
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,278
I'm sure there was a dog in here.

205
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:53,438
What the hell are you talking about?

206
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,860
There's nowhere to park.

207
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:14,873
This is ridiculous.

208
00:15:14,973 --> 00:15:15,959
How about over there?

209
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:18,059
The guy is coming out.

210
00:15:18,372 --> 00:15:18,962
Take it!

211
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,461
Alright!

212
00:15:20,561 --> 00:15:22,561
What are you doing?

213
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,291
Are you mental?

214
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:30,038
Sorry.

215
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,620
Excuse me.

216
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,932
Sorry...
Oh, hi Martha.

217
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,094
I was just about to park there
actually.

218
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:37,126
Are you a relative, Howard?

219
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:38,483
No, I'm not.
But...

220
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,583
Hey Martha.

221
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,050
Who's that?

222
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,710
What's happening?

223
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,976
Did you see that?
She barely even looked at me.

224
00:15:53,076 --> 00:15:54,708
I said what's happening?
Are we there?

225
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:56,864
Oh, my God. We got
Uncle Alfie in the car.

226
00:15:56,964 --> 00:16:01,071
I can't believe I forgot to say
I've got Uncle Alfie in the car.

227
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:03,418
Alright, keep your hair on!

228
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:05,569
What the hell is going on?

229
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:07,669
She barely even looked.

230
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:18,961
Very green here. Isn't it...?

231
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:21,359
Very green...

232
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,158
Simon, what the hell is
the matter with you?

233
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:25,957
What do you mean?

234
00:16:26,057 --> 00:16:28,856
You're talking about phantom dogs
and things being green...

235
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:30,655
What's going on?

236
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,755
I don't know...

237
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:43,772
Martha.

238
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,280
Is Simon normally like this?

239
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,572
Of course he's not normally
like this.

240
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,672
Something's not right.

241
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:53,329
Hello...

242
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,907
I think it must be the Valium.

243
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:02,804
The Valium?

244
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:04,170
Yes.

245
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,368
I gave him a Valium
from your flat.

246
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:09,358
I think he's just not
used to it...

247
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:11,933
Right.

248
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:16,962
Are you gonna get any closer?

249
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:19,161
You're going the wrong way.

250
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:21,087
Stop the car. I need to
speak to Martha.

251
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:22,077
What?

252
00:17:22,177 --> 00:17:24,387
I need to speak to Martha.

253
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,945
What about Alfie?
I need help with Uncle Alfie.

254
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,489
We're gonna be late!

255
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,629
Please, stop doing that.

256
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,050
Thank you for coming.
So good to see you.

257
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:44,447
It's so weird to be back here.
I feel so out of it.

258
00:17:44,547 --> 00:17:47,112
That's because you live in a different
country. You loose touch.

259
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:51,887
Who are all these people?
I don't recognise any of them.

260
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,986
Who's that guy?

261
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,206
I've no idea. Probably some friend
from dad's work.

262
00:17:57,306 --> 00:18:00,371
Are you telling me I have to pay for
this entire funeral on my own?

263
00:18:00,471 --> 00:18:02,400
Well, I can't draw money out of
thin air, Daniel.

264
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Jesus fucking Christ!

265
00:18:05,082 --> 00:18:06,925
Daniel.
How's everything going?

266
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:08,563
Fine, thanks Reverend Davis.

267
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:10,372
We're just waiting for everyone to
arrive and then we can start.

268
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:12,472
Great, thank you.

269
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:14,463
Have you met my brother Robert?

270
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:17,504
The writer of course.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

271
00:18:17,604 --> 00:18:19,286
I have read several of
your novels.

272
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:20,260
Really?

273
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,458
You must be very
proud of your brother.

274
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:23,657
Yeah, very proud.

275
00:18:23,757 --> 00:18:25,656
Will you be reading the
eulogy today?

276
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:28,136
No, Daniel is
going to do it.

277
00:18:29,535 --> 00:18:30,954
Great.

278
00:18:31,054 --> 00:18:34,794
I'll just make sure I have
everything I need.

279
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,992
Listen, I think you
should do the eulogy.

280
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:42,320
...everyone's expecting you to do it,
I'll just make a mess of it anyways.

281
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,545
Don't be silly.
You do it.

282
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:46,746
You'll be fine.

283
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:49,032
All these can go
through now.

284
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:50,796
How's my little sister?

285
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,275
That's very sad.

286
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,308
He was a wonderful husband
wasn't he?

287
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:56,408
So tender, so devoted.

288
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,472
Can I get you a cop of
tea, Sandra?

289
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,305
Tea can do many things, Jane.

290
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:03,125
But it can't bring back
the dead.

291
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,960
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

292
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:13,066
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

293
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:15,278
Daniel, have you called yet
about the deposit?

294
00:19:15,378 --> 00:19:16,250
No, I haven't.

295
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,108
Why don't you give me the number
and I can do it?

296
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:19,339
Jane, don't make a fuss.

297
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:21,259
Do you see that guy standing by
the table?

298
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,158
Do you recognise him at all?

299
00:19:23,258 --> 00:19:24,488
He's really staring at me.

300
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:26,178
Are you listening to me at all?

301
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:28,555
We have to put the deposit on the
flat, before it's too late.

302
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:29,292
I know.

303
00:19:29,392 --> 00:19:31,392
Alright?

304
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,670
You'll break it!

305
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:49,048
Hurry up, we're late.

306
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:52,046
Oh God...

307
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:56,601
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

308
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:57,865
..."My father was an
exceptional man"...

309
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,482
Kate has grown up a bit
isn't she?

310
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:00,137
What?

311
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:01,136
Katey.

312
00:20:01,236 --> 00:20:04,385
She was a little girl
when I left and now...

313
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:05,600
...she's fit.

314
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,433
I'm going to chat with her.

315
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:09,533
Yeah, why don't you?

316
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,730
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

317
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,429
Hello there.

318
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:17,529
Oh, hello.

319
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:21,867
I was really sorry to hear
about your father.

320
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:24,257
He always talked about you.

321
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,022
Said you were a good son.

322
00:20:26,122 --> 00:20:28,122
Thank you.

323
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:30,520
Did he ever mention me?

324
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,919
I'm Peter.

325
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:36,439
Peter... I don't think so.
Were you friends with Dad?

326
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,465
Nice to meet you and
thank you for coming.

327
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,432
Push the bloody thing...

328
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:53,296
I am damn it...

329
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:55,396
You're useless...

330
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:58,138
"My father was an
exceptional man"...

331
00:20:58,238 --> 00:20:58,971
Daniel.

332
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,007
I think we should be calling
everyone in, now...

333
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:01,967
...to start the service.

334
00:21:02,067 --> 00:21:02,665
Sure.

335
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:05,417
Really I'm only supposed to be
here until 3.

336
00:21:05,517 --> 00:21:07,629
Sure. Do you mind if we wait
5 minutes for my Uncle Alfie?

337
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:09,147
We shouldn't start without
him, if possible.

338
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,247
Sure.

339
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:26,622
Look.

340
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:28,722
Isn't it beautiful?

341
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:30,996
Martha. Can I have a word?

342
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:32,219
Excuse me.

343
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,934
Why?
What is it?

344
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:35,431
I have to tell you something.

345
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:39,215
I'm warning you in advance
you're not gonna like it.

346
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:40,873
Nice to see you.
Thank you for coming.

347
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:41,468
Daniel.

348
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:42,469
Uncle Victor.

349
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,112
Hello, Robert.

350
00:21:44,212 --> 00:21:45,778
Uncle Victor.
How are you?

351
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:47,770
I'm...

352
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,991
...sad.

353
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:49,743
I understand.

354
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,319
So, how are things in
New York?

355
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:52,874
Great. Really good.

356
00:21:52,974 --> 00:21:56,338
What's with this nonsense about you
not doing the eulogy?

357
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:58,221
That's right. Daniel is gonna
do the eulogy.

358
00:21:58,321 --> 00:21:59,937
Well that's a dams shame.

359
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:02,335
I mean, I'm sure Daniel will
be fine but...

360
00:22:02,435 --> 00:22:06,049
...after all you're the
writer in the family.

361
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,954
Will you just excuse me a second?

362
00:22:09,237 --> 00:22:10,193
So...

363
00:22:10,293 --> 00:22:11,838
...any new books coming out?

364
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:12,790
I'll get my things together.

365
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:13,962
Sure.

366
00:22:14,062 --> 00:22:15,628
You alright?

367
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:18,860
Every single bloody person
wants Robert to do the eulogy.

368
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,510
He's my father too,
isn't he?

369
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,259
I'm entitled to the
bloody eulogy.

370
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,359
Of course.

371
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:27,995
And it's gonna be the best bloody
eulogy anybody has ever heard.

372
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:28,775
Alright?

373
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:32,569
Looks like Robert won't
be doing the eulogy.

374
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:36,537
What did you just say?

375
00:22:36,637 --> 00:22:40,847
I said the Valium you gave Simon
wasn't actually a Valium.

376
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:43,893
It's a hallucinogenic concoction.

377
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:47,676
You know, stuff lice acid, mescaline,
a little smaller though.

378
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:48,743
This isn't funny Troy.

379
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:51,563
I'm not being funny.
Look at him.

380
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,651
You're absolutely stupid.

381
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,737
How can you leave stuff like
that, on your flat?

382
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,240
I didn't think that
someone will take it.

383
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,532
Who goes to someone else's flat
and take anything?

384
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,632
It was a Valium bottle.

385
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:07,032
Fuck, Troy.

386
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:08,831
What am I to do?

387
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:09,790
Should I tell him?

388
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,080
No! Don't do that.

389
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,063
You'll freak him out completely.

390
00:23:13,163 --> 00:23:15,103
We should keep a
very close eye on him.

391
00:23:15,203 --> 00:23:16,675
Make sure he doesn't get
out of control.

392
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:21,092
And don't let him spend too long
talking to one person.

393
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,192
Damn.

394
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,256
Hey Dad.
How are you doing?

395
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:40,054
You're late.

396
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:40,702
Hi Dad.

397
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:41,732
Hi Troy.

398
00:23:41,832 --> 00:23:43,245
You're missing University
today?

399
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,744
Nothing to worry.
I'll catch up.

400
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:47,143
I know.
I'm not worried about you.

401
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:49,142
I see you brought
your friend along.

402
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:51,235
His name is Simon.
Simon?

403
00:23:51,335 --> 00:23:53,773
Of course I brought him,
he's my boyfriend.

404
00:23:53,873 --> 00:23:56,168
Martha, so good to see you.

405
00:23:56,538 --> 00:23:59,536
I'm so sorry Aunt Sandra.
We'll miss Uncle Edward terribly.

406
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:01,235
Yeah, he was a great guy.

407
00:24:01,335 --> 00:24:03,062
Yes he was.

408
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:04,130
Simon, this is my...

409
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,966
Yeah absolutely...

410
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:08,653
So sorry about the death.

411
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,473
So sorry...

412
00:24:14,573 --> 00:24:15,864
Thank you.

413
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,964
...everything.

414
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:32,751
What are you gonna do?

415
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:34,091
No idea.

416
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:36,916
I can't leave. Aunt Sandra will
never speak to me again.

417
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:39,016
Shit.

418
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,513
Hey Martha.

419
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:00,532
You look nice.

420
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,733
I'm dressed for a funeral.

421
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,800
Yeah, but still...

422
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,565
I heard about the engagement.
What's that about?

423
00:25:07,665 --> 00:25:10,030
Who told you that?
I haven't even told my dad.

424
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,228
Is that the guy you're
gonna marry?

425
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:15,560
You're gonna spend the rest of
your life with him?

426
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,660
Yup, that's him.

427
00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:23,719
Simon?

428
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:25,819
Martha...

429
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,949
Come on!

430
00:25:31,818 --> 00:25:34,368
Can you give me a hand, Justin?

431
00:25:37,697 --> 00:25:39,697
Hi...Daniel.

432
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:42,917
There's something I'd like to talk to
you about when you have a moment.

433
00:25:43,017 --> 00:25:44,650
Great, do you mind
if we do it later?

434
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,451
Because my Uncle Alfie
just came in.

435
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:48,551
Sure.

436
00:25:54,472 --> 00:25:56,017
Thank you Justin.
Thank so much mate.

437
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:57,571
I hope it wasn't too
much hustle.

438
00:25:57,671 --> 00:25:58,836
How are you Uncle Alfie?

439
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:00,936
Terrible.

440
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:14,927
Ladies and Gentlemen.

441
00:26:15,027 --> 00:26:17,850
If you could all
kindly take your seats...

442
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,755
We're about to begin the service.

443
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:26,921
Simon, please.

444
00:26:27,514 --> 00:26:28,226
Move.

445
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:29,352
Don't start yet.

446
00:26:29,452 --> 00:26:31,452
Don't start. Move.

447
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:18,450
Jesus, Howard.
You stink.

448
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:22,481
Family and friends.

449
00:27:22,923 --> 00:27:26,455
Maybe, because you left me to
deal with Uncle Alfie on my own...

450
00:27:26,555 --> 00:27:28,839
...not to mention you
taking all the credit.

451
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,518
Can you please be quiet?

452
00:27:30,618 --> 00:27:33,485
We'll start with a favorite
passage of Edward's...

453
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,487
...from the King James' bible...

454
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:39,255
...it's the 1st book of Samuel
chapter 18.

455
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:42,858
Martha, just so you know,

456
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,879
we had Uncle Alfie in the
car with us.

457
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:47,779
And you took my parking space.

458
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:50,448
And I had to push him half a mile
up the hill by myself.

459
00:27:50,548 --> 00:27:52,039
Almost fainted.

460
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,738
That was MY parking space.

461
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,282
If you don't stop this...

462
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,502
...I'll take you out and kick
the living shit out of you.

463
00:27:57,602 --> 00:27:58,352
Do you understand?

464
00:27:58,452 --> 00:27:59,492
What's going on?

465
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:00,553
She stole my
parking space.

466
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:01,740
What do you mean she stole
your parking space?

467
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,645
This is a funeral.
Behave yourself.

468
00:28:06,462 --> 00:28:10,403
Then, Jonathan and David made
a covenant.

469
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:14,233
Because he loved him
as his own soul.

470
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,272
And so it came to pass
that the soul of Jonathan...

471
00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:21,025
...was knit with
the soul of David.

472
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:25,352
And Jonathan stripped himself
of the robe that was upon him...

473
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:27,492
...and gave it to David.

474
00:28:27,685 --> 00:28:30,936
And his garments,
even his sword...

475
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:33,338
...and his bow...

476
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,887
...and his belt.

477
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:44,118
Now, we'll have a few words from
Edward's son, Daniel.

478
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,535
Hi, everyone.

479
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:02,355
Thanks for so many of
you coming.

480
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:06,208
I never realised Dad was
so popular.

481
00:29:06,452 --> 00:29:08,340
In fact, it seems he has more
friends now...

482
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,925
...that he's dead, than
when he was alive.

483
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,339
My father was an exceptional man.

484
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:30,817
He was born in 1938
just a year before the war.

485
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:33,586
I'll never forget the time when
Dad took us...

486
00:29:33,686 --> 00:29:35,160
...to the place where
he grew up.

487
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,320
Near a town called Crowley
at Sassex.

488
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,754
It's changed a lot
over the years...

489
00:29:40,854 --> 00:29:43,051
...with the expansion
of Gatwick airport.

490
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:45,840
Actually, it's something of
a commuter town now...

491
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,765
...partly because of it's
proximity to London.

492
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:53,673
When my father was young it
had pastures.

493
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:57,339
And fields and greenery.

494
00:29:57,564 --> 00:30:00,180
An Dad would run around
the countryside for hours...

495
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,080
...with his close boyhood friend, Bob.

496
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,345
He told how they spend summer days
riding bikes...

497
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:09,529
Did you see that?

498
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:12,261
The coffin just moved.

499
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,386
...and swimming in the lake.

500
00:30:13,486 --> 00:30:15,486
Dad's...

501
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:23,222
Dad's first work, was working
after school...

502
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,322
...as an apprentice...

503
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,111
...for an electrician
named Mr. Thompson.

504
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:29,211
It happened again!

505
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:32,283
I'm telling you, the
coffin is moving!

506
00:30:32,383 --> 00:30:34,643
Simon, please calm down.

507
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:39,270
The coffin is moving, I tell you!

508
00:30:40,587 --> 00:30:41,911
There's someone alive in there!

509
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:44,008
Simon, where are you going?

510
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:46,555
What the hell is wrong with you all?

511
00:30:46,655 --> 00:30:48,655
Look at it!

512
00:30:48,766 --> 00:30:50,552
Can't you see?

513
00:30:50,652 --> 00:30:52,472
Open your eyes!

514
00:30:52,572 --> 00:30:55,459
It's moving around in there.

515
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,561
Can't you see?

516
00:30:56,661 --> 00:30:58,181
Simon, please.

517
00:30:58,281 --> 00:30:59,161
What are you doing there?

518
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:00,465
Stop it!

519
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:01,725
Don't touch that!

520
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:03,865
I've got to let him out!

521
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:08,167
God!

522
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:28,669
Calm down Mom.

523
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:35,292
Unbelievable, wasn't it?

524
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,255
If you like you can have some
tea and cake...

525
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:43,670
...and we'll call you as
soon as we can.

526
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,017
What the fuck was all
that about?

527
00:31:47,117 --> 00:31:48,969
Daniel, I'm so sorry.

528
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:50,205
The coffin was moving...

529
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:52,420
Just go back inside
and I'll explain it.

530
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,842
I'm so sorry.

531
00:31:53,942 --> 00:31:56,218
I'm sure I heard scratching noise...

532
00:31:56,318 --> 00:31:58,318
Please...

533
00:31:58,901 --> 00:31:59,700
Are you alright?

534
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,700
No.

535
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,965
And I haven't made the call
about the deposit yet.

536
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:07,496
Kill him.

537
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:09,596
I'm going to kill him.

538
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:10,894
Dad, leave it.

539
00:32:10,994 --> 00:32:11,693
Leave it?!

540
00:32:11,793 --> 00:32:12,926
He wrecked the funeral.

541
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:13,892
It wasn't his fault.

542
00:32:13,992 --> 00:32:15,373
What do you mean it
wasn't his fault?

543
00:32:15,473 --> 00:32:17,623
Your Aunt Sandra is in tatters.

544
00:32:17,723 --> 00:32:20,643
I want him out of hear, this moment.
Is that clear?

545
00:32:20,743 --> 00:32:23,468
Tell me you will have nothing
to do with that...

546
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:25,077
...ridiculous man, ever again.

547
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:25,923
I'm sorry.

548
00:32:26,023 --> 00:32:28,023
No, I can't do that.

549
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,838
Why not?

550
00:32:30,938 --> 00:32:33,614
Because we're moving in together.

551
00:32:33,714 --> 00:32:35,281
God.

552
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:38,150
Have you completely
lost your senses?

553
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,953
He's not actually like this.
He took some drugs and...

554
00:32:42,053 --> 00:32:42,944
...and made him act like this.

555
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,044
Drugs? What drugs?

556
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:54,123
He took some Valium and had
a bad reaction.

557
00:32:56,835 --> 00:32:58,128
Valium?

558
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,228
Yes.

559
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:04,754
That's it.

560
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,610
We'll talk about this later.

561
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,666
Simon?

562
00:33:15,766 --> 00:33:16,671
Martha...

563
00:33:16,771 --> 00:33:18,445
Okay...
Come and sit down.

564
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:20,988
Alright Janet.
I appreciate that.

565
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:23,088
Are you alright mate?

566
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,314
That was awful, wasn't it?

567
00:33:25,414 --> 00:33:27,475
He fell in front of your mom like
a dead trout...

568
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:29,011
Howard, please...

569
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:31,769
Yeah sorry. It's just...

570
00:33:31,953 --> 00:33:34,081
...you never know when it's
gonna happen to you.

571
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:36,217
Like me.
I've got this...

572
00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:38,410
...weird patch of skin

573
00:33:38,594 --> 00:33:39,807
I've had that a
couple of weeks...

574
00:33:39,907 --> 00:33:41,200
...with no idea what it is...

575
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,442
Why not show it to my Uncle Victor?
He's a doctor.

576
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:45,542
Good idea.

577
00:33:49,205 --> 00:33:50,986
I swear I saw it moving.

578
00:33:51,086 --> 00:33:54,741
I swear I saw it moving.
No one else saw it?

579
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:57,972
I swear I saw it moving.
I must be going mad.

580
00:33:58,072 --> 00:33:59,899
My hands are so big!

581
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:04,164
Simon. listen to me.
I need to tell you something.

582
00:34:05,273 --> 00:34:08,558
You know I gave you some
Valium earlier?

583
00:34:08,658 --> 00:34:09,894
Yes.

584
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:11,994
Well...

585
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:14,839
...it turns out...

586
00:34:15,177 --> 00:34:18,378
...it wasn't actually Valium
at all.

587
00:34:21,787 --> 00:34:23,320
Can you hear me?

588
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,831
Hello?

589
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:26,013
You think we can start now?

590
00:34:26,113 --> 00:34:26,724
I believe yes.

591
00:34:26,824 --> 00:34:28,824
How do you feel, Sandra?

592
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:32,181
Hello doctor.

593
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:35,007
I've had this skin discoloration for
a couple of weeks now...

594
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:37,839
It's not going anywhere.
I know it's just a small patch...

595
00:34:37,939 --> 00:34:39,910
...but it's weird.
It does look weird, doesn't it?

596
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,198
Victor, I'm going
back now.

597
00:34:42,298 --> 00:34:43,908
You should probably go see
a dermatologist.

598
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:45,707
What do you think it is?

599
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:48,089
It looks like some kind
of pigment mutation.

600
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:49,205
Pigment mutation?

601
00:34:49,305 --> 00:34:51,300
Probably some allergic
reaction to...

602
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,031
...shellfish, nuts.

603
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:54,557
What kind of nuts?

604
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:58,142
Don't know. Peanuts, almonds...
Excuse me.

605
00:35:02,498 --> 00:35:04,498
Do you see now?

606
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:07,297
Yes?

607
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:11,736
It's hallucinogenic

608
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:18,774
My advice is to relax...

609
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:20,760
...and just go with the flow.

610
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,453
Try and enjoy it.

611
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,553
You!

612
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:26,285
Simon!

613
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:27,883
How long does it last?

614
00:35:27,983 --> 00:35:28,683
I don't know.

615
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:29,582
Simon!

616
00:35:29,682 --> 00:35:31,282
Around 8 hours?

617
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:32,914
8 hours of this?

618
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:34,014
Simon let go.

619
00:35:34,114 --> 00:35:36,114
You!

620
00:35:36,392 --> 00:35:37,375
Simon?

621
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:40,110
Let me go.
I'm going to be sick.

622
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:44,298
Simon, get back.

623
00:35:44,398 --> 00:35:46,398
Simon.

624
00:35:47,626 --> 00:35:49,751
A word with you Martha...

625
00:35:50,788 --> 00:35:52,788
I'm sorry, excuse me...

626
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,321
Oh God, he's gonna be sick!

627
00:36:03,948 --> 00:36:05,948
Is it okay in there?

628
00:36:09,196 --> 00:36:11,196
Simon are you okay?

629
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:13,908
Simon.

630
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:15,991
Simon, let me in.

631
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:19,221
Simon.

632
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:20,768
Martha?

633
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:22,992
Did you happen to see
a pill bottle?

634
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:23,811
Shit

635
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:24,891
Simon?

636
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:26,150
Right!

637
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,651
Keep it together!

638
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:28,822
Keep it together...

639
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:30,902
You can do this.

640
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:32,981
You're Simon Smith.

641
00:36:33,788 --> 00:36:35,788
You're a solicitor.

642
00:36:38,348 --> 00:36:39,900
8 hours...

643
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,458
No problem.

644
00:36:41,558 --> 00:36:43,558
8 hours is at...

645
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:45,871
Where's my watch?

646
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,305
It's already been...

647
00:36:50,366 --> 00:36:52,366
Simon, open the door.

648
00:36:52,703 --> 00:36:56,426
7 hours to go.
God, Jesus!

649
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:58,137
Fuck!

650
00:36:58,237 --> 00:36:59,387
<i>Fuck.</i>

651
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:01,395
It's nothing to worry about.

652
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:03,446
<i>Jesus!
Fuck!</i>

653
00:37:03,546 --> 00:37:05,728
Grief does strange things to
people doesn't it?

654
00:37:05,828 --> 00:37:07,672
Yeah.

655
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:09,660
If you remember, I have something
to talk to you about.

656
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,371
Oh yes, yes.

657
00:37:11,471 --> 00:37:13,002
Is there some place quiet
we can go?

658
00:37:13,102 --> 00:37:15,102
Sure.

659
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,432
Are you writing a book?

660
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:42,438
Yes.

661
00:37:42,538 --> 00:37:42,807
Like your brother.

662
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:44,207
Well yes, but I write different.

663
00:37:44,307 --> 00:37:45,439
He's a great writer
isn't he?

664
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:46,836
Yes, he is.

665
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:48,213
Anyway...

666
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:50,290
Yes, actually...

667
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,518
...I have some photos
I wanted to show you.

668
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:54,032
Okay.

669
00:37:54,132 --> 00:37:56,132
- May I?
- Sure

670
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,600
We became quite close
your father and I...

671
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,931
...the last few months.

672
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:04,169
Ended up spending quite a
lot of time together.

673
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:05,319
Right.

674
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:08,272
Here's me and your father
at Ridgens Park.

675
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:09,293
Ah, yes

676
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:12,691
And here we are on top of
those London buses

677
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,791
Terrible picture of me.

678
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:17,314
Where did you and my dad meet?

679
00:38:17,414 --> 00:38:19,414
Just around.

680
00:38:23,685 --> 00:38:25,685
Simon.

681
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,583
Are you alright?

682
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:31,809
Yes, yes...

683
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:34,536
Keep on coming, you...

684
00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:36,636
...and join the others.

685
00:38:36,828 --> 00:38:38,828
Join the others and...

686
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:46,401
Here we are at a fancy
costume party...

687
00:38:46,653 --> 00:38:47,538
...in Kensington.

688
00:38:47,638 --> 00:38:51,548
That's your dad dressed up
as a Roman Centurion.

689
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:01,131
In what capacity were you
actually friends with my dad?

690
00:39:01,231 --> 00:39:02,847
I mean no offense...

691
00:39:02,947 --> 00:39:05,215
...but he never mentioned
you to me...

692
00:39:05,315 --> 00:39:07,571
...and you have all these
pictures with him...

693
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:09,671
...as if you were...

694
00:39:27,378 --> 00:39:29,378
"Screen Goddesses"

695
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,309
Oh God.

696
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,409
Oh my God!

697
00:39:43,352 --> 00:39:46,511
I know this might come as
quite a shock to you

698
00:39:46,611 --> 00:39:48,189
I'm sure he would have told you
himself...

699
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:50,974
...but he wasn't sure how
you'd react.

700
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:51,943
My mother knows of this?

701
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:53,201
No.

702
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:56,628
And there's no reason
she should find out.

703
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,618
As long as I get what's
owed to me.

704
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:01,196
What?

705
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:04,113
Well, I think I deserve
something.

706
00:40:04,934 --> 00:40:07,399
Your father and I
were lovers.

707
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:12,448
He left me absolutely nothing in
his will.

708
00:40:12,548 --> 00:40:14,447
How do you think that makes
me feel?

709
00:40:14,547 --> 00:40:16,273
I'll tell you how it makes
me feel.

710
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:17,806
Cheap.

711
00:40:17,906 --> 00:40:19,906
Like a cheap slut.

712
00:40:20,153 --> 00:40:22,651
Don't you think
I deserve something?

713
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:24,751
What do you want?

714
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:29,242
Well I think 15,000 pounds
should do it.

715
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:31,695
15,000 pounds?

716
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,070
I'm supposed to be
buying a flat.

717
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,825
Well that's up to you.

718
00:40:34,925 --> 00:40:36,691
Wait a minute...

719
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:38,571
You think you can come in here
and show me...

720
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:39,898
...pictures of you and my dad...

721
00:40:39,998 --> 00:40:41,651
...on a bus, and that counts as proof?

722
00:40:41,751 --> 00:40:43,791
That's no fucking proof.

723
00:40:45,422 --> 00:40:47,403
What's that?

724
00:40:47,503 --> 00:40:49,192
Jesus

725
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:51,292
Now, I don't want to.

726
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:55,300
But I'll go out there and I'll show
these photos to every single person.

727
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,120
Do you really want me
to do that?

728
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:02,638
You wait here.

729
00:41:02,738 --> 00:41:04,738
Wait here.

730
00:41:06,993 --> 00:41:07,914
Daniel.

731
00:41:08,014 --> 00:41:10,419
I was telling George here
how when we were boys,...

732
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:14,939
...your dad loved to makes us go
naked to take a bath.

733
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,529
Simon, open the door.

734
00:41:34,844 --> 00:41:36,643
Anything I can do
to help?

735
00:41:36,743 --> 00:41:37,941
Not really. Thanks.

736
00:41:38,041 --> 00:41:40,041
Everything under control?

737
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:42,141
Simon?

738
00:41:42,241 --> 00:41:43,849
So what are you doing next weekend?

739
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:45,407
I've got a couple of tickets
and backstage passes...

740
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:47,060
Look Justin. I've got
a lot on my plate right now...

741
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,254
...and I can't deal with
your shit.

742
00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:50,734
Can you please just go away?

743
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,966
Please.

744
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:56,866
Simon?

745
00:42:01,194 --> 00:42:02,200
Can I talk to you?

746
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:02,895
Not now.

747
00:42:02,995 --> 00:42:04,835
It's important.

748
00:42:04,935 --> 00:42:05,729
It's okay.

749
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:07,829
Excuse us.

750
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,059
What are you doing?

751
00:42:15,155 --> 00:42:17,954
Remember the little guy
from before that we didn't know...

752
00:42:18,054 --> 00:42:19,100
...the short guy.

753
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,578
Yeah.

754
00:42:20,678 --> 00:42:22,051
I was just being with him
in the study.

755
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:24,151
And?

756
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:26,548
He showed me these pictures.

757
00:42:26,648 --> 00:42:27,470
Yeah.

758
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,695
- Of him and Dad.
- Right.

759
00:42:29,946 --> 00:42:31,628
Of him and Dad together.

760
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:33,728
Right.

761
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:35,743
Him and Dad together at parties
in Kensington...

762
00:42:35,843 --> 00:42:37,087
Is this going anywhere?
'Cause...

763
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,187
He was shacking Dad.

764
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:41,541
Fuck off.

765
00:42:45,399 --> 00:42:46,500
You shitting me?

766
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,500
I'm not shitting you.
I'm telling you.

767
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,665
He showed me the pictures.
I feel sick.

768
00:42:50,765 --> 00:42:52,432
What are you saying?

769
00:42:52,532 --> 00:42:54,074
Dad was a gay?

770
00:42:54,174 --> 00:42:56,174
That's what I'm saying.

771
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:58,004
And he was cheating on Mom?

772
00:42:58,104 --> 00:42:59,550
Evidently.

773
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,310
With that little...

774
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,231
Yes.

775
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,626
I know it's a bombshell...

776
00:43:04,726 --> 00:43:06,487
...but the concern right now
is that he wants money.

777
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:07,359
What do you mean?

778
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,018
He wants money.
He wants 15,000 pounds.

779
00:43:09,118 --> 00:43:10,241
Tell him to go fuck himself.

780
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:11,782
Don't you understand?
He's got the pictures.

781
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:13,656
If we don't give him the money
he's gonna tell everybody here...

782
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:15,354
...the most intimate details
of their sex life.

783
00:43:15,454 --> 00:43:16,735
Well I don't want to hear
those intimate details.

784
00:43:16,835 --> 00:43:17,586
Exactly.

785
00:43:17,686 --> 00:43:19,686
What 're we gonna do?

786
00:43:20,752 --> 00:43:22,150
Shit.

787
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,250
Think then.

788
00:43:25,095 --> 00:43:27,095
Well okay, alright...

789
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:32,953
What a fucking waste of time.

790
00:43:33,053 --> 00:43:34,209
I don't know why I even
bothered.

791
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:36,114
I dressed up and everything...

792
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,650
And she's more interested
in that idiot...

793
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,750
...than she's in me.

794
00:43:39,973 --> 00:43:41,889
I tell you, this world is
severely fucked.

795
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,199
Sounds serious.
Doesn't it?

796
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:45,509
- What?
- Pigment mutation.

797
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:50,274
Can you taste this?
I think it has almonds in it.

798
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:51,067
Yeah?

799
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,249
So, Daniel's uncle said I'm
allergic to almonds.

800
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:54,361
Don't eat it then.

801
00:43:54,461 --> 00:43:55,628
Be a friend. Taste it.
Tell me what you think.

802
00:43:55,728 --> 00:43:56,368
No.

803
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:57,564
Come on taste it.

804
00:43:57,664 --> 00:43:58,497
I won't.

805
00:43:58,597 --> 00:44:01,162
Come on, please. Can't you
just do me a favor?

806
00:44:01,262 --> 00:44:03,387
Will you please fuck off.

807
00:44:05,136 --> 00:44:06,619
Have you seen a pill bottle
lying around?

808
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,506
It looked like a Valium bottle.

809
00:44:08,606 --> 00:44:09,252
No.

810
00:44:09,352 --> 00:44:11,352
Shit.

811
00:44:22,984 --> 00:44:24,984
It won't be long now.

812
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:33,977
Shall we go inside?

813
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:36,077
In a minute.

814
00:44:42,733 --> 00:44:44,733
Doctor, could you...

815
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:56,764
Hello

816
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,479
I'm sorry about...

817
00:45:00,063 --> 00:45:02,063
Thank you.

818
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,721
It must me terrible losing
a husband.

819
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:08,892
You're still so young.

820
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:12,301
Are you gonna get married again?

821
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:15,454
It's not an easy thing to
say, is it?

822
00:45:15,554 --> 00:45:18,287
It's just terrible isn't it?
People die...

823
00:45:18,387 --> 00:45:19,100
How awful is that?

824
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,948
There was a guy that I know...

825
00:45:21,048 --> 00:45:23,592
...someone stabbed him to death
because he called his mother "moose".

826
00:45:23,692 --> 00:45:25,452
And the guy just...

827
00:45:25,552 --> 00:45:27,481
...stabbed him right in the neck.

828
00:45:27,581 --> 00:45:29,597
He cut a major artery.

829
00:45:30,036 --> 00:45:33,485
And you want believe how
much blood...

830
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,985
was bursting absolutely
everywhere...

831
00:45:36,085 --> 00:45:38,183
And the ridiculous thing is that
the guy who did it...

832
00:45:38,283 --> 00:45:43,553
...told the police later, he didn't
even know what "moose" was.

833
00:45:44,162 --> 00:45:46,457
The cake has almonds in it?

834
00:45:47,568 --> 00:45:49,948
It's alright.
Doesn't matter.

835
00:45:52,157 --> 00:45:54,157
Excuse me.

836
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:58,109
Nice talking to you.

837
00:46:08,123 --> 00:46:09,150
<i>Let me rephrase the question.</i>

838
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,654
What do you mean it's best that
I pay the money?

839
00:46:11,754 --> 00:46:13,635
Well you've been living off
Mom and Dad. You must have...

840
00:46:13,735 --> 00:46:14,268
...some money left.

841
00:46:14,368 --> 00:46:15,640
I haven't been...

842
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,577
I paid for this
entire funeral Robert.

843
00:46:17,677 --> 00:46:19,477
Wait a second.

844
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:23,572
How do you know this guy isn't
bullshitting you?

845
00:46:26,778 --> 00:46:28,778
God!

846
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:31,345
Simon?

847
00:46:32,867 --> 00:46:34,867
<i>Simon?</i>

848
00:46:34,994 --> 00:46:36,994
Simon?

849
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,327
Simon?

850
00:46:39,427 --> 00:46:41,427
<i>Simon?</i>

851
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:44,280
Simon?

852
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,380
<i>Simon!</i>

853
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:49,253
Si?

854
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:51,353
<i>...mon!</i>

855
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,627
I think we're just about ready to
resume the ceremony...

856
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:03,211
Would you mind giving us five minutes?

857
00:47:03,311 --> 00:47:05,311
- Of course.
- Thanks.

858
00:47:10,196 --> 00:47:11,156
What's going on?

859
00:47:11,256 --> 00:47:13,237
I'm really sorry but I think
our moving out plans...

860
00:47:13,337 --> 00:47:15,762
...will have to be put on hold.
Just for a little while.

861
00:47:15,862 --> 00:47:16,500
What do you mean?
Why?

862
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,754
I don't have time to explain
right now.

863
00:47:17,854 --> 00:47:19,800
I wouldn't do this unless
I really had to.

864
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,856
What's the reason?

865
00:47:20,956 --> 00:47:23,676
I can't explain right now, okay?

866
00:47:32,013 --> 00:47:34,818
So you're the blackmailing prick.

867
00:47:36,455 --> 00:47:37,297
What're you doing with that?

868
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,654
It's my manuscript.
It's not to be read by anyone.

869
00:47:39,754 --> 00:47:41,247
You shouldn't leave it
lying around, Daniel...

870
00:47:41,347 --> 00:47:42,630
...if you don't want people to
read it.

871
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,426
This is my office.

872
00:47:43,526 --> 00:47:45,809
Guys! Can we just
get to the point?

873
00:47:45,909 --> 00:47:47,909
Fine by me.

874
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:53,180
I'll write you this check and that's
the end of it. Yes?

875
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,119
You give us the photos and you stay
out of our lives for ever.

876
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:57,344
- Yeah?
- That's the deal.

877
00:48:13,546 --> 00:48:15,355
Is that your first attempt?

878
00:48:15,455 --> 00:48:16,239
What?

879
00:48:16,339 --> 00:48:17,798
That's your first novel
isn't it?

880
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:19,789
Yeah.

881
00:48:19,889 --> 00:48:20,573
So?

882
00:48:20,673 --> 00:48:22,673
So, nothing.

883
00:48:22,957 --> 00:48:26,697
I tried to write once.
It didn't work for me.

884
00:48:27,047 --> 00:48:31,277
I think it's like a gift.
You either have it or you don't.

885
00:48:31,377 --> 00:48:33,033
It must be hard for you
though, Daniel...

886
00:48:33,133 --> 00:48:35,897
...living up to your brother's
reputation.

887
00:48:35,997 --> 00:48:39,578
Always living in the shadow
of a sibling like that.

888
00:48:39,678 --> 00:48:41,091
By the way...

889
00:48:41,191 --> 00:48:43,571
...I read your latest novel.

890
00:48:44,218 --> 00:48:46,218
Really good stuff.

891
00:48:46,662 --> 00:48:48,662
Thanks.

892
00:48:49,891 --> 00:48:51,891
Alright. That's it.

893
00:48:52,458 --> 00:48:53,941
Daniel, what the hell
are you doing?

894
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:57,280
There's no way I'm giving this ass
a penny of my money.

895
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,579
Don't be ridiculous.

896
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:00,679
Why should I?

897
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,566
He comes in here in the day
of our father's fuberal...

898
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:04,649
...he tries to blackmail us
and bad mouths my novel.

899
00:49:04,749 --> 00:49:05,663
Who does he think he is?

900
00:49:05,763 --> 00:49:06,643
He has the photos.

901
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,022
Let him show the photos.
I don't care.

902
00:49:08,122 --> 00:49:08,765
Daniel.

903
00:49:08,865 --> 00:49:10,709
No Robert.
I give up, okay?

904
00:49:10,809 --> 00:49:12,239
I give up.
I can't take anymore.

905
00:49:12,339 --> 00:49:16,759
If that's what he's going to do,
fine, let him do it.

906
00:49:17,768 --> 00:49:19,451
No problem.

907
00:49:19,551 --> 00:49:21,299
What?

908
00:49:21,399 --> 00:49:23,390
Wait, wait...

909
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,645
Please, get out of my way.

910
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:27,179
Let's discuss this
a minute.

911
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:29,344
There's nothing to discuss.

912
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:31,444
Get out of my way.

913
00:49:36,567 --> 00:49:38,607
Get up and help, Daniel!

914
00:49:40,123 --> 00:49:41,922
What are you doing Robert?

915
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:43,474
Get a rope or something!

916
00:49:43,574 --> 00:49:45,170
We don't have any rope.

917
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:46,733
Get something...

918
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,873
There, from the curtain.

919
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:50,400
Take it.

920
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,500
Tie his legs.

921
00:49:54,685 --> 00:49:58,000
Jesus Robert.
This is a really bad idea.

922
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:38,833
Fucking men.

923
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:40,933
Tell me about it.

924
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:42,743
Daniel, get that tie.

925
00:50:42,843 --> 00:50:43,270
Why?

926
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,218
Just get it.

927
00:50:45,318 --> 00:50:46,593
What are we gonna
do with it?

928
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:48,783
- Do whatever
- But I don't know.

929
00:50:48,883 --> 00:50:50,200
Stuff it in his mouth.

930
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,065
This is ridiculous.

931
00:50:51,165 --> 00:50:52,364
Daniel?

932
00:50:52,464 --> 00:50:54,464
Jesus.
Shut the door!

933
00:50:54,764 --> 00:50:57,450
Why? What's going on?
Who's that?

934
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:58,899
It's a seizure.

935
00:50:58,999 --> 00:51:00,572
God...really?

936
00:51:00,672 --> 00:51:02,793
I just found some Valium.

937
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,669
Bring them here.

938
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,537
How many?

939
00:51:04,637 --> 00:51:05,472
I don't know.

940
00:51:05,572 --> 00:51:06,353
A handful.

941
00:51:06,453 --> 00:51:08,453
Really? Okay.

942
00:51:10,148 --> 00:51:12,148
Wait, you dropped one.

943
00:51:12,853 --> 00:51:13,796
Open his mouth.

944
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:15,120
Okay.

945
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,210
It will be alright.

946
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,744
Have you seen a little bottle?

947
00:51:18,844 --> 00:51:19,969
Jesus, Howard...

948
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:21,657
...I told you to lock the
fucking door.

949
00:51:21,757 --> 00:51:22,956
You said to shut the
fucking door.

950
00:51:23,056 --> 00:51:23,717
What's going on?

951
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:24,411
Oh, he's having a seizure.

952
00:51:24,511 --> 00:51:25,714
Seizure?

953
00:51:25,814 --> 00:51:27,814
Why is he all tied up?

954
00:51:36,918 --> 00:51:38,918
Hello.

955
00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:41,327
He's blackmailing you?
Over what?

956
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:42,267
It doesn't matter now.

957
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:43,246
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

958
00:51:43,346 --> 00:51:44,331
It's personal.

959
00:51:44,431 --> 00:51:45,017
Why?

960
00:51:45,117 --> 00:51:46,319
He said it's personal.

961
00:51:46,419 --> 00:51:47,000
But why?

962
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,913
Just trust us.

963
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:49,684
This is not a good guy.

964
00:51:49,784 --> 00:51:51,160
So, what are we gonna
do with him?

965
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,518
- What're we gonna do?
- I don't know.

966
00:51:53,618 --> 00:51:55,126
What do you mean
you don't know?

967
00:51:55,226 --> 00:51:56,734
Shut up Daniel.
I've had enough.

968
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:59,205
How long is the Valium
gonna last?

969
00:51:59,305 --> 00:51:59,805
What is it?

970
00:51:59,905 --> 00:52:00,895
- Valium?
- Yeah.

971
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:02,666
Yeah, I found those Valium.

972
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:06,591
We gave him a few to calm him
down. Thank you.

973
00:52:07,643 --> 00:52:09,215
Shit.

974
00:52:09,315 --> 00:52:11,315
What is it?

975
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:12,988
What's wrong?

976
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,088
Fuck!

977
00:52:16,577 --> 00:52:18,577
What?

978
00:52:21,466 --> 00:52:23,466
Thing is...

979
00:52:23,714 --> 00:52:25,628
...it's not really Valium.

980
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:27,095
It's mostly acid.

981
00:52:27,195 --> 00:52:27,957
What?!

982
00:52:28,057 --> 00:52:30,264
Simon took one by mistake, that's
why he's acting like this.

983
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:31,662
And what are you doing with this?

984
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:32,643
They're for a friend.

985
00:52:32,743 --> 00:52:33,526
Wait a minute.

986
00:52:33,626 --> 00:52:34,606
You're telling us that..

987
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:38,505
Martha's boyfriend who knocked over
Dad's coffin had just one of these things.

988
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:39,507
And you gave him how many?

989
00:52:39,607 --> 00:52:41,503
Five.

990
00:52:41,603 --> 00:52:43,575
You can't blame me for this.

991
00:52:43,675 --> 00:52:44,535
Poor bastard.

992
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:45,732
We should call an ambulance.

993
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:47,115
Can't do that.
You'll be screwed.

994
00:52:47,215 --> 00:52:51,150
They're gonna find out he's been
force-fed hard drugs.

995
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,428
What's gonna happen?
Is he gonna die?

996
00:52:53,528 --> 00:52:55,289
No.

997
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:57,595
That is, I don't think so.

998
00:52:57,695 --> 00:52:59,691
<i>Daniel?</i>

999
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,861
Robert?

1000
00:53:03,961 --> 00:53:06,376
<i>We'll be out in a
minute, Mom.</i>

1001
00:53:06,871 --> 00:53:08,059
We need to go outside.

1002
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,219
You two stay here
and look after him.

1003
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:13,748
Look after him?

1004
00:53:13,848 --> 00:53:15,484
What do you mean?
What're we supposed to do?

1005
00:53:15,584 --> 00:53:17,215
Make sure he doesn't escape.

1006
00:53:17,315 --> 00:53:19,355
Lock the door behind us.

1007
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:21,847
Hi Mom.
How's it going?

1008
00:53:21,947 --> 00:53:23,200
Reverend Davis needs to
speak to you.

1009
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,396
Can we resume the service now?

1010
00:53:25,496 --> 00:53:27,207
I need to leave by 3.

1011
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:28,953
Yes, that's great. But we
need to have a chat.

1012
00:53:29,053 --> 00:53:30,476
So can we take five more minutes?

1013
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:33,381
- Of course.
- Is there a problem?

1014
00:53:33,641 --> 00:53:35,641
Jesus.

1015
00:53:38,252 --> 00:53:42,077
Why didn't you just pay him
the fucking money?

1016
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,120
Where's my tea?

1017
00:53:50,865 --> 00:53:52,865
What's your problem?

1018
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,830
Women.

1019
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,369
Women, women...

1020
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:01,715
Let me tell you something
about women.

1021
00:54:01,815 --> 00:54:03,171
When I was a young man...

1022
00:54:03,271 --> 00:54:07,243
...I use to go out with the most
beautiful woman in the village.

1023
00:54:07,343 --> 00:54:10,005
She'd walk into the room
and everyone's eyes would turn.

1024
00:54:10,105 --> 00:54:12,018
Everyone wanted to fuck her.

1025
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:15,433
And of course she
liked the attention...

1026
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,575
I have to take a shit.

1027
00:54:24,746 --> 00:54:26,400
I can't believe you gave
him five pills.

1028
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,850
Who can we blame for this?

1029
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:30,109
Even if it was Valium, you should never
give him five. Don't you know anything?

1030
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:32,441
No, I don't know about
giving pills.

1031
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:34,541
<i>Hello?</i>

1032
00:54:37,934 --> 00:54:39,404
Yes?

1033
00:54:39,504 --> 00:54:41,504
<i>I need the toilet.</i>

1034
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:43,973
Could you use the
one upstairs?

1035
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,767
<i>I'm on a wheelchair you
fucking idiot.</i>

1036
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:47,766
<i>How am I supposed
to get upstairs?</i>

1037
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:49,866
<i>Open the door.</i>

1038
00:54:50,742 --> 00:54:52,264
Wait a minute.

1039
00:54:52,364 --> 00:54:53,231
God.

1040
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,229
What do we do?

1041
00:54:54,329 --> 00:54:56,454
Put him behind the couch.

1042
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:00,455
We're looking for the key.

1043
00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:02,512
Hurry.

1044
00:55:02,612 --> 00:55:04,568
Shut up!

1045
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:07,214
<i>Hurry up!</i>

1046
00:55:07,314 --> 00:55:09,314
Coming.

1047
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:13,803
Hello.

1048
00:55:13,903 --> 00:55:17,133
What the hell is wrong
with you people?

1049
00:55:17,805 --> 00:55:19,548
I'm about to shit
in my trousers.

1050
00:55:19,648 --> 00:55:21,648
Come on.

1051
00:55:25,056 --> 00:55:26,169
Justin, what is it now?

1052
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:27,768
Just want to talk to you.

1053
00:55:27,868 --> 00:55:29,684
Please don't make me go
through this again.

1054
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:32,343
What are you so afraid
of, Martha?

1055
00:55:32,443 --> 00:55:33,200
I know you feel the same way.

1056
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,720
You can't fight what
we had together.

1057
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,624
Justin, it was one night,
it was a massive mistake.

1058
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:40,237
I was drunk and out of my mind.
It could have been a donkey.

1059
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,148
What's he got that
I don't have?

1060
00:55:42,248 --> 00:55:43,071
Okay.

1061
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:44,998
For one thing, he's responsible...

1062
00:55:45,098 --> 00:55:47,017
...he's thoughtful,
he's intelligent...

1063
00:55:47,117 --> 00:55:50,517
...he's stable...
Is that enough for you?

1064
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:04,277
Stop acting as if this is
all my fault.

1065
00:56:04,377 --> 00:56:05,987
I'm not the one who attacked the guy
and tied him up.

1066
00:56:06,087 --> 00:56:07,272
Someone had to look out
for Mom.

1067
00:56:07,372 --> 00:56:09,330
I've been looking out for Mom
since you dissapeared...

1068
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:10,183
...and went to New York...

1069
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,768
...to fool around with your
celebrity friends.

1070
00:56:12,868 --> 00:56:14,457
You're really unbelievable.

1071
00:56:14,557 --> 00:56:15,872
You can't get over it,
can you?

1072
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:16,874
Get over what?

1073
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,545
You're burning with jealousy...

1074
00:56:18,645 --> 00:56:21,679
...because you spend three years
working on a novel...

1075
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:22,946
...and you won't even let
anyone see it.

1076
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,312
And why should I?

1077
00:56:24,412 --> 00:56:27,141
What will you do?
Wait until you're dead?

1078
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:29,242
And hope that it
gets published?

1079
00:56:29,342 --> 00:56:30,698
You just write
common crap.

1080
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:31,980
It's not crap.

1081
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,830
You're a hypocrite.

1082
00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,480
And you're the most selfish...

1083
00:56:36,505 --> 00:56:38,545
Daniel, what's going on?

1084
00:56:38,737 --> 00:56:39,846
This is your father's funeral.

1085
00:56:39,946 --> 00:56:40,865
Not now, Jane.

1086
00:56:40,965 --> 00:56:42,230
Why are you acting like this?

1087
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,330
Jane, not now...

1088
00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:48,294
It's about the flat
isn't it?

1089
00:56:48,394 --> 00:56:48,886
What?

1090
00:56:48,986 --> 00:56:50,946
Because you don't want to go
do you?

1091
00:56:51,046 --> 00:56:51,533
Jane...

1092
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:53,371
Tell her Daniel.

1093
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:55,471
Tell me what?

1094
00:56:59,529 --> 00:57:01,968
Jane, do you remember
that short...

1095
00:57:02,068 --> 00:57:03,623
...man, that I pointed at
earlier?

1096
00:57:03,723 --> 00:57:04,416
- You remember?
- Yes.

1097
00:57:04,516 --> 00:57:06,747
It turns out, he had an affair
with Dad.

1098
00:57:06,847 --> 00:57:08,855
And now he's blackmailing us
into giving him 15,000 pounds...

1099
00:57:08,955 --> 00:57:11,894
...or else he's going to show the
pictures where they're doing...stuff.

1100
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:13,994
- Sex stuff.
- Yeah.

1101
00:57:15,845 --> 00:57:17,585
Is this some short
of a sick joke?

1102
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:20,320
Of course it's not a sick joke.

1103
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:24,942
Your father was gay?

1104
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,587
- Hurry up.
- I am...

1105
00:57:26,687 --> 00:57:28,233
Hurry up.

1106
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:30,458
I'm going to go!
Hurry up!

1107
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:32,728
- Quick.
- Give me that.

1108
00:57:32,998 --> 00:57:33,794
Lift me.
Help me.

1109
00:57:33,894 --> 00:57:34,932
I am.

1110
00:57:35,032 --> 00:57:36,042
Put your arms around me.

1111
00:57:36,142 --> 00:57:37,339
Lift me.

1112
00:57:37,439 --> 00:57:39,439
Christ!

1113
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:40,810
You weigh a ton.

1114
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:41,978
- You got me?
- Yes I've got you.

1115
00:57:42,078 --> 00:57:42,944
Sure I got you.

1116
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:43,619
Quickly!

1117
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:45,428
Alright. I'm trying to see
where the toilet is.

1118
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:46,372
Get my trousers down.

1119
00:57:46,472 --> 00:57:47,172
Shit...

1120
00:57:47,272 --> 00:57:48,882
No, you do it.
I'll hold you.

1121
00:57:48,982 --> 00:57:50,735
How can I do it?
I'm handicapped.

1122
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:52,453
Get it down!

1123
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:54,542
Fuck

1124
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:56,440
- Hurry up
- I am

1125
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,630
Alright, do it.

1126
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,227
Underpants, underpants...

1127
00:57:59,327 --> 00:58:00,650
Move it, come on.

1128
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,750
Quick, quick...

1129
00:58:02,853 --> 00:58:04,496
I have to go...
I have to go...

1130
00:58:04,596 --> 00:58:06,153
it's down.
Everything is down!

1131
00:58:06,253 --> 00:58:07,261
- Over there?
- I don't know.

1132
00:58:07,361 --> 00:58:08,255
Over there?

1133
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:08,850
Yes.

1134
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,237
- Are you sure?
- Yes sit down!

1135
00:58:10,337 --> 00:58:12,337
- Sure?
- Sit down!

1136
00:58:13,424 --> 00:58:14,930
Sit down!

1137
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:15,949
Wait!
Wait a moment!

1138
00:58:16,049 --> 00:58:18,049
Oh, that's better.

1139
00:58:24,972 --> 00:58:26,972
God.

1140
00:58:27,997 --> 00:58:29,035
God!

1141
00:58:29,135 --> 00:58:30,428
What's with all the noise?

1142
00:58:30,528 --> 00:58:32,528
Oh God!

1143
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,750
Howard?

1144
00:58:46,612 --> 00:58:48,612
Howard?

1145
00:58:49,677 --> 00:58:51,117
Please. Clean up!

1146
00:58:51,217 --> 00:58:52,950
Howard?

1147
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:55,050
What?

1148
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,530
You missed a bit.

1149
00:59:08,956 --> 00:59:12,421
The shit in your mouth will be the least
to worry about if we get caught.

1150
00:59:12,521 --> 00:59:14,731
<i>I've got shit in my mouth?</i>

1151
00:59:32,645 --> 00:59:34,645
Check him. Touch him.

1152
00:59:36,878 --> 00:59:38,878
Are you alright mate?

1153
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,202
try again.

1154
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,191
Mate?

1155
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:45,983
<i>Mate?</i>

1156
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,083
Wake him up.

1157
00:59:48,271 --> 00:59:49,366
Mate.

1158
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:50,253
What's his name?

1159
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,353
I don't know.

1160
00:59:52,776 --> 00:59:54,776
try Philip.

1161
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:04,424
<i>Philip?</i>

1162
01:00:09,877 --> 01:00:11,877
Philip?
Wake up mate.

1163
01:00:12,149 --> 01:00:13,194
Are you okay?

1164
01:00:13,294 --> 01:00:13,961
Shit.

1165
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:16,061
Philip?

1166
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:20,475
He might not be a Philip.

1167
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,575
Maybe something else.

1168
01:00:22,978 --> 01:00:24,178
Pinch him.

1169
01:00:24,278 --> 01:00:26,278
Please.
Pinch him.

1170
01:00:29,808 --> 01:00:31,808
Mate?

1171
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,270
<i>I think he's breathing.</i>

1172
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:39,469
What?

1173
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:41,569
He must be breathing.

1174
01:00:53,794 --> 01:00:55,794
Shit.

1175
01:00:55,894 --> 01:00:57,893
- Is he okay?
- No.

1176
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:02,739
He's dead.

1177
01:01:06,928 --> 01:01:09,145
If that's the way it is,
we have to give him the money.

1178
01:01:09,245 --> 01:01:11,408
It's not that simple.

1179
01:01:11,508 --> 01:01:12,158
Why not?

1180
01:01:12,258 --> 01:01:14,036
Daniel refused to pay, so...

1181
01:01:14,136 --> 01:01:15,782
...we're completely fucked.

1182
01:01:15,882 --> 01:01:17,882
Just shut up.

1183
01:01:30,673 --> 01:01:32,673
Sorry.

1184
01:01:36,504 --> 01:01:39,054
Hi, sorry, may I come through?

1185
01:01:42,234 --> 01:01:44,869
Just getting through.
Thank you.

1186
01:01:53,124 --> 01:01:56,184
Why are you smiling like that
Howard?

1187
01:01:57,555 --> 01:01:59,042
I wonder if I could
ask you too...

1188
01:01:59,142 --> 01:02:02,107
...come to the study for a second?

1189
01:02:06,212 --> 01:02:08,047
We'll be back soon.

1190
01:02:08,147 --> 01:02:10,147
Alright.

1191
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:14,542
<i>It's Howard.</i>

1192
01:02:21,197 --> 01:02:23,197
Jesus.
What is this?

1193
01:02:24,588 --> 01:02:26,000
It's...
Call Uncle Victor.

1194
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:26,835
No point.

1195
01:02:26,935 --> 01:02:27,664
What do you mean?

1196
01:02:27,764 --> 01:02:30,144
Look at him.
He's stone dead.

1197
01:02:34,085 --> 01:02:36,582
What the hell did
you do to him?!

1198
01:02:36,682 --> 01:02:37,485
We didn't do anything.

1199
01:02:37,585 --> 01:02:39,157
He hit his head on the corner.

1200
01:02:39,257 --> 01:02:40,871
Hit his head on the corner?

1201
01:02:40,971 --> 01:02:44,379
He hit his head. That's what happened.
Why? What do you think?

1202
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,542
This is really bad.

1203
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:46,970
This is really, really bad.

1204
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,004
What're we gonna do?

1205
01:02:48,104 --> 01:02:49,325
Actually, I really got to go.

1206
01:02:49,425 --> 01:02:50,484
You're not going anywhere.

1207
01:02:50,584 --> 01:02:52,411
I can't go to prison.

1208
01:02:52,511 --> 01:02:55,489
You have any idea what they do to
blokes like me in prison?

1209
01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:57,287
<i>I can't go to prison</i>

1210
01:02:57,387 --> 01:02:59,387
Howard. Just calm down.

1211
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:05,751
Now...

1212
01:03:07,334 --> 01:03:09,702
Nobody here knows, who this
guy is right?

1213
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:11,409
They don't even
know his name.

1214
01:03:11,509 --> 01:03:13,492
Probably didn't even
notice him.

1215
01:03:13,592 --> 01:03:16,114
Didn't notice him?
He's four fucking feet tall.

1216
01:03:16,214 --> 01:03:20,208
Alright. We'll just get rid of the body
as if he came and left.

1217
01:03:20,308 --> 01:03:21,950
Get rid of the body?

1218
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:23,470
What are you talking about?

1219
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,030
What do we know about
getting rid of bodies?

1220
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:30,825
What are you gonna do. Will you
throw him out in the rubbish?

1221
01:03:30,925 --> 01:03:32,260
Any of you happened to notice...

1222
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,420
...the size of Uncle Eddie's coffin?

1223
01:03:36,471 --> 01:03:39,977
Are you suggesting that we bury
him with my father?

1224
01:03:40,077 --> 01:03:41,527
Why not?

1225
01:03:41,627 --> 01:03:44,140
it's not like he's gonna
know, is he?

1226
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,322
That's not the point.

1227
01:03:48,578 --> 01:03:50,578
it makes sense Daniel.

1228
01:03:51,071 --> 01:03:52,894
The coffin is there, the hole in the
ground is there...

1229
01:03:52,994 --> 01:03:55,089
...they go, and that's all.
End of story.

1230
01:03:55,189 --> 01:03:58,079
Unless you got
a better suggestion.

1231
01:04:08,513 --> 01:04:09,602
I mean, come on look...

1232
01:04:09,702 --> 01:04:11,470
...you got to do whatever it
is in life

1233
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,071
...that get you up the most.

1234
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:14,017
Yeah.

1235
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:16,869
But maybe I don't consider my life
anymore as being me,me,me...

1236
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:20,451
...maybe I've discovered something out
of myself that I care about.

1237
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:22,849
And maybe you should do it
too, Justin.

1238
01:04:22,949 --> 01:04:26,159
That's a bit harsh, 'cause
I really care about you.

1239
01:04:26,259 --> 01:04:28,284
No Justin. You care
about you.

1240
01:04:28,384 --> 01:04:30,133
You care about me in relation
to how I affect you.

1241
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,233
There's a difference.

1242
01:04:32,347 --> 01:04:34,347
No. That's not true.

1243
01:04:34,886 --> 01:04:36,886
Martha.

1244
01:04:39,962 --> 01:04:40,973
I love you Martha.

1245
01:04:41,073 --> 01:04:43,073
No Justin, you don't...

1246
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:47,996
Jesus fucking Christ!

1247
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:49,899
Simon!

1248
01:04:49,999 --> 01:04:51,709
Simon.

1249
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:52,792
Simon?

1250
01:04:52,892 --> 01:04:54,377
Simon what the hell
are you doing?

1251
01:04:54,477 --> 01:04:56,607
Come back here and put your clothes
on, this instant!

1252
01:04:56,707 --> 01:04:57,823
I show you kissing him.

1253
01:04:57,923 --> 01:04:59,844
I wasn't kissing him.
I promise you.

1254
01:04:59,944 --> 01:05:02,172
What're you doing?
We're in a bloody funeral.

1255
01:05:02,272 --> 01:05:03,309
I'll jump.

1256
01:05:03,409 --> 01:05:05,149
- Don't be silly.
- I'll jump right now!

1257
01:05:05,249 --> 01:05:06,717
I swear to you.

1258
01:05:06,817 --> 01:05:07,697
Simon don't be like this.

1259
01:05:07,797 --> 01:05:10,610
Do you remember? Drugs.
You got drugs in you.

1260
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,413
Just calm down.

1261
01:05:12,513 --> 01:05:13,581
Simon, look at me.

1262
01:05:13,681 --> 01:05:16,739
Justin, will you get
the fuck out of here?!

1263
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:18,210
<i>I'm going to do it</i>

1264
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:19,912
<i>I will jump</i>

1265
01:05:20,012 --> 01:05:21,791
- Simon look at me!
- I swear I am

1266
01:05:21,891 --> 01:05:23,205
Please calm down.

1267
01:05:23,305 --> 01:05:26,110
- Simon, please.
- I'm gonna jump!

1268
01:05:26,426 --> 01:05:29,826
I'm going to jump...
I'm going to jump...

1269
01:05:31,046 --> 01:05:33,617
This is impossible we cannot do it.

1270
01:05:33,717 --> 01:05:35,074
<i>Howard?</i>

1271
01:05:35,174 --> 01:05:36,139
<i>Is that you?</i>

1272
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:36,878
Shit

1273
01:05:36,978 --> 01:05:37,720
<i>Are you in there?</i>

1274
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,420
Yeah.

1275
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,070
Hurry get him in the bathroom.

1276
01:05:44,597 --> 01:05:46,597
<i>Howard?</i>

1277
01:05:51,624 --> 01:05:53,624
- Oh shit
- What's that?

1278
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,975
Howard, what the fuck is Uncle Alfie
doing on the toilet?

1279
01:05:57,075 --> 01:05:57,881
I forgot him.

1280
01:05:57,981 --> 01:05:59,031
How could you forget?

1281
01:05:59,131 --> 01:06:00,159
What's wrong with you?

1282
01:06:00,259 --> 01:06:02,259
<i>Open the door</i>

1283
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:04,109
What is it?

1284
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:05,213
Hi, Daniel.
Where's Howard?

1285
01:06:05,313 --> 01:06:06,130
I'm here.

1286
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,784
Howard, come see this.

1287
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:10,604
Simon's totally fucking lost it.

1288
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,791
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

1289
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:17,545
Simon is on the roof.
He's totally fucking naked.

1290
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:19,128
He's threatening to jump.

1291
01:06:19,228 --> 01:06:19,952
Jesus.

1292
01:06:20,052 --> 01:06:20,816
Where are you going?

1293
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,001
I have to go out there.

1294
01:06:22,101 --> 01:06:23,878
If he jumps, I'm fucked.

1295
01:06:23,978 --> 01:06:25,978
Wait here.

1296
01:06:34,737 --> 01:06:36,490
<i>Simon, you're not going to jump.</i>

1297
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,100
I'll jump.
I'm not listening to you.

1298
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,240
<i>Simon, get back in here.</i>

1299
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:45,366
Simon come inside and
we'll have a cop of tea.

1300
01:06:45,466 --> 01:06:46,274
No.

1301
01:06:46,374 --> 01:06:47,276
Simon.

1302
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:49,376
Simon!

1303
01:06:55,566 --> 01:06:57,566
<i>Simon.</i>

1304
01:07:04,742 --> 01:07:05,559
Martha.

1305
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:07,589
What the hell are you doing?

1306
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:09,689
Simon.

1307
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:16,081
Martha!

1308
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,540
<i>Get down from there.</i>

1309
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:20,848
What's happening?

1310
01:07:20,948 --> 01:07:22,109
I think I can get rid
of this guy...

1311
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:23,650
...but I need you to stay outside...

1312
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:24,793
...and make sure no one comes in.

1313
01:07:24,893 --> 01:07:26,371
Okay.

1314
01:07:26,471 --> 01:07:28,471
<i>Martha.</i>

1315
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:32,866
Who is it?

1316
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,426
<i>It's Daniel</i>

1317
01:07:34,526 --> 01:07:36,457
Everyone's in the garden, we have
to move the body now.

1318
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:38,557
Brilliant.

1319
01:07:42,878 --> 01:07:44,878
Okay.
Quick.

1320
01:07:45,089 --> 01:07:45,705
Howard.

1321
01:07:45,805 --> 01:07:46,934
Stay here and make sure
no one comes in.

1322
01:07:47,034 --> 01:07:49,034
Okay.

1323
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,495
Hello Reverend.
How are you?

1324
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,885
How is God doing...today?

1325
01:08:03,043 --> 01:08:04,416
God is a funny one, isn't he?

1326
01:08:04,516 --> 01:08:05,276
Excuse me.

1327
01:08:05,376 --> 01:08:07,376
Yeah, okay

1328
01:08:07,952 --> 01:08:09,365
Daniel, we have to do this, right?

1329
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:11,465
Yeah.

1330
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:16,591
I wanted to ask you
about religion...

1331
01:08:16,691 --> 01:08:18,792
...and how could I become a priest
if I wanted to...

1332
01:08:18,892 --> 01:08:20,250
...because I've seen you today,
and you're amazing.

1333
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:22,350
I'm glad to hear that.

1334
01:08:22,935 --> 01:08:25,910
God, we can't leave them like that.

1335
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:32,244
You know, in a strange way, maybe this
is what Dad wanted.

1336
01:08:32,344 --> 01:08:34,903
For God's sake Robert.
Can't you take anything seriously?

1337
01:08:35,003 --> 01:08:38,137
Sundays, is it true...

1338
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,793
...the wine is sweeter...

1339
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,333
...or not?

1340
01:08:44,433 --> 01:08:46,492
Listen, we'll deal with this later.

1341
01:08:46,592 --> 01:08:49,057
I'd like to get to the phone.

1342
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:53,014
Why do you say I can't take
anything seriously?

1343
01:08:53,114 --> 01:08:53,917
I'll tell you why.

1344
01:08:54,017 --> 01:08:55,569
Because you disappear half way
around the world...

1345
01:08:55,669 --> 01:08:57,371
...and you hardly ever come back
to see your parents.

1346
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,930
Because you spend the last of
your money on a 1st class ticket...

1347
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:01,850
...when you know you're supposed
to give me the half for the funeral.

1348
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:04,514
Because you live your life as if you're
on a fairground...

1349
01:09:04,614 --> 01:09:08,569
...and 'cause you never ever, gave
a shit about anyone but yourself.

1350
01:09:08,669 --> 01:09:10,882
I didn't know anything about this
disturbed young man on the roof.

1351
01:09:10,982 --> 01:09:14,749
I have a confession to make.
I have these thoughts about...

1352
01:09:14,849 --> 01:09:17,059
...sticking a pen
up my bum.

1353
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:19,377
You're what?

1354
01:09:19,477 --> 01:09:22,197
Simon, this is really dangerous.

1355
01:09:23,271 --> 01:09:25,249
Please.

1356
01:09:25,349 --> 01:09:27,307
Leave me alone.

1357
01:09:27,407 --> 01:09:29,386
Sit there.

1358
01:09:46,872 --> 01:09:49,082
I'll never be good enough.

1359
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:52,850
Not for your dad, not for you
I'll never be rich enough...

1360
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:54,379
...I'll never be cool enough.

1361
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:56,838
Simon, stop talking this nonsense
and just come inside.

1362
01:09:56,938 --> 01:09:58,977
No, you go inside.

1363
01:09:59,322 --> 01:09:59,954
Come with me.

1364
01:10:00,054 --> 01:10:02,054
No. Why?

1365
01:10:05,115 --> 01:10:07,750
'Cause we're gonna have a baby.

1366
01:10:11,475 --> 01:10:13,475
What?

1367
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:16,956
We'll have a child together.

1368
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:22,392
You're pregnant?

1369
01:10:22,492 --> 01:10:25,637
How would I be able to it
without you?

1370
01:10:51,023 --> 01:10:55,273
- What's that? Excuse me.
- I don't know...Now look...

1371
01:10:59,639 --> 01:11:01,639
Bye Dad.

1372
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,340
We're gonna have a baby!

1373
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,639
Jesus.

1374
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:28,083
Listen to me everyone.
Simon is off the roof.

1375
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:30,183
I will kill him.

1376
01:11:43,042 --> 01:11:43,710
is he gone?

1377
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:45,378
Yeah.

1378
01:11:45,478 --> 01:11:47,478
Thank God.

1379
01:11:54,305 --> 01:11:55,178
Thank you.

1380
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:56,691
<i>Martha!</i>

1381
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:58,791
<i>Martha, open the door.</i>

1382
01:12:02,194 --> 01:12:04,086
Thank God, you're safe.

1383
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:07,055
You idiot.
What were you thinking?!

1384
01:12:07,155 --> 01:12:09,236
I want you to stay away
from my daughter.

1385
01:12:09,336 --> 01:12:09,973
Look Dad...

1386
01:12:10,073 --> 01:12:11,042
Martha, stay out of this.

1387
01:12:11,142 --> 01:12:12,949
Dad, we're getting married.

1388
01:12:13,049 --> 01:12:13,825
What?

1389
01:12:13,925 --> 01:12:15,925
We're getting married.

1390
01:12:17,961 --> 01:12:19,118
Martha.

1391
01:12:19,218 --> 01:12:21,861
You don't have to marry this man
just because you're pregnant.

1392
01:12:21,961 --> 01:12:23,225
We can deal with this Martha.

1393
01:12:23,325 --> 01:12:25,994
I'm marrying him because
I love him.

1394
01:12:26,094 --> 01:12:27,738
- You can't
- Yes, I can.

1395
01:12:27,838 --> 01:12:29,189
It's my life and this
is my choice.

1396
01:12:29,289 --> 01:12:34,049
And I'm sorry if you don't like it
but that's just tough.

1397
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:36,231
And I will tell you
something else.

1398
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:38,339
If you don't short out
your attitude...

1399
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:42,774
...you're gonna end up a very lonely
bitter old man.

1400
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,260
Dad.

1401
01:12:53,343 --> 01:12:55,528
Darling, we really must
start again now.

1402
01:12:55,628 --> 01:12:57,944
Daniel, have you seen
Uncle Alfie?

1403
01:12:58,044 --> 01:13:00,044
Shit

1404
01:13:11,997 --> 01:13:13,600
What the hell is going on
in there?

1405
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,725
Sorry we forgot you.

1406
01:13:14,825 --> 01:13:16,868
Never mind that. What about that dead
body, you were dragging over there?

1407
01:13:16,968 --> 01:13:17,923
What dead body?

1408
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:21,140
Don't fuck with me.
I saw a dead body!

1409
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,441
Get me the hell of this
fucking toilet!

1410
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:38,877
Did you hear that?
She's having a kid.

1411
01:13:38,977 --> 01:13:40,620
I would have done it, if I didn't
know she was having a kid.

1412
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,385
I thought you were in
love with her.

1413
01:13:41,485 --> 01:13:44,209
Yeah, but can you imagine me
bringing up a kid?

1414
01:13:44,309 --> 01:13:44,952
No.

1415
01:13:45,052 --> 01:13:45,940
Exactly.

1416
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:46,970
How's your skin thing?

1417
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:47,768
Oh, that...

1418
01:13:47,868 --> 01:13:49,311
It's probably nothing.
To be honest, I'm more concerned about

1419
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:53,321
...about having Uncle Alfie's shit
in my mouth.

1420
01:14:04,683 --> 01:14:05,670
<i>He was dead.</i>

1421
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:08,455
<i>Why don't you listen, I tell
you, I saw the guy.</i>

1422
01:14:08,555 --> 01:14:09,552
He was dead.

1423
01:14:09,652 --> 01:14:12,864
<i>I know you did Uncle Alfie.
We all did.</i>

1424
01:14:12,964 --> 01:14:15,426
No, in the bathroom. The door
opened and I saw him.

1425
01:14:15,526 --> 01:14:18,064
What a nightmare today's been.

1426
01:14:18,164 --> 01:14:19,894
But exciting, isn't it?

1427
01:14:19,994 --> 01:14:22,049
- What?
- For a funeral I mean.

1428
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:23,792
About the flat, I promised to call them.

1429
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,892
And I will.

1430
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:28,008
We'll work it out.

1431
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:30,403
We really have to wheeze
through this now.

1432
01:14:30,503 --> 01:14:31,206
Alright. Let's go.

1433
01:14:31,306 --> 01:14:32,322
You want to have the casket open
for people...

1434
01:14:32,422 --> 01:14:33,310
No.

1435
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:34,295
Alright. That's fine.

1436
01:14:34,395 --> 01:14:37,241
Sit down everybody, as quick as
you can. We're ready to go.

1437
01:14:37,341 --> 01:14:39,341
Come along. Come on.

1438
01:14:40,826 --> 01:14:42,559
That's it.

1439
01:14:42,659 --> 01:14:43,718
Quickly!

1440
01:14:43,818 --> 01:14:45,181
Come on, come on...

1441
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:47,281
Come on!

1442
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:49,667
Come on!
Come on!

1443
01:14:51,895 --> 01:14:54,570
I'd like to apologise on behalf of the
family for all of the distractions...

1444
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:56,990
...and that everyone is ready to
continue with the service...

1445
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:58,779
...and Daniel would like to say a few
words about his father.

1446
01:14:58,879 --> 01:15:00,879
Go on Daniel. Quickly.

1447
01:15:16,882 --> 01:15:20,150
My father was an
exceptional man.

1448
01:15:20,151 --> 01:15:22,151
(knocking)

1449
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:43,583
My father was an
exceptional man.

1450
01:15:43,584 --> 01:15:45,584
(knocking)

1451
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:56,271
He was born in 1938
just a year before the war.

1452
01:15:56,371 --> 01:15:57,411
And I'll never forget...

1453
01:15:57,512 --> 01:15:59,712
(knocking)

1454
01:16:00,166 --> 01:16:01,692
What the hell is going on?

1455
01:16:01,792 --> 01:16:03,274
There's someone in there.

1456
01:16:03,374 --> 01:16:05,374
I knew it!

1457
01:16:13,678 --> 01:16:16,389
What the hell are you doing
in my dad's coffin?

1458
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:19,852
Edward.

1459
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,340
No, no...

1460
01:16:23,755 --> 01:16:24,920
Edward.

1461
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:25,899
Edward!

1462
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:32,415
No.

1463
01:16:45,658 --> 01:16:47,813
You little bastard!

1464
01:16:51,743 --> 01:16:53,189
Oh God.

1465
01:16:53,289 --> 01:16:56,094
My father was an exceptional man.

1466
01:17:19,173 --> 01:17:21,978
He may not have been
a perfect man.

1467
01:17:22,276 --> 01:17:24,347
But he was a good man.

1468
01:17:25,648 --> 01:17:27,648
And he loved us.

1469
01:17:32,013 --> 01:17:33,400
All I wanted to do today
was to give him a dignified...

1470
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:36,985
...sending.
Is that really so much to ask?

1471
01:17:42,634 --> 01:17:44,634
So...

1472
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:48,449
Maybe...

1473
01:17:49,924 --> 01:17:52,822
Maybe he had some things
he liked to do.

1474
01:17:52,922 --> 01:17:55,897
Life isn't simple.
It's complicated.

1475
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,631
We're all just thrown in
here together...

1476
01:18:00,731 --> 01:18:04,216
...in a world full of chaos and
confusion.

1477
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:07,696
A world full of questions and
no answers.

1478
01:18:07,796 --> 01:18:10,394
With Death always lingering
around the corner.

1479
01:18:10,494 --> 01:18:12,494
And we do our best.

1480
01:18:14,518 --> 01:18:16,510
We can't always do our best.

1481
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:18,995
My dad did it best.

1482
01:18:30,993 --> 01:18:32,890
He always tried to tell me you
have to go for what you want in life...

1483
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,644
...because you never know how long
you're gonna be here.

1484
01:18:34,744 --> 01:18:38,251
And whether you succeed
or you fail...

1485
01:18:39,674 --> 01:18:43,414
...the most important thing
is to have tried.

1486
01:18:44,538 --> 01:18:48,091
A parent can only drive you in the
right direction. In the end though...

1487
01:18:48,191 --> 01:18:51,081
...you've got to run for yourself.

1488
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:56,615
You have to grow up yourself.

1489
01:19:01,907 --> 01:19:04,457
So when you leave
here today...

1490
01:19:05,475 --> 01:19:10,575
...I'd like you to remember my father
for what he really was.

1491
01:19:10,904 --> 01:19:13,294
A decent and loving man.

1492
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:21,496
If only we could be as
giving and generous..

1493
01:19:22,252 --> 01:19:25,397
...and understanding
as my father was.

1494
01:19:26,589 --> 01:19:30,159
Then the world would be a far
better place.

1495
01:20:07,654 --> 01:20:09,654
How's Mom?

1496
01:20:11,052 --> 01:20:13,052
She'll survive.

1497
01:20:16,226 --> 01:20:17,932
The positive side is...

1498
01:20:18,032 --> 01:20:23,217
...that she knows why she and Dad
haven't had sex for so long.

1499
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:28,987
I asked to come to New York
with me, for a while.

1500
01:20:29,087 --> 01:20:32,829
So that you and Jane have a chance...
to breathe a bit.

1501
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:34,929
Get a flat...

1502
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:43,112
Pretty good speech you gave,
by the way.

1503
01:20:43,212 --> 01:20:45,217
It was really...

1504
01:20:49,794 --> 01:20:51,794
...impressive.

1505
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:54,781
Thanks.

1506
01:20:58,116 --> 01:21:01,045
Maybe when you got time
you wouldn't mind...

1507
01:21:01,145 --> 01:21:03,412
...taking a look at my novel.

1508
01:21:03,512 --> 01:21:05,512
I'd love to, yeah.

1509
01:21:13,232 --> 01:21:15,232
I'm exhausted actually.

1510
01:21:15,445 --> 01:21:18,656
Uncle Alfie keeps going on
about the body in the bathroom.

1511
01:21:18,756 --> 01:21:20,870
It's best if he stays
here tonight.

1512
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:22,971
You think he'll be okay?

1513
01:21:23,071 --> 01:21:28,982
Yeah, he'll be fine. I found him a
couple of Valium and put him to bed.

1514
01:21:30,133 --> 01:21:32,768
Everything's so
fucking green...
