1
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,681
For more than a year, ominous rumors
had been privately circulating...

2
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:48,187
among high-level Western leaders...

3
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:52,124
that the Soviet Union had been at work
on what was darkly hinted to be...

4
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:55,890
the ultimate weapon:
a doomsday device.

5
00:00:55,964 --> 00:00:59,866
Intelligence sources traced the site
of the top-secret Russian project...

6
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,630
to the perpetually
fog-shrouded wasteland...

7
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:06,105
below the Arctic peaks
of the Zhokhov Islands.

8
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:11,510
What they were building or why it was
located in a remote, desolate place...

9
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,843
no one could say.

10
00:03:44,132 --> 00:03:45,599
General Ripper, sir.

11
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:47,600
Group Captain Mandrake speaking.

12
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,659
This is General Ripper speaking.

13
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:51,932
- Yes, sir.
- Do you recognize my voice?

14
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:54,406
I do, sir. Why do you ask?

15
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:56,238
Why do you think?

16
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,905
I don't know, sir. We spoke
just a few moments ago, didn't we?

17
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:05,214
You don't think I'd ask unless it was
pretty damned important, do you?

18
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,719
No, I don't.

19
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,983
Let's see if we can stay on the ball.

20
00:04:09,924 --> 00:04:12,518
Has the Wing confirmed holding
at their fail-safe points?

21
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:15,426
Yes, sir. The confirmations
have just come in.

22
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:19,125
Very well.
Now, listen to me carefully.

23
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,998
The base is being put on condition red.

24
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,299
I want this flashed
to all sections immediately.

25
00:04:24,372 --> 00:04:27,705
Condition red. Jolly good.
Keeps the men on their toes.

26
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,039
This is not an exercise.

27
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:32,977
Not an exercise?

28
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:39,312
I shouldn't tell you this, but you're
a good officer and have a right to know.

29
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:41,321
It looks like we're in a shooting war.

30
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:47,283
- Oh, hell. Are the Russians involved?
- That's all I've been told.

31
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:52,128
It came in on the red phone. I'm gonna
follow orders and seal this base tight.

32
00:04:53,234 --> 00:04:56,761
Now, I want you to transmit Plan R...

33
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,772
R for Robert, to the Wing.

34
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,241
- Plan R for Robert.
- Is it that bad, sir?

35
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,801
- Looks like it's pretty hairy.
- Yes, sir.

36
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,904
Plan R for Robert.

37
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:10,314
Last and possibly most important...

38
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:14,616
I want all privately owned radios
to be immediately impounded.

39
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,625
They might be used to issue
instructions to saboteurs.

40
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,560
As I previously arranged, Air Police
will have lists of all owners.

41
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,622
I want every one collected
without exception.

42
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,998
After you've done that,
report back to me.

43
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,791
In order to guard against
surprise nuclear attack...

44
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:01,301
America's Strategic Air Command
maintains...

45
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:05,499
a large force of B-52 bombers
airborne 24 hours a day.

46
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:10,476
Each B-52 can deliver
a nuclear bomb load of 50 megatons...

47
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:15,572
equal to 16 times the total
explosive force of all the bombs...

48
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,212
and shells used by all the armies
in World War II.

49
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:23,416
Based in America,
the Airborne Alert Force...

50
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:26,289
is deployed from the Persian Gulf
to the Arctic Ocean.

51
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,158
But they have one geographical factor
in common.

52
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,189
They are all two hours
from their targets inside Russia.

53
00:07:53,214 --> 00:07:56,206
Major Kong, I know you'll think
this is crazy...

54
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:59,946
but I just got a message from base
over the C.R.M. 114.

55
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,981
It decodes as Wing attack Plan R.
R for Romeo.

56
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:12,361
Goldie, did you say
Wing attack Plan R?

57
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:13,957
Yes, sir, I have.

58
00:08:17,772 --> 00:08:22,471
Goldie, how many times have
I told you guys that I don't want...

59
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,477
horsin' around on the airplane?

60
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,809
I'm not horsing around.
That's how it decodes.

61
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,543
I've been to one world fair,
a picnic...

62
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:33,485
and a rodeo, and that's the stupidest
thing I heard over earphones.

63
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,454
You sure you got today's code?

64
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,983
Yes, sir.

65
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,619
There's gotta be something wrong.

66
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:43,060
Wait a second, I'm coming back.

67
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:21,194
Maybe you'd better get
a confirmation from base.

68
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:22,701
Yes, sir.

69
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:46,418
Major Kong, is it possible
this is some kind of loyalty test?

70
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:50,157
You know, give the go code and then
recall to see who would actually go?

71
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:54,361
Ain't nobody ever got
the go code yet.

72
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:56,835
Old Ripper wouldn't be giving us
Plan R...

73
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:59,532
unless them Ruskies had already
clobbered Washington...

74
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:01,905
and a lot of other towns
with a sneak attack.

75
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,238
Yes, sir.

76
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,801
Major Kong,
message from base confirmed.

77
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,017
Well, boys, I reckon this is it.

78
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:17,353
Nuclear combat toe-to-toe
with the Ruskies.

79
00:10:32,406 --> 00:10:37,275
Boys, I ain't much of a hand
at making speeches.

80
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:42,011
But I got a fair idea
that something doggone important...

81
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:44,073
is going on back there.

82
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:48,019
I've got a fair idea of the kind
of personal emotions...

83
00:10:48,088 --> 00:10:51,546
that some of you fellows
may be thinking.

84
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,355
Heck, I reckon you wouldn't be
human beings...

85
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:59,024
if you didn't have pretty strong
personal feelings about nuclear combat.

86
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:02,034
I want you to remember one thing.

87
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:04,866
The folks back home
are counting on you.

88
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:07,271
And by golly,
we ain't about to let them down.

89
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:11,407
Tell you something else.

90
00:11:11,478 --> 00:11:16,472
If this thing turns out to be half
as important as I figure it might be...

91
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,577
I'd say you're all in line
for some important promotions...

92
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:24,454
and personal citations
when this thing's over with.

93
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:27,289
That goes for every last one of you...

94
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:31,195
regardless of your race,
color or your creed.

95
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:34,826
Now let's get this thing on the hump.
We got some flying to do.

96
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,679
Buck, should I get it?

97
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,685
Yeah, you'll have to.

98
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:00,389
Hello?

99
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:05,057
Yes, General Turgidson is here,
but he can't come to the phone now.

100
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:07,396
This is his secretary, Miss Scott.

101
00:12:08,535 --> 00:12:10,730
Freddie, how are you?

102
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:13,068
Fine. And you?

103
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:17,804
Oh, we were just catching up
on some of the general's paperwork.

104
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:22,508
He's tied up.
I'm afraid he can't come to the phone.

105
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:25,017
Just a minute.

106
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:28,350
General Turgidson,
a Colonel Puntrich calling.

107
00:12:28,422 --> 00:12:30,356
Tell him to call back.

108
00:12:30,424 --> 00:12:35,123
Freddie, the general says
could you call back in a minute?

109
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:37,129
He says it can't wait.

110
00:12:37,197 --> 00:12:40,530
For Pete's--
Find out what he wants.

111
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:44,503
The general is in the powder room
right now.

112
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:46,835
Could you tell me what it's about?

113
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:52,371
Just a second. Apparently they monitored
a transmission eight minutes ago...

114
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,937
from Burpelson Air Force Base.

115
00:12:56,784 --> 00:13:01,847
Right. It was directed to
the 843rd Bomb Wing on airborne alert.

116
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:07,082
It decoded as Wing attack Plan R.

117
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:12,827
Well, tell him to call what's-his-name,
Base Commander Ripper.

118
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,561
Do I have to think of everything?

119
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:19,231
The general suggests you call General
Ripper, the 843rd base commander.

120
00:13:19,306 --> 00:13:22,707
Oh. All communications are dead!

121
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:26,177
Bull! Tell him to do it himself.

122
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:31,183
The general asks if you could
possibly try again yourself.

123
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:35,915
I see. He says he's tried personally
several times, but everything is dead.

124
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:38,753
Even the normal phone lines
are shut down.

125
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,866
Fred? Buck.
What's it look like?

126
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:51,904
Yeah?

127
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,332
Well, are you sure
it's Plan R?

128
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:00,274
Huh. What's cooking
on the threat board?

129
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:03,145
Nothing? Nothing at all?

130
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,378
I don't like the look of this.

131
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,484
Tell you what you better do,
old buddy.

132
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:14,721
You better give Elmo and Charlie a blast
and bump everything up to condition red.

133
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:17,355
Stand by the blower.
I'll get back to you.

134
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:19,626
- What's up?
- Nothing.

135
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:24,500
- Where's my shorts?
- On the floor. Where are you going?

136
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,334
No place.

137
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:31,140
I thought I might mosey over to the
War Room to see what's doing over there.

138
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:33,008
It's 3:00 in the morning.

139
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,014
The air force never sleeps.

140
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:39,018
Buck, honey, I'm not sleepy either.

141
00:14:41,688 --> 00:14:44,486
I know how it is, baby.

142
00:14:44,558 --> 00:14:46,583
Tell you what you do.

143
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:51,587
You start your countdown
and old Bucky will be back...

144
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:55,226
before you can say "Blastoff!"

145
00:14:56,503 --> 00:15:00,599
Your Commie has no regard
for human life, not even his own.

146
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:05,609
For this reason, men, I want
to impress upon you the need...

147
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,772
for extreme watchfullness.

148
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:11,875
The enemy may come individually
or he may come in strength.

149
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,546
He may even come in the uniform
of our own troops.

150
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:18,116
But however he comes,
we must stop him.

151
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:20,956
We must not allow him
to gain entrance to this base.

152
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:26,432
Now, I am going to give you
three simple rules.

153
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,994
First: Trust no one,
whatever his uniform or rank...

154
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,562
unless he is known to you personally.

155
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,507
Secondly: Anyone or anything...

156
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:41,480
that approaches within 200 yards
of the perimeter is to be fired upon.

157
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:47,180
Third: If in doubt, shoot first
and ask questions afterwards.

158
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:50,621
I would sooner accept a few casualties
through accident...

159
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:54,821
than lose the entire base
and its personnel through carelessness.

160
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:59,025
Any variation on these rules
must come from me personally.

161
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,933
Now, men, in conclusion...

162
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:07,064
I would like to say
that in the two years...

163
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,940
that it has been my privilege
to be your commanding officer...

164
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,946
I have always expected
the best from you...

165
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,916
and you have never given me
anything less than that.

166
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:21,352
Today the nation is counting on us.

167
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:25,255
We are not going to let them down.

168
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:27,259
Good luck to you all.

169
00:16:57,457 --> 00:16:59,982
Here's the attack profile, sir.

170
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:30,416
This is your attack profile.

171
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,584
"To ensure that the enemy cannot monitor
voice transmission...

172
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,821
or plant false transmission...

173
00:17:35,896 --> 00:17:41,027
the C.R.M. 114 is to be switched
into all receiver circuits.

174
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,559
The emergency base code prefix
is to be set...

175
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:47,038
on the dials of the C.R.M.

176
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:51,669
This will block any transmission other
than those preceded by a code prefix."

177
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:55,407
Stand by to set code prefix.

178
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:57,950
Roger. Ready to set code prefix.

179
00:17:58,018 --> 00:17:59,883
"Set code prefix."

180
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:10,862
Code prefix set.

181
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:12,592
"Lock code prefix."

182
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:16,701
Code prefix locked.

183
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,262
"Switch all receiver circuits
to C.R.M. discriminators."

184
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,706
Switched to C.R.M. discriminators.

185
00:18:24,778 --> 00:18:26,643
"Check auto destruct circuits."

186
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,884
Auto destruct circuits checked.

187
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,693
"Primary target:
the I.C.B.M. complex at Laputa.

188
00:18:41,762 --> 00:18:45,994
Target reference:
Yankee, golf, tango...

189
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:48,125
3-6-0.

190
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:50,135
Thirty megaton nuclear device...

191
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:54,299
fused for air burst at 10,000 feet.

192
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:58,868
Twenty megaton nuclear device
will be used if first malfunctions.

193
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:01,607
Otherwise, proceed to secondary target:

194
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:05,709
missile complex seven miles east
of Borchov.

195
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:09,745
Target reference:
November, Bravo, X-ray...

196
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:12,291
1-0-8.

197
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:17,661
Fused air burst at 10--"
Check-- "12,000 feet."

198
00:19:28,975 --> 00:19:32,877
Excuse me, sir. Something rather
interesting has just cropped up.

199
00:19:32,946 --> 00:19:35,779
Listen to that. Music.
Civilian broadcasting.

200
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:41,650
I think the Pentagon has given us
an exercise to check our readiness.

201
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,713
I think it's taking things too far.

202
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,816
Our fellows will be inside Russian
radar cover in about 20 minutes.

203
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:50,124
Listen. Chock full of stations
all churning it out.

204
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:53,661
- Mandrake?
- Yes, sir?

205
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,170
I issued instructions for all radios
to be impounded.

206
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:01,537
You did, and I was in the process of
impounding this when I switched it on.

207
00:20:01,608 --> 00:20:05,100
I thought our fellows hitting Russian
radar, dropping all their stuff...

208
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:09,638
I'd better tell you because if they do,
it'll cause a stink.

209
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:13,777
Group Captain,
the officer exchange program...

210
00:20:13,854 --> 00:20:17,483
does not give you any special
prerogatives to question my orders.

211
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:21,789
I realize that, sir, but I thought
you'd be pleased to hear the news.

212
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:24,626
After all, let's face it.

213
00:20:24,698 --> 00:20:28,691
We don't want to start a nuclear war
unless we have to, do we?

214
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:33,332
Please sit down.
And turn that thing off.

215
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:34,532
Yes, sir.

216
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:39,511
What about the planes? Surely we must
issue the recall code immediately.

217
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:42,446
The planes are not going
to be recalled.

218
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:45,383
My attack orders have been issued,
and the orders stand.

219
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,584
If you'll excuse me for saying so,
that would be to my way of thinking...

220
00:20:51,658 --> 00:20:53,819
rather an odd way of looking at it

221
00:20:53,894 --> 00:20:56,294
If a Russian attack was in progress...

222
00:20:56,363 --> 00:21:00,299
we would certainly not be hearing
civilian broadcasting.

223
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:03,234
- Are you certain?
- I'm absolutely positive.

224
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,033
What if it is true?

225
00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:09,132
I'm afraid I'm still not with you, sir,
because I mean...

226
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,076
if a Russian attack
was not in progress...

227
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:17,515
then your use of Plan R-- In fact,
your orders to the entire Wing--

228
00:21:24,991 --> 00:21:30,258
I would say, sir, that there was
something dreadfully wrong somewhere

229
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,697
Why don't you take it easy,
Group Captain?

230
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:36,429
Please make me a drink
of grain alcohol and rainwater...

231
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,937
and help yourself
to whatever you'd like.

232
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:52,077
General Ripper, sir, as an officer
in Her Majesty's Air Force...

233
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:55,417
it is my clear duty
under the present circumstances...

234
00:21:55,488 --> 00:22:00,187
to issue the recall code upon my
own authority and bring back the Wing.

235
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,251
If you'll excuse me, sir.

236
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:15,774
Sir, I must ask you for the key and the
recall code. Have you got them handy?

237
00:22:15,842 --> 00:22:18,333
I told you to take it easy,
Group Captain.

238
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:20,971
There's nothing anybody can do now.

239
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:23,481
I'm the only person who knows
the three-letter code group.

240
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,110
I must insist
that you give them to me!

241
00:22:35,195 --> 00:22:39,188
Do I take it, sir, you are threatening
a brother officer with a gun?

242
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:45,598
Mandrake, I suppose
it never occurred to you...

243
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:49,267
that while we're chatting here
so enjoyably...

244
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:53,210
a decision is being made
by the president...

245
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,443
and the joint chiefs in the War Room
at the Pentagon.

246
00:22:57,517 --> 00:23:03,114
When they realize there is
no possibility of recalling the Wing...

247
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:07,489
there will be only one course
of action open.

248
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,460
Total commitment.

249
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:16,168
Mandrake, do you recall what
Clemenceau once said about war?

250
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,166
No, I don't think I do, sir. No.

251
00:23:21,841 --> 00:23:24,867
He said war was too important
to be left to the generals.

252
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:30,542
When he said that 50 years ago...

253
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,585
he might have been right.

254
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:35,018
But today...

255
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:38,546
war is too important
to be left to politicians.

256
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:43,085
They have neither the time,
the training...

257
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:46,223
nor the inclination
for strategic thought.

258
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:53,361
I can no longer sit back
and allow...

259
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,605
Communist infiltration,
Communist indoctrination...

260
00:23:58,678 --> 00:24:00,305
Communist subversion...

261
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:05,649
and the international
Communist conspiracy...

262
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:08,586
to sap and impurify...

263
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,988
all of our precious
bodily fluids.

264
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:19,654
Staines, is everybody here?

265
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:22,224
Mr.President, the secretary of state
is in Vietnam.

266
00:24:22,302 --> 00:24:26,261
The secretary of defense is in Laos, and
the vice president is in Mexico City.

267
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:31,299
We can establish contact with them at
anytime. The undersecretaries are here.

268
00:24:31,378 --> 00:24:34,472
Right. General Turgidson,
what's going on?

269
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,576
Mr.President...

270
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:42,314
about 35 minutes ago...

271
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:46,382
General Jack Ripper,
the commanding general...

272
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:48,893
of Burpelson Air Force Base...

273
00:24:48,962 --> 00:24:52,227
issued an order to the 34 B-52s
of his Wing...

274
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:54,425
which were airborne at the time...

275
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:58,631
as part of a special exercise we were
holding called Operation Dropkick.

276
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:03,404
It appears that the order
called for the planes...

277
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:06,843
to attack their targets
inside Russia.

278
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:11,145
The planes are fully armed
with nuclear weapons...

279
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:14,744
with an average load
of 40 megatons each.

280
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:19,281
The central display of Russia will
indicate the position of the planes.

281
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,991
The triangles
are their primary targets.

282
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,999
The squares
are their secondary targets.

283
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:33,370
The aircraft will begin penetrating
Russian radar cover within 25 minutes.

284
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:38,874
General Turgidson, I find this
very difficult to understand.

285
00:25:38,945 --> 00:25:44,212
I understood I was the only one
to order the use of nuclear weapons.

286
00:25:45,351 --> 00:25:49,447
That's right, sir. You are
the only person authorized to do so.

287
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:53,822
And although I hate to judge
before all the facts are in...

288
00:25:53,893 --> 00:25:57,522
it's beginning to look like
General Ripper exceeded his authority.

289
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:02,466
It certainly does, far beyond the point
I would have imagined possible.

290
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:06,164
Perhaps you're forgetting
the provisions of Plan R, sir.

291
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:08,070
Plan R?

292
00:26:09,476 --> 00:26:13,037
Plan R is an emergency war plan...

293
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,638
in which a lower echelon commander
may order...

294
00:26:15,715 --> 00:26:18,843
nuclear retaliation
after a sneak attack...

295
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:22,410
if the normal chain of command
has been disrupted.

296
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:25,390
You approved it, sir.
You must remember.

297
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:30,760
Surely you must recall, sir,
when Senator Beaufort made...

298
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,799
that big hassle about our deterrent
lacking credibility.

299
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:38,600
The idea was for Plan R to be
a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

300
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:40,662
A safeguard?

301
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,005
I admit the human element seems
to have failed us here.

302
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:47,478
But the idea was to discourage
the Ruskies from any hope...

303
00:26:47,547 --> 00:26:52,143
they could knock out Washington, and
yourself, as part of a sneak attack...

304
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:56,416
and escape retaliation because of lack
of proper command and control.

305
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,185
I assume the planes will return
automatically...

306
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:01,284
once they reach their fail-safe points.

307
00:27:02,395 --> 00:27:06,923
I'm afraid not. The planes were holding
at their fail-safe points...

308
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,025
when the go code was issued.

309
00:27:09,102 --> 00:27:13,596
Once they fly beyond fail-safe, they do
not require a second order to proceed.

310
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,607
They will continue
until they reach their target.

311
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,735
Then why haven't you radioed the planes,
countermanding the go code?

312
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:23,439
We're unable to communicate
with any of the aircraft.

313
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,711
Why?

314
00:27:25,785 --> 00:27:28,185
As you may recall, sir...

315
00:27:28,254 --> 00:27:31,883
one of the provisions
of Plan R provides...

316
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:36,554
that once the go code
is received...

317
00:27:36,629 --> 00:27:39,962
the normal S.S.B. radios
in the aircraft...

318
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,501
are switched into
a special coded device...

319
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:45,629
which I believe is designated
as C.R.M. 114.

320
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:50,142
In order to prevent the enemy
from issuing fake or confusing orders...

321
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,146
C.R.M. 114 is designed
not to receive at all...

322
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:59,743
unless the message is proceeded by the
correct three-letter code group prefix.

323
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:05,189
You mean to tell me you will be unable
to recall the aircraft?

324
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:08,193
That's the size of it.
However, we are plowing through...

325
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:11,162
every possible three-letter combination
of the code.

326
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:16,430
But since there are
17,000 permutations...

327
00:28:16,502 --> 00:28:20,097
it's going to take us about two
and a half days to transmit them all.

328
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:22,937
How soon will the planes penetrate
Russian radar cover?

329
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:26,501
- About 18 minutes from now.
- Are you in contact with General Ripper?

330
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:31,482
No, sir. General Ripper sealed off
the base and cut off communications.

331
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:33,178
Where did you get this information?

332
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,848
General Ripper called
Strategic Air Command Headquarters...

333
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,448
shortly after he issued the go code.

334
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:43,154
I have a portion of the conversation
transcript if you'd like me to read it.

335
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:44,992
Read it.

336
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,563
The duty officer asked
General Ripper...

337
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:52,901
to confirm the fact that he had
issued the go code and he said:

338
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:58,206
"Yes, gentlemen, they are on their way
in and no one can bring them back.

339
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:01,076
For the sake of our country
and our way of life...

340
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:03,843
I suggest you get the rest of SAC
in after them.

341
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:08,819
Otherwise, we will be totally destroyed
by Red retaliation.

342
00:29:08,888 --> 00:29:14,190
My boys will give you the best kind
of start: 1,400 megatons worth.

343
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,821
And you sure as hell
won't stop them now.

344
00:29:17,897 --> 00:29:20,764
So let's get going.
There's no other choice.

345
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:25,702
God willing, we will prevail
in peace and freedom from fear...

346
00:29:25,772 --> 00:29:29,173
and in true health
through the purity...

347
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:33,110
and essence of our natural...

348
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:34,612
fluids.

349
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:37,606
God bless you all."

350
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:42,180
Then he hung up.

351
00:29:42,255 --> 00:29:45,850
We're still trying to figure out
the meaning of that last phrase, sir.

352
00:29:45,925 --> 00:29:50,259
There's nothing to figure out.
This man is obviously a psychotic.

353
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,427
I'd like to hold off judgment
until all the facts are in.

354
00:29:55,501 --> 00:30:00,097
General Turgidson, when you instituted
the human reliability tests...

355
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,109
you assured me there was no possibility
of such a thing ever occurring.

356
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,140
Well, I don't think it's fair
to condemn a whole program...

357
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:12,878
because of a single slipup, sir.

358
00:30:12,952 --> 00:30:15,477
I want to speak to General Ripper
on the telephone.

359
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:17,079
That's impossible.

360
00:30:17,156 --> 00:30:21,058
General Turgidson, I am becoming
less and less interested...

361
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:24,688
in your estimates
of what is possible and impossible.

362
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,298
General Faceman.

363
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,527
Yes, sir?

364
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:30,967
Are there any army units
stationed near Burpelson?

365
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,096
I'll just check, sir.

366
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:39,377
Hello?

367
00:30:40,947 --> 00:30:44,178
I told you never to call me here.
Don't you know where I am?

368
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:49,248
Look, baby, I can't talk to you now.

369
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:51,882
My president needs me.

370
00:30:51,958 --> 00:30:55,587
Of course Bucky would rather
be there with you.

371
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:59,825
Of course it isn't only physical.

372
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,367
I deeply respect you
as a human being.

373
00:31:02,435 --> 00:31:05,529
Someday I'm going to make you
Mrs. Buck Turgidson.

374
00:31:06,706 --> 00:31:09,641
Oh, listen, you go back to sleep.

375
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:12,678
Bucky will be there as soon as he can.

376
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:17,341
All right. Listen, don't forget
to say your prayers.

377
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:28,293
Apparently,
the 23rd Airborne Division...

378
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:31,194
is stationed seven miles away
at Alvarado.

379
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:35,530
General Faceman, I want them to enter
the base, locate General Ripper...

380
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:37,967
and put him in immediate
telephone contact with me.

381
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:39,664
Yes, sir.

382
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:41,400
Mr.President?

383
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:43,066
If I may advise.

384
00:31:43,142 --> 00:31:47,408
Under a condition red, it is standard
procedure that the base be sealed off...

385
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,244
and the base defended
by base security troops.

386
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:54,753
Any force trying to enter would
certainly encounter heavy casualties.

387
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:58,882
General Turgidson, with all due respect
for your defense team...

388
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,688
my boys can brush them aside
without too much trouble.

389
00:32:02,628 --> 00:32:07,395
Mr.President, there are one or two
points I'd like to make, if I may?

390
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:09,867
Go ahead, General.

391
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:16,034
One: Our hopes for recalling
the 843rd Bomb Wing...

392
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:20,408
are quickly being reduced
to a very low order of probability.

393
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,506
Two: In less than 15 minutes
from now...

394
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,575
the Ruskies will be making
radar contact with the planes.

395
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:28,643
Three: When they do...

396
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:32,350
they will go absolutely ape and
strike back with everything they've got.

397
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:36,327
Four: If prior to this time...

398
00:32:36,395 --> 00:32:39,853
we have done nothing to suppress
their retaliatory capabilities...

399
00:32:39,932 --> 00:32:43,595
we will suffer virtual annihilation.

400
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:51,336
Five: If, on the other hand...

401
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:58,548
we immediately launched an attack
on their airfields and missile bases...

402
00:32:58,618 --> 00:33:01,815
we'd stand a damn good chance
of catching them with their pants down.

403
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:04,254
Hell, we've got
a five-to-one missile superiority.

404
00:33:04,323 --> 00:33:07,087
We could easily assign three missiles
to every target...

405
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:10,560
and still have a very effective reserve
force for any other contingency.

406
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:16,000
Six: An unofficial study which
we undertook of this eventuality...

407
00:33:16,068 --> 00:33:21,005
indicated that we would destroy
90% of their nuclear capabilities.

408
00:33:21,073 --> 00:33:23,200
We would therefore prevail...

409
00:33:23,276 --> 00:33:26,473
and suffer only modest and acceptable
civilian casualties...

410
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,983
from their remaining force which would
be badly damaged and uncoordinated.

411
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,508
General, it is the avowed policy
of our country...

412
00:33:34,587 --> 00:33:36,748
never to strike first
with nuclear weapons.

413
00:33:36,822 --> 00:33:41,521
Well, Mr.President, General Ripper
has already invalidated that policy.

414
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:46,031
That was not an act of national policy.
There are still alternatives open to us.

415
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:51,868
Mr.President, we are rapidly
approaching a moment of truth...

416
00:33:51,938 --> 00:33:55,101
both for ourselves as human beings
and for the life of our nation.

417
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:57,802
Truth is not always a pleasant thing.

418
00:33:57,877 --> 00:34:00,437
But it is necessary now
to make a choice:

419
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:03,277
to choose between two admittedly
regrettable...

420
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:06,807
but nevertheless distinguishable
postwar environments.

421
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:11,687
One, where 20 million people are killed;
the other, 150 people killed.

422
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:14,726
You're talking about mass murder,
General, not war.

423
00:34:14,794 --> 00:34:18,389
Mr.President, I'm not saying
we wouldn't get our hair mussed.

424
00:34:18,464 --> 00:34:23,094
But I do say no more than
10 to 20 million killed. Tops!

425
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:25,160
Depending on the breaks.

426
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:29,230
I will not go down in history as
the greatest mass murderer since Hitler!

427
00:34:29,308 --> 00:34:31,902
It might be better
if you were more concerned...

428
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:35,311
with the American people than
with your image in the history books.

429
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:38,407
General Turgidson,
I've heard quite sufficient from you.

430
00:34:38,484 --> 00:34:40,884
Thank you very much.

431
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,513
Mr.President, they have
the ambassador waiting upstairs.

432
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:47,218
- Good. Any difficulty?
- He's having a fit about the M.P.s.

433
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,761
That can't be helped.
Have him brought here straightaway.

434
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:51,387
Yes, sir.

435
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,989
Is that the Russian ambassador?

436
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:56,159
Yes, it is, General.

437
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:01,239
Am I to understand
the Russian ambassador...

438
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,673
is to be admitted entrance
to the War Room?

439
00:35:03,743 --> 00:35:06,610
That is correct.
He is here on my orders.

440
00:35:09,515 --> 00:35:11,710
I don't know exactly how
to put this, sir...

441
00:35:11,784 --> 00:35:15,220
but are you aware of what a breach
of security that would be?

442
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:19,451
He'll see everything.
He'll see the big board.

443
00:35:20,393 --> 00:35:22,725
That is precisely the idea, General.

444
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:25,025
That is precisely the idea.

445
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:30,467
Staines, get Premier Kissoff
on the hot line.

446
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,512
"Survival kit contents check.

447
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,517
In them you will find
one .45 caliber automatic...

448
00:35:46,585 --> 00:35:49,076
two boxes of ammunition...

449
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:52,420
four days concentrated
emergency rations...

450
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:55,824
one drug issue
containing antibiotics...

451
00:35:55,895 --> 00:36:00,229
morphine, vitamin pills,
pep pills...

452
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:04,099
sleeping pills,
tranquilizer pills...

453
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:09,005
one miniature combination
Russian phrase book and Bible...

454
00:36:09,075 --> 00:36:12,101
$100 in rubles...

455
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:14,305
$100 in gold...

456
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,144
nine packs of chewing gum...

457
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,150
one issue of prophylactics...

458
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:23,245
three lipsticks,
three pair of nylon stockings."

459
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:28,055
Shoot, a fellow could have a pretty
good weekend in Vegas with that stuff.

460
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,433
- You don't have any fresh fish?
- I'm afraid not, sir.

461
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:38,697
- Your eggs are fresh?
- Yes, sir.

462
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:42,730
I will have poached eggs. And bring me
some cigars, please. Havana cigars.

463
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:46,209
That will be all, sir?
I'll see to it right away.

464
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:49,475
Try one of these Jamaican cigars,
Ambassador. They're good.

465
00:36:49,548 --> 00:36:53,006
Thank you, no. I do not support the work
of imperialist stooges.

466
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,679
Oh, only Commie stooges, huh?

467
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,313
Mr.President.

468
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:02,490
You're gonna let that lousy Commie punk
vomit all over us like this?

469
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:03,653
Mr.President?

470
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:07,495
They haven't reached Premier Kissoff.
They don't know where he is...

471
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:09,966
and he won't be back for two hours.

472
00:37:11,036 --> 00:37:13,527
Try B-8-6-5-4-3 Moscow.

473
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,699
You would never have found him
through his office.

474
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:19,802
Our premier is a man of the people,
but he is also a man, if you follow.

475
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:22,575
- Degenerate atheistic Commie.
- What did you say?

476
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:26,209
I said Premier Kissoff is
a degenerate atheistic Commie!

477
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,220
- Have this ignorant fool--
- I'm sorry!

478
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:33,224
Mr.President,
I think they're trying the number.

479
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:46,997
Gentlemen, you can't fight in here.
This is the War Room!

480
00:37:47,072 --> 00:37:49,905
What is going on here?
I demand an explanation.

481
00:37:49,975 --> 00:37:54,241
This clumsy fool tried to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

482
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,907
You bet your sweets, Mr.Commie!
Look at this, Mr.President.

483
00:37:56,982 --> 00:38:00,577
This lousy Commie rat was taking
pictures with this of the big board!

484
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,519
Mr.Ambassador!

485
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:07,855
This clumsy fool attempted to plant
that ridiculous camera on me.

486
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:10,794
That's a damn lie!
I saw him with my own eyes.

487
00:38:10,863 --> 00:38:15,061
This is outrageous. I have never heard
of such behavior in the War Room before.

488
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:17,625
Mr.President, I think
they're getting him on the line.

489
00:38:45,631 --> 00:38:47,565
You got to hand it to those Commies.

490
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:52,161
Yeah. Those trucks sure look like
the real thing, don't they?

491
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:54,172
I wonder where they got them from.

492
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,504
Probably bought them
from the army as war surplus.

493
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:04,273
Okay, open up at 200 yards.

494
00:40:01,507 --> 00:40:05,170
Tell him where you are and that
you'll speak if I say anything untrue...

495
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:07,542
but nothing more than that.

496
00:40:09,148 --> 00:40:12,549
Alexi? Alexi, please.
I beg you.

497
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,213
But I don't have a phone.

498
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:18,848
Give him the phone.

499
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:50,020
I've done as you asked.
Be careful. I think he is drunk.

500
00:40:53,025 --> 00:40:57,485
Hello? Hello, Dimitri?

501
00:40:57,563 --> 00:40:59,963
Listen, I can't hear too well.

502
00:41:00,032 --> 00:41:03,297
Could you turn the music down
a little?

503
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:05,303
That's much better.

504
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:07,999
Yeah. Yeah.

505
00:41:09,274 --> 00:41:12,072
Fine. I can hear you now, Dimitri.

506
00:41:12,144 --> 00:41:15,636
Clear and plain
and coming through fine.

507
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:20,117
I'm coming through fine, too, eh?
Good.

508
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:24,144
Well, then, as you say,
we're both coming through fine. Good.

509
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:26,157
It's good that you're fine...

510
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:28,489
and I'm fine.

511
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,791
I agree with you.
It's great to be fine.

512
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,893
Now, Dimitri...

513
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:40,667
you know how we've always talked
about the possibility...

514
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:43,435
of something going wrong
with the bomb.

515
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,778
The bomb, Dimitri.

516
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,608
The hydrogen bomb.

517
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:53,651
Well, now, what happened is...

518
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:57,951
one of our base commanders,
he had a sort of--

519
00:41:58,023 --> 00:42:01,254
Well, he went a little funny
in the head.

520
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:04,420
You know, just a little funny.

521
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:08,125
And he went and did a silly thing.

522
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:11,135
I'll tell you what he did.

523
00:42:11,203 --> 00:42:13,535
He ordered his planes...

524
00:42:15,207 --> 00:42:17,675
to attack your country.

525
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,143
Let me finish, Dimitri.

526
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:23,114
Let me finish, Dimitri.

527
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:26,379
Listen, how do you think
I feel about it?

528
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:29,319
Can you imagine how I feel
about it, Dimitri?

529
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:33,017
Why do you think I'm calling you?

530
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,117
Just to say hello?

531
00:42:36,195 --> 00:42:38,595
Of course I like to speak to you!

532
00:42:38,664 --> 00:42:41,189
Of course I like to say hello!

533
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:43,461
Not now, but anytime, Dimitri.

534
00:42:43,535 --> 00:42:47,562
I'm just calling up to tell you
something terrible has happened.

535
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:50,631
Of course, it's a friendly call.

536
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:54,975
Listen, if it wasn't friendly,
you probably wouldn't have even got it.

537
00:42:57,282 --> 00:43:02,049
They will not reach their targets
for at least another hour.

538
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:05,215
I am positive, Dimitri.

539
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,724
I've been all over this
with your ambassador.

540
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,284
It is not a trick.

541
00:43:10,362 --> 00:43:11,829
I'll tell you.

542
00:43:11,897 --> 00:43:15,731
We'd like to give your Air Staff
a complete rundown on the targets...

543
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:19,066
the flight plans
and defensive systems of the planes.

544
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:24,075
Yes, if we're unable
to recall the planes...

545
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,805
I'd say, well...

546
00:43:28,213 --> 00:43:32,582
we're just gonna have to help you
destroy them, Dimitri.

547
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:35,586
I know they're our boys.

548
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:38,179
Listen. Now, who should we call?

549
00:43:40,025 --> 00:43:44,519
Who should we call?
Sorry, you faded away.

550
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:49,599
The Peoples Central
Air Defense Headquarters.

551
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,966
Where is that, Dimitri?

552
00:43:52,037 --> 00:43:54,164
In Omsk. Right.

553
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,502
Yes.

554
00:43:56,575 --> 00:43:59,476
You'll call them first, will you?

555
00:44:00,979 --> 00:44:03,914
Do you happen to have the phone number
on you, Dimitri?

556
00:44:05,784 --> 00:44:08,776
What? I see.
Just ask for Omsk information.

557
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:14,986
I'm sorry too, Dimitri.
I'm very sorry.

558
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,894
All right, you're sorrier than I am.
But I am sorry as well.

559
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,464
I am as sorry as you are, Dimitri.

560
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,503
Don't say that you're more sorry
than I am...

561
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:28,506
because I'm capable of being
just as sorry as you are.

562
00:44:28,574 --> 00:44:30,508
So we're both sorry, all right?

563
00:44:30,576 --> 00:44:32,009
All right.

564
00:44:33,245 --> 00:44:37,511
Yes, he's right here. Yes, he wants
to talk to you. Just a second.

565
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,757
What?

566
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:13,316
What? What is it? What?

567
00:45:13,385 --> 00:45:16,411
The fools. The mad fools.

568
00:45:17,823 --> 00:45:19,984
What's happened?

569
00:45:20,058 --> 00:45:22,390
The doomsday machine.

570
00:45:22,461 --> 00:45:25,021
The doomsday machine?
What is that?

571
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:30,501
A device which will destroy
all human and animal life on Earth.

572
00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:32,833
All human and animal life?

573
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:49,984
- Mandrake?
- Yes, Jack?

574
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,885
Have you ever seen a Commie
drink a glass of water?

575
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,522
Well, I can't say I have, Jack.

576
00:46:00,732 --> 00:46:05,601
Vodka. That's what they drink,
isn't it? Never water.

577
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:10,074
I believe that's what they drink, yes.

578
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,600
On no account will a Commie
ever drink water...

579
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:16,011
and not without good reason.

580
00:46:17,082 --> 00:46:19,744
Oh, yes.

581
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:24,881
I can't quite see
what you're getting at.

582
00:46:26,024 --> 00:46:29,221
Water. That's what I'm getting at.
Water.

583
00:46:30,762 --> 00:46:34,220
Mandrake, water is the source
of all life.

584
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:39,362
Seven-tenths of this Earth's surface
is water.

585
00:46:39,438 --> 00:46:42,771
Why, do you realize that...

586
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,901
70% of you is water?

587
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:47,410
Good Lord.

588
00:46:47,479 --> 00:46:52,610
And as human beings,
you and I need fresh, pure water...

589
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:56,279
to replenish
our precious bodily fluids.

590
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,085
- You beginning to understand?
- Yes.

591
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:11,698
Have you never wondered why I drink
only distilled water...

592
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:16,173
or rainwater,
and only pure grain alcohol?

593
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:19,540
It did occur to me, Jack, yes.

594
00:47:20,645 --> 00:47:24,604
Have you ever heard of fluoridation
of water?

595
00:47:25,684 --> 00:47:29,518
Yes, I have heard of that, Jack, yes.

596
00:47:29,588 --> 00:47:31,522
Do you know what it is?

597
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,718
No, no, I don't know what it is.

598
00:47:34,793 --> 00:47:38,729
Do you realize that fluoridation...

599
00:47:38,797 --> 00:47:41,630
is the most monstrously conceived...

600
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,498
and dangerous Communist plot
we have ever had to face?

601
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,877
Two can play at that game, soldier.

602
00:47:57,983 --> 00:48:00,713
That's nice shooting, soldier!

603
00:48:25,177 --> 00:48:27,236
Mandrake, come here.

604
00:48:27,312 --> 00:48:29,337
You calling me, Jack?

605
00:48:29,414 --> 00:48:31,848
Come over here
and help me with this belt.

606
00:48:34,886 --> 00:48:37,878
I haven't had very much experience...

607
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,754
with those sort of machines.

608
00:48:40,826 --> 00:48:44,626
I've only ever pressed a button
in my old Spitfire.

609
00:48:44,696 --> 00:48:48,325
In the name of Her Majesty and the
Continental Congress, feed me this belt.

610
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,167
Jack, I'd love to come,
but what's happened, you see...

611
00:48:53,238 --> 00:48:56,036
the string in my leg is gone.

612
00:48:57,108 --> 00:49:00,908
- The what?
- The string. I never told you.

613
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,881
I've got a gammy leg.
Oh, dear. Gone. Shot off.

614
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:10,681
Mandrake, come over here.
The redcoats are coming.

615
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:15,954
When it is detonated, it will produce
enough radioactive fallout...

616
00:49:16,027 --> 00:49:17,961
so that in ten months...

617
00:49:18,029 --> 00:49:21,123
the surface of the Earth
will be as dead as the moon!

618
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,168
Come on, De Sadesky!
That's ridiculous!

619
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:28,366
Our studies show even the worst fallout
is down to a safe level after two weeks.

620
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,468
- You never heard of cobalt theoium G.
- What about it?

621
00:49:33,545 --> 00:49:37,641
Cobalt thorium G has
a radioactive half-life of 93 years.

622
00:49:37,716 --> 00:49:40,810
If you take 50 H bombs
in the 100 megaton range...

623
00:49:40,886 --> 00:49:43,286
and jacket them
with cobalt thorium G...

624
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:47,985
when they are exploded,
they will produce a doomsday shroud...

625
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:50,357
a lethal cloud of radioactivity...

626
00:49:50,428 --> 00:49:54,865
which will encircle the Earth
for 93 years!

627
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:58,494
What a load of Commie bull.
I mean, after all.

628
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:02,233
I'm afraid I don't understand
something, Alexi.

629
00:50:02,307 --> 00:50:05,936
Is the premier threatening to explode it
if our planes carry out their attack?

630
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:08,571
No, sir. It is not a thing
a sane man would do.

631
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:11,582
The doomsday machine is designed
to trigger itself automatically.

632
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:13,914
Surely you can disarm it somehow.

633
00:50:13,985 --> 00:50:17,921
It is designed to explode if
any attempt is made to un-trigger it.

634
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:19,251
Automatically?

635
00:50:19,324 --> 00:50:21,918
It's a Commie trick!
We're wasting valuable time!

636
00:50:21,993 --> 00:50:25,087
Look at the big board!
They're getting ready to clobber us!

637
00:50:25,163 --> 00:50:29,827
This is absolute madness.
Why should you build such a thing?

638
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,869
There are those of us
who fought against it.

639
00:50:31,937 --> 00:50:33,996
But in the end, we could not keep up
with the expense involved...

640
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:38,600
in the arms race, the space race
and the peace race.

641
00:50:38,677 --> 00:50:43,910
At the same time, our people grumbled
for more nylons and washing machines.

642
00:50:43,982 --> 00:50:46,542
Our doomsday scheme cost us
just a small fraction...

643
00:50:46,618 --> 00:50:49,849
of what we have been spending on defense
in a single year.

644
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:54,358
The deciding factor was when we learned
your country was working similarly...

645
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,360
and we were afraid of a doomsday gap!

646
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,795
This is preposterous! I've never
approved of anything like that.

647
00:50:59,864 --> 00:51:02,697
Our source was The New York Times.

648
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:06,669
Dr.Strangelove, do we have anything
like that in the works?

649
00:51:06,738 --> 00:51:09,206
A moment, please, Mr.President.

650
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:15,379
Under the authority granted me...

651
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,611
as director of weapons research
and development...

652
00:51:19,684 --> 00:51:23,882
I commissioned last year
a study of this project...

653
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,185
by the Bland Corporation.

654
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:29,420
Based on the findings of the report...

655
00:51:29,494 --> 00:51:34,989
my conclusion was that this idea
was not a practical deterrent...

656
00:51:35,066 --> 00:51:38,900
for reasons which at this moment
must be all too obvious.

657
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,371
You mean it is possible for them
to have built such a thing?

658
00:51:46,544 --> 00:51:51,413
Mr.President, the technology required
is easily within the means...

659
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:55,886
of even the smallest nuclear power.

660
00:51:55,954 --> 00:51:59,913
It requires only the will to do so.

661
00:52:00,925 --> 00:52:04,793
But how is it possible for this thing
to be triggered automatically...

662
00:52:04,863 --> 00:52:07,195
and at the same time
impossible to un-trigger?

663
00:52:07,265 --> 00:52:11,292
Mr.President,
it is not only possible...

664
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:13,303
it is essential.

665
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:17,808
That is the whole idea
of this machine, you know.

666
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:23,075
Deterrence is the art of producing
in the mind of the enemy...

667
00:52:23,148 --> 00:52:25,742
the fear of attack.

668
00:52:25,817 --> 00:52:30,754
And so because of the automated and
irrevocable decision-making process...

669
00:52:30,822 --> 00:52:34,724
which rules out human meddling...

670
00:52:34,793 --> 00:52:38,752
the doomsday machine is terrifying...

671
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,923
and simple to understand...

672
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:44,696
and completely credible
and convincing.

673
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:48,102
I wish we had one of them
doomsday machines.

674
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:51,768
But this is fantastic, Strangelove.
How can it be triggered automatically?

675
00:52:51,843 --> 00:52:55,643
It's remarkably simple to do that.

676
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:59,241
When you merely wish to bury bombs...

677
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:01,649
there's no limit to the size.

678
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,950
After that, they are connected...

679
00:53:04,022 --> 00:53:08,049
to a gigantic complex of computers.

680
00:53:08,126 --> 00:53:13,860
Now then, a specific and clearly
defined set of circumstances...

681
00:53:13,932 --> 00:53:17,390
under which the bombs
are to be exploded...

682
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:21,496
is programmed into a tape memory bank.

683
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:24,667
Hmm. Strangelove?

684
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,804
What kind of a name is that?
That ain't no Kraut name, is it?

685
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,178
He changed it when he became a citizen.

686
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:34,241
It used to be Merkwurdichliebe.

687
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,688
Well, a Kraut by any other name,
uh, Stainsey?

688
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:44,961
The whole point of
the doomsday machine...

689
00:53:45,029 --> 00:53:48,590
is lost if you keep it a secret!

690
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:50,827
Why didn't you tell the world?

691
00:53:50,902 --> 00:53:55,305
It was to be announced
at the Party Congress on Monday.

692
00:53:55,373 --> 00:53:58,706
As you know,
the premier loves surprises.

693
00:54:47,192 --> 00:54:49,422
Stay with me, Mandrake.

694
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:57,295
All right, now feed me.
Feed me, boy.

695
00:55:27,165 --> 00:55:32,228
Don't you think we'd be better off
away from this flying glass?

696
00:55:32,303 --> 00:55:34,362
We're okay here.

697
00:55:36,007 --> 00:55:40,034
Mandrake, do you realize that
in addition to fluoridating the water...

698
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:43,672
there are studies underway
to fluoridate salt, flour...

699
00:55:43,748 --> 00:55:48,776
fruit juices, soup, sugar,
milk, ice cream?

700
00:55:48,853 --> 00:55:50,115
Ice cream.

701
00:55:50,188 --> 00:55:52,622
- Children's ice cream.
- Good Lord.

702
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,124
You know when fluoridation
first began?

703
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,094
No, I don't, Jack.

704
00:55:58,162 --> 00:56:00,630
1946.

705
00:56:00,698 --> 00:56:03,462
1946, Mandrake.

706
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:07,834
How does that coincide with
your postwar Commie conspiracy, huh?

707
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,205
It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

708
00:56:11,276 --> 00:56:16,805
A foreign substance is introduced
into our precious bodily fluids...

709
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:20,146
without the knowledge
of the individual.

710
00:56:20,218 --> 00:56:22,152
Certainly without any choice.

711
00:56:23,955 --> 00:56:27,254
That's the way a hard-core Commie works.

712
00:56:28,693 --> 00:56:31,924
Jack. Tell me, Jack.

713
00:56:31,996 --> 00:56:34,658
When did you first become--

714
00:56:34,732 --> 00:56:37,496
Well, develop this theory?

715
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,833
Well, I--

716
00:56:40,905 --> 00:56:44,466
I first became aware of it, Mandrake...

717
00:56:44,542 --> 00:56:46,533
during the physical act of love.

718
00:56:48,313 --> 00:56:52,579
Yes, a profound sense of fatigue...

719
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:55,210
feeling of emptiness followed.

720
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:59,052
Luckily I was able to interpret
these feelings correctly.

721
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,085
Loss of essence.

722
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:07,459
I can assure you it has not recurred,
Mandrake.

723
00:57:07,532 --> 00:57:10,467
Women sense my power...

724
00:57:11,703 --> 00:57:13,830
and they seek the life essence.

725
00:57:15,106 --> 00:57:18,439
I do not avoid women, Mandrake.

726
00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:21,410
But I do deny them my essence.

727
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,346
Yes, yes, Jack.

728
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,122
Cease fire!

729
00:58:00,418 --> 00:58:02,113
My boys must have surrendered.

730
00:58:02,186 --> 00:58:04,518
There it is.

731
00:58:04,589 --> 00:58:06,420
Jack, listen.

732
00:58:06,491 --> 00:58:09,824
While there's still time, I beg you,
let's recall the Wing and--

733
00:58:11,963 --> 00:58:14,796
Those boys were like my children.

734
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,426
Now they let me down.

735
00:58:18,503 --> 00:58:20,198
No, not a bit.

736
00:58:20,271 --> 00:58:23,069
I'm sure they all gave it
their very best.

737
00:58:23,141 --> 00:58:25,632
I'm equally sure they all died
thinking of you...

738
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,440
every man jack of them, Jack.

739
00:58:28,513 --> 00:58:31,175
Supposing a bit of water
has gone off, eh?

740
00:58:31,249 --> 00:58:33,547
Certainly one can never be too sure
about those things.

741
00:58:33,618 --> 00:58:36,587
But look at me.
Do I look all rancid and clotted?

742
00:58:36,654 --> 00:58:39,452
Look at me, Jack. Look.

743
00:58:39,524 --> 00:58:43,620
And I drink a lot of water.
I'm what you might call a water man.

744
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:47,061
And I can swear to you, my boy,
swear to you...

745
00:58:47,131 --> 00:58:49,395
that there's nothing wrong
with my bodily fluids.

746
00:58:49,467 --> 00:58:51,958
Not a thing, Jackie.

747
00:58:52,036 --> 00:58:54,334
Mandrake, were you ever
a prisoner of war?

748
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:58,068
Well, Jack, the time's running very--

749
00:58:58,142 --> 00:59:01,202
- What?
- Were you ever a prisoner of war?

750
00:59:01,279 --> 00:59:03,372
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.

751
00:59:03,448 --> 00:59:06,542
Did they torture you?

752
00:59:06,617 --> 00:59:09,643
Yes, they did.
I was tortured by the Japanese.

753
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,381
Not a pretty story.

754
00:59:11,456 --> 00:59:13,048
What happened?

755
00:59:13,124 --> 00:59:17,424
I don't know, Jack. It's difficult
to think under these conditions.

756
00:59:17,495 --> 00:59:19,725
Well, what happened was...

757
00:59:19,797 --> 00:59:23,198
they got me on the old
Rangoon-Inchinawa Railway.

758
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:27,636
I was laying train lines
for the bloody Japanese puff-puffs.

759
00:59:27,705 --> 00:59:30,936
No, I mean, when they tortured you,
did you talk?

760
00:59:32,677 --> 00:59:34,668
No, I--

761
00:59:34,745 --> 00:59:39,011
Well, I don't think they wanted me
to talk, really, or say anything.

762
00:59:39,083 --> 00:59:42,177
It was their way of having
a bit of fun, the swine.

763
00:59:42,253 --> 00:59:45,586
The strange thing is,
they make such bloody good cameras.

764
00:59:47,325 --> 00:59:52,957
Those clowns outside will give me
a good going-over soon for the code.

765
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,334
Yes, you may have quite a point
there, Jack.

766
01:00:00,438 --> 01:00:03,430
I don't know how well
I could stand up under torture.

767
01:00:03,508 --> 01:00:06,773
The answer to that is,
no one ever does.

768
01:00:06,844 --> 01:00:10,974
And my advise to you
is to give me the code now.

769
01:00:11,048 --> 01:00:13,949
If those devils come back
and try any rough stuff...

770
01:00:14,018 --> 01:00:17,283
we'll fight them together
like we did just now on the floor.

771
01:00:17,355 --> 01:00:20,882
You with your gun and me
with a belt of ammo, feeding you.

772
01:00:20,958 --> 01:00:23,756
"Feed me," you said,
and I was feeding you, Jack.

773
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:26,490
You know, Mandrake...

774
01:00:26,564 --> 01:00:29,795
I happen to believe in
a life after this one...

775
01:00:31,302 --> 01:00:34,738
and I know I'll have to answer
for what I've done.

776
01:00:36,574 --> 01:00:38,041
And I think I can.

777
01:00:38,109 --> 01:00:41,340
Yes, of course you can.
Of course you can. You can.

778
01:00:41,412 --> 01:00:43,846
I'm a religious man myself,
you know.

779
01:00:43,915 --> 01:00:47,783
I believe in all that sort of thing
and I'm hoping, you know, Jack--

780
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:50,719
You've dropped your gun, Jack.

781
01:00:50,788 --> 01:00:54,383
No, Jack, let me take that for you.

782
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:57,950
You know what I'm hoping? I'm hoping
you're going to give me the code, boy.

783
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:02,358
You're going to wash and brush up?
What a good idea.

784
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:05,027
Always did wonders for a man,
a wash and brush up.

785
01:01:05,102 --> 01:01:07,866
Water on the back of the neck
makes you feel marvelous.

786
01:01:07,939 --> 01:01:10,703
That's what we need: water on
the back of the neck and the code.

787
01:01:10,775 --> 01:01:14,370
Supposing I play a little guessing game
with you, Jack boy?

788
01:01:14,445 --> 01:01:17,437
I'll try and guess
what the code is--

789
01:01:33,931 --> 01:01:38,425
Copilot to navigator.
I'm ready with the fuel figures now.

790
01:01:38,502 --> 01:01:41,471
We have 109,000 total...

791
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:44,372
79,000 in the mains...

792
01:01:44,442 --> 01:01:47,240
and 30,000 in the auxiliaries.

793
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:49,245
And that works out
to roughly...

794
01:01:49,313 --> 01:01:52,771
seven hours, 15 minutes
endurance from this time.

795
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,351
D.S.O. to Captain.

796
01:01:55,419 --> 01:01:58,513
I have an unidentified
radar blip.

797
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:02,518
Distance: 60 miles.

798
01:02:03,694 --> 01:02:06,857
Approximate speed:
Mach three.

799
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,865
Looks like
a missile tracking us.

800
01:02:11,802 --> 01:02:13,861
Confirmed:
definite missile track.

801
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,997
Commence evasive action right.

802
01:02:22,246 --> 01:02:25,909
Missile still closing range.

803
01:02:25,983 --> 01:02:29,976
Distance: 50 miles.
Continue evasive action.

804
01:02:30,054 --> 01:02:32,784
Lock E.C.M. to target intercept mode.

805
01:02:32,857 --> 01:02:36,486
E.C.M. locked to
target intercept mode.

806
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:38,994
Missile still tracking
and closing distance.

807
01:02:39,063 --> 01:02:43,056
Range: 40 miles.
Continue evasive action.

808
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:50,236
Electronic Guidance Scrambler
to blue grid.

809
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,800
Missile still tracking steady
and closing distance.

810
01:02:53,878 --> 01:02:55,812
Range: 30 miles.

811
01:02:58,082 --> 01:03:02,314
Missile still closing true and steady.
Continue evasive action.

812
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,851
Range: 20 miles.

813
01:03:11,929 --> 01:03:15,797
Missile still closing distance
and tracking steady.

814
01:03:15,866 --> 01:03:18,300
Attack range gate
on maximum scan.

815
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:20,803
Range gate on maximum scan.

816
01:03:20,871 --> 01:03:23,738
Range: 10 miles.

817
01:03:23,808 --> 01:03:27,767
Missile track deflecting.
Continue evasive action.

818
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:31,110
Deflection increasing.
Range: eight miles.

819
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:35,118
Deflection still increasing.
Range: six miles.

820
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,882
Missile still deflecting.
Range: four miles.

821
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:46,891
Range: two miles.
Missile still deflecting.

822
01:03:46,964 --> 01:03:49,228
Range: one mile.
Missile detonated!

823
01:03:55,906 --> 01:03:57,999
- Start lever to cut off!
- Cut off!

824
01:04:01,412 --> 01:04:02,845
We're losin' power!

825
01:04:11,288 --> 01:04:13,620
Re-select essential power!

826
01:04:13,691 --> 01:04:15,716
Essential power re-selected.

827
01:04:22,333 --> 01:04:24,267
The hatch is stuck!

828
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:29,271
Hit emergency power!

829
01:04:31,776 --> 01:04:34,609
- Extinguishers!
- Roger!

830
01:04:41,352 --> 01:04:44,617
- Transfer switches!
- Transferred!

831
01:04:44,688 --> 01:04:46,952
- Boost pumps off!
- Cut off!

832
01:04:58,702 --> 01:05:00,693
Fuel valves three, four and six!

833
01:05:13,217 --> 01:05:14,650
Give me full power!

834
01:05:27,531 --> 01:05:30,125
Peace on Earth.

835
01:05:34,772 --> 01:05:37,468
P.O.E.

836
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:40,408
Purity of Essence.

837
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:44,005
O.P.O.E.

838
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,491
Put your hands over your head.

839
01:05:57,561 --> 01:06:00,189
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?

840
01:06:00,264 --> 01:06:02,129
Put your hands over your head.

841
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:05,794
What kind of suit
do you call that, fella?

842
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:07,861
What do you mean, suit?

843
01:06:07,938 --> 01:06:10,372
This happens to be
an R.A.F. uniform...

844
01:06:10,441 --> 01:06:14,775
and I am Group Captain Lionel Mandrake,
General Ripper's executive officer.

845
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:16,369
Where's General Ripper?

846
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:19,280
He's dead, in the bathroom.

847
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,511
Where's the bathroom?

848
01:06:21,585 --> 01:06:23,018
Next to you.

849
01:06:32,496 --> 01:06:35,226
I don't know what stupid game
this is you're playing...

850
01:06:35,299 --> 01:06:37,426
but I've got a good idea
what the recall code is...

851
01:06:37,501 --> 01:06:40,026
and I have to get in touch
with SAC headquarters immediately!

852
01:06:40,104 --> 01:06:43,801
Put your hands over your head
and keep 'em there! Go on.

853
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:45,569
Got any witnesses?

854
01:06:45,643 --> 01:06:47,577
What are you talking about?
He shot himself!

855
01:06:47,645 --> 01:06:49,670
While he was shavin'?

856
01:06:49,747 --> 01:06:52,910
Now look, Colonel Bat Guano...

857
01:06:52,983 --> 01:06:55,451
if that really is your name...

858
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:59,387
may I tell you that I have
a very good idea--

859
01:06:59,456 --> 01:07:02,482
I think, hope, pray--
what the recall code is.

860
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,290
It's some theme he kept repeating.
A variation on...

861
01:07:05,362 --> 01:07:08,593
"Peace on Earth" or "Purity of Essence,"
one of those.

862
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:12,500
Put your hands on top of your head.
Start walkin'.

863
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,801
Don't you know that General Ripper
went mad...

864
01:07:15,873 --> 01:07:19,274
and sent the whole Wing
to attack the Soviets?

865
01:07:19,343 --> 01:07:22,870
- What are you talkin' about?
- I'll tell you what I'm talking about.

866
01:07:22,947 --> 01:07:27,043
I'm going to pick up this red telephone,
which is connected to SAC...

867
01:07:27,117 --> 01:07:28,550
and I hope--

868
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:32,248
Blast. Blast.

869
01:07:32,323 --> 01:07:36,316
Shot away, I expect, by one of your men
during this ridiculous fighting!

870
01:07:37,761 --> 01:07:39,786
Right.

871
01:07:39,863 --> 01:07:43,264
All right, Charlie, I've been
wastin' too much time on you.

872
01:07:43,334 --> 01:07:47,134
I got a lot of wounded men outside.
Start walkin'.

873
01:08:09,426 --> 01:08:13,260
All the radio gear is out,
including the C.R.M. 114.

874
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:16,493
I think the auto-destruct mechanism
got hit and blew itself up.

875
01:08:21,005 --> 01:08:24,236
The fire is out.
The emergency power is on.

876
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:27,800
Everything checks out all right.
Will advise.

877
01:08:27,878 --> 01:08:29,607
Roger. Navigator?

878
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:35,141
I've worked out our rate of fuel loss
at approximately 1-6-2 per minute.

879
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:38,017
This gives us a radius of action
sufficient to take out...

880
01:08:38,088 --> 01:08:41,455
primary and secondary targets,
but we will not...

881
01:08:41,525 --> 01:08:45,689
repeat, not be able to make it back
to any base or neutral country.

882
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:49,190
However, we would have
enough fuel to ditch...

883
01:08:49,266 --> 01:08:51,996
at weather ship Tango Delta...

884
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:55,334
grid coordinates 0-0-3-6-9-1.

885
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,544
Well, boys,
we got three engines out.

886
01:09:02,613 --> 01:09:06,413
We got more holes in us
than a horse trader's mule.

887
01:09:06,483 --> 01:09:08,508
The radio is gone,
and we're leakin' fuel.

888
01:09:08,585 --> 01:09:12,021
And if we was flyin' any lower,
we'd need sleigh bells on this thing.

889
01:09:12,089 --> 01:09:15,081
But we got one little budge
on them Ruskies.

890
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:17,093
At this height
they might harpoon us...

891
01:09:17,161 --> 01:09:20,255
but they sure ain't gonna spot us
on no radar screen.

892
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:33,376
The other way.

893
01:09:33,444 --> 01:09:35,844
- Where are you taking me?
- To the main gate.

894
01:09:37,915 --> 01:09:41,373
Colonel, I must know what you think
has been going on here.

895
01:09:41,452 --> 01:09:43,386
- You wanna know what I think?
- Yes.

896
01:09:43,454 --> 01:09:46,150
I think you're some kind
of deviated "prevert."

897
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,953
I think General Ripper found out
about your "preversion"...

898
01:09:49,026 --> 01:09:51,324
and that you were organizing
some kind of mutiny of "preverts."

899
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:53,795
Now, move!

900
01:09:53,864 --> 01:09:57,197
On top of that, I don't know anything
about any planes attacking Russia.

901
01:09:57,267 --> 01:10:01,067
I was told to get Ripper on the phone
with the President of the United States.

902
01:10:01,138 --> 01:10:05,905
Now just one second.
You just said "the president."

903
01:10:05,976 --> 01:10:08,206
What about the president?

904
01:10:08,278 --> 01:10:11,441
The president wants to speak
to General Ripper, doesn't he?

905
01:10:11,515 --> 01:10:14,109
Now, General Ripper is dead,
is he not?

906
01:10:14,184 --> 01:10:16,414
I am General Ripper's
executive officer...

907
01:10:16,487 --> 01:10:19,456
so the president will want
to speak to me, won't he?

908
01:10:19,523 --> 01:10:23,254
There's a telephone box over there
and the line may be open.

909
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:26,125
You wanna talk to
the President of the United States?

910
01:10:26,196 --> 01:10:29,063
I don't want to talk to him, Colonel,
I've got to talk to him.

911
01:10:29,133 --> 01:10:32,796
And if you don't put that gun away
and stop this stupid nonsense...

912
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:36,897
the Court of Inquiry on this
will give you such a pranging...

913
01:10:36,974 --> 01:10:41,070
you'll be lucky to end up wearing the
uniform of a bloody toilet attendant!

914
01:10:45,883 --> 01:10:49,512
Go ahead, try and get the President
of the United States on the phone.

915
01:10:52,189 --> 01:10:54,248
Try any "preversions,"
I'll blow your head off.

916
01:11:08,872 --> 01:11:11,705
Operator? This is
Group Captain Lionel Mandrake.

917
01:11:11,775 --> 01:11:13,834
I'm speaking from
Burpelson Air Force Base.

918
01:11:13,911 --> 01:11:17,813
Something urgent has come up and I want
you to place a person-to-person call...

919
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:20,975
with President Merkin Muffley
in the Pentagon, Washington, D.C.

920
01:11:22,352 --> 01:11:25,549
Burpelson 3-9-1-8-0.

921
01:11:26,757 --> 01:11:31,820
No, I'm perfectly serious.
The President of the United States.

922
01:11:31,895 --> 01:11:34,796
I'm sorry,
I haven't got enough change.

923
01:11:34,865 --> 01:11:38,301
Could you make this
a collect call, Operator?

924
01:11:50,247 --> 01:11:53,876
Just one second, Operator.
They won't accept the call.

925
01:11:53,951 --> 01:11:55,851
Have you got 55 cents?

926
01:11:55,919 --> 01:11:58,945
Do you think I'd go into combat
with loose change in my pocket?

927
01:12:01,325 --> 01:12:04,226
Operator, look.

928
01:12:04,294 --> 01:12:07,786
Is it possible to make this
an ordinary trunk call?

929
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:10,629
Well, what do you call it?
You know--

930
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:13,693
Oh, station-to-station.

931
01:12:17,808 --> 01:12:21,300
Oh, blast!
I'm still 20 cents short.

932
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:26,616
Operator, hold on.
I shan't keep you a second.

933
01:12:26,683 --> 01:12:30,847
Colonel, that Coca-Cola machine.
I want you to shoot the lock off it.

934
01:12:30,921 --> 01:12:32,980
There may be change in there.

935
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:37,993
That's private property.

936
01:12:38,061 --> 01:12:40,996
Can you possibly imagine
what is going to happen to you...

937
01:12:41,064 --> 01:12:43,760
your frame outlook,
way of life and everything...

938
01:12:43,834 --> 01:12:48,362
when they learn you have obstructed
a phone call to the president?

939
01:12:48,438 --> 01:12:52,431
Can you imagine?
Shoot it off!

940
01:12:52,509 --> 01:12:56,138
Shoot with the gun! That's what
the bullets are for, you twit!

941
01:12:56,213 --> 01:12:59,671
Okay, I'm gonna get
your money for you.

942
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,880
But if you don't get the president on
the phone, you know what's gonna happen?

943
01:13:03,954 --> 01:13:07,549
You're gonna have to answer
to the Coca-Cola Company.

944
01:13:16,867 --> 01:13:19,802
This is SAC
Communications Control.

945
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:23,271
The recall code O.P.E...

946
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,274
is being acknowledged "roger"...

947
01:13:25,342 --> 01:13:30,245
by elements of
the 8-4-3 Bomb Wing.

948
01:13:30,314 --> 01:13:32,305
These are the details.

949
01:13:32,382 --> 01:13:36,944
Missions 12, 22, 30 and 38...

950
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:40,581
are reported destroyed
by enemy action.

951
01:13:40,657 --> 01:13:45,253
All other missions have
acknowledged recall code.

952
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:47,263
This is SAC Communications Control.

953
01:13:47,331 --> 01:13:48,992
Over and out.

954
01:13:49,066 --> 01:13:50,966
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

955
01:13:51,034 --> 01:13:53,434
Gentlemen.

956
01:13:53,503 --> 01:13:55,437
Mr.President.

957
01:13:55,505 --> 01:13:57,598
I'm not a sentimentalist by nature...

958
01:13:57,674 --> 01:14:00,939
but I think I know what's
in every heart in this room.

959
01:14:01,011 --> 01:14:04,845
I think we all ought
to bow our heads...

960
01:14:04,915 --> 01:14:06,974
and give a prayer of thanks
for our deliverance.

961
01:14:07,050 --> 01:14:08,483
Lord...

962
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:14,316
we have heard the wings
of the Angel of Death...

963
01:14:14,391 --> 01:14:17,258
fluttering over our heads
from the Valley of Fear.

964
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:19,989
You have seen fit to deliver us
from the forces of evil--

965
01:14:20,063 --> 01:14:21,655
Excuse me, sir.

966
01:14:21,732 --> 01:14:24,860
Premier Kissoff's calling again
and he's hopping mad.

967
01:14:31,608 --> 01:14:35,544
Fuel flow on active engines
and leakage has increased.

968
01:14:35,612 --> 01:14:39,639
Now works out at 2-0-5.

969
01:14:40,717 --> 01:14:42,708
Estimate remaining fuel...

970
01:14:42,786 --> 01:14:46,688
at 8-7-9-0.

971
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:53,895
Roger.
Confirm 2-0-5 per minute...

972
01:14:53,964 --> 01:14:58,025
and remaining fuel 8-7-9-0.

973
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:08,637
No, no, Dimitri,
there must be some mistake.

974
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:10,771
No, I'm certain of that.

975
01:15:10,847 --> 01:15:15,045
I'm perfectly certain
of that, Dimitri.

976
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:18,019
Just a second.
You know what he says?

977
01:15:18,088 --> 01:15:20,352
He says one of the planes
hasn't turned back.

978
01:15:20,424 --> 01:15:23,018
He says according to information
forwarded by our Air Staffs...

979
01:15:23,093 --> 01:15:26,028
it's headed for
the missile complex at Laputa.

980
01:15:29,032 --> 01:15:31,967
That's impossible, Mr.President.

981
01:15:32,035 --> 01:15:34,094
I mean,
look at the big board.

982
01:15:34,171 --> 01:15:37,299
Thirty-four planes, 30 recalls
acknowledged and four splashes...

983
01:15:37,374 --> 01:15:40,241
and one of them
was targeted for Laputa.

984
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,377
Dimitri, look, we've got
an acknowledgement from every plane...

985
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:49,715
except the four you've shot down.

986
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,460
Hang on a second, Dimitri.

987
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:02,862
He says their air defense now only
claims three aircraft confirmed.

988
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:05,401
The fourth may only be damaged.

989
01:16:07,571 --> 01:16:09,505
Mr.President...

990
01:16:09,573 --> 01:16:11,939
I'm beginnin' to smell
a big, fat Commie rat.

991
01:16:12,008 --> 01:16:15,876
I mean, supposin' Kissoff is lyin'
about that fourth plane...

992
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:18,107
just lookin' for
an excuse to clobber us?

993
01:16:18,181 --> 01:16:20,615
If the spaghetti hits the fan,
we're in trouble.

994
01:16:24,721 --> 01:16:27,315
Dimitri, look,
if this report is true...

995
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:31,019
and the plane manages
to bomb the target...

996
01:16:31,094 --> 01:16:35,326
is this gonna set off
the doomsday machine?

997
01:16:38,568 --> 01:16:40,536
Are you sure?

998
01:16:41,738 --> 01:16:46,300
Well, I guess you're just gonna have
to get that plane, Dimitri.

999
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:49,436
I'm sorry they're jamming
your radar and flying so low...

1000
01:16:49,513 --> 01:16:51,708
but they're trained to do it.

1001
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:53,442
It's initiative.

1002
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:58,019
Look, Dimitri, you know
exactly where they're going...

1003
01:16:58,088 --> 01:17:01,251
and I'm sure your entire air defense
can stop a single plane.

1004
01:17:04,427 --> 01:17:09,023
It's not gonna help either one of us
if the doomsday machine goes off, is it?

1005
01:17:10,567 --> 01:17:15,834
There's no point in you getting
hysterical at a moment like this!

1006
01:17:15,906 --> 01:17:20,138
Keep your feet on the ground
when you're talking, Dimitri.

1007
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:22,474
I am not--
I am not getting--

1008
01:17:22,546 --> 01:17:24,980
No, Dimitri, I'm just worried.

1009
01:17:25,048 --> 01:17:26,948
That's all.

1010
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:30,077
Now look, if our Air Staffs say
its primary target is Laputa...

1011
01:17:30,153 --> 01:17:34,112
and its secondary target is Borchov,
it's true.

1012
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,624
You gotta believe it!

1013
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:39,423
Dimitri, can I give you
just one word--

1014
01:17:39,496 --> 01:17:42,829
Can I give you just one word
of advice, Dimitri?

1015
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:44,560
Listen, Dimitri.

1016
01:17:44,634 --> 01:17:48,195
Put everything you've got into
those two sectors, and you can't miss!

1017
01:17:54,578 --> 01:17:58,241
Sir, if we continue to lose fuel
at the present rate...

1018
01:17:58,315 --> 01:18:02,445
I estimate we only have
38 minutes flying time...

1019
01:18:02,519 --> 01:18:04,987
which will not even take us
as far as the primary.

1020
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:08,991
Doggone it, Sweets, you told me that
you could get me to the primary!

1021
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:12,893
I'm sorry, sir. That estimate was based
on the original loss rate factor...

1022
01:18:12,963 --> 01:18:14,760
not at 2-0-5.

1023
01:18:14,831 --> 01:18:17,095
I don't give a hoot in hell
how you do it...

1024
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:19,328
you just get me to
the primary, you hear?

1025
01:18:19,402 --> 01:18:22,838
I'm sorry, sir,
but those are the figures.

1026
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:26,171
We'll be lucky to reach
weather ship at Tango Delta.

1027
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,438
Well, shoot!

1028
01:18:28,511 --> 01:18:32,845
We ain't come this far just
to dump this thing in the drink.

1029
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:34,907
What's the nearest
target of opportunity?

1030
01:18:43,693 --> 01:18:46,423
Sir, if the rate of loss
does not increase...

1031
01:18:46,496 --> 01:18:50,262
we have a chance
to reach target 3-8-4...

1032
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:55,168
grid coordinate 0-0-3-6-9-1...

1033
01:18:55,238 --> 01:18:59,106
and possibly make it from there
to the Tango Delta weather ship.

1034
01:18:59,175 --> 01:19:01,302
What kind of a target
is that, anyhow?

1035
01:19:01,378 --> 01:19:05,314
Sir, that's the I.C.B.M.
complex at Kotloss.

1036
01:19:05,382 --> 01:19:11,116
All right.
Designating new target: 3-8-4.

1037
01:19:11,187 --> 01:19:14,179
Give me a headin' on that just as soon
as you get it worked out.

1038
01:19:26,369 --> 01:19:31,238
We'll keep our fingers crossed.
Remember, we're all in this together.

1039
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:35,142
We're right behind you,
we're with you all the way.

1040
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:38,942
Yes. We'll keep the line open.

1041
01:19:39,015 --> 01:19:40,448
All right, Dimitri.

1042
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:44,252
General Turgidson...

1043
01:19:44,321 --> 01:19:47,552
is there really a chance
for that plane to get through?

1044
01:19:49,259 --> 01:19:51,693
Mr.President,
if I may speak freely.

1045
01:19:51,761 --> 01:19:55,390
The Ruskie talks big, but frankly
we think he's short of know-how.

1046
01:19:55,465 --> 01:19:59,959
You can't expect ignorant peons
to understand a machine like our boys.

1047
01:20:00,036 --> 01:20:02,470
That's not meant as an insult,
Mr.Ambassador.

1048
01:20:02,539 --> 01:20:05,133
We all know how much guts
the average Ruskie's got.

1049
01:20:05,208 --> 01:20:08,336
Look at all of them Nazis killed
off, and they still wouldn't quit!

1050
01:20:08,411 --> 01:20:10,311
Can't you stick to the point?

1051
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:14,111
Well, sir,
if the pilot's good, see--

1052
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:18,348
I mean, if he's really sharp,
he can barrel that baby in so low.

1053
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:22,915
You oughta see it! It's a sight!
A big plane like a 52! Vroom!

1054
01:20:22,992 --> 01:20:26,052
Its jet exhaust fryin' chickens
in the barnyard!

1055
01:20:26,129 --> 01:20:29,257
- But has he got a chance?
- Has he got a chance?

1056
01:20:29,332 --> 01:20:30,765
Hell, ye--

1057
01:20:56,259 --> 01:20:57,692
Navigator to Captain.

1058
01:20:57,761 --> 01:21:02,289
Approaching target
at distance 1-0 miles.

1059
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:05,698
Switch from green grid
to target orange.

1060
01:21:05,769 --> 01:21:08,863
Roger.
Ready for final bomb run check.

1061
01:21:08,938 --> 01:21:10,371
- Take over, Ace.
- Roger.

1062
01:21:15,645 --> 01:21:18,136
- D.S.O. ready.
- Bombardier ready, sir.

1063
01:21:18,214 --> 01:21:20,409
Bomb fusing, master safety on.

1064
01:21:20,483 --> 01:21:23,577
Electronic, barometric,
time and impact.

1065
01:21:23,653 --> 01:21:25,985
Bomb fusing,
master safeties on.

1066
01:21:26,055 --> 01:21:29,115
Electronic, barometric,
time and impact.

1067
01:21:29,192 --> 01:21:32,787
Fuse for ground burst.

01:22:11,201 --> 01:22:13,135

1083
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,513
Second safety.

1084
01:22:33,056 --> 01:22:35,718

1085
01:22:46,302 --> 01:22:49,760

01:23:01,084 --> 01:23:03,416

1098
01:23:55,772 --> 01:23:59,708
Stay on the bomb run, Ace. I'm goin'
down below and see what I can do.

1099
01:24:12,655 --> 01:24:14,122
Stay on the bomb run.

1100
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:18,388
I'm gonna get them doors open
if it harelips everybody on Bear Creek!

1101
01:25:11,948 --> 01:25:14,849
Target orange grid reference checks.

1102
01:25:14,917 --> 01:25:17,215

1116
01:26:16,746 --> 01:26:19,271

1117
01:26:19,348 --> 01:26:21,043
Roger. Four miles.

1118

1119
01:26:24,087 --> 01:26:26,681

1120
01:26:36,933 --> 01:26:39,458
Target distance: three miles.

1121
01:26:39,535 --> 01:26:42,026
Roger. Three miles.

1122
01:26:42,105 --> 01:26:45,768
Target in sight!
Where in hell is Major Kong?

1123
01:27:09,532 --> 01:27:10,794
What about Major Kong?

1124
01:27:38,995 --> 01:27:42,692
Mr.President, I would not
rule out the chance...

1125
01:27:42,765 --> 01:27:45,825
to preserve a nucleus
of human specimens.

1126
01:27:45,902 --> 01:27:48,803
It would be quite easy...

1127
01:27:51,207 --> 01:27:56,304
at the bottom of some
of our deeper mine shafts.

1128
01:27:56,379 --> 01:28:01,214
The radioactivity would never penetrate
a mine some thousands of feet deep.

1129
01:28:01,284 --> 01:28:05,550
And in a matter of weeks, sufficient
improvements in dwelling space...

1130
01:28:05,621 --> 01:28:07,555
could easily be provided.

1131
01:28:07,623 --> 01:28:10,387
How long would you have
to stay down there?

1132
01:28:10,459 --> 01:28:14,327
Well, that's, you know--

1133
01:28:14,397 --> 01:28:17,059
Cobalt thorium G.

1134
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:31,144
Radioactive half-life of--

1135
01:28:33,216 --> 01:28:37,949
I would think that possibly
one hundred years.

1136
01:28:40,289 --> 01:28:44,282
You mean, people could actually
stay down there for 100 years?

1137
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,590
It would not be difficult,
Mein Fuhrer.

1138
01:28:46,662 --> 01:28:48,892
Nuclear reactors could--

1139
01:28:48,965 --> 01:28:51,331
I'm sorry, Mr.President.

1140
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:55,200
Nuclear reactors could provide
power almost indefinitely.

1141
01:28:55,271 --> 01:28:58,104
Greenhouses could maintain
plant life.

1142
01:28:58,174 --> 01:29:01,769
Animals could be bred
and slaughtered.

1143
01:29:01,844 --> 01:29:06,281
A quick survey would have to be made of
the available mine sites in the country.

1144
01:29:06,349 --> 01:29:10,149
But I would guess
that a dwelling space...

1145
01:29:10,219 --> 01:29:13,882
for several hundred thousand of
our people could easily be provided.

1146
01:29:13,956 --> 01:29:17,084
Well, I would hate
to have to decide...

1147
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:20,060
who stays up and who goes down.

1148
01:29:20,129 --> 01:29:24,031
Well, that would not be
necessary, Mr.President.

1149
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:26,967
It could easily be accomplished
with a computer.

1150
01:29:27,036 --> 01:29:29,334
And the computer could
be set and programmed...

1151
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:32,465
to accept factors
from youth, health...

1152
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:35,704
sexual fertility, intelligence...

1153
01:29:35,778 --> 01:29:38,269
and a cross-section
of necessary skills.

1154
01:29:38,347 --> 01:29:40,611
Of course, it would be
absolutely vital...

1155
01:29:40,683 --> 01:29:44,642
that our top government
and military men be included...

1156
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:49,555
to foster and impart the required
principles of leadership and tradition.

1157
01:29:55,598 --> 01:29:58,533
Naturally, they would breed
prodigiously.

1158
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:01,399
There would be much time
and little to do.

1159
01:30:03,005 --> 01:30:07,942
But with the proper breeding techniques
and a ratio of, say...

1160
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:10,774
ten females to each male...

1161
01:30:10,846 --> 01:30:15,476
they could then work their way back
to the present gross national product...

1162
01:30:15,551 --> 01:30:17,314
within 20 years.

1163
01:30:18,521 --> 01:30:21,251
But look, Doctor.
Wouldn't this nucleus of survivors...

1164
01:30:21,324 --> 01:30:26,421
be so grief-stricken
and anguished that they...

1165
01:30:26,495 --> 01:30:29,987
well, envy the dead
and not want to go on living?

1166
01:30:30,066 --> 01:30:32,899
No, sir. Excuse me.

1167
01:30:42,178 --> 01:30:46,114
When they go down into the mine,
everyone would still be alive.

1168
01:30:46,182 --> 01:30:48,275
There would be
no shocking memories...

1169
01:30:48,351 --> 01:30:53,015
and the prevailing emotion will be one
of nostalgia for those left behind...

1170
01:30:53,089 --> 01:30:55,956
combined with a spirt of...

1171
01:30:56,025 --> 01:30:58,459
bold curiosity for
the adventure ahead!

1172
01:31:15,978 --> 01:31:17,912
Doctor...

1173
01:31:20,116 --> 01:31:25,554
you mentioned the ratio
of ten women to each man.

1174
01:31:25,621 --> 01:31:28,749
Now, wouldn't that
necessitate the abandonment...

1175
01:31:28,824 --> 01:31:32,624
of the so-called
monogamous sexual relationship?

1176
01:31:32,695 --> 01:31:36,324
I mean, as far as men were concerned?

1177
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:37,764
Regrettably, yes.

1178
01:31:37,833 --> 01:31:43,203
But it is a sacrifice required
for the future of the human race.

1179
01:31:43,272 --> 01:31:48,266
I hasten to add that since each man
will be required to do prodigious...

1180
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:51,980
service along these lines...

1181
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:55,848
the women will have to be selected
for their sexual characteristics...

1182
01:31:55,918 --> 01:31:59,684
which will have to be of
a highly stimulating nature.

1183
01:31:59,755 --> 01:32:03,589
I must confess, you have an
astonishingly good idea there, Doctor.

1184
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,193
Thank you, sir.

1185
01:32:06,262 --> 01:32:09,231
We ought to look at this
from the military point of view.

1186
01:32:09,298 --> 01:32:13,234
I mean,
supposing the Ruskies...

1187
01:32:13,302 --> 01:32:16,237
stashed away some big bombs,
see, and we didn't?

1188
01:32:16,305 --> 01:32:19,206
When they come out in 100 years,
they could take over!

1189
01:32:19,275 --> 01:32:21,038
I agree, Mr.President.

1190
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:24,705
They might try a sneak attack so they
could take over our mine shaft space.

1191
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:29,410
It'd be extremely naive of us to
imagine that these new developments...

1192
01:32:29,485 --> 01:32:32,420
are gonna cause any change
in Soviet expansionist policy!

1193
01:32:32,488 --> 01:32:35,321
I mean, we must be
increasingly on the alert...

1194
01:32:35,391 --> 01:32:37,916
to prevent them from taking over
other mine shaft space...

1195
01:32:37,993 --> 01:32:39,927
in order to breed more
prodigiously than we do...

1196
01:32:39,995 --> 01:32:43,123
thus knocking us out through
superior numbers when we emerge!

1197
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:47,295
Mr.President, we must not allow
a mine-shaft gap!

1198
01:32:47,369 --> 01:32:49,462
Sir!

1199
01:32:49,538 --> 01:32:51,802
I have a plan--

1200
01:32:53,342 --> 01:32:55,674
Mein Fuhrer...

1201
01:32:55,744 --> 01:32:58,338
I can walk!
