1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,472
Oh, Shelley.

2
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:07,970
I told you,

3
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:09,812
if you saw bugs on her
they're just termites.

4
00:00:09,857 --> 00:00:11,910
You didn't need to put
her in the flea pit.

5
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:13,280
Oh, no. That's
not the flea pit.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,480
The flea pit's over there.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,702
Hope's in time-out.

8
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:18,995
She's doing a 30-minute stretch

9
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:20,155
for hitting Jeremy.

10
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:23,418
Hitting?

11
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:25,374
That's not like her.

12
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,007
- Why's the dog in time-out?
- Rape.

13
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:29,830
Oh, I know they shouldn't be
sharing a cell,

14
00:00:29,889 --> 00:00:31,997
but I ran out of plastic fence.

15
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:33,521
And it's not like
he raped a kid.

16
00:00:33,596 --> 00:00:34,850
He raped a lamp.

17
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,099
He busted its bulb.

18
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:38,382
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about Hope.

19
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:39,669
She must have learned
how to fight

20
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:41,003
during her first six months
in the slammer,

21
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:43,532
'cause y should have seen her
kick Jeremy's ass.

22
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:45,771
Next time, you'll think twice
before you snatch a tinker toy

23
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,954
from my girl, won't you?

24
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:48,611
(growls)

25
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,060
We don't care for Jeremy;
he's a bit difficult.

26
00:00:51,144 --> 00:00:53,025
Jeremy's a fart face.

27
00:00:57,453 --> 00:00:59,539
 Whoo!

28
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,660
 Here we go, oh, oh, oh

29
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:05,801
 Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh

30
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,694
 Birth control, no, no, no

31
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:11,586
 Let it roll, oh, oh, oh

32
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:15,871
 Oh, oh...

33
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:17,879
 Whoo!

34
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,686
 Here we go, oh, oh, oh

35
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:23,034
 Oh, oh, oh!

Eat your dinner

39
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:30,101
Popsicles and olives?

40
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:31,728
Have we just given up?

41
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:33,395
We can't have any
food in the house

42
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:34,572
while they tent
for termites.

43
00:01:34,663 --> 00:01:36,251
We're eating everything
in the fridge.

44
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,362
Maw Maw's been over
there an hour already.

45
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,576
It's like having a goat.

46
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:41,365
Oh, be careful.

47
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:43,453
Apparently she's in a bit
of a mood today.

48
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,542
She hit a kid at day care.

49
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:46,784
Here we go.

50
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,770
I told you!

51
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:50,380
What?

52
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,089
Did she really hit a kid?

53
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:53,589
Yeah, she hit a kid;
kids hit kids, what?

54
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:55,711
It's starting!

55
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:56,972
What's starting?

56
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,100
Jimmy, you know how
those Kardashian girls

57
00:02:00,197 --> 00:02:02,609
all have real big butts?

58
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:05,140
Then you look at their mother,
and she's got a big butt, too?

59
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:09,031
Hope's mother was
a serial killer.

60
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:10,364
Oh, come on! She's a baby!

61
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:12,619
John Wayne Gacy was a baby, too.

62
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:14,122
And so was Ted Bundy!

63
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:15,611
And remember Son of Sam?

64
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,655
<i>At one point,
Sam was walking around going</i>

66
00:02:19,604 --> 00:02:20,789
It's not just Lucy.

67
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:22,788
This kid's grandparents are
whackjobs, too.

68
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:24,130
They're in prison for ying to
kidnap this kid!

69
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,659
Are they still in prison?

70
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,953
Yeah, I see the dad
all the time on Highway 8,

71
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:29,419
picking up trash
with the work crew.

72
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,295
He looks good, but who wouldn't
look good in a jumpsuit?

73
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,677
She just hit one kid, I'm sure
it's nothing to worry about.

74
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:35,669
Finished.

75
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:36,897
Good job, Maw Maw.

76
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,176
Ah.

77
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:40,157
Where's all
the refrigerator magnets?

78
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:41,759
What?

79
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:43,288
All those fruit-shaped magnets
that were on the freezer.

80
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:49,660
Uh...

81
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:58,082
(thump)

82
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,719

<i>OPERATOR: If you'd like to make a
call, please hang up and kill again.</i>

84

(toy playing "Pop Goes the
Weasel")

85
00:03:42,377 --> 00:03:44,049
(eerie music plays)

86
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,629
Aah!

87
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,991
(panting)

88
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:16,503
Termites, huh?

89
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:18,857
Yep, poor little
wood-eating bastards.

90
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,181
They see the tent going up,

91
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:21,349
they probably think they're at
the circus.

92
00:04:21,407 --> 00:04:23,627
(loud laughing)

93
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:26,079
Hey, give me those!

94
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:28,467
I'm gonna put all the baby
stuff in the storage pod.

95
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:30,809
Listen, the termite guy's gonna
turn on the gas soon.

96
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:32,947
Since I'm pretty sure nothing's
gonna happen tonight,

97
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,891
I think we got five minutes; we
can sneak inside for a quickie.

98
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,647
Even if the termite
guy catches us,

99
00:04:36,732 --> 00:04:38,312
he seems very discrete.

100
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,228
Hey, I love doing it
in tents, too.

101
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,783
But since what usually
takes you five minutes

102
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,955
sometimes takes me ten,
I got to pass.

103
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:48,023
All right.

104
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:49,480
So, you put all the furniture
the same way it was

105
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,031
in the house.
What that really necessary?

106
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,099
Since we're gonna be sleeping
out here for two nights,

107
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,727
I didn't want Maw Maw
to get confused.

108
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:56,795
Even on her normal nights, e might
accidentally pee in the hamper.

109
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,139
I'm heading to work.

110
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:00,794
Uh, there's something I need
to do first.

111
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:02,424
I'll see you.

112
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:10,318
So, where do we go
to the bathroom?

113
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:11,817
Where you always go.

114
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:13,403
The bathroom!

115
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,115
(chuckles)

116
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,327
Damn it, Burt!
That's my good bucket!

117
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:18,441
Not anymore!

118
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,328
My... slipper's running away!

119
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,313
(grunting)

120
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:31,425
Can I help you?

121
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:33,292
Uh, I need to talk
to one of the prisoners?

122
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,456
He's my daughter's grandfather.

123
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:36,988
The guy with the pigtails.

124
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,178
Take off, son.

125
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:44,264
In here, he's
nobody's grandfather.

126
00:05:44,342 --> 00:05:46,002
Go on! Get!

127
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:52,027
Hey! Dale!

128
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:53,526
Oh, hey, Jimmy, hi.

129
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,310
- How you doing?
- Not so good.

130
00:05:55,364 --> 00:05:58,193
I'm in jail, and
as you can see by my hairstyle

131
00:05:58,288 --> 00:05:59,820
I've had to make
a few compromises

132
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:01,128
in order to ensure my safety.

133
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:06,707
Hello again.

134
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:08,206
How-how's Hope?

135
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:10,956
Good, good. Hey, I was wondering
if I could ask you a question.

136
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:13,044
Well sure, you...

137
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,027
Hey!
When Lucy was Hope's age,

138
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:18,365
- did she hit other kids?
- Yeah.

139
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:20,336
Then around two years old,
she started biting.

140
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,254
And right around three,
she graduated to light stabbing.

141
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:25,561
Thanks, that's all I needed!

142
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:35,852
James, what are you doing?

143
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:37,903
I don't know, making an animal.

144
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:41,529
That's a cat. People are going
to think that's cat meat.

145
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:43,562
That's 90% beef; make a cow.

146
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:44,700
Sorry.

147
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:47,135
Guys, what if my parents are
right?

148
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:48,925
I mean, Lucy hit kids, too.

149
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,408
What if this is the start

150
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,250
of Hope turning into
a serial killer?

151
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,090
That's crazy; just 'cause
Hope's mom stabbed somebody.

152
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,343
- And shot someone.
- And strangled someone.

153
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,678
And poisoned someone.

154
00:06:57,746 --> 00:06:59,221
<i>Okay, we all watched the Geraldo
special,</i>

155
00:06:59,223 --> 00:07:00,519
what's your point?

156
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,414
That nurture is more
important than nature.

157
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:04,468
I mean, how you raise her
is gonna make her who she is.

158
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:07,446
Sabrina's right;
nurture is everything.

159
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,784
My parents were lesbians,
but I'm not a lesbian.

160
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:11,237
I do like
women, though.

161
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:13,733
Oh, tric math
on this one.

162
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:16,473
But I love my parents.

163
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,776
My dad always pushed me hard to
become an Olympic gymnast.

164
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:21,271
I never made it to the Olympics,
but hey...

165
00:07:28,775 --> 00:07:31,581
My point is, kids react to the
environment they're raised in.

166
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,663
Hope will be fine.

167
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,637
Plus, it's not like
she's been exposed

168
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,356
to a lot of violence or
conflict, right?

169
00:07:39,003 --> 00:07:40,967
(smoke alarm rings) JIMMY:
You burnt the toast again?!

170
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:42,836
You have to stop being
distracted by the TV!

171
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,177
I'm sorry! That commercial

172
00:07:44,253 --> 00:07:46,505
for Crazy Michael's
Appliance Store was on

173
00:07:46,594 --> 00:07:48,346
and I can't decide
if he's an actor

174
00:07:48,421 --> 00:07:51,645
or if he's really
crazy... I'm mesmerized!

175
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:55,861
Stop it!

176
00:07:55,936 --> 00:07:57,022
(engine sputtering)

177
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:00,485
Oh! My battery's
dead again.

178
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:01,718
Have you been using my
headlights

179
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,197
to practice your stupid shadow
puppets?

180
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:06,417
Stupid? I found a great one last
night.

181
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,609
What's that look like to you?

182
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,813
It looks like an idiot who keeps
leaving my headlights on.

183
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:13,285
Wrong! Moose antlers!

184
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:16,923
Oh, damn it, Jimmy!

185
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:18,019
You're a grown man.

186
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:19,840
When are you gonna stop
spilling drinks?

187
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:20,986
Ow!

188
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,165
Ow.
Ow!

189
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,509
I got to go.

190
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,959
James?

191
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,015
Can I get three pounds
of the cat?

192
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:39,475
So, no more arguing,
no more fighting.

193
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:40,645
Nothing.

194
00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:42,554
Look, Jimmy, I'm all
for making sure

195
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:43,759
she doesn't murder
us one day.

196
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:45,180
But why
worry now?

197
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:47,480
She's ill got that
big soft spot on her head.

198
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,525
It's like
an emergency kill switch.

199
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:50,982
You know what
babies are like.

200
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:53,066
One day they're crawling,
next day they're walking.

201
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:54,780
One day they can't even use
a spoon.

202
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:56,199
The next day,
they're stabbing you.

203
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:00,291
He's right.

204
00:09:00,437 --> 00:09:02,211
She can walk now,
she can pick stuff up.

205
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:03,528
Those are
the two most important things

206
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,098
you need to know how to do
to kill somebody.

207
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:08,385
As long as we show her that
people should be kind,

208
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,758
keep everything peaceful,
and don't raise our voices...

209
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,433
I think we'll be okay.

210
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:14,088
BURT:
We can't let our guard down.

211
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:15,798
I love her, but I'm gonna sleep
with one eye open

212
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,116
till she moves out
of this house.

213
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,052
And in this family, that could
be a long, long time.

214
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,059
Virginia!

215
00:09:23,122 --> 00:09:25,768
Did you bring my guitar out
like I asked?

216
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:27,195
No, I was going to,
but that

217
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:29,899
Crazy Mike commercial
came on, nd I got sucked in.

218
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:31,723
I swear, if
that guy doesn't

219
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:34,701
really have Tourette's, he's
freaking DeNiro. Virginia!

220
00:09:34,747 --> 00:09:36,062
I told you I wanted to play
around the campfire!

221
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:37,184
I can't believe this!

222
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:38,748
Shh!

223
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:41,924
Okey-dokey!

224
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,582
I'll go get it!

225
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,621
Whoa-whoah! You're not
going in there, are you?

226
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:47,880
What about
the chemicals?

227
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:49,435
I'll hold my breath
and close my eyes.

228
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:50,445
It'll be like
eating Indian food.

229
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,111
(inhales)

230
00:10:17,105 --> 00:10:18,960
(gasps)

231
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,628
I got it!

232
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:29,926
That's a lamp.

233
00:10:29,976 --> 00:10:33,225
What did I go in there for?

234
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:34,453
A guitar.

235
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:38,499
(sighs, inhales)

236
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:44,091
(grunts)

237
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:46,234
(playing rhythm of "If Y're
Happy and You Know It")

238
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:48,026
 There's a skeeter
on my peter 

239
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:49,475
 Get it off

240
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:51,445
(coughs)

241
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:53,031
 There's a dozen
on my cousin 

242
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,702
 You can hear the
suckers buzzin' 

243
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:57,818
(coughing)

244
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,788
(sighs): I could get used
to a world without roofs.

245
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:03,931
I love the fresh air.

246
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:05,618
And I hate roofers.

247
00:11:07,044 --> 00:11:08,997
(thunder rumbles)

248
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,768
Rain!

249
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,833
Burt, did you check the weather?

250
00:11:12,878 --> 00:11:14,647
No, I did not.

251
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:32,266
Hey!

252
00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:33,551
Put everything I could

253
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:35,863
into the car, just
to make room in here.

254
00:11:35,913 --> 00:11:39,037
My pickup has the clothes,
Jimmy's van has the food.

255
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,000
And Virginia's got
junk in her trunk.

256
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:42,546
(laughs):
Hey! Junk in the trunk!

257
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:43,791
I just got that.

258
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:45,206
You good,
Maw Maw?

259
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:49,074
Train travel... it's
the only way to see America.

260
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:52,969
Okay, well... we're
going through a tunnel!

261
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,852
VIRGINIA: Okay, well, I'm
going out to the van

262
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:56,468
to get some food.

263
00:11:56,546 --> 00:11:57,909
It's pretty dark
out there.

264
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,432
So, for dinner tonight we're
either having flank steak,

265
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:02,346
or floormats.

266
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:11,107
(man whooping wildly over TV)

267
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:17,266
So come on down...
(making zany noises)

268
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:24,869
Do any of you butt lumps need
a damn clock radio?

269
00:12:24,951 --> 00:12:27,645
I need one,
I need at least three!

270
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,643
I need three to control my mind!
Whoo! (Crazy laugh)

271
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,120
 Clock radio!

272
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,447
Want to buy a DVD? (Honking)

273
00:12:36,497 --> 00:12:38,929
Ron Paul for President.

274
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:42,528
What are you?

275
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,331
Living in these pods
isn't so bad.

276
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,288
I wonder what poor people do
when their houses get tented

277
00:12:46,581 --> 00:12:48,359
and they have no place to live.

278
00:12:48,447 --> 00:12:50,794
This is what poor people do;
we're poor.

279
00:12:51,986 --> 00:12:53,583
Still, it's not so bad.

280
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:55,102
Aah!

281
00:12:55,162 --> 00:12:56,326
Oh, crap!

282
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,240
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

283
00:12:59,306 --> 00:13:00,527
Whoo!

284
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:02,575
Whoo-whoo! (Gasping)

285
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:06,317
Whoah!

286
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:09,006
Whoah, yourself, sock-burner!

287
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,207
Sorry, I got distracted
by the neighbor's TV.

288
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:12,459
Aw, you're always
doing that!

289
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:13,873
It's like you have ADD.

290
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:15,382
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

291
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,329
Not in front
of the anger sponge.

292
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,830
Look at us,
being affectionate.

293
00:13:22,894 --> 00:13:24,684
and not murdering each other.

294
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,587
This is the norm.

295
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:37,462
Ow.

296
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:39,792
Where you going?

297
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:41,660
Going to the gas
station to potty.

298
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:44,156
Just try the bucket chair,
just to say you did it.

299
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,044
Why would I want
to say that?

300
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,361
Got to go, got to go,
got to go-go-go.

301
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:50,570
Got to go, got to go, got to go!

302
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,530
Got to go! Got to go! Got to go!

303
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,026
Okay, I'm gonna go.

304
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,035
I'm going.

305
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,093
(sighs)

306
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,732
(engine sputters)
No, no, no.

307
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:03,754
No! No! Aah!

308
00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:07,677
Did you leave the lights
on in my car last night?

309
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:09,101
Uh, maybe.

310
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:11,060
Damn it! The battery's dead

311
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,932
and the other cars are
too full to drive!

312
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,236
Ah, dat, dat, dat...
Baby's awake.

313
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:20,115
Hey, hon!
Hi, pumpkin!

314
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,910
(groaning)
Ah, oooh.

315
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:30,925
(panting)

316
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:34,590
Ahh...

317
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:38,755
Boo-ya!

318
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,465
Take a picture,
it'll last longer!

319
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:51,394
Hey!

320
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:53,033
Wait! Hey, you!

321
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:56,606
Technically, with my head just
over the steering wheel,

322
00:14:56,702 --> 00:14:58,695
I can see a good part of the
side view mirror

323
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,198
from the reflection
in my windshield

324
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,397
that was reflecting
off the empty aquarium

325
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,368
in the passenger seat.

326
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,068
You need an unobstructed view.

327
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,627
And did I mention
the reflection in the aquarium?

328
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,957
Look, if you want to live out of
your van, that's your business.

329
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:10,101
But don't drive it around.

330
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:11,709
I don't live in the van.

331
00:15:11,775 --> 00:15:13,876
Actually, currently I live in
the storage pod,

332
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:15,961
(laughs):
which is a funny story.

333
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:17,838
Because I have
termites, and...

334
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:19,886
You're still writing me
that ticket.

335
00:15:19,956 --> 00:15:22,164
Okay, well, that is good

336
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:24,003
because it gives
me another chance

337
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:26,800
to practice my maturity and my
ability to not get mad,

338
00:15:26,896 --> 00:15:29,055
even though I am now
very late for work.

339
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:30,138
So...

340
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:32,646
thank you, all's dandy!

341
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:40,330
("Under Pressure" plays)

342
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:43,905
 Pressure, pushing down on me

343
00:15:43,972 --> 00:15:49,081
 Pressing down on you, no man
ask for, under pressure 

344
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:51,115
 That brings a building down
(sneezes)

345
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:55,923
 Splits a family in two,
puts people on streets 

346
00:15:55,984 --> 00:15:59,152
 Um ba ba be, um ba ba be...

347
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,043
(blowing nose)

348
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:00,951
(groans)

349
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:05,554
Two hundred dollars?!

350
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,878
Where the hell am I going to get
that kind of money, man?

351
00:16:08,964 --> 00:16:09,967
I mean...

352
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:11,716
I pay for food
when I get hungry!

353
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:14,180
I don't just get to go to the
restaurant and eat for free

354
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,439
because of some stupid badge on
my shirt!

355
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,844
Say what you want about me,

356
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:19,341
but please don't
disrespect the badge.

357
00:16:19,398 --> 00:16:21,646
Why don't you use your badge to
catch some real criminals?

358
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:25,532
You idiot! You ridiculous,
stupid idiot!

359
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,946
Sir, pick that up, or I'll have
to cite you for littering.

360
00:16:29,018 --> 00:16:31,488
Littering? Seriously?
You want to see littering?

361
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,701
I'm gonna make it rain, bitch!

362
00:16:33,797 --> 00:16:37,245
Whoo! How you gonna give a
ticket without your ticket book?

363
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:40,545
You stupid beeaaa...

364
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:42,152
(stun gun clicking)
(gurgling)

365
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,712
Well, I can't reach my parents,

366
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:52,842
but, uh, my friend says she can
pick me up around dinner.

367
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:55,466
So, do I just sit
around here all day?

368
00:16:55,549 --> 00:16:58,747
Oh, no.
Since the state budget cuts,

369
00:16:58,803 --> 00:17:01,434
no one gets to just sit around.

370
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:06,760
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

371
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:09,062
You know, I'm just glad Hope
wasn't there to see it.

372
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,526
I really lost my temper.

373
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,478
Right, you never want to
let a child see you upset.

374
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:16,067
Exactly. That's a whole thing
we're working on at the house.

375
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:20,403
Well, kudos. We made a point
never to argue in front of Lucy.

376
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:24,299
Really? You
never argued?

377
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:25,616
I figured you
guys argued a lot

378
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,712
and that's what
made Lucy violent.

379
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:30,921
<i>Hey, ese, I found
your underwear.</i>

380
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:37,171
It's very important
for a child's environment

381
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:38,805
that the role models
around them

382
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,895
make a consistent and
conspicuous effort

383
00:17:40,968 --> 00:17:42,298
to keep calm.

384
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,299
That's right, you
don't wear underwear.

385
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,149
And here's your
dirty diaper.

386
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:52,474
That's it!
I'm done!

387
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:54,403
Race war!

388
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,142
(grunting and groaning)

389
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,776
<i>Hit him, not me, estupido!</i>

390
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,781
(grunting)

391
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,002
JIMMY: And then he says,
they never argued

392
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:12,767
at all around Lucy, and
she wasn't allowed

393
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:13,851
to argue, either.

394
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,774
Which is probably why,
later in life,

395
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,208
when she had a conflict with
someone,

396
00:18:17,294 --> 00:18:18,830
she stuck an
ice-pick in their eye.

397
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,356
And neck.

398
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:21,979
<i>And ear. Man, I wish we'd taped
that Geraldo special.</i>

399
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:23,394
JIMMY:
But the point is,

400
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:24,893
- you have to let off steam.
- Right.

401
00:18:24,974 --> 00:18:26,435
It's like when you stick a cork

402
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:27,722
in one of those cartoon
tea-kettles.

403
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,145
Yes. You get fat, red,
angry and explode.

404
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,478
I mean, that's what happened
to me today.

405
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,533
If we're not careful,
it'll happen to all of us.

406
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:37,011
Actually, I had a little bit
of an incident myself today.

407
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:55,158
(metalllic screechg)

408
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:07,698
I might've lost my temper
a little today, too.

409
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,603
I want a fish dog.

410
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,645
No onions, extra pickle.

411
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:13,890
Onions and pickle.

412
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:16,345
No onions. Extra pickle.

413
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:17,609
On a fish dog.

414
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:20,856
Extra pickle. No onions. Hm?

415
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:24,203
Ah.

416
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:29,420
Huh.

417
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,620
No onions, extra pickles?

418
00:19:34,723 --> 00:19:37,641
Virginia, I think I got yours!

419
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:39,610
Yeah, I was embarrassed,
but at the same time,

420
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,222
I was pretty impressed that I
still fit

421
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,754
through the drive-thru window.

422
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:44,516
It's not that impressive,
considering the first time

423
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,130
you did it, you were
pregnant with Jimmy.

424
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:48,933
(laughing)

425
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,060
<i>JIMMY: You put any four
people in a house together,</i>

426
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:52,596
<i>and they're gonna argue
a little.</i>

427
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,559
<i>When you throw in the fact that
they do stupid things,</i>

428
00:19:55,615 --> 00:19:57,762
<i>over and over again,</i>

429
00:19:57,814 --> 00:20:00,121
<i>they're gonna argue a lot.</i>

430
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,774
<i>But the good thing about
arguing is it lets you get out</i>

431
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:05,737
<i>all the bad so you can make
room for the good.</i>

432
00:20:05,794 --> 00:20:06,749
(alarm stops)

433
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:13,331
(chuckling)

434
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:16,552
<i>It's not that important whether
or not you get mad,</i>

435
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:17,486
<i>'cause you're probably gonna.</i>

436
00:20:17,487 --> 00:20:19,984
<i>What's important, is what
you do afterwards.</i>

437
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,638
<i>So, you're gonna see us argue
from time to time.</i>

438
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,799
But you're also gonna see
us laugh.

439
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:28,898
'Cause a lot of families might
argue less than we do,

440
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,519
but no family laughs more
than we do.

441
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:34,110
And don't worry about all that
serial killer stuff.

442
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:37,107
I don't think, deep down,
anyone really thinks

443
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,269
that you're gonna kill us.

444
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:42,535
Did you lock
the bedroom door?

445
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:43,863
Damn right,
I did.

446
