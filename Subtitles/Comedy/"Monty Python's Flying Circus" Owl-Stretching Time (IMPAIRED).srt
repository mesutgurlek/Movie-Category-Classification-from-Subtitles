00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:25,040
( grunting )

3
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,417
( breathing heavily )

4
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:36,250
IT'S...

5
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:40,252
MONTY PYTHON'S FL YING CIRCUS.

6
00:00:40,297 --> 00:00:49,001

10
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:11,519
( audience laughs )

11
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:14,760
( plays major chord )

12
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,907
WELL, HELLO THERE AGAIN,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

13
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:30,879
THIS TIME WE'D LIKE TO UP THE
TEMPO A LITTLE, CHANGE THE MOOD.

14
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:34,748
WE'VE GOT A NUMBER REQUESTED
BY PIP, PAULINE, NIGEL, TARQUIN

15
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:36,877
AND OLD SPOTTY--
TARQUIN'S MOTHER.

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,286
IT'S A LITTLE NUMBER
SPECIALLY WRITTEN

17
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:42,086
FOR THE PUBESCENCE
OF EX-KING ZOG OF ALBANIA

18
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,150
AND IT'S ENTITLED "ART GALLERY."

19
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:45,626
HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

20
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:52,127
( scattered laughter )

21
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:02,111
HELLO, MARGE.

22
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:03,645
OH, HELLO, JANET.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,113
HOW ARE YOU, LOVE?

24
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:06,614
FANCY SEEING YOU.

25
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,708
HOW'S LITTLE RALPH?

26
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:08,877
OH, DON'T ASK ME.

27
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:11,409
HE'S BEEN NOTHING BUT
TROUBLE ALL MORNING.

28
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:13,046
STOP IT, RALPH,
STOP IT!

29
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:14,113
( slaps )

30
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,784
SAME AS MY KEVIN--
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

31
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:17,850
LEAVE IT ALONE.

32
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:19,088
( slaps )

33
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:21,120
HE'S JUST BEEN IN
THE FLORENTINE ROOM

34
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:22,529
AND SMEARED
TOMATO KETCHUP

35
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:24,260
ALL OVER RAPHAEL'S
BABYJESUS.

36
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,290
OH...

37
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,326
PUT THAT BAROQUE
MASTERPIECE DOWN!

38
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,770
WELL, WE'VE JUST COME
FROM THE COURTAULD

39
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:32,138
AND RALPH SMASHED
EVERY EXHIBIT BUT ONE

40
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:35,110
IN THE DANISH CONTEMPORARY
SCULPTURE EXHIBITION.

41
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:36,669
JUST LIKE MY KEVIN.

42
00:02:36,713 --> 00:02:38,476
SHOW HIM
AN EXHIBITION

43
00:02:38,515 --> 00:02:41,484
OF EARLY-18th-CENTURY
DRESDEN POTTERY

44
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:43,145
AND HE GOES BERSERK.

45
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:45,484
NO, I SAID NO,
AND I MEANT NO!

46
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:46,489
( slaps )

47
00:02:46,523 --> 00:02:48,047
THIS MORNING
WE WERE VIEWING

48
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:49,490
THE EARLY
FLEMISH MASTERS

49
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:51,858
OF THE RENAISSANCE
AND MANNERISTS SCHOOLS

50
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:53,795
WHEN HE GETS OUT
HIS BLACK AEROSOL

51
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,094
AND SQUIRTS VERMEER'S
LADYATA WINDOW.

52
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:58,532
STILL, IT'S NOT AS BAD
AS SPITTING, IS IT?

53
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:00,968
NO, WELL...
KEVIN KNOWS...

54
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:01,993
( slaps )

55
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:03,801
IF HE SPITS
AT A PAINTING

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,003
I'LL NEVER TAKE HIM
TO AN EXHIBITION AGAIN.

57
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:08,670
RALPH USED TO SPIT.

58
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:11,738
HE COULD HIT A VAN GOGH
AT 30 YARDS, YES...

59
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:14,113
BUT HE KNOWS NOW
IT'S WRONG.

60
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:15,651
DON'T YOU, RALPH?

61
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:16,879
RALPH, STOP IT.

62
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,887
STOP IT!

63
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,980
STOP CHEWING
THAT TURNER!

64
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:21,650
YOU ARE?!

65
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:25,218
YOU ARE A NAUGHTY,
NAUGHTY, VICIOUS
LITTLE BOY!

66
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:26,387
( slapping )

67
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:27,396
( slaps )

68
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,556
OH, LOOK AT THAT.

69
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,293
THE FIGHTING
TEMERAIRE, RUINED.

70
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,459
WHAT SHALL I DO?

71
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,332
DON'T DO ANYTHING
WITH IT, LOVE.

72
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,338
JUST PUT IT IN
THE BIN OVER THERE.

73
00:03:35,372 --> 00:03:36,361
REALLY?

74
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:38,135
YES, TAKE MY WORD
FOR IT, MARGE--

75
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:41,871
KEVIN'S EATEN MOST OF
THE EARLY-19th-CENTURY
BRITISH LANDSCAPE ARTISTS

76
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:43,469
AND I'VE LEARNED
NOT TO WORRY.

77
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:44,537
AS A MATTER OF FACT

78
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:46,048
I FEEL A BIT
PECKISH MYSELF.

79
00:03:46,082 --> 00:03:47,071
YES...

80
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:48,106
I NEVER...

81
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:49,379
( laughter )

82
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:51,148
I NEVER USED
TO LIKE TURNER.

83
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,314
NO... I DON'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT ART

84
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:54,789
BUT I KNOW
WHAT I LIKE.

85
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:55,813
YES.

86
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:02,896
I THINK UTRILLO'S BRUSHWORK
IS FANTASTIC

87
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:05,992
BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS
AGREE WITH ME...

88
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:08,196
( belches )

89
00:04:08,238 --> 00:04:11,105
NOT AFTER A RUBENS, ANYWAY.

90
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:13,199
ALL THOSE CHERRIES, OOH.

91
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,040
UGH...

92
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:17,410
GOT VERMEER ALL DOWN MY SHIRT.

93
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:20,041
WATTEAU, DEAR?

94
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,574
WHAT A TERRIBLE JOKE.

95
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:23,711
BUT IT'S
MY ONLY LINE.

96
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:24,845
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT

97
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,116
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY IT.

98
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,816
YOU COULD HAVE KEPT
QUIET FOR A CHANGE.

99
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:29,256
THAT'S TYPICAL--
TALK, TALK, TALK

100
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:30,281
NATTER, NATTER, NATTER.

101
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:48,743
Man:
CUT TO ME.

102
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:50,143

ADVERTISING DIVISION

104
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:55,377
I OBJECT, IN THE STRONGEST
POSSIBLE TERMS

105
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:57,079
TO THIS OBVIOUS REFERENCE

106

THAT ANY RECURRENCE

00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,957
OF THIS SLOPPY, LONGHAIRED
CIVILIAN PLAGIARISM

110
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:11,228
WILL BE DEALT WITH
MOST SEVERELY.

111
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:15,636
RIGHT, NOW ON THE COMMAND "CUT,"
CAMERA WILL CUT TO CAMERA TWO.

112
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:17,196
ALL RIGHT, DIRECTOR...

113
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,832
WAIT FOR IT.

114
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,035
( laughter )

115
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:21,941
CAMERA... CUT.

116
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:24,412
THIS IS MY ONLY LINE.

117
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:25,846
( catcalls )

118
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:28,077
( defensively ):
WELL, IT'S MY ONLY LINE.

WAIT A MINUTE.

135
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:02,248
I'VE ALREADY WARNED THIS PROGRAM

136
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:05,220
ABOUT INFRINGING THE ARMY
COPYRIGHT OF OUR SLOGAN:

AND I'M WARNING YOU,
IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN

139
00:11:10,726 --> 00:11:13,957
I SHALL COME DOWN ON THIS
PROGRAM LIKE A TON OF BRICKS.

140
00:11:13,996 --> 00:11:14,963
RIGHT.

141
00:11:14,997 --> 00:11:16,430
CARRY ON, SERGEANT MAJOR.

142
00:11:16,465 --> 00:11:17,989
SIR!

143
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,433
GOOD EVENING,
CLASS.

144
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:20,435
GOOD EVENING.

145
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:21,436
WHERE'S ALL THE OTHERS, THEN?

146
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,437
NOT HERE.

147
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:23,369
I CAN SEE THAT.

148
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:25,101
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THEM?

149
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:26,267
DON'T KNOW.

150
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:27,674
PERHAPS THEY'VE GOT FLU.

151
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,677
FLU?

152
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:29,871
FLU?!

153
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:32,312
THEY'VE EATEN
TOO MUCH FRESH FRUIT.

154
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:34,111
RIGHT! NOW, SELF-DEFENSE.

155
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,779
TONIGHT I SHALL BE CARRYING ON
FROM WHERE I GOT TO LAST WEEK

156
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,516
WHEN I WAS SHOWING YOU
HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF

157

AGAINST ANYONE WHO ATTACKS YOU

158

ARMED WITH A PIECE
OF FRESH FRUIT.

159

OH... YOU PROMISED

160
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:48,092
YOU WOULDN'T DO
FRUIT THIS WEEK.

161
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:48,721
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

162
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:49,788
WE'VE DONE
FRESH FRUIT

163
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:50,924
FOR THE LAST
NINE WEEKS.

164
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:51,934
WHAT'S WRONG WITH FRUIT?

165
00:11:51,968 --> 00:11:53,162
YOU THINK YOU KNOW IT ALL, EH?

166
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:55,033
CAN'T WE DO
SOMETHING ELSE
FOR A CHANGE?

167
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:57,505
LIKE SOMEONE WHO ATTACKS YOU
WITH A POINTED STICK?

168
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,508
POINTED STICKS?

169
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:00,975
OH, OH, OH.

170
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,501
WE WANT TO LEARN HOW
TO DEFEND OURSELVES

171
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:05,446
AGAINST POINTED
STICKS, DO WE?

172
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:07,472
GETTING ALL HIGH
AND MIGHTY, EH?

173
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:10,041
FRESH FRUIT NOT GOOD
ENOUGH FOR YOU, EH?

174
00:12:10,086 --> 00:12:11,553
OH, WELL, WELL...

175
00:12:11,587 --> 00:12:14,818
( shouting ):
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, MY LAD!

176
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:16,882
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING
HOME TONIGHT

177
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:19,520
AND SOME HOMICIDAL
MANIAC COMES AFTER YOU

178
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:21,291
WITH A BUNCH
OF LOGANBERRIES

179
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,820
DON'T COME CRYING TO ME!

180
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:24,730
RIGHT... THE PASSION FRUIT.

181
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,997
WHEN YOUR ASSAILANT
LUNGES AT YOU

182
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:29,004
WITH A PASSION FRUIT THUS...

183
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:30,767
ALL:
WE'VE DONE THE PASSION FRUIT.

184
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:31,295
WHAT?

185
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,808
WE'VE DONE THE
PASSION FRUIT.

186
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:36,243
WE'VE DONE
ORANGES, APPLES,
GRAPEFRUITS...

187
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,371
WHOLE AND
SEGMENTS.

188
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:38,846
POMEGRANATES,
GREENGAGES.

189
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:40,143
GRAPES,
PASSION FRUITS.

190
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:41,238
LEMONS.

191
00:12:41,284 --> 00:12:42,251
PLUMS.

192
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:43,650
YEAH, AND
MANGOES
IN SYRUP.

193
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:44,710
HOW ABOUT CHERRIES?

194
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:45,846
ALL:
WE DONE THEM.

195
00:12:45,888 --> 00:12:46,718
RED AND BLACK?

196
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:47,450
ALL:
YES.

197
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,358
ALL RIGHT, THEN... BANANAS!

198
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:52,486
( groaning )

199
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:53,552
WE HAVEN'T DONE THEM, HAVE WE?

200
00:12:53,596 --> 00:12:55,359
RIGHT! BANANAS...

201
00:12:55,398 --> 00:13:00,426
HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF AGAINST
A MAN ARMED WITH A BANANA.

202
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:02,528
HERE... YOU, TAKE THIS.

203
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:03,697
NOW, IT'S
QUITE SIMPLE

204
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:04,728
TO DEFEND YOURSELF

205
00:13:04,774 --> 00:13:06,935
AGAINST THE BANANA FIEND!

206
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:11,003
FIRST OF ALL, YOU FORCE HIM
TO DROP THE BANANA!

207
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:14,813
NEXT YOU EAT THE BANANA,
THUS DISARMING HIM.

208
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,818
YOU HAVE NOW
RENDERED HIM HELPLESS.

209
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:18,114
SUPPOSE HE'S GOT A BUNCH?

210
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:19,916
SHUT UP!

211
00:13:19,956 --> 00:13:21,947
SUPPOSING HE'S GOT
A POINTED STICK?

212
00:13:21,991 --> 00:13:23,253
SHUT UP!

213
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:25,123
RIGHT, NOW... YOU, MR. APRICOT.

214
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:26,128
HARRISON.

215
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:27,129
HARRISON,
MR. HARRISON.

216
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:28,720
COME AT ME WITH
THAT BANANA THEN.

217
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,629
COME ON, ATTACK ME WITH IT,
AS HARD AS YOU LIKE, COME ON.

218
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,690
NO, NO

219
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:32,860
NO, NO, NO!

220
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:35,427
PUT SOMETHING INTO IT,
FOR GOD'S SAKE!

221
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:36,438
HOLD IT LIKE THAT.

222
00:13:36,472 --> 00:13:37,439
SCREAM.

223
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:38,497
NOW, COME ON.

224
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,008
COME ON, ATTACK ME.

225
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,304
COME ON, COME ON

226
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:42,368
COME ON.

227
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:43,605
( screaming )

228
00:13:43,646 --> 00:13:45,409
( gunshot )

229
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,110
NOW...

230
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,143
( laughter and applause )

231
00:13:52,254 --> 00:13:53,687
NOW I EAT THE BANANA!

232
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:54,712
HE'S DEAD.

233
00:13:54,757 --> 00:13:55,724
YOU SHOT HIM.

234
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:57,020
HE'S COMPLETELY
DEAD.

235
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:58,048
YOU SHOT HIM.

236
00:13:58,094 --> 00:14:00,289
( mumbling )

237
00:14:03,632 --> 00:14:05,896
I HAVE NOW EATEN THE BANANA!

238
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:09,234
THE DECEASED, MR. APRICOT,
IS NOW DISARMED.

239
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:10,636
YOU SHOT HIM.

240
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:12,641
YOU SHOT
HIM DEAD.

241
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:14,438
WELL, HE WAS ATTACKING ME
WITH A BANANA.

242
00:14:14,477 --> 00:14:15,637
WELL, YOU
TOLD HIM TO.

243
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:17,202
LOOK, I'M ONLY DOING MY JOB.

244
00:14:17,246 --> 00:14:20,113
I HAVE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DEFEND
YOURSELF AGAINST FRESH FRUIT.

245
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,514
AND POINTED STICKS.

246
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,608
SHUT UP!

247
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:23,879
SUPPOSING SOMEONE COME AT YOU

248
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,409
WITH A BANANA,
AND YOU HAVEN'T GOT A GUN?

249
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:27,388
RUN FOR IT.

250
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:30,119
WELL, YOU COULD STAND
AND SCREAM FOR HELP.

251
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:33,286
YEAH, YEAH, YOU TRY THAT WITH
A PINEAPPLE DOWN YOUR WINDPIPE.

252
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:34,125
PINEAPPLE?

253
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:35,128
WHERE, WHERE?

254
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,131
OH, I WAS JUST
SAYING "PINEAPPLE."

255
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,133
OH, BLIMEY, I THOUGHT
MY NUMBER WAS ON THAT ONE.

256
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:40,135
WHAT, ON THE PINEAPPLE?

257
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:41,227
WHERE, WHERE?

258
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,532
NO, I WAS JUST REPEATING IT.

259
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:43,560
OH, OH, I SEE.

260
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:44,595
RIGHT... WHEW!

261
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,665
THAT'S THE BANANA, THEN.

262
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,609
NEXT, THE RASPBERRY.

263
00:14:48,644 --> 00:14:50,578
HARMLESS-LOOKING THING,
ISN'T IT?

264
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:52,240
NOW, YOU, MR. TINNED PEACH.

265
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:53,077
THOMPSON.

266
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:54,139
MR. THOMPSON.

267
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:55,582
COME AT ME WITH THAT
RASPBERRY, THEN.

268
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,313
COME ON, BE AS VICIOUS

00:14:58,054 --> 00:14:58,816
WHY NOT?

271
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:00,082
YOU'LL SHOOT ME.

272
00:15:00,122 --> 00:15:00,520
I WON'T!

273
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:02,046
YOU SHOT MR. HARRISON.

274
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:03,683
THAT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

275
00:15:03,726 --> 00:15:05,956
COME ON, I PROMISE
I WON'T SHOOT YOU.

276
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:08,054
YOU PROMISED YOU'D TELL US
ABOUT POINTED STICKS.

277
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:09,359
SHUT UP!

278
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,525
NOW, BRANDISH THAT...
BRANDISH THAT RASPBERRY.

279
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:12,864
COME ON!

280
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,699
BE AS VICIOUS
AS YOU LIKE WITH IT, COME ON.

281
00:15:14,737 --> 00:15:15,761
NO, THROW THE GUN AWAY.

282
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:16,396
I HAVEN'T GOT A GUN.

283
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:17,599
OH, YES, YOU HAVE.

284
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,834
I HAVEN'T.

285
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:20,535
YOU HAVE-- YOU SHOT MR. HARRISON
WITH IT.

286
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,009
OH... THAT GUN.

287
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:23,238
WELL, THROW IT AWAY.

288
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,405
ALL RIGHT.

289
00:15:25,714 --> 00:15:28,444
HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF
AGAINST A RASPBERRY

290
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:30,111
WITHOUT A GUN.

291
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:31,244
YOU WERE GOING TO SHOOT ME.

292
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:31,981
I WASN'T, I WASN'T, I WASN'T.

293
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:32,919
YOU WERE.

294
00:15:32,955 --> 00:15:34,115
I WASN'T, I WASN'T.

295
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:35,690
COME ON, COME ON, YOU WORM.

296
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:37,089
YOU MISERABLE LITTLE MAN.

297
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:38,286
COME AT ME, THEN.

298
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:40,124
COME ON, DO YOUR WORST,
YOU WORM.

299
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,697
( screams )

300
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:44,392
( laughter )

301
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:47,368
IF ANYONE EVER ATTACKS YOU
WITH A RASPBERRY

302
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:49,132
SIMPLY PULL THE LEVER

303
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:52,038
AND A 16-TON WEIGHT WILL DROP
ON HIS HEAD.

304
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:53,837
I LEARNED THAT IN MALAYA.

305
00:15:53,876 --> 00:15:56,470
SUPPOSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT
THE 16-TON WEIGHT.

306
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:57,979
WELL, THAT'S PLANNING, ISN'T IT?

307
00:15:58,013 --> 00:15:59,105
FORETHOUGHT.

308
00:15:59,148 --> 00:16:02,777
WELL, HOW MANY 16-TON
WEIGHTS ARE THERE?

309
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:04,911
LOOK! LOOK, SMARTY-PANTS

310
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:08,048
THE 16-TON WEIGHT
IS JUST ONE WAY

311
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,217
JUST ONE WAY!

312
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,318
OF KILLING
THE RASPBERRY KILLER.

313
00:16:12,361 --> 00:16:14,261
THERE ARE MILLIONS
OF OTHERS.

314
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:14,955
LIKE WHAT?

315
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:16,487
SHOOT HIM.

316
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:18,557
WELL, SUPPOSING YOU
HAVEN'T GOT A GUN

317
00:16:18,601 --> 00:16:19,898
OR A 16-TON WEIGHT.

318
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,267
ALL RIGHT, CLEVER DICK,
ALL RIGHT, CLEVER DICK.

319
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:24,363
YOU TWO, COME AT ME
WITH RASPBERRIES, THEN

320
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,805
A WHOLE BASKET EACH.

321
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:27,638
COME ON, COME AT ME
WITH THEM, THEN.

322
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:28,768
NO GUN?

323
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:29,277
NO!

324
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:31,472
NO 16-TON WEIGHT?

325
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:32,674
NO POINTED STICKS?

326
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:33,306
SHUT UP!

327
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:34,976
NO ROCKS UP
IN THE CEILING?

328
00:16:35,017 --> 00:16:35,984
NO!

329
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:36,882
YOU WON'T KILL US?

330
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,817
I WON'T KILL YOU.

331
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:38,615
PROMISE?

332
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:39,814
I PROMISE I WON'T KILL YOU.

333
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:40,947
NOW, ARE YOU GOING
TO ATTACK ME?

334
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,753
Both ( hesitantly ):
ALL RIGHT.

335
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,123
RIGHT, NOW DON'T RUSH ME
THIS TIME.

336
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:48,322
I'M GOING TO TURN ME BACK
SO YOU CAN STALK ME, RIGHT?

337
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:49,797
COME UP
AS QUIETLY
AS YOU CAN

338
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:52,596
RIGHT CLOSE UP BEHIND ME

339
00:16:52,635 --> 00:16:54,603
THEN IN WITH THE RASPBERRIES,
RIGHT?

340
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:56,036
START MOVING!

341
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:57,766
NOW, THE FIRST
THING TO DO

342
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:59,433
WHEN YOU'RE
BEING STALKED

343
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:01,534
BY AN UGLY MOB
WITH RASPBERRIES

344
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:03,169
IS TO RELEASE
THE TIGER.

345
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:04,440
( growls )

346
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,607
( men scream )

347
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:10,085
THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF THE TIGER
IN UNARMED COMBAT IS

348
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:13,087
THAT IT NOT ONLY EATS
THE RASPBERRY-LADEN FOE

349
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:15,089
BUT ALSO THE RASPBERRIES.

350
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:17,682
THE TIGER, HOWEVER,
DOES NOT RELISH THE PEACH.

351
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:20,854
THE PEACH ASSAILANT SHOULD BE
ATTACKED WITH A CROCODILE.

352
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:22,090
RIGHT.

353
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:25,463
NOW, THE REST OF YOU,
I KNOW YOU'RE THERE

354
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,731
LURKING UNDER THE FLOORBOARDS

355
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,295
WITH YOUR DAMSONS
AND YOUR PRUNES

356
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:33,069
HIDING BEHIND THE WALL BARS
WITH YOUR QUINCES.

357
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,769
WELL, I'M READY FOR YOU.

358
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,506
I'VE WIRED MYSELF UP
TO 200 TONS OF GELIGNITE

359
00:17:37,546 --> 00:17:40,014
AND IF ANY OF YOU SO MUCH
AS TRIES ANYTHING

360
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,573
WE'LL ALL GO UP TOGETHER.

361
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:42,914
I WARNED YOU!

362
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:44,112
I WARNED YOU, RIGHT.

363
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,312
THAT'S IT!

364
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:46,616
( explosion )

365
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,587
SAY, HAVE I SHOWN YOU
MY LAST OPERATION?

366
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,598
( laughter )

367
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:59,123
Man:
NOW, WE'VE GOT TO FIND
THAT TUMOR.

368
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:03,604
AHA!

369
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:06,301
NOW, WHERE DOES IT GO?

370
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:08,909
NO, NO.

371
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:13,774
( clanging )

372
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:15,477
Man:
GOOD DAY, HARRY.

373
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:20,455
( humming )

374
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:22,616
( cranking )

375
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:29,161
( laughter )

376
00:19:20,482 --> 00:19:23,178
WELL, NOW WE'D LIKE TO ALTER
THE MOOD A LITTLE.

377
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:25,982
WE'D LIKE TO BRING YOU
SOMETHING FOR MOM AND DAD

378
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:27,955
ANNIE AND ROGER,
MAZARIN AND LOUIS

379
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,958
AND ALL AT VERSAILLES.

380
00:19:29,992 --> 00:19:33,951
IT'S A LITTLE NUMBER CALLED
"ENGLAND'S MOUNTAINS GREEN."

381
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:35,463
HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

382
00:19:39,702 --> 00:19:43,798
( sheep baaing )

383
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:49,770
YES, YOU KNOW, IT'S A MAN'S LIFE
IN ENGLAND'S MOUNTAINS GREEN.

384
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:51,211
RIGHT, I HEARD THAT,
I HEARD THAT.

385
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:52,679
I'M GOING TO STOP
THIS SKETCH NOW.

386
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:54,012
AND IF THERE'S
ANY MORE OF THIS

387
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:55,539
I'M GOING TO STOP
THE WHOLE PROGRAM.

388
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,779
I THOUGHT IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT TEETH ANYWAY.

389
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,617
WHY DON'T YOU
DO SOMETHING
ABOUT TEETH?

390
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:00,622
GO ON.

391
00:20:00,656 --> 00:20:01,953
( laughter )

392
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,288
WHAT ABOUT MY RUSTIC MONOLOGUE?

393
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:06,794
I'M NOT SLEEPING
WITH THAT PRODUCER AGAIN.

394
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,126
( laughter )

395
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:11,132
EXCITEMENT... DRAMA...

396
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,566
ACTION... VIOLENCE...

397
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:15,331
FRESH FRUIT... PASSION...

398
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:18,238
THRILLS... SPILLS...

399
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:21,333
ROMANCE... ADVENTURE...

400
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:24,869
ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN READ
ABOUT IN A BOOK.

401
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:33,146
( scattered laughter )

402
00:20:33,222 --> 00:20:35,281
AH... OH.

403
00:20:35,324 --> 00:20:37,292
GOOD MORNING--
I'D LIKE TO BUY A BOOK, PLEASE.

404
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:38,987
WELL, I'M AFRAID
WE DON'T HAVE ANY.

405
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:40,255
( laughter )

406
00:20:40,295 --> 00:20:41,421
I'M SORRY?

407
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:42,521
WE DON'T HAVE ANY BOOKS.

408
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:43,724
WE'RE FRESH OUT OF THEM.

409
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:44,528
GOOD MORNING.

410
00:20:44,566 --> 00:20:45,294
WHAT ARE ALL THESE?

411
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:46,733
ALL WHAT?

412
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:48,532
ALL THESE... THESE...

413
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,165
YOU'RE REFERRING
TO THESE, UM... BOOKS.

414
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:53,070
YES.

415
00:20:55,744 --> 00:20:57,041
THEY'RE, UM...

416
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,068
THEY'RE ALL SOLD.

417
00:20:58,113 --> 00:20:59,137
GOOD MORNING.

418
00:20:59,181 --> 00:21:00,409
WHAT, ALL OF THEM?

419
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:01,677
EVERY SINGLE MAN JACK OF THEM.

420
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:03,116
NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM
IN AN UNSOLD STATE.

421
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:04,117
GOOD MORNING.

422
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:04,743
WHO TO?

423
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:06,118
WHAT?

424
00:21:06,155 --> 00:21:07,383
WHO ARE THEY SOLD TO?

425
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:10,221
OH, VARIOUS...

426
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:11,749
GOOD LORD,
IS THAT THE TIME?

427
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:13,955
OH, MY GOODNESS,
I MUST CLOSE FOR LUNCH.

428
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:15,361
IT'S ONLY HALF PAST TEN.

429
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:16,591
YES, WELL, I FEEL
RATHER PECKISH.

430
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:17,690
VERY PECKISH ACTUALLY.

431
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:18,927
I DON'T SUSPECT
I'LL OPEN AGAIN TODAY.

432
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:20,332
I THINK I'LL HAVE
A REALLY GOOD FEED.

433
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:21,734
I SAY! LOOK AT THAT
LOVELY BOOK SHOP

434
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,067
JUST ACROSS THE ROAD THERE.

435
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:24,766
THEY'VE GOT A MUCH BETTER
SELECTION THAN WE'VE GOT.

436
00:21:24,807 --> 00:21:26,138
PROBABLY AT RIDICULOUSLY
LOW PRICES.

437
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:27,767
JUST ACROSS THE ROAD
THERE-- GOOD MORNING.

438
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,437
BUT I WAS TOLD
TO COME HERE.

439
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,743
WELL...

440
00:21:32,781 --> 00:21:33,770
YOU WERE.

441
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:34,908
I SEE.

442
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,918
( clears throat )

443
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:39,682
I HEAR THE GOOSEBERRIES
ARE DOING WELL THIS YEAR.

444
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:42,155
AND SO ARE
THE MANGOES.

445
00:21:42,257 --> 00:21:44,157
( laughter )

446
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:45,191
I'M SORRY?

447
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:49,397
OH, I WAS JUST SAYING,
THINKING OF THE WEATHER

448
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:52,867
I HEAR THE GOOSEBERRIES
ARE DOING WELL THIS YEAR.

449
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:55,301
AND SO ARE
THE MANGOES.

450
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:56,099
MINE AREN'T.

451
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:57,469
GO ON.

452
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:58,871
WHAT?

453
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:00,033
GO ON, "MINE
AREN'T, BUT..."

454
00:22:00,075 --> 00:22:01,736
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO SAY SOMETHING

455
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:03,039
ABOUT "MINE AREN'T

456
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:05,103
BUT THE BIG CHEESE GETS
HIS AT LOW TIDE TONIGHT"?

457
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:06,112
NO.

458
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:08,980
OH... AH! GOOD MORNING.

459
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:10,109
WAIT!

460
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:11,277
WHO SENT YOU?

461
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,015
THE LITTLE OLD LADY
IN THE SWEET SHOP.

462
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:15,114
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A
DUELING SCAR JUST
HERE AND A HOOK?

463
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:16,124
NO.

464
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:17,487
NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

465
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:19,653
I WAS THINKING
OF SOMEBODY ELSE--
GOOD MORNING.

466
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:20,662
WAIT A MINUTE.

467
00:22:20,696 --> 00:22:22,129
THERE'S SOMETHING
GOING ON HERE.

468
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:23,129
WHAT? WHERE?

469
00:22:23,198 --> 00:22:24,426
YOU DIDN'T SEE
ANYTHING, DID YOU?

470
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:26,127
NO, BUT I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING GOING ON HERE.

471
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:28,066
NO, NO, WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING GOING ON HERE AT ALL.

472
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:29,661
AND HE DIDN'T SEE
ANYTHING-- GOOD MORNING.

473
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:31,036
THERE IS SOMETHING
GOING ON.

474
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:32,540
NO, THERE IS
NOTHING GOING ON.

475
00:22:32,574 --> 00:22:34,667
PLEASE BELIEVE ME,
THERE IS ABSOLU... U...

476
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,268
UTELY NOTHING
GOING ON.

477
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,608
IS THERE ANYTHING
GOING ON?

478
00:22:37,646 --> 00:22:39,546
NO, THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.

479
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:40,809
SEE? THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON.

480
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:41,816
WHO WAS THAT?

481
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,976
WELL, THAT... MY AUNT.

482
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:44,815
LOOK, WHAT WAS THIS BOOK
YOU WANTED, THEN?

483
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:45,979
QUICKLY, QUICKLY, QUICKLY.

484
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:47,318
OH, I'D LIKE TO BUY A COPY

485
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:49,517
OF AN ILLUSTRA TED HISTORY
OF FALSE TEETH.

486
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:52,286
( laughter )

487
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,887
MY GOD! YOU'VE GOT GUTS.

488
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,954
WHAT?

489
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:57,056
JUST HOW MUCH
DO YOU KNOW?

490
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:58,259
WHAT ABOUT?

491
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,790
ARE YOU FROM THE BRITISH
DENTAL ASSOCIATION?

492
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:00,802
NO, I'M A TOBACCONIST.

493
00:23:00,836 --> 00:23:01,860
GET AWAY
FROM THAT DOOR.

494
00:23:01,904 --> 00:23:03,098
I'LL JUST GO
OVER THE OTHER...

495
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:04,263
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

496
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:05,739
YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE
THIS BOOK SHOP ALIVE.

497
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:06,570
WHY NOT?

498
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:07,734
YOU KNOW TOO MUCH

499
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,868
MY DENTAL FRIEND.

500
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:09,878
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

501
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:10,970
COME CLEAN.

502
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:12,071
YOU'RE A DENTIST,
AREN'T YOU?

503
00:23:12,114 --> 00:23:13,547
NO, I'M A TOBACCONIST.

504
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:15,880
A TOBACCONIST WHO JUST HAPPENS

505
00:23:15,918 --> 00:23:18,409
TO BE BUYING A BOOK ON... TEETH?

506
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:19,078
YES.

507
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:20,486
HA! HA! HA!

508
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:22,319
DROP THAT GUN,
STAPLETON!

509
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:23,483
LaFARGE!

510
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:25,493
THERE IS SOMETHING
GOING ON.

511
00:23:25,527 --> 00:23:26,494
NO, THERE ISN'T.

512
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:28,120
OKAY, STAPLETON,
THIS IS IT.

513
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:30,256
WHERE'S MAHONEY HIDDEN
THE FILLINGS?

514
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:31,732
UM... WHAT FILLINGS?

515
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:33,735
YOU KNOW WHICH
FILLINGS, STAPLETON.

516
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,134
UPPER RIGHT,
TWO AND FOUR

517
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:37,330
LOWER RIGHT, THREE
AND LOWER LEFT, ONE.

518
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:38,498
COME ON.

519
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,098
REMEMBER WHAT
HAPPENED TO NIGEL.

520
00:23:40,142 --> 00:23:41,370
WHAT HAPPENED
TO NIGEL?

521
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,674
ORTHODONTIC JAKE GAVE HIM
A GELIGNITE MOUTHWASH.

522
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:45,407
I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING GOING ON.

523
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:46,573
BUT THERE ISN'T.

524
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:48,105
COME ON, STAPLETON.

525
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,515
THE FILLINGS.

526
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,678
THEY'RE AT
22 WIMPOLE STREET.

527
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,518
DON'T PLAY GAMES
WITH ME.

528
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,683
OW!

529
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:57,851
22A WIMPOLE STREET.

530
00:23:57,893 --> 00:23:58,985
THAT'S BETTER.

531
00:23:59,027 --> 00:24:00,858
BUT YOU'LL NEED
AN APPOINTMENT.

532
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:04,059
OKAY, BRIAN, MAKE
WITH THE APPOINTMENT,
BABY, NO GAS.

533
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:06,863
AH, NOT SO FAST,
LaFARGE.

534
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:08,369
LaFarge:
VAN DER BERG.

535
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:09,927
YES-- NOW,
DROP THE ROSCOE.

536
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:11,234
THERE IS SOMETHING
GOING ON.

537
00:24:11,273 --> 00:24:12,205
NO, THERE ISN'T.

538
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,868
NURSE,
GET THE GUNS.

539
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,002
WHO'S THAT?

540
00:24:16,044 --> 00:24:17,375
THAT'S VAN DER BERG--
HE'S ON OUR SIDE.

541
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:20,438
ALL RIGHT, GET UP
AGAINST THE WALL, LaFARGE.

542
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:22,109
AND YOU, TOO, STAPLETON.

543
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,208
ME?

544
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:24,377
YES!

545
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:26,114
YOU DIRTY,
DOUBLE-CROSSING RAT.

546
00:24:26,154 --> 00:24:26,882
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

547
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:27,752
HE'S TWO-TIMED ME.

548
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:28,778
BAD LUCK.

549
00:24:28,824 --> 00:24:32,726
ALL RIGHT, WHERE ARE
THE FILLINGS?

550
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:34,058
( breathing heavily )

551
00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:35,063
ANSWER ME.

552
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:36,291
WHERE ARE THEY?!

553
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:38,060
THIS IS QUITE
EXCITING.

554
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,330
NOT SO FAST.

555
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:41,700
ALL:
BRIAN!

556
00:24:41,737 --> 00:24:42,999
OOH, WHAT'S THAT?

557
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:44,835
ALL:
IT'S A BAZOOKA!

558
00:24:44,873 --> 00:24:47,774
ALL RIGHT, GET
AGAINST THE WALL,
VAN DER BERG

559
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:49,333
AND YOU, NURSE.

560
00:24:49,378 --> 00:24:51,608
AND THE FIRST ONE
TO TRY ANYTHING

561
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:54,946
MOVES TO A PRACTICE
SIX FEET UNDERGROUND.

562
00:24:54,983 --> 00:24:58,248
THIS IS AN ANTITANK GUN,
AND IT'S LOADED

563
00:24:58,286 --> 00:25:01,744
AND YOU'VE JUST GOT
FIVE SECONDS TO TELL ME

564
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,384
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE.

565
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:05,984
ALL:
WHAT?

566
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:08,496
OH, I'M SORRY,
MY MIND'S WANDERING.

567
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,294
I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE DAY,
I REALLY HAVE.

568
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,166
YOU'VE GOT FIVE SECONDS
TO TELL ME...

569
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:16,465
I'VE FORGOTTEN.

570
00:25:16,505 --> 00:25:19,338
THE FIVE SECONDS HAVEN'T
STARTED YET, HAVE THEY?

571
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:21,103
ONLY WE DON'T KNOW
THE QUESTION.

572
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:22,471
WAS IT ABOUT VOGLER?

573
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:26,311
NO, NO, YOU'VE GOT FIVE SECONDS
TO TELL ME...

574
00:25:26,348 --> 00:25:27,406
ABOUT NIGEL?

575
00:25:27,449 --> 00:25:28,040
NO, NO.

576
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,414
BRONSKY?

577
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:30,008
NO, NO.

578
00:25:30,052 --> 00:25:31,019
THE FILLINGS?

579
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:32,953
OH, YES, THE FILLINGS,
OF COURSE.

580
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:34,979
HOW STUPID
OF ME.

581
00:25:35,023 --> 00:25:37,958
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'VE GOT FIVE SECONDS.

582
00:25:37,993 --> 00:25:39,984
WHERE ARE THE FILLINGS?

583
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:40,926
FIVE...

584
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,019
FOUR...

585
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:45,021
THREE...

586
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:46,790
TWO...

587
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:48,591
ONE...

588
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:51,301
ZERO.

589
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:56,003
ZERO.

590
00:25:56,044 --> 00:25:58,342
OH, I'VE FORGOTTEN
TO FIRE IT.

591
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,507
SORRY, SILLY DAY.

592
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:02,039
FIVE, FOUR, THREE

593
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:04,348
TWO, ONE.

594
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:07,184
DROP THE BAZOOKA,
BRIAN.

595
00:26:07,222 --> 00:26:08,348
( laughter )

596
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,948
ALL:
THE BIG CHEESE!

597
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:14,519
I'M GLAD YOU COULD ALL COME
TO MY LITTLE PARTY.

598
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:17,691
AND FLOPSY'S GLAD, TOO.

599
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:20,201
AREN'T YOU, FLOPSY?

600
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:22,226
AREN'T YOU, FLOPSY?!

601
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:29,369
THAT'LL TEACH YOU TO PLAY
HARD TO GET.

602
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:34,212
THERE, POOR FLOPSY'S DEAD
AND NEVER CALLED ME "MOTHER"

603
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:36,547
AND SOON YOU WILL ALL BE DEAD.

604
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:37,916
DEAD, DEAD.

605
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:40,080
( all hissing )

606
00:26:40,122 --> 00:26:42,989
AND BECAUSE I'M SO EVIL

607
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:48,724
YOU WILL ALL DIE THE SLOW WAY--
UNDER THE DRILL.

608
00:26:48,764 --> 00:26:50,129
IT'S 1:00.

609
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:51,221
SO IT IS.

610
00:26:51,266 --> 00:26:52,563
LUNCH BREAK, EVERYONE.

611
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:53,727
BACK HERE AT 2:00.

612
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,699
HELLO?

613
00:26:56,738 --> 00:26:58,638
GIVE ME THE BRITISH
DENTAL ASSOCIATION

614
00:26:58,673 --> 00:26:59,935
AND FAST.

615
00:26:59,975 --> 00:27:02,671
YOU SEE, I KNEW
THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON.

616
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:05,373
OF COURSE, THE BIG CHEESE MADE
TWO MISTAKES.

617
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:07,813
FIRST OF ALL, HE DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE ME, LEMMING

618
00:27:07,849 --> 00:27:09,339
ARTHUR LEMMING

619
00:27:09,384 --> 00:27:12,046
SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR,
BRITISH DENTAL ASSOCIATION.

620
00:27:12,087 --> 00:27:14,055
AND SECOND-- SPIT--

621
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:15,852
BY THE TIME I GOT BACK
FROM LUNCH

622
00:27:15,891 --> 00:27:18,951
I HAD EVERY DENTAL SURGEON
IN SW-I WAITING FOR THEM ALL

623
00:27:18,994 --> 00:27:20,222
IN THE BROOM CUPBOARD.

624
00:27:20,262 --> 00:27:21,627
FUNNY, ISN'T IT

625
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:24,860
HOW NAUGHTY DENTISTS ALWAYS MAKE
THAT ONE FATAL MISTAKE?

626
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,026
BYE FOR NOW.

627
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,329
KEEP YOUR TEETH CLEAN.

628
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:29,735
Chorus:

629
00:27:42,717 --> 00:27:44,116
RIGHT, NO, I WARNED YOU.

630
00:27:44,219 --> 00:27:46,244
NO, I WARNED YOU
ABOUT THE SLOGAN.

631
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:47,653
RIGHT, THAT'S THE END.

632
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:48,951
STOP THE PROGRAM.

633
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,514
STOP IT.

634
00:28:01,903 --> 00:28:03,894
( sighs )
