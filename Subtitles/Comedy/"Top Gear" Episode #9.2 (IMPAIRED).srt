3
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:11,710
Tonight

4
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,597
Hugh Grant stars in our reasonably-priced car

5
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:18,192
and is the new Audi TT any good?

6
00:00:18,302 --> 00:00:20,833
We find out by playing golf.

7
00:00:31,496 --> 00:00:33,062
Hello and welcome!

8
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:34,417
Thank you for that!

9
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:36,965
Thank you.

10
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,369
Now

11
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:41,149
Now as I'm sure you know...

12
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,384
As I'm sure you know,

13
00:00:43,392 --> 00:00:47,659
James May is the slowest man in the entire world

14
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:50,300
By the time he sets off anywhere normally his

15
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:52,131
hair has grown another inch.

16
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:53,997
So, plainly,

17
00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:57,434
He was the ideal man to try and max

18
00:00:57,552 --> 00:01:00,653
the fastest car in the world.

19
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:08,597
"Vlad the impaler" is back.

20
00:01:14,337 --> 00:01:16,394
Last year, the mighty Bugatti Veyron

21
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:19,213
starred in our greatest Top Gear Challenge ever

22
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:22,865
when it raced an air-plane across the continent.

23
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:29,088
In that film, Jeremy talked endlessly about

24
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:33,168
the Veyron's ferocious power, and its incredible top speed.

25
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:35,842
But because he was on public road

26
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:38,085
he had to stick to the speed limit.

27
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:39,059
Hahahaha..

28
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:45,901
But today, we're not going to talk about it.

29
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,075
We are going to do it.

30
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,990
We're going to take the fastest production car in the world

31
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:51,460
up to its top speed.

32
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,531
That top speed is 253 mph.

33
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:02,395
Much faster than a formular 1 car.

34
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:09,556
and when you think that the Veyron has

35
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:12,502
air-bags, air-conditioning, a stereo, a boot

36
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:15,185
and all the other stuff F1 cars aren't burdened with

37
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:18,513
You realize what an increadible machine this is!

38
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:24,898
The Veyron is about pushing the outside of the envelope

39
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:28,707
It's about doing things that people said just were not possible

40
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:31,684
This car is a sort of "Concord" moment.

41
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:37,771
Getting cars to do 155 mph frankly isn't really very difficult.

42
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:43,691
the Veyron needs just a piffling 270 bhp to reach that speed.

43
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:46,349
But 253!

44
00:02:47,073 --> 00:02:47,666
Crikey!

45
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:50,552
the faster you go,

46
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:53,568
the more Mother Nature tries to hold you back

47
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,798
So to do the next 100 mph

48
00:02:56,806 --> 00:02:59,486
the 100 mhp that takes you up to 250

49
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:04,034
needs another 730 Bhp.

50
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:08,014
So what you end up with

51
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:11,959
is a 16-cylinder engine with 4 turbo chargers

52
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:15,606
producing 1001 horse power.

53
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:18,918
and a lot of heat.

54
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:22,443
That's why your car has 1 radiator

55
00:03:22,443 --> 00:03:24,364
and this car has 10.

56
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:30,599
The engineers really worried
uncharted territory in this car.

57
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,121
Here is an example, when they wanted to sort out the high speed dynamics

58
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:36,703
They went to the Sauber F1 Team and they said

59
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,845
"Do you mind awfully if we use your wind tunnel?"

60
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:39,861
and they said

61
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:43,099
"Terribly sorry, but we don't go up to those speeds"

62
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:47,525
In fact, cracking 253 mph

63
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,760
cause nighimare after nightmaire.

64
00:03:50,014 --> 00:03:55,184
But Bugatti insist that this 850,000 pound car can do it.

65
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:02,695
Mind you, actually testing their bold claim is a bit of a palaver.

66
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:07,250
This is Ehra-Lessien

67
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:10,888
Volkswagon's maximum security test track in Germany

68
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:13,597
When it was built during the cold war

69
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:17,805
It was delibrately sited in a no fly zone
near the east German border

70
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:24,467
in order to stop prying eyes from seeing secret prototypes

71
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:30,526
It has over 16 miles of private track.

72
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,375
But the bit we are interested in is the main straight,

73
00:04:33,578 --> 00:04:36,666
which is a whopping 5.5 miles long.

74
00:04:38,664 --> 00:04:41,405
Although it is technically a flat and level road.

75
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:44,873
You stand here, you can't actually see the other end

76
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,375
and that's because it's following the curvature of the earth.

77
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,651
But even when you've sorted the venue

78
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,326
you can't just jump in the car and go.

79
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:02,437
This is Germany, there are procedures to go through.

80
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:04,660
I like procedures

81
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:11,321
You have to insert a special key into a slot by the door.

82
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,659
And when you do, the diffuser flaps close.

83
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:18,030
the rear spoiler retracts

84
00:05:18,557 --> 00:05:22,392
and the whole car hunkers down to became as slippery as possible

85
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:32,115
The telemetry box we're using to record the speed

86
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,662
measures in kilometers an hours.

87
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:37,810
So the magic number we are looking for is 407

88
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,223
Right ladies and gentleman

89
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:42,906
Here we go. I'm approaching the
banking on the top of the circuit

90
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:45,133
I have to do this in 200 kph

91
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,468
That's about 120

92
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:47,644
Round the banking

93
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:49,415
look for my acceleration point

94
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:52,014
then give it the beans down the straight

95
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:02,557
200 kph, that's 120

96
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:07,947
To get the car settled fourth gear 5000 revs

97
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,107
Looking for the exit where I bury it.

98
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:21,241
Here we go!

99
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,392
The climb from 200 to 300 kph

100
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:30,363
was over in just 9.4 seconds

101
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:34,466
The world, viewers, is a total blur!

102
00:06:36,633 --> 00:06:38,684
I'm already doing 330 Kph

103
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:40,401
Going too quick, I can't do the math.

104
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,901
Gettng up to about 350

105
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,589
Captain Slow is doing 360 kph... 370

106
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,349
That's 230 miles per hour.

107
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:57,915
I was now leaving F1 cars behind

108
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,488
It's no wonder Micheal Schumacher retired.

109
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,582
He's slower than me!

110
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,312
At this sort of speed

111
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:09,639
this engine is sucking in as much air in a minute

112
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,153
as I breathe in four days

113
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:15,967
Getting close to the maximum

114
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,320
which means the tires would only last for about 15 minutes

115
00:07:19,987 --> 00:07:20,817
But it's OK

116
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:24,297
Because the fuel runs out in 12 minutes

117
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:30,590
This is a road car and I'm getting up to 404

118
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,290
405, come on!

119
00:07:35,443 --> 00:07:37,084
Come on give me one more!

120
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:42,073
406!

121
00:07:42,073 --> 00:07:44,752
Come on I need one more, one more!

122
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:06,751
I'm covering a football pitch every second

123
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,643
That...

124
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:26,361
I'm pretty confident

125
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:29,324
that's as fast as I'm ever gonna go in a car.

126
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:32,333
Increadible

127
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,060
That is ...

128
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,887
it's made my eyes water.

129
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,379
I am impressed, James

130
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:54,021
OK.

131
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:57,052
thing is though, OK.

132
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:58,415
You know when you take

133
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:02,483
a Ferrari or a Lamborghini or particularly a Koenigzegg to its top speed...

134
00:09:02,483 --> 00:09:04,414
- No.
- No, actually you wouldn't

135
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:05,904
But anyway, when you do

136
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:07,276
They fizz they buzz

137
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:09,584
They feels like all the body panels are peeling away

138
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:13,620
'cause you're right on the edge of what's physically and technically possible.

139
00:09:13,984 --> 00:09:15,397
Really? I didn't get any of that with this..

140
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:17,439
To be honest, the only thing I've got was at the end of the straight

141
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:20,589
I had to touch the breaks, so you see the spoiler come up slowing down.

142
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:21,538
You got a sort of ...

143
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:23,508
And that's it?

144
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:24,226
Yeah, just...

145
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:26,410
So it's kind of safe and relaxing

146
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:29,044
even at 250 miles an hour

147
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,119
Absolutely, yeah.

148
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,778
It's... totally undramatic.

149
00:09:31,785 --> 00:09:33,195
But I would give you a bit of warning

150
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:36,007
which is a bit disorientating doing that sort of speed.

151
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:37,905
'Cause, after I come off the banking

152
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:39,209
I was slowing down to stop

153
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:41,479
You know how you get a bit impatient, you think "I'll just open the door"

154
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,725
Fortunately I looked back at the speedo and I was still doing 70

155
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:47,796
Umm..OK, so.

156
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:50,996
We've established that this is faster across Europe than

157
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,236
- your light ari-craft
- Yepp.

158
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:56,639
We've established that it realy will do 250 mph

159
00:09:56,749 --> 00:10:00,976
But we've never been able to find out
how fast it'll go round our track

160
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:04,212
Now the problem is Bugatti are
happy for us to have one here.

161
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:05,963
They are happy for you to go and do that.

162
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:07,486
But they won't lend the Stig one.

163
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:09,682
Umm..So really, this is an appeal.

164
00:10:09,682 --> 00:10:11,155
If you've got a Veyron

165
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:14,544
and you'd like to lend it to us.

166
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:17,647
We're prepared to pay anything up to 30 pounds

167
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
And now the news

168
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,320
and we start off with the Porsche Cayenne because

169
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,620
they've revised it and come out with a new one

170
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,970
It's got new prices, new bits and pieces, new engines,

171
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,120
But the most important thing of course about a Cayenne is

172
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,650
it's never been the best-looking car, is it?

173
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,170
No, not even slightly.

174
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,350
Well, we can only assume that this new one

175
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,500
still isn't exactly the best-looking car

176
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,020
because well, here is the official photograph
that Porsche sent out for us.

177
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,600
I can hear the discussion of the
photographer had actually with the director.

178
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,050
He said "Is the light good for you?"
and he said "No, there is still is some."

179
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,400
Yes, exactly.

180
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,900
Now, hey, you know that young Russian business kid

181
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,800
who bought TVR a couple of years ago?

182
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,200
Yeah.

183
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,570
Yeah, we've got a picture of him here at a business meeting

184
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,650
- Oh, yeah, there he is
- There

185
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,020
Did he close down the factory in Blackpool and make everyone redundant.

186
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,850
Exactly, well, it turns out that all the TVR owners have decided

187
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,470
that they're gonna throw a party for the
workers who've all been made redundant.

188
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,570
The party dubbed fundable

189
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,600
will include a buffet dinner,

190
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,520
How much do I don't want to go to that?

191
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,770
Err, bar disco and live band.

192
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,270
Wahl, a TVR band.

193
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,770
So they'll play presumably really loud really fast

194
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,320
and then burst into flames.

195
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,600
Here's some news, you know the hot
Renault Clio, there was a really fast one

196
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,950
They've done a even hotter one, OK?

197
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,270
It's call the R27

198
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,600
It's got a lower stiffer chassis.

199
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,720
We've got a photograph of it here, OK?

200
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,750
Now, these are the four Renault formula 1 racing drivers, OK,

201
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,820
for this year.

202
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,370
Now this chap, OK, the new one,

203
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,550
He really likes this car,

204
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,750
he is very excited by it.

205
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,450
He is very, very excited...

206
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,620
He is very pleased to see it, isn't he?

207
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,200
Really pleased.

208
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,470
What I love as well,

209
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,170
If you look around the other guys,
who clearly spotted the problem.

210
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,570
Well, you could hardly miss it, could you.

211
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,100
They're all very embarrassed. Don't look

212
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,970
Well, you see this, Ok, I got this
photograph from a French website.

213
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,820
The actually official photograph
that was sent to it by Renault

214
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,070
Let me show it to you.

215
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,900
Look, there's he, go and stand behind the car now.

216
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,750
- Look how embarrassing he is.
- But they are all racing drivers.

217
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,050
Couldn't they've lent a crash helmet
to hold it in the appropriate way.

218
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,800
It was his crash helmet that caused
the problem in the first place.

219
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,700
Leave it...

220
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,920
Err, oh, now

221
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,650
News from the director of public prosecutions

222
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,970
who I discovered in the paper this week

223
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,050
he is called Can or something rather

224
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,270
Not called Can.

225
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,970
Can is the name of a man you borrow a step ladder from

226
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,400
Yeah.

227
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,220
Not the director of public prosecutions.

228
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,150
Can has announced that there is a
whole raft of new motoring offences

229
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,400
for which you can go to prison, OK?

230
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,950
One of them is,

231
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,150
retuning your radio.

232
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,150
- Oh, don't, it's stupid. - What?

233
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,020
Seriously

234
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,800
But what if the Archers comes on?

235
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,600
I can't listen to an episode of the Archers in the car

236
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,420
without losing my temper and having
a crash deliberately to end it?

237
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,020
Can has decided

238
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,720
that we'll have to tolerate these things,

239
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,300
cause you're not allowed to retune a radio,

240
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,650
you're also not allowed to put lipstick on.

241
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,450
Again, what...

242
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,050
But get this one. You are not
allowed now to be an undertaker.

243
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,720
What? I don't got it, an undertaker?

244
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,200
You an undertaker?

245
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
You're undertaker? You're going to prison.

246
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,600
Can says, Can says if you "undertake" someone,

247
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,300
Oh, hang on.

248
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,020
Well, it's... I've always had been a bit of beef about this.

249
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,270
because I reckon if you go pass someone on the inside,

250
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,350
There was room to do that,

251
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,050
there was room for them to have got
out of the way in the first place.

252
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,114
It's wrong!

253
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:57,350
They are the ones who should be prosecuted.

254
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,100
They can't find prisons to put pedophiles in.

255
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,400
But they're going to be putting
him in it for being an undertaker.

256
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,770
It's ridiculous.

257
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,920
You know actually they can't find the pedophiles

258
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,070
cause 300 have got missing.

259
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,650
I know where they are.

260
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,770
If you drive down the outside lane of the motorway

261
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,820
now, not retune the radio at 50 miles an hour, OK?

262
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,450
You are immune from prosecution, OK?

263
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,070
So it's the ideal place to go if
you're being looked for by the law.

264
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:26,120
So therefore anyone doing 50 in
the outside lane of the motorway

265
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,900
is a child molester.

266
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,750
Wahl, that's amazing.

267
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,300
You use logic, there. That's incredible.

268
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,850
Argue with that.

269
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,370
Hey, now, can I just say, OK

270
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,900
it's been a while since we sat here as a group as you know,

271
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,200
so I thought it would be a good idea

272
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,020
just to count through a few of the good cars and
bad cars we've driven when we've been off air

273
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,050
and I have to say, good cars for me, Lexus.

274
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,170
particularly, actually, the GS, the one in the middle

275
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm with you.

276
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,300
The hybrid one, mate

277
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,920
No, no, this one, OK?

278
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,650
This looks like a normal car.

279
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,750
The great thing is, OK,

280
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,420
its batteries will only take you less than a mile

281
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,170
which means most of the time you are on the V6, you know,

282
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,620
you chewing fuel, you warming the world,

283
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,070
and everybody is happy, OK?

284
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,920
It's very quiet, it's very fast,

285
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,500
it's very very comfortable.

286
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,070
And of course you can drive it to London,

287
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,150
do U turns on Piccadilly all day long

288
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,020
can't Livingston cop charge you a penny.

289
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,170
- Brilliant car there. - It is a hybrid.

290
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,100
It's a properly brilliant car there.

291
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,070
I'm gonna put like a little 9 volt battery in a Hummer.

292
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,570
It's a hybrid.

293
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,170
I was very impressed if I maybe buy the Suzuki Swift Sport.

294
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,220
- I am. - No, it's...

295
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,350
This is the most underrated

296
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,700
It's not going over well mate, it's not going over well.

297
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,570
Before you all chime in, it's a small car, but,

298
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,300
you know I'm not a big fan of the new Mini

299
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,820
I've just... It's too big and lump and all the rest of it

300
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,100
That I think is the new Mini.

301
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,550
Try it, you'll be amazed. It's brilliant that car.

302
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,550
That's an order from him.

303
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,320
Actually, to be honest, I quite like that as well.

304
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,420
I, I... actually really did the Volvo C30.

305
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,470
I know, don't think I gone mad.

306
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,870
But it's a good looking car.

307
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,270
And you can get it with a 5 cylinder engine

308
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,770
which is exactly the same one
as in the Focus ST, the hot one.

309
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,350
Worst cars, no question for me.

310
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,850
One of the top 5 worst cars I've ever driven. VW Golf GT.

311
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,670
There.

312
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,470
No, seriously, it's got a supercharged
and turbocharged engine,

313
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,270
which is as smooth as falling down
stairs while wearing leg calipers.

314
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,800
Basically if you tend to buy one of those, honestly,
just work harder and buy the Golf GTI.

315
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,770
- There is a Top Gear top tip.
- Good advice.

316
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,150
I was pretty disappointed, I hate I have to say

317
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,850
this a Bentley Arnage T, not the R

318
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,100
which is brilliant.

319
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,320
This is a useful consumer advice for people in the north.

320
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,170
Well actually it is.

321
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,300
And I'm sorry it is.

322
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,650
Because the T has a bit more power and a bit more torque

323
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,970
and it's just enough to spoil it.

324
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,320
If you stick with the R, which is the beautiful car,

325
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,670
they cost 12,000 pounds less so you can buy a house.

326
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,550
For me, it was the Subaru Tribeca

327
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,850
which is a MPV and technically it's not bad

328
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,150
but it's hideous and it's a family car.

329
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,170
So my kids would too terrify to get in it.

330
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,600
Hating it. it's not... it's just... it's hideous.

331
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,220
Hey, now, Jaguar have made a concept car.

332
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,500
Well, not another one.

333
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,950
It's why they never make any money, isn't it?

334
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,620
because they just keep making concept cars all the time

335
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,650
instead of just making cars that you can buy.

336
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,100
Well I know, they haven't understood
that if you sell a car, you get money.

337
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,920
Yeah.

338
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,450
Anyway, this one, OK?

339
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,200
They say, which I've got a picture of it here.

340
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,020
OK? They say, that's going to be the next S type.

341
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,920
It will be looking exactly the same as that.

342
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,220
Well, if that's true, that's fantastic news.

343
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,170
It looks brilliant.

344
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,020
I know. It does. I went to see it in the flesh the other day.

345
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,300
The designer was there and he said

346
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,250
"I assure you, the S type will look exactly like that."

347
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,770
If that car comes out like that,

348
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,070
I'll cut my left leg off,

349
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,900
beat myself to death with it.

350
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,270
- Really?
- Yeah.

351
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:42,970
Do it.

352
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,320
Make it, just make it.

353
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,300
Now, if you're looking to spend between

354
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,570
20,000 and 25,000 pounds on a coupe,

355
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,650
your choice just became a lot more complicated.

356
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,650
So, to see if we could help you out,

357
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,500
the three of us have been to Scotland for a row.

358
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,700
These are of the cars that have caused the problem.

359
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,700
There is the new Audi TT,

360
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,450
the new Alfa Romeo Brera,

361
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:21,150
and the not so new, but still quite interesting Mazda RX-8

362
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,620
So, let's start with the Audi.

363
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,100
Now I want to make it absolutely plain that

364
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,170
I did not like the old TT.

365
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,870
Because all they did to make it
was put a Golf in a pretty front.

366
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,220
That's like putting a cow in a track suit.

367
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,900
Still not gonna win any running races.

368
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,400
With this new one though, they really have gone to towns.

369
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,400
It's longer, wider and more aggressive than the old model.

370
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,900
And even though this is the baby of the range,

371
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,870
it's more technical as well.

372
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,450
Take the body for example,

373
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,200
from here back, it's steel,

374
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,920
from here forwards, it's aluminum.

375
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,570
And that not only makes the car lighter,

376
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,120
it's actually 9 stone less than the old TT,

377
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,600
it also improves weight distribution.

378
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,370
Then there is the suspension,

379
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,420
the fluid in the shock absorber has got iron filings in it,

380
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,570
then round the outside there is a magnet,

381
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,970
turn the magnet on, your iron filings move about,

382
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,220
everything becomes firmer.

383
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,900
And how much do you not want to go on a holiday

384
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,220
with a man who thought of that.

385
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:38,120
The upshot is, this is no longer a cow in a track suit.

386
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,520
It's a cow GTI in racing overall.

387
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,620
The steering in the old car was numb,

388
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,670
in this, it feels connected.

389
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,400
The ride in the old car was as comfortable
as falling down a flight of stairs,

390
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,200
in this, it's smooth when the iron filings are dormant

391
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,400
and then when you push the switch to turn the magnets on

392
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,050
it becomes racing car sharp.

393
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,450
This is not a car for taking your
hair to the hair dresses any more,

394
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,900
this is a car for making your hair stand on end

395
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,128
it's a proper sports car.

396
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,800
Rubbish!

397
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,050
What you want is one of these.

398
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,870
This is the new Alfa Romeo Brera.

399
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,020
It's a brilliant car.

400
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,750
On the face of it, the Alfa is exactly like the TT.

401
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,620
They are both four-seat coupes,

402
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,320
they've both got four-cylinder engines,

403
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,370
they've both got six-speed gearboxes,

404
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,270
they both cost around 24,000 pounds,

405
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:07,600
and they'll both also be available with
3.2 Liter V6 engines and four-wheel drive.

406
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,170
But actually, this is not like a TT at all.

407
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,600
Now we've said this time and again on Top Gear

408
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,700
You can not consider yourself a true petrolhead

409
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,100
until you've owned an Alfa Romeo.

410
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,070
They're not cars for posers,

411
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,970
they're cars for connoisseurs.

412
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,970
there're some times, they'll infuriate you

413
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,700
other times, they're really gonna thrill and excite you,

414
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,200
but the point is: they're never, ever boring.

415
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,820
It was not designed like the Audi,

416
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,150
using just science and technology and iron filings,

417
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,300
It also has soul and passion.

418
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,070
This car has a heart.

419
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,620
But you know what really swings it for me?

420
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,400
It's the interior.

421
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,100
Sitting in here feels like you're sitting
in a Milanese's espresso bar.

422
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:11,320
Sitting in the Audi feels like you're
trapped in a Berlin post office.

423
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
OK, then, James,

424
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,920
have you told the ladies and gentlemen
how fast the Brera goes from 0-60

425
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,420
No, I haven't and I was rather
hoping you wouldn't bring it up.

426
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,820
But never mind, ladies and gentlemen,

427
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,850
it does it in 8.1 seconds.

428
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,220
Which in 1976 would have been considered pretty brisk.

429
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,370
James, you could be out dragged but a canoe boat.

430
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,520
It's not a slow car,

431
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,670
it's just not quite as quick as your car.

432
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,470
which is a car for people who use moisturizing products.

433
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,470
James, I'm with you.

434
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,100
I prefer an Alfa to an Audi.

435
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,020
But not that Alfa Romeo,

436
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,550
that's too slow and that's an end of it.

437
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,400
It's not too slow, it's plenty fast enough...

438
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,320
James, our colleague has arrived.

439
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,450
Here he is

440
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,400
Lord Woolworth is here.

441
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,400
If it's power you want, then this is your answer.

442
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,170
The wankel engined Mazda RX-8.

443
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,420
When it comes to speed,

444
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,420
it will do 0-60 in 6.4 seconds,

445
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,920
That's a bit faster than the Audi and
a whole lot faster than the Alfa.

446
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,500
Top speed, 'round 150.

447
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,120
Put it on a track,

448
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,570
and you quickly realize what this car is all about.

449
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,250
About this engine, it is different, it's a rotary.

450
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,420
So you use it differently.

451
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,150
All the power is at the top end.

452
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,900
So you can crush it mercilessly,

453
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,300
an it will thank you for it.

454
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,900
There is something else too.

455
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,400
The Alfa is basically just an Alfa saloon underneath,

456
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,950
And the Audi is just an Golf in a fancy front.

457
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,120
The RX-8, however, is bespoke.

458
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,720
It was designed from the ground up
to be a preliminary sports car.

459
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,420
This is the only one with rear wheel drive.

460
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,420
It is a proper blue-blooded driver's car.

461
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,270
Listen to that, 7, 8 ,9

462
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,070
And yet despite all that,

463
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,250
it has four doors.

464
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:29,220
You see, you got your big door
at the front, usual sort of thing,

465
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,950
then you got the little door for back seat passengers.

466
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,470
Look at that.

467
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,220
It's brilliant.

468
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,650
There're a few disadvantages I admit.

469
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,850
You'll struggle to get more than 23 MPG,

470
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,350
it uses quite a lot of oil,

471
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,620
and the depreciation is a bit steep.

472
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:59,320
But then a RX-8 is 2,000 pounds
cheaper to buy than the others,

473
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,450
and 2000 times better.

474
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,350
And I don't care what those other idiots say.

475
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,800
A tricky decision then,

476
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,520
three similar cars, but three different opinions.

477
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,400
To see if we could find a winner,

478
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,850
the three of us needed to meet up.

479
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:23,770
So this being Scotland, the home of golf.

480
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,450
We decided to break out the Pringle.

481
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,700
What will you be using here?

482
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,000
How the hell do I know?

483
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,650
I've never ever played golf.

484
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,550
And it's like that, isn't it?

485
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,470
I can't believe you.

486
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,320
You seem to look like somebody who've done it...

487
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,200
Hahaha...

488
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,250
You've got dressed up in that outfit to do that.

489
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,900
To be honest, I could've carried it that far.

490
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,620
That doesn't look right.

491
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,570
How could it not look right?

492
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,350
Shut up, watch and learn.

493
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,450
- Wow! - It's gone in the sea.

494
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,000
- It's gone in the sea.
- Yeah.

495
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
I will tell you what, Richard,

496
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,250
Your Mazda would look good here.

497
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,470
Get off, it is not a golfist's car.

498
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,870
- It is actually. - That actually is.

499
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,820
I'm fairly confident you won't see
an Alfa Romeo in the car park.

500
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,450
No, we won't.

501
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,820
But I'm afraid I could see your car as well.

502
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,420
- TT? - Yeah.

503
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,300
TT is the car for the kind of man who

504
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,450
matches his belt to the little tag on these trousers

505
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,520
and he is then proud and pleased with that.

506
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,900
- What do they do and got they could do this, don't they?

507
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,270
He's gonna do it again.

508
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,100
- It's like his pre-fly checks
- I'll kill him, I'm going to kill him.

509
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,100
That's quite...

510
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,400
Well it wasn't bad.

511
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,020
Well, it was.

512
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,670
I just got a hole in 21.

513
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,020
We were extremely quick at getting to a new hole.

514
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,020
Oh

515
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,750
- Oh, no...
- Hahaha

516
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,220
Oh, well done.

517
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,800
But every time we got there...

518
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,470
Yes! Hahaha

519
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,050
... things slowed down again.

520
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,020
Are you using an ace?

521
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,920
Partly because we were useless

522
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,420
and partly because we kept arguing about our cars.

523
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,750
That Mazda is chintzy, it's nearly as chintzy as...

524
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,150
Chintzy? I'm sorry, I just...

525
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,550
Both of your cars are pompous...

526
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,470
Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish...

527
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,070
OK how long you wanna me keep saying rubbish?

528
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,400
This annoyed the proper men of Pringle
who were queuing up behind us.

529
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,020
There is no Roush leather in the Audi, there is no...

530
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,420
Well, practically, it might as well be Roush.

531
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,620
There're people behind us, they're very angry...

532
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,320
I know there're people waiting on

533
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,170
I'm trying just to get on with it, yeah, I know.

534
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,100
Nope.

535
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,570
After an hour we reached the third hole

536
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,270
and were still arguing.

537
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,550
You are completely wrong about the Mazda.

538
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,700
Technically it may be good

539
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,920
it may be fantastic on the track,

540
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,350
but it's not what's it about on the road.

541
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,500
It's too jigly,

542
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,000
- it's too harsh the interior,
- Jigly?

543
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,500
Just because the Alfa is slightly slower,

544
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,520
- You think it must be able to...
- It's not slightly slower, James.

545
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,600
It's a little bit slower in the real world

546
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,820
but in terms of being of the way it feels to drive,

547
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,520
the balance, the feel of the steering,

548
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,750
the ride, the little niggles you get in... it hasn't got a

549
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,700
How far can I hit his head?

550
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,550
... fundament like yours have

551
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,600
That's just childish and doesn't solve the argument.

552
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,070
After this, we were asked to leave.

553
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,470
And all we've managed to agree on is

554
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,620
that the Alfa was the least golf clubish.

555
00:28:13,369 --> 00:28:14,818
Thank you, thank you

556
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,182
obviously we will pick that up later on.

557
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:21,932
but now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

558
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,174
My guest tonight is a global megastar

559
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:26,564
really, he's made his name playing

560
00:28:26,564 --> 00:28:29,137
that kind of dithering English man we all know in love

561
00:28:29,146 --> 00:28:30,851
so I guess it's only a matter of time... uh...

562
00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:34,043
before he's asked to play the lead in "James May: the movie".

563
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,250
Please welcome to this poky motoring show,

564
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:39,579
Hugh Grant!

565
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:44,679
- How're you doing
- Hi, good to see you. Very well.

566
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:46,993
have a seat. Uh... Have a seat.

567
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:52,225
And um... grateful you've come.

568
00:28:53,554 --> 00:28:54,510
I got to say:

569
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:56,551
this is thrill for me.

570
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:57,944
It's a thrill for me.

571
00:28:57,952 --> 00:28:58,640
No, but it really is,

572
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:00,418
because for the first time ever in the guest interview

573
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:02,788
- we've got girls all around the front.
- Ah... yes.

574
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:05,164
'Cause normally at this point they're
all out side talking to Hammond,

575
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,781
but now he's out there all by himself.

576
00:29:07,797 --> 00:29:11,008
So let me start off with cars if I may.

577
00:29:11,469 --> 00:29:12,595
Big hollywood star obviously,

578
00:29:12,595 --> 00:29:14,593
so I presume you've got a Toyota Prius?

579
00:29:16,235 --> 00:29:19,030
You would have thought, you would have thought, um... no,

580
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,899
I have... in my life I've had 2 modes of car,

581
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:25,159
- Little tiny tossers' cars
- Uh hum.

582
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,909
And great big [beep] cars.

583
00:29:29,805 --> 00:29:31,989
- Um...
- And you're in which mode now?

584
00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:32,874
Do you know,

585
00:29:32,993 --> 00:29:34,669
the first time I'm right in between the 2,

586
00:29:34,677 --> 00:29:37,039
the tossers' cars began with a...

587
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:41,246
a Citroen Dyane and I don't think you
can get much tossier than that.

588
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,176
Well the great thing about...
No the great thing about the Dyane is

589
00:29:43,176 --> 00:29:45,276
you could crash it and nobody ever knew

590
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:46,994
'cause there were so many different angles on it

591
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,226
that it was sort of always in...

592
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:50,144
Yes, yes, I know what you are saying,

593
00:29:50,152 --> 00:29:51,591
also it was... you couldn't hurt anyone

594
00:29:51,591 --> 00:29:53,547
because it had the power of 4 harnessed children

595
00:29:53,648 --> 00:29:54,419
and there is...

596
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:56,383
And then you got into the kind of

597
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:59,490
- well you eloquently put it Wankers' cars
- Yeah.

598
00:29:59,747 --> 00:30:01,237
Which started with?

599
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:04,835
Well it started with um... an Aston Martin Vanquish

600
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:06,071
which was a beautiful car,

601
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:07,417
you want to lick it or...

602
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:10,745
mate with it or something, but

603
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,819
I never really wanted to drive it very much 'cause

604
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:16,163
the gears did... just occasionally, just when you were feeling

605
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,576
happy in your car would just seize up, the car would stop,

606
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:20,523
you couldn't even push it to the side of the road,

607
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:22,681
you're just there on the A316 with people

608
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:25,011
going past making wanker signs at you.

609
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:28,923
A lovely car.

610
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:31,124
Yeah and then it was Bentley, wasn't it?

611
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,062
Then I... yeah I did have a Ben... I had a footballer's car,

612
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,823
Bentley GT Continental um

613
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,796
and very nice again,

614
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:38,531
but I've got a bad back

615
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:42,475
and for some reason it manifests
itself some times as back pain

616
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:44,058
and some times as bollock pain

617
00:30:45,972 --> 00:30:47,106
with the uh...

618
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:50,335
with the GT Continental, I got terrible bollock pain

619
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:52,657
some cars seats do it

620
00:30:52,657 --> 00:30:55,577
my brother's Golf GTI was the first one

621
00:30:55,967 --> 00:30:59,706
hence the syndrome is now known as golf ball. Um...

622
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:04,873
and I got it very badly with the GT Continental
so that had to go back after 6 months.

623
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:06,202
Because of your testicles?

624
00:31:06,261 --> 00:31:08,242
Yes, I didn't say that to the... um garage.

625
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,687
So um... then what... after the Bentley was?

626
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:13,338
Then...

627
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:16,639
I had a beautiful Porsche which I actually phoned you about.

628
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,035
Yeah, well, actually your girlfriend phoned me up

629
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,243
- Yes
- And said listen

630
00:31:20,252 --> 00:31:22,419
- I've got to get Hugh a car
- Yeah

631
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:24,894
a Porsche...
a Porsche, well that's wrong for a kick-off

632
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,909
- but anyway she was adamant it was going to be a Porsche
- Yeah

633
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:30,163
And then wanted to know whether it's going
to be an automatic or manual gearbox?

634
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:31,062
- Yeah.
- So I said automatic.

635
00:31:31,062 --> 00:31:33,024
Yeah, you're absolutely right and of course I got the manual,

636
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:36,648
and it's so exhuasting...

637
00:31:36,665 --> 00:31:38,654
- 'Cause you want...
- All I wanted was a comfy environment

638
00:31:38,654 --> 00:31:40,948
And a nice arm chair and for my balls not to hurt,

639
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:43,771
I got... it's not asking much for a car.

640
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:45,843
And the Porsche also has its interesting thing,

641
00:31:45,852 --> 00:31:49,087
I think it's fine if the steering wheel's
on "ze" left for "ze" Germans

642
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:51,086
- I see, yeah
- But on the right for the Brits,

643
00:31:51,445 --> 00:31:53,579
something's wrong I think the petrol tank's in the wrong place

644
00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:55,077
so you're facing forward like this

645
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,387
with your upper body and your lower body is here

646
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,343
sort of just looking dile... directly left,

647
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:01,833
and I found that tricky.

648
00:32:01,884 --> 00:32:04,711
That is tricky, I once had that in a Lancia Stratus

649
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,583
but all... annoyingly in the Lancia
Stratus all of you face this way

650
00:32:09,175 --> 00:32:11,212
while travelling in that... which

651
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:14,989
it is really does make... it...
the sensation of speed is tremendous

652
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,945
But you'd hit quite often.

653
00:32:17,343 --> 00:32:19,722
Now your driving, how's that?

654
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,246
Do you have road rage?

655
00:32:21,748 --> 00:32:24,068
Terrible rage, yes, and uh...

656
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:28,777
well yeah, it's road rage that then becomes
terrible road meekness in a flash...

657
00:32:28,777 --> 00:32:30,690
in an instant... there was this guy who

658
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,534
gave me the lightest of knocks,
I mean barely touched the car

659
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:36,693
and I went into a complete melt down,

660
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:37,722
um... attacked him

661
00:32:37,807 --> 00:32:39,426
and when he wouldn't get out of his car, I thought

662
00:32:39,461 --> 00:32:41,295
Well I'll attack the car!

663
00:32:42,949 --> 00:32:45,734
And I ripped the wind screen wipers right off his car,

664
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:46,958
amazed at my own strength,

665
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,006
and he said "You've ripped the
wind screen wipers off my car"

666
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:52,151
and immediatelly I said "I'm so sorry."

667
00:32:53,702 --> 00:32:56,783
"maybe if I... " I tried to put them back
on, I said "I'll drive you to a garage"

668
00:32:56,902 --> 00:32:59,340
Pathetic... if you're gonna be angry you know, follow it through.

669
00:32:59,374 --> 00:33:01,642
I once told... um someone who is staying...

670
00:33:01,677 --> 00:33:04,714
who had a dog in the hotel next
to um... where I was staying

671
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:05,985
that kept barking 5 o'clock in the morning,

672
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,247
I got up and then hadn't planned,

673
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:09,367
this is always the play, if you don't
plan what you're going to say

674
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:10,311
- all goes wrong
- Yeah.

675
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:12,668
I got out not sure quite what I was going to say, so I went

676
00:33:12,677 --> 00:33:14,869
"I've killed before!"

677
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:19,356
My wife was going "What have you
killed before?" Anyway, that's...

678
00:33:20,353 --> 00:33:22,199
Let's talk about films, if we may.

679
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:23,886
- Your new film
- Yeah.

680
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,396
Ok, is you and Drew Barrymore

681
00:33:26,531 --> 00:33:27,979
- Yes, sir
- And it's called?

682
00:33:28,393 --> 00:33:30,222
- It's called "Music and Lyrics"
- "Music and Lyrics"

683
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:33,137
Now, I'm sorry about this, we... we never
normally do plugging on the show,

684
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,047
- so I'm not very good at it. We'll try,
- OK

685
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,476
have you got any clips here?
That doesn't work, does it?

686
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:40,803
We do have a clip, let me just explain what it is, um,

687
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:43,490
I play this ex-80s pop star, fallen on hard times,

688
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:46,861
I get this new contract to write
a song for a very famous singer

689
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:48,342
like it might be Britney Spears,

690
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:50,726
I write music, I can't find anyone to write lyrics

691
00:33:50,726 --> 00:33:52,461
until I come across this girl

692
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:54,502
who sometimes waters my plants, Drew Barrymore.

693
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,144
And we write this song together and then

694
00:33:56,153 --> 00:33:59,336
the clip we see here we're just making a little demo tape.

695
00:34:01,196 --> 00:34:02,509
It sounds so good,

696
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:03,457
I can't believe it.

697
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:05,260
And now

698
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:07,347
vocals

699
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,360
no, no you see, you have to sing into the microphone,

700
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:11,478
it won't follow you.

701
00:34:11,977 --> 00:34:12,722
But I can't.

702
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:15,696
It's... it's a duet for a man and a woman,
we are as close as we've got,

703
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:18,145
your head phones and a level,

704
00:34:18,178 --> 00:34:19,863
you look nice in those, you should wear them all the time,

705
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,783
How is... that? Yes?

706
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,806
- Ok.
- Shh... Shh... Shh

707
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:26,081
It's ok

708
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:28,002
And...

709
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:32,303
"Way Back Into Love", take one.

710
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,383
Oh, oh God, I'm getting really nervous.

711
00:34:36,383 --> 00:34:36,927
You'll be fine, you'll...

712
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:39,116
just use your normal nice voice that I've heard

713
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:40,754
so much of in the last 3 days.

714
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:44,467
It's like my throat's closing up, it's like anaphylactic

715
00:34:44,594 --> 00:34:46,082
It's fine, just a 3 minute song

716
00:34:51,318 --> 00:34:55,725
(SINGING)"I've been living with the shadow overhead,"

717
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:57,460
(SINGING)"I've been sleeping with the... "

718
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,127
Just uh... a little bit louder 'cause this
song is intended for humans ok?

719
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:04,259
Very good.

720
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:09,112
Do you think?

721
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:13,760
It's a romantic comedy, Jeremy,

722
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:15,695
which is something I've never done before, so um

723
00:35:17,278 --> 00:35:18,820
I'd like to stretch myself as an actor,

724
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,479
it's all about discovery, isn't it? Reacting,

725
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,555
trying new stuff.

726
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:24,820
And it's a um... I think a lovely funny film

727
00:35:24,913 --> 00:35:27,190
Its open's on um..on the 9th of February.

728
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:28,822
Em... can I just talk... ok,

729
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:31,114
you're... we're the same age, give or take, I think...

730
00:35:31,114 --> 00:35:32,900
- It's hard to believe to look at it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

731
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:34,945
Frankly it is, yeah.

732
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:37,273
Are you starting to fall to pieces yet?

733
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:39,935
- Yes I am, yes I am , Jeremy. Yes.
- Are you?

734
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:42,221
Uh... worst bit for me,

735
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:44,547
is when you're...

736
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:47,552
you've wash... you've shaved,
you're rinsing your face like this,

737
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,806
and then you look up into the mirror,

738
00:35:49,806 --> 00:35:51,136
I've got a mirror to the side here.

739
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:54,009
My eyes look up but my face is still pointing down.

740
00:35:55,634 --> 00:35:56,447
- That's...
- That's how.

741
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:58,657
And also didn't you have some trouble with your bottom?

742
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,653
That was a terrible moment, yeah,

743
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,769
that was a really terrible... I... I...

744
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:05,884
funnily enough that was for "golf ball", it was.

745
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:07,806
I went to see a doctor in Harley Street,

746
00:36:08,525 --> 00:36:11,036
and I... it was suspicious of him
to begin with 'cause he said uh...

747
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,204
"Very good if you'd just like to sit, pull all your clothes off?"

748
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:14,689
So I... I took them all off,

749
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:16,755
and then he interviewed me. I sat...

750
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:21,920
I sat naked as a baby

751
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:25,349
in front of him like this in a... in a very
expensive big consultation room

752
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,181
while he wrote down things about me, kept
looking at me and writing all the things down.

753
00:36:28,528 --> 00:36:31,791
And then he said "Right, we're just going to
uh... do a quick uh... prostate examination."

754
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:33,206
Bent me over,

755
00:36:33,723 --> 00:36:36,373
and I swear to God, stuck his head up my bottom,

756
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,482
because when he said "Does that hurt?"

757
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,573
it was muffled, it was "Does that hurt?"

758
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,116
And it was the worst pain I've ever had in my life.

759
00:36:48,455 --> 00:36:51,604
Ok listen, I really want to get onto your lap, obviously.

760
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,001
- Yes.
- How did it go out there?

761
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,331
I thought quite badly, um...

762
00:36:55,898 --> 00:36:58,337
I like the Stig very much, he was very kind to me

763
00:36:58,506 --> 00:37:02,383
um... but uh... it's not easy, it's not easy Jeremy.

764
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:04,025
- You don't think so.
- No, I don't.

765
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:05,761
'cause it's so counter-intuitive,

766
00:37:05,854 --> 00:37:06,956
you know? Just when you're thinking:

767
00:37:06,956 --> 00:37:09,004
Well now I'm going to die so I'll brake

768
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:11,027
but he says "Flat down with the accelerator!"

769
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,454
And uh... and the other way around and um...

770
00:37:13,454 --> 00:37:15,309
I... I know I'm gonna be bad.

771
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:18,023
Who here would like to see Hugh's lap?

772
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:21,326
(Crowd) Yeah!
- Let's play the tape, here it goes.

773
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,554
This is you

774
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,375
and there you go.

775
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:27,372
What a car.

776
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,494
- That's...
- A very unattractive helmet.

777
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:33,635
Oh, don't change gear, you [beep]!

778
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:38,190
- Crikey Moses!
- That can not be my best...

779
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:41,755
that's quite grown up.

780
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:43,634
That was very good through there, excellent.

781
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,365
- Oh where are you going now though? Yeah.
- That's...

782
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:47,579
Hammerhead

783
00:37:47,994 --> 00:37:50,271
- looking smooth and fast
- I never mastered the Hammerhead

784
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:52,337
- Is that a penalty?
- That's good, no that's good.

785
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:53,936
Good line through there.

786
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,036
Oh that was a piece of "art"

787
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,635
Oh [beep]

788
00:37:59,253 --> 00:38:02,229
Soon you're gonna cut inside and you won't be swearing.

789
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:03,347
Is it gonna be fast through here?

790
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,269
See? Every time I came wobbling through a turn

791
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:08,062
there was another ex-BBC camera man right in my way.

792
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,390
Did exactly the wrong thing again.

793
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:12,845
And here we are, last corner

794
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:14,506
- This is very poor
- That's going wide

795
00:38:14,507 --> 00:38:17,481
that's wow yes! Across the line!

796
00:38:18,531 --> 00:38:18,937
Now

797
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:26,442
I um...

798
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:31,318
I know it's not good, I know, I feel...
I feel like I've let anyone... everyone down

799
00:38:31,377 --> 00:38:32,933
- and including the Stig.
- No, what do you mean? It's only yourself.

800
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:36,912
So where do you think you've come on the um...

801
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:38,356
- on the board?
- Ah, I wish I knew.

802
00:38:38,356 --> 00:38:40,653
Who would I really like... I wouldn't like to come lower

803
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:43,455
than Michael Gambon.

804
00:38:43,616 --> 00:38:45,715
- Michael Gambon? You've beat him.
- Yeah.

805
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:49,684
Oh that's good. In that case, I... I quite
like to beat you and McGregor.

806
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:53,556
- Well, you actually did it in 1 minute
- Yes.

807
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:55,833
- Forty
- Yes

808
00:38:57,052 --> 00:38:59,614
- Seven... Point seven
- Yes

809
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,276
- Oh hello.
- Congratulations!

810
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:10,544
You're right up there.

811
00:39:11,543 --> 00:39:13,651
You're in fact only emm..

812
00:39:14,158 --> 00:39:16,808
point one of a second behind the well spoken man.

813
00:39:16,884 --> 00:39:18,141
Yes, yes.

814
00:39:18,141 --> 00:39:19,479
Anyway, so there you are, uh...

815
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:22,422
Ah sorry but Jamie Oliver was in the
snow, so he moves up, is that right?

816
00:39:22,422 --> 00:39:25,248
No he wasn't, it had melted, he did melted snow

817
00:39:25,265 --> 00:39:27,434
- He claims it was snow, and we punished him for that
- Yes

818
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:29,518
So no, I... I think you're better

819
00:39:29,721 --> 00:39:32,752
and funnier and much better looking with a smaller tongue.

820
00:39:35,187 --> 00:39:37,016
Ladies and gentlemen, Hugh Grant!

821
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,300
Right, now, earlier, we were testing three
coupes to decide which one is best.

822
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,650
I really really like this Alfa Romeo Brera.

823
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,550
Clarkson stupidly prefers this new Audi TT

824
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,950
and the damn fool Hammond seems to
think it should be this Mazda RX-8.

825
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,470
And so far, we have established pretty much nothing.

826
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,870
But now in the second part of the film

827
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,820
we drive into Edinburgh and still arguing.

828
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,300
Can you set the sat nav in your car, OK?

829
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:25,370
Err, no, I haven't got sat nav.

830
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,920
Could you do that, Richard?

831
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,200
I go by instinct in here.

832
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,920
So it's the driver's car, or the navigator's car.

833
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,370
or the air hostess's in the case of yours Jeremy

834
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,820
Think it with a bit of dust on my headlamps,

835
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,750
so I will just wash that off.

836
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,850
Yes, I've done that with my headlamp washers.

837
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,300
Have you done that, James?

838
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,500
Well I did that earlier with a wet hanky and end of my finger.

839
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,550
But either of you two got a DSG gearbox.

840
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,920
- No. - No.

841
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,850
Have you got adjustable suspension, either of you?

842
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,470
- No. - No.

843
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,600
But then I fired a torpedo

844
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,420
straight into the side of HMS Clarkson.

845
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,400
Jeremy, can I just ask how much of that stuff is standard.

846
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,620
Almost everything really is an optional extra.

847
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,470
How many is that lot cost?

848
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:19,070
Err, the optional extras on this car add up 2000 pounds.

849
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,200
How much?

850
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,100
Six (more) thousand pounds.

851
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,800
Six grand?

852
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,670
It's actually eight grand but shh...

853
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,500
It was tit for tat all the way and nobody was going to give in.

854
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:35,700
The truth of the matter is this

855
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,170
the car you really want

856
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,620
looks like the Alfa

857
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,970
drives like the Mazda

858
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,220
and is built like the Audi.

859
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,800
But since that doesn't exist

860
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,270
you've got to have the Audi.

861
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,050
Cause it's the best all round of the best compromise

862
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,570
and that, that's an end of it.

863
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,670
It wasn't the end though,
because coupes are all about looks.

864
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,750
And to find out which of ours was the best looking

865
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:03,770
we've been told to go to the Scottish National
Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh.

866
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,050
The challenge was simple,

867
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:10,850
if this prestigious gallery was to accept just one of our cars

868
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:15,150
based on styling and love, which would it be?

869
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,270
A panel of experts have been assembled to make the choice.

870
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,900
And to help things along,

871
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,900
we'd each been given two minutes to argue
the artistic merits of our particular car.

872
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,920
But before that,

873
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,170
five minutes in the gallery bookshop to bone up our art bit.

874
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,120
Is there anything Japanese at all?

875
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,050
Scottish arts...

876
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:42,720
You have like a single volume on the
artistic influence of Alfa Romeo coupes.

877
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,320
Err, Japanese culture in general maybe like into an oyster.

878
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,750
Opening itself up to repeat the onslaughts from the... oyster.

879
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:59,270
Unfortunately the crash course in the bookshop
just confused us even more.

880
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,970
As the experts discovered when James kicked things off.

881
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,600
Em, good afternoon professors.

882
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,600
I'd like to begin by asking the question

883
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,900
Can a car be a piece of art.

884
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,350
I'd like to say immediately that I think no.

885
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,120
That's not a piece of art

886
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,250
but can we find any art in that piece of design?

887
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,520
I'll put it down there.

888
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,070
Can I really argue that the Audi TT was a reaction

889
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,150
to the overly complicated ceiling rose of Victorian houses?

890
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,650
For example we can see in the lights of the Alfa Romeo here

891
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,400
I think the influence of the Scottish colorists,

892
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,370
namely Fergusson and Peploe

893
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:39,170
You went to art school, you should be good at this.

894
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,570
Did you go to art school?

895
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:41,320
No, I didn't.

896
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,600
Then you wouldn't know what you do in art school

897
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,250
is drink and pursuing women.

898
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,470
All arts I believe should be about two things,

899
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,950
truth and beauty.

900
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:50,300
Now, it's true because it's real.

901
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,850
It's not actually a piece of art.

902
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,770
How do we shut this man up?

903
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,220
Do you know what? We've made amphibious cars,

904
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:59,200
we've made a convertible people carrier,

905
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,050
I've raced you to Oslo

906
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,650
This is the hardest thing I've ever faced.

907
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,850
He's given the impression that he's taken

908
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,150
his brush oil, even his calligraphy pen,
the impression he has given...

909
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,400
I think we've probably heard enough,

910
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,320
That's alright with you, thank you very much.

911
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,870
I'll... I did want to talk about the renaissance
and the meaning of truth

912
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,570
-  and the development of human thought
- We could leave that for another day.

913
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:23,070
These trousers are not Bauhaus.

914
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,900
Hahaha

915
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,720
Why we mates look a bit like a monkey?

916
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,220
Their brains are big.

917
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,900
Justify why you think your car should be in this gallery.

918
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,650
Um, one can see influences of the Bauhaus thinking

919
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,250
in so many of the things around us today,

920
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,500
some of the design classic.

921
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:48,370
Um Mart Stam's cantilever chair and
the Marcel Breuer "Wassily" chair.

922
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,920
Why is he talking about chairs?

923
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,870
It looks like it's going somewhere, it looks purposeful,

924
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,800
I mean if you compare it, for example,

925
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,520
that's the inside of the Mazda,

926
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,700
that's not Bauhaus.

927
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,770
That's my trousers...

928
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,050
Woo, look, I found Jeremy's notes,

929
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,470
trousers, fat, Hitler,

930
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,600
tiger, Mazda, Alfa,

931
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,220
modernism, minimalism

932
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,520
... minimalism, modernism

933
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,170
I think it created cubism, I think it created
Picasso, no, not that one

934
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,920
Cubism came about 10 or 15 year earlier, but go on...

935
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:21,470
I don't think that... I think the Audi is Bauhaus...

936
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:27,020
But I think it's got a very contemporary veneer.

937
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,420
I mean one shouldn't hang the whole item on the Bauhaus,

938
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,250
I don't think it's

939
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,370
"Das ist einfach nicht wahr" as they would say in the Bauhaus

940
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:34,600
It's just not true.

941
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,300
What does it symbolize?

942
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:43,870
The Audi symbolizes freedom?

943
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,100
Freedom! Like that. (Brave Heart)

944
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,820
Warm in there, isn't it?

945
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,420
Err, gentlemen,

946
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:03,900
God is the reason why you might
look at this car the Mazda RX-8.

947
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,750
And see there's something a bit unusual.

948
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,350
The Mazda is a Japanese car.

949
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,150
In understanding a little bit about

950
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:15,570
why this car is different to ours.

951
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,650
And you can see that express through
out Japanese culture and paintings,

952
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,420
If you to take

953
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,146
We are just gonna see you put your hands in your pocket

954
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:22,600
'cause you're sort of refering to note here.

955
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,650
I can... I can do that.

956
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:28,270
Em, if you refer to "Catching Catfish with a Gourd",

957
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:32,120
from the 15th century by Josetsu

958
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:36,520
One of the blokes over there is an expert on
Japanese and oriental art, you know that

959
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:39,470
Can you just reiterate some of those points?

960
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:40,420
Which point?

961
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,750
The ones you just made.

962
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,120
Did you feel a bit thick when you finished doing it?

963
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,720
Thick?

964
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,120
How do you think he is gonna feel?

965
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,220
He'll probably punch one of them...

966
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,350
I've eaten brighter vegetables than he is.

967
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,270
You put this car in the gallery...

968
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:52,970
Yeah

969
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:55,720
What else are you going to have in
the environment that surround it?

970
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,170
Maybe to extend it further.. Maybe to have
some other Japanese stuff in there.

971
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,300
Do you have any examples, that you think would be

972
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,950
or value for the potential visitors?

973
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,750
Some paint. Japanese paintings.

974
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,550
By anyone particular?

975
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:13,750
That would be for, perhaps, you know, specialists to choose.

976
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,150
How did that go?

977
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,050
I think well, I think well, err

978
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,120
Do you know you're bright red.

979
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,920
Yeah, I'm hot, very hot.

980
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:29,400
The boffins conferred and then called
us all in to give their verdicts.

981
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,720
I think the Audi is err

982
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,250
you know sort of constrained, it's modest,

983
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,700
it's sort of tidy.

984
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,070
But it's not saying, doesn't say very much to me.

985
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:41,620
You know, this lessness is less for me not more.

986
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,770
Err, I'm most persuaded by the Alfa.

987
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,750
I agree entirely, yes.

988
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:51,370
The Mazda, I looked at it from various angles.

989
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,600
And it just doesn't seem to be as clear cut as

990
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,500
an expression of what the modern art motif
coupe is. And I think that's the Alfa.

991
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:05,270
In terms of the look, the style, everything that it denotes

992
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:09,620
we'd be happy to show that car
in this gallery, the Alfa Romeo.

993
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,620
Well it's alright.

994
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,620
- /
- Cause it'll just break down before it got here.

995
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,520
- /
- You get oil all over your nice floor.

996
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,670
Come on, you can stop being petty and infantile.

997
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,650
These three men are experts in art and artistic expression...

998
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:25,300
- Well, they are wrong.
- It's only 'cause I've said freedom. That's what we...

999
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,600
Well, rubbish.

1000
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,070
As Richard said: They were wrong.

1001
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,800
So now we're gonna do a much more important test

1002
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,320
which is the fastest around our track?

1003
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,720
Now obviously to find that out,

1004
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,450
we have to hand them over to our tame racing driver.

1005
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:49,120
Some say that he once had a vicious
knife fight with Anthea Turner

1006
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:54,070
and that he is in no way implicated
in the "Cash for Honours' Scandal"

1007
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,650
All we know is, he's called Lord Stig.

1008
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,220
Well that has wasted about an hour with wheel spin.

1009
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,220
Get off, he started off in the best car.

1010
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,700
The only proper sports car, of course the Mazda.

1011
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,950
Rear wheel drive of course,

1012
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,070
this is familiar to him, it feels like a sports car

1013
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:11,770
'cause it was designed as a sports car.

1014
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:12,900
<i>Radio: Lucy looked at him,</i>

1015
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,250
<i>the strong, kind face and the endearing look in his eyes,</i>

1016
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,400
<i>and she opened her heart to him.</i>

1017
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,870
Now you see, this romantic fiction, he's into it now.

1018
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,470
Right over... oh look at that, you see,

1019
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:25,300
- it's so controllable, you can steer it with the rear end.
- Is it moving? Is it moving?

1020
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,620
Rubbish, it's fast, mate.

1021
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,050
Don't ignore.  Here we go , hammerhead.

1022
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,400
- Oh
- Look at that.

1023
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,600
No, no, that's miles off.

1024
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,450
That is elegant and controlled.

1025
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,570
That really is. He'll be enjoying that in there,

1026
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:36,670
- that's familiar territory for him.
- 40?

1027
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,020
And it looks at home on the track unlike the other two.

1028
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,070
He'll have to lift off then.

1029
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:42,970
- It's not for... Oh, look at that.
- 45

1030
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:46,270
- Braking, oh he'll be around here in a minute.
- Now he's got 1 corner and the final corner,

1031
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:49,420
- under control and looking like a proper fast car
- Look at... chintzy styling

1032
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,570
- He's lost it, that's all... very bad.
- Oh, what a spectacle.

1033
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:54,950
Still there,

1034
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,900
No, good front end grip, good balance, excellent brakes,

1035
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,750
Oh ho ho, did you see that dive?

1036
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,170
Wow, it's like watching the actual studio going around, isn't it?

1037
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,400
-That's balance and poise.
- It's boring.

1038
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,920
I suppose you're gonna tell us
it's the most practical car, James?

1039
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,070
Well actually it is, you see.

1040
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,400
Because you can get 2 people in the front,

1041
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,820
2 in the back and a set of golf bats in the boot,

1042
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,500
I checked that.

1043
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,820
Oh very useful.

1044
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,770
And it goes off the road...

1045
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:17,170
You know it's no good for golf 'cause it's the least Pringly

1046
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:19,120
and now you're telling this's got golf rackets in it.

1047
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,500
- Look at that
- It's... It's not turned at all there, it understeered...

1048
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,750
Look at this, really, Ive never seen a car oversteer...

1049
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,200
He's using all the track,

1050
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,350
- that's what...
- He needs all the track, that's different.

1051
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:31,650
It hasn't let... no, here we go,
it'll just crash now, no, that was...

1052
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:32,500
Beautiful.

1053
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,970
Here we go, he's understeered...

1054
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,470
- well, no he's got it in... yes
-Very neat, clip the apex.

1055
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,950
- And here
- Steering accurately
- Out of control

1056
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,750
We got oil coming out of the bottom, right, gentlemen,

1057
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,650
behold the magnificent.

1058
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,300
Oh you're off to the hair dresser, sir?

1059
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,300
- Get off!
- Hahaha.

1060
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,650
Oh would you like any bred items?

1061
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,970
I know you're thinking this is the old TT,

1062
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:51,900
don't muddle them up,

1063
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,120
that was for air hostesses, people who are orange.

1064
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,550
This is the new one, it's a completely different animal,

1065
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,620
this remember it's only the front wheel drive one, the baby one, look at it.

1066
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,500
Front wheel drive, unlike a sports car,

1067
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,620
which would have rear wheel drive.

1068
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:03,770
Oh you just saw the back coming round there,

1069
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,400
- it's got a little bit of left off over steer.
- A little bit

1070
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,470
I saw it, I saw the front nod.

1071
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,650
Here we go, just watch this,

1072
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:10,720
look at this, compare to your one James?

1073
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,070
- It's worse.
- Boy, that was so slow!

1074
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,370
It's not worse.

1075
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,650
It is worse, look, it's on the grass, it's almost on the grass.

1076
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:18,600
The... right... honestly, this is a completely different animal

1077
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,520
than the one we used to have.

1078
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,600
- This is fast. Yes.
- No.

1079
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,470
Only the 2 Liter one, remember?

1080
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:26,470
- Just the baby.
- Miles out.

1081
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:28,820
The V6 actually is nowhere near as good as this.

1082
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:30,600
As we come up to the final corner.

1083
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,350
It's going to under steer off and crash.

1084
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:33,300
Oh, it's done it, it's off the road.

1085
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,620
It's just airborne.

1086
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,570
Right, ready?

1087
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,670
Time for the Audi

1088
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,820
1:31.4, check it out.

1089
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,400
I wouldn't... I wouldn't be so confident,

1090
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,400
because you see my car, I think on a race track,

1091
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,720
you'll find that...

1092
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,500
Hahaha, five seconds.

1093
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,350
Listen, you can stop being quite so cocky about it

1094
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:57,070
because your Audi hasn't won anything yet.

1095
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,650
Remember how it's been? It's not the
best looking, it's the most expensive.

1096
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,770
It's not the most practical.

1097
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:04,220
Exactly and we're about to find out
that it isn't the fastest either

1098
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,800
when my Mazda beats it.

1099
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:06,650
Hah! Oh...

1100
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:09,150
Damn...

1101
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:10,400
No, no, no you've won.

1102
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,520
I've lost.

1103
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,650
No 'cause I'm gonna own up now.

1104
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,150
Secretly all along Ive preferred the Alfa.

1105
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:17,120
What?

1106
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,320
No, I just know, I... seriously, I just... if it were my money,

1107
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,900
that's what Id buy,

1108
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,170
and Ill bet you any money it's the same for you.

1109
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:24,900
Yeah.

1110
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,850
Yes, I knew it, I knew it.

1111
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,920
But, I'm sorry before you get too cocky,

1112
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:32,050
I would not recommend one to a friend.

1113
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,270
That's the thing, 'cause you... well you wouldn't,

1114
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:35,320
you can't say Yes, go and buy an Alfa"

1115
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,850
'Cause then they'll spend the rest of their life in a car

1116
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,370
that just stays on the side of the motorway.

1117
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,370
So I can't recommend one to a friend. Could you?

1118
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:42,150
No, I wouldn't recommend one, no.

1119
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,950
- E... E... would you?
- Come on.

1120
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:45,620
No, alright.

1121
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,950
There you are, you see? You wouldn't.

1122
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,120
So what we've managed to establish is

1123
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,820
the best car here is the worst!

1124
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,570
Yeah, wow we're good at this.

1125
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:55,170
We are.

1126
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,270
And that's the end of the show,

1127
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,420
thank you very much for watching,

1128
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,400
next week we've got a top gear special

1129
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,043
see you then, good night.

1130
00:53:01,043 --> 00:53:06,043
