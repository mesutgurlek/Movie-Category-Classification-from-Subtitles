<i>MAN: What do you have for us, son?</i>

41
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:58,263
What I have for you
is a groundbreaking product

42
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:01,641
that Kmart has the opportunity
to have on its shelves

43
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:04,936
before anyone else
has it on their shelves.

44
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:08,439
First, some background
information on me.

45
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:12,485
I have a Master's Degree
in chemistry from UCLA.

46
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,320
For the last three years,

47
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:17,115
I worked at the
Environmental Protection Agency.

48
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,449
And trust me,

49
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,493
I didn't stay three years
because of the ladies.

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,500
I stayed because I was fascinated
by the work I was doing there!

51
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,045
Primarily that was
the sustainable technology

52
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:32,589
sourced by renewable resources.

53
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:34,716
I know what you're thinking...

54
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,844
"Boring Chemistry Alert!" Right?

55
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,512
Wrong!

56
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,516
One day, I had a breakthrough.

57
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,352
I created a micro-emulsion suspension

58
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:50,398
that harnessed
the natural cleaning power of

59
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,735
coconut oil,

60
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,655
palm kernel oil,

61
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,157
and

62
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:00,825
soy!

63
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:05,330
Not soy sauce,

64
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,540
but soybean oil.

65
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,418
And this comes together to
create what I like to call...

66
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,798
Can you see that?
I thought the table would be smaller.

67
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:17,008
Can you see it?

68
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:21,346
Scieoclean! Scieo-clean!

69
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:25,350
Science and clean in one word.

70
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,187
Okay. Very thorough.
Thanks for coming in.

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,272
And we'll be in touch, down the road.

72
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,274
I have full FDA approval,

73
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:34,525
and I have enough financial backing...

74
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:38,529
Actually, we're already in
talks with major companies...

75
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,782
Yeah. Whose products
are toxic and harmful.

76
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:43,159
...as well as
established organic companies.

77
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,535
But develop some brand recognition

78
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,288
and maybe, in a year or two,
we'll revisit.

Please convince her to come
to my singles event with me.

with him kind of instantly.

293
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,160
Okay.

294
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,329
- He lived in Manhattan, too.
- Mmm-hmm.

295
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,749
And so we came back and
we started seeing each other.

296
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:57,087
He didn't want anything serious,
but I was just caught up with this...

297
00:13:57,338 --> 00:13:59,423
- Oh, the passion of it all!
- Oh.

298
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:01,091
Andy, we were so passionate.

299
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:04,345
Feel free to skim over those
details as much as you want.

300
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,597
- I won't gross you out.
- Yeah. That's cool.

301
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,768
I mean, he didn't want to be
serious, really, at the time.

302
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,229
But I wanted a family, I wanted a baby.

00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,579
- Oh!

312
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,957
- Please. Anyway...
- Why are you telling me this?

313
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:37,211
Your father proposed within,
like, a month, I think.

314
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,964
So I went to the boy and I said,

315
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:44,301
you know, "I met somebody
and he wants to marry me,"

316
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:48,973
hoping that he would say,
"Joyce, you cannot do that.

317
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:50,933
"You cannot marry this guy!"

318
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:54,895
But he didn't say that.
You know what he actually said?

319
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,815
He said, "You're great."

320
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:04,154
But he told me to marry your father.

321
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:06,657
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

322
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,659
Oh, God.

323
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,161
I was so devastated.

324
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:16,083
I was so devastated that
I couldn't even see him again.

325
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,835
Well, what happened?

326
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,420
Well...

327
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,673
What happened?
I married your father, we moved,

328
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,925
I got pregnant, and...

329
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:29,054
When we found out
it was a boy, you know,

330
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:33,851
I started going through names,
as people do, and...

331
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:39,356
You want your child to remind you
of someone you love... Loved!

332
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,442
And so...

333
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:47,031
I named you Andy
after the boy from Florida.

334
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,537
You want more ice cream?

335
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:57,791
Holy shit.

336
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,878
Andy! Please.
Enough with the language, okay?

337
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,880
Did... Did Dad know about this?

338
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,466
Now, that is not something
that you share

339
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,884
with your husband. You know?

340
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:09,720
Holy shit!

341
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:11,347
What is wrong with you?

342
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,474
That is enough
with the street talk, okay?

343
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:14,933
Ma, I... (STAMMERS)

344
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,269
I need you to be honest with me, okay?

345
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,562
Yes, I will.

346
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,564
Is he my father?

347
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,484
(CHUCKLES) No, honey.
No, he's not your father.

348
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,652
- (SIGHS)
- No, no.

349
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,820
It was two years later when I had you.

350
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,740
His last name is Margolis.

351
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:33,243
Andy Margolis.

352
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,913
From J&R Advertising.

353
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,290
Isn't it funny how I remember that?

354
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,500
Yeah.

355
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:41,460
Yeah.

356
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,347
(DIALING)

357
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,475

358
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,185
FEMALE RECEPTIONIST: J&R.

359
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,063
Hi. I'm trying to track down someone

360
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,023
who used to work
in your New York office.

361
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:06,777
Probably many years ago.
The name is Andy, or...

362
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,613
Andrew Margolis?

363
00:17:09,947 --> 00:17:11,281
<i>Hold on, please.</i>

364
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,954
<i>Okay, I see that Andrew Margolis
is in our San Francisco offices.</i>

365
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:21,125
Okay. Great! How long ago
did he work there?

366
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,002
<i>No, sir. Mr. Margolis
is an Executive V.P.</i>

367
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,838
<i>in our San Francisco office currently.</i>

368
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:26,922
Really?

369
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,632
<i>Would you like to be connected?</i>

370
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:30,050
Okay!

371
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:31,135
(LINE RINGS)

372
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,636
<i>FEMALE ASSISTANT:
Andrew Margolis's office.</i>

373
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,638
Seriously? No shit.

374
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:38,308
Is, uh... (STAMMERS)
ls Andrew in, please?

375
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,228
<i>Mr. Margolis is in Europe
until next Monday.</i>

376
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,312
<i>This is Becky.</i>

377
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,899
Hi, Becky.
I'm a very old friend of Andrew's.

378
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:51,655
We were in Nam together?

379
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,741
Just backpacking though.

380
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,201
And I thought it would be great
to see him again.

381
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,663
So I guess he finally took the wife

382
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,999
on that trip to Europe
she's always wanted, huh?

383
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:04,376
<i>Mr. Margolis isn't married, sir.</i>

384
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,754
<i>Ls there a specific message
you'd like to leave?</i>

385
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,089
No! No. So he gets back next Monday.

386
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,174
<i>Yes, he does.</i>

387
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:13,510
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

388
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,012
(DISCONNECTS)

389
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:19,850
Holy shit.

390
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:23,061
I made eggs just the way you like them,

391
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,188
and I used turkey bacon,

392
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,815
which was on sale,
but I know it's still good.

393
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,568
I'm always concerned
for your health, right?

394
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:31,737
You know,

395
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,948
I was up all night last night,

396
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,409
because I was thinking
about your problems, Andy.

397
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,413
Jessica was your first
serious relationship.

398
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:43,582
So let's start with her.

399
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,503
I remember when you broke up,
but I can't remember why.

400
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,421
Do you remember?

401
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,133
Hmm.

402
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,261
Okay! We'll skip Jessica for now.

403
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,222
Uh, what do you think
we should do today, honey?

404
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:02,184
Oh, you know what? You have to
remind me to get Tylenol later,

405
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,560
'cause I'm running low.

406
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,688
And I also told Gayle
that I would pick some up for her.

407
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:08,232
Did I remember to call Gayle back?

408
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,776
I don't know what's happening to me.
I'm getting forgetful.

409
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:12,569
You want to come
on the trip with me, Mom?

410
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,071
Huh?

411
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:19,785
My road trip, that I'm going on.
I, uh...

412
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,455
It's long,

413
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,958
and I thought maybe
I could use some company

414
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,627
in the form of you.

415
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:35,300
You want to drive cross-country
in a car with me?

416
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,054
Yeah!

417
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:41,807
No, it's... You know,
we won't be gone long.

418
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,226
It's only eight days in a car together,

419
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,854
and then I got to be in San Francisco.

420
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,814
My last meeting's in San Francisco now.

421
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,399
What happened to Vegas?

422
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,317
(STAMMERING) I got a new meeting
last night

423
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,152
- in San Francisco, so...
- Oh.

424
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:57,072
Uh... Yeah! What do you say?

425
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,783
If this is you worrying about me, Andy,

426
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,244
you don't have to
because Mommy's fine.

427
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,037
That's not at all what it is, Ma.

428
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,414
(STAMMERS)

429
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,498
What?

430
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,750
I've had such a good time

431
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,211
hanging out with you
these last few days,

432
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,505
I thought it would be fun

433
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:17,676
to hang out even more
and spend time with you.

434
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:19,803
Wait a minute.

435
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:23,015
I want to make sure that
I'm hearing this correctly.

436
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:28,020
You want to spend a week
in a car with your mother.

437
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,188
Is that what I heard?

438
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,358
More than anything in the world.

439
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,527
Don't you think I would drive you crazy?

440
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:36,778
(LAUGHS)

441
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,364
Don't you think I might get
on your nerves a little bit?

442
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,158
No, you know what?

443
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,243
It was just a thought and
if you don't want to do it, then fine.

444
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,328
I don't want to push you...

445
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,455
What? What? Am I so awful
that you can't spend

446
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:47,706
a little time in a car with me?

447
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,708
Jesus Christ, Ma,
how did you turn this around?

448
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,752
I just invited you to... I'm inviting you!

449
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,212
Do you want to drive
across the country with me?

450
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:55,672
Well, I might have to reroute my mail.

451
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:56,757
Okay!

452
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,050
I'd have to miss my book club.

453
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:01,845
Ma, you have five seconds to tell me
whether you want to go or not.

454
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,764
And then I'm revoking my offer, okay?

455
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,057
- Are you coming?
- Okay. One, two...

456
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,017
I can't wait! What, are you kidding me?

457
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,144
- Honey! That is so exciting!
- Okay, great! Good! I am!

458
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,147
- Tateleh! My boy, my boy!
- Okay... You really are.

459
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,231
The sweetest...

460
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,400
- Look at this! I love you!
- Okay, okay, easy.

461
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,570
Oh, my God! I can't believe...
I have to call Gayle!

462
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,905
Oh, my God!

463
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,407
I'll have to retouch
my roots though before I go.

464
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:23,492
What am I gonna pack?

465
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:25,452
You've got to fill me in
on all the weather conditions

466
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,746
in all the states
that we're gonna go through.

467
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,750
Okay, it's fine. I got it. It's fine. I got it.

468
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,251
Are you sure you didn't forget anything?

469
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:34,503
JOYCE: God, I don't know
if I forgot something.

I don't think that's possible.
I may be getting a hernia.

- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'll put that here.

Good, there's not
too many people here.

if they have any kind of deal.

474
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:47,099
Okay. I Will do that.

00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:49,351
Hi, I'm Mark. I'll be assisting you.

476
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,435
Do you have a reservation?

477
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,354
I do. Last name is Brewster.

478
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,606
- Brewster. Okay.
- ANDY: Mmm-hmm.

479
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,025
There it is. I just need a valid
license and credit card.

480
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,944

- Okay, I will. Please relax.

481
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:01,446
Please calm down, Mom!

482
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,783
Sorry, but I just want
to confirm I got an SUV

483
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,118
with a GPS system in it?

484
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:08,537
I have you in a Dodge Durango,
GPS included,

486

- Great.
- Do you really need an SUV?

487
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,958
The gas'll cost more than the car.

488
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,710
So that comes out to $112 a day.

489
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,795
Wait, wait, wait! I got a coupon.

490
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:20,632
Good. Yeah. That works.
It takes 15 % off, so...

491
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:25,721
it brings your new total to $940.
Excuse me one second.

- That was very exciting.

- Really.

494

- Yes!
- I thought you forgot.

since you reminded me...

496
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:37,149
Anyway! Anyway, nowadays
small cars are fine in the snow.

497
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,900
They probably have that GPS thing.

498
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,319
They don't. Okay?
Only big cars have GPS.

499
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,905
Actually, our GPS systems
are separate.

500
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,741
You can rent them with any car.

501
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:48,910
And our economy cars
handle quite well in the snow.

- Oh, here it is.
- Okay, okay!

513
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,857
It's called <i>Middlesex.</i>
This tape is excellent.

514
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,027
It's about a hermaphrodite.
You know, a boy and a girl?

So, what's the plan,
my little co-captain?

525
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:06,238
Well, I got three meetings today,

526
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,823
and then I got a few in Virginia,

527
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,491
and the last one is in Roanoke.

528
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,076
Roanoke! Whoo!

529
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,745
Then Texas is next. Costco. That's...

530
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,915
That's a big one,
so if we want to get there in time,

531

Yes, I do. So after that...

She says it's lovely there!

538
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:29,678
I'm sure it is. So...

539
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,221
You know,
I spoke to Anita this morning.

540
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,140
Anita says that it would be good for you

541
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,433
to get some closure
with that relationship.

542
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:37,936
So if we have time,
we should meet up with her.

543
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,605
From Texas, we head to Santa Fe,

then Vegas.

in Vegas. Sounds like fun!

the other night, honestly.

We went out on this first date.

563
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:33,491
We were dancing,
and he told me that I was beautiful.

564
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:38,580
He was the first person
to ever tell me that.

Thank you! Hi! Thank you very much!

- Great!

628
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:07,729
Good luck, sweetheart!

- Yeah.

That's horrible! That's my mother!

682

Are you insane?
I need two rooms, okay?

683
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,888
Andy, don't be ridiculous.

684
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,223
Is that what you said? Two rooms?

685
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,308
It's not ridiculous. It's very necessary.

686
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:52,477
- It's a waste of money!
- Not wasting money.

687
00:30:52,727 --> 00:30:54,646
- Two separate rooms.
- Sorry.

688
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:55,980
Don't be sorry!

689
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:59,317
Just don't imply that
I am sleeping with my mother.

690
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:03,321
I am ready to go to market
and I have full FDA approval!

Ooh! That sounds very impressive, Andy!

692
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:10,828
Oh! FDA approval! Oh, that is fancy.

693
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:12,997
- Very fancy.
- Thank you, Ma. Good.

694
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:14,958
- I do have a few thoughts.
- Great.

695
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,168
It's just a little hard to follow.

696
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,213
I'm still a little unclear,
with all the coconuts...

697
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:23,341
What was that thing? "Dermal"?
For the skin?

698
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,510
Yeah. Dermal. Skin.
Yeah, I'm saying like...

699
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,097
I'm saying it's safe if you get it
on your skin or in your eyes

700
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:31,349
or if you ingest it by accident, you know?

701
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:32,892
Well, why don't you just say that?

702
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:35,520
I mean, keep it simple. Make it clear.

703
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,647
I would get personal with them, too.

704
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,608
Like, you talk about their kids,
talk about their pets.

705
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,944
Possibly seeing one of their loved ones

706
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,697
writhing in agony on the floor
because they just

707
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:49,033
accidentally swallowed some
of these other brands, you know?

708
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:50,577
That's good. You know
what I should do is actually

709
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,495
bring in a kid and poison it
in front of them.

710
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:53,663
And then they could actually just see

711
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:55,415
- what that would be like.
- Now you're being silly.

712
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,292
I'm just saying, if it's safe
to put on your skin,

713
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,459
then put it on your skin.

714
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,544
If it's safe to drink it...

715
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:00,878
- Yeah.
- ...drink it.

716
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:02,380
Real good thinking, yeah.

717
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,049
You probably need to flavor it.

718
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:06,467
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

719
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:08,886
Cherry flavor, maybe, or root beer.

720
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:11,264
It's a cleaning product, Ma,

721
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,890
so root beer might be kind of a weird...

722
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,642
No, no! Oh, mint! Mint.

723
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:16,561
I'm just saying, if you drank it,

724
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,606
it would make it
certainly more entertaining.

725
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:21,149
You know? Make it more of a show.

726
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:25,236
Well, I'm a scientist, Ma,
I'm not a performer.

727
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:28,948
So, it's not really
my priority to make it a show.

728
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,241
I'm not a showman, Ma.

729

- That is nonsense, honey.
- Yeah.

730

Remember how good you were
in Man of La Mancha?

731

732
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,999
You're right. No, you're right.
That's a great idea.

00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,084

I'll tell you what I would do.

What would you do?

736
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,173
I would change the name, too.

737
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:46,924
Because, look at this,
this is very confusing.

- What is it? Psychoclean?
- No.

739
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,387
- Skyoclean? Science Clean.
- No.

740
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,349
It's Scieoclean, and it's kind
of hard to change the name

741
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,935
because it's written on 10,000 bottles
that I've already paid for. So...

742
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,520
Well, it's just peculiar, is all.

743
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:02,440
Okay, I'll change the name.
Okay? Great. Okay. Good.

00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:24,248
You see? This is this
climate change thing!

780
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,834
It's good I brought clothes
for all kinds of weather.

781
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,920
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting my coat out!

782
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:30,046
You're not being helpful!

783
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,255
You're distracting me! Just sit down!

784
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:32,507
Where's your coat?

785
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,175
This is not very helpful right now.

786
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,761
I can't believe I let you
talk me out of getting an SUV.

787
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:37,845
I can't believe this.

788
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,183
Andy, just drive slow, okay?

789
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,434
Don't worry about
what the truckers think.

790
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:45,144
I'm not worried about
what the truckers think!

791
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:46,229
Why would I be worried about...

792
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,355
(BOTH SCREAM)

793
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:48,439
ANDY: Don't scream!

794
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:49,524
JOYCE: Let's just get off this road!

795
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:50,608
Maybe we should call Jessica!

796
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:53,361
- You've got to be kidding me!
- Okay, we won't call her!

797
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:55,780
No, we got a flat tire!

798
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:58,115
Oh, this is a nightmare!
I'm pulling over.

799
00:35:58,366 --> 00:35:59,700
<i>JOYCE'. Good. Pull over!</i>

800
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:01,953
<i>- Oh, we're going to die, Ma!
- No, we're not.</i>

801
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,163
- Where's your coat?
- Please stop talking.

802
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:05,873
<i>You know what? I deserve this.</i>

803
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:07,792
<i>This is what you get
for driving cross-country</i>

804
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,293
<i>in a skateboard.</i>

805
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:10,711
<i>JOYCE: Don't dwell on the past.</i>

806
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:11,879
<i>ANDY: It's just crazy. It's totally crazy.</i>

807
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,172
- It could be worse.
- Are you kidding me?

808
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:14,632
Look, we're seeing! We're alive!

809
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:16,843
- Okay, yeah, we're alive.
- Just thank God for that.

810
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,052
- Okay?
- Okay. I'm gonna get out...

811
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:19,178
Where's your coat?

812
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:20,805
I don't need a coat!
I'll be back in two seconds, okay?

813
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,306
- You want to take my scarf?
- No. I'm fine!

814
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:25,226
JOYCE: You're so macho!
What are you proving here?

815
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:27,478
Be careful you don't slip!

816
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:30,439
Andy, your feet are going to get soaked!

817
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,483
Where are your galoshes?

818
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,402
Oh, come on.

819
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,990
JOYCE: You're used to California,
that's what it is.

820
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,992
You don't know from galoshes.

821
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:42,994
ANDY: I don't know.

822
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,329
I don't know. It...

823
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:48,499
They don't look... They don't look flat.

824
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,419
Well, something must be
wrong with it, you know?

825
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:52,503
I don't know what's wrong.

826
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:54,171
Why don't we call Triple A?

827
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,339
Look, there's a restaurant there.

828
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:59,093
Let's go and wait inside.
Oh... Does that say "tapas"?

829
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:00,928
I love tapas!

830
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:03,014
That's not what it says, Ma!

831
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:05,600
- MAN 1: Over here, sweetheart!
- (MAN 2 WHISTLING)

832
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,727
MAN 1 I Yeah!

833
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,148
This place smells like strawberry gum.

834
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,650
ANDY: Please don't sit near me.

835
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:17,153
When I was younger,

836
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:21,115
your father tried to make me go
to one of these places with him.

837
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:22,366
He thought it would be "sexy."

838
00:37:22,825 --> 00:37:23,993
Mmm.

839
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:26,454
- Yeah. What can I say?
- (G ROAN S)

840
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,539
It's not that, is it?

841
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,335
- What? Excuse me? What?
- Your problems with women.

842
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:35,963
Do you think any of it is sexual?

843
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:37,840
I actually almost threw up
all over the table

844
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:38,925
- when you asked me that.
- Stop saying that.

845
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,259
I almost projectile vomited

846
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:41,469
- all over the bar.
- Oh, please.

847
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,763
You know, come to think of it,
when you were a baby,

848
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:45,848
about two months old,

849
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,559
your penis started turning purple.
I swear.

850
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:49,894
- Please stop.
- If I didn't inspect

851
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:52,688
that penis carefully
every day, till you were five.

852
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:54,523
I'm begging you
to stop talking right now.

853
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,360
You'd tell me if your penis
started turning purple again, right?

854
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:59,362
My penis could literally grow an eyeball

855
00:37:59,445 --> 00:38:00,446
and I wouldn't tell you about it.

856
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:01,697
I just worry about you.

857
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:04,116
- The color of my penis...
- it's not purple.

858
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:05,493
It's pink. Hi!

859
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,162
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

860
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:10,790
The roads are pretty awful.

861
00:38:10,873 --> 00:38:13,042
Could take the tow truck quite a while.

862
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:15,294
Our girl Moonlight's
pretty good with cars.

863
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,046
You want me to ask her to take a look?

864
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,547
Who's Moonlight?

865
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:20,883
Oh, my gosh, this is
the cutest little thing.

866
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:23,886
That's very nice of you, Moonlight.

867
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,846
I just wish you were wearing
something warmer.

868
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:28,391
Oh, that's sweet of you, but I'm fine.

869
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:31,268
- Put your hood up, honey.
- No. I don't want to.

870
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:34,522
Oh. Here it is.

871
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:37,525
You got ice frozen up around the tire.

872
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:40,528
It's blocking the wheel and making it
feel like you got a flat.

873
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:41,654
- My God!
- You sure about that?

874
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:42,738
You sure it's not flat?

875
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,365
I'm positive.

876
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:47,868
Wow! She really is a mechanic!

877
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,578
She really knows what she's doing.

878
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,414
My God, you weren't kidding.

879
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,915
Thank you very much.

880
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:54,875
Those heels come in handy.
I'm very impressed.

881
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,838
May I interest you in a private dance?

882
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:00,840
Oh! I'd love... Thank you,

883
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:03,843
but maybe another time
when my mom's not here.

884
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,428
On! (LAUGHS)

885
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:07,221
- Great. Thank you.
- Okay.

886
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,472
God bless, y'all!

887
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,683
- Bye bye! Cover up!
- Oh, thank you, Miss Joyce.

888
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:13,269
They're saying you shouldn't
get on the highway right now.

889
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:14,437
Are you staying local?

890
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:16,605
Yeah, we'll just get
a hotel or something, I guess.

891
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:19,233
Well, actually,
we don't have to because...

892
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:21,110
It's gonna be tough finding
a room anywhere in this.

893
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:22,194
I bet.

894
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:23,612
You got anywhere you can crash?

895
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,948
- Yeah!
- No. We do not.

896
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,242
- We do know somebody.
- We don't.

897
00:39:28,659 --> 00:39:30,077
- Don't you think we...
- No, we don't.

898
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:32,413
JOYCE: We could call... You know.

899
00:39:32,538 --> 00:39:34,790
<i>Jessica, thanks
for picking us up, honey.</i>

900
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:36,751
Your mother fills me in occasionally.

901
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,919
How have you been, honey?

902
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,089
- Uh, well, pregnant, Mrs. B.
- (BOTH LAUGH)

903
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,010
Yeah, I'm due again in April.
I feel like a house.

904
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:47,803
Oh, no. Well, you look fantastic!

905
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:49,305
Yeah. You look very pretty, still.

906
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,639
Oh, well, thank you. I...

907
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:52,767
I appreciate the lie.

908
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,393
No, not a lie at all.

909
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,605
Honestly, I don't know
how I keep getting pregnant.

910
00:39:57,688 --> 00:39:59,106
ROB: I got a theory.

911
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,150
It's called two margaritas
and Love Actually.

912
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:02,735
(ALL LAUGH)

913
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:04,111
ANDY: Every time, right?

914
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,323
JOYCE: Very nice house!

915
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,450
Yeah. Very lovely color. Good paint job.

916
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:12,453
- New paint job, new fixtures.
- It's very beautifully done.

917
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:14,538
It's quite a setup you have here.

918
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:15,623
Well, thanks.

919
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,625
Yeah, we like it.

920
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,169
I think it took a while
for my Jersey girl here

921
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,129
to get adjusted, but I think she digs it.

922
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:23,672
JESSICA: Yeah, I do.

923
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:25,591
So, wait... So, Andy, you and Jessica

924
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:26,967
were high school sweethearts?

925
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:29,345
Yeah, we dated for a while
in high school. Yeah.

926
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,305
It was great. It was a really fun time.

927
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,516
Oh, wow. Hey, you know,
she talks about you all the time.

928
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,726
- Oh!
- Really? That's funny,

929
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,853
because we've been talking
about Jessica a lot.

930
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:41,273
I don't know if we
talk about her a lot. Have we?

931
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:43,150
I mean, a normal amount.

932
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:45,277
She came up several times
in conversation.

933
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:47,488
- AN DY: Very casually.
- You see, Jessica,

934
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:51,992
Andy is still single,
and we were wondering whether

935
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:55,371
your break-up had anything to
do with it. What do you think?

936
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,791
No, yeah, don't be ridiculous.
I mean, we were just kids.

937
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,710
You broke up with me
when we were, what, like, 17?

938
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:02,962
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.

939
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,547
ANDY: Mmm-hmm.
JOYCE: Wait a minute.

940
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,508
You broke up with her?

941
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,844
Well, technically, I guess.

942
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,554
God! Remember how crazy you were?

943
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,806
I was young and kind of...

944
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:16,016
You know, I felt a lot. Big feelings.

945
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:18,477
Mrs. B, did you know that
Andy proposed to me

946
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:19,895
right before we went to college?

947
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:22,731
It was like a serious
get-on-your-knee kind of proposal

948
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:24,233
right in the middle of the football field.

949
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:26,735
It was silly. It was a silly thing to do.

950
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:29,864
I said we were too young,
obviously, and he ended it,

951
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:31,115
just like that!

952
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,324
Mmm-hmm.

953
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:33,909
Yeah!

954
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:35,578
Andy, can you imagine if I'd said yes?

955
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,954
(CHUCKLES)

956
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:39,039
No.

957
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,916
JESSICA: Hmm.

958
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,137
(SIGHS)

959
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:58,559
You proposed to her. Andy, that's so...

960
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:01,812
I wish I knew that.

961
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:06,066
Well, you do now.

962
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,073
I was just trying to help.

963
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,159
You always are.

964
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,289
Maybe it was healthy to see her.

965
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:23,125
Maybe it'll help you get on with your life.

966
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:27,922
Or maybe, just once, you could have,

967
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:31,300
one time, just minded
your own business, Ma.

968
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:32,509
Maybe that could have happened.

969
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:36,263
Look, I have Costco today, okay?

970
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:37,640
I would appreciate it very much

971
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:40,517
if we could just drive in
silence until we get to Texas.

972
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:41,602
I would...

973
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:44,772
I would appreciate that very much.

974
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:56,408
(CLEARS THROAT)

975
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,921
(MUTTERING)

976
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:20,349
They're gonna come
get me in a second,

977
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:23,143
so just wait here until I'm
back and don't talk to anyone.

978
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,980
- Can I just say one thing?
- No. You can't.

979
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,856
Andy, I don't think
they're coming to get you.

980
00:43:28,857 --> 00:43:30,276
Why would they not
be coming down to get me?

981
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:31,735
Because I'm noticing
how it's done here.

982
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:33,487
It's like a different thing. You know?

983
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,447
They come to your table or something.

984
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:38,450
The people with the red,
they see things on the table.

985
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:40,202
You bring your product or something. I...

986
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,495
Shit!

987
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:44,206
- Go away. Just leave.
- Where am I gonna meet you?

988
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:46,500
- Andrew?
- Hi! Hi there!

989
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:49,878
A pleasure to finally meet you, Andrew.
Ryan McFee.

990
00:43:50,504 --> 00:43:51,839
- Yeah. Great.
- Costco.

991
00:43:52,047 --> 00:43:54,383
This is Joyce. Joyce...

992
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:57,011
...-ton, my... Joyce Joyston.

993
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:59,263
(STAMMERING) My business partner.

994
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:00,306
- Ah!
'Yes!

995
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:01,390
I'm his business partner.

996
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:03,600
- Then you should have a seat.
- Fantastic! Yeah!

997
00:44:03,684 --> 00:44:05,853
- Of course. Have a seat.
- "Business partner, sit!"

998
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,730
ANDY: Yes. Why wouldn't you?

999
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:10,858
So, I would just like
to start by saying how

1000
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:13,652
honored I am that Costco Wholesale
would meet with me.

1001
00:44:13,736 --> 00:44:16,196
I know the backing of Costco

1002
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,366
could really make a product
into something big.

1003
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,701
Well, I'm looking forward
to hearing your pitch.

1004
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:21,785
Thank you.

1005
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,246
Now, some history on my product.

1006
00:44:24,747 --> 00:44:26,373
- I'm sorry.
- No problem!

1007
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:28,876
- What is that?
- My purse hook.

1008
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:30,169
What does it do?

1009
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:34,673
It just keeps the pocketbook
from touching the dirty floor.

1010
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:36,091
(LAUGHS)

1011
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:39,678
- Ah! That is great!
- Yeah, it's really neat.

1012
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:41,930
Where'd you get that, the purse hook?

1013
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:43,640
Uh, Amazon, I think.

1014
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:46,226
Hmm.

1015
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:51,565
(MOUTHING)

1016
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:52,816
(MOUTHING)

1017
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,234
(WHISPERING) Go.

1018
00:44:54,443 --> 00:44:56,362
(WHISPERING) No, lam not going.
It's rude.

1019
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:58,906
- Go.
- No, it would look bad.

1020
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:00,115
Get out of here!

1021
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:03,077
It's very rude. Extremely rude.

1022
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:04,620
Will you just 90?

1023
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:05,913
Stop that.

1024
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:07,915
Sorry. Please, continue.

1025
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:12,586
I created a micro-emulsion
suspension, Ryan,

1026
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,925
that harnesses the natural
cleaning and foaming power of

1027
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:19,676
coconut oil,

1028
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,221
palm kernel oil...

1029
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:24,098
Oxygen.

1030
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:25,307
...and

1031
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,601
soy!

1032
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,895
Or as I like to call it,

1033
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:32,439
- Scieoclean!
- Scieoclean!

1034
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:34,441
Sounds good.

1035
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,276
Oh, oh!

1036
00:45:37,277 --> 00:45:40,155
Scieoclean. Yes.
It took me a second. Sorry.

1037
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:44,326
It read at first like Skyoclean.
Or Psychoclean.

1038
00:45:44,618 --> 00:45:45,994
That's an unusual response.

1039
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,622
Don't get hung up on the name, Ryan.

1040
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:52,835
I mean, because Andrew
was thinking of changing it.

1041
00:45:53,127 --> 00:45:55,212
- RYAN: Oh, that's a good idea.
- Is he? Ah.

1042
00:45:55,671 --> 00:45:57,673
- Joyce is right. It's unclear.
- JOYCE: Uh-huh. I agree.

1043
00:45:57,756 --> 00:45:59,091
Yeah. I wasn't really considering it.

1044
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,134
I don't know what...

1045
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:02,094
- We talked about changing it.
- No, we didn't.

1046
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,429
- In the hotel.
- I don't remember that.

1047
00:46:03,512 --> 00:46:05,222
You said that
the other night at the hotel.

1048
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:06,348
- I did?
- Don't you remember, honey?

1049
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:07,933
- Don't call me "honey."
- Mr. Brewster.

1050
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:12,604
Maybe if you simply relabeled
the bottle "Science Clean."

1051
00:46:13,522 --> 00:46:14,773
That's a good idea.

1052
00:46:14,857 --> 00:46:16,942
I don't actually have any
money to relabel any bottles.

1053
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:18,444
Wait a minute. How much would it cost

1054
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:19,528
to relabel the bottles?

1055
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:21,196
Bulk? (SCOFFS)
A fraction of a cent.

1056
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:23,282
Half a cent!
And you're going to sell bulk.

1057
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:24,533
What's the big deal?

1058
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:26,201
Well, the aggregate amount...

1059
00:46:26,285 --> 00:46:27,953
So, listen, Andrew,
when you relabel the bottle...

1060
00:46:28,078 --> 00:46:29,079
"When" is a little preemptive.

1061
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:31,623
I don't know if I would jump
to the "when" conclusion.

1062
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:33,876
- Listen to what he's saying.
- When you do, I would change

1063
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,210
- the whole color scheme.
- I agree.

1064
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:37,421
It should be more, like, magenta.

1065
00:46:37,588 --> 00:46:38,922
What's gonna pop? You know?

1066
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:41,800
I would strongly consider
relabeling that bottle.

1067
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:43,552
I know, but I put
a lot of thought into this...

1068
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:45,304
JOYCE: Listen to what
the man is saying.

1069
00:46:45,387 --> 00:46:46,805
RYAN: You're going to have
to relabel the bottle.

1070
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:49,725
I'm not changing
the goddamn label, Ryan!

1071
00:46:54,146 --> 00:46:55,481
Okay.

1072
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,074
I know. I shouldn't have said anything.

1073
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:08,160
Yep.

1074
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:13,165
There are many other stores
besides Costco.

1075
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:15,334
Yep.

1076
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:18,337
Think of all the other sales
you already made.

1077
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:33,185
Ah!

1078
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,231
Well, the good news is,

1079
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:39,942
I have got enough hair product
to last me for years.

1080
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:47,282
(SIGHS)

1081
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:51,828
If you're going to drink all that alcohol,

1082
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:54,122
you should really hydrate.

1083
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:05,467
I don't want to say it again, so...

1084
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:09,638
So, I'll just leave the water bottle here.

1085
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:18,313
I only say that because

1086
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:21,441
I read that for every glass
of alcohol that you drink,

1087
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:23,485
you need an extra glass of water...

1088
00:48:23,986 --> 00:48:25,654
Ma. Ma!

1089
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:31,118
Can you not see that I don't
want to talk right now?

1090
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:32,786
Are you... Are you blind?

1091

Can you not tell
that I don't want any water?

1093
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:41,920
Enough with the nagging
and the water! Just shut up!

by you, can I, Andy?

Everything I say is wrong,
everything I do is wrong.

1103

Go ahead. Why don't you
keep insulting me?

No. You think I don't know that
you went to school in California

1108
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:43,231
so that you'd only
have to see me once a year?

What did I do wrong?

1111
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,530
What did I do?
Did I care for you too much?

1112
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:53,033
Did I love you too much? What did I do?

1113
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,661
- Okay, Ma.
- It's not okay!

has to be tolerated?

You don't have to like me,
or spend time with me.

But as long as I'm your mother,

1119
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:11,551
you will treat me with respect.

00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,805
that was about Macy's and...

the key in the ignition,

00:51:03,645 --> 00:51:06,356
but it wouldn't turn on.
And you know why it wouldn't turn on?

1132
00:51:06,481 --> 00:51:08,483

You know it's okay because
he calls me on my birthday

That was a very popular profession.

I was the weirdest kid in the world,

because I said organic chemist
every time!

I ever wanted to be.

Oh, that's our specialty!

It's the biggest piece
of Grade A steak around.

00:56:25,842 --> 00:56:27,343
- Yeah?
- Fifty ounces!

1240
00:56:27,844 --> 00:56:30,263
It comes with a dinner salad, roll,

1241

in under an hour,

you get it for free. And you get a T-shirt!

if you don't finish?

00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:42,942
- A hundred bucks?
- Whoa, Ma,

1247
00:56:43,026 --> 00:56:44,360
are you kidding me right now?

1248
00:56:44,611 --> 00:56:47,155
You're broke, honey.
Don't turn free down.

1249
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:48,531
And you know how I can eat!

1250
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:51,367
Yeah, that's four and a half
pounds of meat, Mom.

1251
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:53,203
That's a lot of meat!

1252
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:55,872
I mean, that's like eating
a poodle. You know?

1253
00:56:55,955 --> 00:56:57,123
You actually think you can do that?

1254
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,085
I don't just think it, honey. I know it.

1255
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:02,045
It's just if I want to do it, that's it.

1256
00:57:02,378 --> 00:57:03,797
Well, you want to do it, hon?

1257
00:57:05,632 --> 00:57:07,634
Yeah. I'm gonna do it.

on the side.

I always try and make
a stop here on my way,

1313
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:49,796
you know, at the Steak Ranch here,

1314

It doesn't, no.

1317
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:57,887
No, no. She should
save the shrimp for last.

1318

I'm kind of an expert by now.

Yeah! Sure. Why not?

- Go for it. Yeah.
- Okay.

Howdy, ma'am. Your son, Andrew,

said I should come over
and give you a hand.

1324
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:20,201
See, the key is the size
of the pieces you cut off,

1325
01:00:20,285 --> 01:00:21,744
- you gotta keep them small.
- Mmm-hmm.

1326
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:23,871
One other thing.

1327
01:00:25,415 --> 01:00:27,333
What? What is it?

1328
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:29,252
It's called the cycle.

1329
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,421
You got to learn the cycle,
which is two small pieces,

1330
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:34,632
potato, salad, then you have
two small pieces of steak,

1331
01:00:34,716 --> 01:00:36,092
- potato, salad.
- About that size?

1332
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:37,760
Yeah. That's perfect, actually.

1333
01:00:37,844 --> 01:00:39,512
You'll get that down a lot faster.

1334
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:41,764
- Okay. So two of those...
- Two of those.

I wish I could offer you some but I can't.

1337
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:46,019
No, you got to eat this all yourself.

1338
01:00:46,102 --> 01:00:47,270
- And then that.
- Yeah.

1339
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:50,356
- That's perfect.
- Is that good?

1340
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,568
Yeah, it's good. You actually
did all four at the same time.

for a little ketchup?

I think you could ask
for whatever you want, Mom.

1352
01:01:18,134 --> 01:01:19,218
I'll get you some ketchup.

1353

But I'd like a little seltzer, too.

No, no. No seltzer, you need flat water.

Seltzer will make you too full.

1356

- Where's the ketchup?
- Are you okay?

1357
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:26,976
- No, I'm not okay.
- Are you sure?

No, I'm throwing it in.

1362
01:01:32,982 --> 01:01:34,567
Andy, I don't want you
to have to pay 100 bucks

1363
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,651
- for a lousy piece of meat!
- It's fine!

than watch you vomit
in front of these people!

01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,567
We're actually
on a pretty tight schedule.

1402
01:02:57,817 --> 01:03:00,486
We're going to Santa Fe, Las Vegas,
and then San Francisco.

1403
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:03,406
Well, I do hope you get to
stop at the Grand Canyon.

1404
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:05,575
Oh, no, we can't this time

1405
01:03:05,658 --> 01:03:08,077
because we're really
on a very tight schedule.

1406

- Well, maybe next trip, then.
- Yeah.

1407

Andrew. It was a pleasure.

01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,669
Oh, yeah. You, too. Thank you so much.

1409
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:18,588
And thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

1410
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:21,090
Thank you. And could I have
a second with your mom?

1411
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:24,927
Yeah! For sure. Yeah. Thanks.

I hope this isn't being too forward,

1413
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:30,892
but when I see a woman eat like that,

1414
01:03:30,975 --> 01:03:32,935
well, it just makes a man
want to stick his neck out.

talking and eating
with someone you don't know.

1428

Some would argue that
that's actually how

you get to know someone.

1430

01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:15,736
No, they didn't!

1553
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,572
- Hi! I'm Andrew Brewster.
- Hello.

1554
01:09:18,697 --> 01:09:21,033
I'm presenting to
Home Shopping Network tomorrow.

1555
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:23,452
Oh, great. Welcome, Mr. Brewster.

1556
01:09:23,536 --> 01:09:24,662
I just need your credit card, please.

1557
01:09:24,745 --> 01:09:26,413
- Right there.
- Thank you.

1558
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:30,125
I see you're on their corporate rates.

1559
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:31,210
Oh, great!

1560
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:34,338
Here is your credit card.

1561
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,422
- Thank you.
- Perfect.

1562
01:09:37,258 --> 01:09:38,926
JOYCE: How are you doing
on this thing?

1563
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:40,845
Oh, Jesus! Okay. Okay.

1564
01:09:41,095 --> 01:09:43,931
Hey, Ma! I was gonna go take
a shower, then we should eat,

1565
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:45,266
then I want to go to the Bellagio.

1566
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:46,725
- We can see the fountain...
- No, honey, look at this.

1567
01:09:46,809 --> 01:09:48,769
Frogs. It has frogs!

1568
01:09:49,353 --> 01:09:51,397
- Great.
- And it's on the aisle.

1569
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,357
They put it in front. You know why?

1570
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:55,025
Because this is a winner.

1571
01:09:55,276 --> 01:09:56,819
Ma, there's lots of machines
on the aisles.

1572
01:09:56,902 --> 01:09:58,195
Oh, look at this,
I got a seat! The guy left.

1573
01:09:58,279 --> 01:09:59,780
- That's great.
- I'm so excited!

1574
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,365
Ma, come on, let's just go, okay?

1575
01:10:01,615 --> 01:10:04,785
No. No, no, honey.
You go up, drop the bags, shower,

1576
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:05,911
do whatever you want.

1577
01:10:05,995 --> 01:10:07,621
I'm going to play here, okay?

1578
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:09,373
Are the drinks free here?

1579
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:10,791
Yeah, the drinks are free.

1580
01:10:10,875 --> 01:10:11,876
- They're free?
- Yeah.

1581
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:15,296
So, would you please flag me down
a waitress if you see one?

1582
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:17,298
- Okay. Yeah, okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1583
01:10:17,506 --> 01:10:18,507
Great.

1584
01:10:19,133 --> 01:10:20,384
What does that mean? Do you know?

1585
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:21,468
You won about 10 cents.

1586
01:10:21,552 --> 01:10:22,887
Ten cents? That's it?

1587
01:10:23,137 --> 01:10:24,471
I got three navel oranges.

1588
01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:28,058
It's still going up!
Who do I call? Who do I tell?

1589
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:30,311
Oh, I know. I got
a good feeling about this.

1590
01:10:30,561 --> 01:10:32,229
Where are the drinks?

1591
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:33,647
Good luck with that.

1592
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:34,815
- Really?
- Yeah.

1593
01:10:43,157 --> 01:10:44,366
(DOOR LATCHES)

1594
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:50,414
Ma?

1595
01:10:51,415 --> 01:10:52,750
It's me, honey.

1596
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,585
You're finally back?

1597
01:10:55,419 --> 01:10:57,087
What time is it?

1598
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:00,341
- Hi, sleepyhead.
- Hi.

1599
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:02,051
- (GROANS)
- (CHUCKLES)

1600
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,929
Oh, I'm so excited.

1601
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:06,513
Are you up? Are you up? Are you up?

1602
01:11:06,597 --> 01:11:08,015
- Yeah.
- Mmm!

1603
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:09,767
So... (CLEARS THROAT)

1604
01:11:09,934 --> 01:11:11,352
Do you notice anything different?

1605
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:15,522
Yeah, you gamble all night
and get drunk at 7:00 a.m.

1606
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:19,526
No! No, I got my ears pierced! Look.

1607
01:11:19,944 --> 01:11:21,612
- Isn't that great?
- Oh, wow.

1608
01:11:21,862 --> 01:11:23,322
- Yeah, look at that!
- All right.

1609
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:26,700
I was up $60 and I decided
to call it quits.

1610
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:28,661
And so then I passed a jewelry store

1611
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:30,621
and I got my ears pierced!

1612
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:31,705
Okay!

1613
01:11:32,122 --> 01:11:33,874
And it didn't even hurt.

1614
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:36,877
Well, if you're happy about that,
then good for you.

1615
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:37,962
I'm happy about that.

1616
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:40,130
- I am so happy, Andy!
- Good.

1617
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:43,175
I could just stay here forever.

1618
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:47,137
Well, eventually you might
run out of things to pierce

1619
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:49,098
and your frog machine
might short-circuit.

1620
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:50,432
I don't know what you'd do after that.

1621
01:11:50,975 --> 01:11:52,601
I know. I just got carried away.

1622
01:11:52,685 --> 01:11:53,686
Yeah.

1623
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:56,981
- So, I was thinking...
- Yeah.

1624
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:59,650
...that maybe you should go
to San Francisco alone,

1625
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:02,611
and then I could spend
the rest of the weekend here.

1626
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:06,824
Uh, I don't think that's the best idea.

1627
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:07,908
Why not?

1628
01:12:07,992 --> 01:12:09,410
You know, we've been having fun.

1629
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:10,744
We should keep it going.

1630
01:12:10,828 --> 01:12:12,663
I've only been punched
in one side of my face.

1631
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:14,540
I'm letting you off the hook, you know.

1632
01:12:14,623 --> 01:12:16,792
You drove all the way to
Las Vegas with your mother.

1633
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:20,671
I have enough bragging material
to last the rest of my life, honey.

1634
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:22,089
Ma.

1635
01:12:23,007 --> 01:12:26,010
I don't actually have
a meeting in San Francisco.

1636
01:12:26,844 --> 01:12:29,513
I tracked down Andy.

1637
01:12:30,431 --> 01:12:31,598
Margolis.

1638
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,352
He's the meeting in San Francisco.

1639
01:12:36,353 --> 01:12:39,773
He had the same job.
He works for the same company!

1640
01:12:39,857 --> 01:12:42,026
He got transferred to the West Coast.

1641
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:44,695
And I got his information.

1642
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:48,532
I got his number
and his email and his address.

1643
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:52,202
And he's not married.

1644
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:55,330
So I figured why not?

1645
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:01,545
When?

1646
01:13:01,879 --> 01:13:03,213
When what?

1647
01:13:04,465 --> 01:13:06,008
When did you track him down?

1648
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:09,970
(SPUTTERS) Right after
you told me he existed.

1649
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:12,389
I tracked him down. It was really easy.

1650
01:13:16,727 --> 01:13:18,562
So that's why you

1651
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:21,398
wanted me to come with you.

1652
01:13:21,899 --> 01:13:23,984
So I could see Andy Margolis.

1653
01:13:24,068 --> 01:13:25,110
Ma, of course not!

1654
01:13:25,194 --> 01:13:28,238
I think that I wanted
to meet him, too, you know.

1655
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,074
Oh, God.

1656
01:13:30,741 --> 01:13:32,910
I was so stupid!

1657
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:35,412
Why is that... Why are you stupid?

1658
01:13:35,746 --> 01:13:37,081
Oh, my God.

1659
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:44,338
I actually thought that you
wanted to spend time with me.

1660
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:47,049
I do want to spend time with you, Ma.

1661
01:13:47,132 --> 01:13:48,842
That's why I invited you.

1662
01:13:50,928 --> 01:13:52,096
It's okay.

1663
01:13:53,639 --> 01:13:54,807
I'm not mad.

1664
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,270
I mean, most kids
wouldn't even care enough.

1665
01:14:04,942 --> 01:14:06,693
I just, uh...

1666
01:14:08,112 --> 01:14:12,449
I thought it was
something else, that's all.

1667
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,285
Ma, let's just talk about it
for one minute, okay?

1668
01:14:15,369 --> 01:14:16,370
You don't have to go.

1669
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:18,789
No, no. It's okay.

1670
01:14:19,123 --> 01:14:22,960
You better get ready
for your meeting, honey.

1671
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:25,963
ANDY: Come on, Ma!
That's not what this is...

1672
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:45,149
Andrew Brewster for Skyoclan?

1673
01:14:47,151 --> 01:14:48,485
(QUIETLY) Scieoclean.

1674
01:14:52,823 --> 01:14:54,575
Okay, Mr. Brewster,
you get five minutes

1675
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,160
to explain the product and demonstrate.

1676
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,995
Our hostess, Amy, will introduce you

1677
01:14:58,078 --> 01:14:59,746
and you can interact with her
however you want.

1678
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:00,831
Any questions?

1679
01:15:00,914 --> 01:15:04,251
Yeah, I didn't realize
this was a whole thing.

1680
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,170
I didn't realize it was on camera.

1681
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:08,672
You're gonna be great. Go for it.

1682
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,175
Hello. Hi.

1683
01:15:11,508 --> 01:15:12,634
- Andrew, hello!
- Hi, yes, I'm Andrew.

1684
01:15:12,718 --> 01:15:13,760
Nice to meet you.

1685
01:15:13,844 --> 01:15:16,555
- I'm Amy. Nice to see you.
- Hi, Amy. Hi. So...

1686
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:19,766
Oh, gee. No, thank you.
I'm okay. Thank you.

1687
01:15:20,017 --> 01:15:21,393
So we're gonna look
right out to the front here.

1688
01:15:21,476 --> 01:15:22,477
Wow! This is the real set.

1689
01:15:22,769 --> 01:15:24,771
Yes, we're on the set now.

1690
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:26,356
Roll cameras!

1691
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,441
Ooh! It's hot in here.

1692
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:29,109
It is warm. It's very bright.
I... (STAMMERING)

1693
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:32,029
- MAN: Action!
- Welcome back to HSN.

1694
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:34,531
I'm here with Andrew Brewster,

1695
01:15:34,865 --> 01:15:38,785
creator of an exciting new
organic cleaning supply.

1696
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,538
Tell us a little bit about
Scieoclean, Andrew.

1697
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:44,041
It's actually Scieo-clean.

1698
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:45,584
- That's exactly what I said.
- It is.

1699
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:47,002
Uh...

1700
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:49,963
Scieoclean, as I call it,

1701
01:15:50,047 --> 01:15:51,715
is an exciting new cleaning product

1702
01:15:51,965 --> 01:15:55,135
that harnesses the natural
foaming and cleaning power

1703
01:15:55,219 --> 01:15:56,970
of three completely
renewable resources.

1704
01:15:57,221 --> 01:15:58,805
- Interesting.
- They are...

1705
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:02,226
Here they come, out of
your special secret box.

1706
01:16:03,227 --> 01:16:05,395
- ...coconut oil...
- A coconut!

1707
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:07,731
That's a coconut. Let's see.

1708
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:09,900
That's hard.
That's a hard nut to crack, isn't it?

1709
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:29,086
As I previously stated,
a neutral pH reading

1710
01:16:29,169 --> 01:16:30,337
is somewhere between six and eight.

1711
01:16:30,921 --> 01:16:34,591
Now, if you recall,
Scieoclean came in at seven,

1712
01:16:34,675 --> 01:16:35,759
which was perfect.

1713
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:39,429
Now, my competitor's pH reading
is nine point...

1714
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:40,597
Can you see it?

1715
01:16:41,098 --> 01:16:45,352
Is it in the... I don't know
if you're zooming in on...

1716
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:49,189
But it says nine point six, which is high,

1717
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,775
and it, uh...

1718
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,286
I lost you guys. Uh...

1719
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,997
I totally lost you guys.

1720
01:17:05,372 --> 01:17:07,165
That lady's sending an email.

1721
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,167
I've completely lost you,

1722
01:17:09,251 --> 01:17:11,461
and I think I know why I lost you guys.

1723
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:15,632
It's 'cause this sucks! And it's boring.

1724
01:17:15,966 --> 01:17:19,636
And it's full of a bunch of science-y stuff
that no one really cares about.

1725
01:17:19,845 --> 01:17:22,681
So, why don't I try this?

1726
01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:25,267
Just tell me about yourself, Amy.

1727
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:27,477
Do you have kids? You have any
pets or anything like that?

1728
01:17:27,728 --> 01:17:30,731
Yes, I do. I have a dog and a little girl.

1729
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:31,982
Okay. What are their names?

1730
01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:34,401
Mr. Pickles and Gabriella.

1731
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:38,363
Oh, that's funny. If I have a daughter,
I'm gonna name her Mr. Pickles as well.

1732
01:17:38,447 --> 01:17:39,990
(LAUGHING)

1733
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:42,242
AMY: Sorry.

1734
01:17:42,326 --> 01:17:43,910
So let me ask you,

1735
01:17:43,994 --> 01:17:45,370
you probably go through great pains

1736
01:17:45,454 --> 01:17:47,372
to prevent Mr. Pickles
and Gabriella from dying,

1737
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:49,333
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Well, yes, I would.

1738
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:51,376
Is this what you normally
clean your house with?

1739
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,420
It's whatever's on sale.
It's usually blue or yellow.

1740
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,755
That would be correct, yes.

1741
01:17:55,005 --> 01:17:56,465
Well, here's the problem with that.

1742
01:17:56,548 --> 01:17:58,675
It's extremely poisonous.

1743
01:17:58,884 --> 01:18:01,803
And it's really dangerous.
I can show you statistics

1744
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:04,014
and experiments
that prove that my product

1745
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:06,433
doesn't only clean better
than those, but it's safer.

1746
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,936
But if I've shown you one thing,
it's that that is really boring.

1747
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:12,189
So instead, I'll just do this.

1748
01:18:14,358 --> 01:18:16,693
I'll step back for the experiment.

1749
01:18:20,697 --> 01:18:22,032
Oh, my God.

1750
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:27,204
Wow. I'm impressed.

1751
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:28,538
I am.

1752
01:18:30,457 --> 01:18:34,211
Scieoclean is the best cleaning product
that's ever been invented.

1753
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:36,505
It's completely natural,
it's completely safe,

1754
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:38,882
and it cleans better than
any product on the market.

1755
01:18:38,965 --> 01:18:41,802
If any of my competitors
are making the same claim,

1756
01:18:41,885 --> 01:18:43,136
all I say is, come on TV

1757
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:46,056
and drink your product.
But I don't think you will

1758
01:18:46,306 --> 01:18:48,892
because no one wants to
shit blood on TV.

1759
01:18:51,061 --> 01:18:52,312
That's it. That's all I got.

1760
01:18:52,604 --> 01:18:53,897
(CHUCKLING)

1761
01:18:54,898 --> 01:18:57,401
Scieoclean. It's safe, it's non-toxic,

1762
01:18:57,734 --> 01:19:00,028
- and you can drink it.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

1763
01:19:00,654 --> 01:19:01,947
And cut!

1764
01:19:02,197 --> 01:19:03,865
Uh, Mr. Brewster?

1765
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:05,075
Yeah.

1766
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:06,493
Well, we are intrigued!

1767
01:19:07,577 --> 01:19:08,829
You're...

1768
01:19:09,538 --> 01:19:11,289
- You're intrigued?
- Absolutely!

1769
01:19:11,373 --> 01:19:12,791
That presentation was wonderful.

1770
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:13,875
You actually drank that stuff?

1771
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,752
I did drink it! Yeah!
It's made out of food.

1772
01:19:15,836 --> 01:19:16,837
It was a great pitch.

1773
01:19:17,129 --> 01:19:19,339
Thank you so much!
If you want to hear more...

1774
01:19:19,423 --> 01:19:20,632
I said it was boring, but the stuff about

1775
01:19:20,715 --> 01:19:22,008
the micro-emulsion
is actually pretty amazing.

1776
01:19:22,217 --> 01:19:24,511
- Does it actually clean?
- Yes, it cleans great.

1777
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:25,929
Okay, we're gonna wanna
see that at some point.

1778
01:19:26,012 --> 01:19:28,014
Oh, yeah, anytime. I can
demonstrate that anytime.

1779
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:30,308
- And it has full FDA approval?
- I have full FDA...

1780
01:19:30,392 --> 01:19:31,977
How many units
do you have ready for market?

1781
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:35,313
Thousands of units. I have way
more than I should, probably.

1782
01:19:35,397 --> 01:19:37,399
Well, we're gonna have to run
it up the ladder, obviously,

1783
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:39,651
but I have a really good
feeling about this.

1784
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:41,570
Thank you so much.

1785
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,656
Oh, thank you! Thanks. Wow.

1786
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:46,158
Great presentation.

1787
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:47,534
Well, I'm glad you think so.
You have my info.

1788
01:19:48,076 --> 01:19:50,579
Absolutely. We'll be in touch. Great job.

1789
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:52,497
Thanks for sticking with me.

1790
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:55,000
(WHISPERING) Just don't say anything.

1791
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:56,251
Just turn around. Just keep walking.

1792
01:19:56,334 --> 01:19:57,794
- I'm not saying anything.
- Just turn around.

1793
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:01,256
- People love a performance.
- Stay calm. I know, I know.

1794
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:03,133
<i>This was better than Man of La Mancha!</i>

1795
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:05,135
- So how bad did it taste?
- It was horrible!

1796
01:20:05,594 --> 01:20:06,761
It was so gross!

1797
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:08,430
- Well, you acted great.
- Oh, thank you.

1798
01:20:08,513 --> 01:20:09,848
- It needed the mint.
- It does.

1799
01:20:10,098 --> 01:20:11,641
What about the guy?
What did he say to you?

1800
01:20:11,725 --> 01:20:13,935
He said it was a great pitch.

1801
01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:15,854
He said he's going to
move it up the ladder.

1802
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:17,606
Â€œNo!
'Yes!

1803
01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:19,774
- He used the ladder word?
- He used the word "ladder"!

1804
01:20:19,858 --> 01:20:21,026
- I know!
- You're going to be famous!

1805
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:23,695
I might be, I don't know!
(LAUGHING)

1806
01:20:23,778 --> 01:20:25,572
Do you still want to go
to San Francisco?

1807
01:20:26,907 --> 01:20:27,908
Seriously?

1808
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:29,868
Yeah.

1809
01:20:30,785 --> 01:20:32,829
We're practically there.

1810
01:20:32,913 --> 01:20:35,916
You're curious, I'm curious, so,
what the hell?

1811
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:40,462
Yeah, if... Are you...
Are you sure you want to?

1812
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:42,797
Yeah.

1813
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,966
Okay. (CHUCKLES) Great.

1814
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,051
- Okay.
- Okay

1815
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:48,887
JOYCE: So, honey, what if you
take an eye dropper

1816
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,222
and you drop it in your eyes?

1817
01:20:50,472 --> 01:20:52,349
ANDY: Oh, you're right! You know what?

1818
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:54,142
It's actually not a bad idea.
I should do it.

1819
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:55,268
JOYCE: You could also
put it in your nose.

1820
01:20:55,352 --> 01:20:56,353
AN DY: Right.

1821
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:02,567
<i>JOYCE'. So what was your plan?</i>

1822
01:21:02,817 --> 01:21:05,111
<i>ANDY'. Um, well, I thought you'd call him</i>

1823
01:21:05,403 --> 01:21:07,072
and you'd say, "Hey, remember me?"

1824
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:10,659
And then you guys would
go have some tea,

1825
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:13,495
- and then you would marry each other.
- (CHUCKLES)

1826
01:21:14,829 --> 01:21:17,666
Well, then you don't have
to pay for my old age home.

1827
01:21:17,749 --> 01:21:19,167
Exactly. That's the real plan.

1828
01:21:19,251 --> 01:21:20,293
Very, very good thinking.

1829
01:21:20,377 --> 01:21:21,670
Here. Here. His number's on top there.

1830
01:21:21,753 --> 01:21:22,754
- What?
- Call him.

1831
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:24,381
Put it on speakerphone.
Put it on speakerphone.

1832
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:25,924
- Oh, no, honey...
- I want to hear. Yeah.

1833
01:21:26,007 --> 01:21:29,344
Okay. This is the moment of truth. Okay.

1834
01:21:30,345 --> 01:21:32,556
I hope he's home. I hope he's not home.

1835
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:33,640
I hope he's home.

1836

- (CHUCKLES)
- This is very tense for me.

1837
01:21:36,518 --> 01:21:37,852
How'd you get this number?

1838
01:21:38,019 --> 01:21:39,437
Well, there's this Internet now.

1839
01:21:39,521 --> 01:21:41,690
- Oh! Oh, right.
- It has tons of information.

01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:46,486
You sure that this is his number?

- That is the number.

Just remember one thing.

2015
01:30:09,697 --> 01:30:12,533
If all the boys in the world were lined up

2016
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:13,785
and I could only pick one...

2017
01:30:13,868 --> 01:30:16,537
I wouldn't have let you
pick anyone else, Ma.

2018
01:30:16,829 --> 01:30:18,247
Yeah, you would have.

2019
01:30:18,331 --> 01:30:20,291
You would have
let Mrs. Shapiro pick you.

2020
01:30:20,374 --> 01:30:21,709
- No, I would not.
- You loved her cookies.

2021
01:30:22,001 --> 01:30:24,003
They were really good cookies.
(LAUGHS)

2022
01:30:34,055 --> 01:30:35,723
I miss you already.

2023
01:30:48,194 --> 01:30:50,863
You know, this was
the best week of my life.

2024
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:53,199
I love you, Mom.

2025
01:30:57,370 --> 01:30:58,871
Okay. Bye.

2026
01:31:12,343 --> 01:31:13,427
Okay.

2027
01:31:14,053 --> 01:31:17,223
You've got to be kidding me.
This is a new record.

2028
01:31:20,726 --> 01:31:22,728
Hi. Ben?

2029
01:31:23,062 --> 01:31:26,065
It's Joyce. Yeah, the big eater.

2030
01:31:27,775 --> 01:31:29,026
(CHUCKLES)

2031
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:31,904
Okay.

2032
01:31:34,532 --> 01:31:36,284
(CHATTING INDISTINCTLY)

2033
01:31:39,245 --> 01:31:40,913
- Mom, you want to try some?
- Sure.

2034
01:31:41,247 --> 01:31:42,915
You see, Mom?

2035
01:31:43,416 --> 01:31:45,084
It's right over there.

2036
01:31:45,418 --> 01:31:46,752
Hello, Mom.

2037
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:28,127
I think we should think about
taking another trip,

2038
01:32:28,252 --> 01:32:29,795
in Europe. How about that?

2039
01:32:30,338 --> 01:32:32,340
- You want to go to Europe?
- What do you think about that?

2040
01:32:32,632 --> 01:32:34,300
I don't think that's a very good idea.

2041
01:32:34,508 --> 01:32:36,510
I am so fascinated
with the Book on Tape,

2042
01:32:36,636 --> 01:32:38,221
I want to finish it, I sit in the garage.

2043
01:32:38,346 --> 01:32:39,430
Well, I hope you turn the car off,

2044
01:32:39,513 --> 01:32:40,681
'cause you're gonna die if you don't.

2045
01:32:40,973 --> 01:32:41,933
I know. I know.

2046
01:32:42,016 --> 01:32:43,309
- I gotta remember that.
- That would be good.

2047
01:32:43,476 --> 01:32:45,186
Since I was your mother and your father,

2048
01:32:45,311 --> 01:32:46,479
and I had to tell you about sex.

2049
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:47,563
Yes.

2050
01:32:47,647 --> 01:32:48,731
Did that help you in your life?

2051
01:32:48,814 --> 01:32:50,733
Well, you can't undo
the fact that you told me

2052
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:53,027
about penetrative sex at a young age.

2053
01:32:53,152 --> 01:32:55,363
But I guess... I don't know.

2054
01:32:55,488 --> 01:32:56,822
Just don't do that in the future.

2055
01:32:57,031 --> 01:32:58,157
Well, I'll give you my number.

2056
01:32:58,282 --> 01:32:59,242
Okay.

2057
01:32:59,325 --> 01:33:00,618
And you give us a call
when you're in town.

2058
01:33:00,701 --> 01:33:02,245
Yeah, you guys should
probably keep in touch.

2059
01:33:02,328 --> 01:33:03,329
All right.

2060
01:33:04,830 --> 01:33:07,291
Like, as a rule?
They just rape all the time?

2061
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:10,711
No, not all the time.
Sometimes. But you never know.

2062
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:12,838
They may not rape you, but...

2063
01:33:13,172 --> 01:33:16,008
- They'll rape someone.
- They're gonna rape someone.

2064
01:33:19,011 --> 01:33:21,138
- They might rape both of us.
- Oh, no!

2065
01:33:21,222 --> 01:33:23,557
I carry the Books on Tape
in a Walkman.

2066
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:25,810
- In a what?
- A Walkman.

2067
01:33:25,893 --> 01:33:27,603
In a Walkman?

2068
01:33:27,687 --> 01:33:29,897
Do you have to get in
a time machine before you use that?

2069
01:33:30,189 --> 01:33:31,941
You should call Cousin Lowell.

2070
01:33:32,024 --> 01:33:33,526
I should call Cousin Lowell?

2071
01:33:33,859 --> 01:33:35,319
Have I ever met Cousin Lowell?

2072
01:33:35,403 --> 01:33:37,113
It doesn't matter. He has T.B.

2073
01:33:37,196 --> 01:33:38,239
it would be very nice to hear from you.

2074
01:33:38,364 --> 01:33:41,075
- He has tuberculosis?
- It's around now.

2075
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,119
- Do people still get that?
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.

2076
01:33:43,202 --> 01:33:44,954
I thought they stopped getting that,
like, in cowboy times?

2077
01:33:45,037 --> 01:33:46,247
Didn't you hear that story... No.

2078
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:48,749
Didn't you hear that story
about the guy on the plane?

2079
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:51,544
- He had tuberculosis?
- And he infected the people.

2080
01:33:51,877 --> 01:33:53,546
Was Lowell on that plane?

2081
01:33:53,713 --> 01:33:54,714
I think so.

2082
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:56,299
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Exit'</i> in <i>1,000 feet.</i>

2083
01:33:56,382 --> 01:33:57,466
Come on! Exit!
A thousand feet! Just exit!

2084
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:58,676
How far is 1,000 feet?

2085
01:33:58,759 --> 01:33:59,844
You got to merge, Ma! That way!

2086
01:33:59,927 --> 01:34:01,262
Into what, honey? Into what?

2087
01:34:01,387 --> 01:34:02,555
Into the exit!

2088
01:34:02,763 --> 01:34:06,017
I'm driving 65 miles an hour
and she's talking in feet.

2089
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,227
- Who the hell is that?
- Holy shit, there's a woman!
