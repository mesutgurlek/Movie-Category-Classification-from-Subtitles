1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,629
FABER COLLEGE - 1962

2
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,319
Take off that beanie.

3
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,031
- We're meant to wear them to homecoming.
- Don't be a fruit, okay?

4
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,789
Okay.

5
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,676
Doug Neidermeyer,
Omega membership chairman.

6
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,909
Larry Kroger.

7
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,109
This is my roommate, Kent Dorfman.

8
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,992
Hi there. Doug Neidermeyer.

9
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,709
These are our name-tag hostesses,
Mandy Pepperidge and Babs Jansen.

10
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,115
Hi there, Kent. Hi, Larry.

11
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,191
- Welcome to Omega house.
- Thank you.

12
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,556
- Nice to...
- Why don't we go meet some of the guys?

13
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,512
A wimp and a blimp.

14
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,839
There are many great guys here,
so don't feel you have to meet everyone.

15
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,558
We just want you to enjoy yourselves
while you're here.

16
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,070
Omega house has more
activities...

17
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,118
than most campus fraternities,
is far superior...

18
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,639
- Mandy.
- Hi.

19
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,909
Right there.

20
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,194
Hi there, fellows. Meet Ken and Lonny.

21
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,635
Larry.

22
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,955
Ken, Lonny, I'd like you to meet...

23
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,234
Mohammet...

24
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,549
Jugdish, Sidney and Clayton.

25
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,789
Grab a seat and make yourselves at home.

26
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,391
Don't be shy about helping yourselves
to punch and cookies.

27
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,832
I'm not going to say Omega's
the best house on campus...

28
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,956
but a lot of outstanding guys figure
they'll pledge Omega or won't pledge at all.

29
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,273
We do have more than our share
of campus leaders...

30
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,193
something that never looks bad
on your permanent record.

31
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,315
Sure. Everybody says
Omega's the best, but...

32
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,638
I hate to seem...

33
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,589
you know, pushy.

34
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,593
Let the unacceptable candidates worry,
because after tonight, they're...

35
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,832
...you are... Kent!

36
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm Greg Marmalard,
president of Omega House.

37
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,070
Meet my friends, Mandy Pepperidge...

38
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,239
We already met.

39
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,396
And Chip Diller.
How are you?

40
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,469
How are you?

41
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,039
Over there is Terry Auerback,
captain of the swim team.

42
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,873
<i>That's Carl Phillips,</i>
<i>editor of the</i> Daily Faberian.

43
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,949
And...

44
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,109
Clayton.

45
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,674
Sidney.

46
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,269
Jugdish, Mohammet, Lonny...

47
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,709
- We already met.
- Super!

48
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,710
Then you'll have lots to talk about.

49
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,039
- I don't think you're trying very hard.
- I hate this.

50
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,229
No sweat. My brother Fred was a Delta.
That makes me a legacy.

51
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,518
They have to take me. It's their law.
Don't worry. I'll put in a good word for you.

52
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,353
Great. I heard Delta's
the worst house on campus.

53
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,748
Excuse me, sir. Is this the Delta house?

54
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,069
Sure.

55
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,634
Come on in.

56
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,988
Grab a brew.

57
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,993
Don't cost nothing.

58
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,948
See you later.

59
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,074
And bump you $20.

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,754
Hi, guys.

61
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,798
You guys playing cards?

62
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,832
You want another beer?

63
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,469
Hi.

64
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,037
- You want a beer, Larry?
- Sure.

65
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,993
Nice fish.

66
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,877
- I'm Robert Hoover, chapter president.
- Hi, Robert.

67
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,157
Have you seen Boon?
He disappeared when we got here.

68
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,356
He's probably upstairs talking to Otter.

69
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,669
No doubt.

70
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,116
They're well-known homosexuals.

71
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,149
Have another beer. She's just kidding.

72
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,239
Right, Bluto?

73
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,678
You going out tonight, Otter?

74
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,075
Norma?

75
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,229
No. Let me give you a hint.
She's got a couple of major-league yabos.

76
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,992
Beverly!
No.

77
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,553
<i>But you're getting warmer.</i>

78
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,473
<i>Let me give you another hint.</i>
<i>Does this ring a bell?</i>

79
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,599
- "Oh, God. Oh, God!"
- Marlene.

80
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,435
You're going to pork Marlene Desmond?

81
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,268
- Pork?
- You're gonna hump her brains out.

82
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,789
I anticipate a deeply religious experience.

83
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,038
Why the interest in my social life?
Where's Katy?

84
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,555
Downstairs, pissed off about something.

85
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,756
She thinks you're an immature jerk?

86
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,829
Yeah.

87
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,271
I don't take anything seriously.

88
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,311
She'll take this seriously.

89
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,794
Try it.

90
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,235
- You guys coming down?
- This thing talk?

91
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,596
There are 50 people
trying to get into this fraternity.

92
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,559
Otter, you are the rush chairman.
You should be present at the rush party.

93
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,431
Hi. My name is Kent Dorfman.

94
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,549
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

95
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,154
D- Day!

96
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,792
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

97
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,358
That was Eric Stratton.
He was damn glad to meet you.

98
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,195
Larry, I see you've met D-Day.
You're having a nice time. That's good.

99
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,309
Eric Stratton. Damn glad to meet you.

100
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,118
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice tie!

101
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,351
Is that a clip-on?
Boon, come check this out.

102
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,596
Excuse me. Pardon me.

103
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,314
Ninety percent rayon! Very nice.

104
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,148
Hi, boys. Having a good time, I hope?

105
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,232
Excuse me.

106
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,390
- Did your mother buy that?
- Yes.

107
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,029
Kent is a legacy, Otter.
His brother was a '59. Fred Dorfman.

108
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,953
He said legacies
get asked to pledge automatically.

109
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,230
Usually, unless the pledge in question
is a real closet case, like Fred.

110
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,271
- My brother.
- Kent, come over here.

111
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,271
- I liked the tie.
- Great tie.

112
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,549
Katy.

113
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,392
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

114
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,389
Katy!

115
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,678
- Where are you going?
- Home.

116
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,877
- We just got here!
- No, you just got here.

117
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,953
I've been downstairs entertaining some kid
from Pig's Knuckle, Arkansas.

118
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,351
Maybe we could drive
to your folks' place this weekend.

119
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,273
Fabulous.

120
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,673
My car filled with your beer buddies going
up to empty my parents' liquor cabinet?

121
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,990
<i>It's too depressing to think about.</i>

122
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,471
Just you and me, and Otter and another girl.

123
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,839
Is this what you're going to do
for the rest of your life?

124
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,273
What do you mean?

125
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,472
Hanging around with animals,
getting drunk every weekend?

126
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,669
No.

127
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,313
After I graduate...

128
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,955
I'm going to get drunk every night.

129
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,270
I think I'm in love with a retard.

130
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,959
Is he bigger than me?

131
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,874
Greg...

132
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,392
what is the worst fraternity on this campus?

133
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,434
That would be hard to say, sir.
They're each outstanding in their own way...

134
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,751
Cut the horseshit, son.
I've got their disciplinary files here.

135
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,710
Who dumped a whole truckload of fizzies
into the swim meet?

136
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,236
Who delivered the medical-school cadavers
to the alumni dinner?

137
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,275
Every Halloween,
the trees are filled with underwear.

138
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,031
Every spring, the toilets explode.

139
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,996
You're talking about Delta, sir.

140
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,796
Of course I'm talking about Delta,
you twerp!

141
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,237
This year, it's gonna be different.

142
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,632
This year we'll grab the bull by the balls...

143
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,188
and kick those punks off campus!

144
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,836
What do you intend to do, sir?
Delta's already on probation.

145
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,478
They are?
Yes, sir.

146
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,229
Oh...

147
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,711
Then as of now,
they're on double secret probation!

148
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,075
Double secret probation, sir?

149
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,995
There is a little-known codicil
in the Faber College Constitution...

150
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,477
which gives the Dean
unlimited power to preserve order...

151
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,636
in time of campus emergency.

152
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,749
Find me a way to revoke Delta's charter.

153
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,877
You live next door.

154
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,153
Put Neidermeyer on it.
He's a sneaky little shit just like you, right?

155
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,315
The time has come for someone
to put his foot down.

156
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,275
And that foot is me.

157
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,074
Larry Kroger. All in favour.

158
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,273
We need the dues.

159
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,433
Good. Larry Kroger is now a pledge
to Delta. Next slide, please.

160
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,317
Just a minute! Just settle down!

161
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,318
This is Kent Dorfman.
He's a legacy from Harrisburg.

162
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,838
Now wait a minute!

163
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,470
Okay, this guy is a real zero. That's true.

164
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,868
Think back to when you were freshmen.

165
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,472
Boon, you had a face
like a pepperoni pizza, right?

166
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,675
<i>And Stork here. Everybody thought</i>
<i>that Stork was brain damaged.</i>

167
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,158
<i>I myself was so obnoxious...</i>

168
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,749
the seniors beat me up once a week.

169
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,080
So this guy is a total loser?

170
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,551
Let me tell you the story of another loser.

171
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,753
Get up!

172
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,711
Let's go! On your feet!

173
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,638
"I..." State your name.

174
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,229
I... state your name.

175
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,194
"...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat."

176
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,472
...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat.

177
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,355
"With liberty and fraternity for all."

178
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,033
Amen.

179
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,673
Sergeant at Arms...

180
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,959
do your duty.

181
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,116
From now on,
your Delta Tau Chi name is Weasel.

182
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,838
From now on your name is Mothball.

183
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,154
Kroger, your Delta Tau Chi name is Pinto.

184
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,232
- Why Pinto?
- Why not?

185
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,470
What's my Delta Tau Chi name?

186
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,439
Dorfman, I've given this a lot of thought.

187
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,639
From now on...

188
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,992
your name is Flounder.

189
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,153
Flounder?

190
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,951
<i>We now consecrate</i>
<i>the bond of obedience.</i>

191
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,396
<i>Assume the position.</i>

192
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,030
Thank you, sir. May I have another?

193
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,870
<i>Thank you, sir. May I have another?</i>

194
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,355
Thank you, sir. May I have another?

195
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,752
Now, what can we say...

196
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,392
of John Milton's...

197
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,959
<i>Paradise Lost?</i>

198
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,350
<i>It's a long poem, written...</i>

199
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,991
<i>a long time ago, and I'm sure...</i>

200
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,360
<i>a lot of you have difficulty understanding...</i>

201
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,716
<i>exactly what Milton was trying to say.</i>

202
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,355
<i>Certainly we know that he was trying to...</i>

203
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,194
describe the struggle
between good and evil, right?

204
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,149
<i>Okay.</i>

205
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,592
The most intriguing character,
as we all know from our reading, was...

206
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,789
Satan.

207
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,036
Now was Milton trying to tell us...

208
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,079
that being bad was more fun
than being good?

209
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,509
Okay.

210
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,351
Don't write this down,
but I find Milton probably...

211
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,990
as boring as you find Milton.

212
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,635
Mrs. Milton found him boring, too.

213
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,957
He's a little bit long-winded...

214
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,916
he doesn't translate very well into
our generation, and his jokes are terrible.

215
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,314
<i>But that doesn't relieve you</i>
<i>from your responsibility for this material.</i>

216
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,834
I'm waiting for reports from some of you.

217
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,637
I'm not joking! This is my job.

218
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,878
Come on, Mandy, I would tell you.

219
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,232
Are you and Greg doing the dirty deed?

220
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,319
Greg doesn't believe
in premarital intercourse.

221
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,109
Too bad.

222
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,114
I think he's just dreamy.

223
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,957
And one, two, three, four...

224
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,592
Company, halt!

225
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,593
Dress that line.

226
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,598
<i>Dress that line, mister!</i>

227
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,118
<i>Dress that line, soldier.</i>

228
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,151
Mister, hold my mount.

229
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,753
<i>You fat, disgusting slob!</i>

230
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,550
You're a goddamned disgrace!

231
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,431
A vicious mother, isn't he?

232
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,191
He can't do that to our pledges.

233
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,475
Only we can do that to our pledges.

234
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,753
Redo those buttons!

235
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,878
Dress that belt buckle!

236
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,919
Straighten that cap!

237
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,838
<i>And goddamn it, tuck up those pyjamas!</i>

238
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,674
Attention! Eyes front!

239
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,753
What's that on your chest, mister?

240
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,039
- It's a pledge pin, sir.
- A pledge pin!

241
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,515
On your uniform?

242
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,715
Hooked it. Shit.

243
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,997
Just tell me, mister,
what fraternity would pledge...

244
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,872
a man like you?

245
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,278
It's a Delta pin, sir.

246
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,673
Slice!

247
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,878
Report to the stable tonight
and every night at 1900 hours.

248
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,996
Without that pledge pin!

249
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,431
Do you understand?

250
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,791
Your left arm is straight...

251
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,834
but you're not keeping your head down.

252
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,350
You're all worthless and weak!

253
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,550
Now drop and give me 20!

254
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,038
Get back in ranks!

255
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,396
Always try to hit through the ball.

256
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,957
I've gotta work on my game.

257
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,319
Don't think of it as work.
The whole point is just to enjoy yourself.

258
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,395
I want you to fix Pinto up,
but it has to be a very special girl.

259
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,389
She should be decent-looking,
but we'll trade looks for...

260
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,353
a certain kind of morally casual attitude.

261
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,916
Somebody he can screw on the first date.

262
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,470
Well put. You see, Pinto's never been laid.
What did I say?

263
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,869
Don't embarrass me in front of Dave.
He's the only professor I like.

264
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,590
Mr. Jennings is a wonderful teacher.

265
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,828
Teaching pays the rent till I finish my novel.

266
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,035
How long have you been working on it?

267
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,833
Four and a half years.

268
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,433
Must be very good.

269
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,113
It's a piece of shit.

270
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,995
Would anybody like to smoke some pot?

271
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,115
Yeah.

272
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,271
You ever smoked before?

273
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,069
Sure.

274
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,791
When did you ever smoke pot?

275
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,753
I've done a lot of things
you don't know about.

276
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,198
I won't go schizo, will I?

277
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,476
There's a distinct possibility.

278
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,714
Is this right?

279
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,672
Try not to drool quite so much
on the end of it.

280
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,514
<i>Hey, Paula</i>

281
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,514
<i>I wanna marry you</i>

282
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,194
<i>Hey, Paula</i>

283
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,276
<i>Nobody else could ever do</i>

284
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,117
<i>I've waited so long</i>

285
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,035
<i>For school to be through</i>

286
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,912
<i>I can't wait no more for you</i>

287
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,869
Okay.

288
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,279
That means that...

289
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,909
our whole solar system...

290
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,078
could be, like...

291
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,876
one tiny atom in the fingernail
of some other giant being.

292
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,152
This is too much!

293
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,039
That means...

294
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,837
- one tiny atom in my fingernail could be...
- Could be one little...

295
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,515
tiny universe.

296
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,395
Could I buy some pot from you?

297
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,513
Give me that.

298
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,873
Yeah, baby.

299
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,195
Good baby. It's all right. You stupid...

300
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,989
Dorfman! What kind of man
hits a defenceless animal?

301
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,674
<i>I've got a good mind to smash your fat face.</i>

302
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,590
<i>Listen up, you nauseating pile of blubber.</i>

303
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,350
Your days are numbered at Faber.
You and all your sick Delta buddies.

304
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,120
Meantime, your ass belongs to me.

305
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,115
<i>Now, drop and give me 20.</i>

306
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,309
But...

307
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,074
Hit it!

308
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,597
Trooper, baby.

309
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,594
Come here, baby.

310
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,633
<i>Cutie-pie.</i>

311
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,434
<i>I want these quarters standing tall</i>
<i>by 0900 tomorrow.</i>

312
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,915
You got that?
Yes, sir.

313
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,670
Brother D-Day, brother Bluto.

314
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,078
You hate that ying-yang?

315
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,391
- Who?
- Neidermeyer. You hate his guts?

316
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,593
- I guess so.
- You guess so?

317
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,796
Yes, I hate him! I hate his guts!

318
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,236
We have an old saying in Delta.

319
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,709
"Don't get mad, get even."

320
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,554
Nice horsey. Good. Let's go.

321
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,433
He's in there!

322
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,591
Boy, is this great!

323
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,158
Now finish it, Flounder.

324
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,076
Are you kidding?
I never shot anything before in my life.

325
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,352
- I thought you hated Neidermeyer's guts.
- I do.

326
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,718
And the horse? Is there anything in
the world you hate as much as that horse?

327
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,713
Get it over with.

328
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,636
- Just blanks, right?
- Right.

329
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,350
- Holy shit!
- There were blanks in that gun!

330
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,037
- I didn't even point the gun at him!
- Holy shit!

331
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,958
There were blanks.

332
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,237
- Maybe he had a heart attack.
- Holy shit!

333
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,113
If you want the homecoming parade
in my town...

334
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,993
you have to pay.

335
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,149
Carmine, I think it's wrong
to extort money from the college.

336
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,509
Look...

337
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,192
as the mayor of Faber,
I've got big responsibilities.

338
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,790
<i>These parades are very expensive.</i>

339
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,759
<i>You're using my police...</i>

340
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,673
<i>my sanitation people, my free Oldsmobiles.</i>

341
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,276
If you mention extortion again...

342
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,237
I'll have your legs broken.

343
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,631
I'm sure I can arrange a nice honorarium
from the student fund.

344
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,759
Another thing.

345
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,638
You better sit
on that zoo fraternity of yours.

346
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,189
I don't want no drunken riots in my town.

347
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,875
Don't worry. I've got those boys
just where I want them.

348
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,471
We'll have the best homecoming parade
Faber's ever had.

349
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,109
Mandy!

350
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,674
- I haven't seen you since we...
- Go away.

351
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,031
I can only stay a minute.

352
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,833
Let me buy you lunch.

353
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,478
You've got your lunch.
How about some milk?

354
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,918
You got your milk, too.

355
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,149
Can I just massage your thighs
while you eat?

356
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,798
Do I have to leave?

357
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,633
Is this any way to treat an intimate friend?

358
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,996
I asked you never to speak to me again.
Will you go away?

359
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,198
I do hope we're not interrupting anything.

360
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,229
If you must know...

361
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,311
- Eric was just leaving.
- I wasn't.

362
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,471
I could make you leave, if you...

363
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,789
Bluto!

364
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,310
I think you know everybody here.

365
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,839
Greg, can't you...

366
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,992
Don't worry. Just keep your hands and feet
away from his mouth.

367
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,240
Don't you have any respect for yourself?

368
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,835
This is absolutely gross!

369
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,879
That boy is a P-l-G, pig!

370
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,719
See if you can guess...

371
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,513
what I am now.

372
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,351
I'm a zit. Get it?

373
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,035
All right, you bastard. Let's go, right here!

374
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,351
Why don't we go out tonight?

375
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,193
Don't flatter yourself. It wasn't that great.

376
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,952
Food fight!

377
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,229
Oh, Greg.

378
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,237
<i>Look. It's a star.</i>

379
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,073
<i>Let's make a wish.</i>

380
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,598
- "Star light, star bright..."
- Wait a minute. That's not a star.

381
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,679
It's moving too fast.

382
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,638
It's probably a 707. Those babies really
can move across the sky.

383
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,870
Is anything happening yet? My arm's tired.

384
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,759
I'm sorry, Mandy.

385
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,790
That thing with the Deltas
has me a little distracted.

386
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,549
God knows how they've molested women.

387
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,119
Anything?

388
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,671
Maybe a little faster.

389
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,355
Yeah.

390
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,476
- How's that?
- Yes.

391
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,720
That Eric Stratton's lucky he's not in jail.

392
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,873
I'll say.

393
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,675
What?

394
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,039
You'll say what?

395
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,428
I'll say what?

396
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,397
You said, "I'll say," when I said,
"He should be in jail." I'm trying to figure...

397
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,994
If you're not even going to try,
I'm going to stop.

398
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,749
Mandy, I...

399
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,035
- Good night, Greg.
- Good night, Mandy.

400
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,830
She stole your boyfriend?
Her boyfriend.

401
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,079
And not your boyfriend?

402
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,197
Speaking of boyfriends,
how was your date with Greg?

403
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,833
<i>Good night.</i>

404
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,795
That's it.

405
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,673
She broke our date.

406
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,910
- Washing her hair?
- Dead mother.

407
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,398
We're in trouble.

408
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,479
The Jewish guys said
our test answers were wrong.

409
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,278
Every one?

410
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,109
Those assholes must have stolen
the wrong fucking exam!

411
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,590
God, look what just creeped in.

412
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,798
Well, well, well.

413
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,830
<i>Looks like somebody forgot</i>
<i>there's a rule against alcoholic beverages...</i>

414
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,831
in fraternities on probation.

415
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,354
What a tool!

416
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,793
What was that?

417
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,314
I said...

418
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,753
what a shame...

419
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,077
that a few bad apples
have to spoil a good time...

420
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,311
- for everyone by breaking the rules.
- Put a sock in it...

421
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,313
or you'll be out like shit through a goose.

422
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,389
Yes, sir.

423
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,640
Have you boys seen
your grade point average yet?

424
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,632
- Have you?
- I have, sir. It's a little below par...

425
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,029
It's more than a little below par.

426
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,879
It stinks!

427
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,469
It's the lowest on campus.
It's the lowest in Faber history.

428
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,629
Well, sir...

429
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,996
we're hoping that our midterm grades
will help our average.

430
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,594
Laugh now...

431
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,996
because you clowns have been
on double secret probation all semester.

432
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,999
- Double secret probation?
- That means one more slip-up...

433
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,633
one more mistake...

434
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,478
and this fraternity of yours has had it...

435
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,234
at Faber.

436
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,948
That was pleasant. Nice of him to stop by.

437
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,556
We must do something. He's serious this
time. I think he knows about the exams.

438
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,108
- He's right.
- You're right. We got to do something.

439
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,031
- Absolutely.
- Know what we gotta do?

440
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,269
Toga party.

441
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,679
We're on double secret probation.
We can't afford to have a toga party.

442
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,275
- You guys up for a toga party?
- Toga! Toga!

443
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,517
- They like the idea.
- Otter, please don't do this.

444
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,918
I've got news for you, pal. They're
going to nail us, no matter what we do.

445
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,552
So we might as well have a good time.

446
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,395
Toga! Toga! Toga!

447
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,158
It's not going to be an orgy.
It's a toga party.

448
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,039
Honestly, you're 21 years old.
In six months, you graduate.

449
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,671
Tomorrow night, you'll wrap yourself in a
sheet, pour grain alcohol all over your head.

450
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,912
- Cute, but I think I'll pass this time.
- Want me to go alone?

451
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,789
I don't want you to go at all.

452
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,792
It's a fraternity party.

453
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,760
I'm in the fraternity. How can I miss it?

454
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,789
I'll write you a note.
I'll say you're too well to attend.

455
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,395
It's funny.

456
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,195
Very funny.

457
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,073
Where did he get the wheels?
From his brother.

458
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,037
He's letting him use it for a week.

459
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,839
<i>Flounder's bringing his girlfriend up</i>
<i>for the weekend.</i>

460
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,473
I am appointing you...

461
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,313
pledge representative
to the social committee.

462
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,509
Gee, thanks!

463
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,078
What do I do?
Drive us to the Food King!

464
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,312
Food King!

465
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,193
Otter, please.

466
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,873
- What are you doing?
- Fixing your sweater. There you go.

467
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,912
Keep them under there,
and keep your sweater closed.

468
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,989
- I could get in trouble.
- That's right, so...

469
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,354
be cool.

470
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,239
Mine's bigger than that.

471
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,110
- I beg your pardon?
- My cucumber, it's bigger.

472
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,190
Vegetables can be really sensuous,
don't you think?

473
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,909
No.

474
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,596
<i>Vegetables are sensual.</i>

475
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,150
People are sensuous.

476
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,113
Right. "Sensual." That's what I meant.

477
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,116
My name is Eric Stratton. They call me Otter.

478
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,189
My name's Marion.
They call me Mrs. Wormer.

479
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,994
We have a Dean Wormer at Faber.

480
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,037
What a coincidence. I have a husband
named Dean Wormer at Faber.

481
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,753
You still want to show me your cucumber?

482
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,711
Nothing for me today, thanks.

483
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,519
It looks like you gained some weight
since you came in.

484
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,116
- It's a prank. I'm pledging a fraternity.
- Don't sweat it. I won't tell.

485
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,350
The Delta Tau Chi house is having a party
tonight, and you are cordially invited.

486
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,678
I'm old enough to be your mother, almost.

487
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,829
Besides, I have to go to the goddamn
senior honours dinner tonight.

488
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,479
Oh, well...

489
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,553
Maybe some other time.

490
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,674
Doubtful.

491
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:08,549
Maybe?

492
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,917
So if you're not busy,
you want to go to a fraternity party?

493
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,838
- Will I be home by 12:00?
- Any time you want. I'll pick you up...

494
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,391
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was going to a frat house.

495
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,993
Okay if I meet you there?

496
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,514
Is it okay? It's terrific!

497
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,558
Girls, welcome
to the Delta toga party. Come in.

498
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,477
Let me take your coat.

499
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,193
Great pair of togas.

500
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,198
Have some delicious Delta punch,
and I'll join you in a minute.

501
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,835
This is Sissy, my steady girl.

502
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,110
This is the guy I told you about.

503
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,190
You're even prettier than Kent said.
What a great dress.

504
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,952
- You two talk, and I'll get us some punch.
- Good idea.

505
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,912
He's really a lucky guy.

506
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,550
Why don't we go sit down somewhere?

507
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,879
<i>I gave my love a cherry</i>

508
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,275
<i>That had no stone</i>

509
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,199
<i>I gave my love a chicken</i>

510
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,389
<i>That had no bones</i>

511
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,357
<i>I gave my love a story</i>

512
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,389
<i>That had no end</i>

513
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,751
<i>I gave...</i>

514
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,475
Sorry.

515
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,270
- You look great.
- So do you.

516
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,510
I had to wait until my folks went out.

517
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,838
Get me some more punch.

518
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,150
I got a lot of catching up to do.

519
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,999
You want to dance?

520
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,954
Yes.

521
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,519
Yeah, Otis!

522
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,393
Gator!

523
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,751
- Mrs. Wormer, I'm so glad you came.
- Cut the crap.

524
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,154
Give me a drink.

525
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,398
- This is Hoover's room.
- Yeah? It's neat.

526
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,916
I think it's locked or something.

527
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,913
Just a minute.

528
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,274
Fuck her.

529
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,439
Fuck her brains out.

530
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,355
Suck her tits. Squeeze her buns.

531
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,158
<i>You know she wants it.</i>

532
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,594
For shame!

533
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,235
Lawrence, I'm surprised at you.

534
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,837
Don't listen to that jack-off.
Look at those gazongas.

535
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,395
You'll never get a better chance.

536
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,230
If you lay one finger
on that poor, sweet, helpless girl...

537
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:24,670
you'll despise yourself forever.

538
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,517
I'm proud of you, Lawrence.

539
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,758
You homo!

540
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,868
My fault! For Christ's sake, Carmine,
how could it be my fault?

541
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,508
One of those goddamn fraternities, I guess.

542
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,031
I don't know,
but I have a pretty good idea which one.

543
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,753
I'm gonna string them up by the balls!

544
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,831
I bet it was that Eric Stratton.

545
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,159
You know that for sure?

546
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,429
No, but...

547
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,918
you'd be surprised
at some of the girls he's had.

548
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,278
Very surprised.

549
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,512
It must have been some party.

550
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,751
Unbelievable. A new low. I'm so ashamed.

551
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,599
Almost sorry I missed it.

552
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:19,753
- What did you do, human sacrifice?
- No, just some harmless fun.

553
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,752
Buy me a dinner tonight?

554
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,437
Can't tonight. Busy.

555
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,273
Busy tonight?

556
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,118
Please take your seats.

557
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,830
<i>This meeting of the disciplinary council</i>
<i>will now come to order.</i>

558
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,272
We'll waive minutes and proceed directly
with charges against Delta Tau Chi.

559
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,393
<i>Sergeant at Arms.</i>

560
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,830
The following charges are brought:

561
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,872
First, that the Delta house
did knowingly violate...

562
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,269
the rules governing pledge recruitment...

563
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:25,396
by serving alcohol to freshmen
during pledge week...

564
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,239
and after established drinking hours.

565
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,273
I'd like to address these charges
one at a time, if I may.

566
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,755
You'll get your chance, smart guy.

567
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,154
Get on with it.

568
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,748
Second, that for the fifth
consecutive semester...

569
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,310
Delta has achieved
a deficient aggregate grade point average.

570
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,675
Half the houses didn't make grades.

571
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,593
You will speak when you're told to,
and not before!

572
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,309
<i>Read.</i>

573
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,589
Third...

574
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:57,200
that the Delta fraternity routinely provided
dangerous narcotic diet pills...

575
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,679
- to its members during...
- That's not true!

576
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,034
Not another word!

577
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,918
...during midterm examination week.

578
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,309
And most recently...

579
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,793
that a Roman toga party was held...

580
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,432
from which we have received...

581
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,115
two dozen reports
of individual acts of perversion...

582
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,351
so profound and disgusting...

583
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,233
that decorum prohibits listing them here.

584
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,154
These are the charges
as recorded this day...

585
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,959
15 November, 1962.

586
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,958
Faithfully submitted...

587
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,911
Douglas C. Neidermeyer...

588
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,879
Sergeant at Arms.

589
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,669
- Well done.
- Robert Hoover will speak for Delta house.

590
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,869
I don't think you can
fully judge a fraternity...

591
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,475
without looking at the positive qualities
of the people in it.

592
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,109
<i>The Delta house has a long tradition</i>
<i>of existence to its members...</i>

593
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,151
and to the community at large.

594
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,116
We've heard enough, Mr. Chairman.

595
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,839
- I was told I'd have a chance to...
- That's enough.

596
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,832
The court will now decide.

597
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,310
- You said...
- He said that's it! Are you deaf?

598
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,637
Let's finish this damn thing.

599
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,709
Blow job!

600
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,908
- I don't think it's fair!
- I'll tell you what's fair and what's not!

601
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,149
Eat me!

602
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,595
- Tell those assholes to shut up.
- Shut up, assholes!

603
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,758
- Do we have to listen to this?
- Point of parliamentary procedure.

604
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,276
- Don't screw around. They're serious.
- Take it easy, I'm in prelaw.

605
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,590
- Thought you're premed?
- What's the difference?

606
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,240
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be brief.

607
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,958
What do you think he's up to?

608
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,556
The issue here is not
whether we broke a few rules or...

609
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,918
took a few liberties
with our female party guests.

610
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,509
We did.

611
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,673
<i>But you can't hold a whole fraternity</i>
<i>responsible for the behaviour of...</i>

612
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,638
<i>a few sick, perverted individuals.</i>

613
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,114
<i>If you do...</i>

614
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,393
shouldn't we blame
the whole fraternity system?

615
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,468
And if the whole fraternity system is guilty...

616
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,792
then isn't this an indictment
of our educational institutions in general?

617
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,992
I put it to you, Greg.

618
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,071
<i>Isn't this an indictment</i>
<i>of our entire American society?</i>

619
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,829
Well...

620
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,070
you can do what you want to us...

621
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:48,037
but we won't sit here...

622
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,358
and listen to you badmouth
the United States of America!

623
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,675
Gentlemen!

624
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,789
Order!

625
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,789
You're not walking out
on this one, mister.

626
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,673
You're finished.

627
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,109
No more Delta!

628
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,790
You've bought it this time, buster!

629
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,750
<i>I'm calling your national office!</i>

630
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,510
I'm going to revoke your charter!

631

<i>If you wise guys try one more thing...</i>

632

one more, I'll kick you out of this college!

633
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,118
No more fun of any kind!

634
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,077
When my father was in Korea,
he wasn't flying. He was in the infantry.

635
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:55,037
He was an officer, of course...

636
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:59,078
<i>How does it feel to be an independent?</i>

637
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,269
How does it feel to be an asshole?

638
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,354
What did he say?

639
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,677
Hoover says we can't even enter a float
in the homecoming parade.

640
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,594
Some stupid zombies riding piles of Kleenex
down the street?

641
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,349
Look!

642
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,756
Goddamn son of a bitch!
I'll kill you, you scumbag!

643
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,558
<i>Jerk-off! Assholes!</i>

644
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,990
Jesus. What's going on?

645
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,072
They confiscated everything,
even the stuff we didn't steal.

646
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,558
They took the bar!

647
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,115
<i>The whole fucking bar!</i>

648
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,596
Thanks. I needed that.

649
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:03,509
Christ.

650
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,158
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

651
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,198
What are we going to do?

652
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,479
Road trip.

653
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,677
You can't take the car!
Fred wrote the mileage down!

654
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,548
He wants it back by Sunday.
Please don't take the car!

655
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,835
He'll be very mad at me!
Get in.

656
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,031
Otter, don't you understand?

657
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,357
<i>He wants it back by Sunday!</i>

658
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,793
<i>Fred's gonna kill me. This car is expensive!</i>

659
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,798
<i>I'll get in trouble!</i>
<i>We can have fun, but drive carefully!</i>

660
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,757
We won't tell anybody!

661
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,871
<i>I hear Dickinson girls are fast.</i>
<i>What should I say?</i>

662
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,269
Mention modern art, civil rights
or folk music, you're in like Flynn.

663
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,875
- You sure we have dates?
- Absolutely. What's the chick's name?

664
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,513
Fawn Liebowitz.

665
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,991
- She was from Fort Wayne, Indiana.
- I hope I score. Oh, boy!

666
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,274
Oh, boy!

667
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,150
Turn the car around. I'll be right back.

668
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,996
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

669
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,397
I'm here to pick up my date.
Could you ring Fawn Liebowitz?

670
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,639
Fawn Liebowitz?

671
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,513
Just a minute.

672
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,395
Hello, Shelly?

673
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,517
This is Brunella at the desk.
Could you come down here? Now.

674
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,588
A boy is here for Fawn.

675
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,229
Thank you.

676
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,915
- Is she coming down?
- Her roommate is. Fawn isn't here. She...

677
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:10,432
Would you excuse me a minute?

678
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,868
Evening.

679
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,909
I'm Shelly Dubinsky, Fawn's roommate.

680
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,833
I'm Frank Lymon from Amherst,
Fawn's fianc.

681
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,239
Actually, we're engaged to be engaged.

682
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,030
What's wrong with everyone here?

683
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,677
Why don't we sit down, Frank?

684
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,036
I don't know how to tell you...

685
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,271
so I'll just tell you.

686
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,153
Fawn's dead.

687
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,879
She's dead?

688
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,194
Did she put you up to this? That minx.

689
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,191
What a lively sense of humour.

690
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,679
"Sophomore dies in kiln explosion"?

691
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:21,269
- Oh, my God!
- I'm terribly sorry, Frank.

692
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,470
I just talked to her last week.

693
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,036
She was gonna make a pot for me.

694
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,790
If there's anything I can do...

695
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,671
You're so nice.

696
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,713
- I really shouldn't impose on you.
- No, really. Anything.

697
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,480
I don't think I should be alone tonight.

698
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,676
Would you go out with me?

699
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,639
I'll get my coat.

700
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,553
Could you get three dates for my friends?

701
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:13,391
Otter, holy shit! Otis Day
and the Knights! I don't believe this.

702
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,753
It feels so good to be back here
at the Dexter Lake Club.

703
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,037
We'd like to do a tune entitled:

704
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:22,838
<i>Shama Lama Ding Dong.</i>

705
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,115
So hit it!

706
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,077
Wait till Otis sees us! He loves us!

707
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,599
Oh, my God!

708
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,829
It's dented!

709
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,792
We are going to die.

710
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,470
We're the only white people here.

711
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,993
- Are you sure...
- Don't worry about a thing, man.

712
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:42,871
A double rock 'n' rye, and...

713
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,199
seven Carlings.

714
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,030
Otis! My man!

715
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,717
You girls come here often?

716
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,997
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

717
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,473
This is really fun.

718
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,312
I'm really sorry.

719
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:52,475
I know what you must be going through.

720
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,592
Would you rather be alone?

721
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,399
- What are you majoring in?
- What?

722
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:21,596
- What are you majoring in?
- Primitive cultures.

723
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,672
I need you so much.

724
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,356
I'm here.

725
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,392
Move to your left a little.

726
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,349
Good.

727
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:55,072
Where do you go to school?

728
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,470
I wonder where Otter is.
Maybe I should go look for him.

729
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,640
I used to touch Fawn this way.

730
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,879
I know.

731
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,873
She told me.

732
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,074
She did?

733
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,874
Do you mind if we dance with your dates?

734
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,713
Why, no, not at all. Go right ahead.

735
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,272
If I was in your shoes...

736
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,672
- I'd be...
- Leaving. What a good idea.

737
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,914
Compose yourself,
we got to get out of here!

738
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,318
The Negroes took our dates!

739
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:23,035
<i>Oh, my God! Please be careful!</i>

740
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,148
<i>This will cost hundreds of dollars to fix!</i>

741
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,079
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

742
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:34,869
We're out.

743
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,959
What baffles me is why
Fawn would go out with boys like that.

744
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,679
- They reminded me of criminals.
- They were horrible.

745
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,268
I think Frank was kind of cute.

746
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,116
I really felt sorry for him.

747
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,629
He started crying and...

748
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,959
What did Katy say?

749
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,600
She wasn't home.
Where could she be at 6:00 a. M?

750
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,710
- What's with you two?
- I don't know. Something's wrong.

751
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,071
Women. Can't live with them,
can't live without them.

752
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:39,750
You know where Mandy is?
She was supposed to help make tea.

753
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,269
Sure don't.

754
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,512
She said she was just
going to wash her hair.

755
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,190
That's typical. Just when we're doing
something important.

756
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,955
I hate to see her make
such a chump out of you.

757
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,359
What are you saying?

758
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:03,073
I'm saying that Mandy and Eric Stratton
are having an affair.

759
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,671
<i>But I love you, Greg.</i>
<i>That's why I had to tell you.</i>

760
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,309
Babs...

761
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,555
I want you to do something for me.

762
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,869
Good.

763
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,917
I'm outta here.
Katy?

764
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:35,948
Good luck.

765
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,709
Hey. Stop blubbering.

766
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,837
<i>When I'm through with this thing,</i>
<i>you won't even recognise it.</i>

767
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,317
Come on, Flounder.

768
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,990
You can't worry forever
about your mistakes.

769
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,954
You fucked up. You trusted us.

770
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,228
Make the best of it. Maybe we can help you.

771
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,229
That's easy for you to say.
What am I going to I tell Fred?

772
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,879
I'll tell you what.

773
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:48,432
I'll swear you were doing a great job
taking care of his car, but...

774
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,873
you parked it out back last night,
and this morning, it was gone.

775
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,038
<i>D- Day takes care of the wreck.</i>

776
01:17:55,120 --> 01:18:00,069
<i>We tell the police. Your brother's insurance</i>
<i>buys him a new car.</i>

777
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,633
Will that work?

778
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,675
It's got to work better than the truth.

779
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:09,919
My advice to you...

780
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,351
is to start drinking heavily.

781
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,753
Better listen to him. He's in premed.

782
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,639
There you go. Just leave everything to me.

783
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,399
Hi, Katy.

784
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,189
I missed you.

785
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,119
I was going to call you...
Where are they?

786
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,756
Boon, I don't know what to say.

787
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,515
Boon, wait!

788
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,828
Shit.
Must be in the kitchen.

789
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,993
What's the matter?

790
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,312
There they are.

791
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,792
Are you sure, Babs?
Why would Mandy want to see me?

792
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,118
I'm sure I don't know. You'll have to ask her.

793
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,476
<i>As soon as you can get there.</i>

794
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:27,429
Well...

795
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,398
Do you know the Rainbow Motel
on Old Mill Road?

796
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,277
Thank you very much.

797
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,829
Bye.

798
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:41,629
Teddy!

799
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,394
Did you get the Deltas' grade reports?

800
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,268
Yes.

801
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,873
I have it right here.

802
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,432
Why didn't you tell me?

803
01:19:58,640 --> 01:19:59,755
Good.

804
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,478
It's "Mr. Thoughtful"
with a dozen roses for...

805
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,629
you...

806
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,636
One, two, three, four, five.

807
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:36,239
Looks like we're a couple flowers short,
so some of you boys will have to...

808
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:41,438
Where are the other two?

809
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,314
Stratton and Schoenstein?

810
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:48,474
- We looked everywhere, sir, but...
- Never mind. It doesn't matter.

811
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,595
You gentlemen
seen your midterm grades yet?

812
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,791
They're not posted yet, sir.

813
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,314
I've seen them.

814
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:57,949
Mr. Kroger...

815
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,996
<i>Two C's, two D's, and an F.</i>

816
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,237
That's a 1.2 grade average.

817
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,148
Congratulations, Kroger.
You're at the top of the Delta pledge class.

818
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,834
Mr. Dorfman.

819
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,513
Hello.

820
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,397
0.2.

821
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:19,438
Fat, drunk and stupid
is no way to go through life.

822
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,228
Mr. Hoover.

823
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:26,030
President of Delta house, 1.6...

824
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,510
four C's and an F. A fine example you set.

825
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,598
Daniel Simpson Day...

826
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,112
has no grade point average.
All courses incomplete.

827
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,558
Mr. Blutarsky.

828
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,637
0.0.

829
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:56,236
Tell Mr. Stratton and Mr. Schoenstein
exactly what I'm about to tell you.

830
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,197
- What, sir?
- You're out!

831
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:03,434
Finished at Faber! Expelled! I want you
off this campus Monday morning!

832
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,914
And I'm sure you'll be happy to know...

833
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,158
that I have notified your local draft boards...

834
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,435
and told them that you are now all...

835
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,831
eligible for military service.

836
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:24,789
Well?

837
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,074
Well?

838
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,754
Out with it!

839
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,432
Relax, honey.

840
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,993
You know, I know, everybody knows
that Otter certainly had it coming.

841
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:57,230
I don't think the Deltas
will be giving us any more trouble.

842
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,789
Greg, honey?

843
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,835
Is it supposed to be this soft?

844
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,879
Christ!

845
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,439
Seven years of college down the drain.

846
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,714
Might as well join the fucking Peace Corps.

847
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,751
My mother's going to kill me.

848
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,348
I knew it.

849
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,951
I can't believe I threw up
in front of Dean Wormer.

850
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:29,988
Face it.

851
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,391
You threw up on Dean Wormer.

852
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:50,795
Jesus Christ!

853
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:53,474
What happened? You look grotesque!

854
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:58,078
- Some Omegas danced on my face.
- Who was it?

855
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,036
It was Greggie and Douggie...

856
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,553
- and some of the other Hitler youth.
- What did you do?

857
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,519
I don't know.

858
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,911
They're just animals, I guess.

859
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,991
Looks like I missed something.

860
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,959
You did.

861
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,475
<i>We're all officially kicked out of school.</i>

862
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,357
Wormer just got our grades.

863
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,157
They kicked us out of school?

864
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,993
That makes sense.

865
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:34,036
- What's this lying around shit?
- What should we do, moron?

866
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:36,350
War's over. Wormer dropped the big one.

867
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,516
What? "Over"?

868
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,553
Did you say "over"?

869
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,428
Nothing's over until we decide it is!

870
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,838
Was it over when the Germans
bombed Pearl Harbor?

871
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,109
<i>Hell, no!</i>

872
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:50,391
- Germans?
- Forget it, he's rolling.

873
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,550
And it ain't over now.

874
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:55,029
'Cause when the going gets tough...

875
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,949
The tough get going! Who's with me?

876
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,192
Let's go! Come on!

877
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,438
What the fuck happened
to the Delta I used to know?

878
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:24,753
Where's the spirit?

879
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,079
Where's the guts?

880
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,400
This could be the greatest night
of our lives...

881
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,428
but you're gonna let it be the worst.

882
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:42,115
"We're afraid to go with you, Bluto.
We might get in trouble."

883
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,714
Just kiss my ass from now on.

884
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:50,109
Not me! I won't take this!
Wormer is a dead man!

885
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:54,352
- Marmalard: Dead! Neidermeyer...
- Dead.

886
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:56,873
Bluto's right.

887
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,594
<i>Psychotic...</i>

888
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,678
but absolutely right.

889
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,991
We got to take these bastards.

890
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,034
We could fight them
with conventional weapons.

891
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,032
<i>That could take years...</i>

892
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,351
cost millions of lives.

893
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,752
In this case...

894
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,388
I think we have to go all out.

895
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,074
I think this situation absolutely requires...

896
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:31,433
a really futile and stupid gesture...

897
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,591
be done on somebody's part.

898
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,316
We're just the guys to do it.

899
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,599
Let's do it.

900
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,716
Let's do it!

901
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,674
Go! Go! Go!

902
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,749
Tommy?

903
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:42,909
Hi.

904
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:44,189
Hi.

905
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:45,875
I'm Larry.

906
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,036
Remember me? I took you to the party.

907
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:49,874
Wait a minute.

908
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:01,912
So how come you show up now?
I didn't expect to see you.

909
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:05,112
I never got a chance to say good night
to you after the party.

910
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,915
They almost pumped my stomach.

911
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:10,510
Can we take a walk or something?

912
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,430
- What do you mean, "or something"?
- I could get some beer.

913
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:18,675
Not tonight, okay?
Besides, you might get lucky without it.

914
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,436
Before we go any further,
there's something I have to tell you.

915
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:31,160
I lied to you. I've never done this before.

916
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,149
You've never made out with a girl before?

917
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:38,552
I've never done what I think we're
going to do in a minute. I sort of did once...

918
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,471
That's okay. Neither have I.

919
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,558
Besides...

920
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,515
I lied, too.
Yeah? What about?

921
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,592
I'm only 13.

922
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,069
Hi, there!

923
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,159
Marvellous day.

924
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,674
Excuse me, please. Pardon me.

925
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:09,876
Off that mailbox!
That's government property. Move it.

926
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:15,358
Would you hold this?

927
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,999
Thank you.

928
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,479
My kid can't see.
Can he stand in front of you?

929
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,874
No.

930
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:34,834
Hoover!

931
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,113
Where's Boon?

932
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:43,750
I don't think you should stay around here.

933
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:46,672
What are you talking about?

934
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,871
We all got expelled last night.

935
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:52,759
What?

936
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,315
Why?

937
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:57,395
Where's Boon?
Listen to me.

938
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,994
I think you'd be glad later
if you weren't here now.

939
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:15,835
May I have 10,000 marbles, please?

940
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,269
Testing.

941
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:25,150
<i>It gives me great pleasure to present...</i>

942
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,719
<i>this ceremonial gold-plated whistle...</i>

943
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:33,036
<i>to this year's honorary grand marshal...</i>

944
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,554
<i>Dean Vernon Wormer.</i>

945
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,719
<i>Mr. Marshal...</i>

946
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:46,357
<i>the streets of Faber are yours.</i>

947
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,953
<i>Thank you, Mr. Mayor.</i>

948
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,435
Let's go.

949
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,036
Sequence! Hut!

950
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,992
Faber!

951
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:49,879
Thank you, God!

952
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,230
Those guys are coming pretty fast.

953
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,079
- What the fuck's going on?
- I don't know.

954
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,995
Let's stop this now. Charge!

955
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,875
Get up, you faggots! Charge!

956
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,235
Stand up and fight, for Christ's sake!

957
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,350
Faggots!

958
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,272
Remain calm.

959
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,199
All is well.

960
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,029
Cut the cake!

961
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:34,795
