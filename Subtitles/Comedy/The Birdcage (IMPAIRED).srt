Victoria Page is dead.

52
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,523
But watch how nice
I'm gonna put it for you.

53
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:27,777
You know how she died?

54

- Supplements.

58

I don't have one on me.
Is tomorrow okay?

- Don't use that tone to me.
- What tone?

87
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:12,545
That sarcastic tone that implies you
know everything because you're a man,

00:07:12,707 --> 00:07:14,254
and I know nothing
because I'm a woman.

Starina will not disappoint them,
even in this state.

- Nothing.

Just one, okay?
One before the show,

110
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,649
and one after.
No more, so don't ask.

(AGADOR) Let's leave her.
Come on.

Why are you giving him drugs?
What the hell are Pirin tablets?

00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:46,430
Aspirin, with the "A" and "S"
scraped off.

- What a brilliant idea.
- I know.

I don't believe it!
You're shaving your chest now?

I've done everything I could
to make myself attractive for you.

123
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:11,539
I've lost and gained over
a hundred pounds in the last year.

124
00:09:12,535 --> 00:09:17,837
I've yo-yoed from a 16
to a 10 to a 16, and...

125
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,546
...you've never said a word.

126
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:24,055
Not one hint of encouragement,
not one scrap of validation.

127
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:28,807
If not for the Pirin tablets,
I couldn't go on.

128
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,688
If you don't finish making up,
I'll kill myself.

129
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:35,567
You don't love me anymore.

Oh, shit.

00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:39,563
- There's a man in your life.
- What?

132
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:40,730
I sense it.

133
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:43,946
And I saw a bottle of white wine,

134
00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:46,407
chilling in the refrigerator.

135

I only drink red.

And so do you.

There's no man.

138
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:59,966
I'm switching to white
because red has tannins.

myself on stage? I know that look.

00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:08,636
Oh, where are the couple
celebrating their anniversary?

161
00:12:10,004 --> 00:12:11,847
Mon congrats, you sweeties.

162
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:15,017
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

163
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:18,100
I may have something
to celebrate myself very soon.

164
00:12:18,263 --> 00:12:21,392
I think I have found the one.

165
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,102
Yes.

166
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:28,948
You know I hate to brag, but...

167
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:32,327
<i>♪ I knew this grocery clerk</i>

168
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,830
<i>♪ Unprepossessing</i>

169
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,412
<i>♪ Some think the boy's a jerk...</i>

170
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:40,248
(LATIN POP)

171
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:00,100
Excuse me.

172
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,892
Hello.
What do you think?

173
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:07,396
You look like Lucy's stunt double.

174
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:09,906
I'm a combination of Lucy and Ricky.

175
00:13:10,064 --> 00:13:13,443
And it's terrifying.
Get out the white wine,

176
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,830
chill two glasses
and take the night off.

177
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,575
Why you talk to me
like I'm your servant?

178
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:22,915
Because you're
our faithful houseman.

179
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:25,956
My father was the
shaman of his tribe,

180
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:28,500
my mother was the high priestess.

181
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,293
Then why did they
move to New Jersey?

182
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,510
I don't know. They so stupid.
They want me to have a career.

183
00:13:34,672 --> 00:13:39,143
Hello? A career? When you gonna
let me audition for you again?

184
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,270
When you have talent.

185
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,523
Now take off the wig
or I'll tell Albert you wore it.

186
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:47,899
You do that, I'm gonna tell him you're
seeing someone while he's on stage.

187
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,273
I have two words for you: Green Card.

188
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,484
Now go! And leave
the front door unlocked.

189
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:57,450
You're such a beast to everybody.

190
00:13:58,321 --> 00:13:59,743
Come on, Gloria.

191
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:35,529
Hey.

192
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,787
You keep getting better looking.

193
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,751
Thank you. So do you.

194
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:51,041
Oh, no. Really?

195
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,134
I feel bloated.

196
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:58,640
- You think I look good?
- You look great.

197
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,220
That's very sweet.

198
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:05,638
I'm glad you cut your hair.

199
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:09,609
- Did you eat?
- Yes.

200
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:10,814
Something to drink?

201
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:14,902
- Beer, if you have it.
- I do not. Talk about bloat.

202
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:17,071
White wine.

203
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,697
Swell.

204
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:22,413
- How long has Albert been on?
- He just went on.

205
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,497
I gave Agador the night off.

206
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,377
So we're all alone.

207
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,791
As requested.

208
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,632
Since when do you like beer?

209
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:40,715
So, I have something to tell you.

210
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:44,056
But I don't want you
to get how you get.

211
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:45,641
Oh, God.

212
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,432
I'm getting married.

213
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,735
I didn't want to tell you
over the phone.

214
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:59,693
It's a girl.
I met her at school.

215
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:03,830
It's this wonderful...
Are you upset?

216
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:05,456
Let me tell you why.

217
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,456
First, you're only 20.

218
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:10,871
Pop, I know I'm young.

219
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:16,464
But... you've always said I was
a very level-headed guy. And I am.

220
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:21,097
I have job offers, I know what I want.
And I have an incredible role model.

221
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:22,427
- Oh, please.
- It's true.

222
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,309
I'm the only guy in my fraternity
who isn't from a broken home.

223
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:27,766
Stop flattering me.
It's cheap.

224
00:16:32,975 --> 00:16:34,227
Is it all right, Dad?

225
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,112
Does it matter?

226
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,364
Of course it does.

227
00:16:38,523 --> 00:16:41,743
Say it's okay, before Albert
arrives and starts screaming.

228
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:44,987
I can't. And I won't.

229
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:46,747
This is too crazy.

230
00:16:46,906 --> 00:16:50,581
You do this, you're on your own.
Got that, sport?

231
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,622
Don't come back,
don't ask me for anything.

232
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:55,540
- I want nothing to do with it.
- Okay.

233
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:57,299
- If that's how you feel.
- I do.

234
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,837
- Fine. Goodbye, Pop.
- Goodbye, son.

235
00:17:03,881 --> 00:17:06,600
- You called my bluff.
- It was good.

236
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,851
- Really?
- Not bad.

237
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,512
I got backed off on a little bit.

238
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,727
Tell me it's all right.

239
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:18,317
It's all right. I always dreamed you
would. Just not so soon.

240
00:17:19,063 --> 00:17:21,987
Come on. Drop your bags,
stay a while.

241
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,323
Let's drink a toast
to this catastrophe.

242
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:29,490
I'm kidding.

243
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,744
It's all right.

244
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:35,038
What's the young lady's name?

245
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:36,501
Barbara.

246
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:38,674
Are you crazy? Forget it.

247
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,756
Married? You're not even 18!

248
00:17:40,918 --> 00:17:43,592
Who is this boy, Barbie?
When did you last see him?

249
00:17:43,754 --> 00:17:48,510
Don't call me Barbie. Today at two.
We've been sleeping together for a year.

250
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:51,475
Oh, God! Has he been tested?

251
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,265
- Oh, Kevin!
- Yes, and so have I.

252
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:59,354
This has to wait until after the
election.

253
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,572
Where does the young man come from,
Barbie... ra? Who is his father?

254
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:10,620
His father is in the arts.
He's on the Council of Cultural Arts.

255
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:12,374
Did they fund the
Mapplethorpe exhibit?

256
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:17,164
No! Goodness, no.
He's a cultural attache to Greece.

257
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,832
Really?

258
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,625
What the hell is that?

259
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,716
That's kind of a diplomatic post.
It's a sort of an ambassador.

260
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:28,883
What does the mother do?

261
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,302
She's a housewife.

262
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:33,267
That's so refreshing,
isn't it, Kevin?

263
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:34,931
I can't talk about this now.

264
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:36,314
(TELEPHONE)

265
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,311
- Hello.
<i>- You all right?</i>

266
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:42,777
Yes. I just told them.

267
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,192
<i>Me, too. And my father is</i>

268
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:49,909
very excited. He's raising his glass
to toast us right now.

269
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:53,075
I'm going to put him on.
Yes. Take it.

270
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:56,085
- You said his parents were in Greece.
- Dad, get off the phone!

271
00:18:56,244 --> 00:18:57,416
Take it.

272
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,960
<i>Hello, Barbara.</i>

273
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:01,669
Here's to your future.

274
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:05,086
Shit! No, dear,
that was not my toast.

275
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:07,381
I broke my glass. I'm sorry.

276
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:08,969
<i>That's okay.</i>

277
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:12,351
It was nice talking to you.
We'll talk again soon.

278
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,262
How dare you eavesdrop?!

279
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:16,681
- You said his parents were in Greece.
- They are.

280
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:22,069
You saw this boy at two o'clock today and
now he's in Greece with his parents?

281
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,855
No.

282
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,899
Greece?

283
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:30,536
They're back for the winter.

284
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:33,164
They're at their home in South Beach.

285
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:34,699
Is that like Palm Beach?

286
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:39,416
It's close. It's about two minutes
from where Jeb Bush lives.

287
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,253
Really?

288
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:00,562
Ah-ha!

289
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:02,443
- Wait.
- Who is he?

290
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:05,025
Who? Where's your little chippie?

291
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:08,282
Will you stop screaming?
It's Val.

292
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:10,322
Val?

293
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:13,868
He's asleep in his room
if you don't believe me.

294
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,118
Why didn't you tell me?

295
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,877
Surprise.

296
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:04,876
- (WOMAN) Mornin', Albert.
- Good morning!

297
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,093
What beautiful flowers!

298
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:13,256
- (WOMAN) Morning, Albert.
- Good morning.

299
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:19,263
We have nice, fresh lobster
this morning, Albert.

300
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:24,275
No, thank you, Mr. Lopez.
Not today. The piglet is home.

301
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:27,111
You want the cake delivered?

302
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:32,025
Yes, please. And remember to write
"To my Piglet, from his Auntie" on it.

303
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,192
You got it.

304
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,455
Thank you, Mr. Boynton.
I want to get back before he wakes up.

305
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:39,911
I'll just try this sample.

306
00:21:40,074 --> 00:21:41,747
Chocolate schnecken.

307
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,047
A triumph. Well, bye-bye.

308
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:53,255
Perhaps one more schnecken. Do you
mind? When the schnecken beckons...

309
00:21:55,506 --> 00:21:57,133
- Good morning.
- Not yet.

310
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:02,730
What is this, sludge?

311
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,767
Yes. I thought it would make
a nice change from coffee.

312
00:22:07,101 --> 00:22:10,321
Why don't you tell me
Val was coming, you bad man?

313
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:13,107
I would not have been
so sassy to you.

314
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:15,322
Will you put some clothes on?

315
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:17,828
Why don't you let me
be in the show?

316
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:20,661
Are you afraid
of my Guatemalanness?

317
00:22:20,823 --> 00:22:21,824
Your what?

318
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:24,369
My Guatemalanness.
My natural heat.

319
00:22:24,535 --> 00:22:26,287
You're afraid I'm too primitive

320
00:22:26,454 --> 00:22:30,004
to perform with your
little estrogen Rockettes.

321
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,385
You're right.
I'm afraid of your heat.

322
00:22:32,543 --> 00:22:33,669
(ALBERT) Here I am.

323
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:36,510
The bag lady.
Good morning, Agador.

324
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:41,056
Wash those, will you? They're
delivering the rest around noon.

325
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:42,595
Good morning.

326
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,851
My God, that beard!

327
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,229
- Here you go.
- Thank you, dear.

328
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:54,281
Turkish coffee.
Delicious.

329
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,487
See?

330
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,652
- Is Val still asleep?
- Mmm-hmm.

331
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:02,244
He must be exhausted, poor baby.
You should have told me he was coming.

332
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:06,036
I'm so ashamed of how I acted.
But how could I know?

333
00:23:07,036 --> 00:23:11,667
The truth is, you hate sharing your son
with me. You're always pushing me away.

334
00:23:11,832 --> 00:23:17,430
Oh, will you look at this shin?
It's a rag!

335
00:23:17,588 --> 00:23:21,638
No matter how many shirts I send him,
he only wears this one.

336
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,179
You look awful.
What's wrong?

337
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:25,688
Val's getting married.

338
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:28,770
Don't be silly.
I got pork roast for dinner.

339
00:23:28,933 --> 00:23:32,858
I wanted to get fillet mignons,
but they're so expensive.

340
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:35,648
What do you mean, married?

341
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,317
You know what I mean.

342
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:41,120
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

343
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,332
To some girl he met at school.

344
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:48,745
Oh, no! Oh, but...

345
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:53,215
He's just a baby.
He'll ruin his life!

346
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:55,968
We've been all
through that, okay?

347
00:23:56,126 --> 00:24:00,848
He's getting married, no matter what
we say. The less said, the better.

348
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,474
Oh, my God.

349
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:07,263
I woke up feeling so good.

350
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:11,101
Now, all of a sudden, I feel...

351
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:13,065
...(WHEEZING) so funny.

352
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:16,697
Just breathe.
Let it go.

353
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,233
Oh, you've heard.

354
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:23,451
Oh, Value! Oh, my God,
this ¡s such a shock.

355
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:26,081
I'm not saying anything.
I promised your father.

356
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:30,832
But at 20, if you throw yourself
away on some dormitory slut,

357
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:35,375
you'll be sorry the rest of your life.
There! Enough said. Subject closed.

358
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,588
Hey, hey!

359
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:40,422
Well, don't just stand there.
Give me a kiss!

360
00:24:40,588 --> 00:24:43,262
Or are you too grown-up
for that now?

361
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:45,472
Hello, Albie.

362
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:52,309
Oh, Armand, our baby is going to leave
us. And we won't have any others.

363

Not without a miracle.

<i>Abortion, same-sex marriage...</i>

369

373
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,890
<i>That's why both houses

374

It's the perfect platform.

375
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:34,146
I'm glad I got on Jackson's bandwagon
instead of Dole. Dole is just too...

376
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:35,434
Dark.

377

I mean, a cultural attaché.

Oh, my God.

Whose bed?

392
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:26,072
A prostitute?

393
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:29,455
A minor?
And black?

394
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:35,002
I don't believe this. I don't
fucking believe this! I'm ruined!

476
00:31:46,596 --> 00:31:49,395
Well, this is impossible.
Either I'm an artist

477
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:53,233

trying to get laughs.

(ARMAND)
Let's just get through it.

479
00:31:54,855 --> 00:31:58,029
(ALBERT) I have to understand
every nuance of a song.

480
00:31:58,191 --> 00:32:02,742
I have to give my all. Everyone else can
just "get through it." He's chewing gum.

481
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,456
Chewing gum helps me think.

482
00:32:04,614 --> 00:32:06,616
Sweetie, you're wasting your gum.

483
00:32:06,783 --> 00:32:09,707
Let's keep going.
And no more talking... from anyone.

484
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,292
- I need to talk to you.
- Sit.

485
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:14,174
- It's important.
- Quiet. He's rehearsing.

What is it?

491
00:32:29,806 --> 00:32:33,902
- Can you come upstairs with me?
- No. Not right now.

492
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:40,408
Did you see what he just did?
Hello, Vallie, darling.

493
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:43,992
- What did he do?
- He blew a bubble.

494
00:32:44,154 --> 00:32:46,248
He can't do that while I'm singing!

495
00:32:46,406 --> 00:32:48,249
Celsius, look, this may
be a drag show,

496
00:32:48,408 --> 00:32:52,413
but it still has be a good drag show.
If possible, a great one.

497
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:53,900
Just because you're
22 and hung...

498
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,256
I'll do this, Albert.

499
00:32:55,415 --> 00:32:57,463
- You're the director.
- Thank you.

500
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:01,297
This is a complex number,
full of mythic themes.

501
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:03,932
The woman who is singing
invented you.

502
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:07,095
You are her fantasy. Suddenly,

503
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,391
you, the fantasy, see her, your
inventor, and she becomes your fantasy.

504
00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:16,608
- I don't get it.
- Try more gum.

505
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,022
- Albert.
- I hear you.

506
00:33:18,188 --> 00:33:19,940
Thank you. I know you do.

507
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:24,199
(ARMAND) Celsius, let's
start with the premise

508
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:27,740
that when you see this stunning,
smoldering creature,

509
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:31,661
she transcends your desire to chew.
She electrifies you!

510
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:35,377
Something starts in your pelvis
and goes to your heart,

511
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:38,213
where it becomes heart/pelvis.

512
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:40,719
- Pop?
- Yes? Coming!

513
00:33:40,877 --> 00:33:42,971
What do I do?
Stand here like an object?

514
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,974
No. You do an eclectic
celebration of the dance!

515
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:50,730
You do Fosse, Fosse, Fosse! Or Martha
Graham, Martha Graham, Martha Graham!

516
00:33:50,887 --> 00:33:56,018
Or Twyla, Twyla, Twyla! Or Michael
Kidd, Michael Kidd, Michael Kidd!

517
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:59,484
Or Madonna, Madonna, Madonna!
But you keep it all inside.

518
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:04,118
Work on that. I'll be right back.
It's looking wonderful.

519
00:34:05,152 --> 00:34:06,513
Barbara's coming with her parents.

520
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:08,576
- When?
- Tomorrow.

521
00:34:08,738 --> 00:34:10,411
That's plenty of time.

522
00:34:10,574 --> 00:34:13,327
There's more. There's a lot more.

523
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:18,794
Wine?

524
00:34:19,082 --> 00:34:22,712
No. Let's hear it.
I have to get back to rehearsal.

525
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:31,186
Dad, Barbara's father is a senator,
a conservative senator.

526
00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:35,099
He's running for re-election.
And she told him...

527
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:41,313
...you're the cultural attache to
Greece and Albert is a housewife.

528
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,027
What?

529
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:47,695
She had to. He founded
the Coalition for Moral Order.

530
00:34:47,861 --> 00:34:50,910
I don't care who he is.
I don't want to be someone else.

531
00:34:51,072 --> 00:34:52,619
Do you want me to be?

532
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:56,537
No, no. Of course not.
And neither does she. But...

533
00:34:58,205 --> 00:34:59,752
Dad, he's Kevin Keeley.

534
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:01,758
Who's Kevin Keeley?

535
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:03,964
Do you ever read the newspapers?

536
00:35:04,127 --> 00:35:08,633
Of course. <i>Variety,</i> the Arts and Leisure
section of the <i>Times...</i>

537
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:11,893
What don't I know?
Are you marrying some Nazi?

538
00:35:12,052 --> 00:35:16,023
No. He's conservative,
like half of America is conservative.

539
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,400
And I'm marrying her, not him.

540
00:35:18,558 --> 00:35:20,936
- I need your help.
- Not for this.

541
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:25,073
- You've done it before.
- Lied about who I am? Never.

542
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:27,701
(VAL) When I started Edison Park,
remember what you said?

543
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:28,951
No.

544
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,990
You said if Miss Donovan asked,
I should say you were a businessman.

545
00:35:34,324 --> 00:35:36,918
You were a baby, and she was
a small-minded idiot.

546
00:35:37,077 --> 00:35:38,704
I didn't want you to get hurt.

547
00:35:39,621 --> 00:35:41,999
It's different now.
You're a man.

548
00:35:42,165 --> 00:35:43,667
I can still get hurt.

549
00:35:45,252 --> 00:35:49,052
It would mean everything to
me if you would help us.

550
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:51,342
It's just for one night.

551
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:56,434
This is insane.
What do I do, close the club

552
00:35:56,596 --> 00:36:00,066
so I can pretend to be a cultural
attache, whatever that is?

553
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:04,401
And what about Albert? How do you make
Albert into a housewife?

554
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:06,361
Well, you'd have to
send him away.

555
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:08,651
Are you nuts?
You try sending Albert away.

556
00:36:08,817 --> 00:36:13,573
We'd never get him past the Keeleys.
Dad, we have to rid of a few things.

557
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,615
What things?

558
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:18,752
Well, that, for example.

559
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,958
Neptune?
That's a classic.

560
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:23,999
And this.

561
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,963
The Kirby?
That's art!

562
00:36:26,126 --> 00:36:28,299
And how about that?

563
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:36,560
That better?

564
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:50,150
Look, it's not just
one or two things, okay?

565
00:36:50,317 --> 00:36:52,570
It's everything.

566
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:56,330
We're gonna have to tone
this down a little.

567
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:59,117
Just make it a bit more
like other people's homes.

568
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:04,711
I see. So we need a total redecoration,
so we can be more like other people.

569
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:08,339
And you're going to
have to try to,

570
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:12,096
you know, change your
mannerisms a little.

571
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:15,850
- What are you saying?
- Just be a little less obvious.

572
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:17,261
I'm obvious?

573
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:19,520

But I know who I am, Val.
It took me 20 years to get here.

581
00:37:58,468 --> 00:38:01,517
I won't let some
idiot senator destroy that.

582

I don't give a damn what he thinks.

00:40:56,229 --> 00:41:00,325
An event which, uh,
I cannot, uh...

626
00:41:00,984 --> 00:41:03,157
...which may perhaps
heal some of the...

627
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:06,664
...bad, uh, things, that...

628
00:41:06,823 --> 00:41:11,499
...Senator Jackson's demise
has made us all... feel.

629
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:14,130
Where are you going, Senator?

630
00:41:14,289 --> 00:41:18,840
Where? To our farm. That's all
I'm going to say at this time.

631
00:41:19,002 --> 00:41:22,848
- Did you know the girl?
- Where is the farm?

632
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:25,509
(MORE QUESTIONS)

633
00:42:15,558 --> 00:42:18,732
(ARMAND) Agador?
Goddamn it.

634
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:20,397
(AGADOR) What did I do?

635
00:42:20,563 --> 00:42:24,784
We're redoing the apartment
for tomorrow night. Goddamn it.

636
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:27,787
This is for the in-laws, right?

637
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:32,326
Right. We gotta get rid of everything
that's over the top.

638
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:34,623
That's a lot.

639
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,669
You'll have to get a uniform
and dress like a butler.

640
00:42:38,831 --> 00:42:41,129
No. I'm gonna look like a fag.

641
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:44,296
But you'll look like
a fag in a uniform.

642
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:45,702
(AGADOR) Don't ask, don't tell.

643
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,012
Stan tomorrow morning.
I'll get Albert out early.

644
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:50,677
(AGADOR) Where will
I get a uniform?

645
00:42:50,843 --> 00:42:53,517
I'll say, "Albert,
you must go away for a few days."

646
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,603
<i>- (AGADOR) Ay, Dio.</i>
- It'll be hard.

647
00:42:55,765 --> 00:42:58,268
(AGADOR) I got so much to do.

648
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,061
Pop.

649
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,944
Thank you.

650
00:43:04,107 --> 00:43:08,362
Do me a favor, Val.
Don't talk to me for a while.

651
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:25,553
Kevin, please,
let's charter a plane.

652
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:31,139
No. We can't get out of the car. Once
we get out of the car, we'll be spotted.

653
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,907
Howl love the sun.

654
00:43:54,073 --> 00:43:56,246
Yes, it's glorious, isn't it?

655
00:43:56,409 --> 00:44:01,757
You know, you could use some more sun.
Take a few days off. You look tired.

656
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:04,459
What do you mean?

657
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:05,922
Nothing.

658
00:44:18,765 --> 00:44:21,018
(AGADOR) Don't kill yourselves.

659
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:22,527
Who put Playboy in the bathroom?

660
00:44:22,685 --> 00:44:24,608
It's what they read.

661
00:44:26,189 --> 00:44:28,487
Don't add. Just subtract.

662
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:32,825
Please hurry. This place
has to look respectable by six.

663
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:34,739
Cyril, that's too short.

664
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:38,035
I want that nice Armani
break in the front.

665
00:44:39,452 --> 00:44:44,083
But don't just pull it. Do it down
there. I got highwaters here.

666
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:47,085
That's it.

667
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:51,256
- But you must have meant something.
- I meant you looked tired.

668
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,801
Tired means old. "You look tired"
means "you look old."

669
00:44:54,967 --> 00:44:56,890
"You look rested"
means you had collagen.

670
00:44:57,053 --> 00:45:00,057
You look wonderful.
Let's go window shopping.

671
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:01,975
No, I want to go home.

672
00:45:02,141 --> 00:45:05,486
On a day like this?
I'll buy you anything you want.

673
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:08,398
Anything?
I'll have to change my shoes.

674
00:45:08,564 --> 00:45:10,032
I'll buy you some.
- I need peds.

675
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:13,161
- I'll buy you sandals.
- Armand! What's going on?

676
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:18,325
- Why can't we go home?
- Nothing. Nothing.

677
00:45:18,491 --> 00:45:19,788
Then I'll see you upstairs.

678
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,123
(SCREAMS)

679
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:22,833
What?!

680
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:25,544
- I hurt my thing.
- Your what?

681
00:45:25,706 --> 00:45:29,552
My ankle. I don't think
I can make it upstairs.

682
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,008
- I'll bring down some ice.
- No, no!

683
00:45:32,171 --> 00:45:35,391
Why not?!
Ow, my arm!

684
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,474
My arm. I hate it
when you get hysterical.

685
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:39,853
Don't leave me!

686
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,563
What is that?

687
00:45:45,518 --> 00:45:48,488
I got it from the antique store
next door. Too butch?

688
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,865
Don't add.

689
00:45:51,023 --> 00:45:53,196
(ARMAND) Albert,
you're blocking my way.

690
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,327
Put the moose on the patio.

691
00:45:57,155 --> 00:46:00,204
(ALBERT) Don't be such a baby.
Be careful!

692
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:02,994
- (ARMAND) I can't move any faster.
- Lean on me.

693
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,287
I need a doctor.

694
00:46:04,787 --> 00:46:07,131
Don't be silly.
It isn't even swollen.

695
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,634
We should go to the emergency room.

696
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:14,423
You're overreacting. Don't be
such a baby. Just sit down on...

697
00:46:15,464 --> 00:46:17,933
(ALBERT SCREAMS)

698
00:46:18,092 --> 00:46:19,969
We've been robbed.

699
00:46:20,136 --> 00:46:24,687
Albie, no. I've just taken
a few things out.

700
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:27,022
They'll be returned
by the time you're back.

701
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:29,608
Back?

702
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:32,698
Where am I going?

703
00:46:34,817 --> 00:46:39,288
- You didn't tell him.
- What? Tell me what?

704
00:46:41,574 --> 00:46:45,579
Val's fiancée is coming tonight
with her parents.

705
00:46:45,745 --> 00:46:46,792
We thought...

706
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:51,550
We thought it would be
better if you weren't here.

707
00:47:00,426 --> 00:47:01,848
I see.

708
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:07,942
- I see.
- It's just for tonight.

709
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,353
I understand.
Just while people are here.

710
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,901
(ALBERT)
It's all right, my darling.

711
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:16,659
It's nothing.
It's painful...

712
00:47:17,777 --> 00:47:19,745
...but it's not important.

713
00:47:21,656 --> 00:47:24,785
- I'm leaving.
- It's just one night, Albert.

714
00:47:24,951 --> 00:47:26,203
The monster...

715
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:30,623
...the freak is leaving.

716
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,218
You're safe.

717
00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:46,181
That went well.

718
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:51,026
Albert!

719
00:47:53,396 --> 00:47:55,990
Albert!
Will you listen?

720
00:47:56,148 --> 00:47:59,698
Go away. I hate you!
I never want to see you again.

721
00:48:01,404 --> 00:48:04,248
My heart is breaking.

722
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:06,876
Please don't cry. It's okay.
You can stay.

723
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:09,332
I won't stay where
I'm not wanted.

724
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:12,840
Where I can be thrown out on a whim
without legal rights.

725
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:14,467
I have the palimony papers.

726
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,344
You're lying again.
This is too much for me.

727
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:20,006
Too much ugliness, too much pain.

728
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,593
Feel my pulse.
Am I all right?

729
00:48:24,093 --> 00:48:27,393
My goodness, it's very fast.
Let's get you out of the sun.

730
00:48:38,774 --> 00:48:40,617
- Waiter! Water.
- Right away.

731
00:48:40,776 --> 00:48:42,904
(ALBERT) It's the end.
I know it is.

732
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,118
No, it isn't. Just breathe.

733
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,867
Thank you, Rodrigo.
And the usual.

734
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:50,082
Right away, Señor Goldman.

735
00:48:50,453 --> 00:48:52,171
There you go.

736
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,628
Thank you. That's better.

737
00:48:57,168 --> 00:49:01,014
This is not about you.
The girl's parents are assholes.

738
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:02,515
Val is crazy about you.

739
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:04,801
Is he? Oh, that helps.

740
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,603
Oh, you're so sweet.

741
00:49:08,971 --> 00:49:10,564
That water is so cool.

742
00:49:12,683 --> 00:49:17,189
Maybe it is a bit much to introduce
me as his mother on the first visit.

743
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:20,279
Could you say I was a
visiting relative?

744
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:21,784
Val's uncle? Uncle Al?

745
00:49:21,942 --> 00:49:24,320
What's the point?
To be Val's gay uncle?

746
00:49:24,487 --> 00:49:26,455
I could play it straight.

747
00:49:26,614 --> 00:49:29,333
Oh, please. Look at you,
at how you hold your glass.

748
00:49:29,492 --> 00:49:31,870
Look at your pinky,
your posture.

749
00:49:32,036 --> 00:49:37,133
What about you? You're obviously
not a cultural... whatever it is.

750
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:39,635
You've never been to a museum
and you eat like a pig.

751
00:49:39,794 --> 00:49:44,721
These conservatives don't care
if you're a pig, just if you're a fag.

752
00:49:51,847 --> 00:49:55,977
Oh, fuck 'em. Of course
you can pass as an uncle.

753
00:49:56,143 --> 00:49:58,817
You're a great performer,
I'm a great director.

754
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:01,073
Together we can do anything.

755
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,575
Oh, Armand. Really?

756
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,657
Absolutely.
We've got five hours.

757
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,949
First, get your pinky down.
It's up again.

758
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:11,708
And your posture.

759
00:50:11,867 --> 00:50:15,246
My God! Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

760
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:18,883
Stop screaming!
I'm teaching you to act like a man.

761
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,552
(ARMAND) All right, all right.

762
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:25,055
It's a dinner party,
let's work with food.

763
00:50:26,048 --> 00:50:28,551
Spread some mustard
on the toast.

764
00:50:30,553 --> 00:50:34,228
Don't use the spoon. And
don't dribble dots of mustard.

765
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,063
You take your knife...

766
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:40,146
...and you smear.
Men smear.

767
00:50:40,312 --> 00:50:42,531
Smear. Yeah.

768
00:50:45,818 --> 00:50:51,416
Get the goddamn pinky down! Make
your fingers like iron. Stop trembling!

769
00:50:51,574 --> 00:50:54,123
Hold the knife boldly, with strength.

770
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,504
Oh, God!
I pierced the toast!

771
00:50:56,662 --> 00:51:01,509
So what? Just remember not to go
to pieces when that happens.

772
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,920
React like a man, calmly.

773
00:51:04,086 --> 00:51:09,058
You say to yourself, "Albert, you
pierced the toast. So what?"

774
00:51:09,216 --> 00:51:11,810
It's not the end of your life.

775
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:15,599
"Albert, you pierced the toast.
So what?"

776
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:19,276
Of course. There's no
need to get hysterical.

777
00:51:19,435 --> 00:51:22,484
All I have to remember is,
I can always get more toast.

778
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:25,115
That's the spirit.
Let's try walking.

779
00:51:25,274 --> 00:51:29,029
- Holding the sandwich?
- It doesn't matter. Just walk.

780
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:32,118
Down!

781
00:51:55,763 --> 00:51:56,935
Too swishy?

782
00:51:59,141 --> 00:52:00,893
Let me give you an image.

783
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,564
It's a cliché, but it's an image.
John Wayne.

784
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:07,529
Oh, God! Couldn't we start
with someone easier?

785
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,443
Come on. You're a big fan.

786
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:11,533
He has a very distinctive walk.

787
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:16,083
Very easy to imitate. And if anyone
was a man... Now try it.

788
00:52:16,242 --> 00:52:19,997
Now just get off your horse
and head into the saloon.

789
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:25,130
Nice touch.

790
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:42,685
Howdy, ma'am.

791
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,242
No good?

792
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:56,575
Actually, it's perfect. I never
realized John Wayne walked like that.

793
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:14,804
Hang on.

794
00:53:19,138 --> 00:53:21,266
This guy's a fucking maniac.

795
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:24,731
What's in South Beach?

796
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:29,699
Armand Goldman,
you old so-and-so.

797
00:53:29,857 --> 00:53:31,325
How about those Dolphins?

798
00:53:33,444 --> 00:53:34,866
Screaming queen?

799
00:53:36,363 --> 00:53:40,539
The hand goes sideways, not palm down.
I'm shaking it, not kissing it.

800
00:53:40,701 --> 00:53:41,873
Tighten your wrist.

801
00:53:42,036 --> 00:53:44,835
No, straighten it, then tighten it.

802
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:48,171
Al, you old so-and-so.

803
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:50,211
- I just said that.
- Now I'm saying it.

804
00:53:50,377 --> 00:53:52,505
Okay. Straighten, tighten.

805
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:04,059
Al, you old son of a bitch!
How do you feel about that call today?

806
00:54:04,224 --> 00:54:09,355
The Dolphins, in the fourth on their
30-yard line with only 34 seconds to go.

807
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:12,741
How do you think I feel?
Betrayed. Bewildered.

808
00:54:14,109 --> 00:54:15,281
Wrong response?

809
00:54:16,403 --> 00:54:18,952
I'm not sure.
Take it from the top.

810
00:54:19,114 --> 00:54:20,411
This is very exciting.

811
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:23,327
- It is, fella.
- Right on, amigo!

812
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:24,871
- Damn straight.
- Damn straight!

813
00:54:25,037 --> 00:54:26,630
(SPITS)

814
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:28,757
- Fuckin' A!
- Fuckin' A, right!

815
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,384
(YELPS)

816
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:33,091
Swing that by me again,
little buddy.

817
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:36,382
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Take it easy.

818
00:54:36,548 --> 00:54:38,346
You take it easy, pilgrim.

819
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:41,604
- He bumped into me.
- Tough gazongas.

820
00:54:41,762 --> 00:54:43,264
Why are you being a prick?

821
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,558
Why are you being an asshole?

822
00:54:50,396 --> 00:54:52,649
Are you calling me an asshole?

823
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:56,243
Actually, I'm talking to
the asshole behind you.

824
00:54:59,321 --> 00:55:03,076
See, the swelling's already
gone down. It's nothing.

825
00:55:03,242 --> 00:55:07,372
You were magnificent,
marvelous, very masculine.

826
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:08,881
I'm so proud of you.

827
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,667
That big gorilla looked ridiculous
when he sat on you

828
00:55:11,834 --> 00:55:15,134
and banged your head on the ground.
He didn't even know how to box!

829
00:55:15,671 --> 00:55:18,174
Thank you, Value.
You're a dear.

830
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:22,435
I'll get you some more ice.
Be right back, love.

831
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:34,153
Dad, could we hire a straight maid
for tonight?

832
00:55:34,314 --> 00:55:36,863
There are no straight
maids in South Beach.

833
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,362
And I have more bad news for you.

834
00:55:40,529 --> 00:55:42,406
I told Albert he could stay.

835
00:55:44,324 --> 00:55:46,167
You did what? Why?

836
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:49,580
Why? Because he told me
his heart was breaking

837
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:52,421
and he's my friend
and companion.

838
00:55:52,958 --> 00:55:54,460
Who will we say he is?

839
00:55:54,626 --> 00:55:55,878
Your uncle.

840
00:55:56,044 --> 00:55:57,967
My uncle?

841
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:00,428
Let's just forget
the whole thing.

842
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:04,721
Don't be so negative!
Have a little hope!

843
00:56:04,887 --> 00:56:08,812
About what? Once they see you
and Albert together...

844
00:56:09,516 --> 00:56:13,521
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I was feeling so good, and now...

845
00:56:14,354 --> 00:56:16,152
God, what a mess.

846
00:56:16,315 --> 00:56:18,534
We need a woman.

847
00:56:18,692 --> 00:56:21,616
We can pass Albert off as an uncle
if we have a woman as a mother.

848
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:24,908
Ironic, isn't it?
When you need a woman...

849
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,248
Why don't I ask your mother?

850
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,630
My mother wouldn't do it.
Would she?

851
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:35,134
- How do we know?
- 'Cause she hasn't seen me in 20 years.

852
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:40,514
No. 20 years ago, she was
a young girl, scared, broke. Now...

853
00:56:40,672 --> 00:56:42,800
(ALBERT) You can't be serious!

854
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:47,892
It's very unfair of you to try to talk
Val into this. He has every reason...

855
00:56:48,055 --> 00:56:49,477
You think she'd do it?

856
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:53,060
My mother?

857
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:57,694
Oh, my God. Armand?

858
00:56:57,856 --> 00:57:01,736
I don't believe it.
It's been 100 years. Where are you?

859
00:57:01,902 --> 00:57:03,950
I'll be there in five minutes.

860
00:57:04,112 --> 00:57:06,114
<i>I can hardly wait.</i>

861
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:08,409
Me, too. Bye-bye.

862
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:11,920
She's gonna see me.

863
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:16,007
Why don't I drop you
off at a café?

864
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:20,421
No, I'll come up with you.
I'm sure there's a waiting room.

865
00:57:33,725 --> 00:57:37,070
Hello. Katharine Archer, please.
It's Armand Goldman.

866
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:38,776
Go right in.

867
00:57:38,939 --> 00:57:40,566
Thank you.

868
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:46,785
Just sit!

869
00:57:48,156 --> 00:57:49,328
Excuse us.

870
00:57:53,912 --> 00:57:55,380
Army Goldman.

871
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:59,043
Katie Archer.
Or is it Mrs. something?

872
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:02,839
No. I'm between husbands.
Sit down.

873
00:58:04,548 --> 00:58:07,927
I've thought about
you so many times.

874
00:58:08,093 --> 00:58:12,314
Whenever I saw an ad for The Birdcage.
Are you still with Albert?

875
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:14,315
Yes, we're still together.

876
00:58:14,474 --> 00:58:16,147
And you...

877
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:18,612
...you've done well.

878
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:22,240
The money you gave me
started this place.

879
00:58:22,566 --> 00:58:23,738
You should have
gotten stock for it.

880
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:26,654
I got Val for it.
It was a fair trade.

881
00:58:27,654 --> 00:58:29,372
Is he...?

882
00:58:30,657 --> 00:58:31,749
How is he?

883
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:35,038
He's fine.
He wants to get married.

884
00:58:35,203 --> 00:58:36,796
Married? How old is he?

885
00:58:36,955 --> 00:58:39,458
- 20.
- 20?

886
00:58:41,168 --> 00:58:43,045
My God, 20 years.

887
00:58:43,211 --> 00:58:46,590
And today, for the first time,
he really needs you.

888
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,532
Shiny.

889
00:59:08,403 --> 00:59:11,657
<i>(KATHARINE ON INTERCOM) Imelda, cancel
my appointments for tonight.</i>

890
00:59:17,496 --> 00:59:22,297
I normally drink vegetable juice
during business hours, but for this...

891
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:26,930
...let's drink to Senator Keeley's
daughter and our Val.

892
00:59:27,089 --> 00:59:30,184
I haven't done much for him
in the last 20 years.

893
00:59:30,342 --> 00:59:32,515
Don't worry about that.

894
00:59:32,678 --> 00:59:34,146
I'm not exactly maternal.

895
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,477
- (POP)
- I am.

896
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:39,192
I'm very maternal.

897
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:41,570
And Albert's practically a breast.

898
00:59:49,903 --> 00:59:52,656
Do you remember the show
where we met?

899
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:54,325

Thank you. That's so cool.

Wasn't your chest smooth?

I shaved it for the show.
I wanted to look young.

It's much nicer this way,
much more masculine.

937
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,835
So much hair.

938
01:02:05,997 --> 01:02:07,874
Let me touch it.

939
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,839
What a beautiful chain.

940
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:14,222
Look how it glitters in that thick,
black nest of hair.

941
01:02:14,381 --> 01:02:15,428
Unbutton your shirt.

942
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:18,309
- Careful, it's silk.
- Let me touch that chest.

from Miami at 2O miles an hour

950
01:03:09,978 --> 01:03:13,608

I had to take the bus.

951

that stupid moose for it.

another joke at my expense.

It'll be better without an uncle.

What did you do to him?
He goes to a cemetery!

- Pull yourself together!

990

It's the palimony agreement.
I told you I had it.

It says I have the right to give you
half of everything I own.

It's safer, if something happens

1099
01:14:30,408 --> 01:14:33,878
Did you just say,
"See you in half an hour, Mom"?

1100
01:14:34,745 --> 01:14:35,792
- Was that...?
- Yes.

1101

You can't call her back.
She's in the car.

he won't come out at all.

1247
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:33,723
Excuse me.

1248
01:24:35,554 --> 01:24:36,680
Well, we'll...

1249
01:24:38,182 --> 01:24:41,106
Let's give her half an hour
and then if she isn't...

1250
01:24:41,268 --> 01:24:43,066
- (DOOR SHUTS)
- (ALBERT) Here I am!

1251
01:24:43,228 --> 01:24:45,196
Oh, please,

1252
01:24:45,355 --> 01:24:49,861
forgive me for being so late,
but traffic was unbelievable!

1253
01:24:50,027 --> 01:24:52,906
Senator Keeley, Mrs. Keeley,

1254
01:24:53,155 --> 01:24:56,034
I'm so happy to meet you at last.

1255
01:24:57,743 --> 01:24:59,996
You must be Barbara.

1256
01:25:00,162 --> 01:25:01,960
What a pretty child.

1257
01:25:02,122 --> 01:25:03,590
Come give me a hug.

1258
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:06,335
Don't be afraid.

1259
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:09,176
Oh, how adorable.
She's shy.

1260
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:11,591
How nice to meet you,
Mrs. Coleman.

1261
01:25:11,757 --> 01:25:13,225
Goldman.

1262
01:25:13,383 --> 01:25:14,555
(SENATOR KEELEY)
Isn't the "D" silent?

1263
01:25:14,718 --> 01:25:18,598
It is pronounced Coleman, isn't it?
We've had some confusion.

1264
01:25:18,764 --> 01:25:21,267
Oh, yes. Coleman.

1265
01:25:21,433 --> 01:25:24,312
The "D" is silent in America.

1266
01:25:24,478 --> 01:25:29,780
It's Cole d'Isle au Man,
or Cole of the Isle of Man in France

1267
01:25:29,942 --> 01:25:31,694
where Armand's chateau is,

1268
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:35,490
Cole d'man in Greece
where Armand's work is,

1269
01:25:35,656 --> 01:25:39,911
and finally, the vulgar Coleman
in Florida, where Armand's home is.

1270
01:25:40,077 --> 01:25:45,174
So, we never know where we are until
we hear our last name pronounced.

1271
01:25:47,376 --> 01:25:50,755
- (MRS. KEELEY) Oh, that explains it.
- (SENATOR KEELEY) At last.

1272
01:25:52,172 --> 01:25:54,391
I think I would like to hug you,
Mrs. Coleman.

1273
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:58,646
Oh, my dear child. Welcome.

1274
01:25:58,804 --> 01:26:00,556
Look at this.

1275
01:26:01,598 --> 01:26:05,148
This is our footage for the show
on Jackson. Pump up the sound.

1276
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:09,065
<i>(TV REPORTER) We're here at what
they're calling Camp Keeley...</i>

1277
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:12,531
<i>(REPORTER IN BACKGROUND)
Where you driving him?</i>

1278
01:26:12,693 --> 01:26:15,367
<i>(CHAUFFEUR)
South Beach, Florida.</i>

1279
01:26:15,821 --> 01:26:17,118
Where'd we get this?

1280
01:26:17,281 --> 01:26:20,626
Keeley's house last night.
The fat guy,

1281
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:25,290
is with the National Enquirer.
Harry Rad man.

1282
01:26:25,455 --> 01:26:30,336
Oh, yeah. My God, he's put on so much
weight since the Simpson case.

1283
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,297
This should go to the network.

1284
01:26:33,463 --> 01:26:39,721
It's so wonderful what you've done here.
Everything is so simple and uncluttered.

1285
01:26:39,886 --> 01:26:43,607
Our house is a sea of papers.
You men.

1286
01:26:43,765 --> 01:26:46,894
You're the biggest babies.
They can run the world,

1287
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,188
but can't pick out a tie.

1288
01:26:49,354 --> 01:26:52,733
I know. I can't get this big lug
to buy a new suit.

1289
01:26:52,899 --> 01:26:55,368
(SENATOR KEELEY)
Armand, they're picking on us.

1290
01:26:55,527 --> 01:26:57,950
(ALBERT SQUEALS)
Oh, well...

1291
01:26:58,155 --> 01:27:01,750
...bless them.
That's the way nature made them.

1292
01:27:01,908 --> 01:27:03,910
Maybe I'm just an old-fashioned girl,

1293
01:27:04,077 --> 01:27:08,708
but I pity the woman who's too busy
to take care of her man.

1294
01:27:08,874 --> 01:27:12,469
Hear, hear! It's so nice
to meet people like you.

1295
01:27:12,628 --> 01:27:16,258
(SENATOR KEELEY)
Our kind of people.

1296
01:27:16,423 --> 01:27:21,350
C-O-L-E-M-A-N.
There's no first name on the bell.

1297
01:27:21,511 --> 01:27:23,354
Sure? They can't find them.

1298
01:27:23,513 --> 01:27:27,768
What about the name in front
of the club... Goldman? That's close.

1299
01:27:27,934 --> 01:27:30,653
You're right.
Wouldn't that be something?

1300
01:27:30,812 --> 01:27:32,564
Try Goldman. What was it?

1301
01:27:32,731 --> 01:27:34,404
Armand Goldman.

1302
01:27:35,025 --> 01:27:38,871
It's so odd to me,
this fuss over school prayer.

1303
01:27:39,029 --> 01:27:42,203
As if anyone,
Jews, Muslims, whatever,

1304
01:27:42,366 --> 01:27:44,744
would mind if their children
prayed in the classroom.

1305
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:47,914
- It's insane.
- (AGADOR LAUGHS)

1306
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,084
Thank you, Agador Spartacus!
You may go.

1307
01:27:53,877 --> 01:27:57,256
He's very nice,
but such a problem.

1308
01:27:57,422 --> 01:28:00,346
We never know
what makes him laugh.

1309
01:28:00,509 --> 01:28:02,432
At least he speaks English.

1310
01:28:02,594 --> 01:28:07,316
We have been through more chauffeurs
in the last six months...

1311
01:28:07,474 --> 01:28:11,524
And the maids we've run through
in the last six years!

1312
01:28:11,687 --> 01:28:14,691
- Rodney, Bruno, Chuck...
- Look! You all need more ice.

1313
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:16,904
I have a good feeling
about you people.

1314
01:28:17,067 --> 01:28:18,910
Not a lot of clever books
on the shelves,

1315
01:28:19,069 --> 01:28:21,197
no fancy art on the walls.

1316
01:28:21,363 --> 01:28:22,706
Just the crucifix,

1317
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:25,663
and a lot of good,
warm, family feeling.

1318
01:28:25,826 --> 01:28:28,545
This is what Clinton missed
when he started in on school prayer

1319
01:28:28,704 --> 01:28:30,126
and gays in the military.

1320
01:28:30,288 --> 01:28:31,790
More ice for you.

1321
01:28:31,957 --> 01:28:35,177
There's an idiotic issue,
gays in the military!

1322
01:28:35,335 --> 01:28:38,680
I mean, those haircuts,
those uniforms, who cares?!

1323
01:28:38,839 --> 01:28:41,934
Mom, don't talk about things
you don't know about.

1324
01:28:42,092 --> 01:28:45,096
Don't patronize your mother.
She's amazingly intelligent.

1325
01:28:45,262 --> 01:28:47,640
- I think homosexuality...
- A lot more ice for you!

1326
01:28:47,806 --> 01:28:49,023
More for me, Dad.

1327
01:28:49,182 --> 01:28:51,184
...Is one of the things
weakening this country.

1328
01:28:51,351 --> 01:28:53,103
Really?

1329
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:56,444
That's what I thought until I found
out Alexander the Great was a fag.

1330
01:28:56,606 --> 01:28:58,324
Talk about gays in the military!

1331
01:28:58,483 --> 01:29:00,827
How about those Dolphins?

1332
01:29:04,865 --> 01:29:06,333
I'll get it.

1333
01:29:11,288 --> 01:29:16,920
I think we're skirting an issue here
that has Mr. Coleman very nervous.

1334
01:29:19,671 --> 01:29:22,595
You must have heard about
how Senator Jackson died.

1335
01:29:24,384 --> 01:29:26,728
Oh, that.

1336
01:29:26,887 --> 01:29:29,515
Yes, what an ugly story.

1337
01:29:30,557 --> 01:29:32,776
Of course, we don't
believe a word of it.

1338
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:36,063
- What do you mean?
- He was obviously framed.

1339
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:40,154
- I, for one, would like an autopsy.
- Mom...

1340
01:29:41,359 --> 01:29:43,578
That's just what
Rush Limbaugh said.

1341
01:29:46,323 --> 01:29:47,324
Excuse me.

1342
01:29:52,037 --> 01:29:56,292
The tension... it's like riding a
psychotic horse toward a burning stable.

1343
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:59,302
Dinner is going to be late, okay?

1344
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:02,465
'Cause you give me
so little time to shop.

1345
01:30:02,964 --> 01:30:05,968
Barbara's nice.
I owe it to Val,

1346
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:07,807
growing up the way he did.
It can't have been easy.

1347
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:11,769
I'm sorry to laugh at Miss Albert,
but what is that hairdo?

1348
01:30:11,932 --> 01:30:15,311
Fuck it! It's one night.
I can live through it.

1349
01:30:17,103 --> 01:30:20,733
Of course, it's wrong
to kill an abortion doctor.

1350
01:30:20,899 --> 01:30:25,370
Many pro-lifers, I don't agree with
them, but they feel that if you...

1351
01:30:25,529 --> 01:30:26,701
I'm here, son.

1352
01:30:26,863 --> 01:30:29,207
...stop the doctors,
you stop the abortions.

1353
01:30:29,366 --> 01:30:33,337
That's ridiculous.
The doctors are only doing their jobs.

1354
01:30:33,495 --> 01:30:36,339
Better to kill the mothers.
That will stop them.

1355
01:30:36,957 --> 01:30:38,925
May I see you a moment, dear?

1356
01:30:39,084 --> 01:30:43,214
I know, I know, if you kill the
mother, the fetus dies, too.

1357
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:47,476
But the fetus is going to be aborted,
so let it go down with the ship.

1358
01:30:47,634 --> 01:30:49,511
I really must see you now.

1359
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:52,226
Excuse me.

1360
01:30:59,896 --> 01:31:01,614
I assure you,

1361
01:31:01,773 --> 01:31:05,368
Mother is just following a train
of thought to its logical

1362
01:31:05,569 --> 01:31:07,492
yet absurd conclusion.

1363
01:31:07,654 --> 01:31:10,077
As Jonathan Swift did
when he suggested

1364
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,618
Irish peasants feed
their babies to the rich.

1365
01:31:13,535 --> 01:31:16,914
I don't know about Jonathan Swift,
but I know one thing about your mother.

1366
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:21,711
She's a passionate woman
who follows her heart. And I love her.

1367
01:31:23,336 --> 01:31:25,634
So Goldman owns the club,

1368
01:31:25,797 --> 01:31:29,427
lives above it, owns the
building and he's gay.

1369
01:31:30,802 --> 01:31:32,770

Barbara, Albert isn't my mother.
He's a drag queen.

That's right, I keep forgetting.

1380
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:13,725

What a lovely voice you have,
Agador Spartacus.

1387
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:48,677
Thank you. Thank you, all.
Dinner is served.

1388
01:32:48,838 --> 01:32:54,220
Wonderful. This way, Senator.
You know, I played Eliza in high school.

1389
01:32:54,386 --> 01:32:56,263
I'll bet you were lovely.

1390
01:32:59,265 --> 01:33:02,109
Go inside. I'll tape a note
to Katharine to the door.

1391
01:33:03,103 --> 01:33:06,983
Mrs. Keeley over there,
and the Senator on my right.

1392
01:33:07,148 --> 01:33:10,652
Val, over here.
And Barbara, dear, please sit.

1393
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:12,696
You are the most gracious hostess.

1394
01:33:12,862 --> 01:33:14,455
Oh, thank you so much.

1395
01:33:14,614 --> 01:33:17,117
I'm having such a wonderful time.

1396
01:33:17,993 --> 01:33:20,371
This is what I've always dreamed of:

1397
01:33:20,537 --> 01:33:24,508
a big, loving family
gathered around the table,

1398
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:26,509
the way it was when I was a girl.

1399
01:33:26,668 --> 01:33:28,548
(SENATOR KEELEY)
That's the way we grew up, too.

1400
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:33,642
(ALBERT) It was a wonderful world then,
wasn't it? Happy families and

1401
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:37,521
everyone speaking English
and no drugs and no AIDS.

1402
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:38,896
Easy on the wine, Mom.

1403
01:33:39,055 --> 01:33:40,682
What interesting china!

1404
01:33:40,849 --> 01:33:44,479
It looks like young men
playing leapfrog.

1405
01:33:44,644 --> 01:33:45,736
Is it Greek?

1406
01:33:47,605 --> 01:33:51,326
(SQUEALS) I... I...

1407
01:33:51,484 --> 01:33:53,157
...I have no idea.

1408
01:33:53,319 --> 01:33:55,617
I've never seen these bowls before.

1409
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:59,205
Really? Barbara,
get me my glasses, dear.

1410
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:01,290
They're in my purse by the chair.

1411
01:34:01,453 --> 01:34:04,673
(SENATOR KEELEY)
Where are my glasses? It is Greek.

1412
01:34:04,831 --> 01:34:09,132
Greek boys, actually.
Uh, naked Greek boys.

1413
01:34:09,335 --> 01:34:12,088
And girls!
Doesn't your bowl have girls?

1414
01:34:12,255 --> 01:34:15,850
- (VAL) I have one!
- (ALBERT) Mine, too! Oh, look.

1415
01:34:16,009 --> 01:34:18,558
There. I think that's a girl.

1416
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:22,099
Then you haven't seen one in a long
time. That's a boy.

1417
01:34:22,265 --> 01:34:25,439
I may need glasses,
but I can see that.

1418
01:34:26,102 --> 01:34:29,652
I couldn't find your glasses.
Maybe they're in the car.

1419
01:34:29,814 --> 01:34:31,908
I have mine. Here.

1420
01:34:33,818 --> 01:34:36,287
Hurry, you idiot!
They're looking at the bowls.

1421
01:34:36,446 --> 01:34:38,790
How could you put out bowls
without looking at them?!

1422
01:34:38,948 --> 01:34:41,747
Stop ladling!
Give me the pot!

1423
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:43,662
- You can't serve out of that!
- Move!

1424
01:34:43,828 --> 01:34:45,922
Wait! There's shrimps.

1425
01:34:46,081 --> 01:34:47,628
(SENATOR KEELEY) Let's see what
these Greeks are doing.

1426
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:49,919
(ARMAND) Here we go.

1427
01:34:51,586 --> 01:34:56,763
Agador's superb soup. We're in luck,
he doesn't make this for everyone.

1428
01:34:56,925 --> 01:35:00,054
This is his specialty,
seafood chowder.

1429
01:35:00,428 --> 01:35:01,805
- Isn't that an egg?
- What?

1430
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:05,475
- An egg.
- Why, yes, it is. It is a huevo.

1431
01:35:06,476 --> 01:35:08,820
This is so Guatemala.

1432
01:35:08,978 --> 01:35:11,857
They put eggs in
everything down there

1433
01:35:12,023 --> 01:35:15,493
because chicken is
so important to them.

1434
01:35:15,652 --> 01:35:18,576
It's their only real currency.

1435
01:35:18,738 --> 01:35:21,617
A woman is said to be
worth her weight in hens.

1436
01:35:21,783 --> 01:35:25,378
A man's wealth is measured
by the size of his cock.

1437
01:35:25,537 --> 01:35:27,289
Will you excuse me?

1438
01:35:30,792 --> 01:35:32,260
What the hell is this?

1439
01:35:32,418 --> 01:35:36,264
Sweet and sour peasant soup.
Why'd you say it was seafood chowder?

1440
01:35:36,422 --> 01:35:40,017
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know. I made it up!

1441
01:35:40,176 --> 01:35:41,302
God, this is a nightmare.

1442
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:47,646
(SLURPING NOISES)

1443
01:35:54,357 --> 01:35:56,485
Where are you
staying in Florida?

1444
01:35:57,652 --> 01:36:00,496
With the Jeb Bushes,
on Fisher Island.

1445
01:36:00,655 --> 01:36:04,410
Fisher Island.
Such a lovely spot.

1446
01:36:04,576 --> 01:36:08,331
My parents lived on Fisher
Island until they died.

1447
01:36:09,914 --> 01:36:13,384
I thought you were visiting
your parents in Palm Beach.

1448
01:36:13,543 --> 01:36:15,341
(DEEP VOICE) What?

1449
01:36:15,503 --> 01:36:18,973
Oh, yes, uh... now...

1450
01:36:19,966 --> 01:36:21,513
...that they're dead.

1451
01:36:21,968 --> 01:36:23,015
They moved...

1452
01:36:24,304 --> 01:36:26,523
...were moved... because...

1453
01:36:29,434 --> 01:36:30,936
Well...

1454
01:36:31,102 --> 01:36:34,902
My mother always said,
"Live on Fisher Island,

1455
01:36:35,064 --> 01:36:37,032
get buried in Palm Beach,

1456
01:36:37,192 --> 01:36:40,571
that way you'll have
the best of Florida."

1457
01:36:42,322 --> 01:36:45,292
Dad, get in there.
Everything is going to hell.

1458
01:36:45,450 --> 01:36:47,703
He didn't make an entrée.

1459
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:51,123
What? You... you mean
we just have soup?

1460
01:36:51,289 --> 01:36:54,168
Peasant soup is an entrée.
It's like stew!

1461
01:36:54,334 --> 01:36:56,007
Why do you think I
put so much in it?!

1462
01:36:56,169 --> 01:36:57,842
Shut up!

1463
01:36:58,004 --> 01:37:00,848
Put Katharine's note
on the downstairs door.

1464
01:37:01,007 --> 01:37:03,726
I have to go back before
they get to the bottom of the bowls.

1465
01:37:03,885 --> 01:37:07,355
I had so much to do.
You give me no time to shop!

1466
01:37:07,513 --> 01:37:08,685
Shut up!

1467
01:37:08,848 --> 01:37:11,317
It's okay!
We're all right!

1468
01:37:11,476 --> 01:37:14,605
Shut up, goddamn you!
Stop crying! Goddamn you!

1469
01:37:14,771 --> 01:37:18,321
Don't just stand there!
She'll be here any minute! Go!

1470
01:37:18,483 --> 01:37:20,406
Goddamn it!
Fuck the shrimp!

1471
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:29,502
Oh, my God.
That's it. That's it.

1472
01:37:29,661 --> 01:37:32,961
- That's the Lincoln.
- Park here. The street's jammed.

1473
01:37:33,122 --> 01:37:36,467
- This is an intersection.
- So? We're the press.

1474
01:37:48,096 --> 01:37:53,148
<i>"Katharine, do not go upstairs.
I'll call you tomorrow. Armand."</i>

1475
01:37:53,309 --> 01:37:55,186
This is going to be great.

1476
01:37:56,271 --> 01:38:00,777
From that day on, they looked
for a cemetery they really loved

1477
01:38:00,942 --> 01:38:02,364
instead of eating tofu.

1478
01:38:02,568 --> 01:38:05,242
Daddy favored Key Biscayne, but...

1479
01:38:05,405 --> 01:38:07,533
Time for dessert.
You get everything done?

1480
01:38:07,699 --> 01:38:08,746
Yes.

1481
01:38:08,908 --> 01:38:12,037
Shall we have our coffee
in the living room?

1482
01:38:15,665 --> 01:38:18,589
No, it's his town car.
I am looking at it.

1483
01:38:21,421 --> 01:38:25,142
We're in the middle of a bunch
of drag clubs. I don't know.

1484
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,177
We got authorization.

1485
01:38:27,343 --> 01:38:28,845
So, three?

1486
01:38:31,389 --> 01:38:34,734
- So, where are they?
- They went around the corner there.

1487
01:38:41,774 --> 01:38:46,154
So what do you think of these kids
getting married?

1488
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:50,292
Well, she's only 18
and he's only 20, so I...

1489
01:38:50,450 --> 01:38:51,997
(MUSIC)

1490
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:56,506
Good God. That sounds like
it's coming from downstairs.

1491
01:38:56,664 --> 01:38:59,264
(MRS. KEELEY) It must be coming
from that nightclub on the corner.

1492
01:38:59,292 --> 01:39:01,294
This must be the same building.

1493
01:39:01,461 --> 01:39:06,638
You're joking! I always thought
that was someone's television set.

1494
01:39:06,799 --> 01:39:09,678
Now, Mother, you know
we live above a nightclub.

1495
01:39:09,844 --> 01:39:12,973
She's travelled around
the world, but deep down

1496
01:39:13,139 --> 01:39:16,439
she's still a girl from
Grover's Corners.

1497
01:39:16,601 --> 01:39:18,695
I'm afraid I am a bit naive.

1498
01:39:20,021 --> 01:39:22,023
Don't be ashamed of Grover's Corners.

1499
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:26,320
It's not a chateau, but it's a
darn good place to call home.

1500
01:39:26,486 --> 01:39:30,707
Thank you.
I will remember that.

1501
01:39:30,865 --> 01:39:35,496
Of course, Armand is much more
sophisticated than I am.

1502
01:39:35,661 --> 01:39:39,757
But then, he comes
from such good stock.

1503
01:39:40,792 --> 01:39:43,921
Just like those two
adorable youngsters.

1504
01:39:44,253 --> 01:39:46,255
Don't you agree?

1505
01:39:46,422 --> 01:39:48,800
- Where's the bathroom?
- (VAL) I'll show you.

1506
01:39:48,966 --> 01:39:52,891
- No, I want Mother Coleman to show me.
- My dear child!

1507
01:39:53,054 --> 01:39:54,601
One kiss, darling.

1508
01:39:54,764 --> 01:39:56,937
- I'm only going to the bathroom.
- (VAL) We'll all go.

1509
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:59,899
(ALBERT)
I think you're all crazy.

1510
01:40:00,061 --> 01:40:01,153
My men!

1511
01:40:01,312 --> 01:40:04,532
(BARBARA) Isn't this wonderful?
All of us together.

1512
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:07,443
(ALBERT) This is so moving,
I think I'm going to cry!

1513
01:40:08,194 --> 01:40:11,573
Something very
strange is going on.

1514
01:40:11,948 --> 01:40:14,042
I know.

1515
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:15,702
I mean, that dinner.

1516
01:40:17,078 --> 01:40:19,831
I know there was something
on those bowls.

1517
01:40:19,997 --> 01:40:23,342
And the son disappearing
while we were eating.

1518
01:40:23,501 --> 01:40:25,924
I know just what's going on.

1519
01:40:26,087 --> 01:40:27,555
It's the oldest story in the world.

1520
01:40:27,713 --> 01:40:29,090
What is it?

1521
01:40:32,218 --> 01:40:34,186
She's a small town girl...

1522
01:40:35,847 --> 01:40:39,693
...and he's a pretentious European,
the worst kind.

1523
01:40:40,017 --> 01:40:42,111
Him and his Cole d'whatever.

1524
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:45,945
And his decadent china.
I've seen it all before.

1525
01:40:46,107 --> 01:40:48,405
Aristotle Onassis was like this.

1526
01:40:48,568 --> 01:40:51,947
And all of the French.
Especially Mitterrand.

1527
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:54,874
And the English.
Not Margaret Thatcher, of course.

1528
01:40:55,032 --> 01:40:58,957
But I bet John Major has something
on the side. And she can't handle it.

1529
01:40:59,120 --> 01:41:01,214
- Who?
- Mrs. Coleman.

1530
01:41:01,372 --> 01:41:03,466
Why should she care
about John Major?

1531
01:41:03,958 --> 01:41:06,928
No. Mrs. Coleman
can't handle him.

1532
01:41:07,086 --> 01:41:10,932
Coleman and his nasty
little European traditions.

1533
01:41:11,757 --> 01:41:15,227
And his snobbery. And that dig
about Grover's Corners.

1534
01:41:15,386 --> 01:41:17,104
Kevin, you're rambling.

1535
01:41:17,263 --> 01:41:21,564
Well, it makes me furious,
the contempt he has for her.

1536
01:41:21,726 --> 01:41:25,401
Did you see him when she talked?
He looked almost frightened.

1537
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:30,110
He won't let her run the house.
He's in the kitchen. He serves.

1538
01:41:30,276 --> 01:41:33,246
He tells that beige
savage what to do.

1539
01:41:38,618 --> 01:41:39,619
What?

1540
01:41:39,785 --> 01:41:44,416
I'm so sorry.
I've ruined everything!

1541
01:41:44,582 --> 01:41:48,337
Don't be silly. No-one noticed the wig.
Where's the spirit gum?

1542
01:41:48,503 --> 01:41:49,846
They took everything away.

1543
01:41:50,004 --> 01:41:54,009
I have a barrette. If you don't move
your head, it might work.

1544
01:41:54,175 --> 01:41:56,849
Thank you.
You're a very sweet girl.

1545
01:41:57,512 --> 01:41:58,855
I'm so sorry, Val.

1546
01:42:00,181 --> 01:42:04,607
You didn't have this kind of sympathy
