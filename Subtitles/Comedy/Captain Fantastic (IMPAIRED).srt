She had to be in a good facility.

for it as long as she was treated near you.

I assume you know
that Leslie was a Buddhist.

182

334
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:40,561
Why would a man stick his penis
in a woman's vagina?

335
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:45,316
Because it can give them both pleasure.

336

And because the combination
of a man's sperm

337
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:51,572
and a woman's egg can create a baby
and continue the human race.

Pee comes not from the vagina,
but from the urethra,

which is within the outer labia.

that is where she pees.

(STAMMERING)

501

It's a rotisserie chicken, so you buy it.

502
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:09,453
It's already dead. Or cooked. On a thing.

00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:20,714
- Ben, some wine?
- Please.

506
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,887
Dad, can I have some wine?

507
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:30,140
- Sure, why not?
- Ben. (LAUGHS) No.

508
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:31,517
Children don't drink wine.

509
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,437
In France, and other countries, children
drink small amounts of wine all the time.

510
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:37,814
It's a digestive. It's not crack.

511
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,233
What's crack?

512
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,112
Crack is a crystallized,
highly addictive derivative

513
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:45,489
of the stimulant cocaine.

514
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:49,785
In the mid-1980s, it accelerated
the decimation of inner-city neighborhoods.

515
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:52,621

just like you guys,

nothing, over their Nikes.

00:47:56,667 --> 00:47:58,544
They killed each other for Nike?

- BEN: It's not a secret.

I wouldn't say that. Why would you...

553
00:49:51,365 --> 00:49:53,200
DAVE: Well, Aunt Leslie was sick

554
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:57,663
and she had, uh,
complications from her sickness.

555
00:49:57,746 --> 00:49:58,789
Yeah.

556
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,043
She had a mental illness.

557
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,212
Bipolar affective disorder.

558
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:07,464
We think it started
right after Bo was born.

559
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:10,217
Probably a form of postpartum psychosis.

560
00:50:11,093 --> 00:50:14,388
She'd have violent mood
swings ranging from mania,

561
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:18,892
where she'd be elated and make
elaborate plans for the future,

562
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:21,770
to severe depression where
she'd become almost catatonic.

Zaja just turned eight, by the way.

673
00:57:02,879 --> 00:57:04,047
Bill of Rights.

674
00:57:04,923 --> 00:57:07,383
Amendment 1, Congress shall make no law

675
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:12,097
respecting an establishment of religion
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,

676
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:13,807

we'd be more like China.

Here, at least,
we don't have warrantless searches,

682

we have free speech, citizens are protected
from cruel and unusual punishments...

the 2010 Supreme Court
decision on Citizens United?

687
00:57:42,794 --> 00:57:44,754
Corporations have
the same rights as people,

688
00:57:44,838 --> 00:57:46,840
so there's no spending limit
on candidates.

689
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,426
Which means our country
is ruled by corporations

690

Mostly Bach.

Mainly the Goldberg Variations,
especially Glenn Gould's versions.

713

Baby and Child Care in 1947.

01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:40,485
And Mom knew that! She understood!

968
01:19:41,653 --> 01:19:46,658
Unless it comes out of a fucking book,
I don't know anything about anything!

NAI: Dad?

970
01:20:15,145 --> 01:20:16,396
You should put some clothes on, buddy.

971
01:20:29,201 --> 01:20:31,995
No, stay on Steve. I'll be right back.

- No.

974
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:40,295
Abby, I need Rell.

975
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:41,421
It won't work like this, you know Jack.

976
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:42,547
He's my son.

977
01:20:46,218 --> 01:20:47,427
All right.

- Okay, get your things.
- JACK: Just a minute, please.

983
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:03,860
Come on, Rell.

984
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:05,946
I said, just a minute.

985
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:09,533
I've clearly upset you and I apologize.

986
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:11,076
You killed Mom!

987
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:12,244
ABBY: Oh.

988
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,921
I heard you.

989
01:21:24,923 --> 01:21:26,424
I heard you fighting about where we live.

990
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:29,427
Mom wanted to leave. I heard.

991
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:33,431
Your mother and I made
certain decisions, together,

992
01:21:33,515 --> 01:21:34,849
about what was best for all of you.

993
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:37,936
I'm going to live here
with Nana and Grandpa.

994
01:21:38,353 --> 01:21:42,941
That's not possible.
Come on, get your stuff. Let's go.

995
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:46,778
Let's go!

996
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:51,199
I hate you! I fucking hate you!

997
01:21:51,283 --> 01:21:52,284
ABBY: Rellian.

998
01:21:54,953 --> 01:21:56,204
Rellian.

999
01:21:57,789 --> 01:21:58,915
(THUMP)

1000
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:04,713
What the fuck? That almost hit me!

1001
01:22:04,796 --> 01:22:06,715
If I wanted to hit you,
I would have hit you.

1002
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,049
You just shot an arrow at me!

1003
01:22:08,133 --> 01:22:10,218
You told me they were in school.

1004
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:14,306
They are.

1005
01:22:15,056 --> 01:22:16,391
Leslie and I are their teachers.

1006
01:22:16,474 --> 01:22:17,976
Are... Were their teachers.

1007
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:20,061
So you're teaching them to steal?

1008
01:22:20,145 --> 01:22:21,146
Of course not.

1009
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:22,981
"Mission: Free the Food"?

1010
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:26,568
That was part of their training.

1011
01:22:26,651 --> 01:22:28,653
So you're training them to steal?

1012
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:32,115
Their mother had just died.

1013
01:22:32,324 --> 01:22:35,827
They were in shock, they were devastated,
they needed a distraction.

1014
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,329
So we made it Noam Chomsky Day.

1015
01:22:37,454 --> 01:22:38,913
JACK: "Noam Chomsky Day."

1016
01:22:38,997 --> 01:22:40,415
I don't even know who that is.

1017
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:43,627
That's the day you gave
my grandchildren real weapons.

1018
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,546
(LAUGHS)

1019
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:48,673
How did Rellian break his hand?

1020
01:22:51,343 --> 01:22:54,929
He slip... He fell. And it's not broken.

1021
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:57,098
He was climbing
on a rock face in the rain.

1022
01:22:57,182 --> 01:22:58,767
It was an accident.

1023
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,518
And it wasn't raining
when we were climbing.

1024
01:23:00,644 --> 01:23:02,604
He has bruises over his whole body.

1025
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:04,939
Yeah, and scratches. We all have them.

1026
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:06,107
It's child abuse.

1027
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:09,194
Even if they make it through whatever
it is you're doing to them,

1028
01:23:09,277 --> 01:23:12,113
they're going to be totally unprepared
for the real world.

1029
01:23:12,197 --> 01:23:14,491
And I happen to think
the opposite is true.

1030
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:20,705
Rellian is legally old enough to choose,
and I intend to honor his wishes.

1031
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,712
This is my lawyer's card.

1032
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,299
Abby and I have decided
that we're going to file

1033
01:23:31,383 --> 01:23:33,301
- for custody of the children.
- (SCOFFS)

1034
01:23:33,385 --> 01:23:34,719
Now, I know you don't own a telephone,

1035
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:37,889
but I suggest you find one
immediately and call him.

1036
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:41,226
Because I would hate to have
to issue a warrant for your arrest.

1037
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:42,727
He's my son.

1038
01:23:43,353 --> 01:23:45,355
(SCOFFS)
I'm not leaving without him, Jack.

1039
01:23:45,814 --> 01:23:47,023
Fine.

1040
01:23:51,736 --> 01:23:55,365
Who's this? Hey, hello, Bill, how are you?

1041
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:59,327
It's Jack Bertrang from up in Coronado.

1042
01:23:59,411 --> 01:24:03,164
Listen, I think I just saw a prowler
wandering around outside on my grounds.

1043
01:24:03,248 --> 01:24:06,376
I wonder if you'd send a car.
Thanks. Yeah.

1044
01:24:08,586 --> 01:24:13,091
I hope you can explain Rellian's
injuries to the police, because I can't.

1045
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:35,739
- Yes, thanks very much.
- Sure thing, Mr. Bertrang.

1046
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:50,879
Okay, prisoner located.

DOCTOR: Mr. Cash?

1060
01:27:05,847 --> 01:27:08,516
She's got a decent concussion,
but we did a CAT scan,

1061
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,435
and there's absolutely
no damage to the brain.

1062
01:27:10,852 --> 01:27:14,397
She does have a slight fracture across
the tibia and fibula of her left leg.

1063
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,276
She's going to need a neck brace
and a cast, but otherwise she's fine.

(SOFTLY) Yeah.

There's seven vertebrae in the neck.

a tear to the spinal cord...
