1
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:36,373
"What's New in Love"

2
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,131
Every fucking morning.

3
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:47,032
- I heard that.
- No, you didn't.

4
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:48,827
- Yes I did.
- I did too.

5
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:52,997
Hey, Sandy, what the hell.

6
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:56,722
- Mom!
- It's just for germs, they're for enemy.

7
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,118
- Good luck in your test.
- And I need luck.

8
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:04,600
- {Mumbles}, Mom.
- I'm sorry.

9
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:10,215
Have a great day.
And remember, own your own power.

10
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:12,569
Powerful Frank can learn.

11
00:01:13,936 --> 00:01:15,315
Sorry.

12
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:17,865
Don't forget to bring the DVD for my birthday.

13
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,699
I told Lizzie she's not bringing it
for show and tell tomorrow.

14
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:24,812
- Do I ever forget anything?
- Just do it! Ok, Mom?

15
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:28,697
Go!

16
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:33,731
Welcome to the Frank Magic Jr.
6th birthday celebration.

17
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:36,858
- We have many famous guests.
Famous. -Well, we're here.

18
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:42,289
Cute.

19
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,613
Yeah, that's it.

20
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:20,573
Oh, Molly, Molly.

21
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:22,456
Molly Foster?!

22
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:26,082
You're a magician.
A little magician.

23
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:30,641
Doing Sandy a nice favour.

24
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,327
Molly. Yes, Molly.

25
00:03:41,827 --> 00:03:43,939
Oh, my God!

26
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:51,778
Mom I don't understand why
we have to move into the city?

27
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:57,480
The city is the centre of everything honey
It will be a fresh start.

28
00:03:57,515 --> 00:04:02,160
Dad said that only minority ventured
Capitalists live in the city.

29
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:03,761
And now we do too.

30
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:24,847
Are we going to meet any transvestite?

31
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:26,478
What is transvestite?

32
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:29,650
It is a person who has a penis
and a vagina and they live in the city.

33
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:31,851
That's not what it is.

34
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:35,167
Okay, guys, it's the place.

35
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:37,383
I really have to pee.

36
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:39,814
Can you hold it a little longer?

37
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:42,276
Welcome to New York City.

38
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:44,871
We're only here because
our parents are getting a divorce.

39
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,349
stop smiling or
I'm taking you to Oprah.

40
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:49,162
- Sadie.
- You know I've read about this.

41
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:52,646
It's fairly typical behaviour for
children of divorced.

42
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:54,829
How about taking the bags?

43
00:04:54,864 --> 00:04:58,267
Mommy, check this out! We're
writing our names.

44
00:04:58,768 --> 00:05:00,667
Oh God!

45
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:07,132
You can't move around for
the rest of your life.

46
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:11,425
It's only been three weeks, mom.
Give me some time.

47
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,661
Oh, such a smart girl.

48
00:05:13,696 --> 00:05:17,642
She never graduated college,
and you hated her.

49
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:20,735
But the French, she spoke it so beautiful.

50
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,218
She was from there.

51
00:05:22,253 --> 00:05:26,430
She was a Finklestein,
It is hard not to love a Finklestein.

52
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:30,027
Anyway, I spoke to your cousin Lou,
and she arranged a job interview,

53
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:32,897
Women's Centre, where she used to work,
Get you out of your punk.

54
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,419
I have a job,
at the coffee shop.

55
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:38,649
Oh, it's depressing and you're a college graduate,
Aram, for crying out loud.

56
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:42,521
You'll finally put that Ladies Studies
major of yours to good use.

57
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:45,776
It's a minor, Dad
and it's called sociology.

58
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,764
BA from Stanford
Journalism from North western.

59
00:05:49,865 --> 00:05:53,389
You do realize that it's
just a stat checking job?

60
00:05:53,624 --> 00:05:57,076
I've been raising two kids, and

61
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:01,627
I'm divorced.

62
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:06,904
And I'm sure I'll be good at this
because I'm very organized.

63
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:13,052
I love sports,
well not hockey, so much.

64
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:18,153
You see, once the kids were born
I decided to stay home for a while.

65
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:23,009
Coz you know, babies
take up a lot of time.

66
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,926
Maybe you don't know.

67
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:31,310
Anyway, eventually they went to school

68
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:34,264
and I started having a little time in my hands.

69
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:37,551
And compiled these
stat books,

70
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:40,581
and made up this graphing system.

71
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:42,182
Yeah, hmm.

72
00:06:58,475 --> 00:06:59,793
How?

73
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:03,628
It's time, and a great
satellite TV package.

74
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:09,973
Aram Finklestein, that's
a Jewish name, right?

75
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:19,098
What are your feelings
about women, Aram?

76
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:22,260
Are you kidding?
I think you're great up until...

77
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:27,872
Recently I was planning on spending the rest
of my life with a woman.

78
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,569
Not that I wanted to spend it
with a man, I just...

79
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:36,875
One experience with a woman,

80
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:45,198
kind of took away my faith in love,
and I guess, everything.

81
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:51,635
Aram, I know you took some Women's studies
courses in College.

82
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,200
But other than that, do you have any kind of experience

83
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:58,024
that you think might have prepared you for this job?

84
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:05,690
I used to buy
tampons for my mother.

85
00:08:06,242 --> 00:08:10,330
You will fit in perfectly, yes.

86
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:15,197
I have met my soul mate.

87
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:19,502
You met a really hot French girl
who needed a green card.

88
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,916
- She was so...
- Hot.

89
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,997
- She wasn't that.
- Sexy.

90
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:27,109
It was something else. She needed me.

91
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:28,981
Yes, to get a green card.

92
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:33,081
There's got to be more meaning
to it than all of this.

93
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:38,029
You know living at your parents' place isn't
exactly... grab a life by the balls you know.

94
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:39,760
I'm saving up.

95
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:44,813
I hate to tell you this but...
you work in a coffee shop.

96
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:48,169
And your hot French wife
left you for her brother.

97
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,680
Stop it.

98
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:51,922
Can I get you something?

99
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,590
Yeah, this ad says...
you have an apartment for rent?

100
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:57,023
Yet, ours have a...

101
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,821
Which I would be happy to show you.

102
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:03,822
- Sure.
- Cool.

103
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:06,423
{Whispering}.

104
00:09:06,557 --> 00:09:09,402
I'm Mitchell, and this right here is Aram.

105
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:11,817
He's trying to figure out the meaning of life.

106
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:16,405
He also is a wonderful babysitter
if you ever need one.

107
00:09:17,267 --> 00:09:19,127
Just a break of the apartment.

108
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:22,060
- Hey, little guys.
- Mama, I do not want to live here.

109
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,422
- I want my room.
- How many more apartment are we going to look at?

110
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,009
- I got an apartment.
- You're fast.

111
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:38,615
It's not great, but my husband
won't be there so that's a plus.

112
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,886
How are you so well adjusted?

113
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:44,240
All those years with the PTA, I don't have a choose.

114
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,013
How's the job search?

115
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:48,780
I got one, fact check for SNN.

116
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:52,603
You are unbelievable, you're almost fully healed.

117
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:56,883
You know everyone says what a nightmare it is to get divorced
you're bad, I feel good.

118
00:09:57,548 --> 00:09:59,249
No residual or anything?

119
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:02,571
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

120
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:05,094
Trapped in some suburban hell, same thing

121
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:08,087
day after day like a
"hamster in a wheel.

122
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:09,820
Up on your feet, let's ride to happiness.

123
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:13,329
All you need now to
complete the healing is to get laid.

124
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,991
Oh no, that's one thing
I'm not ready for.

125
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:18,111
Look I don't expect you
to fall in love with this guy.

126
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:23,347
This guy?
Oh, no! What have you done?

127
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:26,419
A chiropractor, who fixed me up with
that whole elevator shaft thing.

128
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:30,107
Anyway, he smells great, and went
to an Ivy League College.

129
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:32,121
- Where?
- Santa Barbara.

130
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:33,785
That's not Ivy League.

131
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,087
Well, he's in great shape,
and he has a country house.

132
00:10:36,122 --> 00:10:37,643
And I already told him all about you.

133
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,846
Wait, I think that's the kid
who showed me the apartment.

134
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:42,782
The one that tried to kiss you?

135
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:45,621
No, he just works
in the coffee shop right below.

136
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:48,472
- Too bad, he's cute.
- Yeah like 10.

137
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:50,458
Nice ass, Coffee boy.

138
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,372
Just go out with my
chiropractor, and have a good time

139
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,683
maybe screw him, you know, that's seems right.

140
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:09,129
Why are you here?
It's been three weeks.

141
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:10,872
I came to see you.

142
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:39,501
Have fun.

143
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:43,173
There's this huge kid,
and he has like so much fat on him.

144
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:47,771
He sat at me at gym class,
and told me who would change my name to Pablo.

145
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:52,053
- Frankie, that is terrible, are you okay sweetie?.
- it's Pablo.

146
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:53,483
and yes, it was fun.

147
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:56,132
- So, listen...
- Oh, uh.

148
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,993
- What?
- Whenever you say, "So, listen,"

149
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:00,631
is always something strange.

150
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,909
It's not weird, it's just that I'm
thinking about going on a date.

151
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:06,621
I don't know, what I really want to but I,

152
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:09,695
I think it will be a positive step for me..

153
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:12,584
But I just wanted to see how
you guys would feel about it..

154
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:14,284
Are you going to have sex with them?

155
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,007
That's an inappropriate question..

156
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:26,868
Hey guys, you know, if we're going to live in the city,

157
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:29,449
we're going to have to learn to deal
with these kind of stuff ok.

158
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:33,527
So just stick with me and be polite.

159
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,690
- Hello
- Hi

160
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,954
Thanks you for coming in on such short notice.

161
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:48,697
I won't normally put you on this type of situation,

162
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:51,623
without some training,
but we're really in a vine.

163
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:54,760
- Whatever I can do to help.
- Ok, great, now why don't you put your suit on.

164
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,380
And then meet me at the activities room.

165
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:59,090
- A suit?
- Yeah, it's in the closet behind you.

166
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:03,049
Now try to hurry, self-defence class
starts exactly at 5:30.

167
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:05,378
Mommy, why do you have to do this?

168
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:09,529
Because now that we live in New York
we're going to all kinds of different people.

169
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:11,453
and we need to know
how to deal with them.

170
00:13:11,488 --> 00:13:13,244
Like the man with the penis?

171
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:19,962
So you're walking down the street,
and all of a sudden you hear...

172
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:24,263
hey, sweet lips, I like that ass.

173
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:28,409
Hey mommy, why don't you come over here,
sit on my face...?

174
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,802
Hey, kid, how would like
to make a quick $ 100?

175
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:36,412
- Yes, sure.
- No, you don't kid, you don't want that money.

176
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:40,375
Self-preservation in
in a city of predators.

177
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:43,675
That's what you will learn in here.

178
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:47,020
Let's meet our perpetrator.

179
00:13:50,758 --> 00:13:52,441
Hi

180
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,865
No words perf
unless they're scripted.

181
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,171
Begin scenario eight.

182
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:14,491
Hey, sweet lips.

183
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,308
Scenario 3.

184
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:24,954
Hey, baby, that should be illegal.

185
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:33,461
5.

186
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:37,634
Mrs. Sanchez, it appears you have
a yeast infection,

187
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:43,716
and an unbelievable set of tits.

188
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,960
For our last exercise,
I am going to demonstrate

189
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:56,567
what I call, "Ocean of anger. "

190
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:59,948
Hold on, because we are about to go deep.

191
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,929
All of us as
women have developed

192
00:15:02,964 --> 00:15:05,855
a reservoir of resentment and anger.

193
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:10,308
And these reservoirs put together
form an ocean,

194
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:15,822
and this ocean is available
for all us to draw from.

195
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:20,345
It holds the collective power
of every women,

196
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:25,333
who has ever been wronged
in an inappropriate sexual remark

197
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:29,898
being underpaid for a
job you've done better than a man,

198
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:33,915
ancestor who was a slave.

199
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:39,481
Or rice picker, or simply

200
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:41,456
Lowman on the totem pole.

201
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:47,843
A husband who has wronged you,
who has cheated and lied to you,

202
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,438
or you, or you, or you.

203
00:15:51,473 --> 00:15:55,215
- I'm a lesbian.
- See me after class.

204
00:15:55,285 --> 00:16:00,798
All of this anger is present
in all of you, right now and always.

205
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:03,357
I need a volunteer.

206
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:09,164
Mom!

207
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,360
Don't!

208
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:21,314
You are going to call upon this history

209
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:26,157
and unleash the ocean of anger on our perf.

210
00:16:26,223 --> 00:16:29,052
May I, just need a quick bathroom break?

211
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:31,392
Zip it, perf.
Tell him to zip it.

212
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:36,801
- Zip it, perf.
- Again, good, louder.

213
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,001
Zip it, perf.

214
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:53,774
Now tell him what
you want to tell him.

215
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:06,630
Dirty little fucking scumbag.

216
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:10,714
take your disease riddled whore
and fuck her in hell

217
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:12,379
for all eternity,

218
00:17:12,414 --> 00:17:15,120
May the devil burn you,

219
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:18,172
with hot jagged metal,

220
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:23,059
and suffocate you with mountain fury.

221
00:17:23,194 --> 00:17:25,454
Now, unleash!.

222
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,055
Oh my God.

223
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:33,337
Is there a safe word I should be aware of?

224
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,247
Time out.

225
00:17:56,908 --> 00:18:00,475
My life was never going to be this way

226
00:18:14,812 --> 00:18:16,735
It's okay.

227
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:26,426
I know you.

228
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,190
I don't see how getting beat up
by a bunch of chicks everyday

229
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:31,952
is getting you any closer
to the meaning of his life.

230
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:35,309
I'm helping people,
I'm contributing to the world.

231
00:18:36,471 --> 00:18:38,495
Not like an actor.

232
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,815
Buddy, I reflect life back unto itself, ok?

233
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,798
Thereby, taking mirror,
like a theatre mirror.

234
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:56,430
- Look at you.
- Oh, it's not as bad as it feels.

235
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:58,751
My mom was sorry she beat you up so bad.

236
00:18:58,786 --> 00:19:00,497
Thank you, Frankie.

237
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:03,535
Don't worry about it,
your mom didn't beat me up.

238
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:04,836
I've been going through a lot...

239
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,175
- Can I get a blueberry muffin...?
- Not right now sweetheart.

240
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:10,709
I've been going through a lot recently
I didn't realize how much it was affecting me.

241
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:12,799
- Don't worry about it.
- Just saying sorry.

242
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:15,042
- I pick it up.
- I helped.

243
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:18,040
If palm gets squeezed into it, you could die.

244
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,089
I was wondering
if I could take you up on your offer

245
00:19:22,124 --> 00:19:23,668
to baby-sit.

246
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:26,121
If it still holds, that is.

247
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,602
I don't really... I mean, I haven't
you know in a little while...

248
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:31,896
I figured since they,
hired at the Women's Centre,

249
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,229
You must be trustworthy.

250
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,745
I guess I could pop upstairs
some day after work for a couple of hours.

251
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,645
Would Thursday work?

252
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,290
- She has a date.
- With a big pimp.

253
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:49,959
Where do you learn this stuff?

254
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:54,498
Olivia at school taught me, she's
my hell, we play.

255
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,454
Whatever happened to kickball.

256
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,250
Would 7 o'clock be okay?

257
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:04,403
Oh, great.

258
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:12,953
There are times when the lost
must be found,

259
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:17,073
and other times when the lost
must find themselves.

260
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,695
Very well said Rabbi.

261
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,613
Not that he's a bad little boy
just misguided, falling in with the wrong crowd.

262
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:27,756
Are you talking about me? I only hang out
with you and Dad?

263
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:33,063
The battles are not only fought on
the battlefield, Roberto but also in the soul.

264
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,252
My soul is fine. Great.

265
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:37,412
What does his future hold?

266
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:39,418
Mom, he's not a palm reader.

267
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:41,599
A new job is in order.

268
00:20:43,634 --> 00:20:48,268
Luckily, my cousin is a head hunter
are you interested in business, Aram?

269
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:50,033
Yes

270
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:53,019
Kids, your babysitter's here.
Come say hello.

271
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:56,168
Sadie usually goes to bed a bit later than Frankie,

272
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:58,604
but due to her unscheduled
emergency surgery

273
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:00,291
she'll be going to bed the same time.
- Oh my God.

274
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:05,844
Are you sure I should be staying with
her after she just had surgery?

275
00:21:11,784 --> 00:21:14,256
This was her surgery.

276
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,941
I told you it was dead
when I found it.

277
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,573
Yes, but I highly doubt
its organs have been harvested.

278
00:21:19,608 --> 00:21:22,780
- I hate you.
- Can I play Wii?

279
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,164
For half an hour.

280
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:29,451
- You're going to be okay, right?
- Yeah

281
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:32,716
Truth is, I didn't know if I want to go on this date,

282
00:21:32,717 --> 00:21:34,834
it's just my friend, she's kind of

283
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:38,164
forcing me. Things we need to get with.

284
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:42,284
Release some tension.

285
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:47,702
Do I look okay? Everything's in order.

286
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:51,050
It seems to be.

287
00:21:54,975 --> 00:21:57,882
- Goodbye, Frankie.
- Bye.

288
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:06,656
- Hey Frank.
- Call me Pablo.

289
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:10,990
He also had some cranial seizures as well as TMJ.

290
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:14,768
So what did you do?

291
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:17,777
I went right home and I took out my skeleton.

292
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:23,326
- Your skeleton?
- It's really as weird as it sounds.

293
00:22:23,361 --> 00:22:28,183
I have this bone replica skeleton, keep it the house
and I use it to figure stuff out.

294
00:22:28,884 --> 00:22:32,222
This way I can put it in different positions and
see how they affect his bone structure.

295
00:22:32,563 --> 00:22:35,510
- It's a him?
- Yes it's him.

296
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:38,488
Thought it would be weird if it was a her.

297
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,302
That way people might think
I'm seeing somebody,

298
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:46,623
and it might actually drive away
beautiful women like you.

299
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:48,704
I'm a mom.

300
00:22:49,506 --> 00:22:51,534
Why did I say that?

301
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:54,087
It's okay, it's alright, I know. It's true.

302
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:59,042
You are a mom.
And you are incredibly beautiful.

303
00:22:59,053 --> 00:23:02,228
You have excellent posture.

304
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,396
Excuse me for just a second.

305
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,894
You haven't told me much about yourself.

306
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:40,030
My God.

307
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:47,609
- Hello
- I'm here.

308
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:49,768
I thought I'd lost you for a second.

309
00:23:56,226 --> 00:24:00,680
No, I grew up just outside
San Francisco.

310
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:03,659
That's a great town.

311
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,497
Do you have any hobby?

312
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:12,464
Just take care of my kids.

313
00:24:12,499 --> 00:24:15,540
No, no, that's not

314
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:19,024
a hobby.

315
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:24,416
I used to like to windsurf.

316
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:27,706
Long board? Short board?
Ocean, lake, what?

317
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,847
Lake, mostly lake.

318
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:34,309
I competed when I was younger.

319
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:46,032
Competed in windsurfing,
That's impressing.

320
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:47,921
So?

321
00:24:47,956 --> 00:24:50,503
You.. like the beautiful you, you

322
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:57,654
You are fascinating.

323
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:03,679
What's your normal job?

324
00:25:03,714 --> 00:25:06,084
- I work at the coffee shop.
- I mean your real job?

325
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:08,551
It was my real job.

326
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:10,326
but you are in the blow up suit too.

327
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:12,534
That was just once, I quit there.

328
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:15,423
- Didn't you go to college?
- Yes

329
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:18,165
I hope I'll have a real job
by the time I'm your age.

330
00:25:19,982 --> 00:25:21,321
Knockout!.

331
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,431
The Pablo man had knocked you out.

332
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:27,847
So are we going to have fun tonight
or you're going to be one of those boring babysitter?

333
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:30,014
Hey guys, it's me.

334
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:36,117
I don't know why you're not picking up,
Anyway, I hope everything's okay.

335
00:25:38,518 --> 00:25:40,274
Yeah, ok, bye.

336
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:43,137
Worried about the kids, huh

337
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:53,200
My new babysitter have not much experience yet.

338
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,003
I know exactly what you need.

339
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:02,590
See, we all hold our
tension somewhere.

340
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:05,132
For you, it's in your shoulders,

341
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:11,317
and just a little bit in your ass.

342
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:15,012
There's much experience as I have...

343
00:26:16,047 --> 00:26:19,989
can tell just by the way
as people walk...

344
00:26:24,902 --> 00:26:27,037
and even by the way they smile.

345
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,542
No charge.

346
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:46,302
This thing got my arm.

347
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,618
I'm running through the forest.

348
00:26:52,034 --> 00:26:55,853
Leave me one arm,
please don't...

349
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:01,166
I'll get claustrophobic wearing human skin mask.

350
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:03,403
You couldn't even wear
a hulk mask last Halloween.

351
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:05,924
That's because it was hot and it smelled bad.

352
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,435
- That was your breath, retard.
- Sadie...

353
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,258
- Actually...
- C'mon, you don't need to do...

354
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:10,959
It's 11 o'clock.

355
00:27:10,992 --> 00:27:13,950
Got to to get you to bed
before your mom comes home.

356
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:18,451
- How about the "Exorcist".
- Okay.

357
00:27:18,552 --> 00:27:19,916
I don't feel so good.

358
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:21,664
I might throw up.

359
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:25,073
This chocolate bar is bigger than you

360
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:27,674
If you're going to throw up, can't we do it
before your mom gets home, please.

361
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:30,631
I always throw up when mentioning
throw up, and before a girl.

362
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,880
I love throw ups.

363
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:34,778
- Eew, you love to eat throw up?
- Sadie.

364
00:27:34,813 --> 00:27:36,124
What?

365
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,439
You're going to freak him out
you're getting us all in trouble.

366
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:41,571
You know actually I feels sick.., Frankie?

367
00:27:41,606 --> 00:27:43,856
- That was nice, listen
- What?.

368
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:48,004
Eating a raw skinned pigeon
with mustard and rotten milk,

369
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:51,413
just chewing on those intestines
and those little bones..

370
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:53,436
Okay, off to bed, c'mon... - Yummy

371
00:28:01,168 --> 00:28:03,201
Touch my cock.

372
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:07,363
Stop the car.

373
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:15,256
- You have a problem.
- I have a problem?

374
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,516
Thanks for offering.

375
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,099
I'd love to tell you.

376
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:45,503
In a taxi. It seems like the perfect place.

377
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,212
Hobby

378
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:02,545
Home making.

379
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:11,404
How could this happen to me?
Do you ever wonder that?

380
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,297
How could I have floated so far

381
00:29:16,362 --> 00:29:20,904
off the path I thought I was on?

382
00:29:21,005 --> 00:29:23,830
I just thought maybe

383
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:29,361
it would be some meaning to my life.

384
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:36,676
I'm not making any sense.

385
00:29:46,757 --> 00:29:48,757
Maybe you'll come back again

386
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:54,220
Cause I think the kids could really
use some continuity.

387
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,942
Shit.

388
00:30:01,287 --> 00:30:06,437
I have no fucking money.
Can you believe that ?

389
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,141
Can I pay you tomorrow?

390
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,795
It's no problem.

391
00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:24,141
Hey it's you, eating a croissant.

392
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:27,142
French chick must be fading, huh.

393
00:30:27,442 --> 00:30:30,149
- Don't change the music.
- What, they're shooting music.. oops?

394
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:35,886
- What do you think about kids?
- I think about making them all the time.

395
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:40,116
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- What are you talking about?

396
00:30:40,701 --> 00:30:45,971
- I don't know, being entirely responsible
for another human being's life.

397
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,862
It's crazy.

398
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:51,282
- Aram, Aram
- Mama's dead!

399
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,049
What? - C'mon.

400
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:58,727
She's not dead.

401
00:30:58,762 --> 00:31:00,929
It could be post-mortem twitch.

402
00:31:01,564 --> 00:31:03,699
Kids fall back.

403
00:31:10,757 --> 00:31:13,157
Hey.

404
00:31:15,368 --> 00:31:16,868
Sandy.

405
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:24,440
It's morning.

406
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:37,921
Oh my God, I slept with a babysitter.

407
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,642
You didn't sleep with a babysitter.

408
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:44,383
We thought you were dead.

409
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:48,838
Yeah, we thought you might have
asphyxiated on your own vomit

410
00:31:51,593 --> 00:31:54,864
Aram can take us to school.
Coz we're already late.

411
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:59,710
- Could you? -Sure

412
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:03,103
Can you pick them up too?

413
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:08,011
Are those stat sheets ready yet?

414
00:32:08,046 --> 00:32:08,842
Yeah, printer 4.

415
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:17,053
Sandy, you got a minute?

416
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:25,712
Am I fired?

417
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:27,845
What! Why would you say that?

418
00:32:28,735 --> 00:32:30,719
Because...

419
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,403
I'm so hangover, I guess.

420
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,396
I have two kids and no husband

421
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:41,236
I haven't had a real job since
graduate school. I'm so sorry

422
00:32:42,349 --> 00:32:44,366
Oh, please don't apologize.

423
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:47,454
I was really calling you in to see
if you wanted to write for me.

424
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:54,104
I find the guys stuff gets boring and repetitive.

425
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:58,649
And I saw that stat book you put together, amazing.

426
00:32:58,684 --> 00:33:01,073
Clearly obsessive, reminds me of me

427
00:33:03,747 --> 00:33:05,503
Do you do yoga?

428
00:33:06,715 --> 00:33:08,973
I'll do yoga if I could win.

429
00:33:09,008 --> 00:33:11,231
I'm going to take you some time.

430
00:33:20,393 --> 00:33:23,148
- Thanks.
- Hydrate.

431
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,345
Cool, what's your catch phrase going to be?

432
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,265
I don't think it's going to be like that, Frankie.

433
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:33,566
I'm just going to be writing the basis of
the story and she'll fill in the flavour.

434
00:33:33,815 --> 00:33:37,259
- What about suck it?
- Why are you such an idiot.

435
00:33:37,294 --> 00:33:38,637
It's just an idea.

436
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,281
That's really exciting though, I mean,
and you can even get some airtime.

437
00:33:42,516 --> 00:33:45,319
I don't think so. -That'll be cool, mom.

438
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:47,746
You have the face for it.

439
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:50,162
That's a nice thing to say.

440
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:53,533
"You have the face for it. ",
Hmm, love you, love you, love you

441
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:58,199
I'm just saying that your mom has a face

442
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:01,951
to put on TV.

443
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:08,490
I'm very together, I never
missed taking my kids to school.

444
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:14,019
You don't have to explain anything, I promise
I know what it's like to go through a divorce.

445
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:16,077
Are your parents divorced?

446
00:34:16,112 --> 00:34:18,087
No, I am sort of.

447
00:34:19,095 --> 00:34:21,223
You're so young.

448
00:34:21,258 --> 00:34:22,984
When do you have the time?

449
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,136
It was short-lived, her name was Alice,

450
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:29,286
she left me for her brother.
He wasn't really her brother

451
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:32,813
he was just posing as her brother
so he could be close to her

452
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:34,758
So she could use me to get a green card.

453
00:34:34,793 --> 00:34:38,135
What!? That is horrible.

454
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,212
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

455
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:47,140
The worst part about it though
is I can't bring myself to finalize the divorce

456
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,873
because if I do
then she'll get kick out of the country

457
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:53,013
That would be so cruel, you know.

458
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:58,386
God, I wished I could get my husband
kicked out of the country.

459
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:01,438
It's that bad, huh. -Yeah

460
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,008
- So sorry.
- Oh, no, me too, for you.

461
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:13,181
You know, Aram this has been really hard for me

462
00:35:13,216 --> 00:35:16,299
and with a new job, there's going to
be some longer hours.

463
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:19,520
And I was thinking, maybe you'd be willing

464
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:23,337
to help us out on more of a full time basis.

465
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:26,521
A nanny?

466
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:30,093
You're not from Trinidad, you're
from the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

467
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,784
Did we send you to college for this, Harry?

468
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:34,490
You always said
you just wanted me to be happy.

469
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:37,743
Within reason, this is not how you
contribute to the world.

470
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:40,177
Mom you work for Ralph Lauren.

471
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:41,223
People need clothes.

472
00:35:41,258 --> 00:35:44,038
This family needs me, she just got divorced

473
00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:46,836
and she got this great job

474
00:35:46,871 --> 00:35:49,891
and she needs someone to
trust to take care of these kids..

475
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:53,824
Mom it's not like it's forever.

476
00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:55,430
You know, I'm going to be making money.

477
00:35:56,524 --> 00:35:57,767
- Harry!
- Alright,

478
00:35:57,802 --> 00:36:00,779
you're still going out on interviews for other jobs.

479
00:36:00,814 --> 00:36:04,696
And in the meantime you can't
keep this for quite a while.

480
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:44,460
Let me try it, get a job, I'm a freaking racer.

481
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:49,932
It's not the same...It's not the same thing.
Coz you have to say the freaking first to make it work.

482
00:37:50,608 --> 00:37:52,306
It's much funnier with the freaking, right?

483
00:37:52,991 --> 00:37:54,868
I'm just going to go outside and grab a smoke.

484
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:02,616
Smoke? What are they from stone age?

485
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:06,740
Please for some goddamn God,
you got to find something wrong with every guy

486
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,594
Did you see how long it takes
the guy to order a bow wine?

487
00:38:09,629 --> 00:38:13,307
His father owns a vineyard
in Napa, so he knows a lot about it.

488
00:38:13,342 --> 00:38:14,519
Like he mentioned several hundred times.

489
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:16,993
He mentioned it once.

490
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,015
Who is calling you?
You don't have a life.

491
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:22,799
It's Aram, he taught me how to text.

492
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:25,641
Oh my God!
What?

493
00:38:25,676 --> 00:38:27,418
- You have a thing for the nanny
- Oh, please.

494
00:38:30,535 --> 00:38:32,346
He's just telling me that my kids are asleep.

495
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,047
Kids asleep. Frank to

496
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:37,331
Frank took two foot long poop, we measured.

497
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:39,038
It's disgusting.

498
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:43,105
Just keeping me in the loop and I appreciate that.

499
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:47,617
It's very funny, sincere.

500
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,895
and besides he's a lot more adult than
those guys you've set me up with.

501
00:38:52,145 --> 00:38:54,297
In a 24-year old kind of way.

502
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:57,414
- Let me see what you wrote.
- No, no... you're not

503
00:39:00,152 --> 00:39:04,734
About to bail on my date, set up monopoly?

504
00:39:04,769 --> 00:39:08,765
This is pathetic. Seriously?

505
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,902
Yeah

506
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,599
Ok, here's the pussy.

507
00:39:19,129 --> 00:39:24,684
I would love you to meet
Sunshine and Cinnamon.

508
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:27,462
Hi, I am Aram.

509
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:29,929
They love talking and stuff so...

510
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:34,132
Try to be normal, alright. Stay positive.

511
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,063
- Sorry. - Aram, hey.

512
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:40,725
It's a weird name.

513
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,952
Thank you.

514
00:39:42,987 --> 00:39:45,042
Mitch told me he is divorced.

515
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:47,397
It's weird, huh.

516
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:51,310
It's kind of normal to me,
you know, it's my life.

517
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:53,432
So I'm kind of used to it, I guess.

518
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:58,618
I guess if you mean, it's unusual, then yeah.

519
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:01,433
We'll talk a lot about this.

520
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:03,586
I guess.

521
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:08,959
I love theories.

522
00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:10,528
Make me a little horny.

523
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:17,553
I think I'm going to go.

524
00:40:27,951 --> 00:40:29,729
Hey, it's me, what are you guys doing?

525
00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:31,507
We're just playing "American Idol. "

526
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:36,063
That was truly dreadful Aram
Finklestein, awful.

527
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:40,025
You kind of like a little pitchy in the beginning
but dawg, I mean you put it together in the end,

528
00:40:40,275 --> 00:40:42,063
and man you rocked.

529
00:40:42,113 --> 00:40:45,833
Well Randy liked it, but I still don’t' think
I'm going to the next round.

530
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:47,080
I'm not going to be able to make it home for dinner tonight.

531
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:50,438
Yeah, no problem.
I could feed the kids.

532
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,803
You may have to put them to bed too.

533
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:54,140
Can be a late one, huh

534
00:40:54,275 --> 00:40:56,283
Yeah, a couple of
the Vikings player,

535
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:58,632
were charged of sexually assaulting a stripper

536
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:01,197
I have to come up with something
fizzy for the board to leave this.

537
00:41:01,632 --> 00:41:05,155
Well, Vikings have been attacking
people on ships for centuries now.

538
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,096
Aram, that's good but thank you.
I'll see when I get home okay.

539
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:26,461
I'm sorry.

540
00:41:27,577 --> 00:41:33,487
God, I can't imagine to be many more days like this.

541
00:41:33,722 --> 00:41:36,745
No prob, there's dinner for you on the table there.

542
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,876
Oh thanks, you didn't have to do that.

543
00:41:41,306 --> 00:41:44,310
Just whipped up on stuff that I learned on Top Chef

544
00:41:46,928 --> 00:41:50,514
The kids helped,
and Frank's pretty good.

545
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:54,259
Delicious, wow, hmm... wait

546
00:41:54,775 --> 00:42:01,219
I have these two tickets for the fight
on Saturday, I thought you might be able to use them.

547
00:42:03,466 --> 00:42:06,006
Aren't the kids with their dad this weekend?

548
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:09,353
- Yeah - And you don't want to use this?

549
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:13,722
My girlfriend's not free and I'm facing another date.

550
00:42:13,757 --> 00:42:15,964
So take whoever you want.

551
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,856
- That's really nice, thanks.
- You're welcome.

552
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:28,243
Hey, I was wondering if you are free this weekend.

553
00:42:28,278 --> 00:42:29,889
Coz I've got these tickets to the big fight.

554
00:43:09,827 --> 00:43:11,834
I hate it when the ref does that.

555
00:43:12,808 --> 00:43:16,218
Why bother having a rest,
just let them bare-knuckle it.

556
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:21,596
I can't believe you were thinking of that coming.

557
00:43:21,631 --> 00:43:22,483
Me neither.

558
00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:25,799
I can never be like this with Frank

559
00:43:27,556 --> 00:43:31,748
It was like I didn't even know if
I was happy when I was with him

560
00:43:32,673 --> 00:43:35,275
What makes
people do that? Just coast along.

561
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,605
And you know the thing that really sticks for me

562
00:43:38,855 --> 00:43:42,957
is that I never got the chance to
tell him how I felt.

563
00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:45,955
He has this strange ability,

564
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:50,323
to make me entirely lose my voice.

565
00:43:50,914 --> 00:43:53,224
Like some superpower, it's crazy.

566
00:43:55,627 --> 00:43:57,341
No Voice Man

567
00:43:57,376 --> 00:44:00,483
Steal You Voice Man, Quiet Man

568
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,557
Dr. Silence. - That's a good one.

569
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,457
Hey, Aram, right?

570
00:44:06,858 --> 00:44:08,921
Gile from Roscoe Mathis, I interviewed you.

571
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,284
Oh, yeah yeah. How are you?

572
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:16,928
Dude, you're the only person that's ever said no to us
most people would kill for that job.

573
00:44:17,578 --> 00:44:18,583
Sorry about that.

574
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:22,009
Ringside at the fight,
doesn't look like you're doing too bad.

575
00:44:22,044 --> 00:44:24,556
Let me know if you ever change your mind.

576
00:44:26,895 --> 00:44:28,513
- Thanks.
- Good to see you again.

577
00:44:31,993 --> 00:44:33,651
What?

578
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:36,399
It's just an entry level thing.

579
00:44:37,028 --> 00:44:42,476
At Roscoe Mathis? And you
let them go to be my nanny?

580
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:45,700
Idiotic.

581
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:47,890
I thought so too, for a minute.

582
00:44:47,925 --> 00:44:52,602
I wasn't really thinking clearly there after Alice.

583
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:59,465
And suddenly I just had a very clear thought in my head.

584
00:45:02,391 --> 00:45:05,423
What really matters are
the people in my life.

585
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:11,365
You and your family were, are some of those
people that make me feel good,

586
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,107
make my life good, every day.

587
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:24,196
That is the most wonderfully

588
00:45:24,231 --> 00:45:27,031
and jaded naive thing I've ever heard..

589
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:32,928
It's rare to find
a guy who's such a romantic.

590
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,618
Bright light.

591
00:46:09,472 --> 00:46:10,858
Close those eyes.

592
00:46:12,058 --> 00:46:14,241
I'm not tired.
- You're really going to sleep this off with me.

593
00:46:17,668 --> 00:46:19,174
I'm going to put this here okay.

594
00:46:22,507 --> 00:46:23,980
I really love your kids.

595
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,403
I know.

596
00:46:29,341 --> 00:46:30,831
I had fun tonight.

597
00:46:33,495 --> 00:46:35,243
Yeah... me too.

598
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:41,752
None of you to call me that word, okay.

599
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:44,852
It's not a weird word, though
It's just means a "female dog"..

600
00:46:46,085 --> 00:46:48,448
I'm not going to have semantics today, okay.
- What are you doing here?

601
00:46:48,483 --> 00:46:51,953
You know what it means, it's not okay to call
me that or anyone else for that matter

602
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:54,294
You've been in the city for a few months
they're already totally corrupted.

603
00:46:54,644 --> 00:46:58,062
- Dad's play sucks.
- Frankie, what happened?

604
00:46:58,078 --> 00:47:00,749
- Aram!?
- Guys, careful...

605
00:47:01,097 --> 00:47:03,710
C'mon you late night criminals

606
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,931
Hey, guess what? -You want to give me a million dollars?

607
00:47:09,966 --> 00:47:11,447
We saw a dead junk on the road.

608
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:12,786
Oh, even better.

609
00:47:12,821 --> 00:47:15,416
We wanted to touch it but dad wouldn't let us.

610
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,701
You're running a home for delinquent boys.

611
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:21,344
Aram helps me with the kids, Frank.

612
00:47:21,984 --> 00:47:24,007
The kids weren't here, so what's he doing here?

613
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:26,304
Can I just explain something to you?

614
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:29,342
You have no
rights in this house, okay.

615
00:47:29,804 --> 00:47:31,382
I don't like the way this separation is going.

616
00:47:32,823 --> 00:47:34,152
Oh Really?

617
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:39,110
Well, I'm loving the way it's going,
this is exactly how I envisioned my life.

618
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,131
- Noticed how weird this thing was.
- That's mine.

619
00:47:43,365 --> 00:47:45,739
What I want to say, it's going to come out wrong.

620
00:47:45,805 --> 00:47:48,190
I want you back. I want our life back.

621
00:47:48,504 --> 00:47:50,130
Why are you doing this?

622
00:47:50,494 --> 00:47:53,923
The truth is I couldn't handle the kids,
I just wanted to see you.

623
00:47:54,995 --> 00:47:57,888
You must missed me, at least a little.

624
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:01,893
I don't want you here.

625
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,069
Of course, I don't want to be here.

626
00:48:05,972 --> 00:48:08,956
If you're good, I'll come back and do the grunge.

627
00:48:17,991 --> 00:48:19,876
You can even work if you wanted to.

628
00:48:20,806 --> 00:48:22,379
Part time.

629
00:48:23,406 --> 00:48:25,161
Imagine this..

630
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:33,385
There are so many things
I wanted to say to you.

631
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:40,605
We're not going to need you anymore.

632
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,521
Unless you want to grab a bite to eat and
you can sit, are you on hourly?

633
00:48:43,556 --> 00:48:47,043
I think Sandy had something that
she wanted to say to you.

634
00:48:49,414 --> 00:48:50,859
Didn't you?

635
00:49:00,372 --> 00:49:05,715
I just wanted to tell you about some
feelings I've been having

636
00:49:09,151 --> 00:49:10,537
you know

637
00:49:12,509 --> 00:49:15,180
regarding you and your treatment with me.

638
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,259
What she wanted to say was...

639
00:49:21,446 --> 00:49:26,504
and, this is pretty much,
word for word, if I remember properly

640
00:49:27,015 --> 00:49:31,189
that you're a dirty little fucking scumbag

641
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:36,585
and I might be paraphrasing here, but you should

642
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:42,056
take your diseased riddled whore and
fuck her in hell for all eternity.

643
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:43,576
While the devil burns you...

644
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:47,715
with hot jagged metal and suffocates you

645
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:50,288
with molten fury.

646
00:49:55,364 --> 00:49:56,807
Fucking nutheads.

647
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,197
Don't come beg me to come back.

648
00:50:00,818 --> 00:50:02,410
This was the last straw.

649
00:50:07,842 --> 00:50:09,523
That was really good.

650
00:50:14,972 --> 00:50:18,652
And by the way, I never loved you.

651
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:21,873
And I'm changing our son's name to Pablo

652
00:50:22,378 --> 00:50:24,650
so I'm never have to be remembered of you.

653
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,691
And stuck at your little bitch.

654
00:50:32,826 --> 00:50:34,979
You are off tomorrow, come take me out.

655
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:39,495
Dude, back in the saddle!

656
00:50:39,518 --> 00:50:41,824
Who's the unsuspecting lovely lady?

657
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:44,865
- Her name? -Yes

658
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,903
The thing that you will be calling out in bed.

659
00:50:49,371 --> 00:50:50,886
if she's all upon you...

660
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:56,654
Sandy

661
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,923
It's your boss' name, isn't it?

662
00:51:00,822 --> 00:51:03,789
Wait a minute, are you
going to date your boss?

663
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,833
Oh that's hot.

664
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:09,837
Oh, wait no, she's like 60 though, I thought.

665
00:51:10,065 --> 00:51:11,375
She's 40.

666
00:51:12,044 --> 00:51:13,640
But she got like a hundred kids though.

667
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,049
Two

668
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:19,815
So, when's this all going down?

669
00:51:20,682 --> 00:51:22,773
Actually, tonight.

670
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:26,076
Dude...

671
00:51:27,189 --> 00:51:29,222
tonight's my showcase.

672
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:31,668
I sent you a postcard.

673
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:37,641
Right. It's just that she already hired another babysitter.

674
00:51:38,981 --> 00:51:46,362
Work's been really busy so finding another
time would be virtually impossible.

675
00:51:46,484 --> 00:51:48,082
You'll understand.

676
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:55,342
Welcome one and all to the second annual
Hooligan theatre, group showcase workshop

677
00:51:55,377 --> 00:52:00,543
I am your host, actor, director,
choreographer, Magnus Croom

678
00:52:01,176 --> 00:52:02,680
Thank you.

679
00:52:06,614 --> 00:52:08,785
You are about to see 46

680
00:52:09,614 --> 00:52:15,770
of the most daring
the most empathetic beings in this out fair city.

681
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:22,308
offering to you, performances from their
favourite works of stage and screens.

682
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:24,324
Please keep your seats throughout.

683
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:29,401
for there will be no intermission.
Thank you and let the magic begin.

684
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:32,413
Stella!

685
00:52:39,115 --> 00:52:43,638
Stella!

686
00:52:44,136 --> 00:52:45,535
To be..

687
00:52:47,616 --> 00:52:48,982
or not be.

688
00:52:50,259 --> 00:52:51,749
That is the question

689
00:52:52,523 --> 00:52:54,382
Whether it is nobler

690
00:52:54,532 --> 00:53:00,339
in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune

691
00:53:12,771 --> 00:53:14,471
There he is.

692
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,577
I had him in view.

693
00:53:22,612 --> 00:53:24,853
I was feeling over the edge into a dive.

694
00:53:26,182 --> 00:53:30,092
He saw me when I moved in for the kill.

695
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:34,638
Is that how you remember it, Maverick?

696
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:38,757
- Is this Top Gun?
- Not pretty sure.

697
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:42,023
The rules of engagement
are not flexible, Maverick.

698
00:53:43,951 --> 00:53:49,531
They are there for your safety
you will obey them, is that clear?

699
00:53:49,581 --> 00:53:51,381
Maverick!

700
00:53:51,671 --> 00:53:53,258
Yes, sir, very clear.

701
00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:54,770
I guess we...

702
00:53:55,373 --> 00:53:56,749
I...

703
00:53:57,229 --> 00:53:59,051
was just a little over enthusiastic.

704
00:53:59,086 --> 00:54:01,525
I guess you were...

705
00:54:05,794 --> 00:54:07,094
Platoon!

706
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:11,403
Platoon!

707
00:54:17,681 --> 00:54:22,430
Hey, oh bro, I'm so glad you made it.

708
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:27,420
I made it... I'm here.

709
00:54:29,014 --> 00:54:31,149
.. saw the whole thing.

710
00:54:31,927 --> 00:54:33,592
Even your part.

711
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:38,568
Was that Top Gun? -You know it was.

712
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:46,222
We thought you were really great.

713
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:49,219
I loved your postmodern take on the whole thing

714
00:54:49,254 --> 00:54:54,601
and it was creative how you acknowledged how definitive it was.

715
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,097
Thank you.

716
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:02,499
Thank you so much.

717
00:55:04,413 --> 00:55:06,496
I told you guys...

718
00:55:07,043 --> 00:55:09,304
I told you people would get it.

719
00:55:10,304 --> 00:55:12,586
You got to go party with us.

720
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,162
I guess in a tree house.

721
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:37,128
Outdoor shower.

722
00:55:39,535 --> 00:55:42,568
Refrigerator -In a refrigerator?

723
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:44,333
All over it.

724
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,697
In the display case of the coffee shop where I work.

725
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,941
Don't do that..

726
00:56:02,842 --> 00:56:04,605
The craziest place

727
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:07,163
I have to say...

728
00:56:07,546 --> 00:56:10,410
on the surfboard, in the ocean.

729
00:56:15,527 --> 00:56:17,197
Sesha buche.

730
00:56:24,085 --> 00:56:25,759
It's really romantic.

731
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:09,586
Hello, Aram.

732
00:57:10,502 --> 00:57:13,560
I've been thinking a lot about you lately.

733
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:16,734
Hi, Alice.

734
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:22,655
I have regrets about, you know, how I broke up with you

735
00:57:23,996 --> 00:57:26,922
I found I have this problem with sex

736
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:33,875
because I just use it to get what I want and
I really think that's what I did with you.

737
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,166
I would love to meet with you,

738
00:57:40,201 --> 00:57:46,103
so we can talk and make some apologies to you.

739
00:57:46,946 --> 00:57:50,197
- Amends?
- Yes, amends.

740
00:57:52,213 --> 00:57:53,530
I'm really sorry.

741
00:57:54,673 --> 00:57:59,705
You know, I should get going.
I don't want to keep my sister waiting.

742
00:57:59,955 --> 00:58:01,311
What?

743
00:58:12,116 --> 00:58:13,719
I'm so hot.

744
00:58:40,454 --> 00:58:42,874
So? It was...

745
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,373
Long.

746
00:58:44,457 --> 00:58:47,717
I know, I think that you went to a hotel or something.

747
00:58:47,752 --> 00:58:48,922
Oh please.

748
00:58:52,049 --> 00:58:55,060
Honey, what's with your hair?

749
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:56,543
What?

750
00:58:59,946 --> 00:59:01,380
Okay, fine.

751
00:59:03,058 --> 00:59:05,970
It was awkward and cute and tedious.

752
00:59:06,864 --> 00:59:08,798
Did you just say cute and tedious?

753
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:12,029
I mean he's a kid and it was tedious.

754
00:59:12,459 --> 00:59:14,219
Sounds like you didn't give him a chance.

755
00:59:14,671 --> 00:59:19,057
- Did you even kiss those young, soft lips?
- We didn't get there.

756
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:23,871
We went to his friend's acting showcase
and to this after party at The Loft

757
00:59:23,965 --> 00:59:25,311
Acting showcase?

758
00:59:25,356 --> 00:59:27,499
But now I need a bath.

759
00:59:27,549 --> 00:59:29,613
Alright. My God

760
00:59:32,266 --> 00:59:33,613
What?

761
00:59:35,374 --> 00:59:37,508
Thanks for babysitting.

762
00:59:37,558 --> 00:59:39,048
Okay.

763
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:42,639
- Sorry you couldn't get laid.
- Shut up.

764
00:59:54,871 --> 00:59:56,984
Tedious. -Just to get rid of her.

765
01:00:00,223 --> 01:00:02,069
It was or it wasn't it?

766
01:00:03,655 --> 01:00:07,503
Oh wait a minute, not quite so much tongue.

767
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:19,521
Oh, God.

768
01:00:25,142 --> 01:00:26,476
That's gross.

769
01:00:26,669 --> 01:00:28,399
- Oh shit.
- Oh, God.

770
01:00:32,488 --> 01:00:35,956
Frank? What are you doing up?

771
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,935
Was Aram peeing on you?

772
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:39,410
No!

773
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,391
I would never do that.

774
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:45,659
Okay, are you sleeping over?

775
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:47,887
- No.
- No.

776
01:00:48,352 --> 01:00:49,694
- No?
- Oh, well.

777
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:53,456
Don't forget your pants.

778
01:00:56,773 --> 01:01:00,091
- So does that mean you and mom are going to have a baby?
- No!

779
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:03,109
I don't get it you said that sperm makes a baby.

780
01:01:03,144 --> 01:01:04,515
Sperm. and it does.

781
01:01:07,675 --> 01:01:10,609
Can we stop talking
about this, please?

782
01:01:12,314 --> 01:01:15,106
I like your mother and I
think she likes me,

783
01:01:15,536 --> 01:01:17,303
and it's all that's important.

784
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:19,321
You also work for her.

785
01:01:19,428 --> 01:01:22,068
- Who's turn is it?
- Mine.

786
01:01:24,308 --> 01:01:25,670
Okay.

787
01:01:26,255 --> 01:01:30,068
C’mon Frankie, let's get off the doughnuts.

788
01:01:33,704 --> 01:01:35,742
How is that possible?

789
01:01:36,149 --> 01:01:37,781
So you like mom.

790
01:01:38,596 --> 01:01:41,183
- Are you two going to date now?
- I don't know.

791
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:43,475
You don't really know anything, do you?

792
01:01:44,299 --> 01:01:47,762
- I mean she's kind of your girlfriend.
- Are you going to be our new dad?

793
01:01:48,012 --> 01:01:50,791
- and you'll also be our nanny?
- Yeah, and what do we call you?

794
01:01:50,869 --> 01:01:56,936
Jesus, I'm not being nominated to supreme court here guys,
I just had sex with your mother.

795
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:02,182
When I say sex,
I, I mean that I gave her

796
01:02:02,523 --> 01:02:03,981
a nice massage.

797
01:02:04,016 --> 01:02:05,440
With sperm.

798
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:10,982
Oh, you conniving little liar. Oh is he
hiding in the hall?

799
01:02:11,232 --> 01:02:13,798
My God, he was.

800
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,985
- It sounds so dirty.
- Dirty?

801
01:02:16,507 --> 01:02:18,413
Ok, it's a little dirty

802
01:02:20,548 --> 01:02:25,999
Well you got that out of your system. Now you're free to meet your next real guy.

803
01:02:26,337 --> 01:02:28,044
What does that mean?

804
01:02:28,094 --> 01:02:32,123
What, it means now when you meet a viable man
he won't have to be your rebound.

805
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,184
Coz your nanny was your rebound.

806
01:02:34,211 --> 01:02:36,829
Gives you pleasure to say that, doesn't it?

807
01:02:38,107 --> 01:02:40,345
I'm not sure of buying
that "The Rebound" thing.

808
01:02:40,595 --> 01:02:41,999
Oh what, you're going to date the nanny?

809
01:02:42,034 --> 01:02:45,461
Was having one night stand with a nanny more dignified?

810
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:47,936
No, just more practical

811
01:02:50,106 --> 01:02:51,506
Wait a minute.

812
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:53,767
You actually have feelings for this kid?

813
01:02:53,802 --> 01:02:55,679
Feelings? I have feelings
for everyone.

814
01:02:55,729 --> 01:02:57,051
That's the way the world works.

815
01:02:57,086 --> 01:03:00,093
God, you're in serious justification mode.

816
01:03:00,953 --> 01:03:03,081
Why do you have to be so cynical?

817
01:03:03,851 --> 01:03:08,608
I mean, I don't judge your
blatant disregard's recycling.

818
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:15,089
This is not about judgment. This is about my friend.

819
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,957
and what is realistic and what is not realistic for her.

820
01:03:18,223 --> 01:03:21,190
It's about me not wanting to see you get hurt.

821
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,783
Happy birthday... -Thank you.

822
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:26,576
1, 2, 3...

823
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,169
We get it.

824
01:03:34,989 --> 01:03:36,746
You need anything?

825
01:03:40,527 --> 01:03:41,833
Stop it.

826
01:03:41,923 --> 01:03:43,322
Okay.

827
01:03:46,931 --> 01:03:49,213
So did Aram tell you about this operation I'm having?

828
01:03:49,248 --> 01:03:51,480
- Harry?
- No.

829
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:54,538
They're going to give me a new asshole.

830
01:03:54,588 --> 01:03:55,815
There are children here.

831
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:57,967
- Cool, like from a dead guy?
- Sadie.

832
01:03:58,002 --> 01:04:01,600
I think they're going to have just passion,
one out of something.

833
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:04,673
Hopefully, it's something elastic.

834
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:06,824
Awesome.

835
01:04:07,306 --> 01:04:08,900
Excuse me.

836
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:20,416
This is so... weird.

837
01:04:20,758 --> 01:04:22,627
My dad telling you about his surgery?

838
01:04:22,766 --> 01:04:25,518
Yeah.. I didn't know they can even do that.

839
01:04:27,754 --> 01:04:29,760
You look really pretty..

840
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:34,050
No, no...

841
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:37,078
- We are in your parent's house
- I know.

842
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:42,121
Where is everybody?

843
01:04:44,951 --> 01:04:46,965
Just a little red, I don't think it's trapped.

844
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:52,767
Cake time.

845
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,971
This one is just from me.

846
01:04:59,947 --> 01:05:03,149
Gummy bears and hand lotion.

847
01:05:04,673 --> 01:05:06,422
Thanks, Dad.

848
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:14,405
Please. Open your mother's.

849
01:05:14,655 --> 01:05:17,084
- No, no, he'll open yours.
- You're his mother.

850
01:05:17,142 --> 01:05:19,645
Well, you're his employer. I insist.

851
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:21,792
You'll love it.

852
01:05:24,411 --> 01:05:25,884
It's not fake poop, is it?

853
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:28,264
- No.
- That's for Christmas.

854
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,898
Oh, you have Christmas.

855
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:33,145
What do we got here.

856
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:42,941
A human totem pole.

857
01:05:45,645 --> 01:05:47,498
Got to get you up here next time

858
01:05:47,533 --> 01:05:48,723
I don't think so.

859
01:05:49,193 --> 01:05:51,188
This is great, thank you so much.

860
01:05:51,438 --> 01:05:53,469
- Good.
- This is perfect.

861
01:05:58,967 --> 01:05:59,830
Thanks Mom.

862
01:05:59,865 --> 01:06:02,304
- That was just from me.
- So nice.

863
01:06:03,633 --> 01:06:04,895
Where did you get these butterflies?

864
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:09,803
My grandmother gave that to my father and
I think it's time for you to have that.

865
01:06:21,865 --> 01:06:24,689
The message applies all these years later.

866
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:29,203
Mother's love can never be replaced.

867
01:06:30,384 --> 01:06:32,076
- Never.
- Never.

868
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,590
Thanks, Mom.

869
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,463
It's antique.

870
01:06:39,498 --> 01:06:42,118
- Whoa, that's cool
- Beautiful.

871
01:06:42,363 --> 01:06:46,246
- I might throw up.
- What's the chances?

872
01:06:47,098 --> 01:06:50,093
60-40

873
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:53,948
Which direction?

874
01:06:55,759 --> 01:06:57,379
70-30. now.

875
01:07:01,461 --> 01:07:04,978
At least you're, we're in your percentages.

876
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,412
Sing me a song.

877
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,913
No, you go to bed.

878
01:07:11,948 --> 01:07:14,776
Sing me a song, or I'll blow up on you.

879
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:17,313
When you put it that way.

880
01:07:17,876 --> 01:07:22,351
Let's see what I have in my repertoire.

881
01:08:21,533 --> 01:08:23,554
Blow up.

882
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:30,840
Stay tonight.

883
01:08:43,335 --> 01:08:43,400
Two Months Later

884
01:08:43,435 --> 01:08:47,679
Are we sure this guy is real?
I mean, has anybody met him?

885
01:08:47,929 --> 01:08:49,923
He has no time to meet us,
he has high school and all that homework...

886
01:08:51,505 --> 01:08:53,192
Isn't he in a baseball team?

887
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:54,998
He's just running a little late.

888
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:58,749
Well, he's definitely responsible for
an attitude change, because you

889
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,036
well, you can't just stop smiling.

890
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:04,548
- She's glowing.
- Well, he's doing something right.

891
01:09:06,093 --> 01:09:08,142
I am sorry I'm late.

892
01:09:09,055 --> 01:09:12,428
Babysitter needs to be walked through everything.

893
01:09:14,578 --> 01:09:15,035
Hi.

894
01:09:15,070 --> 01:09:16,432
I'm Aram.

895
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:18,309
Sorry, this is Aram.

896
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,382
Would you like a coke or something?

897
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:23,844
- Scott.
- I'll take some wine..

898
01:09:28,704 --> 01:09:31,270
So Aram, I've heard a lot about you.

899
01:09:31,653 --> 01:09:33,149
I hope all good things.

900
01:09:33,184 --> 01:09:37,190
That you're wonderful with children,
that you're a great cook...

901
01:09:37,638 --> 01:09:40,438
that you were born in 1983.

902
01:09:40,918 --> 01:09:43,696
Jesus! I was pregnant
in 1983.

903
01:09:43,731 --> 01:09:48,721
Let's just go on and get it out on the table, get it out
in the open so we can enjoy our dinner.

904
01:09:48,971 --> 01:09:51,037
Yes, I was born in the early 80s.

905
01:09:51,072 --> 01:09:54,631
She also told me that you were very handsome
and that seems to be true.

906
01:09:54,928 --> 01:09:56,953
I think that it's great you guys are together.

907
01:09:57,274 --> 01:09:58,707
In the words of The Bart:

908
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:01,456
"The heart wants what it wants. "

909
01:10:01,658 --> 01:10:03,202
You are so gay.

910
01:10:05,054 --> 01:10:06,937
Sir, are you ready?

911
01:10:06,972 --> 01:10:08,574
I can be.

912
01:10:09,336 --> 01:10:14,439
Scott, right? Do you mind if I borrow your glasses?

913
01:10:16,889 --> 01:10:20,911
You know, I’m just kidding, I'm just
25 years, I don't need reading glasses.

914
01:10:31,578 --> 01:10:34,018
Don't you want to

915
01:10:34,053 --> 01:10:36,583
travel around the world, you know

916
01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:40,323
get crazy, rock Cleveland

917
01:10:40,358 --> 01:10:44,254
do things that people
your age supposed to do?

918
01:10:45,297 --> 01:10:46,779
Rock Cleveland?

919
01:10:46,823 --> 01:10:48,614
Yeah, rock it.

920
01:10:54,532 --> 01:10:55,907
Live.

921
01:10:57,325 --> 01:11:00,926
To tell you the truth this is
the most alive I've ever felt.

922
01:11:00,961 --> 01:11:02,790
You're too so goddamn romantic.

923
01:11:06,812 --> 01:11:09,735
What about kids? Kids of your own..

924
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:10,732
It's not like you're 50.

925
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:12,830
But I'm an old 40.

926
01:11:13,129 --> 01:11:14,787
What the hell does that mean?

927
01:11:15,514 --> 01:11:17,180
I'm wrinkling.

928
01:11:17,215 --> 01:11:20,364
You have no wrinkles on your face, do you?

929
01:11:21,369 --> 01:11:24,662
You seem to have eyes, something
that I really love about you.

930
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,095
I love you.

931
01:11:29,721 --> 01:11:33,732
and when you compliment me I love it,
when you compliment me.

932
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:35,292
You know, I heard you the first time.

933
01:11:37,623 --> 01:11:39,313
I have no idea what you were preferring to.

934
01:11:39,348 --> 01:11:43,183
- No? You said I love you.
- I didn't say that.

935
01:11:43,795 --> 01:11:45,900
I'm pretty sure you did.

936
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:47,128
And I love you too.

937
01:11:47,944 --> 01:11:49,319
Really?

938
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:51,910
Sorry, but I do.

939
01:11:55,676 --> 01:11:58,204
Just... take it slowly.

940
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:09,406
Slowly.

941
01:12:18,854 --> 01:12:23,623
Teram Owens, the man who wore baggage than
a first class passenger on the Titanic

942
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:24,975
Reaching but funny.

943
01:12:25,024 --> 01:12:27,641
T.O. the pig fan of the National Football League

944
01:12:28,334 --> 01:12:32,686
wherever he goes he is surrounded by distinct controversy.

945
01:12:33,317 --> 01:12:34,772
I like it.

946
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:37,233
Sex really agrees with your creative side.

947
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,694
Are you alright, sweetie? You look pale.

948
01:12:41,169 --> 01:12:43,237
No, I'm just dizzy from following you around.

949
01:12:44,922 --> 01:12:46,713
Well, get that to me, please.

950
01:12:46,748 --> 01:12:47,974
Right away.

951
01:12:59,372 --> 01:13:00,731
Alright.

952
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:04,486
It helps me think.

953
01:13:20,825 --> 01:13:22,601
We should talk.

954
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:26,619
I knew this was coming.

955
01:13:29,811 --> 01:13:32,437
You think that books that I read are too juvenile.

956
01:13:32,472 --> 01:13:35,063
I know, it's just I've always liked this stuff..

957
01:13:35,102 --> 01:13:36,737
I'm pregnant.

958
01:13:41,461 --> 01:13:43,098
But...

959
01:13:43,123 --> 01:13:45,557
I pull out most of the time.

960
01:13:47,989 --> 01:13:51,087
I know you're not ready for this,
just wanted to let you know that

961
01:13:51,337 --> 01:13:53,458
I feel the same way from you...

962
01:13:55,734 --> 01:13:59,789
I just thought that you wanted to take things slowly.

963
01:14:01,635 --> 01:14:02,985
I did.

964
01:14:06,396 --> 01:14:07,727
This is...

965
01:14:09,288 --> 01:14:10,648
big.

966
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,901
Very... big.

967
01:14:14,936 --> 01:14:16,943
I should've been more careful.

968
01:14:17,637 --> 01:14:22,207
I know this sounds crazy

969
01:14:25,008 --> 01:14:27,506
but I think I wanted this to happen.

970
01:14:30,648 --> 01:14:32,033
What?

971
01:14:33,647 --> 01:14:35,689
You said it yourself you don't want to just coast

972
01:14:36,770 --> 01:14:40,047
not just coast along but this isn't coasting.

973
01:14:40,787 --> 01:14:43,125
This is a roller coasting.

974
01:14:44,252 --> 01:14:45,679
Oh, my God.

975
01:14:47,451 --> 01:14:50,527
Not Oh God... this is a good thing,

976
01:14:50,638 --> 01:14:54,436
not the roller coasting thing, that was cheesy but...

977
01:14:55,072 --> 01:14:57,847
having a baby with you that's not cheesy.

978
01:14:57,882 --> 01:15:00,623
I mean... that's not what I'm saying just...

979
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:03,913
excited, I want to be your father.

980
01:15:03,955 --> 01:15:04,863
What?

981
01:15:04,898 --> 01:15:10,416
No, I want to be a father with you as the mother,
that's the important part.

982
01:15:10,451 --> 01:15:11,866
You being a mother.

983
01:15:12,366 --> 01:15:14,364
You know, I thought, I hope that kid is like you

984
01:15:16,737 --> 01:15:19,171
I hope the kid's like you.

985
01:15:19,206 --> 01:15:21,604
A girl with brown eyes...

986
01:15:23,015 --> 01:15:25,397
or a boy with brown eyes...

987
01:15:25,432 --> 01:15:28,227
or just any colour eyes

988
01:15:28,231 --> 01:15:30,768
Well, it's not the baby's head, not your size.

989
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:42,141
What about Gium?

990
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,979
For a boy.

991
01:15:46,515 --> 01:15:47,960
Gium Finklestein?

992
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:52,498
Okay.

993
01:15:57,858 --> 01:15:59,309
What about Ira?

994
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,611
The doctor will see you now.

995
01:16:03,895 --> 01:16:05,316
Great.

996
01:16:10,998 --> 01:16:12,594
Okay so...

997
01:16:12,854 --> 01:16:14,263
So?

998
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:15,998
The blood work is normal.

999
01:16:16,724 --> 01:16:18,823
In other words, your are healthy.

1000
01:16:19,422 --> 01:16:23,031
And that is always a good sign for future pregnancy.

1001
01:16:24,523 --> 01:16:26,132
What do you mean future?

1002
01:16:26,922 --> 01:16:31,379
I mean, this here is what we call an ectopic pregnancy.

1003
01:16:33,662 --> 01:16:37,497
There are any number explanations for this,
it's not necessarily because of your age.

1004
01:16:37,947 --> 01:16:38,372
God.

1005
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:40,838
This is something that happens
periodically.

1006
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:45,199
An embryo was formed but it intruded inside the fallopian tube

1007
01:16:45,234 --> 01:16:46,606
instead of the uterus.

1008
01:17:04,157 --> 01:17:06,372
Sandy, Sandy, Sandy...

1009
01:17:08,198 --> 01:17:09,829
This was crazy.

1010
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:12,757
I mean, what were we thinking, anyway?

1011
01:17:15,342 --> 01:17:16,810
You are so young.

1012
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:18,490
God!

1013
01:17:18,715 --> 01:17:21,792
You live at your parent's house and
technically you work for me

1014
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:24,042
and I was thinking about having your baby?

1015
01:17:24,077 --> 01:17:25,495
What is going on?

1016
01:17:26,512 --> 01:17:28,085
So you have to know?

1017
01:17:28,193 --> 01:17:29,525
Can we just find out?

1018
01:17:29,657 --> 01:17:32,073
That is a deceivingly mature thing to say.

1019
01:17:33,157 --> 01:17:34,610
Why is it deceiving?

1020
01:17:34,645 --> 01:17:36,771
Because you're 25 years old...

1021
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:39,822
you get drunk off half a beer

1022
01:17:39,918 --> 01:17:42,558
and you read the Harry Potter series in your spare time.

1023
01:17:42,864 --> 01:17:44,518
A lot of adult read those books.

1024
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:49,389
And besides the way I remembered it,
you're the one that asked me out

1025
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,652
I appreciate that you feel this could work

1026
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:54,894
more than you'll ever know.

1027
01:17:58,025 --> 01:18:00,083
You were such a good person

1028
01:18:00,335 --> 01:18:02,292
real special person,

1029
01:18:02,421 --> 01:18:07,158
I mean not filing a divorce so your
horrible ex-wife can get a green card

1030
01:18:08,202 --> 01:18:09,481
What'd be the point?

1031
01:18:09,516 --> 01:18:13,055
See, that's what I mean, someone like you
shouldn't be with someone like me.

1032
01:18:13,846 --> 01:18:15,484
An old girlfriend with two kids.

1033
01:18:16,226 --> 01:18:17,897
You're an ageist...

1034
01:18:18,147 --> 01:18:20,790
Yeah, yeah... I'm an old ageist.

1035
01:18:21,209 --> 01:18:23,438
Oh please, don't patronize me.

1036
01:18:24,073 --> 01:18:27,796
I may live with my parents and get drunk off half a beer

1037
01:18:28,046 --> 01:18:32,704
and yeah, I admit to being slightly adrift as far in my life

1038
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:34,405
but I'm not a complete idiot...

1039
01:18:34,655 --> 01:18:36,712
I know how I feel about you.

1040
01:18:38,010 --> 01:18:40,359
It's you that doesn't know
how you feel about me.

1041
01:18:42,067 --> 01:18:44,169
I just wish you had the guts to say it.

1042
01:18:47,361 --> 01:18:49,537
You've meant so much to me and my family

1043
01:18:51,437 --> 01:18:53,504
but this doesn't make sense.

1044
01:18:54,189 --> 01:18:56,329
And what future can we possibly have?

1045
01:19:04,133 --> 01:19:05,898
You know what I'm going to miss the most?

1046
01:19:09,435 --> 01:19:11,098
It's you...

1047
01:19:12,474 --> 01:19:14,257
Your friendship.

1048
01:22:05,366 --> 01:22:06,510
Go!

1049
01:22:06,545 --> 01:22:10,402
Graduating Class of 2012.

1050
01:22:10,503 --> 01:22:16,003
- Sadie Pageant and Sadie also received
the award for best science project

1051
01:23:59,954 --> 01:24:04,006
We need to say a special thanks to you
for bringing us into you homes,

1052
01:24:04,041 --> 01:24:07,273
but most of all to those unsung fanatics.

1053
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:09,722
- Who make us look good.
- Yeah, we do look good.

1054
01:24:10,268 --> 01:24:12,384
- I'm Laura Riley.
- And I'm Scott Reynolds,

1055
01:24:12,419 --> 01:24:14,209
TMI coming at you next.

1056
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:20,749
Sandy, you got a minute?

1057
01:24:25,465 --> 01:24:27,778
Hello.. hello.

1058
01:24:28,736 --> 01:24:29,869
Hello people.

1059
01:24:29,904 --> 01:24:33,281
Our illustrious leader, Ken Gordon,
has an announcement to make.

1060
01:24:35,294 --> 01:24:39,692
Although change can be
painful, change can also be a good thing

1061
01:24:39,727 --> 01:24:44,874
a necessary step in the evolution of
a company, a family like ours...

1062
01:24:45,312 --> 01:24:48,529
From the beginning of time
all the way till today

1063
01:24:49,341 --> 01:24:52,255
there are certain things that
you'll always find.

1064
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:58,797
Now, if you look at the pictures, can anyone see
what they all have in common?

1065
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:02,869
- Liv
- There are people in all of them.

1066
01:25:02,904 --> 01:25:04,330
Exactly, great answer.

1067
01:25:04,534 --> 01:25:09,115
so almost everywhere you go in the world
you're going to find these little communities of people

1068
01:25:09,265 --> 01:25:11,431
just like you guys
you guys are a community...

1069
01:25:11,466 --> 01:25:12,968
your class, your family...

1070
01:25:13,003 --> 01:25:15,020
I just came back from Mozambique.

1071
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:18,316
Okay. - I've been to the Non Talking Film Festival.

1072
01:25:23,482 --> 01:25:25,212
Aram?

1073
01:25:29,603 --> 01:25:32,917
You're the only one who gets
gifts from the kids at the end of every tour.

1074
01:25:32,952 --> 01:25:36,211
That's probably because
they're so excited, the tour is over.

1075
01:25:36,661 --> 01:25:37,577
Good to see you.

1076
01:25:37,826 --> 01:25:41,424
I was going to go get a drink,
You want to join me?

1077
01:25:42,879 --> 01:25:44,997
You know what I actually...

1078
01:25:45,651 --> 01:25:47,238
Have plans already...

1079
01:25:47,288 --> 01:25:49,108
I do.

1080
01:25:51,672 --> 01:25:53,444
You're impossible.

1081
01:25:53,905 --> 01:25:55,606
I've heard that before.

1082
01:25:57,729 --> 01:25:59,693
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay, have a good night.

1083
01:26:00,923 --> 01:26:08,499
Here's to your mother... the newest and undoubtedly
most qualified anchor of the network, very deserving.

1084
01:26:08,749 --> 01:26:09,861
Thank you.

1085
01:26:09,896 --> 01:26:12,057
- Congratulations Mom.
- Thanks.

1086
01:26:12,407 --> 01:26:16,829
I know your own show is big step up
but I'll miss you.

1087
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:22,368
I will be one studio over,
and I'll come in gusting.

1088
01:26:22,418 --> 01:26:24,387
I'm going to hold you to that.

1089
01:26:26,564 --> 01:26:28,570
Got to use the ladies' room

1090
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:30,576
then we could stuff our faces.

1091
01:26:36,549 --> 01:26:38,361
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

1092
01:26:42,848 --> 01:26:44,218
Hi

1093
01:26:44,606 --> 01:26:45,920
Hi

1094
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:56,477
- How are you?
- How are you?

1095
01:26:57,511 --> 01:26:59,161
You first.

1096
01:26:59,412 --> 01:27:01,822
I'm good, yeah good

1097
01:27:03,262 --> 01:27:05,333
Kids are great...

1098
01:27:05,886 --> 01:27:07,620
I just got promoted

1099
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,334
I'm going to start anchoring.

1100
01:27:09,725 --> 01:27:13,528
I watched you on TV, it's fantastic.

1101
01:27:13,934 --> 01:27:16,102
But that's not a surprise.

1102
01:27:18,073 --> 01:27:20,187
You look really good.

1103
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,186
I'm 30.

1104
01:27:29,766 --> 01:27:32,799
I'm sorry about.. you know.. things

1105
01:27:33,887 --> 01:27:35,955
Don't even...

1106
01:27:36,094 --> 01:27:38,520
it was just timely.

1107
01:27:41,685 --> 01:27:42,961
Travelled around the world.

1108
01:27:42,996 --> 01:27:45,594
- Oh you did?
- Never rocked the Cleveland.

1109
01:27:45,744 --> 01:27:48,297
but some pretty amazing things happened.

1110
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:52,191
Dad, I told you I could do it myself.

1111
01:27:52,226 --> 01:27:56,257
I knew I could do it yourself.
I bumped into a friend of mine.

1112
01:27:56,458 --> 01:27:59,234
Sandy... I want
you to meet my son, Zeke.

1113
01:28:00,837 --> 01:28:04,489
I met him in Bangladesh
and we kind of fell in love with each other.

1114
01:28:06,276 --> 01:28:09,369
It took a couple of years,
but now I'm his dad.

1115
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:11,289
Hi

1116
01:28:11,324 --> 01:28:13,544
Hi, I'm Zeke Finklestein.

1117
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:15,261
You are huh?

1118
01:28:15,296 --> 01:28:16,653
I'm Sandy.

1119
01:28:16,688 --> 01:28:18,780
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

1120
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:26,609
God, I bet you're an amazing dad.

1121
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:29,369
And his mom?

1122
01:28:29,404 --> 01:28:33,643
Just me and Zeke, it's hard to find someone
that's good enough for us.

1123
01:28:36,847 --> 01:28:38,490
Right?

1124
01:28:40,043 --> 01:28:42,383
And what about you? Boyfriend?

1125
01:28:44,312 --> 01:28:48,436
Dating... wasn't
my thing... I discovered.

1126
01:28:48,634 --> 01:28:50,596
That's too bad.

1127
01:28:51,235 --> 01:28:53,843
Would you like to join us?

1128
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:56,474
The kids would be thrilled.

1129
01:28:56,524 --> 01:28:58,224
I'm with my parents...

1130
01:28:58,259 --> 01:29:02,009
Oh, you had me so worried, did you fall in?

1131
01:29:03,514 --> 01:29:05,587
Mom, you remember Sandy?

1132
01:29:05,675 --> 01:29:08,734
How could I forget?
You talk about her every day.

1133
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:14,488
I was just saying to Aram, you know, if he wants to join us

1134
01:29:14,523 --> 01:29:17,630
Oh are you kidding, we would love to,
we would love to!

1135
01:29:17,688 --> 01:29:20,171
Harry, get up, we're moving.

1136
01:29:20,206 --> 01:29:21,318
I didn't do anything.

1137
01:29:21,353 --> 01:29:24,398
I didn't say you did anything
I said we're moving tables..

1138
01:29:32,368 --> 01:29:35,566
- Look who I just bumped into.
- Oh my God!

1139
01:29:35,601 --> 01:29:38,469
Look at how huge are,
you, you look like you're 13..

1140
01:29:39,517 --> 01:29:41,617
- I am.
- What?

1141
01:29:41,923 --> 01:29:45,299
I want you guys to meet someone,
this is my son Zeke.

1142
01:29:46,038 --> 01:29:49,582
- You want to play game boy?
- Yeah, go ahead... take a seat.

1143
01:29:50,081 --> 01:29:52,703
Nice to see you. It's been years. -Yeah

1144
01:29:56,603 --> 01:29:59,224
We all get older and
you stay the same.

1145
01:29:59,259 --> 01:30:00,325
Hello. -Hi

1146
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,460
What a surprise.

1147
01:30:02,687 --> 01:30:03,678
You remember us, do you?

1148
01:30:04,513 --> 01:30:07,124
You came to our house, remember?
