-Spock?
-As suspected.

308
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,643
The probe's transmissions
are the songs sung by whales.

309
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:26,274
-Whales.
-Specifically, humpback whales.

310
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,694
That's crazy. Who would
send a probe hundreds of light-years

311
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,864
-to talk to whales?
-lt's possible.

312
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,033
Whales have been on Earth
far earlier than man.

313
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:39,162
1 0 million years earlier. Humpbacks
were heavily hunted by man.

314
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,123
They've been extinct
since the 21 st century.

315
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,542
lt is possible that an alien intelligence

316
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,462
sent the probe to determine
why they lost contact.

317
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,340
-My God.
-Spock.

318
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,886
Could the humpbacks' answer
to this call be simulated?

319
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,890
The sounds, but not the language.
We would be responding in gibberish.

320
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,934
Does the species exist
on any other planet?

321
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:05,021
Negative. Humpbacks were indigenous
to Earth, Earth of the past.

322
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,692
Well, we have no choice.

323
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:12,737
We must destroy the probe
before it destroys Earth.

324
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,156
To attempt to do so
would be futile, Admiral.

325
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,991
The probe
could render us neutral easily.

326
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:19,035
We can't just turn away.

327
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,163
-There must be an alternative.
-There is one possibility,

328
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,249
but, of course,
l cannot guarantee success.

329
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,502
We could attempt
to find some humpback whales.

330
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,755
You just said there aren't any,
except on Earth of the past.

331
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:37,136
-Yes, Doctor, that is exactly what l said.
-Well, in that case...

332
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:40,223

at banning whaling,

612
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,462
there are still countries and pirates
currently engaged

613
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,507
in the slaughter of these
inoffensive creatures.

614
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,300
Where the humpback whale
once numbered

615
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,260
in the hundreds of thousands,

616
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,013
today there are less
than 1 0,000 specimens alive.

617
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,517
And those that are taken in
are no longer fully grown.

618
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,311
ln addition,
many of the female whales are killed

619
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,897
while still bearing unborn calves.

620
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:43,109
To hunt a species to extinction
is not logical.

621
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,946
Who ever said
the human race was logical?

to the lnstitute's pride and joy.

This is the largest seawater tank
in the world,

625
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,639
and it contains the only two
humpback whales in captivity.

626
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:23,984
They are mature humpbacks
weighing 45,000 pounds each.

627
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,739
They wandered into San Francisco Bay
as calves and were brought here.

628
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,367
We call them George and Gracie.

lt's perfect, Spock.

631
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,331
A male and a female humpback
in a contained space.

632
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,668
We beam them up together,
consider ourselves lucky.

633
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:51,761
Beautiful, aren't they?
And extremely intelligent.

634
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,180
Now if you'll follow me, please.

635
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,270
Despite all that they are teaching us,

636
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,940
we have to return George
and Gracie to the open sea.

637
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,234
-Why is that?
-Well, for one thing,

638
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,694
we simply don't have enough money

639
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,197
to keep feeding them
2 tons of shrimp per day.

640
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,659
-How soon?
-Soon.

641
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:18,496
lt's too bad, too, because they're really
quite friendly, as you could see.

642
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,041
l've grown quite attached to them.

643
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:29,549
And now, here's a much better way
to see George and Gracie. Underwater.

What you're hearing
is recorded whale song.

646
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,649
lt is sung by the male.

647
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:49,152
He'll sing anywhere
from 6 to as long as 30 minutes,

648
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,029
and then start again.

649
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:55,200
ln the ocean, the other whales
will pick up his song, and pass it on.

650
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:56,993
The songs change every year,

651
00:49:57,078 --> 00:50:00,288
and we still don't know
what purpose they serve.

652
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:05,210
Are they some kind
of navigational signal?

653
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,131
Could they be part of the mating ritual?

654
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:16,763
Or is it pure communication
beyond our comprehension?

655
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:23,311
-Frankly, we just don't know yet.
-Maybe he's singing to that man.

Come on,

731
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,296

for hard luck cases,

732
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:01,422
that's why l work with whales.

733

And don't try anything, either.

-l was not.

really trying to do back there?

742

lt wasn't some kind of macho thing,
was it? Because if that's all,

-Go ahead.

745
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,939
What's going to happen
when you release the whales?

746
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:05,028
They're going to have
to take their chances.

747
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,613
What does that mean, exactly,
take their chances?

748
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,450
lt means that they will be at risk
from whale hunters,

749
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:14,037
the same as the rest of the humpbacks.

750
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,747
What did you mean
when you said all that stuff,

751
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,957
back at the lnstitute, about extinction?

752
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:21,586
-l meant...
-He meant what you said on the tour,

753
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,504
that if things
keep going the way they are,

754
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:27,216
-the humpbacks will disappear forever.
-That's not what he said, farm boy.

Professor Scott.

a way to manufacture a wall,

831

that would do the same job
but be only 1 " thick.

You've got to let me go in there.

Admiral, may l suggest
that Dr McCoy is correct?

1083
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,566
We must help Chekov.

ls that the logical thing to do, Spock?

1085

No, but it is the human thing to do.

-Right. Will you help us?
-How?

Well, we're going to have

-Kidney dialysis.

l opposed your enlistment in Starfleet.

1378
01:52:40,838 --> 01:52:43,673
lt is possible
that judgement was incorrect.

1379
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:48,261
Your associates
are people of good character.

1380
01:52:50,013 --> 01:52:51,806
They are my friends.

1381
01:52:53,434 --> 01:52:54,976
Yes, of course.

1382
01:52:57,354 --> 01:53:00,189
Do you have a message
for your mother?

1383
01:53:00,274 --> 01:53:01,357
Yes.

1384
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:05,153
Tell her l feel fine.

1385
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,825
Live long and prosper, Father.

1386
01:53:12,035 --> 01:53:14,579
Live long and prosper, my son.

1387
01:53:45,569 --> 01:53:49,906
McCOY: The bureaucratic mentality
is the only constant in the universe.

1388
01:53:50,741 --> 01:53:52,366
We'll get a freighter.

1389
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:55,578
With all respect, Doctor,
l'm counting on Excelsior.

1390
01:53:55,662 --> 01:54:00,249
Excelsior? Why in God's name
would you want that bucket of bolts?

1391
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:02,210
A ship is a ship.

1392
01:54:02,294 --> 01:54:05,880
Whatever you say, sir. Thy will be done.

1393
01:54:32,115 --> 01:54:35,660
My friends, we've come home.

1394
01:54:46,338 --> 01:54:49,215
-Helm ready, Captain.
-All right, Mr Sulu.
