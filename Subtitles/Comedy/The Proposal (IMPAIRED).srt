How's my favorite writer?

Of course you've been

because you
know I'm right.

Frank, people in this
country are busy, broke,

41
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,293
and they hate to read.
They need someone
they can trust to say,

"Hey! Don't watch
<i>CSI: Indianapolis</i> tonight.

if she doesn't get her
manuscript in on time

72

Cancel the call, push
the meeting to tomorrow

your coffee why?

Because your
coffee spilled.

So, you drink unsweetened
cinnamon light soy lattes?

I do. It's like
Christmas in a cup.

Is that a
coincidence?

- Incredibly, it is.
- [phone ringing]

just in case
yours spilled.

94
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:48,249
That would
be pathetic.

00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:19,496
Uh, I read a few pages.
I wasn't that impressed.

105
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:20,897
- Can I say something?
- No.

106
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:23,066
I've read thousands
of manuscripts,

107
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:24,301
and this is the only one
I've ever given you.

108
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:26,270
There's an incredible
novel in there.

109
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:28,205
The kind of novel
you used to publish.

110
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:31,525
Uh, wrong. And I do think you
order the same coffee as I do

111
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:33,860
just in case you spill,
which is, in fact, pathetic.

112
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:35,362
- Or impressive.
- I'd be impressed

113
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:36,630
if you didn't spill
in the first place.

114
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:37,964
Now remember, you're
just a prop in here.

115
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:40,301

Oh. Beautiful breakfront.
Is it new?

118
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:54,214
It is English Regency Egyptian
Revival, built in the 1800s

119
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:57,251
but, yes, it is new
to my office.

120
00:05:57,352 --> 00:05:58,869
Witty.

121
00:05:58,936 --> 00:06:01,672
Bob, I'm letting you go.

122
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:06,243
Pardon?

123
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:07,027
I asked you over
a dozen times

124
00:06:07,128 --> 00:06:08,329
to get Frank
to do <i>Oprah,</i>

125
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,279
and you didn't do it.

126
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,582
You're fired.

127
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:14,884
I have told you
that is impossible.

128
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:17,421
Frank hasn't done an
interview in 20 years.

129
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:19,155
[Tate] Well that is
interesting, because I just

130
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:21,859
got off the phone
with him, and he is in.

131
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,111
Excuse me?

132
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:25,930
You didn't even
call him, did you?

133
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:28,882
- But...
- I know, I know.

134
00:06:28,983 --> 00:06:32,085
Frank can be a little scary
to deal with. For you.

135
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:35,222
Now, I will give you two
months to find another job.

136
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:38,125
And then you can tell
everyone you resigned, OK?

137
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,980
What's his twenty?

138
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:47,951
He's moving.
He has crazy eyes.

139
00:06:48,052 --> 00:06:49,887
Don't do it, Bob.
Don't do it.

140
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:53,958
- You poisonous bitch!
- [all gasp]

141
00:06:54,059 --> 00:06:55,675
You can't fire me!

142
00:06:55,776 --> 00:06:57,878
You don't think I see
what you're doing here?

Sandbagging me
on this Oprah thing

144
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:01,548
just so that you can
look good to the board?

145
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:04,801
Because you are
threatened by me!

146
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:07,637
- And you are a monster.
- Bob, stop.

147
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:11,041
Just because you have
no semblance of a life

148

outside of
this office,

149
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:15,011
you think that you
can treat all of us

150
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:16,497
like your own
personal slaves.

151
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:19,299
You know what?
I feel sorry for you.

152
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,068
Because you know what you're
gonna have on your deathbed?

153
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:24,354
Nothing and no one.

[breathes deeply]

00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:30,560
Listen carefully, Bob.

I didn't fire you because
I feel threatened. No.

157
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:37,717
I fired you because you're
lazy, entitled, incompetent

158
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:39,336
and you spend more time
cheating on your wife

159
00:07:39,437 --> 00:07:40,704
than you do
in your office.

160
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:42,071
And if you say
another word,

161
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:44,408
Andrew here is gonna have you
thrown out on your ass, OK?

162
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,993
Another word and you're
going out of here

163
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:48,261
with an armed escort.

164
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:50,096
Andrew will film it with
his little camera phone

165
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:51,781
and he will put it
on that Internet site.

166
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:52,883
- What was it?
- YouTube?

167
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:55,568
Exactly. Is that
what you want?

168
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,371
Didn't think so.
I have work to do.

169
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:59,539
[all murmuring]

170
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:01,625
Have security take his
breakfront out of his office

171
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:02,826
and put it in my
conference room.

172
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:03,794
Will do.

173
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:04,928
And I need you
around this weekend

174
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:06,397
to help review his files
and his manuscript.

175
00:08:06,498 --> 00:08:09,032
- This weekend?
- You have a problem with that?

176
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,967
No. I... just my
grandmother's 90th birthday,

177
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:12,536
so I was gonna
go home and...

178
00:08:12,637 --> 00:08:14,305
...it's fine.
I'll cancel it.

179
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:16,340
You're actually saving me from
a weekend of misery anyway,

180
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:18,675
so it's...
good talk, yeah.

181
00:08:18,776 --> 00:08:23,797
I know, I know. OK, tell
Gammy I'm sorry. OK? What...

182
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:25,198
Mom. What do you
want me to tell you?

183
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:27,835
She's making me
work the weekend.

184
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:29,135
No, I'm not... no.

185
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:30,604
Listen, I've worked too
hard for this promotion

186
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:31,805
to throw it
all away, OK?

187
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:33,340
I'm sure that
Dad is pissed,

188
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:34,942
but we take all
of our submissions

189
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:36,276
around here
very seriously.

190
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:39,847
We'll get back to
you as soon as we can.

191
00:08:39,948 --> 00:08:41,798
- Was that your family?
- Yes.

192
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,650
- They tell you to quit?
- Every single day.

193
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:46,770
Miss Tate's office.

194
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:49,572
Oh... Yeah.
OK. All right.

195
00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:51,775
Bergen and Malloy want to
see you upstairs immediately.

196
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:54,361
[groans] OK. Come get me in ten
minutes. We've got a lot to do.

197
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:55,679
Okey-doke.

198
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:58,999
[phone ringing]

199
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:03,020
Good morning, Miss Tate.

200
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:06,773
Jack, Edwin.

201
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,842
Margaret, congratulations
on the <i>Oprah</i> thing.

202
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:10,711
- That's terrific news.
- Thank you, thank you.

203
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:13,647
This isn't about my second
raise, is it? [chuckles]
Just kidding.

204
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:17,351
Margaret, do you
remember when we agreed

205
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,269
that you wouldn't go to
the Frankfurt Book Fair

206
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,888
because you weren't allowed
out of the country

207
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:22,756
while your visa application
was being processed?

208
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,841
Yes. I do.

209
00:09:23,942 --> 00:09:26,193
And... you went
to Frankfurt.

210
00:09:26,294 --> 00:09:28,411
Yes, I did. We were going
to lose DeLillo to Viking.

211
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:30,514
So... really didn't
have a choice, did I?

212
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:31,865
It seems that the
United States Government

213
00:09:31,966 --> 00:09:33,884
doesn't care much who
publishes Don DeLillo.

214
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:36,670
We, uh, just spoke to
your immigration attorney.

215
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:39,340
Great. So, we're all
good? Everything good?

216
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,925
Margaret, your visa
application has been denied.

217
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:45,212
- [stammers]
- And you are being deported.

218
00:09:45,463 --> 00:09:46,279
Deported?

219
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,931
And apparently there
was also some paperwork

220
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:49,666
that you didn't
fill out in time.

221
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:53,803
Come on. Come on! It's not
like I'm even an immigrant!

222
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:55,973
I'm from Canada,
for Christ's sake.

223
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:58,224
There's gotta be... there's
gotta be something we can do.

224
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:00,227
We can reapply,
but unfortunately

225
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:01,745
you have to
leave the country

226
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:03,697
for at least
a year.

227
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,287
OK. OK, well, that's
not ideal, but, uh..,

228
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:12,255
I can, uh... I can manage
everything from Toronto...

229
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:14,774
- [Bergen] No, Margaret.
- ...with videoconferencing
and Internet.

230
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:15,959
[Malloy]
Unfortunately, Margaret,

231
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,977
if you're deported,

232
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:18,712
you can't work for
an American company.

233
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:21,230
Until this is resolved I'm
going to turn operations over

234
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:22,282
to Bob Spaulding.

235
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:25,068
Bob Spaulding?
The guy I just fired?

236
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:26,403
We need an
editor in chief.

237
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:27,437
He is the only person
in the building

238
00:10:27,538 --> 00:10:28,872
who has enough
experience.

239
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:30,557
- You cannot be serious.
I beg of you.
- Margaret.

240
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:33,009
We are desperate
to have you stay.

241
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,562
If there was any way,
any way at all

242
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:37,230
that we could make this
thing work, we'd be doing it.

243
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:39,466
- [knocking]
- There is no way...
I am begging you.

244
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,134
No, Margaret. Excuse me,
we're in a meeting.

245
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:42,903
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What? What!

246
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:45,289
Mary from Miss Winfrey's office
called. She's on the line.

247
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:46,423
- I know.
- [Andrew] She's on hold.

248
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:48,041
She needs to speak
with you right away.

249
00:10:48,143 --> 00:10:49,576
I told her you were
otherwise engaged.

250
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,196
She insisted,
so... sorry.

251
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:54,064
So...

252
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,976
Uh... [mouthing]

253
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:08,662
[whispering]
Come here.

254
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:14,668
Uh... Gentlemen, I understand.
I understand...

255
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:17,838
the predicament
that we are in.

256
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,739
And, um...

257
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:23,610
And there's,
uh... well...

258
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:26,480
I think there's something
that you should know.

259
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:31,067
Uh... we're, uh...
we're getting married.

260
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,969
We are getting married.

261
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,838
- Who is getting married?
- You and I.

262
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:37,407
You and I are
getting married! Yes.

263
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:39,109
- We are.
- Getting married.

264
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,111
- [mumbling] We are
getting married.
- Yes.

265
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:44,565
Isn't he
your secretary?

266
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:49,720
- Assistant.
- Executive, uh... assistant
secretary. Titles.

267
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,354
But, wouldn't
be the first time

268
00:11:51,456 --> 00:11:53,690
one of us fell
for our secretaries.

269
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,692
Would it, Edwin?

270
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:58,145
[Margaret] With Laquisha.
Remember?

271
00:11:58,245 --> 00:12:01,715
So, yeah...
The truth is,

272
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:05,886
you know, Andrew and I, we're...
we are just two people

273
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:08,054
who weren't meant to
fall in love but we did.

274
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:09,489
No.

275
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,344
All those late nights at the
office and weekend book fairs.

276
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:15,662
- Yeah...
- No.

277
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:18,282
- Something happened.
- Something.

278
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:21,535
Yeah. Tried to
fight it and...

279
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:23,186
Can't, can't fight a...

280
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:27,690
Can't fight a love
like ours, so, uh...

281
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:31,128
Uh... Are we good
with this? Are you happy?

282
00:12:31,229 --> 00:12:34,881
Because, well...
we are happy. So happy.

283
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:36,316
- [Bergen] Margaret.
- Yes?

284
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,218
It's terrific.

285
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:40,003
Just make it
legal. Mmm?

286
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:42,656
Oh! Legal. [chuckles]

287
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:45,942
Yeah, well, then...
then that means we...

288
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:48,161
...we need to get ourselves
to the immigration office.

289
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:51,198
So we can work this
whole mess out. Right?

290
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:52,799
[Margaret] Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

291
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,967
We will do that
right away.

292
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:56,035
Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you.

293
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:58,372
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

294
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:01,090
[popping]

295
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:03,109
[woman whispers] Margaret and
Andrew are getting married!

296
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,377
[woman #2] What is that about?

297
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:06,512
[man whispering] Dragon Lady!
Here they come...

298
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:07,948
[snickering] Yeah.

299
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:09,749
[woman #3] What is he thinking?

300
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,750
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

301
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,936
[indistinct chatter]

302
00:13:13,037 --> 00:13:15,506
Dude, for real.
Her? [laughing]

303
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,608
[woman #4] Married? Didn't
even know they were dating...

304
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:26,082
[Margaret clears throat]

305
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:38,895
[clearing throat]

306
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,982
What?

307
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,133
I don't understand
what's happening.

308
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:46,086
[Margaret] Relax.
This is for you, too.

309
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:47,371
Do explain.

310
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,639
They were going
to make Bob chief.

311
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,258
So naturally I would
have to marry you.

312
00:13:51,358 --> 00:13:52,893
[Margaret] And what's
the problem?

313
00:13:52,994 --> 00:13:55,411
Like you were saving yourself
for someone special?

314
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:58,649
I like to think so.
Besides, it's illegal.

315
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,735
They're looking for terrorists,
not for book publishers.

316
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:03,236
- Margaret.
- Yes?

317
00:14:03,337 --> 00:14:06,557
- I'm not gonna marry you.
- Sure you are.

318
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:07,641
Because if you
don't marry me,

319
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:09,258
your dreams of touching
the lives of millions

320
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,578
with the written word
are dead.

321
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:19,936
Bob is gonna fire you the
second I'm gone. Guaranteed.

322
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:21,955
That means you're out on the
street alone looking for a job.

323
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:24,441
That means all the time that we
spent together, all the lattes,

324
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:26,693
all the canceled dates,
all the midnight Tampax runs,

325
00:14:26,794 --> 00:14:30,013
were all for nothing and
all your dreams of being
an editor are gone.

326
00:14:30,114 --> 00:14:32,532
But don't worry, after the
required allotment of time,

327
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:33,933
we'll get a quickie divorce
and you'll be done with me.

328
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:35,669
But until then,
like it or not,

329
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,837
your wagon is hitched
to mine. OK?

330
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:40,290
- [phone ringing]
- Phone.

331
00:14:48,048 --> 00:14:50,350
[indistinct chatter]

332
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:55,989
- This way.
- Margaret.

333
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,125
- [hisses] Come.
- The line...

334
00:14:58,226 --> 00:14:58,908
Next, please.

335
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:00,593
Ooh, ooh. Just, uh...

336
00:15:00,694 --> 00:15:02,379
Sorry, I just need to
ask him something.

337
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,531
I need for you to file this
fiancée visa for me, please.

338
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,351
[scoffs]

339
00:15:09,704 --> 00:15:12,055
- Miss Tate?
- Yes.

340
00:15:12,156 --> 00:15:14,607
Please,
come with me.

341
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,393
[woman] Yes, ma'am, I understand
that. We're backed up...

342
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:20,296
I have a bad feeling
about this.

343
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:21,565
[knocking]

344
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:25,318
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

345
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:27,721
Hi.
I'm Mr. Gilbertson.

346
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:29,822
- Ah!
- And you must be Andrew,

347
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:31,207
- and you must be...
- Margaret.

348
00:15:31,308 --> 00:15:33,242
...Margaret.
Sorry about the wait.

349
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:34,945
It's a, uh,
crazy day today.

350
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,180
Oh, of course, of course.
We understand.

351
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:39,215
And I can't tell you how much
we appreciate you seeing us

352
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:42,969
- on such short notice.
- OK. [sighs]

353
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,722
<i># Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh</i>
<i>buh, buh, buh, buuuh #</i>

354
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:47,640
So, I have one
question for you.

355
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,961
Are you both committing fraud
to avoid her deportation

356
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:55,298
so she can keep her position as
editor in chief at Colden Books?

357
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,684
- That's ridiculous.
- Where did you hear that?

358
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:00,954
We had a phone tip this
afternoon from a man named...

359
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:02,905
Would it be
Bob Spaulding?

360
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,174
Bob Spaulding.

361
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:07,461
Bob. Poor Bob.
I am so sorry.

362
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:11,614
Bob is nothing but a
disgruntled former employee.

363
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:12,698
And I apologize.

364
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,569
But we know you're
incredibly busy

365
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,206
with a room full of gardeners
and delivery boys to tend to.

366
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:21,374
If you just give us
our next step,

367
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:23,476
we will be out of your
hair and on our way.

368
00:16:24,028 --> 00:16:25,879
Miss Tate, please.

369
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:31,151
Let me explain to you the
process that's about to unfold.

370
00:16:31,252 --> 00:16:34,454
Step one will be
a scheduled interview.

371
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:36,389
I'll put you each
in a room,

372
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,107
and I'll ask you
every little question

373
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,176
that a real couple
would know about each other.

374
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:44,330
Step two, I dig deeper.
I look at your phone records,

375
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:46,833
I talk to your neighbors,
I interview your coworkers.

376
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:49,185
If your answers don't
match up at every point,

377
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:51,988
you will be deported
indefinitely.

378
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:54,423
And you, young man, will have
committed a felony...

379
00:16:54,524 --> 00:16:55,624
[woman shouting in Spanish]

380
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,861
...punishable by
a fine of $250,000

381
00:16:57,962 --> 00:17:00,496
and a stay of five years

382
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:04,233
in federal prison.

383
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:08,972
[Gilbertson] So, Andrew.

384
00:17:09,023 --> 00:17:12,809
You wanna... you want
to talk to me?

385
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,381
No?

386
00:17:20,835 --> 00:17:22,435
Yes?

387
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:28,308
The truth is...

388
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:31,160
[Andrew clears throat]

389
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:35,899
Mr. Gilbertson,
the truth is...

390
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,951
Margaret and I...

391
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:42,371
...are just two people

392
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:45,742
who weren't supposed
to fall in love.

393
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,311
[Andrew] But did.

394
00:17:50,014 --> 00:17:52,132
We couldn't tell
anyone we work with

395
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:54,500
because of my big promotion
that I had coming up.

396
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,152
- [Gilbertson] Promotion?
- Yeah.

397
00:17:56,254 --> 00:18:00,140
- Your...?
- We... we both felt, uh...

398
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,092
...that it would be
deeply inappropriate

399
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:04,260
if I were to be
promoted to editor.

400
00:18:04,361 --> 00:18:07,297
- Editor. Mmm-hmm.
- ...while we were...

401
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:11,033
So...
[clears throat]

402
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:12,602
Have the two of you
told your parents

403
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:14,270
about your
secret love?

404
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:17,573
Oh, I... impossible.
My parents are dead.

405
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:19,843
- No brothers or sisters either.
- Gone.

406
00:18:19,944 --> 00:18:21,978
Are your parents dead?

407
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,080
- Oh, no, his
are very much alive.
- No... very much.

408
00:18:24,182 --> 00:18:27,684
Very much. They're, ah...
Well, we were gonna tell
them this weekend.

409
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:31,671
Gammy's 90th birthday, and the
whole family's coming together.

410
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:33,373
And we thought it'd
be a nice surprise.

411
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,375
[Gilbertson] And where is this
surprise gonna take place?

412
00:18:35,476 --> 00:18:37,527
At Andrew's
parents' house.

413
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:38,761
Where is that
located again?

414
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:41,347
Umm... [scoffs] Why am I
doing all the talking?

415
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:42,699
It's your
parents' house.

416
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,500
Why don't you tell him
where it is. Jump in.

417
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:48,320
- Sitka.
- Sitka.

418
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:50,523
- Alaska.
- Alaska?

419
00:18:50,624 --> 00:18:52,876
You're gonna go to
Alaska this weekend?

420
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:56,162
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

421
00:18:56,263 --> 00:18:59,266
We are going to Alaska.
Alaska, that's where...

422
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:02,552
That's where my little...
that's where my Andrew's from.

423
00:19:03,988 --> 00:19:05,021
[Gilbertson] OK.

424
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:08,658
Fine. I see how
this is gonna go.

425
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:11,694
I will see you both
at 11:00 Monday morning

426
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:13,563
for your
scheduled interview,

427
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:17,334
and your answers better
match up on every account.

428
00:19:18,302 --> 00:19:19,669
- Thank you.
- Hello?

429
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,737
I'm looking forward
to this one.

430
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:21,671
We're looking forward
to this one.

431
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:22,906
Thank you.

432
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,808
Gonna be fun. I'll be
checking up on you.

433
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,344
You got it.

434
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:36,253
OK... so, what's gonna happen
is we will go up there.

435
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:38,054
We will pretend like we're
boyfriend and girlfriend,

436
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:39,956
tell your parents
we're engaged.

437
00:19:40,057 --> 00:19:41,591
Uh, use the miles
for the tickets.

438
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:44,160
I guess I will pop for
you to fly first class.

439
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:45,328
But make sure
you use the miles.

440
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:46,529
If we don't get the miles,
we're not doing it.

441
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,664
Oh, and please confirm
the vegan meal, OK?

442
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:50,666
'Cause last time they
actually gave it to a vegan,

443
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:52,135
and they, uh...
forced me to eat

444
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:54,971
this clammy, warm, creamy
salad thing, which was...

445
00:19:55,072 --> 00:19:56,706
Hey, I'm... Why aren't
you taking notes?

446
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:59,375
I'm sorry, were you
not in that room?

447
00:19:59,476 --> 00:20:01,795
What? What?

448
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,480
Oh! The thing you said
about being promoted?

449
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:06,616
Genius! Genius. He
completely fell for it.

450
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:07,984
I was serious.

451
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,770
I'm looking at a $250,000 fine
and five years in jail.

452
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:11,904
That changes things.

453
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:15,508
Promote you to editor?
No, no way.

454
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:17,143
Then I quit, and you're
screwed. Bye-bye, Margaret.

455
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:18,711
- Andrew!
- It really has been

456
00:20:18,813 --> 00:20:23,316
- a little slice of heaven.
- Andrew, Andrew! Fine, fine.

457
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:25,351
I'll make you
editor. Fine.

458
00:20:25,452 --> 00:20:28,971
If you do the Alaska weekend
and the immigration interview,

459
00:20:29,072 --> 00:20:31,724
I will make you
editor. Happy?

460
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:34,394
- And not in two
years. Right away.
- Fine.

461
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:36,246
And you'll publish
my manuscript.

462
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:39,249
Ten thousand copy
first...

463
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:40,950
Twenty thousand copies,
first run.

464
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:42,802
And we'll tell my family
about our engagement

465
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:44,437
when I want
and how I want.

466
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:46,772
Now, ask me nicely.

467
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,157
"Ask you nicely" what?

468
00:20:48,258 --> 00:20:52,128
Ask me nicely to
marry you, Margaret.

469
00:20:53,847 --> 00:20:57,200
- What does that mean?
- You heard me. On your knee.

470
00:21:06,227 --> 00:21:07,193
Fine.

471
00:21:09,113 --> 00:21:11,247
[honking]

472
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:17,687
- Does this work for you?
- Oh, I like this. Yeah.

473
00:21:17,788 --> 00:21:20,039
- Will you marry me?
- No.

474
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,607
Say it like
you mean it.

475
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,676
[clears throat]

476
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:27,630
- Andrew?
- Yes, Margaret?

477
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:30,533
- Sweet Andrew?
- I'm listening.

478
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:33,986
Would you please, with
cherries on top, marry me?

479
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,741
OK. I don't appreciate
the sarcasm, but I'll do it.

480
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:41,945
- See you at the
airport tomorrow.
- Good.

481
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:58,161
So, these are the questions
that INS is gonna ask us.

482
00:21:58,261 --> 00:22:01,114
Now, the good news is is
I know everything about you,

483
00:22:01,215 --> 00:22:02,782
but the bad news is
that you have four days

484
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:04,216
to learn all
this about me.

485
00:22:04,318 --> 00:22:08,238
So, you should...
probably get studying.

486
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:13,409
You know all the answers
to these questions about me?

487
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,795
- Scary, isn't it?
- [Margaret] A little bit.

488
00:22:15,896 --> 00:22:17,897
- What am I allergic to?
- Pine nuts.

489
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:20,066
And the full spectrum
of human emotion.

490
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,868
Oh, that's... that
was funny. [chuckles]

491
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:23,952
- Mmm-hmm.
- Umm...

492
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:26,806
Here's a good one.
Do I have any scars?

493
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,741
I'm pretty sure
that you have a tattoo.

494
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:30,593
Oh, you're pretty sure?

495
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:32,861
I'm pretty sure. Two years ago,
your dermatologist called

496
00:22:32,962 --> 00:22:34,763
and asked about a
Q-switched laser.

497
00:22:34,864 --> 00:22:36,216
I of course Googled
a Q-switched laser

498
00:22:36,317 --> 00:22:38,851
and found that they
in fact do remove tattoos.

499
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:40,803
But you canceled
your appointment.

500
00:22:42,022 --> 00:22:43,639
So what is it?
Tribal ink?

501
00:22:43,457 --> 00:22:45,524
Japanese calligraphy?
Barbed wire?

502
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,311
You know, it's exciting for me
to experience you like this.

503
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:50,496
Thank you. You're gonna have to
tell me where it is, though.

504
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:52,132
- No, I'm not.
- They're gonna ask.

505
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:54,684
We're done with that question.
We're done with that question.

506
00:22:54,785 --> 00:22:56,735
On to another question.
Let me see, let me see.

507
00:22:56,837 --> 00:22:59,822
Oh, here's one. Whose place
do we stay at, yours or mine?

508
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:01,390
That's easy. Mine.

509
00:23:01,491 --> 00:23:03,042
And why wouldn't
we stay at mine?

510
00:23:03,143 --> 00:23:05,644
Because I live at
Central Park West.

511
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:08,848
And you probably live at some
squalid little studio apartment

512
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:11,617
with stacks of yellowed
Penguin Classics.

Juneau? I thought we
were going to Sitka.

00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:24,263
- We are.
- How are we getting to Sitka?

- Oh...

- It's so good to see you!
- You're suffocating him, Grace.

- Come here.
- Hey, Gammy.

527
00:24:19,787 --> 00:24:22,304
Ah, Gammy. How are
you doing? Where's Dad?

528
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:25,158
Oh, you know your father.
He's always working.

529
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:27,626
Never mind about him.
Where's your girl?

530
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:30,129
Uh, she's...
right there.

531

- [Gammy] Ah.
- [Andrew] There she is.

532
00:24:31,865 --> 00:24:34,733
I guess the word "girl"
is inappropriate.

533
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:36,335

- [Margaret] Hello.

- Margaret, this is my mom.
- Oh, hello.

Yeah, great.
This is my gammy, Annie.

- Pleasure.
- Well, hello there.

538
00:24:45,796 --> 00:24:50,733
Now, do you prefer being called
Margaret or Satan's Mistress?

539
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,635
We've heard it
both ways.

540
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,436
[Gammy] Actually we've
heard it lots of ways.

Thank you so much
for...

00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,944
allowing me to be a
part of this weekend.

Oh, you're welcome.
We're thrilled to have you.

don't do that.

You didn't tell me about all
the family businesses, honey.

He was probably just
being modest, dear.

Oh.

What are we doing? Shouldn't we
check into our hotel right now?

Oh, we canceled
your reservation.

stay at a hotel.

Andrew! Help her
with those.

I'd love to, but she
won't let me do anything.

564
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,650
She insists on
doing it all herself.

She's one of those...
she's a feminist.

that broad was wearing?

This is the
last of 'em.

- Oh!
- Ooh.

- [Andrew] Five second rule.
- Got it!

That will
dry right off.

Psst! Psst! I'm not
getting on that boat.

574
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:11,740
You don't have to.
See you in a few days.

575
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:14,210
Psst! You know
I can't swim.

576
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:16,813
Hence, the boat.

577
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,304

Here we go.

Take your time, though.

a lot of baggage.

582
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,014
Just gonna give you
a little hand here.

Off ass!

You're there.

00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:02,702
[Margaret] Why did you
tell me you were poor?

591
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:04,036
[Andrew] I never said
I was poor.

592
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:05,788
But you never told
me you were rich.

593
00:29:05,889 --> 00:29:08,123
I'm not rich.
My parents are rich.

OK, you know what? That's
something only rich people say.

Nothing. It's just a

Is that a crime?

- Come on. Come on.

- A party?
- Yeah, I guess so.

Come on. Let's go. My grandma's

00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:00,743
I can pretend to be the
doting fiancé. That's easy.

618
00:30:00,844 --> 00:30:02,244
But for you,
it's going to require

619
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:04,546
that you stop snacking on
children while they dream.

620
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:07,282
Very funny. When are you going
to tell them we're engaged?

621
00:30:07,383 --> 00:30:09,101
I'll pick the
right moment.

622
00:30:09,202 --> 00:30:12,638
Hey, Andrew. Hi!

623
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:15,674
Mrs. McKittrick. How are you?
Nice to see you.

624
00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:17,409
Nice to see you, Mr. McKittrick.
This is Margaret.

625
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,311
- Hi. Pleasure.
- Margaret!

626
00:30:19,412 --> 00:30:20,713
Hi, how are you?
Pleasure.

627
00:30:20,814 --> 00:30:24,182
So I always wanted to know,
what does a book editor do?

628
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:26,251
[man] That's a great
question, Louise.

629
00:30:26,352 --> 00:30:28,954
I'm curious to know
the answer myself.

630
00:30:29,856 --> 00:30:31,790
- Hello, Dad.
- Son.

631
00:30:32,492 --> 00:30:34,126
This must be Maggie.

632
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:35,477
Uh, Margaret.

633
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:39,114
- Joe. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

634
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:42,751
So why don't you tell us
exactly what a book editor does.

635
00:30:42,852 --> 00:30:46,055
Besides taking writers out
to lunch and getting bombed.

636
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:48,641
[Louise] Now that
sounds like fun.

637
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:50,408
No wonder you like
being an editor.

638
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,344
No, Louise.
Andrew's not an editor,

639
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:53,746
he's an editor's
assistant.

640
00:30:53,847 --> 00:30:56,298
Maggie here
is the editor.

641
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,983
Margaret.

642
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:01,353
- So you're actually...
- Andrew's boss. Yeah.

643
00:31:01,454 --> 00:31:03,088
Well.
How about that.

644
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:04,490
[Louise] Huh.

645
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:06,725
I think I'll
get a refill.

646
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:13,766
- Charming.
- <i># And I love you</i>
<i>under my skin #</i>

647
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:16,969
That's a hell of a
first impression, Dad.

648
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,038
What the hell, Andrew?

649
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:21,841
You show up here after all this
time with this woman you hated

650
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:23,208
- and now she's your girlfriend?
- We just got here.

651
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:24,476
Can we wait two seconds

652
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:26,012
before we throw the
kitchen sink at each other?

653
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:29,281
Just never figured you for a guy
who slept his way to the middle.

654
00:31:29,382 --> 00:31:30,816
Actually, I'll have you know
that that woman in there

655
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,718
is one of the most
respected editors in town.

656
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:33,819
She's your meal ticket,

657
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,187
and you brought her home
to meet your mother.

658
00:31:35,288 --> 00:31:39,525
She's not my meal ticket, Dad.
She's my fiancée.

659
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:42,361
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

660
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:44,480
I'm getting married.

661
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:49,635
- How are you?
- Good, good. Thank you.

662
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:51,003
Would you care for
some hors d'oeuvres?

663
00:31:51,104 --> 00:31:52,371
No, I'm fine.
Thank you very much.

664
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:53,572
It's a tradition.

665
00:31:53,673 --> 00:31:55,273
It's the texture.
I'm not a fish person.

666
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:57,776
- You'll like it.
- You're very sweet.

667
00:31:57,961 --> 00:32:00,362
I think if you'll
just taste it.

668
00:32:00,464 --> 00:32:02,130
[muffled]
Thank you so much.

669
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:06,902
[Andrew] Ladies
and gentlemen...

670
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:09,337
I have a very important
announcement to make.

671
00:32:09,438 --> 00:32:10,989
Margaret and I
are getting married.

672
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:12,290
It's the paprika.

673
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:13,776
So sorry.

674
00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:16,812
That's OK.
It's wash-and-wear.

675
00:32:18,465 --> 00:32:21,650
[Andrew] Yep.
Honey? Where you at?

676
00:32:22,586 --> 00:32:24,136
Here it is.

677
00:32:26,873 --> 00:32:28,557
Come on down here,
pumpkin.

678
00:32:28,658 --> 00:32:30,459
- [Andrew] All right.
- OK.

679
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,978
Oh, look at her.
Look at her.

680
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,246
[clapping]

681
00:32:34,347 --> 00:32:36,715
Right there, ladies and
gentlemen. There she is.

682
00:32:36,816 --> 00:32:39,184
[woman]
Congratulations, Andrew.

683
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:40,252
Thank you.

684
00:32:40,353 --> 00:32:42,154
[Andrew]
Thank you very much.

685
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:44,957
- [woman] Time to celebrate.
- [woman #2] Get the champagne.

686
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:49,294
So that was your idea
of the perfect time

687
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:50,595
- to tell them we're engaged?
- Mmm.

688
00:32:50,696 --> 00:32:52,297
'Cause it was brilliant.
Brilliant timing.

689
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:54,099
Andrew. Hi.

690
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,270
Gert? Oh, my God.
Hey, hi. Wow.

691
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:00,605
How you doing? I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

692
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:04,042
Your mom probably wanted it to
be a surprise. So... surprise.

693
00:33:04,144 --> 00:33:06,578
- Right.
- And...

694
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:09,314
...we're being
completely rude. Hi.

695
00:33:09,415 --> 00:33:12,785
- [Andrew] Oh, God.
This is my ex...
- Hi. I'm Gertrude.

696
00:33:12,886 --> 00:33:15,120
- Oh! Oh, wow. Wow!
- You can call me Gert.

697
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:17,322
Well, congratulations,
you guys.

698
00:33:17,423 --> 00:33:18,390
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

699
00:33:18,491 --> 00:33:21,393
So did I
miss the story?

700
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:22,494
- What story?
- What story?

701
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:24,163
About how you proposed.

702
00:33:24,264 --> 00:33:28,784
Oh! How a man proposes says
a lot about his character.

703
00:33:28,885 --> 00:33:30,785
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

704
00:33:30,887 --> 00:33:33,571
I actually would love
to hear the story, Andrew.

705
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:34,607
Would you tell us?

706
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:36,775
- [man] Yeah.
- [crowd murmurs] Yeah.

707
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:38,877
- [giggling]
- [Andrew] You know what?

708
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:42,914
Actually, Margaret loves
telling this story...

709
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:45,518
so I'm just gonna let her
go ahead and do that.

710
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:47,753
[Andrew] 'Cause I think we
should just sit in rapture.

711
00:33:47,854 --> 00:33:50,956
Huh! Wow, OK.

712
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:54,993
Wow, where to begin...
this story.

713
00:33:55,094 --> 00:33:58,030
Well... um, wow.

714
00:33:58,131 --> 00:34:00,049
Mmm... yeah.

715
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:04,937
OK, well, um,
Andrew and I...

716
00:34:04,987 --> 00:34:07,772
Andrew and I were
about to celebrate

717
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:10,375
- our first
anniversary together.
- [all] Aw...

718
00:34:10,477 --> 00:34:13,328
And I knew that he'd been
itching to ask me to marry him.

719
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,414
And he was scared.
Like a little tiny bird.

720
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:18,783
So I started leaving him
little hints here and there...

721
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:21,786
...because I knew he wouldn't
have the guts to ask, but...

722
00:34:21,888 --> 00:34:24,489
That's not exactly
how it happened.

723
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,125
- No? Hmm.
- No. No.

724
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:28,827
I mean, I picked up on
all her little hints.

725
00:34:28,928 --> 00:34:30,879
This woman's about
as subtle as a gun.

726
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,014
- [all laugh]
- [Andrew] Yeah.

727
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:34,450
What I was worried
about was

728
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:36,201
that she might find
this little box...

729
00:34:36,302 --> 00:34:39,538
Oh! The decoupage box
that he made

730
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,507
where he'd taken
the time to cut out

731
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:44,476
tiny, little pictures
of himself. Yes.

732
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:48,147
Just pasted all over the
box. Oh! So beautiful.

733
00:34:48,248 --> 00:34:50,699
So I opened that beautiful,
little decoupage

734
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,536
and out fluttered these tiny,
little hand-cut heart confettis.

735
00:34:54,638 --> 00:34:58,523
And once they cleared,
I looked down, and I saw...

736
00:34:58,624 --> 00:35:01,459
...the most
beautiful, big...

737
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:03,028
...fat nothing.

738
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:04,246
No ring.

739
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:06,015
- No ring?
- What?

740
00:35:06,116 --> 00:35:09,084
No. But inside that box...

741
00:35:09,185 --> 00:35:10,769
...underneath
all that crap...

742
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:13,088
...there was a little
handwritten note...

743
00:35:13,189 --> 00:35:16,675
with the address to
a hotel, date, and time.

744
00:35:16,776 --> 00:35:18,343
Real Humphrey Bogart-type stuff.

745
00:35:18,444 --> 00:35:19,645
[man] Yeah.

746
00:35:19,746 --> 00:35:21,663
- Masculine.
- [grunts]

747
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:23,565
Anyway, naturally,
Margaret thought...

748
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:24,867
I thought he was
seeing someone else.

749
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:26,001
[crowd murmurs]

750
00:35:26,102 --> 00:35:27,185
It was a terrible
time for me,

751
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:29,722
but I went to
that hotel anyway.

752
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:31,657
I went there and I
pounded on the door,

753
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:33,592
but the door was
already unlocked.

754
00:35:33,693 --> 00:35:37,613
And as swung open that
door, there he was...

755
00:35:37,714 --> 00:35:39,014
- Standing.
- Kneeling.

756
00:35:39,115 --> 00:35:40,749
- Like a man.
- On a bed of rose petals,

757
00:35:40,884 --> 00:35:44,252
in a tuxedo.
Your son. Your son.

758
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:47,840
And he was choking back
soft, soft sobs.

759
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:51,359
And when he held back the tears
and finally caught his breath,

760
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,327
he said to me...

761
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:53,461
"Margaret,
will you marry me?"

762
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:56,999
And she said, "Yep."
The end. Who's hungry?

763
00:35:58,201 --> 00:35:59,084
[crowd cooing]

764
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:01,686
That is quite a story.

765
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:03,772
- [Gammy] Oh, Andy!
- Gorgeous.

766
00:36:03,874 --> 00:36:07,009
You are so sensitive.

767
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,845
Hand-cut confetti?
[laughs]

768
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:12,882
Hey! Let's see a kiss
from you two cuties.

769
00:36:12,983 --> 00:36:13,849
[man] Give her a kiss!

770
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,151
- No. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

771
00:36:16,253 --> 00:36:17,152
- Come on!
- [all cheering]

772
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:18,754
OK, all right.

773
00:36:18,855 --> 00:36:20,923
OK. Here we go.
Ready?

774
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,428
What is this? Kiss her on
the mouth like you mean it.

775
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:30,199
- Kiss her. Kiss her!
- [all chanting] Kiss her!

776
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,169
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her!

777
00:36:34,271 --> 00:36:36,071
OK!

778
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:38,040
- OK. All right.
- OK.

779
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:40,509
- Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm. OK.

780
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:43,745
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

781
00:36:43,846 --> 00:36:46,348
Andy! Give her
a real kiss!

782
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:49,051
- [chuckling] Gammy.
- A real one!

783
00:36:49,152 --> 00:36:50,752
- [woman] Yeah.
- [woman #2] You can do it!

784
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:52,354
Why don't we just do it?
Let's just do it really fast.

785
00:36:52,455 --> 00:36:53,355
Yeah. OK.

786
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:55,925
- [both] Mmmm.
- [cheering]

787
00:36:56,026 --> 00:36:58,944
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

788
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:01,430
- [muffled] OK.
- Mmm.

789
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:11,256
Hmm.

790
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:14,860
I'm so happy
for you two!

791
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:18,263
So happy!
So happy!

792
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:20,933
[woman] Let's get
the champagne!

793
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:23,452
So here we are.

794
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:27,022
This is your bedroom.

795
00:37:28,124 --> 00:37:34,062
Wow. Wow, this is, um...
beautiful. And the view.

796
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:35,731
And here's the bed.

797
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,634
Wow! Exquisite bed.
Exquisite.

798
00:37:38,735 --> 00:37:41,569
So... where is
Andrew's room?

799
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:43,538
Oh, sweetie, we're not
under any illusions

800
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,441
that you two don't
sleep in the same bed.

801
00:37:46,643 --> 00:37:48,861
[laughing] He'll sleep
in here with you.

802
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:51,279
Oh, great, 'cause
we love to snuggle.

803
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,048
- Don't we, honey.
- We're huge snugglers.

804
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:55,367
- [barking]
- Oh, my God. What is it?

805
00:37:55,468 --> 00:37:59,387
- Calm down, Kevin.
- Whoa! You are cute.

806
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:00,839
Who is this?

807
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,643
- That's Kevin.
I'm sorry, Margaret.
- So cute.

808
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:06,628
We just rescued him
from the pound,

809
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:08,797
and he's still in
training. Sorry.

810
00:38:08,898 --> 00:38:10,949
Just be sure you don't
let him outside,

811
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,567
or the eagles
will snatch him.

812
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,603
No, don't you
listen to her.

813
00:38:14,704 --> 00:38:16,438
She's just pulling
your leg, isn't she?

814
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:19,591
By the way, there are extra
towels and linens and things

815
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:20,809
in here
if you need them.

816
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,727
[Gammy] And if you
get chilly tonight...

817
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:24,463
...use this.

818
00:38:24,564 --> 00:38:26,231
It has
special powers.

819
00:38:26,332 --> 00:38:29,284
Oh, what kind of
special powers?

820
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:31,053
I call it
the Baby Maker.

821
00:38:31,154 --> 00:38:33,071
OK, well.
Then I guess we...

822
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:34,505
...gonna be super careful
with that one.

823
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:36,758
- Yeah, I'm just gonna...
- Don't throw it on the bed.

824
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:38,726
We'd better turn in.
It's been quite an evening.

825
00:38:38,827 --> 00:38:40,645
So good night,
everybody.

826
00:38:40,746 --> 00:38:41,713
- Good night.
- Good night.

827
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:45,433
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

828
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:48,603
- [chuckling] Good night.
- [Margaret] Good night.

829
00:38:50,823 --> 00:38:52,891
- [Gammy] Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

830
00:38:52,992 --> 00:38:54,359
Thank you so much.
Sweet dreams.

831
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,378
- Bye-bye, now.
- Bye.

832
00:38:59,331 --> 00:39:02,134
[Margaret] So, uh... you haven't
been home in a while.

833
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:05,503
I haven't had a lot of vacation
time the last three years.

834
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:07,939
[Margaret] Stop complaining.

835
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:13,512
Um...
Don't look, OK?

836
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,663
OK.

837
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:17,900
Are your eyes closed?

838
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:19,268
Completely.

839
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:22,871
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

840
00:39:31,314 --> 00:39:34,899
Those are the pajamas you
decided to bring to Alaska.

841
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,319
Yes, because I was supposed
to be in a hotel alone.

842
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:41,606
- Remember?
- Can we just go to sleep?

843
00:39:41,707 --> 00:39:43,975
- Fine.
- Great.

844
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:54,252
[exhales, clears throat]

845
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:15,541
Well. [clears throat]

846
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:16,842
Looks like I won't be
getting much sleep

847
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:19,627
with the sun
streaming in.

848
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:27,485
Thank you.

849
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:44,503
[phone ringing]

850
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:50,642
[Margaret] Andrew. Phone.

851
00:40:51,077 --> 00:40:53,878
Andrew!

852
00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:56,415
Crap. Andrew,
Andrew, phone.

853
00:40:56,516 --> 00:40:57,782
Andrew!

854
00:40:57,883 --> 00:40:59,951
Yeah... right.

855
00:41:03,389 --> 00:41:07,225
- Andrew, where is it?
- Purse, side pocket.

856
00:41:08,177 --> 00:41:10,712
- [thumping]
- [grunting]

857
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:15,584
Hello. Hello? Hello.

858
00:41:15,685 --> 00:41:17,486
Frank! Frank, darling.

859
00:41:17,587 --> 00:41:18,553
Darling, Frank.

860
00:41:18,654 --> 00:41:20,889
Are you there?
Hello? Hello? Oh, crap.

861
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,325
I have horrible service, Frank.
Give me just one minute.

862
00:41:24,426 --> 00:41:26,194
Oh, my God!
Margaret!

863
00:41:26,295 --> 00:41:28,797
[whispering] One... one minute.
Frank, hold on just a second.

864
00:41:28,898 --> 00:41:29,831
Frank, hold on.
No, no, no, no.

865
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:30,866
[door shuts]

866
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:33,768
Frank. Frank,
I'm sorry you feel

867
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:36,404
I pressured you into
doing Oprah, but...

868
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:39,774
Of course I want you
to be happy. Yes, yes.

869
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:45,830
Frank. Frank. Frank, darling.
Frank? It's going to be fine.

870
00:41:45,931 --> 00:41:48,199
I can just call them
and I can cancel.

871
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:51,169
[panting]

872
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,123
[Margaret] You are...
you are so right, Frank.

873
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:57,325
Yes, Frank, of course
I'm listening to you.

874
00:41:57,426 --> 00:41:58,993
Yeah... yes.

875
00:41:59,094 --> 00:42:00,612
I love listening
to you, Frank.

876
00:42:00,713 --> 00:42:04,533
- [yapping]
- Shh! Sit. Sit.

877
00:42:05,585 --> 00:42:06,551
No, not you, Frank.

878
00:42:06,652 --> 00:42:08,387
- No, no.
- [barking]

879
00:42:08,488 --> 00:42:10,188
Frank, if I may
get down to it, OK...

880
00:42:10,323 --> 00:42:13,641
I think it would be
a mistake to back out.

881
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:16,678
- Because, Frank,
for so many years...
- [eagle screeching]

882
00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:19,431
...you have inspired me
with your beautiful words,

883
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:20,782
- and I feel that...
- [barking]

884
00:42:20,883 --> 00:42:22,283
Shh! Dog, I'm on the phone.

885
00:42:22,385 --> 00:42:25,303
I think it's time that the world
get to enjoy your words as well.

886
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:27,805
- They are just so rich
with... passion...
- [dog barking]

887
00:42:28,123 --> 00:42:32,577
And I think that we
should all be privy to.

888
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:34,178
- Frank, I just, uh...
- [screeching]

889
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:35,947
I just, uh, want you
to be happy, Frank.

890
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:38,684
Give me that dog!

891
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:40,869
Frank, hold on a second.
Can you hold a second?

892
00:42:41,321 --> 00:42:42,220
Give me that dog!

893
00:42:43,756 --> 00:42:45,190
Come on! Come on,
come on, come on.

894
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:47,675
- Come on! Come on! Oh, oh...
- [squeaking]

895
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:50,211
Oh, oh! Oh, oh.
OK! OK, gotcha.

896
00:42:50,312 --> 00:42:52,013
Frank, Frank.

897
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:53,214
Frank? So sorry, so sorry.

898
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:56,468
So sorry. I dropped the phone.
Now, listen, Frank.

899
00:42:56,569 --> 00:42:59,253
I don't want to
sell you on anything,

900
00:42:59,354 --> 00:43:01,072
but this is your
legacy, this book.

901
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:02,373
And I think
it's up to you to

902
00:43:02,608 --> 00:43:03,492
present your legacy
to the world.

903
00:43:03,593 --> 00:43:06,628
And call me tomorrow
with your decision.

904
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:08,529
And my phone is on
all the time! OK, bye-bye.

905
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:10,031
No! Wait!

906
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:12,868
No! No! N-n-n... no. No

907
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:14,435
Take the doggy.
Look at the doggy.

908
00:43:14,536 --> 00:43:16,270
I need that phone.
Take the dog.

909
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:18,056
Take the dog.
I need that phone!

910
00:43:18,157 --> 00:43:21,559
Here. Take the dog.
Take the dog. Take it. Take it.

911
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,695
[Grace] Look at this.

912
00:43:23,796 --> 00:43:24,312
[both laughing]

913
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:27,632
- Is that cute or what?
- I know.

914
00:43:29,435 --> 00:43:32,104
Morning, guys.
Have you seen... daah.

915
00:43:32,205 --> 00:43:35,340
She's playing with Kevin.
We thought she didn't like him.

916
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:36,407
Will you
go get her, Andy?

917
00:43:36,508 --> 00:43:38,409
We have a whole day
planned for her,

918
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:40,378
and she needs
to get ready.

919
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:42,647
Yeah. Tell her we have
a big surprise for her.

920
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:44,549
Mmm.

921
00:43:46,986 --> 00:43:49,921
Look! Give me my phone. Come on.
Please, just give me my phone.

922
00:43:50,022 --> 00:43:52,440
- Come on. Right here.
- What the hell are you doing?

923
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:55,477
Oh, my God. Your grandmother
was completely right.

924
00:43:55,578 --> 00:43:57,429
The eagle came and
tried to take the dog.

925
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:00,949
But then I saved him. Then it
came back, and it took my phone.

926
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:03,284
- Are you drunk?
- What? No! I'm serious.

927
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:05,487
He's got my phone, and Frank's
calling me on that phone.

928
00:44:05,588 --> 00:44:08,723
Relax, all right? We'll order
another phone, same number.

929
00:44:08,825 --> 00:44:09,624
We'll go into town
tomorrow and get it.

930
00:44:09,725 --> 00:44:11,193
- Really?
- OK? Yeah.

931
00:44:11,294 --> 00:44:16,597
- Oh, OK. All right.
Well, you go then.
- [barks]

932
00:44:16,699 --> 00:44:18,399
- You have to get ready.
- For what?

933
00:44:18,734 --> 00:44:19,951
You're going out
with Mom and the girls.

934
00:44:20,052 --> 00:44:21,085
I don't want to go out.

935
00:44:21,186 --> 00:44:22,453
Shopping, sightseeing.
And a surprise.

936
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:24,055
- I hate shopping.
- You'll love it.

937
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:25,457
- I hate sightseeing.
- You're going.

938
00:44:25,558 --> 00:44:26,925
- No, I don't want to go.
- You're going.

939
00:44:27,026 --> 00:44:28,543
- I'm not going. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

940
00:44:28,644 --> 00:44:29,978
Now give me a nice big hug.
We don't want them

941
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,279
- to think we're fighting.
- I don't want to touch you.

942
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:32,981
- Come on. Hug time.
- No, I don't want to...

943
00:44:33,082 --> 00:44:34,916
- Hug time.
- I don't want to...

944
00:44:35,017 --> 00:44:36,651
There we go.

945
00:44:36,753 --> 00:44:39,387
Yeah, that's nice.

946
00:44:39,488 --> 00:44:42,157
Yeah. That's nice.

947
00:44:42,257 --> 00:44:44,625
There we go.
Isn't that nice?

948
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,111
- Mmm-hmm.
- [Andrew] Mmm-hmm.

949
00:44:46,212 --> 00:44:47,812
- [Margaret] Mmm. Yeah.
- [Andrew] Boop boop boop.

950
00:44:47,913 --> 00:44:50,115
If you touch my ass
one more time,

951
00:44:50,216 --> 00:44:52,567
I will cut your balls
off in your sleep. OK?

952
00:44:52,668 --> 00:44:53,985
- Yeah.
- There you go.

953
00:44:54,086 --> 00:44:56,754
All righty now. So, uh...
We clear on that?

954
00:44:56,855 --> 00:44:59,324
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Such a good fiancé.

955
00:44:59,425 --> 00:45:01,326
Hmm. Ow.

956
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:10,969
[splashing]

957
00:45:14,574 --> 00:45:17,809
- [Joe] Jeez.
- You want to see me?

958
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,579
Your mom found
these eco-balls.

959
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,481
They dissolve in water.

960

[grunts]

961
00:45:24,149 --> 00:45:26,818
I don't know how she
comes up with this stuff.

962
00:45:27,052 --> 00:45:30,838
Anyway, she, uh...
is a little peeved.

963
00:45:30,939 --> 00:45:34,875
Apparently, I wasn't the most
gracious of hosts last night.

964
00:45:34,977 --> 00:45:36,211
It was a little
bit of a shock

965
00:45:36,312 --> 00:45:37,795
to find out that
you're getting married...

966
00:45:38,063 --> 00:45:41,333
...especially when none of us
even knew you were dating.

967
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:46,238
The point is...
I owe you an apology.

968
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:49,757
Accepted.

969
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:52,493
There's something else.

970
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:56,363
I've been going over my
retirement plans recently,

971
00:45:56,465 --> 00:45:58,365
and it got me
thinking.

972
00:45:59,618 --> 00:46:01,152
I've done a lot
of things in my life.

973
00:46:01,253 --> 00:46:04,889
Practically built an empire with
your mother from the ground up.

974
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,023
It doesn't mean
anything unless...

975
00:46:06,258 --> 00:46:07,525
Unless you have
someone to leave it to.

976
00:46:07,626 --> 00:46:10,996
- We already discussed this.
- I'd like to discuss it again.

977
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:14,983
You have
responsibilities here.

978
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:16,785
I think I've been
more than understanding

979
00:46:16,886 --> 00:46:18,219
about your goofing off
in New York.

980
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,854
I need you to quit
playing around...

981
00:46:19,955 --> 00:46:20,989
Here we go again.

982
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:21,990
When are you going to start

983
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:23,158
taking what I do seriously?

984
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:25,293
When you start
acting seriously.

985
00:46:25,394 --> 00:46:27,779
I'm sorry.

986
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,797
I feel sorry for you, Dad.

987
00:46:29,898 --> 00:46:32,317
I wish you had
another son. I really do.

988
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:33,518
One who wanted
to stay here.

989
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:35,286
One who wanted to take over
the family business.

990
00:46:35,387 --> 00:46:37,438
One who wanted
to marry someone
that you approve of,

991
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,808
but it's not me. Now,
it must seem strange to you,

992
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:45,780
my life in New York... sitting
in an office, reading books.

993
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:48,599
But it makes me happy.
You understand?

994
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:55,073
If that's what makes you happy,
son, I got nothing to say.

995
00:46:55,173 --> 00:46:57,241
Well, that's a first.

996
00:46:57,342 --> 00:47:02,046
You know what? Apology not
accepted. Have fun out here.

[Grace] There is no way you
could leave her at home.

1000
00:47:17,696 --> 00:47:19,464
She had to be here.
Absolutely.

1001
00:47:19,564 --> 00:47:21,532
She's been
coming here forever.

1002
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:24,268
I hope you are ready
for your big surprise...

1003
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,538
...because this is one of
Sitka's greatest treasures.

1004

Well, I mean, we dated in high
school and all through college,

but we were kids.

it off because of...

Well, um...

1074
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,771
the night before we graduated
school, he proposed...

1075
00:51:03,872 --> 00:51:05,339
...and said he
wanted to elope

1076
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,176
and run away to
New York with me.

And...

You said "no."

I've never been anywhere

you're a lucky girl.

He really is the best, which
you obviously already know.

00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:34,535
Oh, yep.
Yep, very much so, yeah.

1084
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:37,939
Well, cheers to you guys.

1085
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,643
Oh... Thank you.

I've never
seen him so...

1091
00:51:57,142 --> 00:51:59,209
- No, he really got down.

Andrew, honey,
is everything OK?

What...
What's he doing?

Something's up. It's best

Come on, honey.
