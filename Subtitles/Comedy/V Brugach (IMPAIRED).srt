00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,014
It's a Dutch movie.
It's a dream sequence.

161
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,436
It's a pastiche of Nicholas Roeg's
<i>Don't Look Now.</i>

162
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:10,489
Not a pastiche, but a...

163
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:15,084
A 'homage' is too strong.
A 'nod of the head'?

164
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,794
Wow, your English is very good.

165
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,166
A lot of midgets
tend to kill themselves.

166
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,939
A disproportionate amount.

167
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,503
Hervé Villechaize,
<i>off of Fantasy Island.</i>

168
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,600
I think somebody
<i>off The Time Bandits.</i>

169
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,950
I suppose they must
get really sad about, like,

170
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,039
being really little and that.

171
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,707
People looking at them
and laughing at them.

172
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:52,059
Calling them names.
You know, 'shortarse.'

173
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,792
There's another famous
midget I'm missing,
but I can't remember.

174
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,769
It's not the R2-D2 man.
No, he's still going.

175
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:07,772
I hope your midget doesn't kill himself.
Your dream sequence will be fucked.

176
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,961
He doesn't like being called a midget.
He prefers 'dwarf.'

177
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:13,435
Well, this is exactly my point!

178
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:16,635
People go around calling you a midget
when you want to be called a dwarf.

179
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:19,555
Of course you're
gonna blow your head off!

180
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,023
- My name's Ray. What's yours?
- Chloe.

181
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,180
How did you get past
the security man?

182
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,585
Getting past security men,
it's sort of my job.

183
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:32,621
You're a shoplifter?

184
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:34,752
(CHUCKLES) No, not a shoplifter.

185
00:14:34,852 --> 00:14:36,808
It's a good joke, though.

186
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,936
No.

187
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,496
I'll tell you what I am
at dinner tomorrow night.

188
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:43,980

189
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,891
Fuck.

190
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,709
How fucking cool.

191
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,574
Mr. Blakely?

192
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:31,357
- Yes. No, Mr. Cranham.
- No. Yes. Mr. Blakely. Yes.

193
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,131
You have a message.

194
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,499
Shit!

195
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,559
<i>HARRY: Number one, why aren't you
in when I fucking told you to be in?</i>

196
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:49,761
<i>Number two, why doesn't this hotel
have phones with fucking voicemail</i>

197
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:52,599
<i>and not I have to leave messages
with the fucking receptionist?</i>

198

(SOFTLY) You'll never guess what.

206

Will you shut your fucking mouth,

207
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,719
Oh, sorry.

208
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,223
Except I've gotta take me
contact lenses out.

209
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,792
Altogether,

210
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:25,343
I had

211
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,579
five pints of beer
and six bottles.

212
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:35,368
No. Six pints of beer
and seven bottles.

213
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:38,082
And you know what?
I'm not even pissed!

214
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,191
You'll never guess what, Ken.

215
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,981
- Ken, you'll never guess what.
- What?

216
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:51,183
Got a date for tomorrow night.

217
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:52,350
I'm very happy for you.

218
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,552
With a girl.

219
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:54,901
Can you turn
the light off, please?

220
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,859
Only been in Bruges one day, got a date
with a girl in the film business,

221
00:17:57,959 --> 00:18:00,002
the Belgian film business.

222
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,805
They're doing a film about a midget.

223
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,293
Miss?

224
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,296
Marie?

225
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:32,977
Sorry about the message last night.
The man who left it is a bit of a...

226
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,437
Well, he's a bit of a...

227
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,141
Cock?

228
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,343
Yes. He's a bit of a cock.

229
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,851
Morning.

230
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,125
Harry called last night.

231
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,293
We missed him.

232
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,575
Jeez, he swears a lot, doesn't he?

233
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,837
We're staying in tonight.
Whatever happens.

234
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,642
Hmm.

235
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,315
Except...

236
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,185
Hmm.
Hmm.

237
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,936
Except 'hmm' what?

238
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:23,777
Except only one of us
needs to stay in, really.

239
00:19:23,877 --> 00:19:25,090
Uh-huh.

240
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,314
And which one of us
would that be, now, Ray?

241
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:30,819
I thought you didn't like Bruges.

242
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,686
I don't like Bruges,
it's a shithole.

243
00:19:32,786 --> 00:19:36,557
But I did already say I had a date
with a Belgian lady

244
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:40,703
in the Belgian film business,
which I did already say about before.

245
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,900
Just don't get into
any fucking trouble.

246
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,113
We're keeping a low profile.

247
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:54,440
And this morning,
and this afternoon,

248
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,877
we are doing what I want to do.

249
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:58,725
- Got it?
- Of course.

250
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,483
Which, I presume,
will involve culture.

251
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:05,284
Oh, we shall strike a balance
between culture and fun.

252
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:09,932
Somehow I believe, Ken, that the
balance shall tip in the favor of culture.

253
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,796
Like a big, fat, fucking retarded,
fucking black girl

254
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:17,576
on a seesaw, opposite

255
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,582
a dwarf.

(DRAGGING FEET)

257
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,239
(SOFTLY) Ray, did we
or did we not agree

258
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:02,805
that if I let you
go on your date tonight,

259
00:21:02,905 --> 00:21:04,846
we'd do the things
I wanted to do today?

260
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:06,780
We are doing the things
that you wanted to do today.

261
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,413
And that we'd do them without you
throwing a fucking moody,

262
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:11,852
like some 5-year-old who's dropped
all his sweets?

263
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:13,905
I didn't agree to that.

264
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:16,867
I'll cheer up.
I'll cheer up.

265
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,245
Up there, the top altar, is a phial

266
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,494
brought back by a Flemish knight
from the Crusades in the Holy Land.

267
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:27,165
And that phial, do you know what
it's said to contain?

268
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:28,799
No, what's it
said to contain?

269
00:21:28,899 --> 00:21:32,835
It's said to contain some drops of
Jesus Christ's blood.

270
00:21:32,935 --> 00:21:36,642
Yeah, that's how this church got
its name. Basilica of the Holy Blood.

271
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:38,078
Yeah. Yeah.

272
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:41,030
And this blood, right,
though it's dried blood,

273
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:45,182
at different times over many years,
they say it turned back into liquid.

274
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:47,919
Turned back into liquid
from dried blood.

- Do you have to?
- Of course you don't have to.

Of course you don't fucking have to!

00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,801
Well...

KEN: I don't know, Ray.
I don't know what I believe.

323
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:42,305
The things you're taught as a child,
they never really leave you, do they?

324
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:44,644
So, like, I believe in trying
to lead a good life.

325
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:48,379
Like, if there's an old lady,
carrying her shopping home,

326
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:52,184
I don't try and help her carry her
shopping, I don't go that far,

327
00:27:52,284 --> 00:27:56,455
but I'll certainly hold
the door open for her and that,
and let her go out before me.

328
00:27:56,555 --> 00:27:58,656
Yeah. And anyway, if you tried to
help her carry her shopping,

329
00:27:58,756 --> 00:28:00,661
she'd probably think you were
just trying to nick her shopping.

330
00:28:00,761 --> 00:28:03,563
Exactly. This is the world
we live in today.

331
00:28:03,663 --> 00:28:06,981
At the same time as trying to lead
a good life,

332
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:12,687
I have to reconcile myself with the
fact that, yes, I have killed people.

333
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,185
Not many people. Most of them were
not very nice people.

334
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,877
Apart from one person.

335
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:21,348
Who's that?

336
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:23,851
This fellow,
Danny Aliband's brother.

337
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:27,383
He was just trying to protect
his brother. Like you or I would.

338
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:29,756
He was just a lollipop man.

339
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:33,289
He came at me with a bottle.
What are you gonna do?

340
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:34,762
I shot him down.

341
00:28:34,862 --> 00:28:35,835
Hmm.

342
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,333
In my book, though, sorry,
someone comes at you with a bottle,

343
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:42,966
that is a deadly weapon,
he's gotta take the consequences.

344
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,438
I know that in my heart.

345
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:46,806
I also know that he was just trying
to protect his brother, you know?

346
00:28:46,906 --> 00:28:49,242
I know. But a bottle,
that can kill you.

347
00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:50,508
It's a case of
it's you or him.

348
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:52,480
If he'd come at you with his
bare hands, that'd be different.

349
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,577
That wouldn't
have been fair.

350
00:28:53,677 --> 00:28:56,016
Well, technically, your bare hands
can kill somebody, too.

351
00:28:56,116 --> 00:28:58,885
They can be deadly weapons, too.
I mean, what if he knew karate, say?

352
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:00,185
You said he was
a lollipop man.

353

He was a lollipop man.

knowing fucking karate?

00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:05,522
I'm just saying.

356
00:29:05,622 --> 00:29:08,158
- How old was he?
- About 50.

357
00:29:08,258 --> 00:29:10,665
What's a 50-year-old lollipop man
doing knowing fucking karate?

358

What was he,
a Chinese lollipop man?

talk about...

I know what you're
trying to talk about.

361
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,949
I killed a little boy.
You keep bringing up fucking lollipop men!

362
00:29:30,049 --> 00:29:31,784
You didn't mean
to kill a little boy.

I know I didn't mean to.

But because of the choices I made and
the course that I put into action,

365

a little boy
isn't here anymore.

not here in Belgium.

Well, he'll never be here in Belgium,
either, will he?

369
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:58,278
I mean, he might have wanted
to come here when he got older.

00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:21,820
We just popped out for some dinner,
Harry. We only popped out for half an hour.

472
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,385
<i>Yeah? What'd you have?</i>

473
00:37:23,485 --> 00:37:25,257
- For dinner?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

474
00:37:25,357 --> 00:37:26,490
Pizza, at Pizza Hut.

475
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,624
<i>Was it nice?</i>

476
00:37:27,724 --> 00:37:29,596
Yeah, it was all right.
I don't know. It was Pizza Hut.

477
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:31,160
The same as in England.

478
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,980
<i>Well, that's globalization,</i>
<i>isn't it? Is Ray there with you?</i>

479
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,604
He's in the toilet.

480
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:39,870
<i>- Can he hear?</i>
- No.

481
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,639
<i>What's he doing?</i>

482
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:44,876
- What do you mean?
<i>- Is he doing a wee or a poo?</i>

483
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:46,577
I don't know, Harry,
the door's closed.

484
00:37:46,677 --> 00:37:50,896
<i>Send him out on an errand for half
an hour, but don't make it sound suspicious.</i>

485
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:53,330
(SIGHS)

486
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,569
Ray? Why don't you go out down
to the pub for half an hour?

487
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,064
Yeah, yeah, I know I said you couldn't,

488
00:38:05,164 --> 00:38:06,878
but might as well enjoy ourselves, eh?

489
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:12,116
No, I don't know if they've got
bowling anywhere.
Could have a look.

490
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,747
Yeah, see you.

491
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,118
Yeah. He's gone.

492
00:38:27,218 --> 00:38:29,454
<i>What'd you say to him?</i>

493
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:31,959
I said, 'Why don't you go have a drink,
you say you've been cooped up?'

494
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,090
<i>- What did he say?</i>
- Said, yeah, he would.

495
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,692
And he might go have a look to see
if there's a bowling alley around.

496
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,395
<i>Was he just having a wee?</i>

497
00:38:38,495 --> 00:38:40,299
Yeah, I think so.
I assume so.

498
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:41,431
<i>Sure he didn't mind?</i>

499
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:43,066
No, he was glad to get out.

500
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,268
<i>He's definitely gone?</i>

501
00:38:44,368 --> 00:38:45,772
Yeah, yeah, he slammed the door.

502
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:49,121
<i>That don't mean he's gone.</i>
<i>Go check outside the door.</i>

503
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,793
Harry, he's definitely gone.

504
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:10,060
<i>You realize there are no</i>
<i>bowling alleys in Bruges?</i>

505
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,628
I realize that, Harry.
The boy wanted to have a look anyway.

506
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,068
<i>What are they gonna have,
a medieval fucking bowling alley?</i>

507
00:39:15,168 --> 00:39:17,436
As I say, I think he was just glad
to get out and about.

508
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:20,502
<i>So, is he having a nice time,
seeing all the canals and that?</i>

509
00:39:20,602 --> 00:39:22,740
<i>I had a lovely time</i>
<i>when I was there.</i>

510
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,341
<i>All the canals and the</i>
<i>old buildings and that.</i>

511
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:26,509
When were you here?

512
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:30,431
<i>When I was seven.</i>
<i>Last happy holiday I fucking had.</i>

513
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,550
<i>- Have you been on a canal trip, yet?</i>
- Yeah.

514
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,819
<i>Have you been down, like,
all the old cobbled streets and that?</i>

515
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:36,953
Yeah.

516
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:39,223
<i>It's like a fairytale,
isn't it, that place?</i>
Yeah.

517
00:39:39,323 --> 00:39:41,228
<i>With the churches and that.</i>
<i>They're Gothic.</i>
Yeah.

518
00:39:41,328 --> 00:39:42,859
<i>- Is it Gothic?</i>
- Yeah.

519
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:45,495
<i>So he's having</i>
<i>a really nice time?</i>

520
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:48,401
Well, I'm having
a really nice time.

521
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:51,250
I'm not sure if it's
really his cup of tea.

522
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,117
<i>What?</i>

523
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:57,606
You know, I'm not sure
if it's really his thing.

524
00:39:57,706 --> 00:39:59,310
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>'It's not really his thing'?</i>

525
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,512
<i>What's that supposed to mean,</i>
<i>'It's not really his thing'?</i>

526
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:02,915
<i>What the fuck is that</i>
<i>supposed to mean?</i>

527
00:40:03,015 --> 00:40:04,013
Nothing, Harry.

528
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:06,182
<i>It's a fairytale</i>
<i>fucking town, isn't it?</i>

529
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:09,020
<i>How can a fairytale town not be
somebody's fucking thing?</i>

530
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,222
<i>How can all those canals and bridges
and cobbled streets and those churches,</i>

531
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:14,559
<i>all that beautiful</i>
<i>fucking fairytale stuff,</i>

532
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:16,530
<i>how can that not be</i>
<i>somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

533
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,930
What I think I meant to say was:

534
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,798
<i>- Is the swan still there?</i>
- Yeah, the swan's...

535
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:23,000
<i>How can fucking swans not fucking
be somebody's fucking thing, eh?</i>

536
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,201
<i>How can that be?</i>

537
00:40:24,301 --> 00:40:25,402
What I think I meant to say was,

538
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:28,639
when he first arrived,
he wasn't quite sure about it.

539
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:32,708
You know, there's that big, dual
carriageway when you get off the train?

540
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:35,047
It mightn't have been here when you
were here last, Harry.

541
00:40:35,147 --> 00:40:38,085
Well, as soon as he got into,
like, the old town proper,

542
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:42,022
and he saw the canals and the bridges and,
you know, the swans and that,

543
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:44,024
well, he just
fucking loved it then.

544
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:47,623
Couldn't get enough of it,
the medieval part of town.

545
00:40:47,723 --> 00:40:52,329
It was just that initial, dual carriageway
thing sort of put him off for a second.

546
00:40:52,429 --> 00:40:54,098
<i>Don't know if I remember</i>
<i>a dual carriageway.</i>

547
00:40:54,198 --> 00:40:55,501
<i>Must be recent.</i>

548
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:56,936
<i>Hasn't spoilt it, has it?</i>

549
00:40:57,036 --> 00:41:00,286
No, no, no, it's just that
initial thing.

550
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,455
And you know what?

551
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:07,811
As we were walking
through the streets,

552
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:13,063
there was this sort of freezing fog
hanging over everything,

553
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:17,289
and it made it look almost like
a fairytale or something.

554
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:18,887
And he turned to me,
do you know what he said?

555
00:41:18,987 --> 00:41:20,523
<i>What'd he say?</i>

556
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:25,628
He said, 'Ken, I know I'm awake,
but I feel like I'm in a dream.'

557
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:28,067
<i>Yeah? He said that?</i>

558
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:29,165
Yeah.

559
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:31,801
<i>Meaning, like,</i>
<i>in a good dream?</i>

560
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:34,741
Yeah. Of course,
like in a good dream.

561
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:38,211
<i>Oh, good: I'm glad</i>
<i>he likes it there.</i>

562
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:40,247
<i>I'm glad we were able</i>
<i>to give him something.</i>

563
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:44,165
<i>Something good and happy. Because he
wasn't a bad kid, was he?</i>

564
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:46,695
Huh?

565
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,337
<i>He wasn't a bad kid,</i>
<i>was he?</i>

566
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,456
<i>Listen, take down this address.</i>
<i>Raamstraat 17.</i>

567
00:41:53,556 --> 00:41:56,604
<i>That's 'Raam,' like 'Ram,'</i>
<i>but with an extra 'a:'</i>

568
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:58,661
Raamstraat 17.

569
00:41:58,761 --> 00:42:00,341
<i>You got that?</i>

570
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,135
Yes, Raamstraat 17.

571
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:06,438
<i>Good: There'll be a man there tomorrow
morning at 9::00, his name's Yuri.</i>

572
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:08,206
- Yuri.
<i>- He'll give you the gun.</i>

573
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:10,177
<i>Ring me on the public phone</i>
<i>at Jimmy Driscoll's</i>

574
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,094
<i>about 3:00 or 4:00 tomorrow,</i>
<i>after it's done.</i>

575
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,725
After what's done?

576
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,196
<i>Are you being thick?</i>

577
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,586
- No.
<i>- Listen, I like Ray.</i>

578
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:24,057
<i>He was a good bloke, but when it
all comes down to it, you know,</i>

579
00:42:24,157 --> 00:42:27,223
<i>he blew the head off a little
fucking kid. And you brought him in, Ken.</i>

580
00:42:27,323 --> 00:42:30,769
<i>So if the buck don't stop with him,</i>
<i>where does it stop?</i>

581
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:37,345
<i>Ken?</i>

582
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,873
<i>If the buck don't stop with him,</i>
<i>where does it stop?</i>

583
00:42:40,973 --> 00:42:42,938
It stops with me, Harry.
That's an easy one.

584
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:45,154
<i>Look, don't get shirty, Ken.</i>

585
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:50,984
<i>Listen, I'm just glad that I was able
to do something for the boy before he went.</i>

586
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:52,683
Do what for the boy?

587
00:42:52,783 --> 00:42:55,204
<i>You know, have him</i>
<i>get to see Bruges.</i>

588
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,203
<i>I'd like to go to see</i>
<i>Bruges again before I die.</i>

589
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:03,504
<i>What was it he said again about:
Yeah, 'It's like a dream:'</i>

590
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:08,547
'I know I'm awake, but I feel like
I'm in a dream.'

591
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,113
<i>Yeah.</i>

592
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,289
<i>Give me a call</i>
<i>when he's dead.</i>

594
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,770
That's my fucking girlfriend,
you asshole.

595
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,069
Eirik, what are you doing?

596
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:46,905
Where are you from, fucker?

597
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:48,458
Ireland, originally.

598
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,509
And you think it's okay
to come over to Belgium

599
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:53,344
and fuck another man's girl?

600
00:43:53,444 --> 00:43:55,247
Look, I didn't know she had
a boyfriend, all right?

601
00:43:55,347 --> 00:43:58,285
And I haven't fucked her, anyway.
Ask her. I'd only put me hand on it.

602
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,337
Eirik, put the gun down!

603
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,957
Get down on your knees
and open your mouth.

604
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:05,588
Don't start being silly.

605
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:07,439
Get down on your:

606
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,928
Exactly at what point was it that
all skinheads suddenly became poofs?

607
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:13,163
Used to be,
you were a skinhead,

608
00:44:13,263 --> 00:44:15,500
you just went around beating up
Pakistani 12-year-olds.

609
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,885
Now it seems a prerequisite
to be a fucking bum-boy!

610
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:21,605
That's not gonna help you, man.

611
00:44:21,705 --> 00:44:24,456
Ray, there's only
blanks in that gun.

612
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,818
Eirik, don't!

613
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:34,186
Now who's the fucking bum-boy?

614
00:44:34,286 --> 00:44:36,501
You, you fucking bum-boy!

(GROANING)

616
00:44:38,691 --> 00:44:40,492
Chloe, what exactly

a blank in your fucking eyes!

- Is this fella your boyfriend?
- No. I mean, he used to be.

Well, what's he doing here?

We... We rob tourists, sometimes.

I fucking knew it was too good
to be true!

I knew you'd have never
shagged me, normally.

624

No! That's not true, I...

625
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:07,820
I called it off tonight.
I told him not to come tonight.

626
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,019
Why did you come tonight?

I swear it!

I haven't had a shag in months!

don't know how long I'll be.

would never like someone like me.

- I just knew.
- What do you mean, someone like me?

You know, someone nice.

Your girlfriend's
very pretty.

She ain't my girlfriend.
She's a prostitute I just picked up.

Didn't know there were
any prostitutes in Bruges.

in the right places.

Well, you've picked up
a very pretty prostitute.

anything too loud or crass.

your sorrows, huh?

How'd your date go?

667
00:48:42,298 --> 00:48:44,502
My date involved two instances of
extreme violence.

668
00:48:44,602 --> 00:48:46,602
One instance of her hand on my cock
and my finger up her thing,

669
00:48:46,702 --> 00:48:49,576
which lasted all too briefly.
Isn't that always the way?

670
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:53,046
One instance of me stealing five grams of
her very-high-quality cocaine,

671
00:48:53,146 --> 00:48:55,278
and one instance of me
blinding a poofy little skinhead.

672
00:48:55,378 --> 00:48:58,549
So, all in all, my evening
pretty much balanced out fine.

673
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:00,728
You got five grams of coke?

674
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,187
I've got four grams on me
and one gram in me,

675
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:04,556
which is why me heart
is going like the clappers,

676
00:49:04,656 --> 00:49:05,856
as if I'm about to
have a heart attack.

677
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:08,125
So if I collapse any minute now,
please remember to tell the doctors

678
00:49:08,225 --> 00:49:09,826
that it might have something
to do with the coke.

679
00:49:09,926 --> 00:49:11,331
Give us a gram, then.

680
00:49:11,431 --> 00:49:13,367

because it makes you depressed?

You know what? Right now,
I don't really give a fuck.

682

Why didn't you wave hello to me
today when I waved hello to you today?

I was on a very strong
horse tranquilizer today.

I wasn't waving hello to anybody,
except maybe to a horse.

Huh? What are you
talking about?

hold it against me.

00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:52,355

It's kind of like 'nooks and crannies.'

774
00:56:52,455 --> 00:56:56,526

Perhaps this would be more accurate.

775
00:56:56,626 --> 00:57:00,014
'Nooks and crannies,'
rather than 'alcoves.' Yeah.

Your friend was behaving
rather oddly this morning.

780

Oddly? How?

781
00:57:35,196 --> 00:57:39,315
Well, he asked me about the baby,
and if I wanted a boy or a girl.

782
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:43,542
I said I didn't mind as long as
it's healthy, of course.

783
00:57:43,642 --> 00:57:47,960
But then he gave me 200 euros
to give to the baby.

784
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:54,369
I refused, obviously,
but he was quite insistent.

785
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:59,266
Would you give it back to him
when you see him?

786
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:04,025
I don't want to appear ungrateful, but it
seemed like all the money he had.

- Do you know where he is now?
- He said he was going to the park.

Dumdums, yeah.

931
01:11:06,944 --> 01:11:09,523
Would you like some
of these dumdums?

932
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,795
I know I shouldn't,

933
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,800
but I will.

934
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,275
Motherfucker.

935
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:23,591
Is he talking to me?

936
01:11:23,691 --> 01:11:25,827
No, Eirik's on your side,
Mr. Waters.

937
01:11:25,927 --> 01:11:27,928
Your young friend
blinded him last night.

938
01:11:28,028 --> 01:11:29,063
Ray did?

939
01:11:29,163 --> 01:11:32,450
I was trying to rob him
and he took my gun from me.

940
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:36,073
And the gun
was full of blanks,

941
01:11:36,173 --> 01:11:37,785
and he shot the blank
into my eye.

942
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:43,456
And now, I cannot see from this eye
ever again, the doctors say.

943
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:47,484
Well, to be honest, it sounds like
it was all your fault.

944
01:11:47,584 --> 01:11:48,582
What?

945
01:11:48,682 --> 01:11:51,455
I mean, basically, if you're robbing
a man and you're only carrying blanks,

946
01:11:51,555 --> 01:11:53,458
and you allow your gun
to be taken off you,

947
01:11:53,558 --> 01:11:55,758
and you allow yourself to be shot
in the eye with a blank,

948
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:59,393
for which I assume the person has to get
quite close to you, then,

949
01:11:59,493 --> 01:12:02,732
yeah, really, it's all your fault
for being such a poof.

950
01:12:02,832 --> 01:12:05,737
So why don't you stop whingeing
and cheer the fuck up?

951
01:12:05,837 --> 01:12:08,381
YURI: Eirik, I really wouldn't respond.

952
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:16,712
I thought you wanted the guy dead?

953
01:12:16,812 --> 01:12:18,914
I do want the guy dead.
I want him fucking crucified.

954
01:12:19,014 --> 01:12:22,286
But it don't change the fact
that he stitched you up like
a blind, little gay boy.

955
01:12:22,386 --> 01:12:23,395
Does it?

956
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,332
Thanks for the gun, Yuri.

957
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:35,435
Well?

958
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,497
The boy is suicidal, Harry.

959
01:13:39,597 --> 01:13:41,572
He's a walking dead man.

960
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,398
Keeps going on
about Hell and purgatory:

961
01:13:44,498 --> 01:13:46,871
When I phoned you
yesterday, did I ask you,

962
01:13:46,971 --> 01:13:50,504
'Ken, will you do me a favor and
become Ray's psychiatrist, please?'

963
01:13:50,604 --> 01:13:55,075
No. What I think I asked you was,
'Could you go blow his fucking head off for me?'

964
01:13:55,175 --> 01:13:57,144
'He's suicidal'?

965
01:13:57,244 --> 01:14:00,714
I'm suicidal. You're suicidal.
Everybody's fucking suicidal!

966
01:14:00,814 --> 01:14:02,985
We don't all keep
going on about it!

967
01:14:03,085 --> 01:14:07,425
Has he killed himself yet?
No. So he's not fucking suicidal, is he?

968
01:14:07,525 --> 01:14:09,894
He put a loaded gun to his head this morning.
I stopped him.

969
01:14:09,994 --> 01:14:12,503
He... What?
This gets fucking worse!

970
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:14,495
We were down in the park...

971
01:14:14,595 --> 01:14:18,531
Let me get this right.
You were down in the park?

972
01:14:18,631 --> 01:14:20,735
What's that got to do
with fucking anything?

973
01:14:20,835 --> 01:14:23,675
Let me get this right. Not only
have you refused to kill the boy,

974
01:14:23,775 --> 01:14:25,941
you've even stopped the boy
from killing himself,

975
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:27,276
which would have
solved my problem,

976
01:14:27,376 --> 01:14:28,611
which would have
solved your problem,

977
01:14:28,711 --> 01:14:30,582
which sounds like
it would've solved
the boy's problem.

978
01:14:30,682 --> 01:14:32,280
It wouldn't have
solved his problem.

979
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:36,316
Ken, if I had killed a little kid,
accidentally or otherwise,

980
01:14:36,416 --> 01:14:37,620
I wouldn't have thought twice.

981
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,220
I'd have killed myself on the
fucking spot. On the fucking spot.

982
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,958
I'd have stuck the gun in me mouth
on the fucking spot!

983
01:14:43,058 --> 01:14:46,661
That's you, Harry.
The boy has the capacity to change.

984
01:14:46,761 --> 01:14:49,200
The boy has the capacity to do
something decent with his life.

985
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:52,720
Excuse me, Ken.
I have the capacity to change.

986
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:57,050
Yeah, you do. You've the capacity
to get fucking worse!

987
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:00,140
Yeah, now I'm
getting down to it!

988
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,113
Harry, let's face it.

989
01:15:02,213 --> 01:15:04,880
And I'm not being funny,
I mean no disrespect,

990
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:06,384
but you're a cunt.

991
01:15:06,484 --> 01:15:09,286
You're a cunt now,
you've always been a cunt.

992
01:15:09,386 --> 01:15:13,089
And the only thing that's
gonna change is you're gonna
become an even bigger cunt.

993
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:14,654
Maybe have some
more cunt kids.

994
01:15:14,754 --> 01:15:16,824
Leave my kids fucking out of it.
What have they done?

995
01:15:16,924 --> 01:15:19,330
You fucking retract that bit
about my cunt fucking kids!

996
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:21,664
I retract that bit about
your cunt fucking kids.

997
01:15:21,764 --> 01:15:25,434
Insulting my fucking kids!
That's going overboard, mate!

998
01:15:25,534 --> 01:15:27,512
I retracted it, didn't I?

999
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:31,739
Still leaves you being a cunt.

1000
01:15:31,839 --> 01:15:34,387
Yeah, I fucking got that.

1001

Where's Ray now?

1002
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:58,533
Oh, right about now,
Ray is in one or other

- No, Harry.
