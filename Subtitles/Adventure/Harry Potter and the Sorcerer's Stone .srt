1
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:26,161
I should've known that you would be

2
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:29,455
here, Professor McGonagall.

3
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,848
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

4
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:47,084
Are the rumors true, Albus?

5
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:52,556
I'm afraid so, professor. The good and
the bad.

6
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:55,993
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

7
00:01:55,994 --> 00:02:00,431
Is it wise to trust Hagrid with
something so important?

8
00:02:00,432 --> 00:02:07,869
Professor, I would trust Hagrid with
my life.

9
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:28,526
Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor
McGonagall.

10
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:32,630
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

11
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:37,902
Little tyke fell asleep as we were
flying over Bristol.

12
00:02:37,903 --> 00:02:41,138
Try not to wake him.

13
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:45,698
There you go.

14
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:53,450
Do you really think it's safe, leaving
him with these people?

15
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:58,889
I've watched them all day. They're the
worst sort of Muggles.

16
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,127
- They really are-
- The only family he has.

17
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:08,299
He'll be famous. Every child in our
world will know his name.

18
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,234
Exactly.

19
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:17,001
He's far better off growing up away
from all of that.

20
00:03:17,008 --> 00:03:22,204
Until he's ready.

21
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:39,751
There, there, Hagrid. It's not really
goodbye, after all.

22
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:51,275
Good luck...

23
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:56,301
...Harry Potter.

24
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:16,832
Up. Get up!

25
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:20,992
Now!

26
00:04:32,183 --> 00:04:38,050
Wake up, cousin! We're going to the
zoo!

27
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:53,871
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

28
00:04:53,872 --> 00:04:57,207
Cook breakfast. And try not to burn
anything.

29
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:02,379
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

30
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,549
...for my Dudley's special day!

31
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:11,689
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

32
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,994
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

33
00:05:16,995 --> 00:05:20,731
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

34
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:24,134
36?! But last year I had 37!

35
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:27,065
- But some are bigger than last
year's.

36
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,238
- I don't care!

37
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,975
This is what we're going to do.

38
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:37,314
We're going to buy you two new
presents. How's that, pumpkin?

39
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:41,570
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.

40
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:45,378
I'm really looking forward to it.

41
00:05:46,224 --> 00:05:48,425
I'm warning you now, boy.

42
00:05:48,426 --> 00:05:52,162
Any funny business, any at all...

43
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:55,833
...and you won't have any meals for a
week.

44
00:05:55,834 --> 00:06:00,029
Get in.

45
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:09,643
Make it move.

46
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:11,749
Move!

47
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,451
- Move!
- He's asleep!

48
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:19,423
He's boring.

49
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:21,091
Sorry about him.

50
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:25,362
He doesn't understand what it's like,
lying there...

51
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:31,697
...watching people press their ugly
faces in on you.

52
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:37,074
Can you hear me?

53
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:41,612
It's just, I've never talked to a
snake before.

54
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,247
Do you...?

55
00:06:43,248 --> 00:06:48,452
Do you talk to people often?

56
00:06:48,453 --> 00:06:51,989
You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it
nice there?

57
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,822
Do you miss your family?

58
00:06:57,128 --> 00:07:02,099
I see. That's me as well. I never knew
my parents either.

59
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:09,560
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe what
this snake is doing!

60
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:32,396
Thanks.

61
00:07:32,397 --> 00:07:36,364
Anytime.

62
00:07:37,168 --> 00:07:41,602
Snake!

63
00:07:54,552 --> 00:07:58,122
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

64
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:01,792
My darling boy! How did you get in
there?

65
00:08:01,793 --> 00:08:09,390
Who did this? How did you get in
there? Is there a snake?

66
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:15,616
It's all right, sweetheart. We'll get

67
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:18,809
you out of these cold clothes.

68
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,945
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

69
00:08:21,946 --> 00:08:28,314
The glass was there and then it was
gone, like magic.

70
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:35,622
There's no such thing as magic.

71
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:12,663
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

72
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:16,133
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

73
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:21,364
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

74
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:57,196
No more mail through this letterbox.

75
00:10:06,884 --> 00:10:12,148
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

76
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,752
Shoo! Go on.

77
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:43,620
Fine day, Sunday.

78
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:48,492
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

79
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:53,130
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

80
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:57,301
No post on Sunday.

81
00:10:57,302 --> 00:11:01,772
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

82
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:09,267
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

83
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:21,555
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable--

84
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:34,571
Make it stop, please!

85
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:39,006
Stop it!

86
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:46,070
Mummy, what's happening?

87
00:11:47,018 --> 00:11:53,852
Give me that! Give me that letter!

88
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:58,222
Get off!

89
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:04,468
They're my letters! Let go of me!

90
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:08,171
That's it! We're going away!

91
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:12,042
Far away, where they can't find us!

92
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:17,808
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

93
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:54,980
Make a wish, Harry.

94
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:13,124
Who's there?

95
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,748
Sorry about that.

96
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,211
I demand that you leave at once. You

97
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:39,219
are breaking and entering.

98
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:44,931
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

99
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:51,341
I haven't seen you since you was a
baby, Harry.

100
00:13:51,342 --> 00:13:53,470
You're a bit more along than I

101
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:56,079
expected. Particularly in the middle.

102
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,784
I'm not Harry.

103
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:05,222
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

104
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:07,090
Got something for you.

105
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:11,227
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine

106
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:15,120
it'll taste fine just the same.

107
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:21,067
Baked it myself, words and all.

108
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:25,442
Thank you.

109
00:14:25,443 --> 00:14:32,004
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

110
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:49,065
Excuse me, but who are you?

111
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:54,204
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
Grounds at Hogwarts.

112
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:58,542
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

113
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:03,680
Didn't you ever wonder where your mum
and dad learned it all?

114
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:05,282
Learned what?

115
00:15:05,283 --> 00:15:09,019
You're a wizard, Harry.

116
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,321
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

117
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:14,558
A good one, I'd wager, once you're
trained up.

118
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,661
No, you've made a mistake. I mean...

119
00:15:17,662 --> 00:15:21,264
...I can't be a wizard.

120
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:27,137
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

121
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:31,374
Well, Just Harry, did you ever make
anything happen?

122
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:38,471
Anything you couldn't explain, when
you were angry or scared?

123
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,765
"Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to
accept you...

124
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:59,202
...at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
and Wizardry."

125
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:01,940
He will not be going! We swore we'd

126
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:04,374
put a stop to all this rubbish.

127
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:08,812
You knew? You knew all along and you
never told me?

128
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:12,115
Of course we knew. How could you not
be?

129
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:16,052
My perfect sister being who she was.

130
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:19,853
My mother and father were so proud the

131
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,192
day she got her letter.

132
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:26,563
"We have a witch in the family. Isn't
it wonderful?"

133
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:30,433
I was the only one to see her for what
she was.

134
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:32,369
A freak!

135
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,206
Then she met that Potter, and then she
had you...

136
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:38,932
...and I knew you would be the same.

137
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:41,511
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

138
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:44,754
And then she got herself blown up, and

139
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,750
we got landed with you.

140
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:50,954
Blown up? You told me my parents died
in a car crash.

141
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:55,492
A car crash? A car crash killed Lily
and James Potter?

142
00:16:55,493 --> 00:16:59,562
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!

143
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:02,298
He'll not be going.

144
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:05,802
A great Muggle like you is going to
stop him?

145
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:07,137
Muggle?

146
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:09,418
Non-magic folk. This boy's had his

147
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,374
name down since he were born.

148
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:15,478
He's going to the finest school of
witchcraft and wizardry.

149
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:18,515
He'll be under the finest headmaster

150
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:21,552
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

151
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:24,408
I will not pay to have a crackpot old

152
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:26,589
fool teach him magic tricks.

153
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:31,361
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

154
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:35,887
...in front of me.

155
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:54,258
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell

156
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:56,753
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

157
00:17:56,754 --> 00:18:02,192
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

158
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:07,628
We're a bit behind schedule. Best be
off.

159
00:18:11,335 --> 00:18:17,066
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

160
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:32,322
"All students must be equipped with...

161
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:35,492
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

162
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:38,540
...and may bring, if they desire,

163
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,498
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

164
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:44,334
Can we find all this in London?

165
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:49,201
If you know where to go.

166
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:12,662
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

167
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:16,766
No, thanks, Tom. I'm on official
Hogwarts business.

168
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:20,036
Just helping Harry buy his school
supplies.

169
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:26,132
Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter!

170
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:31,581
Welcome back, Mr. Potter. Welcome
back.

171
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:36,419
Doris Crockford. I can't believe I'm
meeting you at last.

172
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,858
Harry Potter. Can't tell you how
pleased I am to meet you.

173
00:19:41,859 --> 00:19:44,561
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

174
00:19:44,562 --> 00:19:46,937
Professor Quirrell will be your

175
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:49,833
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

176
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:52,468
Oh, nice to meet you.

177
00:19:52,469 --> 00:19:55,772
Fearfully fascinating subject.

178
00:19:55,773 --> 00:20:01,344
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

179
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:05,715
Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to
buy.

180
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:09,979
Goodbye.

181
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:13,990
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

182
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:17,627
All those people, how is it they know
who I am?

183
00:20:17,628 --> 00:20:23,962
I'm not sure I'm the right person to
tell you that.

184
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:44,715
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

185
00:20:58,535 --> 00:21:01,271
Here, you get your quills and ink.

186
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:07,731
Over there, all your bits and bobs for
doing wizardry.

187
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,535
It's a world-class racing broom.

188
00:21:32,536 --> 00:21:36,639
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

189
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,439
It's the fastest model yet.

190
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,451
But how am I to pay for all this? I
haven't any money.

191
00:21:48,452 --> 00:21:52,088
There's your money. Gringotts, the
wizard bank.

192
00:21:52,089 --> 00:22:00,027
Ain't no safer place, not one. Except
perhaps Hogwarts.

193
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,410
Hagrid, what exactly are these things?

194
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:17,200
They're goblins. Clever as they come,

195
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:19,916
but not the most friendly of beasts.

196
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:24,317
Best stay close.

197
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:32,053
Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a
withdrawal.

198
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:37,900
And does Mr. Harry Potter have his
key?

199
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:43,632
Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere.

200
00:22:43,974 --> 00:22:47,010
Ha! There's the little devil.

201
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:51,147
And there's something else as well.

202
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:56,981
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

203
00:22:58,522 --> 00:23:04,894
It's about You-Know-What in vault
you-know-which.

204
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:09,363
Very well.

205
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:16,806
Vault 687.

206
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:21,605
Lamp, please.

207
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:31,483
Key, please.

208
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:57,413
Did you think your parents would leave
you with nothing?

209
00:23:57,414 --> 00:24:01,384
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

210
00:24:01,385 --> 00:24:05,755
Can't tell you. Hogwarts business.
Very secret.

211
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:09,814
Stand back.

212
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:40,917
Best not to mention this to anyone.

213
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:50,967
I still need a wand.

214
00:24:50,968 --> 00:24:55,304
A wand? You want Ollivanders. There
ain't no place better.

215
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:59,131
Run along there and wait. I got one

216
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:02,640
more thing to do. Won't be long.

217
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:22,493
Hello?

218
00:25:22,966 --> 00:25:27,331
Hello?

219
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:35,138
I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr.
Potter.

220
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,852
It seems only yesterday...

221
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:47,516
...that your mother and father were in

222
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:51,223
here buying their first wands.

223
00:25:55,365 --> 00:26:00,163
Here we are.

224
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:11,301
Give it a wave.

225
00:26:15,252 --> 00:26:20,346
Apparently not.

226
00:26:25,262 --> 00:26:29,165
Perhaps...

227
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:33,827
...this.

228
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:45,472
No, no, definitely not. No matter.

229
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,312
I wonder....

230
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:23,619
Curious.

231
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,756
Very curious.

232
00:27:26,757 --> 00:27:31,527
Sorry, but what's curious?

233
00:27:31,528 --> 00:27:35,097
I remember every wand I've ever sold,
Mr. Potter.

234
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:38,034
It so happens that the phoenix...

235
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:40,992
...whose tail feather resides in your

236
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,172
wand, gave another feather.

237
00:27:43,173 --> 00:27:46,475
Just one other.

238
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:51,013
It is curious that you should be
destined for this wand...

239
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:58,554
...when its brother gave you that
scar.

240
00:27:58,555 --> 00:28:02,625
And who owned that wand?

241
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:05,494
We do not speak his name.

242
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:09,198
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr.
Potter.

243
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:12,568
It's not always clear why.

244
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:16,238
But I think it is clear...

245
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:20,376
...that we can expect great things
from you.

246
00:28:20,377 --> 00:28:24,880
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

247
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:27,717
...did great things.

248
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:30,219
Terrible...

249
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,985
...yes, but great.

250
00:28:39,062 --> 00:28:41,530
Harry! Harry!

251
00:28:41,531 --> 00:28:46,397
Happy birthday.

252
00:28:51,041 --> 00:28:54,877
You all right, Harry? You seem very
quiet.

253
00:28:54,878 --> 00:29:00,716
He killed my parents, didn't he? The
one who gave me this.

254
00:29:00,717 --> 00:29:06,778
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

255
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:12,995
First, and understand this because
it's very important:

256
00:29:12,996 --> 00:29:15,698
Not all wizards are good.

257
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:18,434
Some of them go bad. A few years
ago...

258
00:29:18,435 --> 00:29:21,260
...there was a wizard who went as bad

259
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:23,639
as you can go. His name was V--

260
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,510
- His name was V--
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

261
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,578
No, I can't spell it.

262
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:36,311
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

263
00:29:37,754 --> 00:29:42,358
It was dark times, Harry.

264
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:45,661
Voldemort started to gather some
followers.

265
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:50,433
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

266
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:54,670
Anyone that stood up to him ended up
dead.

267
00:29:54,671 --> 00:29:57,940
Your parents fought against him.

268
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:04,172
But nobody lived once he decided to
kill them.

269
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:08,851
Nobody, not one.

270
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:13,289
Except you.

271
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:17,860
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

272
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:22,298
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on
your forehead, Harry.

273
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:25,463
A mark like that only comes from being

274
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:28,304
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

275
00:30:28,305 --> 00:30:33,042
What happened to V--? To You-Know-Who?

276
00:30:33,043 --> 00:30:36,645
Well, some say he died.

277
00:30:36,646 --> 00:30:39,215
Codswallop, in my opinion.

278
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:42,718
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

279
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:45,888
...too tired to carry on.

280
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:48,748
But one thing's certain. Something

281
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:51,527
about you stumped him that night.

282
00:30:51,528 --> 00:30:54,285
That's why you're famous. That's why

283
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,298
everybody knows your name.

284
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:02,428
You're the boy who lived.

285
00:31:09,246 --> 00:31:13,782
What are you looking at?

286
00:31:13,783 --> 00:31:15,918
Blimey, is that the time?

287
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,189
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

288
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,121
Well, he'll be wanting to see me. Your

289
00:31:23,122 --> 00:31:25,227
train leaves in 10 minutes.

290
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:29,344
Here's your ticket. Stick to your

291
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:33,098
ticket, that's very important.

292
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:35,971
"Platform 9 3/4"?

293
00:31:35,972 --> 00:31:38,943
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.

294
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:40,976
This says platform 9 3/4.

295
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:46,810
There's no such thing, is there?

296
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,868
Sorry.

297
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:08,837
Excuse me. Excuse me.

298
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:10,606
On your left.

299
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:14,643
Can you tell me where I might find
platform 9 3/4?

300
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:17,413
Think you're being funny, do you?

301
00:32:17,414 --> 00:32:21,150
It's the same every year, packed with
Muggles.

302
00:32:21,151 --> 00:32:27,052
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

303
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,923
All right, Percy, you first.

304
00:32:43,373 --> 00:32:44,807
Fred, you next.

305
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:48,677
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

306
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:53,146
I'm sorry, George.

307
00:32:54,818 --> 00:32:59,752
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

308
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:06,695
Excuse me.

309
00:33:06,696 --> 00:33:09,732
Could you tell me how to...?

310
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:13,469
How to get onto the platform? Not to
worry, dear.

311
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,138
It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as
well.

312
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:19,264
All you do is walk straight at the

313
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:22,211
wall between platforms 9 and 10.

314
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:28,170
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

315
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:27,776
Excuse me. Do you mind? Everywhere
else is full.

316
00:34:27,777 --> 00:34:32,507
Not at all.

317
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,718
I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.

318
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:39,722
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

319
00:34:39,723 --> 00:34:41,990
So it's true!

320
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:45,360
I mean, do you really have the...?

321
00:34:45,361 --> 00:34:50,762
- The what?
- The scar?

322
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:56,105
Wicked!

323
00:34:56,106 --> 00:35:03,771
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

324
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:10,113
We'll take the lot.

325
00:35:18,294 --> 00:35:23,499
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

326
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,136
There's chocolate and peppermint and
also...

327
00:35:27,137 --> 00:35:31,206
...spinach, liver and tripe.

328
00:35:31,207 --> 00:35:37,803
George sweared he got a
booger-flavored one once.

329
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:45,554
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.

330
00:35:45,555 --> 00:35:49,007
Each pack's got a famous witch or

331
00:35:49,008 --> 00:35:52,561
wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

332
00:35:52,562 --> 00:35:56,832
Watch it!

333
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:03,133
That's rotten luck. They've only got
one good jump in them.

334
00:36:03,473 --> 00:36:09,178
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

335
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:10,913
Hey, he's gone!

336
00:36:10,914 --> 00:36:15,017
You can't expect him to hang around
all day, can you?

337
00:36:15,018 --> 00:36:18,320
This is Scabbers. Pathetic, isn't he?

338
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:19,721
A little.

339
00:36:19,722 --> 00:36:23,292
Fred gave me a spell to turn him
yellow. Want to see?

340
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:27,784
Yeah.

341
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:34,102
Has anyone seen a toad?

342
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:37,339
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

343
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,711
Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see,
then.

344
00:36:42,712 --> 00:36:47,316
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

345
00:36:47,317 --> 00:36:52,877
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow

346
00:36:53,156 --> 00:36:56,084
Are you sure that's a real spell?

347
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:58,927
Well, it's not very good, is it?

348
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:02,431
I've only tried a few simple ones
myself...

349
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:07,560
...but they've all worked for me.

350
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:11,139
For example:

351
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:16,011
Oculus Reparo.

352
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:19,815
That's better, isn't it?

353
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:23,919
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

354
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,223
I'm Hermione Granger. And you are...?

355
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:31,627
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

356
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:35,709
You two better change into robes. I

357
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:39,225
expect we'll be arriving soon.

358
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:44,506
You've got dirt on your nose. Did you
know?

359
00:37:44,507 --> 00:37:48,998
Just there.

360
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:02,824
Right, then. First years, this way,
please!

361
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:10,558
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

362
00:38:15,004 --> 00:38:19,107
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

363
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:25,942
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

364
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:13,422
Wicked.

365
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:41,556
Welcome to Hogwarts.

366
00:39:41,557 --> 00:39:43,735
Shortly, you'll pass through these

367
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:45,727
doors and join your classmates.

368
00:39:45,728 --> 00:39:48,495
But before you take your seats, you

369
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:51,033
must be sorted into your houses.

370
00:39:51,034 --> 00:39:54,369
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

371
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:59,241
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

372
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:04,913
While you're here, your house will be
like your family.

373
00:40:04,914 --> 00:40:08,617
Your triumphs will earn you points.

374
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:12,954
Any rule-breaking and you will lose
points.

375
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:15,852
At the end of the year, the house with

376
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:18,527
the most points wins the house cup.

377
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:22,290
Trevor!

378
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:30,539
Sorry.

379
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,811
The Sorting Ceremony will begin
momentarily.

380
00:40:35,812 --> 00:40:39,581
It's true then, what they're saying on
the train.

381
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:42,451
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

382
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:44,486
Harry Potter?

383
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:47,389
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

384
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,991
And I'm Malfoy.

385
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:54,262
Draco Malfoy.

386
00:40:54,263 --> 00:40:58,100
Think my name's funny, do you? I've no
need to ask yours.

387
00:40:58,101 --> 00:41:04,806
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe? You
must be a Weasley.

388
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:06,859
You'll find out some wizarding

389
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,044
families are better than others.

390
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:13,014
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

391
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:17,452
I can help you there.

392
00:41:17,453 --> 00:41:23,753
I think I can tell the wrong sort for
myself, thanks.

393
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:31,624
We're ready for you now. Follow me.

394
00:41:47,717 --> 00:41:50,513
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched

395
00:41:50,514 --> 00:41:52,521
to look like the night sky.

396
00:41:52,522 --> 00:41:57,957
I read about it in Hogwarts, A
History.

397
00:42:08,704 --> 00:42:12,974
Will you wait along here, please?

398
00:42:12,975 --> 00:42:15,911
Now, before we begin...

399
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:19,447
...Professor Dumbledore would like to
say a few words.

400
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:24,586
I have a few start-of-term notices I
wish to announce.

401
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:26,988
The first years, please note...

402
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:30,554
...that the Dark Forest is strictly

403
00:42:30,555 --> 00:42:33,228
forbidden to all students.

404
00:42:33,229 --> 00:42:39,000
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has
asked me to remind you...

405
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:43,872
...that the third-floor corridor is
out of bounds...

406
00:42:43,873 --> 00:42:49,511
...to everyone who does not wish to
die a most painful death.

407
00:42:49,512 --> 00:42:53,181
Thank you.

408
00:42:53,182 --> 00:42:57,519
When I call your name, you will come
forth.

409
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,323
I shall place the Sorting Hat on your
head...

410
00:43:01,324 --> 00:43:04,759
...and you will be sorted into your
houses.

411
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,598
Hermione Granger.

412
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,634
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

413
00:43:12,635 --> 00:43:18,502
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

414
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:25,580
Right, then. Right.

415
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:31,676
Okay. Gryffindor!

416
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:43,260
Draco Malfoy.

417
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:48,436
Slytherin!

418
00:43:48,437 --> 00:43:51,606
Every wizard who went bad was in
Slytherin.

419
00:43:51,607 --> 00:43:56,632
Susan Bones.

420
00:44:02,718 --> 00:44:05,020
Harry, what is it?

421
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:07,989
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

422
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,691
Let's see....

423
00:44:09,692 --> 00:44:15,797
I know! Hufflepuff!

424
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:20,732
Ronald Weasley.

425
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:37,786
Another Weasley! I know just what to
do with you.

426
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:42,585
Gryffindor!

427
00:44:46,295 --> 00:44:51,263
Harry Potter.

428
00:45:06,816 --> 00:45:10,018
Difficult, very difficult.

429
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:14,222
Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad
mind, either.

430
00:45:14,223 --> 00:45:16,725
There's talent, oh, yes.

431
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:20,762
And a thirst to prove yourself.

432
00:45:20,763 --> 00:45:23,531
But where to put you?

433
00:45:23,532 --> 00:45:26,234
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

434
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:30,105
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

435
00:45:30,106 --> 00:45:35,210
You could be great, you know. It's all
here, in your head.

436
00:45:35,211 --> 00:45:38,182
And Slytherin will help you on the way

437
00:45:38,183 --> 00:45:40,849
to greatness, no doubt about that.

438
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:45,720
No? Well, if you're sure.

439
00:45:45,721 --> 00:45:47,689
Better be...

440
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:52,158
...Gryffindor!

441
00:46:15,184 --> 00:46:19,988
Your attention, please.

442
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:25,185
Let the feast begin.

443
00:46:39,642 --> 00:46:41,376
I'm half and half.

444
00:46:41,377 --> 00:46:44,813
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

445
00:46:44,814 --> 00:46:49,384
Bit of a nasty shock for him when he
found out.

446
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:53,488
Percy, who's that teacher talking to
Professor Quirrell?

447
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:56,825
Professor Snape, head of Slytherin
house.

448
00:46:56,826 --> 00:46:58,960
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

449
00:46:58,961 --> 00:47:02,897
But he fancies the Dark Arts. He's

450
00:47:02,898 --> 00:47:07,058
been after Quirrell's job for years.

451
00:47:09,071 --> 00:47:11,606
Hello! How are you?

452
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:17,508
Welcome to Gryffindor.

453
00:47:25,054 --> 00:47:30,045
It's the Bloody Baron!

454
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:35,230
Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice
summer?

455
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:39,414
Dismal. Once again, my request to join

456
00:47:39,415 --> 00:47:43,169
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

457
00:47:43,706 --> 00:47:46,841
I know you. You're Nearly Headless
Nick.

458
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:49,777
I prefer Sir Nicholas, if you don't
mind.

459
00:47:49,778 --> 00:47:53,581
"Nearly" headless? How can you be
nearly headless?

460
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:58,050
Like this.

461
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:09,664
Gryffindors, follow me, please. Keep
up. Thank you.

462
00:48:09,665 --> 00:48:14,202
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

463
00:48:14,203 --> 00:48:17,739
This is the most direct path to the
dormitories.

464
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:24,472
Keep an eye on the staircases. They
like to change.

465
00:48:31,086 --> 00:48:34,136
Keep up, please, and follow me.

466
00:48:34,137 --> 00:48:37,091
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

467
00:48:37,092 --> 00:48:39,961
That picture's moving.

468
00:48:39,962 --> 00:48:45,233
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

469
00:48:45,234 --> 00:48:47,769
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

470
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,761
Welcome to Hogwarts.

471
00:49:06,288 --> 00:49:08,323
Password?

472
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:13,691
Caput Draconis.

473
00:49:17,933 --> 00:49:25,302
Follow me, everyone. Keep up. Quickly,
come on.

474
00:49:25,507 --> 00:49:29,611
Gather around here.

475
00:49:29,612 --> 00:49:33,147
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

476
00:49:33,148 --> 00:49:35,352
Boys'dormitory is upstairs to the

477
00:49:35,353 --> 00:49:37,752
left. Girls, the same on your right.

478
00:49:37,753 --> 00:49:43,347
Your belongings have already been
brought up.

479
00:50:49,124 --> 00:50:50,925
Made it!

480
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:54,331
Can you imagine the look on old

481
00:50:54,332 --> 00:50:58,056
McGonagall's face if we were late?

482
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:03,771
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

483
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:06,277
It'd be better if I transfigured Mr.

484
00:51:06,278 --> 00:51:08,242
Potter and you into a watch.

485
00:51:08,243 --> 00:51:11,679
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

486
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,388
Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't

487
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:19,982
need one to find your seats.

488
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:28,579
There will be no foolish wand-waving

489
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:31,532
or silly incantations in this class.

490
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:35,369
As such, I don't expect many of you to
appreciate...

491
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:39,307
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

492
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:43,311
However, for those select few...

493
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:49,179
...who possess the predisposition...

494
00:51:50,285 --> 00:51:53,855
...I can teach you how to bewitch the
mind...

495
00:51:53,856 --> 00:51:56,958
...and ensnare the senses.

496
00:51:56,959 --> 00:51:59,694
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

497
00:51:59,695 --> 00:52:08,100
...brew glory and even put a stopper
in death.

498
00:52:09,938 --> 00:52:12,600
Then again, maybe some of you have

499
00:52:12,601 --> 00:52:16,177
come to Hogwarts in possession of
abilities...

500
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:19,881
...so formidable that you feel
confident enough...

501
00:52:19,882 --> 00:52:25,818
...to not pay attention.

502
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:33,661
Mr. Potter.

503
00:52:33,662 --> 00:52:39,667
Our new celebrity.

504
00:52:39,668 --> 00:52:43,762
What would I get if I added root of

505
00:52:43,763 --> 00:52:47,970
asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

506
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,345
You don't know? Let's try again.

507
00:52:51,346 --> 00:52:57,218
Where would you look if I asked you to
find a bezoar?

508
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:58,886
I don't know, sir.

509
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:05,289
What is the difference between
monkshood and wolfsbane?

510
00:53:05,294 --> 00:53:08,629
I don't know, sir.

511
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,666
Pity.

512
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:16,604
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

513
00:53:16,605 --> 00:53:21,609
...is it, Mr. Potter?

514
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:28,416
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum Turn
this water into rum

515
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,284
Eye of rabbit....

516
00:53:30,285 --> 00:53:33,187
What's Seamus trying to do to the
water?

517
00:53:33,188 --> 00:53:37,162
Turn it to rum. Actually managed a

518
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:40,455
weak tea yesterday, before--

519
00:53:44,633 --> 00:53:49,067
Mail's here.

520
00:54:18,867 --> 00:54:24,302
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

521
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:28,175
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

522
00:54:28,176 --> 00:54:31,154
I've read about those. The smoke turns

523
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:33,981
red when you've forgotten something.

524
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:37,652
The problem is, I can't remember what
I've forgotten.

525
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:41,255
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

526
00:54:41,256 --> 00:54:45,159
"Believed to be the work of Dark
wizards or witches...

527
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,146
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge the

528
00:54:48,147 --> 00:54:51,133
breach but insist nothing was taken.

529
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:54,180
The vault in question, number 713, had

530
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:57,071
been emptied earlier that same day."

531
00:54:57,072 --> 00:55:03,804
That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid
and I went to.

532
00:55:10,218 --> 00:55:14,188
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

533
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:18,292
Good afternoon, Amanda. Good
afternoon.

534
00:55:18,293 --> 00:55:20,962
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

535
00:55:20,963 --> 00:55:25,099
What are you waiting for? Step up to
your broomstick.

536
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:28,381
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand

537
00:55:28,382 --> 00:55:30,905
over the broom and say, "Up."

538
00:55:30,906 --> 00:55:33,040
Up!

539
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:35,543
Up.

540
00:55:35,544 --> 00:55:39,080
Up.

541
00:55:39,081 --> 00:55:40,881
Up. Up!

542
00:55:40,882 --> 00:55:45,373
With feeling.

543
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,894
Shut up, Harry.

544
00:55:53,895 --> 00:55:56,460
Now, once you've got hold of your

545
00:55:56,461 --> 00:55:58,799
broom, I want you to mount it.

546
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,170
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

547
00:56:03,171 --> 00:56:05,978
When I blow my whistle, I want you to

548
00:56:05,979 --> 00:56:08,342
kick off from the ground, hard.

549
00:56:08,343 --> 00:56:12,380
Keep your broom steady, hover for a
moment...

550
00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:16,884
...then lean forward slightly and
touch back down.

551
00:56:16,885 --> 00:56:22,490
On my whistle. Three, two....

552
00:56:22,491 --> 00:56:26,356
Mr. Longbottom.

553
00:56:28,463 --> 00:56:31,565
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

554
00:56:31,566 --> 00:56:35,294
Neville!

555
00:56:36,538 --> 00:56:41,700
Come back down this instant!

556
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:13,070
Everyone out of the way!

557
00:57:16,111 --> 00:57:18,612
Is he all right?

558
00:57:18,613 --> 00:57:22,434
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist. Poor

559
00:57:22,435 --> 00:57:25,619
boy. Come on now, up you get.

560
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:28,270
Keep your feet on the ground while I

561
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:30,491
take him to the hospital wing.

562
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:34,361
Understand? If I see a single broom in
the air...

563
00:57:34,362 --> 00:57:37,375
...the one riding it will be expelled

564
00:57:37,376 --> 00:57:39,834
before they can say Quidditch.

565
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:41,969
Did you see his face?

566
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,096
If he had squeezed this, he'd have

567
00:57:44,097 --> 00:57:46,040
remembered to fall on his arse.

568
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:49,376
Give it here, Malfoy.

569
00:57:49,377 --> 00:57:55,574
No. I'll leave it somewhere for
Longbottom to find.

570
00:57:57,219 --> 00:58:00,888
How about on the roof?

571
00:58:00,889 --> 00:58:07,223
What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond
your reach?

572
00:58:07,229 --> 00:58:11,265
Harry, no way! You heard what Madam
Hooch said.

573
00:58:11,266 --> 00:58:14,468
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

574
00:58:14,469 --> 00:58:18,903
What an idiot.

575
00:58:19,741 --> 00:58:23,444
Give it here or I'll knock you off
your broom!

576
00:58:23,445 --> 00:58:28,038
Is that so?

577
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:33,515
Have it your way, then.

578
00:59:03,718 --> 00:59:07,588
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

579
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:10,591
Harry Potter!

580
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:15,117
Follow me.

581
00:59:24,272 --> 00:59:28,309
You wait here.

582
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,612
Professor Quirrell, excuse me. Could I

583
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:33,814
borrow Wood for a moment?

584
00:59:33,815 --> 00:59:38,146
Yes, of course.

585
00:59:41,256 --> 00:59:49,163
Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I
have found you a Seeker.

586
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:52,866
Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new
Gryffindor Seeker.

587
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:55,569
I always knew he'd do well.

588
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:59,807
Seeker? But first years never make the
house teams.

589
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:02,485
- You must be the youngest player in--

590
01:00:02,486 --> 01:00:04,545
- A century, McGonagall says.

591
01:00:04,546 --> 01:00:07,348
Well done, Harry. Wood's just told us.

592
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:10,084
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

593
01:00:10,085 --> 01:00:13,988
Our job is to make sure you don't get
bloodied up too bad.

594
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:16,857
Can't make any promises. Rough game,
Quidditch.

595
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:21,028
But no one's died in years. Someone
vanishes occasionally.

596
01:00:21,029 --> 01:00:23,998
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

597
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:27,033
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game

598
01:00:27,034 --> 01:00:29,904
there is, and you'll be great too.

599
01:00:29,904 --> 01:00:33,474
I've never played. What if I make a
fool of myself?

600
01:00:33,475 --> 01:00:40,810
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

601
01:00:46,888 --> 01:00:51,525
You never told me your father was a
Seeker too.

602
01:00:51,526 --> 01:00:56,187
I didn't know.

603
01:00:58,266 --> 01:01:00,634
I'm telling you, it's spooky. She

604
01:01:00,635 --> 01:01:03,003
knows more about you than you do.

605
01:01:03,004 --> 01:01:06,273
Who doesn't?

606
01:01:06,274 --> 01:01:08,609
What's happening?

607
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:15,308
The staircases change, remember?

608
01:01:18,253 --> 01:01:25,213
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

609
01:01:30,365 --> 01:01:34,001
Does anybody feel like we shouldn't be
here?

610
01:01:34,002 --> 01:01:36,337
We're not supposed to be here.

611
01:01:36,338 --> 01:01:41,475
This is the third floor. It's
forbidden.

612
01:01:41,476 --> 01:01:45,245
Let's go.

613
01:01:45,246 --> 01:01:50,647
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

614
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:57,856
Quick, let's hide through that door!

615
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:02,629
- It's locked!
- We're done for!

616
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:05,766
Move over!

617
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:08,802
Alohomora.

618
01:02:08,803 --> 01:02:11,939
Get in.

619
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,240
Alohomora?

620
01:02:13,241 --> 01:02:15,976
Standard Book of Spells, chapter
seven.

621
01:02:15,977 --> 01:02:21,878
Anyone here, my sweet?

622
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,521
Come on.

623
01:02:27,522 --> 01:02:30,190
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

624
01:02:30,191 --> 01:02:36,320
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

625
01:02:59,487 --> 01:03:02,519
What are they doing, keeping a thing

626
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,225
like that locked up in a school?

627
01:03:05,226 --> 01:03:09,062
Didn't you see what it was standing
on?

628
01:03:09,063 --> 01:03:11,540
I wasn't looking at its feet! I was

629
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:13,467
preoccupied with its heads.

630
01:03:13,468 --> 01:03:16,537
Or maybe you didn't notice. There were
three!

631
01:03:16,538 --> 01:03:20,407
It was standing on a trap door. It
wasn't there by accident.

632
01:03:20,408 --> 01:03:24,344
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

633
01:03:24,345 --> 01:03:28,382
That's right. Now, if you two don't
mind, I'm going to bed...

634
01:03:28,383 --> 01:03:32,186
...before you come up with another
idea to get us killed.

635
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:37,815
Or worse, expelled.

636
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:45,325
She needs to sort out her priorities.

637
01:03:47,435 --> 01:03:51,839
Quidditch is easy to understand. Each
team has seven players.

638
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,800
Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper

639
01:03:56,801 --> 01:04:00,108
and a Seeker. That's you.

640
01:04:02,684 --> 01:04:05,230
There are three kinds of balls. This

641
01:04:05,231 --> 01:04:07,020
one's called the Quaffle.

642
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:10,147
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try

643
01:04:10,148 --> 01:04:13,193
to put it through one of those hoops.

644
01:04:13,194 --> 01:04:17,764
The Keeper, that's me, defends the
hoops. With me so far?

645
01:04:17,765 --> 01:04:24,538
I think so. What are those?

646
01:04:24,539 --> 01:04:29,200
You better take this.

647
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:42,015
Careful now, it's coming back.

648
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:52,255
Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair
Beater.

649
01:05:06,414 --> 01:05:09,483
What was that?

650
01:05:09,484 --> 01:05:13,420
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

651
01:05:13,421 --> 01:05:19,413
But you are a Seeker.

652
01:05:20,495 --> 01:05:25,299
The only thing I want you to worry
about is this.

653
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,068
The Golden Snitch.

654
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:31,271
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

655
01:05:31,272 --> 01:05:35,509
Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn
near impossible to see.

656
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,644
What do I do with it?

657
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:41,114
You catch it. Before the other team's
Seeker.

658
01:05:41,115 --> 01:05:43,817
You catch this, the game's over.

659
01:05:43,818 --> 01:05:50,277
You catch this, Potter, and we win.

660
01:05:56,864 --> 01:06:02,402
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

661
01:06:02,403 --> 01:06:06,573
...or the ability to make objects fly.

662
01:06:06,574 --> 01:06:09,176
Do you have your feathers? Good.

663
01:06:09,177 --> 01:06:11,886
Now, don't forget the nice wrist

664
01:06:11,887 --> 01:06:14,514
movement we've been practicing.

665
01:06:14,515 --> 01:06:18,452
The swish and flick. Everyone.

666
01:06:18,453 --> 01:06:24,758
The swish and flick. Good. Oh, and
enunciate.

667
01:06:24,759 --> 01:06:30,130
Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go, then.

668
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:32,866
Wingardium Leviosa.

669
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:37,665
Wingardium Leviosa.

670
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:43,510
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going to
take someone's eye out.

671
01:06:43,511 --> 01:06:50,050
Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's
Leviosa, not Leviosar.

672
01:06:50,051 --> 01:06:55,589
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

673
01:06:55,590 --> 01:07:01,150
Wingardium Leviosa.

674
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:11,972
Well done! See here, everyone, Miss
Granger's done it!

675
01:07:11,973 --> 01:07:15,242
Splendid!

676
01:07:15,243 --> 01:07:19,904
Well done, dear.

677
01:07:21,683 --> 01:07:28,244
I think we're going to need another
feather over here.

678
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:36,730
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

679
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:40,265
She's a nightmare, honestly! No wonder

680
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:42,803
she hasn't got any friends.

681
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:47,772
I think she heard you.

682
01:08:13,968 --> 01:08:16,269
Where's Hermione?

683
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:19,606
Parvati said she wouldn't come out of
the bathroom.

684
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:26,168
She said that she'd been in there all
afternoon, crying.

685
01:08:28,082 --> 01:08:31,985
Troll in the dungeon!

686
01:08:31,986 --> 01:08:37,819
Troll in the dungeon!

687
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:42,957
Thought you ought to know.

688
01:08:47,401 --> 01:08:51,772
Silence!

689
01:08:51,773 --> 01:08:56,543
Everyone will please not panic!

690
01:08:56,544 --> 01:08:58,311
Now...

691
01:08:58,312 --> 01:09:03,517
...prefects will lead their house back
to the dormitories.

692
01:09:03,518 --> 01:09:10,887
Teachers will follow me to the
dungeons.

693
01:09:19,433 --> 01:09:22,803
Gryffindors, keep up, please, and stay
alert.

694
01:09:22,804 --> 01:09:24,771
How could a troll get in?

695
01:09:24,772 --> 01:09:27,273
Not on its own. Trolls are really

696
01:09:27,274 --> 01:09:30,143
stupid. Probably people playing jokes.

697
01:09:30,144 --> 01:09:36,637
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

698
01:09:46,194 --> 01:09:51,959
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

699
01:09:53,334 --> 01:09:57,995
It's going into the girls'bathroom.

700
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:31,399
Hermione, move!
