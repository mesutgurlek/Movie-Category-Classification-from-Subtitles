You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,974
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

98
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:59,479
You keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement,

99
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,315
like T-Rex and he'll lose
you if you don't move.

But no, not Velociraptor.

101
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:08,946
You stare at him and he
just stares right back.

102
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,115
And that's when
the attack comes.

Not from the front,
but from the side.

From the other two Raptors you
didn't even know were there.

Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter.

106
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,921
He uses coordinated
attack patterns

107

and he is out
in force today.

108

with this,

00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,515
a 6-inch retractable claw, like
a razor, on the middle toe.

your jugular like a lion. No.

Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

115
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:56,577
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

Both of you.

00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,372
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.

317
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,207
Your blood.

318
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,542
Right.

319
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,378

It's all part of the miracle of cloning.

321

ALAN: Cloned from what?

323
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,098

an intact DNA strand.

324
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,267
Not without massive
sequence gaps.

325
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,269
Paleo-DNA,
from what source?

326
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,398
Where do you get 100
million-year-old dinosaur blood?

327
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,277
(LIGHT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

328
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,404
What? What?

329
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,116
Well, Mr. DNA,
where did you come from?

330
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,576
From your blood.

331
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:58,955
Just one drop of your blood contains
billions of strands of DNA,

332
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,583
the building blocks of life.

333
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:06,963
A DNA strand like me is a blueprint
for building a living thing.

334
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,302
And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs,

335
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:17,641
left their blueprints behind for us to find.
We just had to know where to look.

336
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:22,646
A hundred million years ago, there
were mosquitoes just like today.

337
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:26,108
And just like today, they fed
on the blood of animals.

338
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,946
Even dinosaurs. Sometimes,
after biting a dinosaur,

339
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,784
mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.

340
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:40,997
After a long time, the tree sap would
get hard and become fossilized,

341
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:46,002
just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.

342
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:50,298
This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber,

343
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:54,886
waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside

344
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,056
until Jurassic Park
scientists came along.

345
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,101
Using sophisticated
techniques,

346
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,270
they extract
the preserved blood

347
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:07,691
from the mosquito,
and bingo: dino DNA!

348
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:13,029
A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.

349
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:17,743
If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day,

350
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:21,997
it'd take two years to look
at the entire DNA strand.

351
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,752
It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.

352
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:30,046
Now that's where our
geneticists take over.

353
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,217
Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers

354
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,470
break down the strand
in minutes.

355
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,597
And virtual-reality displays

356
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,850
show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.

357
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,936
We used the complete
DNA of a frog

358
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:48,940
to fill in the holes
and complete the code.

359
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,695
Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.

How do you know
they can't breed?

Yes.

they're all female?

We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

421
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,997
All vertebrate embryos are
inherently female, anyway.

422
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:35,750
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage

weaknesses, systematically.

Yes. Well, who's hungry?

475

adventurous guests, of course,

ready yet, but the park will open

479
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,147
with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line

JOHN: Donald.

487
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:42,747
This park was not built to
cater only for the super rich.

488
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,833
Everyone in the world has the
right to enjoy these animals.

489
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,505
Sure. They will.
We'll have a coupon day or something.

490
00:34:55,427 --> 00:35:00,306
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

491
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,769
Thank you. But things are a little
different than you and I had feared.

492
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,271
I know.
They're a lot worse.

493
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:09,607
Now, wait a second, we haven't
even seen the park yet...

494
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:14,612
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.

495
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:19,951
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

496
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,620
Genetic power's the most awesome
force the planet's ever seen

497
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:25,540
but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

498
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,792
It's hardly appropriate
to start hurling...

499
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,168
If I may.

500
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,964
I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power you're using here.

501
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,050
It didn't require
any discipline to attain it.

502
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:40,680
You read what others had done,
and you took the next step.

503
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,099
You didn't earn the
knowledge for yourselves

504
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:46,227
so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

505
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:49,480
You stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish

506
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:50,732
something as fast
as you could.

507
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:55,153
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it

508
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:58,323
and slapped it on a plastic lunch
box, now you're selling it.

509
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,158
You're going to sell it.

510
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:02,910
I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.

511
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:06,414
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

512
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,751
But your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could,

513
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,086
they didn't stop to
think if they should.

514
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:16,090
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

515
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,053
If I was to create a flock of
condors on this island,

516
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,679
you wouldn't have
anything to say.

517
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:24,515
Hold on, this isn't some
species that was obliterated

518
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,769
by deforestation or
the building of a dam.

519
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:32,732
Dinosaurs had their shot and nature
selected them for extinction.

520
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:38,946
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

521
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:43,951
How can we stand in the light
of discovery and not act?

522
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:45,495
What's so great
about discovery?

523
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,705
It's a violent,
penetrative act,

524
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,417
that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,

525
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:55,213
I call the rape of
the natural world.

526
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,884
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

527
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,137
And therefore, how could you ever
assume that you can control it?

528
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,224
You have poisonous plants
in this building.

529
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,767
You picked them
because they look good.

530
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,938
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in

531
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:15,191
and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

532
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:20,405
Dr. Grant, if there's
one person here

533
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:22,365
who could appreciate
what I am trying to do...

534
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:29,038
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

535
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,335
I don't want to jump to any
conclusions, but dinosaurs and man,

536
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:38,589
two species separated by 65
million years of evolution

537
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:42,135
have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together.

538
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:46,639
How can we possibly have the
slightest idea what to expect?

539
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,934
I don't believe it.

540
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,312
You're meant to come here and
defend me against these characters

541
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:57,066
and the only one I've got on my
side is the blood-sucking lawyer.

542
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:58,860

That's great.

568
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:27,448
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

569
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,285
A few species may have
evolved along those lines.

570
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,126
Because they sure don't
look like birds to me.

was this meteor,

572

hit the earth someplace down in
Mexico, and made this big crater.

Then I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.

578
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,780
It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.

of the weather.
