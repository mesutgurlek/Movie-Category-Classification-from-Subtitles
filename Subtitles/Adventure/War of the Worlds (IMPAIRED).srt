1
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:28,455
<i>No one would have believed
in the early years of the 21st century</i>

2
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:35,970
<i>that our world was being watched
by intelligences greater than our own...</i>

3
00:01:38,867 --> 00:01:42,903
<i>That as men busied themselves
about their various concerns...</i>

4
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,950
<i>they observed and studied...</i>

5
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,818
<i>the way a man with the microscope
might scrutinize</i>

6
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:57,595
<i>the creatures that swarm and multiply
in a drop of water.</i>

7
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:00,978
<i>With infinite complacency,</i>

8
00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:03,807
<i>men went to and fro about the globe.</i>

9
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:09,320
<i>Confident of our empire over this world.</i>

10
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,495
<i>Yet, across the gulf of space,</i>

11
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:19,463
<i>intellects vast and cool
and unsympathetic</i>

12
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:23,536
<i>regarded our planet with envious eyes,</i>

13
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,841
<i>and slowly and surely</i>

14
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:32,215
<i>drew their plans against us.</i>

15
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:44,957
Ray!

16
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:51,750
I need you back at 4 instead of 12.
I've got half the Korea coming.

17
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,202
No, I can't.
I'm on a 12 hour blow.

18
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:55,375
Call Fedesco.

19
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,311
Fedesco can't move 40 containers
in one hour.

20
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,768
I gotta have somebody
who can do double fix.

21
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:04,462
Sorry, I can't help you, Sal.
The goddamn union regulates.

22
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,294
Com'on, I'm in a position here.

23
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,943
Remember the union regulation, Sal.

24
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:12,089
You know what your problem is?

25
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:14,998
I can think of a couple of women
who'd be happy to tell you.

26
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:40,422
8:30?

27
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,663
We said 8:00.

28
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:50,544
This is one safe looking new vehicle
you've got yourself, Tim.

29
00:04:50,544 --> 00:04:52,239
Congratulations.
Thank you!

30
00:04:55,453 --> 00:04:57,248
8:00, huh?

31
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:01,371
We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,
depending on the traffic.

32
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,592
Here he is.

33
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:09,646
Get a hug?

34
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,748
Handshake?

35
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:14,214
Kicking the teeth?

36
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:16,771
The door is locked.

37
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,827
Still got those manners?

38
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:22,100
Hello, dad.

39
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:24,806
Hello, Rachel!

40
00:05:37,994 --> 00:05:40,911
Here, honey.
Let me give you a hand.

41
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:42,112
The door is locked.

42
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:43,909
Sweetheart, let me get it.

43
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:46,814
- Hey, she said she can get it.
- I've got it.

44
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,096
- It's heavy.
- It has got rollers.

45
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:51,845
- Just roll it.
- We can't roll it up the stairs.

46
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,239
I've got it from here, OK?

47
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,826
302 V8, it's er...

48
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:05,302
it's gonna be out here next week.

49
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,405
You'd better get go and you won't be
in the traffic, don't you think?

50
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:14,282
You're out of milk.

51
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:16,450
And everything else.

52
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,721
You close the door, please?
Cause it's my refrigerator.

53
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,263
I'm gonna... wait outside.

54
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:30,184
You're OK, sweetheart.
See you in a few days.

55
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:31,489
Bye, Tim.

56
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:35,626
- I'd better get this upstairs.
- Let me... let me get...

57
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:56,439
A little old to still be sharing,
aren't they?

58
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:59,957
- I don't hear any complaint.
- No, I do.

59
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:08,336
Robbie has got a paper
on the French occupation of Algeria...

60
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,636
which is yet to begin.

61
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:13,666
It would be nice if you were done
by the time we got back

62
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,780
so we don't have to keep him up
all night on Sunday.

63
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,398
I've just got to type it up.

64
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:21,204
- No, you just gotta start writing it first.
- I love you, mum.

65
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:23,397
I love you.

66
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:27,226
Listen to your father.

67
00:07:27,226 --> 00:07:29,933
Oh, no shoes on bed.

68
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:34,087
We'll be at my parents' house in Boston

69
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,798
but don't call the house line.

70
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:39,309
The point is I've got my cellphone
so if anything comes up

71
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,080
or you have any questions,
just call me.

72
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,513
Believe it or not, I can handle it.

73
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:43,953
I'll leave the phone on.

74
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:44,940
Mary Ann...

75
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:48,038
this is good look for you.

76
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,113
You think?

77
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:55,291
Yeah.

78
00:07:57,557 --> 00:07:58,848
Take care of our kids.

79
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,850
You've got nothing to worry about.

80
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:05,898
Listen, you tell your mom
that... Rays sends love and kisses.

81
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:10,910
She'll love that.

82
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:22,652
<i>The Ukraine,
a country of 52 million people,</i>

83
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:24,482
<i>is in almost blackness tonight</i>

84
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:26,998
<i>in the wake of a series
of freakish lightning storms</i>

85
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:31,928
<i>of catastrophic proportion which struck
the country at approximately 4 a.m.</i>

86
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:36,585
<i>EMP: eletroc-magnetic pulse,</i>

87
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:40,969
<i>which causes a temporary interruption
of all electrical current within its field.</i>

88
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:44,474
<i>As in the Ukraine, there are
scattered reports that EMP here</i>

89
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:48,461
<i>was followed by sismic activity
on the scale of an earthquake,</i>

90
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,783
<i>measuring 6.5 on the Richter Scale.
This...</i>

91
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:58,655
- Baseball season is over.
- 5 minutes. That's not gonna kill you.

92
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:02,614
Here he is.

93
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:08,630
Boston.

94
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,408
There it is?

95
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:15,677
That's how it could be?

96
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:21,667
- Careful with that throw.
- Whatever, Ray.

97
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:25,917
Mum says you got a report due on Monday.
You're gonna work on that when we're done here.

98
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:28,458
Yeah, I'm almost finished.
I've just got to type it up.

99
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,977
That's bullshit.

100
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:32,431
Yeah?

101
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:34,570
What do you know, Ray?

102
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,976
Everything. Haven't you heard
between me and my brother?

103
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:38,781
We know everything.

104
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,291
What's the capital of Australia?

105
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,310
That's one my brother's knows.

106
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,509
OK with you I just laughed the first
of 500 times you tell that one?

107
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:55,530
Just do your report...

108
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,091
We don't send you to school
so you could flunk out.

109
00:09:58,091 --> 00:10:00,101
You don't pay for it.
Tim does.

110
00:10:06,768 --> 00:10:08,055
That's half what I got.

111
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:10,463
You're an asshole.

112
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:11,858
I hate coming here.

113
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:14,067
Why you act like such a dick?

114
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:30,723
What?

115
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:34,017
That's not how you gonna get
through to him.

116
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:36,782
- If you want him to listen to you...
- What are you?

117
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:38,474
A mother?
Not mine.

118
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,744
Where are you going?

119
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:42,961
Go to sleep.

120
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:44,564
I work for a living.

121
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:49,546
- What are we supposed to eat?
- You know... order.

122
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:39,910
What's the matter?

123
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,573
I've got a splinter.

124
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:46,115
Where did you get it?
Come here.

125
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,436
On the porch railing.

126
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:52,104
You need me there. You did what?

127
00:11:54,151 --> 00:11:56,717
- You want me to take that out?
- Certainly not.

128
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,300
Come here, let me see that.

129
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:01,921
Dad!

130
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,649
Just look.
Don't touch it!

131
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,207
I can't, you're moving around.

132
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:07,291
OK, but don't touch it.
Just look at it.

133
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:10,405
It's gonna get infected.

134
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:12,754
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it's gonna be infected.

135
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:13,735
No, it won't.

136
00:12:14,218 --> 00:12:17,779
When it's ready,
my body will just push it out.

137
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:21,392
- Push it out?
- Yeah, like that.

138
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:26,213
You should get TiVo.

139
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,735
Tim got it for my room.
It's awesome.

140
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:33,796
To watch all my shows after homework.

141
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:38,647
I'll just put on my platinum card.

142
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:39,772
Robbie!

143
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:48,086
What is that?

144
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,041
Hummus.

145
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:51,858
Hummus?

146
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:52,997
From the health food place.

147
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:56,392
I kept one of their menus
last time we were here.

148
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:01,224
You said to order!

149
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:04,645
I meant order food.

150
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:06,917
Where is Robbie?

151
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:09,271
- He went out.
- Out where?

152
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:13,203
I don't know.
He just took your car and left.

153
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,433
You ever see something like that?

154
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:58,523
Springtime maybe,
not this time here.

155
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:01,303
Com'on.
We'll see better from the backyard.

156
00:14:37,004 --> 00:14:39,264
- That is so weird.
- What?

157
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:42,602
The wind is blowing towards the storm.

158
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:44,044
That is weird.

159
00:14:48,884 --> 00:14:50,915
Rachel, wanna see some cool?

160
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:26,426
It's OK.

161
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:28,363
I wanna go inside.
It's OK!

162
00:15:28,363 --> 00:15:30,205
I wanna go inside!

163
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:32,904
OK, you go ahead.

164
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,266
That's enough lightnings for me.

165
00:15:38,076 --> 00:15:39,733
I won't go by myself.

166
00:15:44,936 --> 00:15:47,331
It's kinda fun, innit?
No.

167
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,598
Com'on, like the 4th of July.

168
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:51,194
No, it's not.

169
00:16:03,476 --> 00:16:05,494
It's OK. You're fine.

170
00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:09,196
-  It hit right behind our house.
- It's not gonna hit here again.

171
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:12,522
Because lightning doesn't strike twice
in the same place...

172
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:14,345
Shit!

173
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:20,685
Where is Robbie?

174
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:23,907
I don't know.

175
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:26,725
Is Robbie OK?

176
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:30,910
Are you OK?

177
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:32,906
Where is the thunder?

178
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:35,370
I want it stop.

179
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:51,251
Is it over?

180
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:08,256
Where you going?

181
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,225
Just checking things out.
Wait there.

182
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:13,917
Are we gonna be OK?

183
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,300
I don't know.

184
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,946
- You don't know?
- No... just... Rachel, please.

185
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:22,423
Stop asking so many questions.
Just wait here.

186
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:12,909
You believe this, Ray?
Every single car.

187
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:17,323
Jesus, Jesus.

188
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:19,603
- The car just stopped and...
- You're OK?

189
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:22,889
- Lightnings hit our walkway over and over.
- Are you OK? You are right?

190
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:25,646
- Where the hell did you go?
- Over Lincoln Avenue.

191
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:30,850
- You saw the lightning?
- Yes! 26 times, we counted.

192
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:34,392
The lightning started to hit and open up
like a hole or something.

193
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:35,513
26 times? OK.

194
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,180
- You're OK?
- Yeah.

195
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,295
Your sister is in the house.
I want you to go there and stay with her.

196
00:18:44,513 --> 00:18:48,303
And next time you take my car
with no driver's license and no permission,

197
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:49,863
I call the cops.

198
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:53,825
You'd better be there when I get back!

199
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:04,315
Manny!

200
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:07,605
- What is it? Dead?
- Oil and everything. Look at this!

201
00:19:08,374 --> 00:19:10,731
- Starter's fried.
- Lightning hit it?

202
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:14,681
Not even close. I thought if I changed it...
You've got any idea of what's going on?

203
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:17,472
I'm on my way to find out.
Try to change the solenoid.

204
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:20,822
Right... I told you that.
The solenoid.

205
00:19:40,158 --> 00:19:41,716
- Let us through.
- Hey.

206
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,734
I'm sure you know who is bedhind this.

207
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:49,366
God's pissed off
at the neighborhood right now...

208
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,163
- You see it?
- Yes.

209
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:52,741
- You've got power?
- No.

210
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:56,656
- It's the cars though, you know.
- A solar flare, a guy told me.

211
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:57,872
Solar flare?

212
00:19:57,872 --> 00:20:01,679
Yeah, he says the sun resorts big blast
of plasma and turns in a solar flare.

213
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,511
Can I say something...

214
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:04,396
It's the only thing
that can kill all the electronic stuff...

215
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:06,969
Can I say something?
The sun doesn't cause lightning, OK?

216
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:09,993
- I told you what the guy said he heard.
- OK, but it just sounds dumb.

217
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:19,392
I've never seen
anything like this before.

218
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:21,051
That many lightnings on one spot.

219
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,884
- Is this the only place?
- Put that down.

220
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:26,921
We're gonna fall in.

221
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:46,240
Is it hot?

222
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:49,864
No, it's freezing.

223
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,052
- You feel that?
- You feel that?

224
00:20:58,202 --> 00:20:59,722
- Yeah.
- What is it? The subway?

225
00:20:59,722 --> 00:21:01,041
There is no subway here.

226
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:01,934
A train maybe?

227
00:21:01,934 --> 00:21:03,434
That can't be the water main.

228
00:21:03,434 --> 00:21:04,905
There's nothing that stand there.

229
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:06,621
The water main doesn't run through here.

230
00:21:06,621 --> 00:21:08,796
Well, there's something down there
and it's moving.

231
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,456
Step back!

232
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:44,129
Everyone back up,
everyone clear the intersection.

233
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:20,974
What's that?

234
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:25,167
Oh my God!

235
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:28,987
Ray, no, stay in back.

236
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:17,052
What happened?

237
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,092
What's going on?

238
00:28:22,378 --> 00:28:23,733
Dad, what's the matter?

239
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:27,197
What's all that stuff all over you?

240
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:33,697
What's all that stuff?

241
00:29:10,607 --> 00:29:12,682
We live this house in 60 seconds.

242
00:29:13,488 --> 00:29:17,393
- Why? I've no idea of what's going on.
- The food from the fridge, put it in here.

243
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:19,710
Just do it.

244
00:29:21,283 --> 00:29:23,820
- Rachel!
- Dad, you're really scaring.

245
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,095
I need you to get a suitcase.
You bring it to me.

246
00:29:28,883 --> 00:29:30,366
Can you just do that for me?

247
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,884
What's happening?

248
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:56,530
I can't tell you now.
We've only got about... another minute.

249
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,175
Please...

250
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:13,782
Keep down.

251
00:30:13,782 --> 00:30:16,389
Ray, I'm standing right beside you,
can you please answer me?

252
00:30:19,082 --> 00:30:20,413
Get the front seat, Robbie.

253
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,217
Whose car is this?

254
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:28,762
Whose car is this!

255
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:37,012
Hey, you were absolutely right,
I had to change the solenoid.

256
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:48,191
Com'on, open up.

257
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:49,637
Open the door!

258
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,971
- Get in, Manny.
- That's funny. You gotta get out of the car.

259
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:58,924
- It's not yours.
- Manny, Manny, shut up!

260
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:01,303
Get in, Manny.
The guy is gonna come back.

261
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:04,023
- I don't have time to explain.
- I've got a shop to run.

262
00:31:06,173 --> 00:31:07,803
Get in, Manny, and you're gonna die.

263
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:09,823
What do you mean?

264
00:31:12,214 --> 00:31:14,230
Get out of the truck.
I'm not kiddin you. Get out!

265
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:23,202
- I'm not fooling around. I got a busy day...
- Close the door!

266
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:33,817
Get down! Get down!

267
00:31:35,243 --> 00:31:36,773
Are they the terrorists?

268
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:38,832
- Get down!
- Holy shit!

269
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,754
- Where are we going?
- We gotta go.

270
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:17,786
We got maybe the only working car.
We're not stopping until we are clear.

271
00:32:17,786 --> 00:32:18,657
Clear what?

272
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:22,470
- What the hell is going on?
- You saw. We're under attack!

273
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,018
By who?
Who's attacking us?

274
00:32:26,732 --> 00:32:27,891
Can you keep her down?

275
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:29,838
Shut up!

276
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:33,312
I'm driving, do something!

277
00:32:33,932 --> 00:32:36,493
OK, put 'em up, Rach.
Make the arms.

278
00:32:36,493 --> 00:32:39,517
This space is yours, right?

279
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:42,876
- You're safe in your space.
- I'm safe in my space.

280
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:44,752
- Nothing will happen to you in this space.
- I'm scared!

281
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:47,543
I'm gonna go in the front seat.
I must talk to dad.

282
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:49,096
I'll be like 2 feet away, OK?

283
00:32:49,096 --> 00:32:50,879
- Will you hold my hand?
- Yes.

284
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:52,461
- You're gonna be OK?
- Yes.

285
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,493
I wanna know everything you know.

286
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:01,699
This thing, this machine,
it crawled out of the ground

287
00:33:01,699 --> 00:33:04,290
and started to torch on everything,
just killing everybody.

288
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:05,860
What is it?

289
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:07,382
Is it terrorists?

290
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:10,184
This came from some place else.

291
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:13,334
- Like Europe?
- No, Robbie, not like Europe!

292
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,293
Dad, this machine, it's already here.

293
00:33:28,014 --> 00:33:29,238
Buried.

294
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:30,928
Maybe...

295
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:35,126
it came down in the lightning storm.

296
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:39,994
What do you mean, "came down"?

297
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:41,537
You've just said it was buried.

298
00:33:41,537 --> 00:33:43,907
No, the machine I'm talking about
was buried but...

299
00:33:46,115 --> 00:32:37,950
what came down in the lightning storm...

300
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,296
what operates...
That's the...

301
00:33:51,982 --> 00:33:53,117
The what?

302
00:33:53,117 --> 00:33:54,944
1.30, helicopters or airplanes.

303
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:57,227
- That's the what?
- Hey, Rach.

304
00:33:57,227 --> 00:33:59,299
- How is she doing?
- How you doing?

305
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,230
- OK.
- She's good.

306
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:03,868
What was that thing you do with her?

307
00:34:03,868 --> 00:34:05,485
Sometimes, she gets claustrophobic.

308
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,223
- I want mum.
- You feel better?

309
00:34:10,095 --> 00:34:11,459
Don't tell me about it, you know.

310
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:15,350
What I need you to do is
to hold it together for me. OK?

311
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,658
I want mum!

312
00:34:16,658 --> 00:34:18,253
When you start screaming like that...

313
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:22,238
That's where we're going right now.

314
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:24,853
- I want mum!
- I know!

315
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:42,496
Where you've that one.

316
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:51,504
Robbie, the door.

317
00:34:54,228 --> 00:34:57,086
Mum! Mum!

318
00:34:57,537 --> 00:35:02,322
Mum! Tim!

319
00:35:23,195 --> 00:35:24,416
They're gone.

320
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,747
Is she dead?

321
00:35:26,964 --> 00:35:28,150
She is not dead.

322
00:35:28,682 --> 00:35:31,701
She is just not here, OK?
They were never here.

323
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:32,834
How do you know?

324
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:34,450
Because they're on the way to Boston.

325
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:38,884
I just hope they just...
kept on going up to Boston.

326
00:35:38,884 --> 00:35:40,659
They must be up
at your grandma's house by now.

327
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:41,626
I'm gonna call her.

328
00:35:41,626 --> 00:35:43,722
How come the lights are on here
and not at your place?

329
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:47,390
Because there's nothing bad up there.

330
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,801
We're safe here.

331
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:53,420
Rachel, this is your area.
You are safe...

332
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,571
Dad, it's not how it goes.

333
00:35:55,507 --> 00:35:56,966
OK.
Well, you're hungry?

334
00:35:57,791 --> 00:35:59,699
Because there is food.
I'm gonna feed ya.

335
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:06,507
- We have this ketchup, mustard...
- Busy. You think all the circuits are down?

336
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:10,013
This is really good, Robbie!

337
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:12,270
I said pack food.
What the hell is this?

338
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,015
That's all there was in your kitchen.

339
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,355
That's all right.

340
00:36:21,727 --> 00:36:24,726
Food.

341
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:25,587
Er, bread.

342
00:36:26,596 --> 00:36:28,516
OK. We're gonna have, er,

343
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:31,768
let's get some sandwiches.

344
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:36,262
See me deal.

345
00:36:38,953 --> 00:36:42,003
2 for you, 2 for Robbie,

346
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:42,978
2 for me,

347
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:43,991
one for the house.

348
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:53,021
Maybe after you've eaten some,
I'll teach you how to play some poker,

349
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:55,757
5 card stud, maybe a little blackjack.

350
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:56,858
I'm allergic to peanut butter.

351
00:36:58,227 --> 00:36:59,502
Since when?

352
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,283
Birth.

353
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,561
You can eat two bread, OK?

354
00:37:09,198 --> 00:37:10,381
I'm not hungry.

355
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:15,869
Robbie and I could eat
peanut butter sandwhiches.

356
00:37:16,503 --> 00:37:17,792
With jelly on this sandwich?

357
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:19,004
I'm not hungry either.

358
00:37:19,594 --> 00:37:20,704
You're not hungry either?

359
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,318
Everybody just... relax, OK?

360
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:39,274
That's why we're here now.
We're safe. We're gonna stay.

361
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:44,565
And in the morning, mum and Tim
are gonna be here, and it will be fine.

362
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,137
If everything's fine,
why do we have to sleep in the basement?

363
00:37:55,137 --> 00:37:56,518
We've got perfectly good beds.

364
00:37:56,518 --> 00:37:58,309
It's like a slumber party.

365
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,158
What are you afraid
it's gonna happen to us?

366
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:01,335
Nice basement.

367
00:38:01,335 --> 00:38:03,006
I wanna sleep in my bed.

368
00:38:03,153 --> 00:38:04,836
I've got back problems.

369
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:10,428
You know the way the channel,
when there's a tornado,

370
00:38:10,731 --> 00:38:13,035
and they tell to go
in the basement for safety?

371
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:15,167
- It's like that.
- There's gonna be tornados?

372
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:20,078
- Rachel, no more talking.
- Can't you be nice to me?

373
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:31,836
- Good night, Robbie.
- I love you, Rach.

374
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:47,372
Is the lightning back?

375
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:51,411
No, this is something else.

376
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:13,721
- What's that sound?
- I've never heard that before!

377
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:15,609
What is that?

378
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:19,459
We gotta go! Where do we go?

379
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,334
Are we still alive?

380
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,862
Down here!

381
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:56,390
You were on this plane?

382
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,749
Are you a passenger?

383
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:09,422
How you doin?
Will help me open it?

384
00:43:12,387 --> 00:43:13,923
Are you a passenger?

385
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:15,700
He's deaf!

386
00:43:16,363 --> 00:43:18,160
The show went off right beside him.

387
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,006
The camera on his soulder saved his life.

388
00:43:20,006 --> 00:43:24,140
You get that, Max? Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life.

389
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:26,326
Where were you?

390
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:29,098
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

391
00:43:30,282 --> 00:43:33,718
We were attached to a national
guard unit, the 83rd mechanized.

392
00:43:33,718 --> 00:43:36,198
They moved on one of those things
around midnight.

393
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:38,322
They got some kind of shield
around them.

394
00:43:38,322 --> 00:43:41,232
We can't see if everything
we fire at them detonates too early

395
00:43:41,232 --> 00:43:43,561
before we can get close enough
to considerably damage.

396
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:47,856
When they flash the thing,
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

397
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:50,528
There's more than one?

398
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:53,894
You gotta be kidding me, right?

399
00:43:55,113 --> 00:43:57,677
We were feeding New York
when New York went dark.

400
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,869
Some patched over the DC,
they went down.

401
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:02,995
L.A., Chicago, uplink to London.

402
00:44:02,995 --> 00:44:05,871
Even called to try
to get them catch the feed

403
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:07,466
but nobody answers.

404
00:44:07,466 --> 00:44:09,104
It's the same everywhere.

405
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:12,759
Once the tripods start to move,
no more news comes ouf of the area.

406
00:44:23,946 --> 00:44:25,831
My God!

407
00:44:26,723 --> 00:44:28,389
You ain't seen nothing yet.

408
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:35,056
I saw that storm.
I was right in the middle of one of those.

409
00:44:35,056 --> 00:44:36,961
You didn't see like this.

410
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:39,712
Those machines come out
from under the ground, right?

411
00:44:39,712 --> 00:44:42,205
So that means they must been buried
a long time ago.

412
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,626
So who's driving the goddamn things?

413
00:44:44,626 --> 00:44:46,516
Watch the lightning.

414
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:48,262
Watch it.

415
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:52,900
Watch the lightning.
Keep watching it.

416
00:44:57,751 --> 00:44:59,222
What is that?

417
00:44:59,511 --> 00:45:00,742
That...

418
00:45:01,108 --> 00:45:02,376
is them.

419
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:06,581
They come down in capsules right in the
lightning into the ground into the machines.

420
00:45:09,921 --> 00:45:11,114
You hear that?

421
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,548
We get the hell ouf of here.

422
00:45:17,787 --> 00:45:19,770
Get in, get in!

423
00:45:21,603 --> 00:45:24,045
Were you on that plane?

424
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,787
That's too bad.

425
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:29,671
It would have been a great story.

426
00:45:31,235 --> 00:45:32,475
Look at me.

427
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,039
You keep your eyes only on me,
understand?

428
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:38,001
Don't look down, don't look around me.

429
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:41,514
I'm taking you to that car
and you're gonna wanna look around

430
00:45:42,163 --> 00:45:44,925
but you're not going to, OK?

431
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:46,838
You're doing good.

432
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,827
Keep your eyes on me.

433
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:51,908
We go right to Boston.
We gonna see your ma.

434
00:45:52,938 --> 00:45:54,093
Nice girl.

435
00:45:54,093 --> 00:45:56,667
Listen, I want you to close
your eyes, OK?

436
00:45:57,322 --> 00:45:59,504
Closed?
Here we go.

437
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:08,405
Robbie, get in!

438
00:46:10,496 --> 00:46:12,894
- Robbie, get in!
- Why are you yelling?

439
00:46:16,312 --> 00:46:17,351
Get in.

440
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:42,521
- Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
- I don't want anybody see our working car.

441
00:46:42,658 --> 00:46:44,553
We're still on the Hudson to me.

442
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:47,106
We'll find an open bridge
or a ferry that went across the Hudson,

443
00:46:47,106 --> 00:46:50,938
and take the backroads across
Connecticut all the way to Boston.

444
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:52,770
Where is everybody?

445
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,683
I don't know, running, hiding...

446
00:46:55,683 --> 00:46:58,792
With any balls, we find
one of those things and kill it.

447
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,868
Just let me make the big decisions, OK?

448
00:47:02,868 --> 00:47:07,232
- Which mean never, Ray?
- Hey, enough of the Ray shit!

449
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:11,532
- It's dad, sir or Mr Ferrier.
- Don't cry!

450
00:47:11,532 --> 00:47:14,144
That sounds a little weird to me
but you decide.

451
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:18,018
- Dad!
- Yes, Rachel?

452
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:22,198
I have to go to the bathroom.

453
00:47:23,828 --> 00:47:24,872
Really?

454
00:47:33,044 --> 00:47:34,245
Not to fast, Al'right?

455
00:47:34,245 --> 00:47:35,866
We got to watch out for.

456
00:47:36,533 --> 00:47:39,180
And second, people who might want our car.

457
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,300
- There's nobody around!
- I've got to go.

458
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:52,398
Rachel, it's good right there.

459
00:47:52,398 --> 00:47:54,457
Not in front of you, guys!

460
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:57,071
Just go where I can see you.

461
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:59,865
Are you crazy?
Don't look!

462
00:47:59,865 --> 00:48:02,415
I'm not gonna look.
Just stay in sight.

463
00:48:02,415 --> 00:48:03,956
That's looking!

464
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:07,664
Everytime you don't listen to me,

465
00:48:07,664 --> 00:48:10,994
I'm telling your mother.
I'll make a list.

466
00:48:12,758 --> 00:48:14,178
Make a list!

467
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,640
I told you to stay where I can see you!

468
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,207
Stop!

469
00:49:16,664 --> 00:49:20,876
Wait! Stop!
Let me on! Gimme a hand!

470
00:49:24,321 --> 00:49:26,999
Watch out, kid!
You gonna get yourself run over!

471
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,109
Robbie!
You wanna go in that direction?

472
00:49:32,408 --> 00:49:34,916
You're dead if you're leaving
in that direction Robbie!

473
00:49:35,116 --> 00:49:38,232
You never gave a shit before!

474
00:49:38,232 --> 00:49:39,368
You never give a shit!

475
00:49:39,368 --> 00:49:41,397
OK, smartass, what's your plan?

476
00:49:41,397 --> 00:49:44,105
You become dad,
you tell me where we're going.

477
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:48,141
We catch up these soldiers, hook up with
whoever isn't dead and get back at them!

478
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:50,050
We get back at them!

479
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,013
That's what we do!

480
00:49:52,013 --> 00:49:55,844
Try one that doesn't involve
your ten-year-old sister joining the army!

481
00:49:55,968 --> 00:49:57,584
You have anything like that?

482
00:49:57,584 --> 00:50:00,098
- Why not tell you've no idea where to go?
- Well, try something like that!

483
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:02,918
You wanna come up wise and shit?

484
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:06,305
You only chose Boston
because you hope mum's there,

485
00:50:06,305 --> 00:50:08,721
and so you can dump us on her.

486
00:50:08,721 --> 00:50:12,282
and then you only have to care
about yourself.

487
00:50:12,282 --> 00:50:15,093
That's exactly the way you like it!

488
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:20,011
Robbie, where you try to go?

489
00:50:20,011 --> 00:50:22,234
What are your trying to do?

490
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,419
Who's gonna take care of me if you go?

491
00:50:45,488 --> 00:50:47,819
<i>This is a test
of the emergency alarm system.</i>

492
00:50:48,434 --> 00:50:53,827
<i>If this had been an actual emergency,
official messages would follow</i>

493
00:50:53,827 --> 00:50:54,981
<i>the alert tone.</i>

494
00:50:55,478 --> 00:50:58,435
<i>This concludes the test
of the emergency alert.</i>

495
00:51:00,028 --> 00:51:02,239
I'll close my eyes,
why don't you drive for a bit?

496
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:05,288
I don't have a license.

497
00:51:06,849 --> 00:51:08,668
Since when does that stop you?

498
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,101
Ray!

499
00:51:44,819 --> 00:51:46,085
Dad!

500
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:57,726
Don't stop.
Don't keep your foot off!

501
00:51:57,726 --> 00:52:00,015
I've got it.
Keep you're foot.

502
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,150
I've got it.

503
00:52:01,664 --> 00:52:04,404
- Where is everybody going?
- I don't know, Rach.

504
00:52:04,994 --> 00:52:06,343
But we do, right?

505
00:52:06,959 --> 00:52:08,220
Yeah, we do.

506
00:52:20,562 --> 00:52:21,783
Why they do that?

507
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,770
Why?

508
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,105
Everybody just wants to ride.

509
00:52:28,105 --> 00:52:30,551
- Can't we get them one?
- Sit back.

510
00:52:30,551 --> 00:52:34,881
Put on your seat-belt, Rachel!

511
00:52:45,983 --> 00:52:49,953
I'm sorry, I can't.
Please, get away from the car.

512
00:52:50,685 --> 00:52:52,173
Stop the car!

513
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,266
20 people in there!

514
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:01,115
Hold on!

515
00:53:20,205 --> 00:53:21,276
Are you OK?

516
00:53:36,135 --> 00:53:38,216
Wait!

517
00:53:44,018 --> 00:53:44,938
Get out of here!

518
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,331
Get in the car!

519
00:54:08,753 --> 00:54:10,786
Rachel, get ouf of the car!

520
00:54:20,395 --> 00:54:21,695
Take it easy!

521
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:23,827
Get off the car!

522
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,118
Move!

523
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,120
Where's my son?

524
00:54:31,457 --> 00:54:32,656
Robbie!

525
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:34,170
Put the gun down.

526
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:45,584
Listen...

527
00:54:45,894 --> 00:54:48,065
Put down the gun.
I'm taking the car.

528
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:49,277
My daughter's in the car.

529
00:54:49,277 --> 00:54:53,525
- Put down the gun!
- All I want is...

530
00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:54,390
my daughter.

531
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:59,027
- I'm taking you the car.
- Let me just my daughter.

532
00:54:59,027 --> 00:55:00,151
Listen, all I want is my daughter.

533
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:01,067
Yeah, yeah.

534
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:03,716
Robbie!
