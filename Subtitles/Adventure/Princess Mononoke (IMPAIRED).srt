[Man Narrating]
In ancient times, the land
lay covered in forests,

2
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:41,844
where, from ages long past,
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

3
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:47,725
Back then, man and beast
lived in harmony,

4
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:51,924
but as time went by, most
of the great forests were destroyed.

5
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:56,722
Those that remained were guarded
by gigantic beasts...

6
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,560
who owed their allegiance
to the Great Forest Spirit,

7
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:04,400
for those were the days
of gods and demons.

- Girls!
- Ashitaka!

11
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:51,280
There's something strange going on.
You have to hurry.

12
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:53,356
The wise woman wants everybody back
to the village at once.

13
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,322
- We just came from Ji-san.
- Did he see something?

14
00:01:55,405 --> 00:01:57,202
Yes, in the forest.
Something's wrong.

15
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,923
- The birds have gone.
- The animals too.

16
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,757
I'll go to the watchtower
and check with Ji-san.

17
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:02,756
You three hurry back home
and be quick about it.

18
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:04,676
All right.
Be careful!

19

Something's there.

22
00:02:47,645 --> 00:02:51,684
- Ji-san, did you see it too?
- I did. It isn't human.

23
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:55,235
The wise woman's calling everybody
back to the village.

24
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:57,202
There. Look.

25
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:27,315
- It's some kind of demon!
- A demon?

It's headed for the village.
I've got to stop it.

Prince Ashitaka, wait!
Be careful!

31
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,914
That thing is cursed!
Don't let it touch you!

32

Here, Yakul!
[Whistles]

Are you all right?

This wound is evil.
- The prince has been hurt.

- Where is the wise woman?
- [Man] Here she comes!

You must keep away from him, all of you.
Everyone, stay back.

I bow before you.

57
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:03,924
A mound will be raised and
funeral rites performed on this
ground where you have fallen.

58
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:06,678
Pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred.

Disgusting little creatures,

soon all of you
will feel my hate...

as I have suffered.

I'm afraid this is very bad.

00:07:56,964 --> 00:08:00,718
The stones tell me the boar god
came from far to the west.

68
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:04,638
He had some kind of poison inside him,
driving him mad,

69
00:08:04,724 --> 00:08:08,194
a poisonous hatred that consumed
his heart and flesh...

70
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:11,640
and turned him
into a demon monster.

- Prince Ashitaka?
- Yes?

Show everyone
your right arm.

- [Gasping]
- What's it mean?

74
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:29,080
My prince, are you
prepared to learn...

75
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:31,632
what fate the stones
have foretold you?

76
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:35,239
Yes, I was prepared
the very moment that
I let my arrow fly.

00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:37,155
Mmm.

78
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:41,476
The infection will spread
throughout your whole body,
bone and flesh alike.

79
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:46,001
It will cause you great pain
and then kill you.

80
00:08:46,084 --> 00:08:47,915
Is there no way
we can stop it?

81
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:51,394
The prince got that wound
by defending our village
and saving our lives!

82
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:53,679
Do we just sit here
and watch him die?

83
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:57,279
You cannot alter
your fate, my prince.

84
00:08:57,364 --> 00:09:00,720
However, you can rise
to meet it, if you choose.

85
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:02,681
Look at this.

86
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:07,519
This iron ball was found
in the boar's body.

87
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:09,674
This is what hurt him so.

88
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:14,280
It shattered his bones and
burned its way deep inside him.

89
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:17,117
This is what turned him
into a demon.

90
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:21,914
There is evil at work in the land
to the west, Prince Ashitaka.

91
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:26,395
It's your fate to go there
and see what you can see
with eyes unclouded by hate.

92
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:29,282
You may find a way
to lift the curse.

93
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:31,195
- You understand?
- Yes.

94
00:09:32,604 --> 00:09:35,516
We are the last
of the Emishi.

95
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:39,313
It's 500 years since the Emperor
destroyed our tribe...

96
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:42,874
and drove the remnants
of our people to the east.

97
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:46,240
Some managed to survive here
for all these years,

98
00:09:46,324 --> 00:09:51,444
but the blood of our tribe
has grown thinner and weaker
with each generation.

99
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:56,518
Now our last prince must
cut his hair and leave us,
never to return?

100
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:59,596
Sometimes I think the gods
are laughing at us.

101
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:16,077
Our laws forbid us from watching you go,
Ashitaka.

102
00:10:16,164 --> 00:10:19,634
Whatever comes to pass now,
you are dead to us forever.

103

You know it's forbidden.

Do you think
I care about that?

106

I came to give you this so you won't
forget your little sister.

107

Your crystal dagger.
Kaya, I can't take this.

Please, keep it with you,

No? All right.

we're being followed.

156
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:19,514
That's what we get for waving that
gold nugget around.

157
00:15:19,604 --> 00:15:23,119
They'll wait till we're asleep,
then slit our throats.

158
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:28,915
What to you say we give 'em
a little demonstration
of how fast we can run, huh?

159
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:40,599
So the demon monster turned out to be
a giant boar.

160
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:43,118
I followed its trail westward through
the mountains...

161
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:45,354
to where the samurai were attacking
those villagers.

162
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,594
- But then...
- You lost it. That's life.

163

See this place here?

164
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:53,922
When I came here last, a few years back,
this was a lovely little village.

165
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:57,121
But then there must have been
a flood or a landslide or a fire.

166
00:15:57,204 --> 00:15:59,798
The only sure thing
is that everybody's dead.

167
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:04,913
These days, there are
angry ghosts all around us,

168
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:07,598
dead from wars,
sickness, starvation.

169
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:09,515
And nobody cares.

170
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:14,155
So you say you're under a curse?
So what? So's the whole damn world.

171
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:17,361
[Blows] Mmm! Ahh!

172
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:22,916
I was wrong to fight in that village.
Two men are dead because of me.

173
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:26,394

You win some, you lose some.

174

Hand me your bowl.
My point is, everybody dies.
Some now, some later.

From brothel girl
to Emperor.

176
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:35,843
I've heard them say that the Emperor
has promised...

177
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:39,280
an entire hill of gold to anyone
who can help him live forever.

178
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:42,834
Beautiful bowl.
I've seen one other like it.

179
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:46,234
Have you ever heard
of the Emishi people?
They're said to ride red elks.

180
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:49,396
They also use stone arrowheads
just like you.

181
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:56,113
Of course, they were all
wiped out 500 years ago.

182

Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone where you're from.

much bigger fish to fry.

anything like this before?

Never have.

186
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:13,283
It came from the giant boar.
It was inside him.

187
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:17,152
I'm sure it was that little ball of iron
that killed him.

190

It's where the spirit of the

00:28:53,324 --> 00:28:57,078
- It's Kohroku! He's alive!
- Kohroku's alive!

310
00:28:57,164 --> 00:29:00,873
- It's true! Kohroku's still alive!
- Let's go see!

311
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:03,080
Quiet! Stop that noise!

312
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:05,632
I'm trying to tally these accounts here,
so shut up!

313
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:09,319
- Haven't you heard? Kohroku's
come back from the dead!
- What?

314
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:12,362
[Chattering]

315
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:16,198
- There they are!
- There he is!

316
00:29:16,284 --> 00:29:20,800
- That's it.
- [Nickers]

317
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,921
- This is unbelievable.
- Where are the others, Kohroku?

318
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:27,553
- Yes, is my son with you?
- I'm afraid we're the only ones
who made it.

319
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:29,475
[Groans]

320
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:32,874
It's never the guards that die.

321
00:29:32,964 --> 00:29:34,795
Stand aside.

322
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:37,762
That man in the weird costume, sir?
Who do you think it could be?

323
00:29:37,844 --> 00:29:39,675
He's obviously an outsider.

324
00:29:39,764 --> 00:29:41,595
- Be careful.
- Listen to me, everyone!

325
00:29:41,684 --> 00:29:46,200
This stranger saved our lives.
He carried the rifleman
all the way back here.

326
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:51,074
You should be grateful to him.
Ow! Hey, watch the arm.

327
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,075
- [Whimpering]
- Sir.

328
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:57,635
[Grunts]
Hold it right there.

329
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:10,037
I'm very grateful for you bringing
these men back to us, stranger,

330
00:30:10,124 --> 00:30:12,240
but something
doesn't smell right.

331
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:15,873
You got back almost as fast as we did
and through the forbidden forest.

332
00:30:15,964 --> 00:30:18,603
On top of that, you did it
with two badly injured men,

333
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:21,482
- and you want me
to believe that you...
- Kohroku! Kohroku!

334
00:30:21,564 --> 00:30:24,124
- You're alive!
- Toki, my love!

335
00:30:24,204 --> 00:30:26,479
- [Gasps]
- Huh?

336
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:31,001
That's just great!
How are you gonna drive the ox
now all banged up and mangled?

337
00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:33,040
- But, my little flower...
- You scared me half to death.

338
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,354
Don't you "little flower" me.
I wish the wolves had eaten you.

339
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:38,004
Then maybe I could have
found a real husband!

340
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:40,393
Sweetness, can we
discuss this later?

341
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:44,193
Toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time.

342
00:30:44,284 --> 00:30:47,594
And as for you, Gonza, a fine
captain of the guard you are,

343
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:50,482
always strutting and
throwing your weight around
once the danger's over.

344
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:52,395
You never do a lick
of work around here.

345
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,315
That's unfair and untrue.

346
00:30:54,404 --> 00:30:57,680
Thanks, stranger.
My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe and sound.

347
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:02,633
That's a relief. I was starting
to think I'd done something
wrong by bringing him back home.

348
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:05,682
[Laughing]

349
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:09,279
Say, why don't you take the mask off?
I bet you're really handsome.

350
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:11,195
[Woman] Gonza?

351
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:13,514
Bring the stranger
to me later.

352
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,754
I would like
to thank him personally.

353
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:18,483
- Kohroku.
- Uh, yes?

354
00:31:18,564 --> 00:31:22,034
- I'm happy you're back, and I apologize.
- Uh, okay.

355
00:31:22,124 --> 00:31:24,354
Uh-oh, milady, you really shouldn't
tell him things like that.

356
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:26,355
If you're too nice to him,
he'll walk all over you.

357
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:31,154
I hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki.
I was responsible.
I should never have let it happen.

358
00:31:31,244 --> 00:31:33,838
Oh, that's all right. Milady,
if you hadn't been there,

359
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:38,634
the wolves would have eaten
everyone, and then we'd all have
to find ourselves new husbands.

360
00:31:38,724 --> 00:31:43,161
Get some rest, traveller.
I will see you this evening.

361
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:49,233
Oh, hey! You're not handsome,
you're gorgeous!

362
00:31:49,404 --> 00:31:52,760
[Pounding]

363
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:58,558
[Pounding Continues]

364
00:31:59,844 --> 00:32:02,404
- Pull!
- [Grunting]

365
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:10,757
[Chattering]

366
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:18,480
Here! You know, they had to fight off
wolves to get this rice through.

367
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,395
Just dish it out!

368
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:22,952
- [Chattering]
- There he is!

369
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:25,080
- Where is he?
- Over there in the back.

370
00:32:25,164 --> 00:32:27,359
Toki was right.
He is handsome.

371
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,400
- Yeah, not bad.
- But he's so young!

372
00:32:29,484 --> 00:32:32,874
- That never stopped you before.
- [Women Laughing]

373
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:34,795
Quiet out there!
We lost some good men today.

374
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:37,114
Yeah, there's lots of
gorgeous men in here, honey!

375
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:39,115
I've seen cattle
that looked better.

376
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:41,843
Listen, stranger.
Why don't you come over to our place?

377
00:32:41,924 --> 00:32:43,801
You don't want to stay
in this stinking old barn.

378
00:32:43,884 --> 00:32:46,398
Look, woman! We risked our lives
to bring you the rice...

379
00:32:46,484 --> 00:32:48,361
you're all eating tonight,
so watch your mouth.

380
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:51,595
And who made the iron that paid
for that rice, huh? Tell me that.

381
00:32:51,684 --> 00:32:54,881
Yeah, we're pumping those bellows
while you pigs are in bed.

382
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:57,717
Actually, if it's not too much
trouble, ladies, I would like
to see where you work.

383
00:32:57,804 --> 00:33:00,682
- You would?
- We'll have to work in make-up tonight.

384
00:33:00,764 --> 00:33:02,595
Lend me your lipstick.

385
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:04,515
- Don't be a stranger.
- Don't forget now.

386
00:33:04,604 --> 00:33:06,435
We'll be waiting for you.

387
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:11,234
It's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.

388
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,997
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten.
That's why they're like that.

389
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:16,279
They say that happy women
make a happy village.

390
00:33:16,364 --> 00:33:19,834
Happy? Ha!
Those kind of women workin' here?

391
00:33:19,924 --> 00:33:22,757
Women like that... It's a disgrace.
They defile the iron.

392
00:33:22,844 --> 00:33:27,201
Lady Eboshi goes around
buying the contract of
every brothel girl she can find.

393
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:29,559
Milady has a kind heart,
that's all.

394
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:31,521
You got rice
on your chin, old man.

395
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:34,914
It's true. Everything here has turned
upside-down since she showed up.

396
00:33:35,004 --> 00:33:37,996
That's right. She's not even afraid
of the gods, that woman.

397
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:41,156
You should have seen the way she dealt
with Nago. Am I right?

398
00:33:41,244 --> 00:33:43,883
- Who's Nago?
- "Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god.

399
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:45,795
He used to rule
this whole forest.

400
00:33:45,884 --> 00:33:48,603
We couldn't even get near the mountains
with him around.

401
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,959
Nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months,

402
00:33:51,044 --> 00:33:52,875
starin' at a bunch
of angry boars.

403
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,637
Mm-hmm. See, the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out.

404
00:33:55,724 --> 00:34:00,718
Then we tried to get at the iron
under the mountain, but Nago
wasn't gonna stand for that.

405
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:04,558
The problem was, before
we could dig for the iron,
we had to clear away the forest,

406
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:06,475
and that's what
made the boar angry.

407
00:34:06,564 --> 00:34:10,477
[Screaming]

408
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:17,800
[Screaming]

409
00:34:19,844 --> 00:34:21,960
[Laughing]

410
00:34:22,044 --> 00:34:24,842
He's feeling no pain.

411
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:29,915
Then one day Lady Eboshi came along
with her warriors and her rifles.

412
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:41,602
[Shrieking]

413
00:34:55,604 --> 00:34:57,834
Young man, what's wrong?

414
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:03,116
Is something
hurting your arm?

415
00:35:03,204 --> 00:35:06,514
No, I was just thinking
about the boar god.

416
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,199
I was thinking how he must
have died filled with hate.

417
00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:14,438
[Hammering Continues]

418
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:18,403
Forgive me for keeping you
waiting, stranger.

419
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,315
That's good iron.

420
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:24,033
We were running behind
with tomorrow's shipment.

421
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:25,955
Let's have a rest.

422
00:35:26,044 --> 00:35:29,002
- You may tell the others.
- Yes, ma'am.

423
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:32,679
Some think you're either a spy
for the Wolf Girl or for Lord Asano
and his samurai.

424
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:36,518
There are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron.

425
00:35:36,604 --> 00:35:38,640
Why are you here,
if you don't mind my asking?

426
00:35:44,364 --> 00:35:46,673
I believe
you'll recognize this.

427
00:35:46,764 --> 00:35:49,756
It shattered the bones
of a giant boar,

428
00:35:49,844 --> 00:35:52,438
rotted his flesh and
turned him into a monster.

429
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:55,800
I fought with him,
and for that I was cursed
with this mark on my arm,

430
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:57,715
and soon it will kill me.

431
00:35:57,804 --> 00:36:01,558
Where is it you come from?
I've never seen a red elk
like that before.

432
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:06,593
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.

433
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:09,756
[Growls] Answer milady's question
or I'll cut you in half!

434
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:12,404
What do you plan to do?
What exactly are you here for?

435
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:16,159
To see with eyes
unclouded by hate.

436
00:36:16,244 --> 00:36:20,954
"Eyes unclouded"?
[Laughing]

437
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:24,393
That explains it.

438
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:26,952
Come. I'll show you all my secrets.

439
00:36:27,044 --> 00:36:30,002
- Is that wise, milady?
- Gonza, take over for me.

440
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:33,042
Oh. [Grunts]

441
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:34,955
[Chattering]

442
00:37:05,884 --> 00:37:10,116
[Grunting]

443
00:37:28,364 --> 00:37:31,640
This is my garden. None
of the townspeople dare to come here.

444
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:36,400
Follow me if you wish
to learn my secret.

445
00:37:42,004 --> 00:37:44,916
- [Clucking]
- Good evening.

446
00:37:47,404 --> 00:37:50,794
[Chattering, Laughing]

447
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:54,394
[Woman] We've only just
finished it, milady.

448
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:56,520
It's still too heavy.

449
00:37:56,604 --> 00:37:58,481
Perhaps if you didn't
hold it so delicately?

450
00:37:58,564 --> 00:38:01,362
Milady, if we make them
any lighter, they'll fall apart.

451
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,594
I trust you to figure it out.

452
00:38:03,684 --> 00:38:06,437
They're not for me.
They're for the other women here.

453
00:38:06,524 --> 00:38:08,401
[Woman]
That'll be something to see.

454
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:11,874
This is the latest rifle
that I've asked these people to design.

455
00:38:11,964 --> 00:38:14,159
The ones we brought here
have turned out to be too heavy.

456
00:38:14,244 --> 00:38:19,159
These will kill
forest monsters and pierce
the thickest samurai armour.

457
00:38:19,244 --> 00:38:22,202
You better watch out there, young man.
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world.

458
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:24,957
I'm sorry to have
to push you all so hard.

459
00:38:25,044 --> 00:38:27,717
- I'll have wine sent down later.
- Oh, that'll be nice.

460
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:32,355
First you steal
the boar's forest from him and
then transform him into a demon.

461
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,639
Now you're making
even deadlier weapons!

462
00:38:34,724 --> 00:38:37,318
How much more hatred and pain
do you think we need?

463
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:40,874
Yes, I'm the one who shot the boar,
and I'm sorry that you suffer.

464
00:38:40,964 --> 00:38:42,795
I truly am.

465
00:38:42,884 --> 00:38:45,956
That brainless pig.
I'm the one he should have
put a curse on, not you.

466
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:57,324
[Grunting]

467
00:38:57,404 --> 00:38:58,883
- No!
- [Gasping]

468
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:05,840
Does that right hand of yours
wish to kill me now, Ashitaka?

469
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:08,916
If it would lift the curse,
I'd let it tear you apart,

470
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:11,154
but even that wouldn't end
the killing now, would it?

471
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:14,156
No, it wouldn't. It would have to kill
all of us to be at peace.

472
00:39:14,244 --> 00:39:18,123
Milady, Osa has
something to say.

473
00:39:19,964 --> 00:39:22,273
Forgive me, milady.

474
00:39:22,364 --> 00:39:25,800
You must not make light
of the boy's strength.

475
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:29,797
Young man, like you,
I know what rage feels like...

476
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:32,034
and grief and helplessness.

477
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:36,754
But you must not take
your revenge on Lady Eboshi.

478
00:39:36,844 --> 00:39:41,634
She is the only one
who saw us as human beings.

479
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:45,842
We are lepers.
The world hates and fears us,

480
00:39:45,924 --> 00:39:49,997
but she took us in and washed
our rotting flesh and bandaged us.

481
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:53,520
- [Coughing]
- Osa?

482
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:55,720
Life is suffering.

483
00:39:55,804 --> 00:39:57,999
It is hard.
The world is cursed,

484
00:39:58,084 --> 00:40:03,112
but still, you find reasons
to keep living.

485
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:05,160
I'm sorry.
I'm making no sense.

486
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:08,042
[Wolf Howling]

487
00:40:23,444 --> 00:40:25,833
Oh, they just keep coming back.

488
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,438
Every night they're
out there planting trees,

489
00:40:28,524 --> 00:40:30,719
trying to turn the mountain
into a forest again.

490
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:34,080
Stay here. Help me kill
the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka.

491
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:37,315
You would do that?
Kill the very heart of the forest?

492
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:41,716
Without that ancient god the
animals here would be nothing
but dumb beasts once more.

493
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:44,079
When the forest has been cleared
and the wolves wiped out,

494
00:40:44,164 --> 00:40:46,917
this desolate place will be
the richest land in the world,

495
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:48,835
and Princess Mononoke
will become human.

496
00:40:48,924 --> 00:40:50,994
Princess Mononoke?

497
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:54,793
Princess of the spirits of ghouls,
beasts and ancient gods.

498
00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:57,079
The wolf stole her soul,
and now she lives to kill me.

499
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,041
[Ringing]

500
00:41:01,884 --> 00:41:06,002
The legends say the blood
of the Great Forest's Spirit
can heal anything.

501
00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:08,552
Perhaps it could cure
my poor lepers.

502
00:41:08,644 --> 00:41:11,442
Might even be able to lift
your curse, Ashitaka.

503
00:41:11,524 --> 00:41:15,119
Milady! How does the action feel to you?
Better?

504
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:17,957
Smooth as silk, the perfect
thing for ruling the world.

505
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:20,274
- Ah!
- It's still too heavy for the girls.

506
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:22,195
All right.

- Well, look who's here.

511
00:41:50,164 --> 00:41:53,122
Evening. All right if I work
the bellows for a while?

512
00:41:53,204 --> 00:41:56,719
- Well, I guess so.
- [Grunts]

513
00:41:56,804 --> 00:41:59,602
- Excuse me. May I try it?
- Huh?

514
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,118
It's okay.
Might as well let him try.

515

517

When you get tired,
I'll take over for you.

518
00:42:15,964 --> 00:42:18,034
Well, that won't be long.

519
00:42:18,124 --> 00:42:20,763
Oops! Better keep
that kimono shut tight, girl.

520
00:42:20,844 --> 00:42:23,802
I'm impressed, but you'll
never keep that pace up.

521
00:42:23,884 --> 00:42:26,114
- It's hard work, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

522
00:42:26,204 --> 00:42:28,718
You bet, and our shifts
are four days long.

523
00:42:28,804 --> 00:42:31,272
You must lead hard lives here.

524
00:42:31,364 --> 00:42:35,915
Yeah, I suppose. But it sure beats
working a brothel in the city, huh?

525
00:42:36,004 --> 00:42:39,440
Here we get to eat as much as we want,
and the men don't bother us!

526
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:43,756
- Unless we want 'em to!

- No!
- But you can't leave tomorrow.

531
00:43:26,323 --> 00:43:28,314
- Can't you stay a little longer?
- You can stay and work here.

532
00:43:28,403 --> 00:43:31,998
Thank you all, but there's
someone I have to find
out there in the forest.

I'm a friend.

- She's on the roof
- Hurry! She's after Lady Eboshi!

00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:38,759

Now, don't get excited.
Keep those bellows working.

Whatever happens, we can't
let those fires go out.

553

- Is she alone?
- Yes.

554

She can't escape.
We have her cornered.

You know she means
to kill you this time.

If it's me you want,
here I am.

If you seek revenge for
all the animals we've killed,

562
00:45:24,443 --> 00:45:27,594
well, there are two women down
here whom I'd like you to meet.

and he told me about you...

765
01:03:55,003 --> 01:03:58,200
about your village,
your people and your forest.

766
01:03:58,283 --> 01:04:02,595
The Forest Spirit
brought you back to life again.
He wants you to live.

767
01:04:02,683 --> 01:04:05,072
I had the strangest dream.

768
01:04:05,163 --> 01:04:09,122
- There was a golden creature.
- Eat this.

[Squealing]

776
01:05:39,683 --> 01:05:44,040
We are here to kill the humans
and save the forest.

777
01:05:44,123 --> 01:05:46,318
Why are there
humans here, Moro?

778
01:05:46,403 --> 01:05:48,917
Humans are everywhere
these days.

779
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:52,200
Go back to your own mountain.
Kill them there.

780
01:05:52,283 --> 01:05:54,274
The girl is San, my daughter.

781
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:57,958
We will kill them here.
We will save this forest.

782
01:05:58,043 --> 01:06:00,682
What is that other human
doing here?

783
01:06:00,763 --> 01:06:03,277
He was shot, and then the Great Spirit
healed his wound.

784
01:06:03,363 --> 01:06:05,194
This man is not our enemy!

785
01:06:05,283 --> 01:06:08,355
The Forest Spirit saved him?

786
01:06:08,443 --> 01:06:11,435
Saved the life
of that loathsome runt?

787
01:06:11,523 --> 01:06:14,321
Why didn't he save Nago?

788
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:17,679
Is he not the guardian
of the forest? Why?

789
01:06:17,763 --> 01:06:22,120
The Forest Spirit gives life
and takes life away.

790
01:06:22,203 --> 01:06:25,479
Life and death are his alone,
or have you boars forgotten that?

791
01:06:25,563 --> 01:06:30,000
You lie! You must have begged
the Forest Spirit to spare his life!

792
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:31,914
But you did not beg
for Nago, did you?

793
01:06:32,003 --> 01:06:34,119
[Moro]
Nago was afraid to die.

794
01:06:34,203 --> 01:06:38,594
Now I, too, carry within my breast
a poisoned human bullet.

795
01:06:38,683 --> 01:06:41,720
Nago fled,
and the darkness took him.

796
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:44,875
I remain and contemplate my death.

797
01:06:44,963 --> 01:06:47,636
Mother! Please ask
the Forest Spirit to save you.

798
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:50,283
I have lived long enough, San.

799
01:06:50,363 --> 01:06:53,355
Soon the Forest Spirit
will let me rest forever.

800
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,515
All these years you
defended the Forest Spirit!
He must save you!

801
01:06:56,603 --> 01:07:00,915
You are not fooling us.
Nago was beautiful and strong.

802
01:07:01,003 --> 01:07:04,996
He would not have run from anything.
You wolves must have eaten him!

803
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:08,314
Quiet! Watch what you say,
you filthy pig!

804
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:11,201
[Ashitaka] Gods of the mountain,
please listen to me.

805
01:07:11,283 --> 01:07:14,798
Nago died far from here,
and I was the one who killed him.

806
01:07:14,883 --> 01:07:17,317
He had become
some kind of demon.

807
01:07:17,403 --> 01:07:19,553
One day he attacked
our village.

808
01:07:19,643 --> 01:07:23,238
If you want proof,
look at my hand where he touched me.

809
01:07:28,123 --> 01:07:33,402
I came here to beg the Forest Spirit
to lift Nago's curse from me.

810
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:37,112
He healed the bullet wound in my side,
but the demon mark remains.

811
01:07:38,523 --> 01:07:42,914
First it will tear my soul apart,
and then it will kill me.

812
01:07:43,003 --> 01:07:44,834
[Squealing]

813
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:50,917
Okkoto, finally,
a boar who will listen to reason.

814
01:07:55,523 --> 01:07:59,152
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!
Please, you mustn't eat him.

815
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:02,918
Ah, you are Moro's
human child, aren't you?

816
01:08:03,003 --> 01:08:04,834
I have heard of you.

817
01:08:05,843 --> 01:08:07,674
[Gasps] You're blind.

818
01:08:07,763 --> 01:08:11,438
Stand back.
I will not eat him.

819
01:08:11,523 --> 01:08:13,434
It's all right, San.

820
01:08:13,523 --> 01:08:18,392
My Lord Okkoto, what I said about
Nago's death was the truth.

821

[Grunts]

822
01:08:28,803 --> 01:08:32,637
I believe you,
and I thank you for it, young one.

823
01:08:32,723 --> 01:08:38,116
I am only grieved and ashamed that such
a demon has come from our tribe.

[Whimpers]

825
01:08:40,243 --> 01:08:44,475
O mighty lord, is there a way
to lift Nago's curse from me?

826
01:08:44,563 --> 01:08:47,521
Leave this forest...

827
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:50,913
for the next time we meet
I will have to kill you.

828
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:55,713
You cannot win against the humans.
Their guns will destroy you all.

829
01:08:55,803 --> 01:08:58,078
Look on my tribe, Moro.

830
01:08:58,163 --> 01:09:01,633
We grow small,
and we grow stupid.

831
01:09:01,723 --> 01:09:04,760
We will soon be nothing
but squealing game...

832
01:09:04,843 --> 01:09:06,959
that the humans
hunt for their meat.

833
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:09,762
You'd risk everything
on one last battle?

834
01:09:09,843 --> 01:09:11,720
That's just
what the humans want.

835
01:09:11,803 --> 01:09:15,682
I do not ask for the help
of the wolf tribe.

836
01:09:15,763 --> 01:09:17,594
Even if every one of us dies,

837
01:09:17,683 --> 01:09:21,835
it will be a battle
the humans will never forget.

Well, I've got the Emperor
breathing down my neck,

863
01:11:23,563 --> 01:11:25,918
and you're busy playing war
with Lord Asano.

864
01:11:26,003 --> 01:11:29,916
And you would have nothing to do
with Lord Asano being here,
now, would you?

865
01:11:30,003 --> 01:11:32,358
Of course not.
Whatever made you think that?

866
01:11:32,443 --> 01:11:35,116
He'll call a truce
if I give him half my iron.

Is that right?
Well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?

But all the same, you might as well
let him have his iron.

Listen, Eboshi, the boars
are gathering for battle.
And you know what that means.

You made me a promise.
Now, once you get me

then we can come back

just fine from down there.

something, you want it!

Do you have any idea
who this paper has come from?
From the Emperor himself.

- That's nice. Who's he?
- Is he supposed to be important?

- Yes! They're really something.

Yes, milady.

and dig for iron, the forest
and its creatures grow weaker.

no loss of life, Jigo.

Listen, you owe me
and I've come to collect.

908

I sent them, and without those riflemen,
you lose Irontown.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Did that sound like a threat?

the Emperor believes...

They're much easier to kill
than Moro and her wolf cubs,

916
01:14:08,643 --> 01:14:13,159
So you can call out
that shady bunch you've got
hidden under the cliff, Jigo.

917
01:14:13,243 --> 01:14:16,997
[Laughs]
So I've been found out.

918
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:19,199
Oh, just one more thing, milady.

919
01:14:19,283 --> 01:14:22,559
Did a stranger come through here,
by any chance?

920
01:14:22,643 --> 01:14:25,874
He's a young man
riding a great big red elk.

921
01:14:25,963 --> 01:14:29,000
Came and went.

922
01:14:45,923 --> 01:14:48,039
A bad-looking bunch,
if you ask me.

923
01:14:48,123 --> 01:14:50,159
Those men are
no ordinary hunters.

924
01:14:50,243 --> 01:14:52,074
- They're killers.
- Killers?

925
01:14:52,163 --> 01:14:54,472
Milady, at least let
some of us go with you.

926
01:14:54,563 --> 01:14:56,394
Yes, you can't trust these men.
They're strangers.

927
01:14:56,483 --> 01:14:59,441
What if something goes wrong
and we're stuck here?
We can't help you.

928
01:14:59,523 --> 01:15:01,479
You said yourself we're better shots
than the men are.

929
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:05,238
That's precisely why I want
you all here in Irontown.

930
01:15:05,323 --> 01:15:08,395
I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.

931
01:15:08,483 --> 01:15:12,396
Once the Forest Spirit is dead,
we don't know what will happen.

932
01:15:12,483 --> 01:15:14,792
Will Jigo be satisfied
with the creature's head...

933
01:15:14,883 --> 01:15:16,919
or will he be after
my ironworks as well?

934
01:15:17,003 --> 01:15:19,722
Jigo's riflemen
may turn on us.

935
01:15:19,803 --> 01:15:23,113
If that happens, I'll need
every one of you here to fight them.

936
01:15:23,203 --> 01:15:25,637
Remember,
you can't trust men.

937
01:15:25,723 --> 01:15:27,679
Don't worry
about her ladyship.

938
01:15:27,763 --> 01:15:29,913
I'll be right at her side,
protecting her.

939
01:15:30,003 --> 01:15:32,312
- That's what we're afraid of.
- What?

940
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:35,236
Even if you were a woman,
you'd still be an idiot!

[All Laughing]

942
01:15:38,883 --> 01:15:44,401
In the moonlight
I felt your heart

943
01:15:44,483 --> 01:15:49,352
- Quiver like
a bowstring's pulse
- [Shuddering]

01:15:52,443 --> 01:15:55,674
You looked at me

946
01:15:55,763 --> 01:16:01,156
Nobody knows your heart

947
01:16:01,243 --> 01:16:06,636
When the sun has gone
I see you

948
01:16:06,723 --> 01:16:11,638
Beautiful and haunting
but cold

949
01:16:11,723 --> 01:16:17,355
- Like the blade of a knife
so sharp, so sweet
- [Groaning]

All of your sorrow
grief and pain

Locked away
in the forest of the night

Your secret heart
belongs to the world

- [Moro] You know,
you could always jump, boy.

End it all.

956
01:16:47,283 --> 01:16:52,198
As soon as your strength returns,
the mark will spread and destroy you.

957
01:16:52,283 --> 01:16:55,719
It feels like I must
have been asleep for weeks.

958
01:16:55,803 --> 01:16:58,920
I had a dream that San
was by my side, nursing me.

959
01:16:59,003 --> 01:17:02,120
I was hoping you'd cry out
in your sleep.

960
01:17:02,203 --> 01:17:05,240
Then I would have bitten
your head off to silence you.

961
01:17:05,323 --> 01:17:09,475
It's a beautiful forest. Are Okkoto
and the boars on the move yet?

962
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:12,794
Yes, the boars are marching.

963
01:17:12,883 --> 01:17:16,671
The trees cry out as they die,
but you cannot hear them.

964
01:17:16,763 --> 01:17:20,722
I lie here.
I listen to the pain of the forest...

965
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:23,636
and feel the ache
of the bullet in my chest...

966
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:28,319
and dream of the day when I will
finally crunch that gun woman's
head in my jaws.

967
01:17:28,403 --> 01:17:32,112
Moro, why can't the humans
and the forest live together?

968
01:17:32,203 --> 01:17:34,080
Why can't we stop
this fighting now?

969
01:17:34,163 --> 01:17:36,996
The humans are gathering
for the final battle.

970
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:39,233
The flames of their guns
will burn us all.

971
01:17:39,323 --> 01:17:42,599
And what happens to San?
What's your plan,
to let her die with you?

972
01:17:42,683 --> 01:17:46,392
Typical. Selfish.
You think like a human.

973
01:17:46,483 --> 01:17:50,237
San is my daughter.
She is of the wolf tribe.

974
01:17:50,323 --> 01:17:52,678
When the forest dies,
so does she.

975
01:17:52,763 --> 01:17:55,277
You must set her free!
She's not a wolf! She's human!

976
01:17:55,363 --> 01:17:57,479
Silence, boy.

977
01:17:57,563 --> 01:18:00,475
How dare you speak
to a god like that.

978
01:18:00,563 --> 01:18:04,033
I caught her human parents
defiling my forest.

979
01:18:04,123 --> 01:18:06,796
They threw their baby
at my feet as they ran away.

980
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:09,955
Instead of eating her,
I raised her as my own.

981
01:18:10,043 --> 01:18:14,798
Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter
is neither human nor wolf.

982
01:18:14,883 --> 01:18:17,522
How could you help her?

I don't know, but at least
we might find a way to live.

[Laughing] How?

985
01:18:23,843 --> 01:18:27,438
Will you join forces with San
and fight the humans?

986
01:18:27,523 --> 01:18:30,799
No. All that would do
is cause more hatred.

987
01:18:30,883 --> 01:18:34,114
There is nothing
you can do, boy.

988

Soon the demon mark
will spread and kill you.

him or else they'll be killed!

01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:56,520
- Oh, I do?
- Oh, you're useless.

1066
01:26:56,603 --> 01:26:58,719
Many thanks, Kohroku!

1067
01:26:58,803 --> 01:27:01,317
I'll try and bring you some help!
Can you hold out?

1068
01:27:01,403 --> 01:27:04,793
Don't worry! We can always pour
hot iron on them.

1069
01:27:04,883 --> 01:27:08,273
- Bring back Lady Eboshi!
- And don't take too long!

1070
01:27:09,523 --> 01:27:11,878
[Shouting]

01:27:11,963 --> 01:27:14,397
[Laughs] I missed.

1072
01:27:14,483 --> 01:27:16,633
They're bringing boats
across the river!

1073
01:27:16,723 --> 01:27:21,239
Go and get Lady Eboshi.
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

1074
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:23,712
I'll be back! I promise!

1075
01:27:26,363 --> 01:27:28,558
- We'll be here!
- Be careful! [Whimpers]

1076
01:27:30,403 --> 01:27:32,963
Get him!
Stop that man!

1077
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:44,392
Looks like they're gonna
try to cut us off. Run, Yakul.

1078
01:27:59,163 --> 01:28:01,119
You two, go that way!

Stay back!

1091
01:29:24,723 --> 01:29:27,999
Show me your wound.

1092
01:29:28,083 --> 01:29:31,473
You'll have to stay here. Wait for me.
I'll come back for you.

1093
01:29:34,323 --> 01:29:36,154
I said, stay!

1094
01:29:45,923 --> 01:29:47,754
We're almost there,
my friend.

1095

[Man] Who goes there?

1096
01:30:33,563 --> 01:30:35,519
My orders are no outsiders
permitted here.

1097
01:30:35,603 --> 01:30:38,163
All right, but I've
just come from Irontown.

1098
01:30:38,243 --> 01:30:40,803
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
Tell me where I can find her.

1099
01:30:40,883 --> 01:30:44,876
The Eboshi woman's not here.
Give me the message.
I'll make sure she gets it.

1100
01:30:44,963 --> 01:30:47,636
I must speak with her.
Now where is she?

1101
01:30:47,723 --> 01:30:51,318
It's really you?
You're still alive, lad?

1102
01:30:51,403 --> 01:30:53,758
It looks like you men
had a worse time than I did.

1103
01:30:53,843 --> 01:30:56,721
- We've been burying
our friends all day.
- Oh, it was horrible, horrible.

1104
01:30:56,803 --> 01:30:59,954
- Irontown has come under attack.
- What?

1105
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:02,637
The women and the lepers
have fallen back to the inner wall.

1106
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:05,521
- We haven't got a lot of time.
- Those samurai bastards.

1107
01:31:05,603 --> 01:31:07,753
Asano must have just been waiting
for us to leave Irontown.

1108
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:10,073
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.

1109
01:31:10,163 --> 01:31:12,472
She's off hunting down
the Forest Spirit.

1110
01:31:12,563 --> 01:31:14,474
Then someone's got
to stop her, call her back.

1111
01:31:14,563 --> 01:31:18,442
If you're all done,
I want you out of here.
The rest of you, keep digging!

1112
01:31:18,523 --> 01:31:22,118
- Wait! What about Irontown?
- That's right! It's our home!

1113
01:31:22,203 --> 01:31:24,398
What do they expect us to do,
just abandon Irontown?

1114
01:31:24,483 --> 01:31:26,872
You heard the boy!
We haven't a moment to lose.

1115
01:31:26,963 --> 01:31:30,353
- Send a message to Lady Eboshi!
- The forest is too big!

1116
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:32,798
No messenger would have
a chance of finding her!

1117
01:31:32,883 --> 01:31:34,714
Then send out a hunter!
What else are they good for?

1118
01:31:34,803 --> 01:31:38,193
Lady Eboshi
is just being used by Jigo.

1119
01:31:38,283 --> 01:31:41,832
Tell me something.
When you fought with the boars,
were there any wolves with them?

1120
01:31:41,923 --> 01:31:43,834
Did you see San,
the Wolf Girl?

1121
01:31:43,923 --> 01:31:47,438
I have no idea. It was pitch black
when the animals came at us.

1122
01:31:47,523 --> 01:31:49,354
She was there.
I saw her.

1123
01:31:49,443 --> 01:31:52,753
I was right in the front line.
I saw everything, everything.

1124
01:31:52,843 --> 01:31:54,720
- What happened?
- I'm not sure!

1125
01:31:54,803 --> 01:31:58,079
Everything started happening so fast.
It was like a nightmare.

1126
01:31:58,163 --> 01:32:00,961
Jigo's troops put us in front
as bait to lure the boars in.

1127
01:32:01,043 --> 01:32:03,603
They didn't tell us
about the land mines under our feet...

1128
01:32:03,683 --> 01:32:06,243
or the grenades
coming in on top of us.

Where's San?

- What's going on?
- No! What do you think you're doing?

1141
01:33:20,203 --> 01:33:24,640
I have got to find Lady Eboshi.
This wolf's gonna help me find her.

1142
01:33:24,723 --> 01:33:27,556
You're on their side,
aren't you, boy?

1143
01:33:27,643 --> 01:33:29,315
Stand aside!

1144
01:33:29,403 --> 01:33:31,598
What's more important
to all of you?

1145
01:33:31,683 --> 01:33:33,514
The head of the Forest Spirit
or saving your town?

1146

- Those darts are poison.

belong to Jigo.

Here. Take these. Where I'm going,
they won't be of any use.

You go with them, Yakul.

That's where we'll find Eboshi!

- Yes? Ah, have you spotted them?

Okkoto's badly wounded.

He and the Wolf Girl
are making their way to
the realm of the Forest Spirit.

01:34:58,683 --> 01:35:02,437

for his help, are they?
Keep after them,

1167

but stay out of sight or you'll
frighten the Forest Spirit away.

Yes, sir. I understand.

1169

That was boar's blood
painted on his face, wasn't it?

We have to keep moving.

- Because of you, the forest will die!

give my warriors the power to slay

And then this whole forest
will see just what you are!

1213
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:33,352
[Wolf Howling]

1214
01:38:34,883 --> 01:38:37,522
[Howling]

1215
01:38:37,603 --> 01:38:40,436
- [Howling Continues]
- Ashitaka?

1216
01:38:45,043 --> 01:38:48,479
- [Shrieking]
- Get back!

1217
01:38:48,563 --> 01:38:51,361
[Grunting]

1218
01:38:54,323 --> 01:39:00,000
I burn!
There are flames growing inside of me.

1219
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:02,472
[Screams]

1220
01:39:02,563 --> 01:39:05,441
You must fight it!
Don't let yourself become a demon!

1221
01:39:07,283 --> 01:39:10,593
Lord Okkoto!
[Groans]

1222
01:39:10,683 --> 01:39:12,321
What is it?

1223
01:39:12,403 --> 01:39:15,201
[Wolf Howling]

1224
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:17,751
- Is it San?
- She's in danger.

1225
01:39:17,843 --> 01:39:19,674
Let's go.

1226
01:39:23,043 --> 01:39:26,956

[Gasping]

1229
01:39:45,363 --> 01:39:49,276
I'm on fire.
[Grunting]

[Grunts, Screams]

1231

[Gasping]

1232
01:39:54,523 --> 01:39:58,232
No! I don't want
to become a demon!

1233
01:39:58,323 --> 01:40:00,200
Please stop, Okkoto!

1234
01:40:00,283 --> 01:40:04,196
[Roaring]

1235
01:40:10,843 --> 01:40:12,674
You're too slow! Get on!

1236
01:40:22,403 --> 01:40:26,078
- [Grunts]
- [Shouting]

1237
01:40:26,163 --> 01:40:29,519
- A wolf!
- Hey!

1238
01:40:30,563 --> 01:40:33,953
- Eboshi!
- [Grunts]

1239
01:40:35,123 --> 01:40:37,114
[Grunts]

1240
01:40:37,203 --> 01:40:39,763
[Grunts]
You keep going!

1241
01:40:39,843 --> 01:40:43,074
Eboshi!
I have something to say!

1242
01:40:43,163 --> 01:40:45,518
- Hold your fire!
- What is it you want?

1243
01:40:45,603 --> 01:40:48,481
Lord Asano's samurai
have attacked Irontown!

1244
01:40:48,563 --> 01:40:50,793
The women are outnumbered!
They can't hold them off for long!

1245
01:40:50,883 --> 01:40:53,477
Forget about
the Forest Spirit!

1246
01:40:53,563 --> 01:40:57,078
Your men are already
heading back to Irontown,
but they need you to lead them!

1247
01:40:57,163 --> 01:40:59,472
What proof is there
this isn't a lie?

1248
01:40:59,563 --> 01:41:03,317
Lie? Don't be ridiculous!
What reason do I have to lie?

1249
01:41:03,403 --> 01:41:07,282
So it's don't kill the forest gods.
Now you want us to kill samurai instead.

1250
01:41:07,363 --> 01:41:11,720
No! What I want is for the humans
and the forest to live in peace!

1251
01:41:13,723 --> 01:41:16,954
- Just whose side is he on anyway?
- Shouldn't we go back?

1252
01:41:17,043 --> 01:41:20,479
The women are on their own now.
I've done all I can for them.

1253
01:41:20,563 --> 01:41:22,997
They can take care
of themselves.

1254
01:41:24,483 --> 01:41:28,158
There's the pool.
The creature must be somewhere nearby.

1255
01:41:28,243 --> 01:41:30,996
It's the moment of truth, boys,
so keep your eyes peeled.

1256
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:33,677
Why do we need
that woman, sir?

1257
01:41:33,763 --> 01:41:37,039
When you're going to kill a god,
let someone else do your dirty work.

1258
01:41:56,363 --> 01:41:58,354
[Grunts]

1259
01:42:02,763 --> 01:42:07,234
Moro, what happened to you?
San! It's me, Ashitaka!

1260
01:42:07,323 --> 01:42:09,314
San!

1261

[Roaring]

1262
01:42:12,043 --> 01:42:15,513
- San!
- [Gasps]

Turned into a demon.

[Roaring]

1267
01:42:32,843 --> 01:42:34,879
[Man] Leave, boy.

1268
01:42:34,963 --> 01:42:39,991
Fight me and the Forest Spirit
will never come.

[Okkoto Roaring]

1270
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:45,756
Lord Okkoto, calm your fury!

1271
01:42:48,883 --> 01:42:53,399
O mighty lord, let me have the girl!
I beg of you! Please, let her go!

1272
01:42:53,483 --> 01:42:57,112
San! Are you there?
It's me! Ashitaka!

[Roaring]

- San!
- [Roaring]

1275
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:12,643
[Screams]
Kill him!

1276
01:43:14,643 --> 01:43:17,032
San!
[Grunting]

1277
01:43:17,123 --> 01:43:18,954
Stop him!
He'll ruin everything!

Oh, Ashitaka!

- San!
- Ashitaka!

1288
01:44:05,283 --> 01:44:08,639
And here I was saving
the last of my strength...

1289
01:44:08,723 --> 01:44:11,191
to bite off that damn woman's head.
But I must save San.

1290
01:44:11,283 --> 01:44:14,081
Close ranks!
Use your grenades!

1291
01:44:20,643 --> 01:44:25,080

[Roaring Continues]

1293
01:44:31,003 --> 01:44:34,234
Don't touch him.
He's no longer a god.

[Roaring]

You can't even speak,
can you?

1297
01:44:45,163 --> 01:44:49,361
Well done, men. Now, fall back
and get the wounded out of here.

1298
01:44:49,443 --> 01:44:51,320
Go on.

1299
01:44:51,403 --> 01:44:55,635
Ooh, what a revolting spectacle.

1300
01:44:55,723 --> 01:44:58,032
Hmm.

1301
01:45:01,483 --> 01:45:03,314
It's him.

Ashitaka,
can you save the girl you love?

Huh?

1313
01:46:18,323 --> 01:46:22,714
Eboshi! Your enemy's
not the Forest Spirit.

1314
01:46:22,803 --> 01:46:25,840
- But that should have killed it.
- He's a god.
It'll take more than one shot.

1315
01:46:35,043 --> 01:46:39,036
San! [Grunts]

Huh?

1321
01:47:35,163 --> 01:47:39,042
- Quick! He's starting to change.
- Now watch closely, everyone.

1322
01:47:39,123 --> 01:47:41,683
I'm going to show you
how to kill a god,

1323
01:47:41,763 --> 01:47:44,277
a god of life and death.

1324
01:47:44,363 --> 01:47:47,275
The trick is not to fear him.

1325
01:48:02,563 --> 01:48:05,316

01:51:54,003 --> 01:51:58,360
Nothing is over.
The two of us are still alive.
Now, will you help me, San?

1370
01:52:22,083 --> 01:52:25,041
[Jigo] Hey, wait!
Come back! Help us!

1371
01:52:25,123 --> 01:52:27,796
A little crisis
and they panic. Whoa!

1372
01:52:30,483 --> 01:52:33,600
Whoa! What are you doing?
This way!

1373
01:52:33,683 --> 01:52:35,833
[Screaming]

1374
01:52:35,923 --> 01:52:39,677
[Groans]
Look! The head is moving!

1375
01:52:42,163 --> 01:52:45,439
- It's calling him to us!
- [Grunting]

1376
01:53:10,763 --> 01:53:12,594
[Tapping]

1377
01:53:24,083 --> 01:53:26,153
- [Tapping Continues]
- There you go.

1378
01:53:26,243 --> 01:53:28,962
- It shouldn't jam any more.
- Thanks.

1379
01:53:29,043 --> 01:53:31,841
- It's awfully quiet.
- Asano is waiting for sunrise.

1380
01:53:31,923 --> 01:53:35,836
I wonder if that young man
ever found Lady Eboshi.

1381
01:53:35,923 --> 01:53:38,232
Don't worry about him.
He found her, all right.

1382
01:53:38,323 --> 01:53:41,281
They'll be marching
over that hill any minute now.

1383
01:53:41,363 --> 01:53:45,515
- [Snores, Yawns]
- Big dope. Don't ask me why I love him.

1384
01:53:45,603 --> 01:53:48,800
- Hey, Kohroku!
- Let him sleep, Toki, while he can.

1385
01:53:48,883 --> 01:53:50,635
- [Rumbling]
- Huh?

1386
01:53:58,883 --> 01:54:02,637
- What's that?
- I don't know, but I don't like it.

1387
01:54:13,363 --> 01:54:15,240
It's the Nightwalker!

1388
01:54:15,323 --> 01:54:18,599
[Shouting]

1389
01:54:18,683 --> 01:54:23,199
- [Shouting]
- [Crashing]

1390
01:54:25,443 --> 01:54:28,435
[Whinnying]

1391
01:54:28,523 --> 01:54:31,162
Everybody, hold your positions!

1392
01:54:31,243 --> 01:54:34,155
- Toki, it's coming right at us.
- Run! We've gotta go!

1393
01:54:34,243 --> 01:54:39,795
[Toki] No! We promised Lady Eboshi
we would defend Irontown!

1394
01:54:44,203 --> 01:54:46,239
Look! Over there!
He's come back!

1395
01:54:50,483 --> 01:54:52,314
Get everyone out!

1396
01:54:52,403 --> 01:54:55,839
The Great Spirit's head's been cut off,
and he wants it back!

1397
01:54:55,923 --> 01:54:58,483
If that black ooze touches you,
you're dead!

1398
01:54:58,563 --> 01:55:01,600
Run for the lake!
The water will slow it down!

1399
01:55:01,683 --> 01:55:05,517
Lady Eboshi and the men
are on their way from the other side.

1400
01:55:05,603 --> 01:55:09,881
I'm gonna try to return his head
before he kills us all. Hurry!

1401
01:55:09,963 --> 01:55:12,557
- What are we gonna do now?
- It'll kill us all!

1402
01:55:12,643 --> 01:55:14,759
- We'll never get out now!
- That's enough!

1403
01:55:14,843 --> 01:55:19,155
Get everyone down to the lake
and stay calm. We can carry
the sick and the wounded.

1404
01:55:23,083 --> 01:55:26,678
[Screaming]

1405
01:55:28,203 --> 01:55:33,118
- Not that way! Stop!
- [Screaming]

1406
01:55:42,003 --> 01:55:44,915
[Whimpering]

1407
01:55:45,963 --> 01:55:47,794
Oh! There it goes!

1408
01:55:52,523 --> 01:55:54,354
We're done for!

1409
01:55:54,443 --> 01:55:56,752
Once the forge burns, that's it.
That'll be the end of Irontown.

1410
01:55:56,843 --> 01:56:00,882
We're still alive, Kohroku.
We'll manage somehow. Now, let's go.

1411
01:56:18,003 --> 01:56:19,880
There they are!

1412
01:56:30,803 --> 01:56:32,475
Go!

1413
01:56:32,563 --> 01:56:34,758
Stop right there!

1414
01:56:34,843 --> 01:56:38,392
Whoa! Oh, you're both alive.
Oh, how nice.

1415
01:56:38,483 --> 01:56:41,759
I'm giving the creature back its head.
Put the box down and back away.

1416
01:56:41,843 --> 01:56:44,641
Give the head back now?
Come on, boy. Don't be silly.

1417
01:56:44,723 --> 01:56:46,873
Now, when the sun's
about to come up?

1418
01:56:46,963 --> 01:56:49,761
Look! He's a brainless,
swollen, life-sucking god of death.

1419
01:56:49,843 --> 01:56:51,834
At sunrise he'll vanish.

1420
01:56:51,923 --> 01:56:54,118
Sir, it's coming!
We've gotta get out of here!

1421
01:56:54,203 --> 01:56:56,956
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.

1422
01:56:57,043 --> 01:56:58,874
But I might
actually get it.

1423
01:56:58,963 --> 01:57:00,681
Don't force me to kill you.

1424
01:57:00,763 --> 01:57:03,072
Oh, dear, you make it sound
so very easy.

1425
01:57:03,163 --> 01:57:06,792
You really
ought to... relax!

1426
01:57:06,883 --> 01:57:11,035
- [Growls]
- [Both Grunting]

1427
01:57:11,123 --> 01:57:15,639
Get going!
[Grunting]

1428
01:57:15,723 --> 01:57:19,557
- [Groans]
- [Panting]

1429
01:57:23,243 --> 01:57:25,677
[Whimpering]

1430
01:57:25,763 --> 01:57:28,721
- [Whimpering]
- Oh!

1431
01:57:30,363 --> 01:57:32,923
Ashitaka!

1432
01:57:33,003 --> 01:57:35,119
I got it! Whoa! Ooh!

1433
01:57:35,203 --> 01:57:39,833
Everything's... Oof!
Under control! Oof!

1434
01:57:39,923 --> 01:57:41,754
This is bad.

1435
01:57:44,283 --> 01:57:46,399
Master, we're surrounded!
[Screams]

1436
01:57:46,483 --> 01:57:49,520
- Come on, sun! Rise!
- Open the box!

1437
01:57:49,603 --> 01:57:51,639
Don't you see?
It's too late for that now!

1438
01:57:51,723 --> 01:57:54,396
Why are you wasting
your breath talking to him?

1439
01:57:54,483 --> 01:57:58,158
- Human hands must return it!
- [Groans]

1440
01:57:58,243 --> 01:58:02,395
[Grunts]
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1441
01:58:10,603 --> 01:58:13,401
[Gasps]

1442
01:58:13,483 --> 01:58:15,792
Forest Spirit!

1443
01:58:15,883 --> 01:58:18,955
We give you back your head!

1444
01:58:19,043 --> 01:58:21,955
Take it and be at peace!

1445
01:58:29,803 --> 01:58:32,601
Uh, well, that got
his attention, all right.

1446
01:58:44,443 --> 01:58:46,718
[Gasping]

1447
01:59:01,363 --> 01:59:03,194
Well, I think it's over.

1448
01:59:03,283 --> 01:59:04,955
- [Man] Hello!
- It's the men.

1449
01:59:05,043 --> 01:59:07,557
- [Shouting]
- The men! The men are back!

1450
01:59:07,643 --> 01:59:11,272
I really can't believe we made it.
I never thought I'd live
to see home again.

1451
01:59:11,363 --> 01:59:15,197
[Wind Howling]

1452
01:59:17,483 --> 01:59:20,759
- Milady! You're here!
- Her ladyship has been injured.

1453
01:59:47,563 --> 01:59:50,077
Look! It's falling on Irontown!

1454
01:59:55,403 --> 01:59:57,712
[Toki] Hang on tight, everybody!
Don't let go!

1455
02:01:01,243 --> 02:01:05,475
Huh? I didn't know the Forest Spirit
made the flowers grow.

1456
02:01:30,803 --> 02:01:32,634
[Moans]

1457
02:01:34,363 --> 02:01:37,355
[Gasps] San. San, look.

1458
02:02:06,243 --> 02:02:09,519
Even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest any more.

1459
02:02:09,603 --> 02:02:12,037
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.

1460
02:02:12,123 --> 02:02:15,752
Never. He's life itself.
He's not dead, San.

1461
02:02:15,843 --> 02:02:18,721
He's here right now,
trying to tell us something,

1462
02:02:18,803 --> 02:02:20,680
that it's time
for us both to live.

1463
02:02:28,403 --> 02:02:30,280
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me,

1464
02:02:30,363 --> 02:02:32,718
but I can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.

1465
02:02:32,803 --> 02:02:36,478
I understand. You'll live in the forest,
and I'll go help them rebuild Irontown.

1466
02:02:36,563 --> 02:02:40,636
I'll always be near.
Yakul and I will come and visit you...

1467
02:02:40,723 --> 02:02:42,953
whenever we can, all right?

1468
02:02:52,883 --> 02:02:57,593
Amazing. The wolves and
that crazy little Wolf Girl
helped save us all.

1469
02:02:57,683 --> 02:03:01,517
Ashitaka. Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.

1470
02:03:01,603 --> 02:03:05,721
We're going to start all over again.
This time we'll build a better town.

1471
02:03:05,803 --> 02:03:09,796
Well, I give up.
You can't win against fools.

1472
02:03:25,523 --> 02:03:27,354
[Clicking]

1473
02:03:35,283 --> 02:03:40,403
In the moonlight
I felt your heart

1474
02:03:40,483 --> 02:03:45,477
Quiver like
a bowstring's pulse

1475
02:03:45,563 --> 02:03:51,593
In the moon's mere light
you looked at me

1476
02:03:51,683 --> 02:03:57,235
Nobody knows your heart

1477
02:03:57,323 --> 02:04:02,681
When the sun has gone
I see you

1478
02:04:02,763 --> 02:04:07,553
Beautiful and haunting
but cold

1479
02:04:07,643 --> 02:04:13,673
Like the blade of a knife
so sharp, so sweet

1480
02:04:13,763 --> 02:04:19,235
Nobody knows your heart

1481
02:04:19,323 --> 02:04:24,795
All of your sorrow
grief and pain

1482
02:04:24,883 --> 02:04:30,162
Locked away
in the forest of the night

1483
02:04:30,243 --> 02:04:36,637
Your secret heart
belongs to the world

1484
02:04:36,723 --> 02:04:42,161
Of the things
that sigh in the dark

1485
02:04:42,243 --> 02:04:49,354
Or the things
that cry in the dark
