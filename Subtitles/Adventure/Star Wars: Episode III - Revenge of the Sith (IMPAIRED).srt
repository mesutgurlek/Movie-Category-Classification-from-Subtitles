Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

324
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:44,222
We can go to the lake country

325
00:29:44,305 --> 00:29:46,224
where we can be safe.

326
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:50,769
I can go early and fix up the baby’s room.

327
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:58,068
I know the perfect spot. Right by the gardens.

You are so... beautiful.

329
00:30:07,243 --> 00:30:09,286
It’s only because I’m so in love.

No.
[CHUCKLES]

331

No, it’s because I’m so in love with you.

- So love has blinded you?

How long is it gonna take

Bad?

346
00:32:02,356 --> 00:32:04,816
Like the ones I used to have

It was only a dream.

I won’t let this one become real.

This baby will change our lives.

I doubt the queen will continue to allow me
to serve in the senate.

And if the council discovers
you’re the father, you’ll be expelled–

I– I know. I know.

Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

Someone.

00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,879
Close to you?

371
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:57,299
Yes.

372
00:33:57,382 --> 00:34:01,261
Careful you must be
when sensing the future, Anakin.

373
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:05,682
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

374
00:34:07,893 --> 00:34:11,188
I won’t let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

<i>Death is a natural part of life.

Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

378
00:34:22,741 --> 00:34:25,869
Attachment leads to jealousy.

379
00:34:25,952 --> 00:34:29,414
The shadow of greed that is.

00:34:29,498 --> 00:34:32,334
What must I do, Master Yoda?

381
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:35,504
Train yourself to let go...

382
00:34:35,587 --> 00:34:39,049
of everything you fear to lose.

383
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:52,187
OBI-WAN: You’ve missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

384
00:34:53,605 --> 00:34:55,982
I’m sorry. I was held up.

385
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:59,694
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

386
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:05,200
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

387
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:07,327
What’s wrong, then?

388
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:10,037
The senate is expected...

389
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,624
to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.

390
00:35:13,707 --> 00:35:18,087
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

391
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,631
It’ll make it easier for us to end this war.

392
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:24,677
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

393
00:35:26,303 --> 00:35:28,179
Be careful of what?

394
00:35:28,304 --> 00:35:30,932
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

395
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:35,687
- He would not say.
- He didn’t inform the council?

396
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:39,274
- That’s unusual, isn’t it?
- All ofthis is unusual.

397
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:41,818
And it’s making me feel uneasy.

398
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,710
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

399
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:00,962
Of course.

400
00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:04,007
I need your help, son.

401
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:07,135
What do you mean?

402
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,473
- I’m depending on you.
- For what? I don’t understand.

403
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:18,146
To be the eyes, ears
and voice ofthe Republic.

404
00:36:18,229 --> 00:36:20,398
Anakin,

405
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:24,652
I’m appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

406
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:28,031
Me? A master?

407
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:31,533
I’m overwhelmed, sir.

408
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:36,537
But the council elects its own members.
They’ll never accept this.

409
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:40,124
I think they will. They need you.

410
00:36:40,207 --> 00:36:42,668
More than you know.

411
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:58,142
YODA: Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

412
00:36:58,225 --> 00:37:01,687
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

413
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:04,439
I understand.

414
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:09,611
You are on this council,
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

415
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,738
What?

416
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:20,205
<i>How can you do this? This is outrageous.

417
00:37:20,288 --> 00:37:22,457
<i>It’s unfair.

418
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:27,087
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

419
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:30,715
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

420
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,054
Forgive me, Master.

421
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:42,060

423
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:48,774
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:51,985
The outlying systems you must sweep.

425
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,321
We do not have many ships to spare.

426
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,614
<i>What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?

427
00:37:56,698 --> 00:38:00,410
<i>It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

428
00:38:00,493 --> 00:38:03,955
He’s right. It’s a system
we cannot afford to lose.

429
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:07,374
Go I will.

430
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:10,502
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

431
00:38:10,585 --> 00:38:14,923
It’s settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion of clones...

432
00:38:15,006 --> 00:38:17,342
<i>to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

433

May the Force be with us all.

434
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:24,391
ANAKIN:
What kind of nonsense is this?

435
00:38:24,474 --> 00:38:26,893
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

436
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:29,730
It’s never been done
in the history of the Jedi. It’s insulting.

437
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:32,733
Oh, calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

438
00:38:32,816 --> 00:38:36,862
To be on the council at your age–
it’s never happened before.

439
00:38:36,945 --> 00:38:40,365
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

440
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:44,202
The council doesn’t like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

441
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:50,083
- I swear to you, I didn’t ask
to be put on the council.
- But it’s what you wanted.

442
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:53,503
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.

443
00:38:53,587 --> 00:38:55,505
That has nothing to do with this.

444
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:58,550
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

445
00:38:58,633 --> 00:39:01,594
is because the chancellor trusts you.

446
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:04,722
- And?
- Anakin, I am on your side.

447
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:08,184
- I didn’t want to put you
in this situation.
- What situation?

448
00:39:12,229 --> 00:39:16,609
The council wants you to report
on all the chancellor’s dealings.

449
00:39:16,692 --> 00:39:19,069
They want to know what he’s up to.

450
00:39:23,574 --> 00:39:26,410
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

451
00:39:26,535 --> 00:39:29,205
- But that’s treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

452
00:39:31,207 --> 00:39:34,168
Why didn’t the council give me this assignment
when we were in session?

453
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:36,712
This assignment is not to be on record.

454
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:40,757
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

455
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,885
He befriended me. He’s watched out for me
ever since I arrived here.

456
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:46,095
That is why you must help us.

457
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:49,682
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate,
not to its leader,

458
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:53,478
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

459
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:55,563
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

460
00:39:55,647 --> 00:39:58,816
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

461
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:03,487
[SIGHS] You’re asking me
to do something against the Jedi code,

462
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,323
against the Republic,
against a mentor and a friend.

463
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:11,244
That’s what’s out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

464
00:40:13,538 --> 00:40:15,456
The council is asking you.

465
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,176
Anakin did not take to his new assignment
with much enthusiasm.

466
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,471
<i>WINDU:
It’s very dangerous, putting them together

468
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:35,518
I don’t trust him.

469
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:39,480
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

470
00:40:39,564 --> 00:40:43,276
Is he not to destroy the Sith
