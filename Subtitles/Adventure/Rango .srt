1
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:20,037
We are gathered here today
to immortalise in song

2
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:23,624
the life and untimely death
of a great legend.

3
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,043
- Rango.
- So sit back, relax,

4
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,047
and enjoy your low-calorie popcorn
and assorted confections

5
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:34,969
while we tell you the strange
and bewildering tale of a hero

6
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,514
who has yet to enter his own story.

7
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,907
Crunchy, creamy, cookie,
candy, cupcake.

8
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,410
Okay, everybody,
let's take it from the top.

9
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,248
The stage is set,
the night moist with apprehension.

10
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:08,336
Alone in her chamber, the princess
prepares to take her own life.

11
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,924
"lt is far better to nourish worms
than to live without love."

12
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,926
She reaches for the poisoned chalice.

13
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,387
Meanwhile, the wicked Malvolio
plots his ascension to the throne

14
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,890
while her ageing father lies gravely ill.

15
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,559
"Yes, l am gravely ill."

16
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,896
"Hark, who goes there?"

17
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,524
'Tis l, the much-anticipated hero,

18
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,276
returning to rescue
his emotionally unstable maiden!

19
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,445
Unhand her, you jailers of virtue,

20
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,406
or taste the bitter sting
of my vengeance!

21
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,409
The sting of my...

22
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,288
Dr Marx?

23
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,041
Dr Marx,
l'm not getting anything from you.

24
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,045
People, we've talked about this.
Acting is reacting.

25
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,631
Victor, you were wooden!
There, l said it.

26
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,591
Mr Timms? You were good.

27
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,761
Perhaps a little too good.

28
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:03,057
What's that, Victor? My character's
undefined? That's absurd.

29
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:08,145
l know who l am.
l'm the guy, the protagonist, the hero.

30
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:12,233
Every story needs a hero.
l mean, who else is better qualified

31
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,987
to bask in the adulation
of his numerous companions?

32
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,841
The stage is waiting.

33
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:40,011
The audience thirsts for adventure.

34
00:03:42,306 --> 00:03:43,848
Who am I?

35
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,434
I couId be anyone.

36
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:51,355
l could be the sea cap'n
returning from a mighty voyage

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,649
to reclaim his mechanical arm!

38
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:59,280
Or l could be the rogue anthropologist,
battling pythons down in the Congo!

39
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,115
Down, Chongo, down!

40
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,118
And if you desire romance,

41
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,706
l will become the greatest lover
the world has ever known!

42
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:19,800
l couldn't help but notice you
noticing me noticing you.

43
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:23,638
You know, the womens find me
uncomfortably good looking.

44
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,182
But you seem remarkably at ease.

45
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,476
Stop it. No, really.

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,978
Well, if you must. What are you doing?

47
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,064
That tickles. Are those real?

48
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,317
That's it! Conflict.

49
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,986
Victor, you were right.
l have been undefined.

50
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,200
People, l've had an epiphany.
The hero cannot exist in a vacuum!

51
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,411
What our story needs is an ironic,
unexpected event

52
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:50,247
that will propel the hero into conflict!

53
00:05:46,805 --> 00:06:09,410
Mr Timms?

54
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,099
That's right! You!

55
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,478
Don't be shy. Come on.

56
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,688
lt's okay.

57
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,774
That's it, a little closer.

58
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,443
Good.

59
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,737
l won't bite you.

60
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,866
l need a little help here.

61
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,743
Are you okay?

62
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,871
l must get to the other side.

63
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,749
The other side? You mean, just now,
that was you crossing the road?

64
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,125
That's why the...

65
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,544
Why'd you do that?

66
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,756
This is my quest. He waits for me.

67
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,216
What? Who?

68
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,886
The Spirit of the West, amigo. The one.

69
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,349
They say he rides an alabaster carriage
with golden guardians to protect him.

70
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,226
What are you talking about?

71
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,687
Enlightenment.
We are nothing without it.

72
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,399
Nothing? Your delusional quest
just ruined my life!

73
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,944
l had an incredibly complex
social network going!

74
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,905
Highly sophisticated friends!
l was very popular!

75
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,115
Friends? l don't see no friends.

76
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,703
You are a very lonely lizard.

77
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,916
Look, l need water, hydration.
My teeth are chapped.

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,168
l need lotion.
l'm down to one layer of skin already.

79
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,003
Pretty soon,
l'm going to start seeing my insides.

80
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,714
Not unlike what you've got going there.

81
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,633
Listen, l can't survive
in the desert, okay?

82
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,635
l... l don't belong here.

83
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,013
That may be true, but here you are.

84
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:58,561
Now help me up
and l will help you find what you seek.

85
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,146
- You will?
- And perhaps more.

86
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,274
Quickly. l must get back to my quest.

87
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:07,027
- You mean you've done this before?
- Yes. Many times.

88
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,614
Come, come. That's it, pull my finger.

89
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,700
The Spirit is waiting for me.

90
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,535
Okay, okay.

91
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,251
Okay. That's not going to work.

92
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,295
l must get to the other side.

93
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,881
Why don't you just wait
until there are no cars coming?

94
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,633
lt's not so easy as it looks.

95
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:30,759
What?

96
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,261
ls a metaphor.

97
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,001
There's another one!

98
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,920
l knew it.

99
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,267
You need a little help, amigo?

100
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,437
l think the metaphor broke my spleen.

101
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,106
The path to knowledge
is fraught with consequence.

102
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:29,026
l'm just looking for the path to water.

103
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,822
lf you want to find water,
you must first find Dirt.

104
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,325
Dirt.

105
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,536
Destiny, she is kind to you.

106
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,539
Tomorrow is Wednesday.
The water comes.

107
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,169
At noon, the townspeople gather
for a mysterious ritual.

108
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,132
A town? You mean, with real people
and everything? Where?

109
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,052
A day's journey. Follow your shadow.

110
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,307
You want me to just walk out
into the desert?

111
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,475
That's the way.

112
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,977
Okay. So you're saying

113
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,648
there's a town, a real town,
not a metaphor town.

114
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,233
Go on. lt's okay.

115
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,901
Okay.

116
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,986
Well, then, l'm going.

117
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,407
l am leaving the road now!

118
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,993
l'm walking into the desert!

119
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,745
Alone!

120
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,415
We all have ourjourneys to make!

121
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,751
l will see you on the other side.

122
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,018
Welcome, amigo

123
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,105
To the Iand without end

124
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,358
The desert and death

125
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,362
Are the cIosest of friends

126
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,365
We sing of his courage

127
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,702
In magnificent song

128
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,621
But pay cIose attention

129
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,624
He won't be here Iong

130
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,048
As the birds pIuck his eyes
The sun bIeaches his bones

131
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:20,137
See his entraiIs get scattered
Watch him Iose his cojones

132
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,062
Here in the Mojave Desert,

133
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:34,401
animals have had millions of years
to adapt to the harsh environment.

134
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,738
But the lizard? He is going to die.

135
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,492
"Four score and seven years ago,
our fathers..."

136
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,660
- Don't move.
- What?

137
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,585
- Don't move!
- Not moving.

138
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,753
Not moving.

139
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,005
Try to blend in.

140
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,673
Blend in? What do you mean?

141
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,678
Blend in.

142
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,514
What are you saying?

143
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,934
- Too late.
- No, no. lt's not too late!

144
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,269
l'm blending! l'm a blender!

145
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,480
Hey, calm down! What are you doing?

146
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,901
Stop moving!

147
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,237
Try not to look conspicuous.

148
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,289
- What are you doing?
- l'm blending.

149
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,208
- Go blend somewhere else.
- Don't distract me.

150
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,126
- No room at the inn.
- lt's an art, not a science.

151
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,170
- Find your own hiding place.
- No, this is good.

152
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,965
Here she comes! You better run, Mojito!

153
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,844
- What? l thought you said, "Don't move."
- That was before. Now, you run.

154
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,226
Oh, hey. Proboscis.

155
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:32,936
Testy.

156
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:49,786
Please, no, please. l have vertigo!
My glands are swelling!

157
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,456
Please, no.

158
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,426
You! l'll kill you! You stupid lizard!

159
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,428
Get out of there.
l'm going to strangle your huevos!

160
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,305
Big bird! Big bird!

161
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,892
No, wait! Come back! l was just kidding!

162
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,894
- Come on, we're friends, right?
- l don't know you!

163
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,771
- Lizards, frogs...
- Find your own hiding place!

164
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,522
- We're practically related!
- No room at the inn!

165
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,024
- Come on, move over!
- You're not my friend!

166
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,234
l'll let you kiss my sister!

167
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,870
You son of a...

168
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,845
Where are your friends now, amigo?

169
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,168
Get your slimy-webbed phalanges
off my boots!

170
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,295
Sorry.

171
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,631
l got a bead on you, stranger.
So you get up real slow

172
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,175
lessen you want to spend the better part

173
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,135
of the afternoon
putting your face back together!

174
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,929
- No, ma'am, l don't.
- Who are you?

175
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,348
- Who am l?
- l'm asking the questions here!

176
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,893
Our town is drying up.
We're in the middle of a drought.

177
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,728
Now someone's dumping water
in the desert!

178
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,938
lt's a puzzle of undeterminable size
and dimension,

179
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,858
but l intend to find out
what role you playing in all this.

180
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,569
- Role?
- What are you involved in?

181
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,197
Well, l'm glad you asked.

182
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,408
l've got two one-acts, a mystery
and a musical l've been gestating.

183
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,620
l got the words, l'm just working on
the melody right now. lt's like a...

184
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,040
l think it's gonna be a western.

185
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,751
A monkey got a cracker
His mother was a sIapper

186
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,463
She'II be coming 'round the mountain
in the rain

187
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,634
You ain't from around here, are you?

188
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,970
l'm still working on it.

189
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,890
So, what's your name?

190
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,518
- Beans.
- That's a funny kind of name.

191
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,562
What can l say?
My daddy plumb loved baked beans.

192
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:04,397
Well, you're lucky
he didn't plumb love asparagus.

193
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,690
What are you saying?

194
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,859
l mean,
l enjoy a hearty puttanesca myself,

195
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,237
but l'm not sure that a child
would appreciate the moniker.

196
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:14,950
My daddy was a great man, even if
he did exhibit a proclivity for legumes.

197
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,577
- Spicy.
- You're eating his ashes!

198
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,122
You carry his remains?

199
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,500
No, his ashes. He loved to smoke.
They never found the body.

200
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,585
Well, l'm sure he had his reasons.

201
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,671
- What are you implying?
- Nothing.

202
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,756
My daddy was never near
that mine shaft.

203
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,424
He'd been sober for over a month!

204
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,469
And for you to insinuate that he would
abandon his parental responsibilities

205
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,515
at a delicate time in my personal
development is an affront to my sense...

206
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,562
Miss Beans?

207
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,815
Miss Beans? Hello?

208
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,860
Hello?

209
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,003
And until the people ofAndromeda Five

210
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,256
return him safe and sound,
l will not sell my ranch!

211
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,968
- What... What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

212
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,928
- What am l doing?
- You're cuddling me.

213
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,430
- You were frozen.
- l was not.

214
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,432
Yes, you were. You stopped talking.

215
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,810
lt's a defence mechanism.
Actually, lots of lizards have it.

216
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,103
You're making that up.

217
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,148
So, you gonna die out here,
or you want a ride into town?

218
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:32,194
No, no, no. Yeah. No. Yes, please.
Thank you. Sorry.

219
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:36,031
Today's Wednesday.
Wednesday's when we all get to it.

220
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,241
So who are you, really?

221
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,076
Well, l'm a man of many epithets.

222
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,537
There's my stage name, my pen name,
my avatar.

223
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,165
l had a pseudonym once,
but l had it legally changed.

224
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,252
And so the stranger,
seeking companionship,

225
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:53,673
finds the woman,
much like the sirens of ancient times

226
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:58,053
luring him to his certain demise.

227
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,430
...nom de plume, l have a CB handle.

228
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,224
l'm actually one of the few men
with a maiden name.

229
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,976
Whoa! Well, here we are.

230
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,485
Right.

231
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,154
Well, l sure do appreciate this,
Miss Beans,

232
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,990
- and if there's ever anything that l...
- Get on up!

233
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,117
Okay, then!

234
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,620
See you, Beans.

235
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,429
You heading out, Jim?

236
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,641
Well, we gave it our best shot.
We had to sell out.

237
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,602
Can't grow no crops without no water.

238
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,689
Bye, now!

239
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,945
What is it?

240
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,283
What was that for?

241
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,076
You're funny looking.

242
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,829
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're funny looking, too.

243
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,290
- That's a funny-looking shirt.
- That's a funny-looking dress.

244
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,792
- You got funny-looking eyes!
- You got a funny-looking face!

245
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,839
You're a stranger.
Strangers don't last long here.

246
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,341
Here's your beans, Beans.

247
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,468
l'm gonna need some more feed, too,
Willie.

248
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,597
Now, Beans, you owe me three quarts
already. l can't give you more credit.

249
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,975
But l'll have what l owe you at noon.

250
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:32,314
You don't understand. lt's Mr Merrimack
down at the bank. He cut off all credit.

251
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,607
Hey, Beans! Beans!

252
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,818
You know that there fella?

253
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,445
Hey, Beans! Miss Beans!

254
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,488
Nope.

255
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,781
Hey, Beans!

256
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,033
Hey.

257
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,787
Right. Blend in. Yeah, blend in.

258
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,797
l'd like a glass of water.

259
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:25,218
He wants a glass of water!

260
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,595
Make it a double!

261
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,055
Give him the spittoon!

262
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:37,689
Cactus juice. That's what we got.

263
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,256
Hey, there, fruit cup.

264
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,385
You're a long ways from home, ain't ya?

265
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,013
Who exactly are you?

266
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,685
Who am I?

267
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,521
I couId be anyone.

268
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,571
What's the matter?
You missing your mommy's mangos?

269
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,866
As a matter of fact, l am.

270
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,869
But not as much as
your daddy's cooking!

271
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,291
Exactly where did you say
you were from?

272
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,711
Me? l'm from the West.

273
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:45,048
Out there, beyond the horizon.
Past the sunset.

274
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,717
The Far West.

275
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,387
Yeah, that's right, hombres.

276
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:54,224
The place l come from,
we kill a man before breakfast

277
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,476
just to work up an appetite.

278
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,270
Then we salt him, and we pepper him.

279
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:03,525
Then we braise him in clarified butter.
And then we eat him.

280
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,652
- You eat him?
- That's what l said!

281
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:09,864
Hell, l seen things make a grown man
lose control of his glandular functions!

282
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,159
You spend three days in a horse
carcass, living off your own juices.

283
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:16,120
lt'll change a man. Oh, yeah.

284
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:23,086
Had a few extra aces in this deck,
gents. Just the way l like it.

285
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,091
So, no, my hirsute little rodent friend,
l am not from around these parts.

286
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,510
You might say l'm from everywhere
there's trouble brewing

287
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,887
and hell waiting to be raised.

288
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,432
You might say
l'm what hell's already raised up.

289
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,269
Name's

290
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:44,274
Rango.

291
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,111
Are you the fella
that killed them Jenkins brothers?

292
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,573
Killed them with one bullet.

293
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,449
Don't get no deader.

294
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,618
All seven of them?

295
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,121
That's right.

296
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,456
All seven of them.

297
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,669
Exactly how you do that, Mr Rango?

298
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,048
You know, l'm glad you asked me that.

299
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:13,136
And l will be happy to tell you how.
But you're all gonna have to listen up!

300
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,639
Because this is where it gets

301
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,017
complicated.

302
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,022
That'll close out your account,
Mrs Oats, two gulps and a swig.

303
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,400
Hands off, Mordecai! That's what's left
of your college education!

304
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,071
l don't rightly have
no other choice, Beans.

305
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:36,326
Times being so hard,
we just can't give no more credit.

306
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,662
But this here is a bank.
This is where you keep the water.

307
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:47,170
Beans, you've been like a niece to me
ever since your daddy

308
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,216
did not fall drunk down a mine shaft.

309
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:56,846
l've tried to protect you and others
from certain realities.

310
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,931
But that... Well...

311
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,225
- Mr Merrimack?
- Realities are bearing down.

312
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,852
Mr Merrimack!

313
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,896
Are you all right?

314
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:09,025
Beans, l need to show you something.

315
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,203
- That's all that's left?
- And this here is the reserve!

316
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,954
l don't know if you've noticed,

317
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,541
but folks just ain't making deposits
on a Wednesday no more!

318
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:29,087
Mr Merrimack, if l don't get some water,
l'm gonna lose my ranch

319
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,547
and you're telling me
that's all that's left in the whole town?

320
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,801
Now that just don't make no sense.
Now, listen.

321
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:38,888
Someone is dumping water
in the desert.

322
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,308
l seen it with my own eyes.

323
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,020
Water in the desert?

324
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:49,148
Was this during
one of your special times?

325
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,483
No.

326
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:54,654
Well, we can all dream,
but this is the reality.

327
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,366
Why do you think so many people
are selling out? They just can't make it.

328
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,910
Well, what am l supposed to do?

329
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,038
Well, l suppose
we could talk to the Mayor.

330
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,291
l hear he's been helping people out
in this time of crisis.

331
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,501
The Mayor?

332
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,295
He may be our only hope.

333
00:27:11,422 --> 00:27:14,340
Bullet hits a shovel, ricochets back
towards number three,

334
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,800
and that's when the roof caved in,

335
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:18,010
igniting the thermos
of pure grain alcohol

336
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:21,931
instantly vapourising his bodily form,
leaving nothing but a charcoal statue

337
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,142
and a high-pitched squeal.

338
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,860
Hold on, there. That's only six.
What happened to number seven?

339
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,446
Number seven?

340
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,865
Hell, he died of infection.

341
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,162
- Seven men!
- One bullet!

342
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,289
Drinks all around!

343
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,169
Dance for me, Sod Buster!

344
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,005
- Yes, dance like a chicken!
- That's right! Dance!

345
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,633
You got corn in your ears, mate?

346
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,678
You don't pay the mortgage,
you don't own the land!

347
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,848
- That's basic real estate law, my friend.
- Quid pro quo!

348
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:07,018
lf l see your face in this town again,

349
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:11,522
l'm gonna slice it off and use it
to wipe my unmentionables.

350
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,399
Mind the beak.

351
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,153
And don't come back!

352
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,699
What are you all gawping at?

353
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,831
Hey, Bad Bill,
there's something l got to tell you!

354
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,712
What is this?

355
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,841
You know who that is, Bill?
That there's Rango!

356
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:42,762
Yeah, he ain't afraid of you!
He ain't afraid of none of you.

357
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,305
Killed them Jenkins brothers.

358
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,350
- Done it with one bullet, Bill.
- All seven of them!

359
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:49,894
ls that right?

360
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,892
Let me get that before you...

361
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,065
No. Oh, l know. Here.

362
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,446
Just take care of that for you.

363
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,449
There. All better.

364
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,435
T.O. T.O. Just a second.

365
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,147
All right, now listen!

366
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,483
l'm going to give you fellas
one last chance to reconsider!

367
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,241
And if you don't want to reconsider

368
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,453
l might consider reconsidering myself.

369
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,176
Now that's what l'm talking about. Yeah.

370
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,886
All right, now listen up!

371
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,014
Things are going to be different
around here now that Rango's in town.

372
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,184
Got some new rules!
l want my shoes shined every morning,

373
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,186
my coffee hot, Danish on the side.

374
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,521
Whatever you do,
don't look me in the eye.

375
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,107
Stay out of my peripheral vision!

376
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,151
- lt's Rango.
- What's he up to?

377
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,404
He ain't afraid of nobody.
He's telling that bird what's for!

378
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,323
And when you see me coming,
stand aside.

379
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,368
l take large steps and l don't want
none of you hayseeds

380
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:13,162
getting your bodily fluids on my boots!

381
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,833
Of course, there is no need for violence,

382
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,878
as long as we stick together,
work as a team.

383
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:24,382
So l want you all to come outside now
and line up single file

384
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:25,967
while l take a brief intermission!

385
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,638
What's he doing now?

386
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,348
l think it's a number two.

387
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,871
Never mind.

388
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,477
Take a look-see over here!

389
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:19,812
Well, look at him now!

390
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,772
He's chasing after that hawk!

391
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:52,887
Give him hell, Rango!

392
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,099
- Did you see that?
- He killed that thing!

393
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,851
What do you think, Doc?

394
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,312
This hawk is dead!

395
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,357
Shoot, l say we cook that right up.

396
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,150
He did it with one bullet!

397
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,777
Just like he said!

398
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,612
lt's about time
we had a hero around here.

399
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,990
One who ain't in a pine box.

400
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,493
l think it's time he met the Mayor.

401
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,538
You hear that, Rango?
You're going to meet the Mayor!

402
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,999
Let's hear it for Rango!

403
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,754
And so the stranger basks

404
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:54,216
in the adulation of his new friends,

405
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:59,513
sinking deeper into the guacamole
of his own deception.

406
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,265
When is he going to die?

407
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,851
Soon, compadre. Soon.

408
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,411
My land is not for sale!

409
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,081
l came here to save my land, not sell it!

410
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:29,877
l'm sure there's something reasonable
we can work out if you just talk to him!

411
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,047
Beans! Where are you going? Beans?

412
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,424
The Mayor will see you now.

413
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,141
Water, Mr Rango, water.

414
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,937
Without it,
there's nothing but dust and decay.

415
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:52,566
But with water there's life.

416
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:59,448
Look at them, so desperate to live,
they'll follow it anywhere.

417
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,201
That's the immutable law of the desert.

418
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,332
Control the water
and you control everything.

419
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:12,920
But l don't have to tell you that being
a true man of the West, as you are.

420
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,424
Oh, yeah. The West is the best.

421
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,760
This is from my private stock.

422
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,972
Vintage rainwater
from the Great Deluge.

423
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,559
Not Noah's deluge.
Good heavens, l'm not that old.

424
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,690
l guess power has its privileges.

425
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,775
You make a good point, son.

426
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:38,862
But with privilege comes responsibility.

427
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,450
Hell, l was mayor here
before there was a Dirt!

428
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,870
And l may be
just a sentimental old turtle

429
00:36:46,997 --> 00:36:52,001
but l think there's a future for this town.
And l hope you'll be part of it.

430
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,630
- To Dirt!
- To Dirt.

431
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:03,178
You see them, Mr Rango?
All my friends and neighbours?

432
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,516
lt's a hard life here. Very hard.

433
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:12,021
Do you know how they make it through
each and every day?

434
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,188
They believe.

435
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,692
They believe it's going to be better.

436
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:20,154
They believe that the water will come.

437
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,740
They believe against all odds
and all evidence

438
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,034
that tomorrow will be better than today.

439
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,663
People have to believe in something.

440
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,584
Right now, they believe in you.

441
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:40,049
Pick it up, Mr Rango.
Your destiny awaits.

442
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:47,014
People have to believe in something.

443
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,647
lt's almost noon. ls everything ready?

444
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,567
Yeah. But he might be a problem.

445
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,071
He's not a problem, William.
He's a solution.

446
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,742
lt just don't make no sense.

447
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,410
This whole town is drying up,

448
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,079
and the Mayor is the only one
who don't seem to be affected.

449
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,207
Doesn't that make you
just a wee bit suspicious?

450
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,502
And what about that water
l saw out in the desert?

451
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:20,923
All right! No need to incite anxiety.
l'll inquire about the Mayor.

452
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:24,760
But if you really feel
there's some conspiracy occurring,

453
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,888
l suggest you take it up
with the new sheriff.

454
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:32,226
This is going to be good. Hey!
Watch that needle there.

455
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,269
Not too tight.
l want to leave room for some pucker!

456
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:35,395
That's good.

457
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,022
Oh, easy there, tiger.

458
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,690
- A little up and back?
- l don't think so.

459
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:39,817
Have you got French cuffs with that?

460
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,568
Excuse me, Sheriff Rango.
l want to talk to you.

461
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,153
Hey, Beans,
what do you think of the new duds?

462
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,239
l got a 1 0-gallon hat
marked down from 15.

463
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,907
- That's nice.
- Have you met Angelique?

464
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,826
- Hello, Beans.
- Hello, Angelique.

465
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,952
- Tart.
- Floozy.

466
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,246
- Trollop.
- Excuse me, Mr Rango.

467
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,956
l will blow that ugly right off your face!

468
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,250
l was just thinking that...

469
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,710
You want the old John Hancock,
do you?

470
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,921
- Well, here. Hold this.
- Sheriff Rango, this isn't a social call.

471
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,714
There's a bullet in there.

472
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,341
l know about the shindig this afternoon.

473
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,927
- l ordered myself some right fancy duds.
- Sheriff, l'd like to file a...

474
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,762
- Mr Rango!
- Oh, you, too? No problem.

475
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,472
- Here, let me just...
- l need you to investigate...

476
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,433
You know, Beans, l bet you clean up
real nice, you put a little effort into it.

477
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,726
- What?
- Now, remember, son,

478
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,354
stay in school, eat your veggies,
burn everything but Shakespeare.

479
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,064
- Who's Shakespeare?
- Sheriff Rango,

480
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,275
if that is your real name.

481
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,569
l am trying to save my daddy's ranch,

482
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,737
which is on the verge
of an agricultural meltdown

483
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:28,740
while you're playing patty-cake
with this here trollop!

484
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,288
Sad, really. Such a drab little thing.

485
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,123
Why does she do that?

486
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,459
- lt's a survival reflex.
- Her switch is just broken.

487
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,003
Well, that's an inconvenience.

488
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,714
lt is not a rash! lt is a birthmark!

489
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,675
l did it again, didn't l?

490
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,010
Did what?

491
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,970
Let me ask you something.

492
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,141
Did anybody here mention
what happened to our last sheriff?

493
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:37,851
Pardon, but may l ask you...
Excuse me, may l ask you...

494
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:41,772
The last sheriff... Pardon me.
Where is everybody going?

495
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:45,275
What exactly happened to the...

496
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,198
AII day

497
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:55,285
I've faced the barren waste

498
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:59,665
Without the taste of water

499
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,047
CooI water

500
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:13,303
OId Dan and I

501
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,389
With throats burned dry

502
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:20,143
And souIs that cry

503
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,813
For water

504
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,192
CooI

505
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,570
l'm so sorry. l'm so sorry.

506
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:33,115
CIear water

507
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,874
This is a heck of a hoedown
you got going.

508
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,751
Still working out those steps.

509
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,714
So, is this considered
normal civic behaviour?

510
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:51,299
Every Wednesday, just like clockwork.

511
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,135
You kill bird.

512
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,096
Yeah. Matter of fact, l did.

513
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,724
Bird dead. Snake come.

514
00:41:58,975 --> 00:41:59,975
Snake?

515
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,852
He means Rattlesnake Jake, Mr Rango.

516
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,187
He never comes to town 'cause
he's scared of that hawk.

517
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,564
But he might come now.

518
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,232
Can l have your boots
when you're dead?

519
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,400
No!

520
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,861
And l ain't got no problem
with this Rattlesnake Jake.

521
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,612
That's just what Amos said.

522
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,823
Amos?

523
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,495
You got any gold fillings?

524
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:41,349
My feIIow Dirtonians.

525
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:46,438
I weIcome you to our great day
of deIiverance. HaIIeIujah.

526
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,106
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

527
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,735
AcoIytes, prepare the hoIy spigot!

528
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,665
We have a newcomer
amongst us today, my friends.

529
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,502
A man I think needs
IittIe introduction to you

530
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,756
so boId has been his entry
into our fair society.

531
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,093
Mr Rango, wouId you step forward?

532
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:26,269
The time has come, my friends.
The time that was foretoId!

533
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,021
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

534
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:29,523
The sacred time!

535
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,399
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

536
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,860
The time of destiny!

537
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,529
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

538
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,115
The time of deIiverance!

539
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,241
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

540
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:43,453
It is the time of hydration!

541
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,388
- lt's his fault!
- lt's the newcomer!

542
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,181
- Burn him!
- He's a witch!

543
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,391
l get his boots!

544
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:08,728
My friends, my friends!
Temper your frustrations.

545
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:13,900
Times wiII be tough from now on.
Sacrifices wiII have to be made.

546
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:17,654
But if I can heIp in any way,
pIease know that my door is aIways...

547
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,364
Hold it, hold it!

548
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,242
Now, this whole thing
stinks three ways to Sunday.

549
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,828
First the bank's run dry
and now this here spigot?

550
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,954
The bank's run dry?

551
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,748
- What's she talking about?
- She said there's no water in the bank!

552
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,174
This is all we have!
We can't give it all out!

553
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,467
That was my rehydration account!

554
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:44,890
None of that civil disobedience
in my town, thank you very much.

555
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,770
Thank goodness you're here, Sheriff.
Things were getting out of hand.

556
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,731
Come right in.

557
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,860
Let me have a gander at the source
of the societal discontentment here.

558
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,072
Mercy.

559
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,867
All right, listen up! l've been thinking

560
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,745
and l believe l've figured something out.

561
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,289
You folks have a water problem!

562
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,919
Nowjust pay attention, everybody.
l'm trying to make a point here.

563
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,796
Let's say this fella here
were to take a drink of water.

564
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,674
Just one little drink.
No harm, no foul, right?

565
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,012
And you!

566
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:27,098
You're just as dried up and parched
as a jackrabbit in July.

567
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:30,268
So you belly on up
and take you a double shot!

568
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,355
Stay with me.

569
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:38,109
What do you think happens then?
Why we'd all be drinking!

570
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,738
And before you know it,
there wouldn't be any more water.

571
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,823
And then where would we be?

572
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,910
We'd be thirsty.

573
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,162
Real thirsty.

574
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,082
We'd turn on each other
like a bunch of animals!

575
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:59,589
Now look here.
We have got six days of water.

576
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,305
We have got five days...

577
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:12,435
As long as we've got water,
we've got ourselves a town.

578
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,563
Sheriff Rango is right.

579
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:19,276
As long as we have this water,
we have some hope.

580
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,152
And you can all take it from me.

581
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:24,698
My 100 % full-time employment
from this moment on

582
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:28,743
will be to protect
our precious natural resource.

583
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:32,664
Ain't no one gonna tango
with the Rango.

584
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,803
Evening, ladies.

585
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,680
Evening, Sheriff.

586
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,890
And don't you come back!

587
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:54,561
Hold on there, Gordy. You get back
in there and you assert yourself,

588
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,897
and l think you'll find the people of this
here town to be surprisingly hospitable.

589
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,274
Thank you, Sheriff.

590
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,234
What? Not you again!

591
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,487
l stand corrected.

592
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,121
- This ain't the bank.
- l told you, Jedidiah!

593
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,497
Hold it right there!

594
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:15,874
- Who's that?
- lt's the Sheriff!

595
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,625
Get them hands up
where l can see them!

596
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,420
Just as l suspected.

597
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,256
Prospecting without the authorised
equipment. Don't move a muscle.

598
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,550
Prospecting?

599
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,390
Now, you got your shovel,
pickaxe, Benadryl, loofah,

600
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,727
assorted snacks, some puzzle books
and you're gonna need a permit.

601
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,520
- Loofah.
- Ezekiel, Jedidiah!

602
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:39,856
What the Sam Hill's going on up there?

603
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,526
l've had polyps removed
smarter than the two of you!

604
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,196
Hell's fire, this ain't the bank!

605
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,908
Pappy, the Sheriff is standing right here,
helping us out.

606
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,744
Gonna give us a permit for prospecting.

607
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,413
That's right, sir. Just doing my duty.

608
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,249
The lonely constable on his rounds,

609
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,668
keeping an eagle eye out
for mayhem and malfeasance.

610
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,213
Does he look like he sounds?

611
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:08,468
Well, Sheriff,
if we was to hit the mother lode,

612
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,678
being prospectors and such,

613
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,932
where would we deposit said annuity?

614
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,975
Here in the town of Dirt,
we happen to have

615
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,895
the finest financial institution
this side of the Missouri.

616
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:23,233
Protected morning, noon and night
by yours truly.

617
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,986
Much obliged.

618
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:30,073
The bank's been robbed!
The bank's been robbed!

619
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,617
Good Lord, the bank's been robbed!

620
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,119
What's going on?

621
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,413
- lt's gone! The water's all gone!
- What'd he say?

622
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:37,789
He said the bank's been robbed!

623
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,543
Dr Marx! l'm on fire! Embrace me!

624
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:46,798
The bank's been robbed, the town is dry
"We'II die of thirst," the peopIe cry

625
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:51,428
He promised to protect the vauIt
The water's gone, it's aII his fauIt

626
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,055
All right, folks, stand back,
clear the area.

627
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,473
This is a crime scene now.

628
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:58,685
Secure the perimeter, dust for prints,
check for fibres, scan for DNA.

629
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,479
l want a urine sample from everyone.
And get me a latte.

630
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:02,897
And don't mix up the two.

631
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,149
What's this?

632
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,900
"Prospecting Permit."

633
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,777
l'll take that. Material evidence.

634
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,404
What are we gonna do now, Sheriff?

635
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,198
- We need that water.
- We're all going to die!

636
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,910
My friends, we all know
what we have to do now.

637
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:19,789
That's right.
We all know what we have to do now.

638
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,916
- And that would be?
- Form a posse.

639
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,877
Form a possum!

640
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,630
A posse.

641
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,135
Now, we're gonna be doing this
in an orderly fashion.

642
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,640
First off, does anybody here know
how to use a firearm of any kind?

643
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,728
All right, then.

644
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,354
What do we do now, Sheriff?

645
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:46,149
Now we ride!

646
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,539
Where are we going?

647
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:02,874
What?

648
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,792
Where are we going?

649
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,970
Now, as my deputy, you'll be in charge
of all tracking and finding of villains,

650
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:18,890
utilising your well-developed
lnjun-uity, no offence taken.

651
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,225
So which way do you think they went?

652
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,894
You want to sniff the air or commune
with a buffalo or something?

653
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,483
Oh, you're good.

654
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,779
l'm depending on you, Spoons.

655
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,532
You got a little tobaccy
in the beard there.

656
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,576
Always good to have a medical man
along, Doc.

657
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:41,412
Reptiles got to stick together, right,
my brother?

658
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:42,789
l'm an amphibian.

659
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,415
Ain't no shame in that.

660
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,171
You sure you're
fit for duty there, soldier?

661
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,883
Well, you got a little something
in your eye there.

662
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:58,429
Oh, that? That there's conjunctivitis, sir.
lt's hereditary.

663
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:02,350
Well, l'm glad to hear
it's not contagious.

664
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:06,688
Now, just wait a cotton-picking minute!
A posse ain't no place for a...

665
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,773
Never mind.

666
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:10,817
Hold on there, little sister.

667
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,611
Someone's gonna have
to look after the town while l'm gone.

668
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,864
Can l gut-shoot someone?

669
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,243
Let's put a pin in that.

670
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,705
Sheriff, you're going to bring
that water back, aren't you?

671
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,082
Count on it, little sister.

672
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,380
- Which way do we go, Sheriff?
- There's tunnels everywhere.

673
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,048
Whole town's perforated with them.

674
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,677
She got more holes in her
than a painted lady on a porcupine.

675
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,722
Hey, my daddy took me to her place.

676
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,099
Not what l expected.

677
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,853
How'd them fellers
find the bank, anyway?

678
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,063
Gentlemen, if we can just
stay on task here.

679
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,691
Sheriff! Over here!

680
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,738
- Would you look at that?
- Like seeing the face of God.

681
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,574
Amen, brother.

682
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,535
l remember when it used to flow
every Wednesday.

683
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,620
Those were the halcyon days.

684
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,956
Must be a reason she quit on us.

685
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,793
Whatever the reason,
something is controlling this here water.

686
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,670
What do you say, Sheriff?

687
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,674
Clearly, the robbers came
from this direction.

688
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:19,177
l say we track this pipe
back to its hydraulic origin

689
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,763
and apprehend the culprits
behind this aquatic conundrum.

690
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,182
- What'd he say?
- l think he said follow the pipe.

691
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,684
- He said follow the pipe.
- He said follow the pipe.

692
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,149
Sure is humid down here.

693
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,277
Yeah, it's activating my piles.

694
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,112
l had a goitre removed once.

695
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:41,324
Looked like Tony Bennett
stepping out of the shower.

696
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:44,243
Shoot, l put that on a tortilla.

697
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:59,842
Whatever you do, do not look down.

698
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:05,473
- What is this place?
- lt's an aquifer.

699
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,851
What's an aquifer?

700
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,937
Well, it's for aqua.

701
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,815
Well, it's empty now.

702
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,669
That's a big one.

703
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,924
- lt's the end of the line.
- Don't go no further.

704
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,803
Well, now that there is a pipe.
lt's got to be connected to something.

705
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,514
You talk too much.
Why don't you put a cork in it?

706
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,975
Why don't you put a cork...
Tell you where the sun don't shine.

707
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,560
Your mama did.
l'll cook her right up.

708
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,186
You two just don't get it, do you?

709
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,940
Someone or something
is messing with our hydration

710
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,984
and that pipe
has got something to do with it.

711
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,902
l thought
we was following bank robbers!

712
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,280
We're experiencing a paradigm shift.

713
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,991
l'm gonna shift the features on your face
if you don't shut up!

714
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,367
Go ahead and try!

715
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,038
Quiet, you savages! Stop your rattling.
You're affecting my cogitation.

716
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,419
Whoa! l got it. Snuff out them torches.

717
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:23,217
Sure enough.

718
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,553
Smart thinking there, feller.

719
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,347
- Start climbing.
- Get your foot out of my face!

720
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:29,974
Not bad, huh, Beans?

721
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,476
You keep thinking like that,
your hat's gonna catch on fire.

722
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:35,021
Well, you know, you get on a roll,
you just...

723
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,190
Hot, hot! Burn.

724
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,954
Poor things.
All they wanted was a little water.

725
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,499
Cactus dying of thirst. lt don't bode well.

726
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,293
- Hey, look what l found!
- What you got there?

727
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,296
- l saw that first!
- Hey, that's mine!

728
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,964
Give me that!

729
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:04,050
lt's empty anyway.

730
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,593
l knew that.

731
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,969
Where'd you find that?

732
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,889
Sheriff! You're going to want to see this!

733
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,269
lt's Mr Merrimack from the bank.

734
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:16,771
What's he doing here?

735
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,397
- Everybody stand back.
- All right, let me see.

736
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,983
Looks like them varmints shot him
in the back.

737
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:25,238
No, this man wasn't shot.
He was drowned!

738
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,990
- Drowned?
- ln the middle of the desert?

739
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,825
What a way to go.

740
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:35,248
Well, now, whose boot prints are those?

741
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:42,546
That's interesting.
The ground's still wet.

742
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,632
l suppose we should bury him.

743
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,301
l don't know. Birds got to eat, too.

744
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:48,678
Circle of life!

745
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,804
Sheriff.

746
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,430
Will you say a few words?

747
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:54,725
Yeah. Yeah.

748
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,479
Dearly beloved.

749
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:03,317
We are gathered here today
to honour this man.

750
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,152
Mr Merrimack,

751
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,154
you have the right to remain silent.

752
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,573
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

753
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:10,700
Amen.

754
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:12,034
- Amen.
- Amen.

755
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,079
Hey! What's that dad-gum lndian doing?

756
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,711
l see you're consulting with the spirits.

757
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,131
No, l'm moulting.
Means l'm ready to mate.

758
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,175
l'll keep that in mind.

759
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:29,969
Cactus fruit.

760
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,847
Ah, yes. The ancient cactus fruit.

761
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,724
l believe your people use it
as seasoning

762
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,267
when preparing your native dishes.

763
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,185
Also natural laxative.

764
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:40,938
Pick up trail.

765
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:44,483
Three men heading west.
One blind, one with

766
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,529
enlarged prostate, riding sidesaddle.

767
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,907
- What did he say?
- They're riding sidesaddle.

768
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,409
- We're whispering.
- What'd he say?

769
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,618
Someone's got a bad valve.

770
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:57,663
All right, which one of you fellers
needs a check-up?

771
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,749
Awkward.

772
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,378
What exactly are we going to do now?

773
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,381
Now we ride!

774
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,931
That means we're riding now!
This moment.

775
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,352
Marshmallows remind me
of going camping with my daddy.

776
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,604
l could eat them all night long.

777
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:08,609
Of course he did make me cough them
back up again for breakfast.

778
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:13,447
This one time,
l coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

779
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:17,368
That ain't nothing.
l coughed up a whole tribe of pygmies.

780
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,329
They started looking at me weird.

781
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:23,707
l remember them.
They was quite friendly.

782
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:27,336
l found a human spinal column
in my fecal matter once.

783
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,008
You might want to get that looked at.

784
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,262
Pass the beans, Beans.

785
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,055
- Sheriff?
- No, thanks.

786
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:42,560
Mr Rango? Can you tell us
about the Spirit of the West?

787
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,480
- Yeah, tell us about that.
- ls it true what they say?

788
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:50,234
Yes, the Spirit of the West!

789
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,736
The eternally unattainable ideal.

790
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,781
They say he rides in
an alabaster carriage

791
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,449
with golden guardians to protect him.

792
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:01,495
But he only appears to those
who have undertaken an epic quest!

793
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,664
And have made it

794
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,000
to the other side.

795
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,547
The other side of what?

796
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,591
lt's a metaphor.

797
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:14,717
My eye!

798
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,343
That's gonna heal right up.

799
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:20,431
Sheriff? What are you going to do
about Rattlesnake Jake?

800
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,016
What? Where?

801
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:27,730
Sorry about that. Word is
you come against him once or twice.

802
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,107
Yeah.

803
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,193
Jake. You mean my brother.

804
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,153
- Your brother?
- That's what l said!

805
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,531
But he's a snake and you're a lizard.

806
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,409
Well, Momma had an active social life.

807
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:42,953
Did he ever bite you?

808
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:46,457
Sure enough did. Look at that baby.
Go ahead, you can touch it.

809
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:50,461
That's interesting.
That there's a belly button.

810
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,129
Luckily, l'm immune to his venom.

811
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,131
Put some in my coffee
just to give it a little tang.

812
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,175
ls it true he's only scared
of them hawks?

813
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:59,887
Them's what we call
his natural predator.

814
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,808
All this talk of that serpentine devil
is putting my quills on edge!

815
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,894
l ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir.

816
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:10,147
Don't you all worry about a thing.
Come tomorrow, we'll locate that water

817
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,233
and return to a hero's welcome.

818
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,903
Friends, before we bunk down

819
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,447
l'd like us all to join hands
for a moment,

820
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,283
say a few words
to the Spirit of the West.

821
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,993
That's a good idea.

822
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:28,123
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West.

823
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,129
But tonight l want to thank you for
bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

824
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,799
lt's a hard life we got.

825
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,802
Sometimes l don't know how
we're gonna make it.

826
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:43,722
But somehow, Sheriff Rango
makes me think we will.

827
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,601
We needed a brave man
and you sent us one.

828
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,772
Nice to have someone
to believe in again.

829
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:55,484
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.

830
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,320
- Amen.
- Amen.

831
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,979
Just checking.

832
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:37,318
- lt's a little cold tonight.
- Thank you.

833
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,656
You ever feel like those things
are looking at you?

834
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:44,491
That's a Spanish dagger.

835
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:47,411
But around here,
we just call them the Walking Cactus.

836
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,579
Walking?

837
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:52,583
There's an old legend they actually
walk across the desert to find water.

838
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:56,420
When l was a little girl, l'd stay up late
watching them, to see if they'd move.

839
01:01:56,504 --> 01:02:00,591
l thought if l could follow them,
they'd lead me to someplace wonderful.

840
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:04,345
Someplace with enough water
for everyone.

841
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:09,808
Night after night, l watched them.
l never saw them move.

842
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:11,810
But you're still watching.

843
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:14,938
Who doesn't want to find
someplace wonderful?

844
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,692
We'll find the water, Beans.
l promise you.

845
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,490
That's such a lonely sound.

846
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,284
You ever get lonely?

847
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:28,786
Sometimes.

848
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:33,374
l can't imagine it. You're such a charmer
and everyone likes you so much.

849
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,877
- l never made friends easy like that.
- No?

850
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:40,130
No, we're pretty isolated
out there on the ranch,

851
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,966
sort of like being sealed up
in a little box.

852
01:02:43,051 --> 01:02:46,470
Don't really see a lot of folks.

853
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,806
l wouldn't know what that's like.

854
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:52,184
There someone special
in your life, Rango?

855
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,646
There used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.

856
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,731
Besides, my life's too dangerous
for that kind of thing.

857
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,901
You know, it's an awful solitary
existence out there on the prairie.

858
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:03,237
Riding the ranges and the suchlike.

859
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:09,159
Beans?

860
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:30,347
l'm gonna skin you alive, boy! l'm gonna
whup you like a red-headed stepchild!

861
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,765
Choleric varmints, ain't they?

862
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,852
Dysfunctional family. Need intervention.

863
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,396
What's that coming?

864
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:40,899
lt's the water.

865
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,780
l have a plan, and each and every one
of you has a part to play.

866
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,115
What do l do?

867
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,033
Spoons, you got
the most important job of all.

868
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,369
You stay up here on the ridge,
and if anything goes wrong,

869
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:55,289
you give the signal.

870
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,636
Hey, Beans.
What size dress you wearing?

871
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,389
- He got it!
- Hallelujah!

872
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:14,141
- He found the water!
- You did it, son.

873
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,309
Well, actually...

874
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,228
Why can't you be all brainy
like your brother?

875
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,731
Pappy, about that water.
There's something l gots to tell you.

876
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,649
Hush up, now. Somebody's coming.

877
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:28,489
Good sirs, gracious good afternoon
to thee and thee and thee.

878
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,824
May l present Madame Lupone's

879
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:33,327
Terpsichorean Troupe
of Travelling Thespians!

880
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,331
- What is that?
- l think they's thespians.

881
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:40,501
Thespians?
That's illegal in seven states!

882
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:44,421
The stage is set. The princess
prepares to take her own life.

883
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:46,131
l yearn for love.

884
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:49,134
Meanwhile, the lone sentry
stands watch at the castle gate.

885
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,930
Stands watch at the castle gate...

886
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,099
Hark! Who goes there?

887
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:58,018
This plot is highly predictable.

888
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,436
Quiet! This is my favourite part.

889
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:02,189
Arriving to great fanfare
'twas her aged father,

890
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,653
strucketh by Cupid.

891
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:12,032
Prithee, unhand my fair daughter

892
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,825
and reach for the...

893
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,996
- Line?
- "Reach for the sky!"

894
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,125
What was that?

895
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:24,211
Must be that immersive theatre.

896
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,546
We got you surrounded!

897
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:29,550
You and your entire family get
your hands up where l can see them.

898
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,052
My entire family?

899
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:40,978
Grits and spit and coIIard greens

900
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:45,482
Waffle chitIins, monkey brains

901
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:49,403
Refried bones and booger bIood

902
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,864
PickIed eggs and flaps of mud

903
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,328
lt's a full house.

904
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:01,707
Looks like we're gonna have ourselves
a good old-fashioned standoff.

905
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:06,587
l'll have you know, you're not looking
at our entire contingent.

906
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:15,596
What's that supposed to be?

907
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,097
That's the signal.

908
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:20,851
That's the signal!
Something must have gone wrong!

909
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:28,609
So something's supposed to happen?

910
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:32,195
l am open to suggestions.

911
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,622
Run!

912
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,046
Get on the wagon!

913
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,804
Should we have ourselves
some sport, chill'ens?

914
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,724
l likes it when they run.

915
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:03,810
Maybelle, give the holler!

916
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,735
Looks like we made it!

917
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,320
That audience was quite responsive.

918
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,281
Yeah, well, l think that
chromosome pool is about dried up.

919
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:44,935
We got bats!

920
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,646
Here! You drive.

921
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:58,031
Looks like there's gonna be
soup tonight!

922
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,617
Come on, let's get some!

923
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:13,213
What in tarnation?
Don't shoot the water!

924
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,800
Jedidiah! lt's time for
the Alabama squeeze box!

925
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,343
Okay, Pa!

926
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,227
l am sensing hostility.

927
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:28,520
lncoming!

928
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,569
Hello!

929
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:36,862
Goodbye!

930
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:49,040
Lasso that swine!

931
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,271
l suggest we take evasive action!

932
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,273
l suggest you shut up and shoot!

933
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,942
- What happened to the Sheriff?
- He had a previous engagement!

934
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,737
Boseefus, give them some gumbo now!

935
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:28,079
What was that? Go check it out!

936
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:31,082
What is it? ls there a problem?

937
01:09:33,461 --> 01:09:34,920
You could call it that.

938
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,469
Headache.

939
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,266
ls that all you got?

940
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,369
That wasn't altogether unpleasant!

941
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,038
Eat lead!

942
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,301
Here, hold these.

943
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,855
Get your hands off me!

944
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,361
Oh, l'm sorry.

945
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:33,246
Jump!

946
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,729
lt's impossible.

947
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,066
lt can't be. lt's empty.

948
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,859
There's no water!

949
01:12:02,944 --> 01:12:06,404
No water?
Then what the hell we been fighting for?

950
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:10,742
Sir, you have defiled and desecrated
the very sustenance of our livelihood!

951
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:13,453
l think that there fella in the purty dress
is the Sheriff.

952
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,122
That's the same fellow what give us
a prospecting permit?

953
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:19,084
- A what?
- lrrelevant! Obfuscation.

954
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,169
You and your kin are under arrest
for bank robbery

955
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:23,296
and the murder
of our beloved financial advisor

956
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:26,883
Johannes Merrimack the Third,
AKA, Fluffy Joe.

957
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:28,551
Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.

958
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:31,012
We done tunnelled into that vault,
but there weren't nothing in it.

959
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,056
Somebody done robbed that bank
before we robbed it.

960
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,891
Then where'd you get this here jug?

961
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:36,977
That's what l been trying
to tell you, Pappy.

962
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,269
l found it in the desert.

963
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,606
Then why in tarnation
did you bring it here?

964
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:45,652
Hold on! You're saying this here jug
was empty when you found it?

965
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:46,987
That's right.

966
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,405
l don't believe a word of it.

967
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,031
- Let's hang them, Sheriff!
- String them up!

968
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:51,616
Who'd dump water in the desert?

969
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,785
Wouldn't be the first time.

970
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:57,038
lt's a puzzle!
lt's like a big old mammogram!

971
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:58,999
What's going on, Sheriff?

972
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,458
l don't know.

973
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:04,587
But l'm going to strip away this mystery
and expose its private parts.

974
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,965
You and your kin are coming with me.

975
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,679
They're coming!

976
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,514
Here they come!

977
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:18,184
Looks like they got them robbers.

978
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:42,167
Where's the water?

979
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:47,172
There weren't no water.

980
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,021
Where is he going?

981
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:06,566
He's going to see the Mayor.

982
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,653
He's got to be pleased with that.

983
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,572
That's a good one, boss!

984
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:23,458
That's interesting.

985
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:26,419
l do apologise for the shoes, Mr Rango,

986
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:29,839
but there's a certain protocol
to this game, you understand.

987
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,258
l'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.

988
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:35,303
Well, that's good, 'cause you got
a few questions to answer

989
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:37,722
and l've got my own protocol.

990
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:44,604
But why would anyone dump water
in the blooming desert?

991
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:48,733
lt does seem a bit naïve, taking the word
of admitted bank robbers.

992
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:52,445
Besides, once they hang,
yourjob is done.

993
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,030
- Bravo!
- Job well done.

994
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:57,075
But what if somebody did rob the bank
before they got there?

995
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,327
And who would do that, Mr Rango?

996
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,663
l was hoping you could tell me.

997
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:04,749
That sounds marginally
near to an accusation.

998
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,835
Take it any way you like.

999
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:15,802
Something you said keeps rattling
around in my frontal lobe.

1000
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,095
What's that?

1001
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:21,474
"Control the water
and you control everything."

1002
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,144
Come now, Mr Rango.

1003
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:27,147
You attribute divine power to me.

1004
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:30,441
How on earth
could l possibly control the water?

1005
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:36,030
You've obviously mastered this game.

1006
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:39,576
Well, l've been playing it
for many years, sir.

1007
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,829
l was here before the highway split
this great valley.

1008
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,582
l watched the march of progress,

1009
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:48,168
and l learned a thing or two.

1010
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,838
Perhaps it's time you started
to take the long view,

1011
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:55,800
begin to appreciate
the broad sweep of history.

1012
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:57,969
Look out there, son.

1013
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:01,306
You can almost see time passing.

1014
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,603
What are you building out here?

1015
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:10,023
The future, Mr Rango, the future.

1016
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,818
One day soon,
all this is going to fade into myth,

1017
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:16,738
the frontier town, the lawman,
the gunslinger.

1018
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,240
There's just no place
for them any more.

1019
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:22,660
- We're civilised now.
- That's right, civilised.

1020
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:25,079
That's what the future holds.

1021
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:28,541
You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.

1022
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:32,795
ls that what happened to
Mr Merrimack? Did he get left behind?

1023
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,550
Careful, Mr Rango. You seem to forget
you're just one little lizard.

1024
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:41,721
You seem to forget
l'm the law around these parts.

1025
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:47,477
Our new sheriff has been
playing the hero for so long,

1026
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,979
he's actually starting to believe it.

1027
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:52,523
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

1028
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,276
But Jake's the Grim Reaper.

1029
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,737
He never leaves
without taking a blooming soul.

1030
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,072
Do it!

1031
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:17,799
Now be still. You gotta look
presentable to meet your maker.

1032
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:26,975
Death has arrived

1033
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:35,817
How wiII the hero survive?

1034
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,740
The Mayor has bought up
all the land in the valley,

1035
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:44,701
except for your ranch, Miss Beans.

1036
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:48,621
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

1037
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,541
Unless he controls the water.

1038
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,501
Like a monkey's bladder!

1039
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,878
Then he could bring it back
once he's bought up all the land.

1040
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,089
But how does he control the water?

1041
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:02,552
Well, you gotta spend some time
and train them.

1042
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:05,763
'Cause you know monkeys, when
they do go, you rub their nose in it.

1043
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,974
Sheriff, we got a problem.

1044
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,109
Hold on, Beans.
That won't be necessary.

1045
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:24,866
- Hang him till his head turns blue!
- Give us them robbers!

1046
01:18:24,992 --> 01:18:27,410
Hold on! Calm down, everyone!
Let me talk!

1047
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:29,787
- Nail them to the courthouse!
- Now, calm down, everybody.

1048
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:32,540
Get them out here
so we can cut off their giblets!

1049
01:18:33,167 --> 01:18:34,751
You, too, Spoons?

1050
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:38,212
They done taken that water.
They taken everything we got!

1051
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:41,299
No one's stringing anyone up.
Not while l'm sheriff.

1052
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,633
But this is all his fault!

1053
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,094
You said you's gonna
bring the water back.

1054
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,722
lt's just, we got no hope
without that water.

1055
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,724
We got nothing left to believe in.

1056
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:51,976
You see that sign up there?

1057
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,896
As long as that sign says "Sheriff,"

1058
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:57,356
you can believe that there's
law and order in this town.

1059
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:01,527
But without law and order,
ruminate on that. Oh, yeah.

1060
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:04,822
Starts out slow, like a fungus.

1061
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:07,575
Somebody says a cross word.
Accusations start flying.

1062
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,495
Neighbour turns on neighbour.
Pretty soon, we're eating our children!

1063
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:11,996
And then dogs and cats
are getting together

1064
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,749
to create all sorts of unnatural
mutant aberrations!

1065
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:19,378
So, you want something
to believe in, Spoons?

1066
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,047
Believe in me.

1067
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,592
Believe in that there sign.

1068
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:29,055
For as long as it hangs there,
we got hope.

1069
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,916
Hello, brother.

1070
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:59,085
Thirsty?

1071
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:14,308
Long time, brother.
How you been keeping?

1072
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,477
Well, you know...

1073
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:23,234
l hear you been telling about how
you killed all them Jenkins brothers.

1074
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,987
With one bullet, wasn't it?

1075
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:27,989
lsn't that right?

1076
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:32,326
All these good folks here
believe your little stories, don't they?

1077
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:36,247
Why, they believe you're just
a stone killer, don't they?

1078
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,584
Seems these folks trust you.

1079
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,753
They think you're gonna save
their little town.

1080
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:46,340
They think you're gonna save
their little souls!

1081
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:53,931
But we know better, don't we?

1082
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:03,107
So why don't you show your friends here
what you're made of?

1083
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:06,027
Show them who you really are.

1084
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:09,155
Why don't you just pull your gun
and shoot me?

1085
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:12,158
But, of course, you won't need all these.

1086
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:14,202
Just one, right?

1087
01:21:16,496 --> 01:21:19,957
Go ahead, hero. Pull the trigger.

1088
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,379
You got killer in your eyes, son?

1089
01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:28,841
l don't see it.

1090
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:35,348
You didn't do any of them things
you said, did you?

1091
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:39,477
You didn't kill them Jenkins brothers.
You ain't even from the West!

1092
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,728
Are you?

1093
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:44,148
- Say it!
- No.

1094
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:48,361
Speak up.
l don't think your friends here heard you.

1095
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,030
No.

1096
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:53,658
All you've done is lie
to these good people.

1097
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:57,995
You ain't nothing but a fake
and a coward. lsn't that right?

1098
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,413
Yes.

1099
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:01,249
- Louder!
- Yes.

1100
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:08,881
Listen close, you pathetic fraud.

1101
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:12,009
This is my town now.

1102
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:16,555
lf l ever see you again, l will take
your soul straight down to hell!

1103
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:35,074
Who are you?

1104
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,192
Who am I?

1105
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,071
I'm nobody.

1106
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:33,270
Golden guardians.

1107
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,815
The alabaster carriage.

1108
01:26:41,821 --> 01:26:44,323
The Spirit of the West.

1109
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:52,665
Excuse me? Mister Spirit, sir?

1110
01:26:55,168 --> 01:27:00,172
There's a beaut. Sometimes you got to
dig deep to find what you're looking for.

1111
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:03,217
So you made it.

1112
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:05,427
ls this heaven?

1113
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:09,348
lf it were, we'd be eating Pop-Tarts
with Kim Novak.

1114
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:10,808
Yeah.

1115
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:14,144
No kidding.
What are you doing out here?

1116
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:16,522
Searching, same as you.

1117
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,776
l don't even know
what l'm looking for any more.

1118
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:22,820
l don't even know who l am.

1119
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,864
They used to call you
the Man with No Name.

1120
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:31,120
These days they got a name
forjust about everything.

1121
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:35,499
Doesn't matter what they call you.
lt's the deeds make the man.

1122
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:39,378
Yeah, but my deeds just made things
worse. l'm a fraud. l'm a phoney!

1123
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:43,382
My friends believed in me,
but they need some kind of hero.

1124
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,175
Then be a hero.

1125
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:49,179
No. No, no, you don't understand.
l'm not even supposed to be here.

1126
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:53,517
That's right. You came a long way
to find something that isn't out here.

1127
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:57,271
Don't you see? lt's not about you.

1128
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,857
lt's about them.

1129
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:04,194
But l can't go back.

1130
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,697
Don't know that you got a choice, son.

1131
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:13,287
No man can walk out on his own story.

1132
01:28:25,759 --> 01:28:27,468
So you made it.

1133
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:32,765
That's right, amigo.
The other side of the road.

1134
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:37,478
Did you just see that?

1135
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:40,773
We each see what we need to see.

1136
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:43,776
Beautiful, isn't it?

1137
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:56,914
Yeah.

1138
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,416
lt is.

1139
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:03,796
Come, my friend.
l want to show you something.

1140
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:12,096
Many years ago,
this entire valley was covered in agua.

1141
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:16,141
Now only one question remains.

1142
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:18,936
Where did it go?

1143
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,973
They follow the water.

1144
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:59,184
They follow the water! Come on!

1145
01:30:34,053 --> 01:30:38,682
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

1146
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:41,351
What are you building out here?

1147
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,353
The future, Mr Rango.

1148
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:48,025
You can either be part of it,
or you can be Ieft behind.

1149
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:53,280
I was here before the highway spIit
this great vaIIey.

1150
01:30:56,367 --> 01:30:58,952
I watched the march of progress

1151
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:01,330
and I Iearned a thing or two.

1152
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:08,796
Control the water

1153
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:11,298
and you control everything.

1154
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:20,390
Come now, Mr Rango.

1155
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,309
You attribute divine power to me.

1156
01:31:22,435 --> 01:31:24,978
How on earth
couId I possibIy controI the water?

1157
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:03,892
What now, amigo?

1158
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,570
No man can walk out on his own story.

1159
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:17,573
l'm going back.

1160
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:20,409
But why?

1161
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,537
Because that's who l am.

1162
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:40,345
You got a lot of nerve showing up here,
lawman. What is it you want?

1163
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:45,058
Your pappy and them boys are about
to hang for something they didn't do.

1164
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:48,186
But l've got a plan.

1165
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:19,092
l appreciate how difficult
this is for you, Beans.

1166
01:33:19,218 --> 01:33:22,179
But you're making a practical decision.

1167
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:25,015
Decisions, decisions.

1168
01:33:25,099 --> 01:33:28,268
There's no need for any more suffering.

1169
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:38,278
Your family's ranch is nothing
but a wasteland now.

1170
01:33:38,821 --> 01:33:43,575
Sign the deed and relieve yourself
of your father's burden.

1171
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,455
My daddy was not a burden!

1172
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:50,958
Keep your blood money
and l'll keep my land!

1173
01:33:57,090 --> 01:34:00,258
Do what he says or,
by all the fires of the black pit,

1174
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:03,762
l'll squeeze them pretty brown eyes
out of your skull!

1175
01:34:04,514 --> 01:34:06,723
Now, hold on, Jake.
There's no need to...

1176
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:09,142
Let me do my job! You brought me in.

1177
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:11,812
Now we're gonna play this thing
out to the end!

1178
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:15,107
Sign the damn paper, woman!

1179
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,109
Go to hell!

1180
01:34:17,276 --> 01:34:19,611
Where do you think l come from?

1181
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,531
Look into my eyes.

1182
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:24,992
l want to see you die.

1183
01:34:30,123 --> 01:34:31,331
Jake!

1184
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,670
l'm calling you out!

1185
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:40,465
Jake!

1186
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,178
This day
just got a little more interesting.

1187
01:35:12,415 --> 01:35:13,623
Put her down.

1188
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:17,335
Or what, little man?
You going to kill me?

1189
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,337
That's just about the size of it.

1190
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:24,634
- Get your filthy paws off me!
- Shut your gob!

1191
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,888
All right, Sheriff, make your move.

1192
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:01,648
Nown amigos!

1193
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:08,864
- Heave! Heave!
- Heave! Heave!

1194
01:37:26,799 --> 01:37:29,050
That was a bad idea.

1195
01:37:33,472 --> 01:37:34,514
Thirsty, brother?

1196
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:40,353
Here it comes!

1197
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:43,190
No. No!

1198
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:48,820
lt's a miracle!

1199
01:37:48,988 --> 01:37:50,363
Look out!

1200
01:37:57,496 --> 01:37:59,164
- Lookee there!
- What is that?

1201
01:38:01,083 --> 01:38:02,500
lt's our salvation, Pa!

1202
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:05,712
lt's a jailbreak, boys! We're busting out!

1203
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:20,018
l'm gonna blow so many holes in you,
your guts'll be leaking lead!

1204
01:38:20,102 --> 01:38:22,854
Well, then
it's a good thing l brought some backup.

1205
01:38:34,116 --> 01:38:35,200
What?

1206
01:38:38,955 --> 01:38:40,830
Ain't no hawk.

1207
01:38:40,915 --> 01:38:43,375
Ain't nothing but bats!

1208
01:38:45,544 --> 01:38:49,798
Stick to the plan, boys!
Let's bleed that devil dry!

1209
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:03,395
lt only takes one bullet.

1210
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:05,605
You ain't got the nerve.

1211
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:08,233
Try me.

1212
01:39:12,571 --> 01:39:14,239
Oh, Mr Rango.

1213
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:16,574
Aren't you forgetting something?

1214
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:23,790
Hand me your gun, Sheriff.

1215
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:28,461
Now, Mr Rango.

1216
01:39:40,599 --> 01:39:42,934
Beans! Hold on.
Don't worry, l got a plan.

1217
01:39:43,853 --> 01:39:45,979
Help!

1218
01:39:46,105 --> 01:39:48,440
Open the door!

1219
01:39:49,025 --> 01:39:50,525
Okay, plan B.

1220
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:52,819
Beans, you're mumbling.

1221
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:57,532
All my problems taken care of
except for one.

1222
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,326
lt's a new West, Jake.

1223
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:03,788
There's no room for gunslingers
any more. We're businessmen now.

1224
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:05,623
Yeah, we got new hats.

1225
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:09,336
Where l come from,
we call this improvisation.

1226
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:12,464
You came back.

1227
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:21,890
What was that?

1228
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:24,559
No need to panic,
but l think you just swallowed plan B.

1229
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:25,810
What?

1230
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:28,938
Okay, panic time.

1231
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:31,983
You and the Sheriff are more alike
than you think.

1232
01:40:32,068 --> 01:40:33,902
You're nothing but legends.

1233
01:40:33,986 --> 01:40:37,739
Pretty soon,
no one will believe you even existed.

1234
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:43,578
One last bullet to kill one last outlaw.

1235
01:40:45,915 --> 01:40:47,665
How fitting.

1236
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:24,077
Sheriff, l'm sure if we work together,

1237
01:41:24,203 --> 01:41:28,331
we can reach a mutually beneficial
solution to our current situation.

1238
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:30,708
You better take it up with him.

1239
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:43,721
One bullet.

1240
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:47,434
l tip my hat to you,

1241
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,437
one legend to another.

1242
01:41:52,273 --> 01:41:54,482
What was that you said?

1243
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:59,279
"Pretty soon,
no one will believe you even existed."

1244
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,573
No, Jake! No!

1245
01:42:13,919 --> 01:42:15,295
Rango!

1246
01:42:16,755 --> 01:42:20,550
You brought the water back,
just like you promised.

1247
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:22,302
You really are a hero.

1248
01:42:23,596 --> 01:42:26,764
Well, the thing about heroes is,
whenever you...

1249
01:42:26,849 --> 01:42:28,641
Don't spoil it.

1250
01:42:28,767 --> 01:42:29,976
Right.

1251
01:42:30,478 --> 01:42:33,771
Well, l don't know about you all,
but l could sure go for a dip.

1252
01:42:37,276 --> 01:42:40,195
And so the lizard completes his journey

1253
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:44,324
from humble beginnings
to the legend we sing of today.

1254
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:49,120
And although he is certain to die,
perhaps from a household accident,

1255
01:42:49,205 --> 01:42:52,248
which account
for 65 % of all unnatural deaths,

1256
01:42:52,333 --> 01:42:55,793
the people of the village
will honour his memory

1257
01:42:55,961 --> 01:42:59,130
even as they abandon their dignity.

1258
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:09,057
- l'm going in.
- How about a cold one, there?

1259
01:43:09,141 --> 01:43:11,184
Water ain't money. Money is money.

1260
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:13,895
- Well, l ain't got no...
- We're talking hard cash.

1261
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:15,772
We have a problem.

1262
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:18,524
Who let Snuggles in the pool again?

1263
01:43:18,651 --> 01:43:21,069
l really think you complete me.

1264
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:23,363
Prithee, unhand my fair maiden.

1265
01:43:23,489 --> 01:43:26,574
- Cut. Cut. Everybody, take five.
- How can you keep missing your mark?

1266
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:27,700
What's my motivation?

1267
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,037
Oh, you kids.

1268
01:43:31,163 --> 01:43:32,997
What did you do that for?

1269
01:43:33,082 --> 01:43:35,541
l was just checking.
l hear if you get too sunburnt,

1270
01:43:35,668 --> 01:43:37,418
you can peel a man's face right off.

1271
01:43:37,503 --> 01:43:39,087
- What is it?
- That there's some human spleen.

1272
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:40,255
Don't touch it.

1273
01:43:40,339 --> 01:43:41,923
That's the second time
that's happened to me.

1274
01:43:42,007 --> 01:43:43,591
This water thing's great.

1275
01:43:43,676 --> 01:43:45,176
l'm urinating right now.

1276
01:43:45,261 --> 01:43:48,388
Adult swim, next five minutes.

1277
01:43:48,514 --> 01:43:50,848
Stay between the buoys.

1278
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:52,267
l packed your lunch. Danish is in there

1279
01:43:52,351 --> 01:43:54,060
and l picked the raisins out
just the way you like it.

1280
01:43:54,186 --> 01:43:56,187
Don't forget, your nasal spray is
in your saddle-bag...

1281
01:43:56,272 --> 01:43:57,897
- Beans!
- ...and your moisturising lotion...

1282
01:43:58,023 --> 01:44:00,233
- Now, Beans! We've talked about this.
- Lotion?

1283
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:03,069
That's for my gun. That's gun lotion.

1284
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:04,779
Sheriff, where are you headed?

1285
01:44:04,863 --> 01:44:07,782
There's trouble down a dry creek.
Bad Bill's been acting up again.

1286
01:44:07,866 --> 01:44:09,742
Now, honey, you come back
with all your digits.

1287
01:44:09,868 --> 01:44:11,202
And don't go trying to be a hero.

1288
01:44:11,287 --> 01:44:12,745
Beans, you are missing the point.

1289
01:44:12,871 --> 01:44:15,206
l got an image to protect now.

1290
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:17,875
Where's my Tic Tacs?

1291
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:21,129
- l found them.
- What's going on?

1292
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:24,132
Well, in order to satisfy the needs
of the collective,

1293
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:26,009
the hero must abandon the self

1294
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:30,054
and solidify his image as an icon
that will forever be remembered.

1295
01:44:30,889 --> 01:44:33,266
So, this is the sunset shot.

1296
01:44:41,734 --> 01:44:43,776
Give them a good one, amigo.

1297
01:44:53,245 --> 01:44:54,787
Ready, Excelsior?

1298
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:57,040
My fellow comrades.

1299
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:59,792
There will be times
when you doubt yourself.

1300
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:03,087
When you feel pummelled
by the cataclysms of life,

1301
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:07,050
remember this moment.
Remember me.

1302
01:45:07,593 --> 01:45:10,386
Know that l will be there watching you,

1303
01:45:10,596 --> 01:45:13,431
sometimes at inappropriate moments.

1304
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:16,059
That's part of the deal.

1305
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:19,604
And remember, within all of us resides

1306
01:45:19,938 --> 01:45:22,690
the true Spirit of the...

1307
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:27,904
Let's take it from the top.
