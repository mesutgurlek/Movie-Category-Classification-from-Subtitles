in only seven years, America has risen
to the challenge of what he called...

5
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,976
""the most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure...

with our manned space program,

during a routine test...

- Get us outta here !

there were serious doubts that
we could beat the Russians to the moon.

13
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,585
But tonight, a mere 18 months
after the tragedy of Apollo 1,

as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...

The important thing when you're
penetrating the lunar module...

00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,945
is your attitude
and your relative speed.

Here is ABC science editor

921
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:50,646
The Apollo 13 spacecraft
has lost all electrical power,

922
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:53,315
and astronauts Jim Lovell,
Fred Haise and Jack Swigert...

What exactly does that mean ?

The emergency has ruled out
any chance of a lunar landing...

and could endanger the lives
of the astronauts themselves...

is left of the command module's oxygen,

- Who wanted a quote ?
- The President.

1042
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:40,722
- The President ?
- Nixon. He wants odds.

1043
01:09:40,806 --> 01:09:43,892
- [ Sighs ]
- We are not losing the crew.

1044
01:09:43,976 --> 01:09:46,895
l gotta give him odds.
Five to one against ?

1045
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:48,897
- Three to one ?
- l don't think they're that good.

1046
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:51,984
We are not losing those men !

1047

- [ Muttering ]
- How long are they
gonna have to burn the engine ?

1048
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:02,452
Look, tell him...
three to one.

[ CAPCOM ]
Expect loss of signal
in less than one minute.

1050
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,587
When we pick you back up we will have
your P.C. plus two burn data.

1051
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:16,592
[ Haise ]
Roger that, Houston. We'll hear
from you again at acquisition of signal.

1052
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:20,262
You wanna look ?

1053
01:10:21,597 --> 01:10:25,851
Oh, look at that.

1054
01:10:25,934 --> 01:10:27,853
Wow.

1055
01:10:31,857 --> 01:10:37,196
[ CAPCOM On Squawk Box ]
Aquarius, that's 30 seconds
until loss of signal.

1056

[ Haise ]
Mare Tranquillitatis.

1057
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,872
Neil and Buzz's
old neighborhood.

1058
01:10:46,955 --> 01:10:49,208
Comin' up on Mount Marilyn.

1059
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:53,212
Jim, you gotta
take a look at this.

1060
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:55,631
l've seen it.

1061
01:11:01,136 --> 01:11:03,055
[ CAPCOM ]
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1062
01:11:03,138 --> 01:11:08,060
We expect loss of signal
in approximately ten seconds.

1063
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:11,313
[ Swigert ]
So long, Earth.
Catch you on the flip side.

[ Transmission
Static Crackling ]

1065
01:11:18,153 --> 01:11:21,406
When you go
into the shadow of the moon...

1066
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:23,909
and the moon is
between you and the sun,

1067
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:27,704
then you see stars that are more
brilliant than anything you've seen...

1068
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:29,873
on the clearest nights
here on Earth.

1069
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:35,546
And then you pass into the lunar sunrise
over the lunar surface.

1070
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:37,881
lt must be
an awe-inspiring sight.

1071
01:11:37,923 --> 01:11:40,676
l-l-l can't wait
to see it myself.

1072
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:45,055
The problem now is not so much
a question of an adequate oxygen supply,

1073
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:47,099
but it is the rate
of consumption of water,

1074
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:50,394
which is vitally needed
for the cooling operations...

1075
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:52,938
to maintain the electronic systems
and so forth.
