Did you see?

Fear is a sickness.

It will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it.

It has tainted your peace already.

I did not raise you
to see you live with fear.

00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:42,197
...the Goddess of the Scaffold
shows no mercy for the weakness...

346
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,700
Her soul waits for yours
in the shade of the Ceiba Tree.

347
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,584
I need to know.

348
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:07,894
Before this day's end
I will leave this world.

349
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:15,260
I will take as many
of these bastard dogs with me as I can.

350
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:22,408
And I will gladly embrace
the torments of hell...

351
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,948
...if I do not find my Sky Flower there.

352
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,882
[thundering]

353
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,458
Don't rain.

354
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:03,151
- [indistinct chatter]
- [tree rumbling]

355
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:08,090
[men shouting]

356
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,600
I am walking here.

357
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,981
[weeping]

358
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,429
Keep away, she has the sickness.

359
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,692
[man] Get back!

360
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,435
- [grunts]
- [moans]

361
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,713
You fear me?

362
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:22,717
So you should...

363
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,794
...all you who are vile.

364
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:33,359
Would you like to know how you will die?

365
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:44,244
The sacred time is near...

366
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,580
Beware the blackness of day.

367
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:58,557
Beware the man who brings the jaguar.

368
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:06,128
Behold him reborn from mud and earth...

369
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:13,073
For the one he takes you to
will cancel the sky...

370
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:17,077
...and scratch out the earth.

371
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,512
Scratch you out.

372
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,480
And end your world.

373
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,188
He's with us now.

374
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,003
...day will be like night.

375
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:49,102
And the man jaguar
will lead you to your end.

376
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,784
[indistinct shouting]

377
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,347
Where are they taking us?

378
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:11,059
We tell stories of a place stone-built.

379
01:02:12,595 --> 01:02:14,119
What happens there?

380
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,463
I do not know...

381
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,527
...but the earth bleeds.

382
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,474
We are near.

383
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,776
Salvation!

384
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,446
He has the laughing sickness.

385
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,482
He likes you!

386
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,289
Help me!

387
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:30,502
Save me.

388
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:39,938
Die like a man.

389
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,007
[whimpering]

390
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,569
[chanting]

391
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:01,388
[growling]

392
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:21,668
Welcome back.

393
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,279
Have you been successful?

394
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,972
Ask my son.

395
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:29,282
How many captives?

396
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:30,485
Deal with my son.

397
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:33,646
A fair price.

398
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:36,854
As always, trust me.

399
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:38,352
Good.

400
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:42,327
[speaking in Mayan]

401
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:58,908
How much will you give me?

402
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,378
[shouting indistinctly]

403
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,543
[shouting in Mayan]

404
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:42,180
[all yelling]

405
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,543
Who will buy this woman?

406
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:04,977
No... she's too old.

407
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,112
She can be useful.

408
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,312
She can cook... clean...

409
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:13,913
Useless old woman!

410
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,117
No sale.

411
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,232
Go!

412
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:28,598
Go on.

413
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,304
[chanting continues]

414
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:22,282
