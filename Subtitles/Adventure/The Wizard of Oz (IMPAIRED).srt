All that you give

325
01:24:32,778 --> 01:24:34,237
All that you deal

326
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:37,074
All that you buy,

327
01:24:37,616 --> 01:24:39,910
beg, borrow or steal.

328
01:24:40,744 --> 01:24:42,370
All you create

329
01:24:43,288 --> 01:24:44,998
All you destroy

330
01:24:45,957 --> 01:24:47,626
All that you do

331
01:24:48,627 --> 01:24:50,003
All that you say.

332
01:24:51,213 --> 01:24:52,798
All that you eat

333
01:24:53,799 --> 01:24:55,050
everyone you meet

334
01:24:56,176 --> 01:24:58,136
All that you slight

335
01:24:59,054 --> 01:25:00,430
everyone you fight.

336
01:25:01,556 --> 01:25:03,225
All that is now

337
01:25:04,101 --> 01:25:05,852
All that is gone

338
01:25:06,728 --> 01:25:08,396
All that's to come

339
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:13,777
and everything under the sun is in tune

340
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:21,243
but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.

341
01:26:23,646 --> 01:26:26,646
[Speak to Me]

342
01:26:40,776 --> 01:26:44,322
"I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, been

343
01:26:44,113 --> 01:26:48,659
over the edge for yonks, been working me buns off for bands..."

344
01:26:48,826 --> 01:26:53,164
"I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the

345
01:26:54,332 --> 01:26:55,917
most of us...very hard to explain why you're mad, even

346
01:26:57,010 --> 01:26:58,010
if you're not mad..."

347
01:28:24,338 --> 01:28:27,338
[Breathe]

348
01:28:34,473 --> 01:28:38,352
Breathe, breathe in the air.

349
01:28:42,356 --> 01:28:46,027
Don't be afraid to care.

350
01:28:49,363 --> 01:28:53,201
Leave but don't leave me.

351
01:28:55,953 --> 01:29:00,917
Look around and choose your own ground.

352
01:29:03,503 --> 01:29:06,503
Long you live and high you fly

353
01:29:07,048 --> 01:29:10,176
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry

354
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:13,930
And all you touch and all you see

355
01:29:14,555 --> 01:29:17,850
Is all your life will ever be.

356
01:29:19,519 --> 01:29:23,147
Run, rabbit run.

357
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:30,696
Dig that hole, forget the sun,

358
01:29:33,741 --> 01:29:37,870
And when at last the work is done

359
01:29:40,581 --> 01:29:45,461
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

360
01:29:47,964 --> 01:29:50,800
For long you live and high you fly

361
01:29:51,551 --> 01:29:54,554
But only if you ride the tide

362
01:29:55,263 --> 01:29:58,432
And balanced on the biggest wave

363
01:29:58,975 --> 01:30:03,104
You race towards an early grave.

364
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:07,105
[On The Run]

365
01:30:30,673 --> 01:30:35,673
(female announcer, announcing flights at airport, including 'Rome')

366
01:31:56,551 --> 01:32:01,097
"Live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me, HaHaHaaaaaa!"

367
01:33:56,254 --> 01:33:59,254
[Time]

368
01:36:06,926 --> 01:36:11,597
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day

369
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:18,938
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.

370
01:36:21,607 --> 01:36:26,571
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town

371
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:32,990
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

372
01:36:36,247 --> 01:36:43,045
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.

373
01:36:43,754 --> 01:36:50,678
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.

374
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:58,728
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.

375
01:36:58,978 --> 01:37:06,569
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.

376
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:37,910
So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking

377
01:38:40,454 --> 01:38:45,042
Racing around to come up behind you again.

378
01:38:47,503 --> 01:38:52,175
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,

379
01:38:54,677 --> 01:38:58,931
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

380
01:39:01,893 --> 01:39:08,566
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.

381
01:39:09,442 --> 01:39:16,157
Plans that either come to nought or half a page of scribbled lines

382
01:39:16,824 --> 01:39:23,664
Hanging on in quiet desparation is the English way

383
01:39:24,207 --> 01:39:27,752
The time is gone, the song is over,

384
01:39:28,127 --> 01:39:32,215
Thought I'd something more to say.

385
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:52,860
Home, home again.

386
01:39:56,405 --> 01:40:01,077
I like to be here when I can.

387
01:40:04,497 --> 01:40:08,292
When I come home cold and tired

388
01:40:11,504 --> 01:40:16,008
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.

389
01:40:19,345 --> 01:40:22,515
Far away across the field

390
01:40:23,432 --> 01:40:26,394
The tolling of the iron bell

391
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,606
Calls the faithful to their knees

392
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:37,155
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.

393
01:40:43,953 --> 01:40:46,953
[The Great Gig in the Sky]

394
01:41:20,907 --> 01:41:25,407
"And I am not frightened of dying, any time will do, I don't mind.

395
01:41:28,989 --> 01:41:30,989
Why should I be frightened of dying?

396
01:41:31,709 --> 01:41:33,878
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime."
