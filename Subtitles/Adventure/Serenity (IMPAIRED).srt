Earth-That-Was..

2
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,926
could no longer sustain
our numbers, we were so many.

3
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,633
We found a new solar system:

4
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,905
dozens of planets
and hundreds of moons.

5
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,979
Each one terraformed,
a process taking decades...

6
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,212
to support human life.
To be new Earths.

7
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,152
The central planets
formed the Alliance.

8
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,583
Ruled by an interplanetary
parliament...

9
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,125
the Alliance was
a beacon of civilization.

10
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,922
The savage outer planets
were not so enlightened...

11
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,022
and refused Alliance control.

12
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,065
The war was devastating.

13
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,064
But the Alliance's victory
over the Independents...

14
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,003
ensured a safer universe.

15
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,402
And now, everyone
can enjoy the comfort...

16
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,774
and enlightenment
of true civilization.

17
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,880
Why were the lndependents
even fighting us?

18
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,916
Why wouldn't they look
to be more civilized?

19
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,577
I hear they're cannibals.
That's only Reavers.

20
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,780
Reavers aren't real.
Full well they are.

21
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,686
I heard they attack settlers
from space...

22
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,190
and kill them,
and wear their skins...

23
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,419
and rape them
for hours and hours--

[birds chirping]

26
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,425
It's true
that there are dangers
on the outer planets.

27
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,035
So with so many social
and medical advancements...

28
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,196
we can bring
to the lndependents...

29
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,102
why would they fight
so hard against us?

30
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,265
We meddle.

31
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,831
River?

32
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,602
People don't like
to be meddled with.

33
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,806
We tell them what to do,
what to think.

34
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,473
Don't run, don't walk.

35
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:00,441
We're in their homes
and in their heads
and we haven't the right.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,885
We're meddlesome.

37
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,453
River, we're not telling
people what to think...

38
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,288
we're just trying
to show them how.

[screaming]

40
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,660
(Dr. Mathias)
She's dreaming. Got that?
Off the charts.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,262
Scary monsters.

42
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,360
Let's amp it up.
Delcium, eight drop.

[panting]

44
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,866
See, most of our best work
is done when they're asleep.

45
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,501
We can monitor and direct
their subconscious...

46
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,272
implant suggestions.

47
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,173
It's a little startling
to see at first,
but results are spectacular.

48
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,717
Especially in this case.
River Tam is our star pupil.

49
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,151
I've heard that.

50
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,120
She'll be ideal
for defense deployment...

51
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,987
even with the side effects.

52
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,585
Tell me about them.

53
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,151
Well, obviously,
she's unstable.

54
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,027
The neural stripping
does tend to fragment...

55
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,657
their own reality matrix.

56
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:49,861
It manifests as borderline--
What use do we have...

57
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,631
for a psychic
if she's insane?

58
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,604
[groaning]
(Dr. Mathias)
She's not just a psychic.

59
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,233
Given the right trigger,
this girl is a living weapon.

60
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,904
She has her lucid periods.
We're hoping
to improve upon the....

61
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,581
I'm sorry, sir,
but I have to ask.

62
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,141
Is there a reason
for this inspection?

63
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,114
Am I making you nervous?

64
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,647
Key members of Parliament
have personally
observed this subject.

65
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,624
I was told that
the Alliance's support...

66
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,160
for the project
was unanimous.

67
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,595
The demonstration
of her power--
How is she physically?

68
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,426
Like nothing we've seen.

69
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,895
All our subjects
are conditioned for combat,
but River...

70
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,838
she's a creature
of extraordinary grace.

71
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,874
Yes.

72
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,104
She always
did love to dance.

73
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,344
River, it's Simon.

Please, it's Simon.

00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,615
It's your brother.

77
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,390
Simon.

78
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,497
They know you've come.

[machines beeping]

Excuse me...

88
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,578
no one is allowed
in the records room...

89
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,419
without my express permission.

90
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,722
Forgive me, but I prefer
to see the event alone,
without...

91
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,885
bias.

92
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,262
I need to see your clearance.
And you are right
to insist.

Apologies.

An operative of
the Parliament...

97
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,607
will, of course,
have full cooperation.

98
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,635
I'm not sure what....

99
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:51,110
I see no listing
of rank or name.
I have neither.

100
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,282
Like this facility,
I don't exist.

101
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,351
Let's talk about the Tams.

102
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,654
I assume you've
scanned the status logs--

103
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,820
River was your greatest
success. A prodigy.

104
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:05,093
A phenomenon.

105
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,495
Until her brother
walked in here
and took her from you.

106
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,397
It's not quite so simple.
I'm well aware of that.

107
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,304
There was no way
that I could--
No. No. Of course.

108
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,365
The boy spent
his entire fortune
developing...

109
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,137
the contacts
to infiltrate this place.

Gave up a brilliant future
in medicine as well.

111
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,077
It's madness.
Madness?

Have you looked
at this scan carefully,
Doctor?

At his face?

114
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,589
It's love, in point of fact.

115
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,389
Something a good deal
more dangerous.

116
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,621
Why are you here?

117
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:43,328
Because the situation
is even less simple
than you think.

118
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,264
Do you know what your sin is,
Doctor?

119
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,405
I wonder if--
It's pride.

120

Key members of Parliament
have personally
observed this subject.

121
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,013
I was told that
the Alliance's support--

122
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:06,585
"Key members of Parliament."

123
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,889
Key.

124
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,129
The minds behind
every military...

125
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,760
diplomatic,
and covert operation...

126
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,498
in the galaxy,
and you put them...

127
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,006
in a room with a psychic.

128
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,374
If there was some
classified information
that she....

129
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,447
She never spoke of it.
I don't know what it is.

130
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,573
Nor do l.

131
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,618
And judging by
her deteriorating
mental state...

132
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:33,947
I'd say we're both
better off.

133
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,648
Secrets are not my concern.

134
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,823
Keeping them is.

135
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,522
Whatever secrets
she might have
accidentally gleaned...

136
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:47,065
it's probable
she doesn't even
know she knows them.

137
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,863
That they're buried
beneath layers of psychosis.

138

You know, in certain
older civilized cultures...

when men failed as entirely...

140
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,667
as you have,
they would throw themselves...

on their swords.

142
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,641
Well, unfortunately,
I forgot to bring a sword.

143
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,584
I would put that down
right now, if I were you.

144
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,681
Would you be killed
in your sleep
like an ailing pet?

and help her
to come back to us.

162
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,450
I think I may have
a long way to travel.

163
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:28,425
Where are you hiding,
little girl?

164
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,114
[explosion]

165
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,213
[alarm buzzing]

166
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,055
What was that?
Did you see that?

167
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:33,725
Was that the primary
buffer panel?

168
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,063
It did seem to resemble--
Did the primary
buffer panel...

169
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,104
just fall off my gorramn ship
for no apparent reason?

170
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,064
Looks like.

171
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,699
I thought Kaylee checked
the entry couplings.

172
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,767
I've a clear memory of it.
If she doesn't get us...

173
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,405
extra flow
from the engine room
to offset the burn-through...

174
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,108
this landing is gonna
get pretty interesting.

175
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,117
Define "interesting."
"Oh, God,
we're all gonna die?"

176
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,812
This is the captain.
We have a little problem...

177
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,983
with our entry sequence,
so we may experience some...

178
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,425
slight turbulence
and then explode.

179
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,019
Can you shave the vector?
I'm doing it!

180
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,758
It's not enough.
Just get us on the ground!

181
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,232
That part will happen
pretty definitely.

182
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,536
We're gonna explode?
I don't wanna explode.

183
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,197
Jayne, how many weapons
you plan on taking?

184
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,173
You only got two arms.
I just get excitable...

185
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,142
as to choice.
Like to have my options open.

186
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,542
I don't plan on any shooting
taking place during this job.

187
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,208
What you plan
and what takes place ain't
ever exactly been similar.

188
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,683
No grenades.

189
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,013
We crashing again?
(Mal)
Talk to your husband.

190
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,316
Mule prepped?
Good to go, sir.

191
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,378
Just loading her up.

192
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,481
Those grenades?

193
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,957
(Jayne)
Yeah, Captain
doesn't want them.

194
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,551
Jayne, we're robbing
the place. We're not
occupying it.

195
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,024
[crashing]

196
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,464
Kaylee!

197
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,933
Kaylee, what in the sphincter
of hell are you playing at?

198
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,976
We got the primary
buffer panel coming right--

199
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,307
Everything's shiny, Captain.
Not to fret.

200
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,843
You told me
those entry couplings
would hold for another week!

201
00:11:56,916 --> 00:12:00,909
That was six months ago,
Captain.
My ship don't crash.

202
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,415
If she crashes,
you crashed her.

203
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,216
Doctor.

204
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,023
Guess who needs
to get innocked
before we hit planet-side.

205
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,292
Bit of a rockety ride.

206
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,833
Nothing to be worried about.
I'm not worried.

207
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,159
Fear is nothing to
be ashamed of, Doctor.

208
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,831
This isn't fear.
This is anger.

209
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:26,072
Well, kind of hard to tell
one from the other,
face like yours.

210
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,445
Well, I imagine
if it were fear,
my eyes would be wider.

211
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,281
I'll keep a lookout
for that next time.

212
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,647
You're not taking her.

213
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:35,585
No, no, this is not
a thing I'm interested
in talking over with--

214
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,952
She's not going with you,
and that's final.

215
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,992
I hear the words
"that's final" come
out your mouth ever again...

216
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,527
they truly will be.

217
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,659
This boat is my home.
You all are guests on it.

218
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,293
Guests?

219
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,899
Now, I earned my passage,
Captain--
(Mal)
And it's time...

220
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,767
your little sister learned
from your example.

221
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,068
I have earned my passage...

222
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,974
treating bullet holes,
knife wounds, laser burns.

223
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,807
Some jobs are more
interesting than others.

224
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,848
And you want to put my sister
in the middle of that.

225
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,076
Didn't say "want."
Said "will."

226
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,812
It's one job, Doc.
She'll be fine.

227
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,446
She's a 17-year-old girl.

228
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,417
A mentally
traumatized 17--
She's a reader.

229
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,826
Sees into the truth
of things.

230
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,624
Might see trouble
before it's coming.
Which is of use to me.

231
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,063
And that's your guiding star,
isn't it? What's of use.

232
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,125
Honestly, Doctor,
I think we may really
crash this time anyway.

233
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,529
Do you understand
what I have gone through...

234
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,039
to keep River away
from the Alliance?

235
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,668
I do, and it's a fact
we here have been courteous...

236
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,302
enough to keep
to our own selves.

237
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,507
Are you threatening to--
I look out for me and mine.

238
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,448
That don't include you
less I conjure it does.

239
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,682
You stuck a thorn
in the Alliance's paw.
That tickles me a bit.

240
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,554
But it also means
I got to step
twice as fast to avoid them...

241
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,093
and that means
turning down plenty of jobs.

242
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,526
Even honest ones.

243
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,227
Put this crew together with
the promise of work...

244
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,494
[metal clanking]
which the Alliance makes
harder every year.

245
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,798
Come a day there
won't be room
for naughty men like us...

246
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,394
to slip about at all.

247
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:02,666
This job goes south,
there well may not be another.

248
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,140
So here is us,
on the raggedy edge.

249
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,708
Don't push me,
and I won't push you.

250
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,913
[speaking Chinese]

251
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:28,955
Zoe, Wash gonna straighten
this boat out before
we get flattened?

252
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,561
(Zoe)
Like a downy feather, sir.
No one flies like my mister.

253
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,603
[engine grinding]

254
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,734
[Mal and Zoe chattering]

255
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:42,736
(Simon)
River.

256
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,015
I know.
We're going for a ride.

257
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,053
[engine revving]

258
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,026
[people chattering]

259
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,430
Hey, little one.

260
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,003
Understand your part
in all this?

261
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,404
Do you?

262
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,946
This is what I do, darling.

263
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,020
This is what I do.

264
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,991
(Mal)
Let's move, people.

265
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,763
Quit fiddling.
Want the boat running
smooth when we get back.

266
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,458
Have faith, Captain.
Not today.

267
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,368
Pair of clips
in the rear hatch.

268
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,198
We should hit town
right during Sunday worship.

269
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,604
Won't be any crowds.

270
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,973
If Fanty and Mingo
are right about the payroll...

271
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,103
this could look to be
a sunny day for us.

272
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,079
(Simon)
River, stay behind the others.

273
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:52,174
If there's fighting,
drop to the floor or run away.

274
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:55,209
It's okay
to leave them to die.

275
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:59,013
Doctor, I'm taking your sister
under my protection here.

276
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,587
If anything happens to her,
anything at all...

277
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,561
I swear to you
I will get very choked up.

278
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,621
Honestly.
There could be tears.

279
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:19,472
Don't mind
the Captain none, Simon.
I know he'll look out for her.

280
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,307
They'll be back
before you can spit.

281
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,452
Well, not that you spit.

282
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,654
(Jayne)
What are we hoping
to find here...

283
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,160
that equals
the worth of a turd?

284
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,061
(Mal)
Security payroll. Alliance
don't have the manpower...

285
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,725
to "enforce the peace"
on every outer-rim planet.

286
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,065
They hire
out to the private firms,
who will not work for credit.

287
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,573
They get paid in cashy money,
which once a month rests here.

288
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,665
Don't that lead back to
the Alliance, anyhow?

289
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,610
No private firm
would ever report the theft
of their own payroll.

290
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,842
They'd appear weak,
might lose their contract.

291
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,544
Yeah, we're as ghosts in this.
Won't but rattle the floor.

292
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:04,783
Shiny. Let's be bad guys.

293
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,916
Hands and knees and heads
bowed down! Everybody, down!

294
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,153
[woman screaming]

295
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,218
[grunting]

296
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,695
Looks like this is the place.

297
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:23,466
You all wanna
be looking very intently
at your own belly buttons.

298
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,806
I see a head start to rise,
violence is going to ensue.

299
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,907
Probably guessed we mean
to be thieving here...

300
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,143
but what we're after
is not yours.

301
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,876
So let's have
no undue fussing.

302
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,952
She's locked up.

303
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,497
[people murmuring]

304
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,203
Do you know what
the definition of a hero is?

305
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,100
Someone who gets
other people killed.

306
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,137
You can look it up later.

307
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,313
Big happy family.

308
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:42,676
[beeping]

309
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:49,216
At last.
We can retire and give up
this life of crime.

310
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,430
[metal rattling]

311
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,790
Hey!

312
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,270
You all are Browncoats, eh?
Fought for independence?

313
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,399
Petty thieving
ain't exactly soldiers' work.

314
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,775
War's long done.
We're all just folk now.
Listen up!

315
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,209
We are coming down
to empty that vault!

316
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,149
(guard)
You have to give me
your authorization password!

317
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,280
(guard)
Okay.

318
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,537
I'm telling you I heard it.
Repeater.

319
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,875
Did sound somewhat
like gun blast. Maybe
you ought run tell Lawman.

320
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:40,700
[screaming]

321
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,342
What the hell is up?
You all right?

322
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,811
What's going on?

323
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,513
Reavers.

324
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,857
The leg is good. It'll bleed
plenty and we avoid
any necessary organs.

325
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,297
I was thinking
more of a graze.

326
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,197
No, you don't want it
to look like you gave up.

327
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,462
No, I get that.

328
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,901
(Jayne)
Mal!

329
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,268
Every heist, he's got
to start yelling my name.

330
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,207
Mal! Reavers!

331
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,171
The girl's pitching a fit.
They're here
or they're coming soon.

332
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,645
Get on the Mule.

333
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,512
Does that lock
from the inside?
Yes.

334
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,075
Get everyone upstairs.
You get them down here
and you seal it.

335
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,713
As long as you got air
you don't open up,
you understand?

336
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,883
Get them inside the vault!

337
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,117
You see them?
Zoe, take the wheel!

338
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,560
(Jayne)
Anybody see them?

339
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,264
Take me with you!

340
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,999
Get back in the vault with
the others.

341
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,008
I can't stay here! Please!
It's too many. Move ahead.

342
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,509
Please!

343

Faster! Faster!
Faster would be better!

346
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:33,218
How come
they ain't blowing us
out the air?

347
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,159
They wanna run us down.
The up-close kill.

348
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,991
They want us alive
when they eat us.

349
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:44,425
Boy, sure would be nice
if we had some grenades,
don't you think?

350
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,866
[gun firing]

351
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,099
Wash, baby, can you hear me?
We're moments from air.

352
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,472
You got somebody
behind you?
Reavers.

353
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,803
Kaylee!

354
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,677
Heat her up. We got Reavers.

355
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,812
We're not gonna
get to you in time.
Keep moving, honey.

356
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,481
We're coming to you.

357
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,193
(Jayne)
Where's my clips?
(Mal)
Rear hatch.

[Jayne yelling]

361
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,181
I won't get ate!

362
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:37,922
You shoot me if they take me!
Well, don't shoot me first!

363
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,801
[grunting]

364
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,733
Get some distance on them.

365
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,608
You come to the flats,
I want you to swing round.

366
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,914
We're gonna try
a Barn Swallow.

367
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,916
Simon! Open her up!

368
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,523
(Mal)
They're closing on us!

369
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,786
Those rocks,
give them a taste.

370
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,741
(Wash)
Okay, baby,
we talked this through.

371
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,605
Talking ain't doing.

River?
I swallowed a bug.

377
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:29,323
Are you okay?
Is he okay?

378
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,390
[screeching]

379
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,013
(Wash)
We all here? What's going on?

380
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,614
Hello?

381
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,382
No casualties.

382
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,180
Anybody following?
(Wash)
Nice flying, baby.

383
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,692
That's a negative.
Clean getaway.

384
00:24:56,094 --> 00:25:00,428
Set course for Beaumonde.
First thing,
I want this body--

385
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,488
(Kaylee)
Simon!

386
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,362
[speaking Chinese]

387
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,266
You son of a whore.
I'm a hair's breadth...

388
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,669
from riddling
you with holes, Doctor.

389
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:11,197
One simple job!
She'll be fine!
She is fine!

390
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,403
Except for being still crazy,
she's a picture of health!

391
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:17,175
Wasn't for River,
we'd probably be left there.
She felt them coming.

392
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,442
(Simon)
Never again.
You understand me?

393
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,316
Seems I remember a talk about
you giving orders on my boat.

394
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,945
Well, we're off your boat.

395
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,490
Just as soon as River
gets her share of the bounty.

396
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,322
Let's not do anything hasty--
No, shiny!

397
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,186
We'll be on Beaumonde
in 10 hours' time...

398
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:34,130
you can pick up your earnings
and be on your merry.

399
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,232
Meantime, you do your job.

400
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,694
Patch up my crew.

401
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,667
He didn't lie down.

402
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,104
They never lie down.

403
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,287
(Zoe)
No, I think things will glide
a deal smoother for us...

404
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,324
without River
and Simon on board...

405
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,791
but how long
do you think they'll last?

406
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,418
Doc made his call.

407
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,484
Yeah.

408
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,394
They's as babes in a basket
when we took them in.

409
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,295
We sheltered them plenty.

410
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,699
Man has to cut loose,
learn to stand on his own.

411
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,369
Like that man back in town?

412
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,775
I had to shoot him.

413
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,835
What Reavers would've done
before they killed him--

414
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,404
I know.
That was a piece of mercy.

415
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,219
But before that,
him begging us
to bring him along.

416
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:32,322
We couldn't take the weight.
Would've slowed us down.

417
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,655
You know that for certain?
Mule won't run with five.

418
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:40,059
I should've dumped the girl?
Or you? Or Jayne?

419
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,528
Oh, Jayne....

420
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,298
You could've
tossed the payload.
Tossed the....

421
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:50,270
Zoe, I got bits falling
off my ship, I got
a crew ain't been paid...

422
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,311
and, oh, yeah, a powerful need
to eat sometime this month.

423
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,440
We tell Fanty and Mingo
we skunked the job...

424
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,504
what do think
they'll do to us?

425
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,284
We're close to gone out here.

426
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,888
We get a job,
we got to make good.

427
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,085
Sir, I don't disagree
on any particular point.

428
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:11,021
It's just...

429
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,430
in the time of war,
we would've never
left a man stranded.

430
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,566
Maybe that's why we lost.

431
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,609
That was close.

432
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,317
(Jayne)
I do not get it.

433
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,984
How's a guy get so wrong?

434
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,547
Cutting on his own face,
raping and murdering.

435
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,453
I'll kill a man
in a fair fight...

436
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,790
or if I think
he's gonna
start a fair fight...

437
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:54,162
or if he bothers me,
or if there's a woman...

438
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:59,441
or if I'm getting paid.
Mostly only when
I'm getting paid.

439
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,308
These Reavers,
the last 10 years...

440
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,214
they show up like
the boogeyman from stories.

441
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,517
Eating people alive?
Where does that get fun?

442
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,455
Shepherd Book said
they was men who just...

443
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,893
reached the edge of space,
saw a vasty nothingness...

444
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,953
and went
bibbledy over it.

445
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,087
Oh, hell.

446
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,425
I've been to the edge.

447
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:29,004
Just looked like more space.

448
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,407
I don't know.

449
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,842
It can get awful lonely
in the black.

450
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,605
Like to get addlepated
ourselves, we stay
on this boat much longer.

451
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,875
Captain will drive
us all off, one by one.

452
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,511
Just like Simon and River.

453
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,758
Just like lnara.

454
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,894
Kaylee, are you ever going
to put that capture down?

455
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,521
(Kaylee)
We got to have records
of everything, Inara.

456
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,467
A bona fide companion
entertained clients
on this very ship.

457
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:02,370
In this very bed.
Well, I can't do my work here.

458
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,465
And I don't think
the Captain approves.

459
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,134
The Captain
wants you to stay--

460
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,578
That man doesn't
know what he wants.
I don't have time to....

461

**[music playing]

Don't talk to the barkers,
talk to the captains.

464
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,752
You look the captain
in the eye.
Know who you're dealing with.

465
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,845
I wish there was....

466
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,521
You shouldn't
ought to be so clean.

467
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:01,454
It's a dead giveaway
you don't belong,
you always got to be tidy.

00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,467
Don't pay anybody in advance.

469
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,627
And don't ride in anything
with a Capissen 38 engine...

470
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,696
they fall right
out of the sky.

471
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,740
Kaylee.

472
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,349
River, do you want
to stay with them?

473
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,549
It isn't safe.

474
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,284
No.

475
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,691
I fear it isn't safe anymore.

476
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,397
For them.

477
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,104
[people clamoring]

of the massacre apparently...

the train station vault.

480
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,252
Kaylee,
this is a place of business.
We can talk about Simon when--

481
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,797
When he's
four worlds away?

482
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,197
Or the Alliance gets a hold
of him and River?

483
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,325
(Mal)
That ain't my worry.

484
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,699
I got to finish this job
and get us another one.

485
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,601
Can't do that
carrying those two.

486
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:16,906
(Kaylee)
How can you be so cold?

487
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,136
Captain didn't
make them fugitives.

488
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,405
But he could
have made them family.

489
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,377
Instead of keeping Simon
from seeing I was there.

490
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,017
When I carried such a torch,
when we could've....

491
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,419
We're going on a year now,
I ain't had nothing
twixt my nethers...

492
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,047
weren't run on batteries.

493
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,354
Oh, God! I can't know that!

494
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:37,584
I could stand
to hear a little more.

495
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,924
If you had a care
for anybody's heart--

496
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,625
You knew
he was gonna leave.

497
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,496
We never been
but a way station
to those two.

498
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,195
And how do you know
what he feels?

499
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,239
He's got River to worry on
but he still could've
shown you....

500
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,570
If I truly wanted
someone bad enough...

501
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:54,237
wouldn't be a thing
in the 'verse could stop
me from going to her.

502
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,407
Tell that to lnara.

503
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,885
Domestic troubles?

504
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,918
Domestic troubles?

505
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,149
'Cause we don't
wanna interrupt.

506
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,387
A man should keep
his house in order.

507
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,928
Fanty. Mingo.

508
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,328
He's Mingo.
He's Fanty.
You're Mingo.

509
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,626
How is it you always know?
Fanty's prettier.

510
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,734
Feel to do some business?

511
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,668
Endeavors.

512
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,682
(Mingo)
Quite a crew you've got.

513
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,848
Yeah, they're
a fine bunch of reubens.

514
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:43,325
How you keep them
on that crap boat,
is the subject...

515
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,191
of much musing
between me and Fanty.

516
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,595
We go on and on.
So I'm noticing.

517
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,794
Is there a problem
we don't know of?

518
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,060
You got a sweet take
kissing your foot.

519
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,231
How's about you take your 25%,
we can talk about
the next job?

520
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,298
Well, our end is 40,
precious.

521
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,344
My muscular buttocks it's 40.
It is...

Find anyone around
going cheaper....

524
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,645
Find anyone
around going near...

525
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,210
a sorry lot like you
in the first instance.

526
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,017
(Fanty)
You're unpredictable, Mal.

527
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,091
You run
when you ought to fight.

528
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,058
Fight when you ought to deal.

some storytelling to do.

What in the hell happened
back there?

if anyone was killed?
It's likely.

I know she meant to kill me
before the Doc put her out.

559

Which, how exactly
does that work anyhow?

It's a safe word.

The people who helped me
break River out...

562

had intel that River
and the other subjects
were being...

embedded with
behavioral conditioning.

They taught me a safe word...

in case something happened.
Not sure I get it.

566

It's a phrase
that makes her fall asleep.

If I speak the words--
Don't say it!

568

It only works on her, Jayne.

569

Well, now I know that.

what that something might be?

They never said what--
And you never did ask.

Get your hands off--

574
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:59,836
Eight months. Eight months,
you had her on my boat...

575
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,468
knowing full well
she could go monkeyshit...

576
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:03,035
at the wrong word.
You never said a thing.

577
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,981
I brought her out here
so they couldn't get to her.

578
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,816
I don't even know what they--
My ship!

My crew!

580
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,279
You had a gorramn
time bomb living with us!

when she wakes up?

The girl?

00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,326
Or the weapon?

584
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,999
I thought
she was getting better.

585
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,093
And I thought
they was getting off!

586
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,873
Didn't we have an intricate
plan how they was gonna
be not here anymore?

587
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,035
We couldn't leave them now.
(Jayne)
No, now that...

00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,545
she's a killer woman
we ought be bringing
her tea and dumplings.

589
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,111
In earnest, Mal,
why'd you bring her back on?

590

we're gonna have
to put a bullet to her.

It's crossed my mind.

593
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,838
Can I make a suggestion
that doesn't involve
violence...

594
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,937
or is this the wrong crowd?
Honey.

595

We're flying a lot blinder
than usual here.

We need to get our bearings.

597
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,286

to Mr. Universe.

You think
you're in a hot place?

603
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:58,119
That's what we're looking
to learn. Is there
any follow up, a newswave?

604
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,494
There is no news.
There's the truth
of the signal.

605
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:05,597
What I see. And, there's
the puppet theater...

606
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,000
the Parliament jesters foist
on the somnambulant public.

607
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,442
Well, what about this?
Did this make
the puppet theater?

608
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,805
No, sir.
And no lawforce flags, either.

609
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,813
I had to go into
the security feed direct.

610
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,782
You can do that?
Can't stop the signal, Mal.

611
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,351
Everything goes somewhere,
and I go everywhere.

612
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,455
Security feeds
are a traipse to access...

613
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:27,184
and I wasn't the first one in.

614
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,557
This has prints on it.
So somebody else
has been fed this.

615
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:34,522
Zoe, you sultry minx,
stop falling in love with me.

616
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,498
You're just gonna
embarrass yourself.

617
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,001
I have a commitment
to my Lovebot.

618
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,474
It was a very beautiful
ceremony. Lenore wrote
her own vows...

619
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:49,505
I cried like a baby,
a hungry, angry baby.

620
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,416
And she falls asleep.
Which, she would be sleepy.

621
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,879
Can you go back?

622
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,820
See if anybody spoke with her
before she acted up.

623
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,017
Made any kind
of contact with her.

624
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,925
**[music playing]

625
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,293
Miranda.
"Miranda"?

626
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:11,634
Go back further.

627
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,125
No.

628
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,628
(Mal)
Please.

629
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:24,206
Mal, you're very smart.

630
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,881
Someone is talking to her.
The oaty bar?

631
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,082
Subliminal.

632
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,785
It's a subliminal message,
broadwaved to trigger her.

633
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,227
I've been seeing this code
pop up all over,
the last few weeks.

634
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,188
It's Alliance
and it's high military.

635
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:47,661
They have gone
to enormous trouble
to find your little friend.

636
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,574
And found her, they have.

637
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,600
Do you all know
what it is you're carrying?

638
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,943
They're afraid of me.

639
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,382
I'm sorry.
They should be.

640
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:13,119
But I'll show them. Oh, God.

641
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,726
It's okay. Hey, it's okay.

642
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,264
Show me off like a dog.

643
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,963
Old men covered in blood.

644
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,839
It never touched them,
but they're drowning in it.

645
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,677
I don't know what I'm saying.
I never know what I'm saying.

646
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,082
In the Maidenhead,
you said something.

647
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,420
When you were triggered,
do you remember?

648
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:43,119
The Captain saw you
say something on the feed.

649
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,159
Miranda.

650
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:48,754
Miranda.

651
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,329
Ask her.

652
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,168
Who is Miranda?

653
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:03,678
Am I talking to Miranda now?

654
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:07,606
No.

655
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,578
Not right.

656
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:17,416
But I think
when they triggered you...

657
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,230
it somehow brought this up.

658
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,857
This memory.
It isn't mine.

659
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,861
The memory, it isn't mine.

660
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,836
And I shouldn't have
to carry it. It isn't mine.

661
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,504
Don't make me sleep again.
I won't.

662
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,364
I won't.

663
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,667
Put a bullet to me.

664
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,307
Bullet in the brainpan,
squish.

665
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,047
Don't say that. Not ever.

666
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,317
We'll get through this.

667
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,856
Things are going to get
much, much worse.

668
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,701
[birds chirping]

669

[water running]

670
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,182
(Mal)
Thanks for taking us in again,
Shepherd.

671
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,184
(Shepherd)
You got a plan?

672
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,287
Hiding ain't a plan?

673
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,018
It'll do you for a spell.

674
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,219
And the folks
here'll be glad
of the extra coin.

675
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,319
But the Alliance
will be coming.

676
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:02,123
They're after this girl
with a powerful will.

677
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,767
I look to hear the tromp
of their boots any moment.

678
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,230
[bird hooting]

679
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,536
You won't.

680
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,605
This isn't
a palms-up military run, Mal.

681
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,809
No reports broadwaved...

682
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,709
no warrants.

683
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,584
Much as they want her,
they want her hid.

684
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,087
That means closed file.

685
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,456
Means an operative.

686
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,552
Which is trouble
you've not known.

687
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,861
I could have left her there.

688
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,462
I had an out.

689
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:41,396
Hell, I had every reason
in the 'verse...

690
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:43,633
to leave her lay
and haul anchor.

691
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,336
It's not your way, Mal.

692
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,108
I have a way?

693
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,842
That better than a plan?

694
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:55,647
Only one thing is gonna
walk you through this, Mal.

695
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:58,610
Belief.

696
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,752
You know I always look
to you for counsel...

697
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,021
but sermons make me
sleepy, Shepherd.

698
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,061
I ain't looking for help
from on high.

699
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,529
That's a long wait
for a train don't come.

700
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:15,561
When I talk about belief,
why do you always assume
I'm talking about God?

701
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,707
They'll come at you sideways.

702
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,949
It's how they think.
It's how they move.

703
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,952
Sidle up and smile.
Hit you where you're weak.

704
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,525
Sort of man
they're like to send
believes hard.

705
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,753
Kills and never asks why.

706
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,702
It's of interest to me
how much you seem
to know about that world.

707
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,898
I wasn't born
a Shepherd, Mal.

708
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,237
Have to tell me
about that sometime.

709
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,365
[sighing]

710
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:55,635
No, I don't.

711
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,643
(woman)
River?

712
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:01,741
[birds chirping]

713
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,480
River, you look tired.

714
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:07,553
I think everybody's
a little tired by now.
Why don't we all lie down.

715
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:11,561
A little peace and quiet
will make everything better.

716
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:14,288
River. Do as you're told.
No.

717
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,958
It's going to be fine.
Lie down.
No.

718
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,600
(man)
Cut them down.

719
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,242
What?
(Wash)
Mal! You up?

720
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,741
I got a wave. I'm gonna
bounce it down to you.

721
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,177
Inara.

722
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,990
I.... Is this a bad time?

723
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,020
No, this...

724
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:46,756
good as any.

725
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:49,994
How's your world?
Cold. It's autumn here.

726
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,331
Still at the Training House?

727
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:54,793
[clearing throat]

728
00:47:56,306 --> 00:48:00,436
So, what occasions the wave?
Not that to see you ain't....

729
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:05,406
Well, you look very fine.
Oh. Thank you.

730
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,579
(Mal)
So, what was the....

731
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:13,318
I guess we're having
something of a problem
here with the locals.

732
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,984
And, I thought maybe--
You could use a gun hand?

733
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:20,223
I'm hoping not.
But if you happen
to be close at all, you....

734
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:24,357
The crew could take
your ease here for a while.
And there'd be payment.

735
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,235
Well, it would be....
I mean, I'd like to.

736
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,104
Kaylee's been missing you
something fierce.

737
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,841
(all)
Oh, man.
I miss her, too.

738
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,009
I even miss
my shuttle, occasionally.

739
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,177
Yeah, you left, um....

740
00:48:43,553 --> 00:48:45,282
Got some of your
stuff in a trunk.

741
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:46,879
I never did get a chance
to drop it off.

742
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:51,223
I didn't mean to leave stuff.
I didn't look
through the stuff.

743
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,758
I just....
Just sundries I expect.

744
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,466
So I'll send you a wave,
soon as I can.

745
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,364
Thank you.

746
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:14,182
Inara, nice to see
her again.

747
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,519
So, trap?
Trap.

748
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,718
We going in?
Only but a few hours out.

749
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,318
Yeah, but, remember the part
where it's a trap?

750
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:27,963
If that's the case,
then lnara's already
caught in it.

751
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,022
She wouldn't
set us up willing.

752
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,134
Might be we got a shot
at seeing who's
turning these wheels.

753
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,227
We go in.

754
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,637
But how can you be sure
lnara don't just
wanna see you?

755
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,975
Sometimes people
have feelings.

756
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:43,169
I'm referring here to people.

757
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,041
You all were watching,
I take it.

758
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,715
Yes.
Did you see us fight?

759
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,512
No.
Trap.

760
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:04,331
We're about 70 miles
from the Training House,
and nobody on radar.

761
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,869
If the Alliance is about,
they're laying low.

762
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,097
They're about.

763
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,196
Find us a home.
I'll take the shuttle
a little closer.

764
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,934
Zoe, ship is yours.

765
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,534
Remember. If anything
happens to me...

766
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,340
or if you don't hear from me
within the hour...

767
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,677
you take this ship
and you come
and you rescue me.

768
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:19,738
What?

769
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,682
Risk my ship?
I mean it.

770
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,850
It's cold out there.
And I don't wanna get left.

771
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:46,073
Dear Buddha,
please bring me a pony,
and a plastic rocket, and--

772
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,043
Mal! What are you
doing here?

773
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:49,839
Well, you invited me.

774
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,473
I never thought for a second
you'd be stupid enough
to come.

775
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,414
Well, that makes you
kind of a tease, doesn't it?

776
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,418
You knew my invitation
wasn't on the level.

777
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:59,455
Which led me to conclude
that you must be
in some trouble.

778
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,286
I'm fine. I'm giddy.

779
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,792
For a woman schooled
in telling a man
what he wants to hear...

780
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,352
you ain't much of a liar.
Mal, you cannot
handle this man.

781
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:14,597
I have to say, Captain...

782
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,538
I'm impressed that you
would come for her yourself.

783
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,968
And that you would make it
this far, in that outfit.

784
00:51:22,145 --> 00:51:24,443
I can be very graceful
when I need to.

785
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:25,879
I've no doubt.

786
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,980
What are you doing?
I'm praying for you, Mal.

787
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,483
She's very thoughtful.

788
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,892
But I mean it when I say
I've no intent to harm you.

789
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,287
Speak your piece.

790
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,627
I think you're
beginning to understand...

791
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,665
how dangerous River Tam is.

792
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,830
She is a mite unpredictable.

793
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,002
Mood swings, of a sort.

794
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,595
It's worse than you know.
It usually is.

795
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:53,302
That girl will
rain destruction down
on you and your ship.

796
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:57,475
She is an albatross, Captain.

797
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,376
Way I remember it...

798
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,816
albatross was
a ship's good luck,
till some idiot killed it.

799
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:06,049
Yes, I've read a poem.
Try not to faint.

800
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:08,421
I've seen your war record.

801
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,952
I know how you must feel about
the Alliance.

802
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,424
You really don't.
Fair to say.

803
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,998
But I have to hope
you understand,
you can't beat us.

804
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,797
I got no need to beat you.

805
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:22,737
I just want to go my way.
And you can do that...

806
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,599
once you let me take
River Tam back home.

807
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,838
No, no. You're working
this deal all crabbed.

808
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,645
You got to open with payment.
That is a trap.

809
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:39,346
I offer money,
you'll play the man of honor
and take umbrage.

810
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,184
I ask you to do what is right,
you'll play the brigand.

811
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,784
I have no stomach for games.

812
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,286
I already know
you will not see reason.

813
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,922
The Alliance wanted to
show me a reason...

814
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,194
they shouldn't have sent
an assassin.

815
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,534
I have a warship
in deep orbit, Captain.

816
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:04,738
We locked on
to Serenity's pulse beacon
the moment you hit atmo.

817
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,906
I can speak a word
and send a missile...

818
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:09,679
to that exact location
inside of three minutes.

819
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:10,913
You do that...

820
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,889
you'd best make peace
with your dear
and fluffy lord.

821
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:19,890
Pulse beacon.

822
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:24,122
Advice from an old tracker.
You want to find someone,
use your eyes.

823
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,932
How long do you think
you can really run from us?

824
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,631
I never credited
the Alliance with
an overabundance of brains.

825
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,867
And if you're
the best they got--
Captain Reynolds...

826
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:34,740
I should tell you,
so that you don't
waste your time...

827
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:38,770
you can't make me angry.
Please, spend
an hour with him.

828
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,313
I want to resolve this
like civilized men.

829
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,286
I'm not threatening you.

830
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:47,122
I'm unarmed.
Good.

831
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,384
[gun firing]

832
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,288
I am, of course,
wearing full body armor.

833
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,696
I am not a moron.
(lnara)
Wait, just let--

834
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,256

What, no backup?

841
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:30,093
Making an awful ruckus.
They'll come
when they're needed.

842
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,599
I'd start whistling.

843
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,898
Captain, what do you think
is going to happen here?

844
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,334
[both grunting]

Nothing here is what it seems.
He isn't the plucky hero.

850
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,849
The Alliance isn't
some evil empire.
This is not the grand arena.

851
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,721
And that's not incense.

852
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,324
[beeping]

853
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:40,930
Sir, can you hear me?

854
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,529
Just a flash bomb. Go. Go!

855
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:46,334
[lnara and Mal grunting]

856
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:52,476
What have you done
to my shuttle?
It's not your shuttle.

857
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,714
Head east. Keep her low.

858
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,476
[engine revving]

859
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,364
Okay, forget
the pulse beacon.

860
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,596
There must be another way
to track the ship.

861
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,070
Get a read
on the nav. sat.

862
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:18,699
It's a registered transport,
you must be able to locate.

863
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,764
(ensign)
Sir?

864
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,708
Yes, have you found
a nav. sat. trajectory?

865
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,212
Sir, we found seven.

866
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,684
(Inara)
We've every reason
to be afraid.

867
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,082
Why, 'cause this guy
beat up Mal?
That ain't so hard.

868
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,685
He didn't beat me up.
Nobody said that.

869
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,526
Because he's a believer.

870
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:46,202
He's intelligent, methodical,
and devout in his belief...

871
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:48,669
that killing River
is the right thing to do.

872
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,298
So no hope
of a reward, huh?

873
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,678
Did he say anything
about a Miranda?

874
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:57,537
What is that?

875
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,014
Don't know who or what,
but it's on River's mind.

876
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,074
Conjure it might be the reason
they're after her.

877
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:05,053
You think maybe it poses
some kind of threat
to the Alliance?

878
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:06,486
Do we care?

879
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,585
Are we caring about that?

880
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:11,320
You dumb-ass hogs,
the only people
she's a threat to is...

881
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,884
us on this boat.

882
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,793
Look, we get back
to Haven...

883
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:15,888
in a few
hours' time.
Oh, yeah.

884
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,262
Hiding under
the Shepherd's skirts...

885
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,357
that's a manful scheme.

886
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,460
You wanna run this ship?
Yes.

887
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:23,335
Well, you can't.

888
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:26,268
Do a damn sight
better job than you.

889
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,810
Getting us lashed over
a couple of strays.

890
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,036
No offense, Doc.
I think it's
noble as a grape...

891
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,342
the way you look to River.

892
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,883
But she ain't my sister
and she ain't your crew.

893
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,317
Oh, and neither is she
exactly helpless.

894
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,212
So, where's it writ
that we got to lay down
our lives for her?

895
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,848
Which is what you've
steered us toward.

896
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,654
I didn't start this.

897
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,818
No, that's right.

898
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:50,326
Alliance starts the war,
and then you volunteer.

899
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,963
Battle of Serenity, Mal.

900
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:57,268
Besides Zoe here, how many....
Hey, I'm talking at you.

901
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,337
How many men in your platoon
came out of there alive?

902
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,711
You wanna leave this room.

903
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,284
Damn right, I do.

904
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,656
This isn't
the war, Mal.

905
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,764
You telling me that
'cause you think I don't know?

906
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,963
You came to the Training House
looking for a fight.

907
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,938
I came looking for you.

908
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,710
I just want to know
who I'm dealing with.

909
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,439
I've seen too many versions
of you to be sure.

910
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,946
I start fighting a war,
I guarantee
you'll see something new.

911
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,353
We'll get off.

912
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:52,053
River and I will
get off at Haven.

913
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:53,891
We'll find some--
Nobody's saying that.

914
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,794
Nobody besides Jayne
is saying that.

915
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:56,854
Mal.

916
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:02,429
I got no answers
for you, lnara.
I got no rudder.

917
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,474
Wind blows northerly,
I go north.
That's who I am.

918
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:08,102
Now, maybe that ain't
a man to lead,
but they have to follow.

919
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,269
So you wanna tear me down...

920
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,506
do it inside your own mind.
I'm not trying
to tear you down.

921
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,173
But you fog things up.

922
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,678
You always have.

923
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,753
You spin me about.

924
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,119
I wish like hell
you was elsewhere.

925
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,421
I was.
