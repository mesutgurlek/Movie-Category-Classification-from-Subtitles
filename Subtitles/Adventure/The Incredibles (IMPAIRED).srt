[interviewer] Mr. Incredible...
Do you have a secret identity?

7
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,474
Every superhero has a secret identity.
I don't know a single one who doesn't.

8
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,745
Who wants the pressure
of being super all the time?

9
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,687
Of course I have a secret identity.

10
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:59,054
Can you see me in this
at the supermarket? Come on.

Who'd want to go shopping as Elastigirl,
know what I mean?

12
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,592
Superladies, they're always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

13
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:11,000
Think it'll strengthen
the relationship or something.

about your mild-mannered alter ego."

I mean, you tell me you're

that's all right with me.
I'm good. I'm good.

No matter how many times
you save the world,

00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,953
it always manages to get back
in jeopardy again.

19
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,482
Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know?

20
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,928
For a little bit. I feel like the maid.
"I just cleaned up this mess.

21
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,363
Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

22
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,401
[interviewer] I could get to that point.

Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know?

25
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,366
Relax a little and raise a family.

00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,786
has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.

157
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:34,230
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

158
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,292
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions",

159
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,702
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

160
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,070
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

161
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,836
[lawyer] My client has no comment.

162
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:48,243
[announcer] Another suit was filed
by victims of the el train accident.

163
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,750
Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.

164
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:56,186
And opened the flood gates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.

165
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:01,215
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

166
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,262
Time for them to join us, or go away.

167
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,265
[announcer] Under public pressure,
and the financial burden

168
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,801
of an ever mounting series of lawsuits,

169
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,771
the government quietly initiated
the superhero relocation program.

170
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,468
The supers were granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions,

171
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:21,912
in exchange for the promise
to never again resume hero work.

172
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,676
Where are they now?

173
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,049
They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.

174
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,422
Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.

175
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,388
Denied? You're denying my claim?

176
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,030
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

177
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,533
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

178
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:45,798
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17.

179
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,772
- It states clearly...
- [stammering] I can't pay for this.

180
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,638
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

181
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,304
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

182
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,677
We're now officially moved in.

183
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,545
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

184
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,982
The last three years
don't count because...

185
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,045
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

186
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,183
- [Helen] Why do we have so much junk?
- Listen, I've got a client.

187
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,285
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

188
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,762
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

189
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,995
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

190
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:20,061
[sobbing] I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

191
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,403
I don't know what I'll do.

192
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,340
[blows nose loudly]

193
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,408
[sobbing]

194
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,512
All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

195
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,249
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

196
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:42,625
[whispering] Norma Wilcox. W-I-L-C-O-X.
On the third floor. But I can't.

197
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:46,358
I also do not advise you
to fill out and file a WS2475 form

198
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,798
with our legal department
on the second floor.

199
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,497
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

200
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,062
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

201
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,770
- Oh, thank you, young man.
- [shouting] Sorry. I know you're upset!

202
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,711
- [whispering] Pretend to be upset.
- [sobbing]

203
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,215
Parr!

204
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,753
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

205
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,085
Someone broke
into their house, Mr. Huph.

206
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,092
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

207
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,994
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping lnsuricare in the black.

208
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,623
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

209
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:24,726
to every Harry Hardluck and Sally
Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

210
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,898
[over PA] Morning break is over.
Morning break is over.

211
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,514
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

212
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,946
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

213
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,184
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

214
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,657
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

215
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,786
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

216
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,661
Well... not really. No.

217
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,858
Actually, not.

218
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,993
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

219
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,629
I hid a camera.
Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

220
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,707
See? You see?

221
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,408
You don't see it?

222
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,716
He moves! Right there!

223
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:18,382
Wait, wait! Right there!

224
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,152
Right as I'm sitting down!

225
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,989
I don't know how he does it,

226
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,359
but there's no tack before he moves

227
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,560
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

228
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,233
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

229
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,399
[screaming] This little rat is guilty!

230
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,935
You and your son can go now, Mrs. Parr.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

231
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,982
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

232
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,678
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

233
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:56,192
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

234
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,790
We need to find a better outlet.
A more... constructive outlet.

235
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,858
Maybe I could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

236
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,063
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

237
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:10,768
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

238
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,107
Dashiell Robert Parr,

239
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,341
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

240
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,542
The last thing you need is temptation.

241
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,018
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

242
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,317
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

243
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,722
Right now, honey,
the world just wants us to fit in,

244
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,522
and to fit in, we just gotta be
like everybody else.

245
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,291
Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

246
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:36,300
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

247
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,996
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

248
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,577
[bell rings]

249
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,011
[boy] Rydinger, where you headed?

250
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,649
- [girl] Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

251
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,849
- Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?
- That's kind of funny.

252
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,220
Hey, Tony, do you play football?

253
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,229
[boy] Tony, I thought we were
gonna go swimming.

254
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:10,969
He looked at me.

255
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,232
- [car horn honking]
- [Dash] Come on, Violet!

256
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,373
[horns honking, people yelling]

257
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,885
[car rattling]

258
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,919
[groans]

259
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,165
[muttering] Darn kids.
Sitting on the driveway...

260
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,595
Oh, great.

261
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,303
[unintelligible muttering]

262
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,597
[Helen and Jack-Jack cooing]

263
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,603
Mom.

264
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:27,371
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

265
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,880
You make weird faces, honey.

266
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:33,509
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

267
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,486
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes!

268
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,456
Bob, could you help
the carnivore cut his meat.

269
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:45,022
Dash, you have something you
wanna tell your father about school?

270
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:48,897
- [nervously] Well, we dissected a frog.
- Dash got sent to the office again.

271
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,527
- [distracted] Good. Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

272
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,766
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

273
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,705
- What?! What for?
- Nothing.

274
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,710
He put a tack on the teacher's chair...
during class.

275
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,440
Nobody saw me.
You could barely see it on the tape.

276
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,711
They caught you on tape
and you still got away with it? Whoa!

277
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,275
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

278
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,945
We are not encouraging this.

279
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,115
I'm not, I'm just asking how fast...

280
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,886
- Honey!
- [crash]

281
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,130
Great. First the car,
now I gotta pay to fix the table...

282
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,893
What happened to the car?

283
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,932
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

284
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,263
So, how about you, Vi?
How was school?

285
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,138
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

286
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,873
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

287
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,916
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

288
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,713
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

289
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,778
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

290
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,381
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

291
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,859
- Honey!
- [Bob] Kids! Listen to your mother.

292
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,621
She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.

293
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:55,223
That's it!

294
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,494
Stop it!

295
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:01,067
- [Dash] You're gonna be toast!
- [Helen] Stop running in the house.

296
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,968
[Helen] Sit down!

297
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,605
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

298
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,272
You sit down! You sit down!

299
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,713
Violet!

300
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,981
- [shouting in background]
- [Bob muttering]

301
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,587
"Simon J. Paladino,

302
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:23,754
longtime advocate of superhero rights,
is missing"?

303
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,596
- Gazerbeam.
- [Helen] Bob! It's time to engage.

304
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,033
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

305
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,697
- I need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

306
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,933
Okay. I'm intervening!

307
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,441
[all shouting]

308
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,739
Violet, let go of your brother.

309
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,369
[Jack-Jack] Hello?

310
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,976
[Bob] Get the door.

311
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,145
- Hey, Lucius!
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

312
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,849
- lce of you to drop by.
- Ha! Never heard that one before.

313
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,392
- [gargling] Lucius!
- [Lucius] Whoa!

314
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,624
- [Lucius] Ha, ha.
- [Dash] Oh!

315
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,292
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

316
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,892
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

317
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,201
Bowling night.
Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.

318
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,969
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

319
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:18,044
Don't think you've avoided
talking about the principal's office.

320
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,346
Your father and I
are still gonna discuss it.

321
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,354
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

322
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,356
Other kids don't have superpowers.

323
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,951
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

324
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,723
What does anyone
in this family know about normal?

325
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,756
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

326
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,793
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

327
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,999
- [Jack-Jack laughing]
- [Dash] Lucky.

328
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,566
I meant about being normal.

329
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,902
[laughter]

330
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,971
[Lucius] So now I'm in deep trouble.

331
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,142
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

332
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:56,449
Somehow I managed to find cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

333
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,513
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

334
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,493
He starts this prepared speech
about how feeble I am compared to him.

335
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,862
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

336
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,366
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

337
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,597
[Lucius] I mean, the guy has me
on a platter, and he won't shut up.

338
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:16,266
- [radio] Municiberg, we have a 23-56...
- 23-56, what is that?

339
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,605
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

340
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,611
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

341
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,204
Tell you the truth,
I'd rather go bowling.

342
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,776
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

343
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,411
Just to shake things up.

344
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:34,152
[Mirage] He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

345
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,592
They're just talking.

346
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,790
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

347
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,163
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

348
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:45,829
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

349
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:49,396
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

350
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,671
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

351
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:56,305
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

352
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,611
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

353
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,482
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

354
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,954
- [radio] We have a report on a fire...
- A fire. We're close!

355
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:07,651
- [yelling] Yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

356
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:09,318
[hooting]

357
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,086
[Bob] Fire! Yeah!

358
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,368
- [Lucius] Is that everybody?
- [Bob] Yeah.

359
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,175
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

360
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,545
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

361
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,743
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

362
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,151
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

363
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,621
You can't run out.
You can use water in the air.

364
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,490
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

365
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,496
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

366
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,692
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling!

367
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,099
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

368
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,011
[coughing, moaning]

369
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,283
[Bob] Yeah.
[coughing]

370
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,189
Uh-oh.

371
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,851
Oh, good.

372
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,494
- [alarm sounds]
- [Lucius groans]

373
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,552
That ain't right.

374
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:25,360
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

375
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,927
Freeze!

376
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:32,869
Freeze!

377
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:35,777
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze!

378
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,714
I'm just getting a drink.

379
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:47,718
- You've had your drink. Now...
- I know. I know. Freeze.

380
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,593
[police radio chatter]

381
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,287
Police officers!

382
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,105
[Lucius] That was way too close.

383
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,874
We are not doing that again.

384
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,647
[over radio] Verify you want
to switch targets? Over.

385
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:18,280
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

386
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,716
[keys jingling]

387
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,489
[humming]

388
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,515
- I thought you'd be back by 11.
- I said I'd be back later.

389
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,248
I assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all...

390
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,315
- ...you'd be "back later".
- Well, I'm back, okay?

391
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,093
Is this rubble?

392
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,660
[with mouth full] It was just a little
workout. Just to stay loose.

393
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:10,265
You know how I feel about that.
Darn you! We can't blow cover again.

394
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,436
- The building was coming down anyway.
- What?

395
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,173
You knocked down a building?

396
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,148
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

397
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,707
Have you been listening
to the police scanner again?

398
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,948
I performed a public service.
You act like that's a bad thing.

399
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,455
It is a bad thing, Bob!

400
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,654
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

401
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,663
It's better than acting like
they didn't happen!

402
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:35,131
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

403
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,829
is what's happening now, Bob.
And you are missing this!

404
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,067
I can't believe you don't want to go to
your own son's graduation.

405
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,701
It's not a graduation.
He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

406
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,677
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

407
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,476
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

408
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,483
but if someone is exceptional...

409
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,815
This is not about you, Bob.
It's about Dash.

410
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,719
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him actually compete.

411
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,587
- Let him go out for sports!
- I will not be made the enemy!

412
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,526
- You know why we can't do that.
- Because he'd be great.

413
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,620
This is not about you!

414
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,724
All right, Dash.
I know you're listening. Come on out.

415
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,100
Vi? You, too, young lady.

416
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,537
Come on. Come on out.

417
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,304
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

418
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,140
[Vi] Pretty loud discussion.

419
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,841
But that's okay. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

420
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:30,786
- We're united, uh, against forces of...
- Pigheadedness?

421
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,415
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

422
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,823
Everything's okay.
Go back to bed. It's late.

423
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:38,021
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

424
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,554
In fact, we should all be in bed.

425
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,300
[sighs]

426
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,937

[on phone] Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...

429
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,979
[Huph] Haven't you got him yet?
Where is he?

430
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,647
[PA] Mr. Huph would like to talk
to you in his office.

431
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,816
- Now?
- Now.

432
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,590
[announcement on PA]

433
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,607
Sit down, Bob.

434
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:36,310
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

435
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,819
- Ask me why.
- Okay. Why?

436
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,859
Why what? Be specific, Bob.

437
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,587
Why are you unhappy?

438
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,493
Your customers make me unhappy.

439
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:47,292
What, you've gotten complaints?

440
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:48,855
Complaints I can handle.

441
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:52,562
What I can't handle is your customers'
inexplicable knowledge

442
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:56,596
of lnsuricare's inner workings!
They're experts. Experts, Bob!

443
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,803
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

444
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,346
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!

445
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,144
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

446
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:09,550
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that I answer no.

447
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,852
- We're supposed to help people.
- [yelling] Help our people!

448
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,789
Starting with our stockholders.

449
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,259
Who's helping them out, huh?

450
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:23,528
[Huph] You know, Bob, a company...

451
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,228
Is like an enormous clock.

452
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:29,330
...is like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

453
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:34,071
[Huph] It only works if all
the little cogs mesh together.

454
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:39,549
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

455
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:45,317
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

456
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,759
[chuckling] I'm being metaphorical, Bob.
Know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

457
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,523
Bob?

458
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:54,792
Bob? Look at me
when I'm talking to you, Parr.

459
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:57,960
- That man out there, he needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

460
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,903
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He is getting mugged!

461
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,702
- Well, let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be right back.

462
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,302
Stop right now or you're fired!

463
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,975
Close the door.

464
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:16,082
Get over here, now.

465
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,386
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

466
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:28,296
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

467
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,994
You were this close to losing your...

468
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,531
[moaning]

469
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,402
Uh-oh.

470
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,543
[over PA] Please report to
operating room 722 immediately.

471
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,924
- How is he?
- He'll live.

472
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,654
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- You think?

473
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,492
- What can I say, Rick?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

474
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,555
- Someone was in trouble.
- Always.

475
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,261
- I had to do something.
- Every time you say that,

476
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,496
it's a month and a half
of trouble for me.

477
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,903
Hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer's dollars.

478
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,567
- I know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

479
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,771
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

480
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,406
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

481
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,509
We can't keep doing this. We appreciate
what you did in the old days,

482
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,919
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

483
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:32,654
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you,
you know, for old times' sake.

484
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,858
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

485
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:38,164
I'll make it work. Thanks.

486
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,227
Take care of yourself.

487
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,645
[Bob] What are you waiting for?

488
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:58,746
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

489
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,719
[sighs] Me, too, kid.

490
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,263
[sighs]

491
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,793
[door swings shut]

492
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,732
[groans]

493
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,115
Huh?

494
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,195
"Hold still"?

495
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,631
[computer] Match: Mr. Incredible.

496
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:52,070
Room is secure. Commence message.

497
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:56,512
[Mirage] Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Yes, we know who you are.

498
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,550
Rest assured,
your secret is safe with us.

499
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,053
My name is Mirage.
We have something in common.

500
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:07,080
According to the government,
neither of us exist.

501
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:11,390
Please pay attention, as this message
is classified and will not be repeated.

502
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,226
I represent a top secret division
of the government,

503
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,733
designing and testing
experimental technology,

504
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,793
and we have need
of your unique abilities.

505
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:22,135
Something happened
at our testing facility.

506
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,605
- [Helen] Honey!
- Huh? What?

507
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,041
- [Helen] Dinner's ready.
- Okay.

508
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,374
...it is contained
within an isolated area,

509
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,610
it threatens to cause incalculable
damage to itself and our facilities,

510
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,482
jeopardizing hundreds
of millions of dollars...

511
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,145
[Helen] Is someone in there?

512
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:40,486
- It's the TV, trying to watch.
- Because of its sensitive nature...

513
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,891
- [Helen] Stop. It's time for dinner.
- One minute!

514
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,864
If you accept, your payment will be
triple your current annual salary.

515
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,800
Call the number on the card.
Voice-matching will ensure security.

516
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,737
The supers aren't gone, Mr. Incredible.
You're still here.

517
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,766
You can still do great things. Or...

518
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:03,075
...you can listen to police scanners.
Your choice.

519
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,012
You have 24 hours to respond.

520
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,675
Think about it.

521
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:41,515
[beeping]

522
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,686
[computer] This message
will self-destruct.

523
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:47,725
Uh-oh.

524
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,727
[muffled explosion, coughing]

525
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:54,629
[fire alarm beeping]

526
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,894
[family shouting in another room]

527
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,272
You are one distracted guy.

528
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,405
Am I? I don't mean to be.

529
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:16,215
I know you miss being a hero
and your job is frustrating.

530
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:20,986
I just want you to know how much it
means to me that you stay at it anyway.

531
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,687
- Honey? About the job?
- What?

532
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:25,991
- Something's happened.
- What?

533
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,725
- The, uh...
- What?

534
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,427
The company is sending me
to, uh, a conference.

535
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:32,992
- A conference?
- [stammering] Out of town.

536
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,595
I'm gonna be gone for a few days.

537
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:38,836
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

538
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,899
[hesitating] Yes.

539
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,344
You see? They're finally
recognizing your talents.

540
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,847
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

541
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,044
- Honey! This is wonderful!
- Yes, it is.

542
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,053
[phone ringing]

543
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,383
[over phone] Hello?

544
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,424
This is Mr. Incredible.

545
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:55,420
I'm in.

546
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:05,599
The Omnidroid 9000
is a top secret prototype battle robot.

547
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,231
lts artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

548
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:12,208
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

549
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,871
Let me guess. It got smart enough
to wonder why it had to take orders.

550
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,576
We lost control. Now it's loose
in the jungle, threatening our facility.

551
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,211
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

552
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,276
How am I going in?

553
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:28,291
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5000 feet.

554
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,886
lts cloaking devices
make it difficult to track.

555
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,262
We're pretty sure it's on
the southern half of the island.

556
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,099
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

557
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,502
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

558
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,097
You are Mr. Incredible.

559
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,894
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

560
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:09,592
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

561
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,931
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

562
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,564
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

563
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,382
[grunting]

564
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,132
Showtime.

565
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,338
[bird and insect noises]

566
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:55,041
[panting heavily, sighing]

567
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,660
[fly buzzing]

568
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,616
Huh?

569
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,284
- Hmm.
- [loud crash]

570
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,953
[cries out in pain]

571
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,456
[satisfied grunt]

572
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,659
Uh-oh.

573
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,491
[screaming with effort]

574
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,561
[laughing, loud crack]

575
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,289
Oh, my back!

576
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,886
- [loud crack]
- Oh!

577
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,932
Surprising. We must bring him back.

578
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,839
Sound the all clear,
and invite him to dinner.

579
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,455
[Syndrome, barely audible] Most
important, keep things light.

580
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:37,433
Praise him. Make him feel
like we appreciate his abilities.

581
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:40,097
Am I overdressed?

582
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,765
Actually, you look rather dashing.

583
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,870
- [Bob] I take it our host is...
- [Mirage] I'm sorry.

584
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,276
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

585
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:52,941
Of course. I do usually make it a point
to know who I'm working for.

586
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,918
He prefers a certain amount
of anonymity.

587
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:58,546
Surely, you of all people
understand that.

588
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:03,321
I was just wondering, of all the places
to settle down, why live...

589
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:07,694
With a volcano? He's attracted to power.
So am I.

590
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:11,565
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

591
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,832
I prefer to think of it
as misunderstood.

592
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,497
[chuckling] Aren't we all?

593
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,304
Volcanic soil is among
the most fertile on Earth.

594
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,504
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

595
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,846
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

596
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,031
- Jeez.
- [Helen] Hurry, honey.

597
00:42:52,102 --> 00:42:54,161
Or you'll be late for work.

598
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,765
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

599
00:42:57,841 --> 00:43:00,742
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

600
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:02,369
All that jazz.

601
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:04,107
[laughing]

602
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,886
You have an appointment?

603
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,186
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

604
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,716
- All visitors are required...
- [E] Go check the electric fence.

605
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,888
What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?

606
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:25,167
My God, you've gotten fat. Come in.
Come, come.

607
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:37,109
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

608
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:41,584
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

609
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:44,450
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prayge... Prague?

610
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,614
Milan, darling. Milan.

611
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,649
[E] Supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

612
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,162
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

613
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,755
with poofy lips who think only
about themselves.

614
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:59,735
Feh! I used to design for gods.

615
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:05,673
But perhaps you come with a challenge,
eh? I was surprised to get your call.

616
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,610
E, I just need a patch job.

617
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,910
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

618
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:16,316
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

619
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:18,753
Moonlighting hero work?

620
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,847
Must have happened a long time ago.

621
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:24,052
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

622
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,858
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

623
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,957
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

624
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:34,198
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

625
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,967
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

626
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,532
A new suit? Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

627
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,078
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

628
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,341
So ask me now,
before I again become sane.

629
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,316
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

630
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,717
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

631
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,884
- [E] It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

632
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:59,224
- Heroic!
- Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

633
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:02,595
Oh! He had a great look!
Oh, the cape and the boots...

634
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:03,690
[E] No capes!

635
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:08,901
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

636
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:11,805
[E] Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.

637
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,742
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

638
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:21,548
[E] All was well, another day saved
when his cape snagged on a missile fin.

639
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:23,950
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

640
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:25,045
Stratogale!

641
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:30,424
[E] April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.

642
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,758
You can't generalize
about these things.

643
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:36,163
[E] Meta-man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.

644
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,396
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

645
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:43,566
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

646
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,665
You know I'm retired from hero work.

647
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,543
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

648
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:53,447
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

649
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:57,613
[sighs]
Fine. I will also fix the hobo suit.

650
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:02,182
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

651
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,800
[phone rings]

652
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:17,571
[Bob] Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

653
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,474
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

654
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:27,374
- [Mirage] How soon can you get here?
- [Bob] I'll leave tomorrow morning.

655
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,180
- [Mirage] See you there.
- Goodbye.

656
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:34,786
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

657
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:37,725
Another conference.
Short notice, but you know...

658
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,626
...duty calls.
[nervous laugh]

659
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:49,598
- [Helen] Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

660
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,173
- Ha... have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

661
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,678
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

662
00:46:56,747 --> 00:47:01,081
- So much.
- I love you too.

663
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,255
[ship's computer]
This is your automated Captain.

664
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:19,564
Would you care for more mimosa?

665
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,799
- [Bob] Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

666
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:28,905
Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.

667
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:38,683
Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.

668
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:06,476
[Mirage] Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

669
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,608
Thanks.

670
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:11,142
Nice to be back, Mirage.

671
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:40,210
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at two.

672
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,720
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

673
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:45,414
See you there.

674
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,555
[gasps] Edna.

675
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,387
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
- [E] This is Edna.

676
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,189
- E? This is Helen.
- Helen who?

677
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,527
Helen Parr? You know...

678
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:30,488
Elastigirl?

679
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:34,799
Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!

680
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,532
[stammering] It's been a while.

681
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:40,269
There's only one person Bob would trust
to patch his supersuit. That's you.

682
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,437
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

683
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:45,276
Much better than those horrible pajamas
he used to wear.

684
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,045
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

685
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:50,552
- [Helen] I'm calling about...
- Don't make me beg.

686
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,522
- I won't do it, you know.
- Beg, no, I'm calling about suit.

687
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:57,492
[stammering] Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

688
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:01,395
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

689
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,902
Hmm.

690
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,153
[creaking]

691
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,391
[Syndrome] It's bigger!

692
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,222
It's badder!

693
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:43,635
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

694
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,436
It's finally ready.

695
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:52,539
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

696
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,676
but man, it wasn't good enough!

697
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:59,813
After you trashed the last one,
I had to make some major modifications.

698
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,155
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

699
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:07,390
I mean, after all,
I am your biggest fan.

700
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:12,026
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

701
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,329
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

702
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:18,033
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

703
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:21,703
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

704
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,406
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

705
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:28,008
[Syndrome] It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.

706
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,349
You can't count on anyone.

707
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,354
Especially your heroes.

708
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,516
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

709
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,925
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

710
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:40,622
That's the way it works.

711
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:43,427
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

712
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,333
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

713
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:49,099
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

714
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:53,370
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

715
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,011
[laughing] You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

716
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:00,049
I can't believe it.

717
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,576
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.

718
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,748
I save the best inventions for myself.

719
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:09,587
Am I good enough now?

720
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,653
Who's super now?

721
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,664
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

722
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,294
Oh, brilliant!

723
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,667
[coughing]

724
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,853
All right, try this one on
for size, big boy.

725
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,236
[groaning, sputtering]

726
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:16,317
Gazerbeam.

727
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,602
[Bob] "Kronos?"

728
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:59,229
[scanner] Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.

729
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:07,402
[E] This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

730
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:11,743
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

731
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:15,717
Simple, elegant, yet bold.
You will die.

732
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:17,878
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

733
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:21,549
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

734
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:25,584
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

735
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,857
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

736
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,900
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

737
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,060
That is why I show you my work.

738
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,933
That is why you are here.

739
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,708
Edna Mode.

740
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,138
And guest.

741
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:04,894
Come. Sit.

742
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:12,069
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

743
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,804
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

744
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,871
[E] Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

745
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:22,042
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

746
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:26,822
[E] and can also withstand
a temperature of over 1000 degrees.

747
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,955
Completely bulletproof.

748
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,825
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

749
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,766
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

750
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:43,169
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

751
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:46,504
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

752
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,908
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

753
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,037
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

754
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:56,710
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

755
00:55:56,786 --> 00:56:01,120
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

756
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:03,751
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

757
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:09,390
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

758
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:17,097
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

759
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,108
and still retain its shape.

760
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,406
Virtually indestructible...

761
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:26,376
...yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

762
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,907
As an extra feature, each suit contains
a homing device,

763
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:34,252
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

764
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,992
Well, darling? What do you think?

765
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:42,998
What do I think?
Bob is retired! I'm retired!

766
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,761
Our family is underground.

767
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:48,235
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

768
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:50,499
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

769
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,474
Why would he keep secrets from you?

770
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:56,535
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

771
00:56:56,613 --> 00:57:00,208
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

772
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,615
Prone to weakness.

773
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:06,086
- What are you saying?
- Do you know where he is?

774
00:57:06,156 --> 00:57:09,956
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

775
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:37,014
[voices, static on radio]

[voice on radio]

779
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:44,218
- [guard] Hey, hey. We got a man down!
- [guard 2] Come on, let's go.

780
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:50,357
[guard 2] Are you okay? What happened?

781
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,760
[over radio] Break surveillance
and engage. Continuing sweep...

782
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,200
- [over phone] Insuricare.
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

783
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:43,363
Bob Parr is my husband.
I was wondering if you could give me

784
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:47,603
the number of the hotel he's staying at?
The number I have is no good.

785
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:50,544
- Mr. Parr no longer works here.
- What do you mean?

786
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:53,207
He's on a business trip.
A company retreat.

787
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:56,217
My records say he was terminated
almost two months ago.

788
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:16,768
[gasps]

789
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:30,109
So, you don't know where he is.

790
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:35,455
Would you like to find out?

791
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,192
[relieved sigh]

792
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,895
[beeping]

793
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:54,928
[sobbing] I am such an idiot.

794
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:57,336
I let this happen, you know.

795
01:02:57,406 --> 01:03:01,399
The new sports car, the getting
in shape, the blond hair, the lies.

796
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:04,742
Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

797
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:08,545
Now I'm losing him! What'll I do?
What'll I do?

798
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,382
What are you talking about?

799
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:16,989
You are Elastigirl! My God!
Pull yourself together.

800
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:19,152
What will you do?
Is this a question?

801
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,696
Show him you remember
that he is Mr. Incredible,

802
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,790
and you will remind him who you are!

803
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:29,429
Well, you know where he is.
Go! Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

804
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:33,339
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

805
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:35,900
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

806
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:40,005
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

807
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:41,947
I should be back tonight. Late.

808
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,111
You can be in charge that long,
can't you?

809
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,917
Yeah. But why am I in charge again?

810
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,457
Nothing.
Just a little trouble with Daddy.

811
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:53,928
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

812
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:57,898
I mean either he's in trouble,
or he's going to be.

813
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:06,701
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

814
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:09,006
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

815
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:11,603
We all get cool outfits?

816
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,343
- Dash! You come back here this moment!
- [phone rings]

817
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:18,218
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back.

818
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:21,848
I know this is short notice,
but I was hoping that I could...

819
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:24,893
- What are these?
- Look, I'm The Dash!

820
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:27,725
- The Dash likes.
- [Helen] Just a second.

821
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:31,631
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

822
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,693
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

823
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,931
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

824
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:40,373
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

825
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,536
What makes you think it's special?

826
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:47,549
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?

827
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:59,492
Snug, I'm calling
in a solid you owe me.

828
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:03,054
- [over phone] What do you need?
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

829
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:05,623
Let me think.

830
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:16,843
lsland approach.
India Golf niner-niner checking in.

831
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,474
- VFR on top. Over.
