Do you have a second?
l could use a little help here.

Help with what?

73
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,764

l'm a doctor, but l just can't reach it.

- Like the drapes.

- No, you can do this, l'm telling you.

You don't seem afraid at all.

94

l don't understand that.

95
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,667
Well, fear's sort of an odd thing.

96
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,574
When l was in residency,
my first solo procedure

97
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,019
was a spinal surgery
on a 1 6-year-old kid. A girl.

98
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:48,353
And at the end, after 1 3 hours,
l was closing her up and l...

99
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,959
l accidentally ripped her dural sack.

100
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,432
lt's at the base of the spine
where all the nerves come together.

101
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,766
Membrane as thin as tissue, and...

102
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,568
So it ripped open.

103
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,240
Nerves just spilled
out of her like angel hair pasta,

104
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,339
spinal fluid flowing
out of her and l...

105
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,713
The terror was just so...

106
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,423
...crazy, so real...

107
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,766
...and l knew l had to deal with it.

108
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,062
So l just made a choice.

109
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:36,164
l'd let the fear in.
Let it take over. Let it do its thing.

110
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,042
But only for five seconds,
that's all l was gonna give it.

111
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,342
So l started to count.

112
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,406
One, two,

113
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:50,353
three, four, five.

114
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,417
And it was gone.

115
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,857
l went back to work,
sewed her up and she was fine.

116
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:06,099
lf that had been me, l think
l would've run for the door.

117
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,671
No, l don't think that's true.

118
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,840
You're not running now.

119
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,064
You think they
would have come by now.

- Shannon, we may be here for a while.
- The plane had a black box, idiot.

124

they're coming.

125
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,433
l'll eat on the rescue boat.

126
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,275

- Yeah. Thanks.

you know, baby stuff?

129

No... l'm okay.

- Yeah, you too.

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,040
Do you know him?

135
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,735
He was sitting next to me.

136
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,080
We must've been at about
40,000 feet when it happened.

137
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,321
We hit an air pocket and dropped...

138
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,694
...maybe 200 feet.

139
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,991
The turbulence was...

140
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,803
l blacked out.

141
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,042
l didn't.

142
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,581

143
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,986
l knew that the tail was gone, but l...

144
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,287
...couldn't bring myself to look back.

145
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,252
And then the front end
of the plane broke off.

146
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,062
Well, it's not here on the beach.

147
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,502
Neither is the tail.

148
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,302
We need to figure out
which way we came in.

149
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,345
- Why?
- There's a chance we find the cockpit.

150
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,404
lf it's intact, we might be able
to find the transceiver.

151
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,542
We could send out a signal,
help the rescue party find us.

How do you know all that?

Wasn't for me.

00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,121
- That was weird, right?
- ls that Vincent?

165
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,247
lt's not Vincent.

166
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,421
Did anybody see that?

167
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,594
Yeah.

168
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,829

Terrific.

173
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,146
So, how's the drink?

174
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,427
- lt's good.
- That wasn't a very strong reaction.

175
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,362
Well, it's not a very strong drink.

176
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,393
Just don't tell anyone.

177
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,701
This, of course, breaks some
critical FAA regulations.

178
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,529
Excuse me.

179
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,974
- [woman] Sir, excuse me!
- Guess he really had to go.

Oh, l know. l've just
never been a very good flier.

187
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,734
My husband keeps reminding me
that planes want to be in the air.

188
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,143
Well, he sounds like a very smart man.

189
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,877
Be sure and tell him that
when he gets back from the bathroom.

Well, l'll keep you company
until he does.

Don't worry. lt's gonna be over...

[man 1] lt didn't sound like an animal,

[woman 1] l keep thinking there

- [woman 2] Where you from?
- [woman 1] Bronx.

You ready?

199
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,181
You showed me where the smoke was.
l can get there myself.

l'm coming.

Well, you're gonna need better shoes.

202
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:32,390
Whatever it was, it wasn't natural.

00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:36,560
- Does anyone have any sunblock?
- Yeah, l do.

204
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:41,038
So l was just looking
inside the fuselage.

205
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,370
lt's pretty grim in there.

206
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,002
You think we should
do something about the...

...B-O-D-Y-S?

No, they'll deal with it
when they get here.

211
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,854
l'm gonna go out
and look for the cockpit.

212
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,932
See if we can find a transceiver to send
a distress signal. Help the rescue team.

See if we can find a transceiver to send
a distress signal. Help the rescue team.

214
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,958
You need to keep an eye
on the wounded.

215
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,629
lf the guy in the suit wakes up,
keep him calm,

216
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,400
but don't let him remove
that shrapnel. Understand?

217
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,533
Got it. What about the guy
with the leg? The tourniquet...?

l took it off last night.

No, it's cool. l don't really feel
like standing still, so...

222
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,624
Excellent.

223
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,265
Can l ask you something?

224
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:49,296
Me? l'd be thrilled. l've been waiting.

225
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,036
Have we ever met anywhere?

226
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,445
No. That would be unlikely.

227
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,176
- l look familiar though, right?
- Yeah.

228
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,878

- No, l can't.

You shouldn't move.

- Where's Jack? Did you see him?
- l don't know. He pulled me up.

323
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,524
- Where is he?
- l don't know!

324
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,720
- How can you not know?
- l fell down. He came back.

325
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,956

- Did you see it?

326
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,498
No. No.

327
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:31,330
But it was right there.
We were dead... l was.

328
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:35,429
And then Jack came back and he
pulled me up. l don't know where he is.

329
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,950
- We have to go back for him.
- Go back? There?

330
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,181
There's a certain
gargantuan quality about this thing.

331
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,250
Then don't come.

332
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,417
Kate.

333
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,956
l heard you shout.

334
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,288
l heard you shout ''Jack.''

335
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,263

336
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,194
What is that?

337
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,154
- What is...?
- lt's the pilot.

338
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,798
Did you see it?

339
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:22,141
No. lt was right behind me,
but l dove into the bushes.

340
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,279
Guys...

341
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:27,476

like that happen?
