488

<i>Which means I have
to get to the crater.</i>

489
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:30,051
<i>Okay, so here's the rub.</i>

490
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:31,955
<i>I've got one working Rover</i>

be recharged at the Hab.</i>

493
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:41,196
<i>That's Problem A.</i>

494
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:44,566
<i>Problem B is this

495
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:48,002
<i>roughly 50 days to complete.</i>

496
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:50,506
<i>So I gotta live for 50 days...</i>

497
00:35:50,507 --> 00:35:52,640
<i>inside a Rover with

<i>the size of a small van.</i>

499
00:35:56,913 --> 00:35:58,546
<i>So, in the face of

500
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:01,283
<i>I'm left with only one option.</i>

501
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,521

the shit out of this.</i>

Uh...

504
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:42,726
I have doubled my battery life
by scavenging <i>Rover 1.</i>

505
00:36:43,793 --> 00:36:46,730
But if I use the heater...

506
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:52,536
I will burn through half
my battery every day.

507
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:57,807
If I do not use my heater, I will be...

508

(LAUGHS) slowly killed by
the laws of thermodynamics.

509
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:04,914
I would love to solve
this problem right now

510

Cool. Teddy, you're Earth.

starting its month-long
deceleration to intercept.

(WHOOSHING)

1202
01:24:14,275 --> 01:24:16,708
we start accelerating immediately

We don't intercept with Earth at all...

but we come close enough

1206

to get a gravity assist and adjust course.

1207
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,519

1208

at this point to fall into orbit...

1216

01:25:18,972 --> 01:25:20,640
<i>Well, if Vincent says so.</i>

1231
01:25:21,941 --> 01:25:24,077
We need to use the <i>Taiyang Shen?</i>

1232
01:25:24,078 --> 01:25:25,477
VINCENT: Uh-huh.

1233
01:25:25,478 --> 01:25:27,613
What am I missing? Why is that important?

1234
01:25:27,614 --> 01:25:29,147
Because we can only do one.

1235
01:25:29,148 --> 01:25:31,383
Send Watney enough food to
last till <i>Ares 4...</i>

1236
01:25:31,384 --> 01:25:34,052
or send <i>Hermes</i>
back to get him right now.

1237
01:25:34,053 --> 01:25:35,087
Both plans require the <i>Taiyang Shen,</i>

1238
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:37,390
so we have to choose.

1239
01:25:37,391 --> 01:25:39,025
But what about the <i>Hermes</i> crew?

1240
01:25:39,026 --> 01:25:40,892
We'd be asking them to add

1241
01:25:40,893 --> 01:25:44,396
533 extra days to their mission.

1242
01:25:44,397 --> 01:25:46,237
Yeah. They wouldn't
hesitate, not for a second.

1243
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:49,034
Can the <i>Hermes</i> function for 533 days

1244
01:25:49,035 --> 01:25:50,236
beyond the scheduled mission end?

1245
01:25:50,237 --> 01:25:51,404
It should.

1246
01:25:51,405 --> 01:25:53,573
Built to last the full
<i>Ares</i> mission...

1247
01:25:53,574 --> 01:25:56,175
so technically, it's only
halfway through its lifespan.

1248
01:25:56,176 --> 01:25:57,577
But if something goes wrong...

1249
01:25:57,578 --> 01:25:59,412
Then we lose the crew.

either have a high chance</i>

1252

We don't have to make it, Bruce.

Okay.

1276
01:27:28,067 --> 01:27:29,569
Let's take a look.

1277
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,608
Uh...

1278
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:36,977
Let's see.

1279
01:27:39,044 --> 01:27:41,547
This isn't a JPEG.

1280
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:44,118
It's a plain ASCII text file.

1281
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:48,700
I don't really know what we're looking at.

1282
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:51,458
Does that make any sense to you?

1283
01:27:53,593 --> 01:27:56,096
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."

1284
01:27:56,097 --> 01:27:58,865
It's a course maneuver
for the <i>Hermes.</i>

1285
01:28:04,338 --> 01:28:06,772
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept,

1286
01:28:06,773 --> 01:28:08,007
211 days later.

1287
01:28:09,276 --> 01:28:11,310
MARTINEZ: Would it work?

1288
01:28:11,311 --> 01:28:13,245
LEWIS: Mmm-hmm. We ran the
numbers. They check out.

1289
01:28:13,246 --> 01:28:14,881
BECK: It's a brilliant course.

1290
01:28:14,882 --> 01:28:18,017
So why all the cloak and dagger?

1291
01:28:18,018 --> 01:28:19,819
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

1292
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:21,988
Yeah. If we do the maneuver,

1293
01:28:21,989 --> 01:28:24,190
they'd have to send the
supply ship or we die.

1294
01:28:24,191 --> 01:28:27,528
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

1295
01:28:28,294 --> 01:28:30,930
So, are we gonna do it?

1296
01:28:32,264 --> 01:28:34,266
If it was up to me, we'd
already be on our way.

1297
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,903
But it is, though, isn't it? Up to you.

1298
01:28:36,904 --> 01:28:38,270
(CHUCKLES) Not this time.

1299
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:41,208
This is something NASA expressly rejected.

1300
01:28:42,008 --> 01:28:43,976
We're talking about mutiny here,

1301
01:28:43,977 --> 01:28:45,444
which is not a word that I take lightly.

1302
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:48,314
So we do this together or not at all.

1303
01:28:48,315 --> 01:28:51,449
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.

1304
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:54,553
If we mess up the supply
rendezvous, we die.

1305
01:28:54,554 --> 01:28:57,455
If we mess up the Earth
gravity assist, we die.

1306
01:28:57,456 --> 01:29:00,659
If we do everything perfectly...

1307
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:04,129
we add 533 days to our mission.

1308
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:08,101
533 more days before we
see our families again.

1309
01:29:08,102 --> 01:29:12,738
533 days of unplanned space travel...

1310
01:29:12,739 --> 01:29:14,373
where anything could go wrong.

1311
01:29:14,374 --> 01:29:17,945
If it's mission critical, we die.

1312
01:29:18,579 --> 01:29:19,912
Sign me up.

1313
01:29:19,913 --> 01:29:21,346
All right, cowboy, slow down.

1314
01:29:21,347 --> 01:29:23,483
You and I, we're military.

1315
01:29:23,484 --> 01:29:24,984
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.

1316
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:26,185
Yeah, there's that.

1317
01:29:26,186 --> 01:29:27,619
LEWIS: And for the rest of you guys...

1318
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:30,522
I guarantee they will never
send you back up here again.

1319
01:29:30,523 --> 01:29:35,093
Good. So, if we go for
it, how would it work?

1320
01:29:35,094 --> 01:29:36,729
I plot the course and execute it.

1321
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:38,230
JOHANSSEN: Remote override.

1322
01:29:38,231 --> 01:29:39,297
They could take over the <i>Hermes</i>

1323
01:29:39,298 --> 01:29:40,833
from Mission Control.

1324
01:29:41,869 --> 01:29:44,203
LEWIS: Can you disable it?

1325
01:29:44,204 --> 01:29:46,372
<i>Hermes</i> has four
redundant flight computers...

1326
01:29:46,373 --> 01:29:48,807
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.

1327
01:29:48,808 --> 01:29:50,142
We can't shut down the comms

1328
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:51,677
because we'd lose telemetry and guidance.

1329
01:29:51,678 --> 01:29:53,412
And we can't shut down the computers

1330
01:29:53,413 --> 01:29:55,347
because we need to run the ship.

1331
01:29:55,348 --> 01:29:58,818
I'd have to disable remote
override on each system.

1332
01:29:58,819 --> 01:30:00,852
It's part of the OS, I'd
have to jump over the code.

1333
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:03,623
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?

1334
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,859
I can do it.

1335
01:30:07,561 --> 01:30:08,896
Great.

1336
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:12,032
Well, it has to be unanimous.

1337
01:30:12,766 --> 01:30:17,604
If we do this, it'll be
over 900 days of space.

1338
01:30:19,739 --> 01:30:23,775
That's more than enough
space for one life...

1339
01:30:23,776 --> 01:30:25,645
so, yes.

1340
01:30:25,646 --> 01:30:27,180

01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:17,663
Will somebody find out who
the hell Rich Purnell is?

1366
01:31:17,664 --> 01:31:19,565
SANDERS: Annie will go before
the media this morning...

1367
01:31:19,566 --> 01:31:21,301
and inform them of NASA's decision

1368
01:31:21,302 --> 01:31:24,235
to reroute the <i>Hermes</i> to Mars.

1369
01:31:24,236 --> 01:31:26,072
Sounds like a smart move.

1370
01:31:26,972 --> 01:31:29,941

1371

1377
01:31:47,326 --> 01:31:49,095

It's bigger than one person.

1379
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:54,601
No.

1380
01:31:54,602 --> 01:31:55,836
It's not.

1381
01:31:57,036 --> 01:32:00,740
When this is over, I'll
expect your resignation.

1382
01:32:03,877 --> 01:32:05,378
I understand.

1383
01:32:05,379 --> 01:32:07,981
Bring our astronauts home.

1384
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:13,953
Every <i>Ares</i> mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.

1385
01:32:13,954 --> 01:32:16,622
So NASA decided a long time
ago it's a lot easier...

1386
01:32:16,623 --> 01:32:18,056
to send some of the stuff beforehand

1387
01:32:18,057 --> 01:32:19,492
rather than bring it with us.

1388
01:32:19,493 --> 01:32:23,096
So, as a result, the
MAV for <i>Ares 4...</i>

1389
01:32:23,097 --> 01:32:24,463
is already there

1390
01:32:24,464 --> 01:32:26,632
at the Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.

1391
01:32:26,633 --> 01:32:30,369
So the plan is for me to
use that to go into orbit...

1392
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:33,405
just as the <i>Hermes</i> is passing...

1393
01:32:33,406 --> 01:32:36,876
and I guess they catch me?

1394

In space.

1395
01:32:42,615 --> 01:32:45,051

What's the intercept plan?

1661
01:50:36,989 --> 01:50:39,323
We finished attaching the

1662
01:50:39,324 --> 01:50:41,426
It's 214 meters long.

1663
01:50:41,427 --> 01:50:42,694
And I'll have the MMU,

1664
01:50:42,695 --> 01:50:44,462
so moving around should be easy.

How fast a relative
velocity can you handle?

1666
01:50:47,365 --> 01:50:49,934
I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second.

Well, we may have some leeway.

And it'll be 52 minutes before intercept.

1672
01:51:03,249 --> 01:51:05,717
Once Mark's engine shuts off...

1673
01:51:05,718 --> 01:51:08,218
we'll know our intercept
point and velocity.

01:55:58,209 --> 01:55:59,944
About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.

1748
01:55:59,945 --> 01:56:01,812
I'll see you in a few, Commander.

1749
01:56:01,813 --> 01:56:03,446
JOHANSSEN: <i>four...</i>

Altitude, 1350 meters.

1756
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:49,961
That's too low.

1757
01:56:49,962 --> 01:56:51,430
It's fighting me.

1758

1762
01:57:08,981 --> 01:57:10,315
He's well below target altitude.

1763
01:57:10,316 --> 01:57:11,983
How far below?

1764
01:57:11,984 --> 01:57:13,583
JOHANSSEN: Checking.

1765
01:57:13,584 --> 01:57:15,520
Watney.

1766
01:57:15,521 --> 01:57:17,020
Do you read?

1767
01:57:17,021 --> 01:57:18,321
BECK: <i>He's probably passed out.</i>

1768
01:57:18,322 --> 01:57:19,556
<i>He pulled 12 g's on the ascent.</i>

1769
01:57:19,557 --> 01:57:20,891
<i>Give him a few minutes.</i>

1770

LEWIS: <i>Watney?</i>

1778
01:57:42,914 --> 01:57:44,515
<i>Do you read?</i>

1779
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:46,583
<i>It seems there's
some sort of problem</i>

1780
01:57:46,584 --> 01:57:48,319
<i>with the transmission.</i>

1781
01:57:55,192 --> 01:57:57,128
JOHANSSEN: <i>I have interval pings.</i>

1782
01:57:57,129 --> 01:57:58,962
Intercept velocity will
be 11 meters per second.

1783
01:57:58,963 --> 01:58:00,932
I can make that work.

1784
01:58:01,667 --> 01:58:04,168
JOHANSSEN: Distance at intercept will be...

1785
01:58:04,169 --> 01:58:06,404
We'll be 68 kilometers apart.

1786
01:58:06,405 --> 01:58:08,506
BECK: <i>68 kilometers?</i>

1787
01:58:08,507 --> 01:58:10,943
<i>Did she just say 68 kilometers?</i>

1788
01:58:11,776 --> 01:58:12,642
Come on, guys, keep it together.

1789
01:58:12,643 --> 01:58:13,845
Work the problem.

1790
01:58:14,478 --> 01:58:16,846
Johanssen, time to intercept?

1791
01:58:16,847 --> 01:58:18,817
JOHANSSEN: <i>39 minutes, 12 seconds.</i>

1792
01:58:19,450 --> 01:58:20,851
Martinez, what if we point our thrusters

1793
01:58:20,852 --> 01:58:22,653
in the same direction?

1794
01:58:22,654 --> 01:58:25,923
Well, it depends how much
fuel you wanna save...

1795
01:58:25,924 --> 01:58:27,056
for the altitude adjustments
for the trip home.

1796
01:58:27,057 --> 01:58:28,458
How much do you need?

1797
01:58:28,459 --> 01:58:32,830
I can get by with about
20% of what we have left.

1798
01:58:33,999 --> 01:58:37,267
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude-adjust fuel...

1799
01:58:37,268 --> 01:58:39,136
that will bring the
intercept range to zero.

1800
01:58:39,137 --> 01:58:40,404
Do it.

1801
01:58:41,139 --> 01:58:44,542
Hang on. It brings the range to zero...

1802
01:58:44,543 --> 01:58:47,144
but the intercept velocity
will be 42 meters per second.

1803
01:58:47,145 --> 01:58:49,413
<i>And that's way too fast.</i>

1804
01:58:49,414 --> 01:58:51,414
Then we'll have 39 minutes to figure out

1805
01:58:51,415 --> 01:58:53,018
how to slow down.

1806
01:58:55,954 --> 01:58:57,855
Martinez, burn the jets.

1807
01:58:57,856 --> 01:58:59,524

1814
01:59:33,792 --> 01:59:35,959
<i>I broke my ribs.</i>

1815

<i>How are you?</i>

1816
01:59:37,395 --> 01:59:38,495
LEWIS: <i>We're working
on getting to you.</i>

1817
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,998
<i>There was a complication
during launch.</i>

1818
01:59:39,999 --> 01:59:41,932
Copy that.

1819
01:59:41,933 --> 01:59:43,967
How bad is it?

1820
01:59:43,968 --> 01:59:45,470
LEWIS: <i>We've corrected
the intercept range,</i>

1821
01:59:45,471 --> 01:59:47,605
<i>but we've got a problem
with intercept velocity.</i>

1822
01:59:47,606 --> 01:59:48,873
WATNEY: <i>How big a problem?</i>

1823
01:59:48,874 --> 01:59:50,641
42 meters a second.

1824
01:59:50,642 --> 01:59:51,943
Well...

1825
01:59:52,878 --> 01:59:54,746
shit.

1826
01:59:59,618 --> 02:00:01,519
<i>Commander, I have an idea.</i>

1827
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,253
LEWIS: <i>Go ahead, Mark.</i>

1828
02:00:03,254 --> 02:00:06,489
Well, if I can find
something sharp in here...

1829
02:00:06,490 --> 02:00:09,494
and poke a hole in the
glove of my EVA suit...

1830
02:00:09,495 --> 02:00:11,962
I could use the escaping
air as a thruster...

1831
02:00:11,963 --> 02:00:13,696
<i>and fly towards you.</i>

1832
02:00:13,697 --> 02:00:17,167
<i>It would be easy to control
because it would be on my arm.</i>

1833
02:00:17,168 --> 02:00:19,003
LEWIS: I can't see you having
any control if you did that.

1834
02:00:19,004 --> 02:00:20,937
You'd be eyeballing the intercept

1835
02:00:20,938 --> 02:00:23,373
using a thrust vector
you can barely control.

1836
02:00:23,374 --> 02:00:27,110
Yes, those are all very good points.

1837
02:00:27,111 --> 02:00:30,081
But consider this.

1838
02:00:32,150 --> 02:00:34,784
I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.

<i>Communication lost. Stand by.</i>

1844

Maybe it's not the worst idea.

1845
02:00:49,834 --> 02:00:51,702
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.

1846
02:00:51,703 --> 02:00:53,003
Not what he said.

1847
02:00:53,004 --> 02:00:55,407
Using atmosphere as thrust.

1848
02:00:57,409 --> 02:00:59,610
What happens if we blow the VAL?

1849
02:00:59,611 --> 02:01:01,645
Wait, you want to open
the vehicular airlock?

1850
02:01:01,646 --> 02:01:02,980
It'll give us a good kick.

1851
02:01:02,981 --> 02:01:05,048
But also blow the nose off the ship.

1852
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:07,952
And all the air would leave
and we need air to not die.

1853
02:01:07,953 --> 02:01:10,187
We would seal the bridge
and the reactor room.

1854
02:01:10,188 --> 02:01:11,821
Everywhere else would go vacuo.

But I feel obliged to mention

1863

Absolutely not.
