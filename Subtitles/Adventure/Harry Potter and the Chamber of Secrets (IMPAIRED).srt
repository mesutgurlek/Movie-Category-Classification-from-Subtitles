1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,120



2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,600
Harry Potter and Chamber of secret

3
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
I can't not let you out, Hedwig

4
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,800
I am not allowed to use magic outside of school.

5
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,480
besides, if uncle Vernin.....

6
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Harry Potter!!!

7
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
now, you've done it!

8
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,880
Petunia!

9
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,680
I am warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to let it go

10
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,680
but she's bored

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,200
if can only let her out an hour or two.

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,800
ha! so, you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends ? no sir!!

13
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,960
but I haven't had any messages from any of my friends

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,680
not one! 

15
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,680
who want to be friends with you?

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I think you should be a little more grateful, we raised you since you are a baby.

17
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,800
give you the food on our table, even you had the dudley's second bed room, purity of goodness of our hearts!

18
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,280
Not now, Pumpkin, look, Mason's will arrive

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,000
Which should be any minute!

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
let's go over our schedule once again, shall we?
Petunia,when the Mason's arrive,you will be?

21
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,280
In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciouslly to our home

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,280
good,Dudley, you will be?

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
I will be waiting to open the door

24
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,600
Excellent!

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,200
and you?

26
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,880
I will be in my bedroom

27
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,800
making no noise and pretending I don't even exist

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,400
too right you will!

29
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,880
without any luck this could to do harm to the biggest deal of my career, 

30
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,000
and you will not mess it up!

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Harry Potter! Such an honor it is!

32
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,480
Who are you?

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,880
Dobby, sir! Dobby, the house elf!

34
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,000
Not to be rude or anything, but it isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,880
Oh, yes sir, Dobby understands ! 

36
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,200
it is just...Dobby have come to tell you

37
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,600
it is difficult to,sir

38
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,200
Dobby wander where it begin

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,080
Why don't you sit down?

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,400
Sit down!  Sit down?

41
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,080
Oh......

42
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,080
oh, Dobby, shushi...I am sorry, I didn't mean to offend you or anything

43
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,600
Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard your greatness, sir

44
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,880
but never has been asked to sit down by a wizard

45
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,400
like equal

46
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,680
You can't have met many decent wizards then

47
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,480
No, I haven't

48
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,680
but it is an aweful thing to say

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
Stop, Dobby, stop!

50
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Dobby, please stop!

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,280
Oh, don't mind that, it's just the cat!

52
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,280
Stop, Dobby, Stop!

53
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you all right!

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
Dobby have to punish himself, sir

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir

56
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Your Family?
The wizard family Dobby serves, sir...

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,200
Dobby is bound to serve one house and one family forever,

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,280
if he has ever knew Dobby was here, oh....

59
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,600
But Dobby has to come, Dobby has to protect Harry Potter, to warn him

60
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,480
Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts,

61
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
the school of  Witchcraft and Wizardry this year!

62
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,280
there is a plot

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,040
a plot to make most terrible things happen


64
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,200
What terrible things?

65
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,800
Who's plotting them?

66
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,000
Ah..I...Can't...Say !!!

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,200
Ok, I understand

68
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,280
you can't say!

69
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,480
Dobby, Dobby, put the lamp down !

70
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,200
so, when there arrives nine folks

71
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
can we go on?

72
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Dobby, stop

73
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
get in that and keep quiet!

74
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
what devil are you doing out there?

75
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I was just....

76
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,000
You've just ruined the
punch line of my Japanese golfer joke

77
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,880
sorry

78
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,880
One more sound and you'll
wish you'd never been born, boy!

79
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,080
fix the door!

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,800
yes, sir

81
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,480
See why I've got to go back to
Hogwarts? 

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,800
I don't belong here

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,080
I belong in your world, Hogwarts

84
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,800
it's only place I got friends

85
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,600
Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?

86
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
well, I expect they've just been...

87
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,000
Hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?

88
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby.

89
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Dobby hoped ... if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him ... 

90
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Harry Potter might not want to
go back to school, sir . .....

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,200
give me those 

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,960
now!

93
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,400
no
no
Dobby, come back here

94
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,480
Dobby, Please

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,320
No
Harry Potter must say he is not going back to school

96
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,480
I can't,Hogwarts is my home

97
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,600
then, Dobby must do it, sir

98
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,600
For Harry Potter's own good!

99
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,480
I am so sorry

100
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,600
it's my nephew, he is very disturbed!

101
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,600
we think strangers upset him, let we keep him upstairs

102
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,080
you are never going back to that school

103
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,280
you are never going to see those freaky friends of yours again

104
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
never

105
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,880
Hi, Harry!

106
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,680
Ron? Fred? George?

107
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
What are you all doing here?

108
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Rescuing you, of course!

109
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Come on, get your trunk!

110
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,760
Better stand back

111
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:12,280
drive!

112
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,440
let's go!

113
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Are you hearing anything?
what's it?

114
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Potter---------!!!

115
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Come on, Harry

116
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Petunia,he is escaping!

117
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,600
uncle, to heaven....

118
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,160
come out!

119
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,160
let go of me!

120
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,360
no, no, boy, you and that bloody pigeon, 

121
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
I am not, anywhere!

122
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
drive

123
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
not!

124
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,400
by the way, Harry, Happy birthday!

125
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,200
hi, come on

126
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Just think of if they are aware of this
they wouldn't, would they?

127
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,080
it is not much! but it's home

128
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,400
I think it is briliant!

129
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,800
where have you been?

130
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,200
Harry, how wonderful to see you, dear

131
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,000
beds are empty, no note, car gone, 

132
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,080
you could've be dying, you could've been seen

133
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,800
Of course, I don't blame you, Harry, dear

134
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,600
they were starving him, Mom

135
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,200
put bars in his window

136
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,480
you best hope I don't put bars on your window,Ron and Weasley

137
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,400
come, Harry, time to some breakfast

138
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Here we go, Harry, not talking, That's it, Here we go

139
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,600
Mom, have you seen my jumpa?

140
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
yes, it was on the cat

141
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
hello

142
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,080
what did I do?

143
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,480
Ginny,She's been talking about you all summer

144
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,200

145
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600

What a night,Nine raids. Nine!

148
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200

149
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Daddy works in ministry of magic
The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.
Dad loves muggles,he think they are facinating

150
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,400

159
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
your son flew in that enchanted car of yours 

160
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
to save him back last night

161
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800

162
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,400

183
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,880

184
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,480
and you go

185
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,280

Harry, watch out, excuse me, mam

236

Nice big smile, Harry, to get you and I together on front page

237
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Ladies and gentlemen,What an
extraordinary moment this is!

238
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,880
When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning

I bet you love that, didn't you, Potter?

249
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,680
famous Harry Potter,Can't even go into a bookshop
without making the front page.

250
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,280
leave him alone

251
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,400
Harry Potter, you've got yourself a girlfriend

252
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,080
not now,Draco, be nicely

253
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,200
it's Potter

254
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Lucius Malfoy, we meet at last

255
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,280
forgive me, your scar is legended

256
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,080
as,of course, the wizard who gave to you

257
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,280
Voldemort killed my parents

258
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,680
he is nothing more than a murderer

259
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,000
en, you must be very brave to mention his name


260
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,200
or could be foolish

261
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,880
fearful name only creats a fearful thing itsself

262
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,880
and you must be Mrs Granger

263
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,080
yes, Draco told me all about you

264
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,080
and your parents

265
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Muggles, aren't they?

266
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,680
let me see, red hair, 

267
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,680
vacant expressions,

268
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,280
secondhand book you must be with Weasley's

269
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,680
children, It's smelling in here, let's go outside.

270
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, well, well, Weasley's here now

271
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,000
Lucius

272
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,080
this is time of ministry, Arthur, with all those raids

273
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,040
I do hope they're paying you overtime?no judge like state of this,I'd say, no,

274
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,560
what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?

275
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:48,200
We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard,Malfoy
clearly,

276
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,200
associating with muggles

277
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,280
I thought your family could sink no lower

278
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,600
I'll see you at work

279
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,200
see you at school

280
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,200
10:58, come on, come on,train will be leaving any moment
train, George, Percy, you first

281
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000

282
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,200
come on, Ginny, get your seat, hurry

283
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,200
let's go

284
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
ai, what do you think you are doing?

285
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,200
sorry

286
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,880
lost control of trolley

287
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,400
why can't we get through

288
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,400
I don't know, the gateway sealed itself for some reason

289
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,000
the train leaves at exactly 11 clock, we missed it

290
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Harry, if we can't through, 

291
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,240
maybe mom and dad can't get back

292
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,080
maybe we just go to wait by the car

293
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,880
the car

294
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,200
Ron, I should tell you

295
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,080
Most muggles aren't customed to see a flying car

296
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,080
eh, right

297
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,000
oh, no,the Invisibility Booster must be faulty

298
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,880
oh, come then, let's go lower

299
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,600
we need to find the train

300
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,600
ok

301
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,800
now all we need to do is catching with the train

302
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,600
can't be far behind

303
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,080
can you hear that?

304
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,080
must be getting close
hold on

305
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Harry, hold on

306
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,080
take my hand

307
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,080
hold on

308
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,400
I am trying
your hand on sweating

309
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,680
I think we found the train

310
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,680
yeah

311
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,680
welcome home!

312
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,000
up up

313
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
it's not working

314
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:39,800
try that tree! 
stop, stop, stop!

315
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,280
my wand....

316
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,680
look at my wand
thanks this wand for your neck

317
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,680
what's happenning?
I don't know

318
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,480
come on, go, fast

319
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Scabbers, you are ok?

320
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,680
the car... 

321
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,280
dad gonna kill me

322
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,600
see you, Hedwig.

323
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,800
wait

324
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,600
so, a house elf shows up in my bedroom

325
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,080
we can't get through the barrier 
to get platform nine and three-quarters

326
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,800
we almost get killed by a tree

327
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,800
clearly someone just want me hurt this year

328
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,880
well, take a good look, lads

329
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,880
this night might well be the last you spend in this castle

330
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,400
oh, dear, we are in trouble

331
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,400
you were seen by no less than 7 muggles

332
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,680
do you have any idea how serious this is?

333
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,680
you have risked to expose our world

334
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,360
not to mention that damage and inflict on Whomping Willow which is on the ground since before you were born

335
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,200
Honestly, Professor Snape 

336
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,200
I think it did more damage to us

337
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Silence!  

338
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,080
I will assure you,

339
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,680
were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me

340
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,400
the both of you would be 

341
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,280
on the train home tonight! as it is 

342
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,000
they are not

343
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,200
Professor Dumbledore

344
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,080
Professor McGonagall

345
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,680
Headmaster

346
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,600
these boys have flouted the Decree 

347
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,600
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, as such

348
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I well aware of our rules,Severus

349
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,480
have reading quite a few of them myself

350
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,480
en, but their head are in Gryffindor House

351
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,400
it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action

352
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,680
we're going to get our stuff then

353
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,080
what are you talking about? Mr. Weasley?

354
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,600
you are going to expel us, aren't you?

355
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,200
Not today, Mr.Weasley

356
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
but I must impress on both of you

357
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
the seriousness of what you have done

358
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,280
I'll be writing to your families tonight

359
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,400
and you'll both receive detention

360
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,880
good morning every one!

361
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
good morning, Professor Sprout

362
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,200
welcome to greenhouse 

363
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,480
three second year

364
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,200
gather around, now, everyone

365
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,800
today,We are going to repot Mandrakes . 

366
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root?

367
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,200
yes, Mrs Granger?

368
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,680
Mandrake, or Mandragora

369
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,480
It is used to return those who have been petrified

370
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,800
to their original state

371
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,200
it is also quite dangerous, Mandrake cry's fatal to anyone who hears it,"

372
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,480
Excellent

373
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Ten points to Gryffindor

374
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,600
now, as our mandrakes are still only seedlings

375
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,880
their crys won't kill you yet

376
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,000
but they will knock you out several hours

377
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,480
that's why I give each of you a pair of earmuffs

378
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,680
for all of your protections, 

379
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,080
so could you please put them on right away

380
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,880
quickly

381
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
flats tight down

382
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,800
watch me closely

383
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
you grasp your mandrake firmly

384
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,280
you pull it 

385
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,280
sharply out of pot

386
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,400
go get it, and now

387
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,400
you dump it down to other pot and

388
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,000
pour it little sprinky soil

389
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
till it can't move

390
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,280
ah, Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs  

391
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,000
no, Mam, 

392
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,480
he is just fainted

393
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,400
ah, as well, let's leave him back

394
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,080
right, here we go

395
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,480
plenty pots to go around

396
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,480
grasp your mandrake and pull it up

397
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,000
hey, is that nearly headless, isn't it?

398
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
hello, Percy! Mr Clearwater
hello, Headless Nicholas

399
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,280
say it, I am doomed

400
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,880
you're doomed

401
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,080
hey, Harry

402
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,800
I'm Colin Creevey

403
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I'm in Gryffindor, too.

404
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,400
hey, Colin, nice to meet you

405
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Ron, is that your owl?

406
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,080
bloody bird, it is a mess

407
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,200
oh, no

408
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,400
look, every one, Weasley got himself 

409
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,000
a howler

410
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,760
go on, Ron, 
I ignored one from my Gran once, it was horrible

411
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
WHAT A WEASLEY!

412
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,400
HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR?

413
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,680
I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING

414
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,200
YOUR FATHER IS NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK

415
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,200
AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT!

416
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,120
IF
YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE 

417
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,360
WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME.

418
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,880
Oh, Ginny dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor

419
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,880
your father and I are so proud of it

420
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
let me introduce you 

421
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,200
to your new defense against dark art teacher

422
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,160
me

423
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,080
Gilderoy Lockhart

424
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,600
Order of Merlin, Third Class

425
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,600
Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner 

426
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,280
of Witch Weekly's Most-Charming-Smile Award

427
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,480
but I don't talk about that

428
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,080
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!

429
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,680
Now, be warned

430
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,680
It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind!

431
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,480
You may find yourselves 

432
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,800
facing your worst fears in this room.

433
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,080
Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.

434
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,080
I must ask you not to scream

435
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,480
it might provoke them

436
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,000
Cornish pixies

437
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,880
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

438
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,000
lots of you aren't fear of them,the pixies can be devilish tricky little blighters

439
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:46,800
Let's see what you make of them!
Come on now - round them up, round them up, they're only pixies

440
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,680
hey, please, get me down

441
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,680
get off me, 

442
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,200
stop, stop, hold still

443
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,200
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

444
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,680
Well, I'll ask you three 

445
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,680
to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.

446
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,400
what we do now?

447
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,400
immobilas

448
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,600
why it is always me?

449
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,280
I spent this summer devising an all new Quidditch program

450
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,000
we are going to train  

451
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,880
earlier

452
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,080
harder, and longer

453
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,680
what?

454
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,680
I don't believe it

455
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,680
what do you think you are going? Flint

456
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,400
Quidditch practice

457
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,800
I booked the patch for Gryffindor today

458
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,080
easy,Woods, I've got note

459
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,600
oh, a small trouble

460
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,800
I, Professor Severus Snape, hereby 

461
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,800
give the Slytherin team permission to practice today

462
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,680
owing to the need to train their new Seeker.

463
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,680
you got new seeker, who?

464
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,880
Malfoy?

465
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,480
that's right,that's not always you want to see it

466
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,200
those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones, how did you get those?

467
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,080
gift from Draco's father

468
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,800
you see, Weasley, unlike some

469
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
my father can afford the best

470
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,480
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in

471
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,800
They got in on pure talent.

472
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,200
No one asked your opinion

473
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,240
you fiIthy little Mudblood

474
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:22,360
you will pay for that one, Malfoy, eat slugs

475
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,200
you ok? Ron?

476
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,880
say something

477
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,400
well, can you turn around, Harry

478
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,480
no, Colin, get out the way

479
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,000
let's take him to Hagrid

480
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
how long it'll do?

481
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,400
opps, this calls the real special equipment

482
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
nothing to do but wait for it to stop,I am afraid

483
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,480
Better out than in, who's he tried to curse, anyway?

484
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,200
Malfoy

485
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,400
he called Hermione

486
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,400
A..., well,I don't know exactly what it means

487
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,200
he called me mudblood

488
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,600
he did not

489
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,880
what's mudblood?

490
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,800
it means dirty blood

491
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born
some one with no magic parents

492
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
some one like me

493
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,600
it's sort of tongue when you usually hear stuff in conversation

494
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,200
so thing is, Harry

495
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,000
there are some wizards - like Malfoy's family

496
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,680
who think they're better than everyone else because they're what people call pure-blood

497
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,680
it's horrible

498
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,680
it's disgusting

499
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,800
aren't just call what up to birth

500
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,800
dirty blood, there is no wizard alive day that is no halfblood or less 

501
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,800
more to the point, not yet a sigle spell our Hermione can' do

502
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,880
come here

503
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,200
don't you think on it, Hermione

504
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,200
don't you think on it for one minute

505
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,480
Harry, Harry, harry, can you possibly imagine?

506
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,200
a better way to serve the detention?

507
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,200
by helping me to answer my fan mail?
not really

508
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,480
Fame's a fickle friend, Harry

509
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,680
Celebrity is as celebrity does

510
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
remember that

511
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,200
[Come ... come to me.... Let me rip you.... Let me tear you .... Let me kill you . .]

512
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,200
what?

513
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,600
sorry?

514
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,000
that voice

515
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
voice?

516
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
didn't you hear it?

517
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,600
what are you talking about? Harry

518
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,000
are you getting a lit bit drowsy?

519
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,480
Great Scott -no wonder, look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours!

520
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,480
spooky, how the time flys when we're having fun

521
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
spooky

522
00:42:52,880 --> 00:43:10,880
[I smell blood, let me rip you,let me kill you,kill....]

523
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,280
Harry!
did you hear it?

524
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,880
hear what?
that voice

525
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
voice? what voice?

526
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,880
I heard it first at Lockhart office, then again, it just

527
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,880
it's moving

528
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,400
I think it's gonna kill
kill?

529
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,800
Harry, wait, don't be so fast

530
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
strange

531
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,080
I've never seen spiders act like that

532
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,080
I don't like spiders

533
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,080
what's that?

534
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,080
the chamber of secret has been opened

535
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:22,000
enemies of the heir...be ware
it's written in blood

536
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
oh, no

537
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,680
it's Filth's cat, Mrs.Norris

538
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,480
enemies of heir, be ware

539
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,480
you'll be the next, mudblood

540
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,200
what's going on there? go out of my way, my way, my way

541
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,960
Potter? what do you......

542
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,800
that's Mrs.Norris

543
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,600
you murdered my cat

544
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,680
no, no

545
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,480
I'll kill ya

546
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,600
I'll kill ya!

547
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,600
Argus! 
Argus!

548
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,800
every one will proceed to dormitory immediately, 

549
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,800
every one, except,

550
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:48,200
you three
...Gryffindors, follow me...

551
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,280
she is not dead, Argus

552
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,680
she has been petrified

553
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,800
ah, Potter,so unluck I wasn't there

554
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,800
I know the exact the countercurse that could've spare her

555
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,480
but how she's been petrified, I can not say

556
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,680
ask him

557
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,800
he must've done it, you saw what he wrote on the wall

558
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,800
it is not true, sir, I swear

559
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,080
I've never touch Mrs. Norris

560
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,080
rubbish

561
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,080
If I might, Headmaster?

562
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,480
perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time

563
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,680
however

564
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
the circumstances are suspicious
I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner

565
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,800
I am afraid that's my doing, Severus

566
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,800
you see, Harry's helping answer my fan mail

567
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,800
that's why Ron and I're looking for him,professor

568
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,720
we just found when he said

569
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,720
yes, Mrs Granger?

570
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,280
when I said I wasn't hungry

571
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,280
we were heading back to common room when we found Mrs. Norris

572
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,200
innocent until proven guilty,Severus

573
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,200
my cat has been petrified

574
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,360
I want to see some punishment

575
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,600
we will be able to cure her,Argus

576
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,160
as I understand

577
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:26,880
Madem Sprout has very healthy grown Mandrake
with which all the potion will be made,we will revive Mrs.Norris

578
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,120
at the mean time, I strongly recommend caution

579
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,080
to all

580
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,000
it's bit strange, isn't it?

581
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,480
strange?

582
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,400
you heard the voice, 

583
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,400
the voice only you can hear, and Mrs.Norris turned out petrified

584
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,200
it's just strange

585
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,200
do you think I should've told them, Dumbledore and others, I mean

586
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,080
are you mad?

587
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,600
no,Harry, even in the wizard world, hearding voices isn't a good sign

588
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,400
she is right, you know

589
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,600
could I have your attention please?

590
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,800
right, now, today we will be transforming animals 

591
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,280
into water goblets

592
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,280
like this,1, 2, 3

593
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,400
fetherfethertol

594
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,000
now, it's your turn

595
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
well, who would like to go first

596
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,080
oh, Mr.Weasley, 1, 2, 3, fetherfethertol

597
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,080
fethervertol

598
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,880
that one need replacing, 

599
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,800
Mr.Weasley

600
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,600
yes, Mrs Granger

601
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,680
professor, I was wondering	

602
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,680
If you can tell us,about,the chamber of secret

603
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,280
very well, you all knew, of course

604
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,680
Hogwart was founded over thousands years ago by the four greatest wizards and witches of age

605
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:38,800
Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin.

606
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,400
three of the founders concensused quite harmoniously

607
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,200
one did not, so we guess it is who

608
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,800
Slytherin wished to be more selective 

609
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,000
about the students admitted to Hogwarts.

610
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,000
He believed 

611
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,680
that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.

612
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,800
in another words, pure blood

613
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:09,800
unable to persuade others, he desided to leave the school

614
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,800
now, according to legend

615
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,600
Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle

616
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,160
known as the chamber of secret

617
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,520
though shockly, before departed, he sealed it

618
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,760
until that time when his own true heir returned to the school

619
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:34,080
the heir alone will be able to open the chamber

620
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:42,840
and unleash the horror within, and by so doing 

621
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,680
to purge the school of all those who in Slytherin's view  were unworthy to study magic.

622
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,080
muggleborn

623
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,880
Naturally,the school 

624
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,880
has been searched many times

625
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,800
no such chamber has been found

626
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,480
professor

627
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,480
what's exactly the legend tell us the light in the chamber?

628
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,280
the chamber is said to be home to something 

629
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,800
that only the heir of Slytherin

630
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,800
can control

631
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,880
it is said to be the home of a monster

632
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,280
so it is true, she told us there is really a chamber of secret

633
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,080
yes, could you tell?

634
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,600
McGonagall's worried and all the teachers are

635
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,880
and if there is really a chamber of secret and really hasn't been opened

636
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,880
that means,
the heir of Slytherin has returned Hogwart

637
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,000
the question is, who is it?
that's stink,who do we know 

638
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,280
who thinks all muggleborns are scums
If you're talking about Malfoy

639
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,200
of course, you heard him
You'll be next,Mudbloods! I heard him

640
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,280
but,Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

641
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,560
maybe Ron is right, Hermione

642
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,400
I mean, look at his family,The whole lot
of them have been in Slytherin for centuries

643
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,520
Crabbe and Goyle must know,maybe we can trick him to tell them

644
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,280
even they aren't that pig, but there might be another way

645
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,480
remind you, it would be difficult

646
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,800
not mention we'll break about 50 school rules

647
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,800
and it'll be dangerous

648
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,880
very dangerous

649
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,000
here it is

650
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Polyjuice Potion.

651
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:32,000
properly brewed Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporaly into phisical form of other

652
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,480
here,you know,if Harry and I drink that stuff

653
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,800
we'll turn to Crabbe and Goyle

654
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,080
yes
you kidding..

655
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,480
Malfoy'll tell us anything

656
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,400
exactly

657
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,400
but truth is I've never see a more complicated potion

658
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,200
eh, well, how long will it take to make?

659
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,000
a month

660
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,200
a month

661
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:56,200
but, Hermione, if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin, he could've attacked half muggleborns in the school by then

662
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,280
I know

663
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:01,280
but it's the only plan we got

664
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,880
another ball for Slytherin

665
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
they lead Gryffindor 90 to 30

666
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,280
All right there, 

667
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,200
Scarhead?

668
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,800


669
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,800
watch yourself, Harry

670
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,880
wood, look out

671
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,000
Hermione

672
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Harry got himself a wild Bludger

673
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,400
let's be tempered, we said, us
no, stop it

674
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,000
no,
even with proper one is too risky

675
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
even with proper one is too risky

676
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
you could hurt Harry

677
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,800
training for the ballet, Potter?

678
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,680
you gonna catch me? Potter?

679
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:38,880
let's go

680
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,600
Harry Potter caught the Snitch, Gryffindor win!

681
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,200
thank you
are you ok?

682
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,000
no, I think my arm broke

683
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,680
do not worry, Harry

684
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,400
I will fix that of your arms straight away

685
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,200
no, not you

686
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,400
you don't know what are you saying...now

687
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,400
this won't hurt a bit

688
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,480
BRAKYAMY IMENDO

689
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,680
ah,yes, well, that can sometimes happen

690
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,680
but the point is you can no longer feel any pain

691
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,280
and very clearly, the bones are not broken

692
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,480
broken? there is no bones left

693
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:51,480
much more flexible though

694
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,400
oh, Mr Malfoy I will make things as fast as you can go

695
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,080
out my way, out my way

696
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:00,080
You should have come straight to me!
I can mend bones in a hard speed  - but growing them back

697
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,600
You will be able to, won't you?

698
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,480
I'll be able to, certainly, 

699
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,200
but it will be painful

700
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:09,280
You're in for a rough night, Potter

701
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,280
regrowing bones is a nasty bussiness

702
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,600
what do you expect? Pumkin juice?

703
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:29,600
[kill...kill...]

704
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,880
hello

705
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,400
Dobby?

706
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,600
Harry Potter should've listened to Dobby

707
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,600
Harry Potter should've gone back home when he missed the train

708
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,680
it was you,You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through!

709
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,280
Indeed, yes, sir

710
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,600
you nearly got Ron and me expelled

711
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,000
at least you would be away from here

712
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Harry Potter must go home

713
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:16,600
Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see the...
your Bludger? you made that Bludger chase after me?

714
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,400
Dobby feels the most grief, sir

715
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,400
Dobby had to iron his hands

716
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:30,080
You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.

717
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,400
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

718
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,880
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.

719
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,280
I don't suppose you could tell me why you tried to kill me?

720
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,280
not kill you, sir,  never kill you

721
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,280
Dobby remmeber Harry Potter before Harry Potter trumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named

722
01:00:54,200 --> 01:01:00,200
We house-elfs were treated like vermin, sir!
Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin

723
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,480
ah..ah....

724
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,280
why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

725
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,400
This, sir? This a mark of the house-elf's enslavement

726
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:23,400
Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes

727
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,480
listen, listen, terrible thing is about to happen in Hogwart

728
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,000
Harry Potter must not stay here

729
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Now, that history is to repeat itself

730
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,880
repeat itself, you mean this' happened before?

731
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,880
eh--I shouldn't have said that

732
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,000
bad Dobby
stop

733
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:56,200
stop, stop, Dobby

734
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,000
tell me, Dobby

735
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,280
when did this happen before?

736
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:01,680
who is doing it now?

737
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,800
Dobby can not say, sir

738
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,200
Dobby only want Harry potter to be safe

739
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,200
no, Dobby, tell me, who is it?

740
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,800
put him here

741
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,600
what happened?

742
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,000
there's been another attack

743
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I think, do you know,I think 

744
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
he's been petrified,Madam Pomfrey.
you don't think

745
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:43,520
perhaps he managed to get a picture of his attacker?

746
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,800
What can this mean, Albus?

747
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,800
it means our students are in great danger

748
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,880
what you have to tell the staff?

749
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,880
the truth, tell them, the Hogwart is no longer safe

750
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,800
it is as we feared, meanever

751
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,800
that the Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.

752
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,280
again? you mean the chamber of secret had been opened before?

753
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,480
of course

754
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,000
don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must've opened the Chamber when he was at school here

755
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
now he's told Draco how to do it

756
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,680
maybe, but we have to wait Polyjuice potion to make sure

757
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,680
and why it's me,why are we brewing this potion in poor daylight in the middle of girl's never treat

758
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,080
don't you think we'll get caught?

759
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,480
no
no one ever comes in here

760
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:50,080
why? Moaning Myrtle
who?

761
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,400
Moaning Myrtle

762
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,400
who is Moaning Myrtle?

763
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,280
I am Moaning Myrtle

764
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,600
I wouldn't expect you to know me

765
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:09,600
who would ever talk about ugly,miserable,moping, Moaning Myrtle?

766
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,680
she is a little sensitive

767
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,200
gather around, 

768
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,880
gather around, can everybody see me?

769
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,880
can you all hear me? excellent

770
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,200
in lights of dark events 

771
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,600
of recent weeks Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission 

772
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,600
to start this little dueling club, to train you all up

773
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:52,600
in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself

774
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:59,080
have done on countless occasions to full details, see my published works

775
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,800
let me introduce my assistant

776
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,800
professor Snape

777
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,600
he has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration

778
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,280
Now, I don't want any of you youngsters to worry

779
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,280
you'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him, 

780
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:24,280
never fear!

781
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:41,880
1,2,3

782
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,480
Expelliarmus!

783
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:56,680
do you think he is all right?
who cares?

784
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,200
an excellent idea to show them that,Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying

785
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,480
it was pretty obvious what you were about to do.

786
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,280
If I had wanted to stop you 

787
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,600
it would have been only too easy

788
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,400
perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the student

789
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,400
to block unfriendly spell, professor

790
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,600
Excellent suggestion, professor Snape

791
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,600
let's have volunteer pair
Potter,Weasley, how about you?

792
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,480
Weasley is one causes devastation with simpliest spell

793
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,480
who sent Harry Potter to 

794
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,200
hospital wing in match box

795
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,200
may I suggest some one from my own house?

796
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,200
Malfoy? perhaps?

797
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,200
good luck, Potter
yea,sir

798
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:01,200
wands at ready

799
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:03,280
scared? Potter

800
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:07,280
you wish

801
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,400
on the count of three

802
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,680
cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm 

803
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:24,400
we don't want any accidents here

804
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,200
1,2

805
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:32,200
Ivertasvaty

806
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,280
Rictusempra!

807
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,600
I said disarm only

808
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:02,680
Serpensortia!

809
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,280
don't move, Potter

810
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,080
I get rid of it for you

811
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:13,800
allow me, professor Snape

812
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,800
WOLATIOUSENDULY

813
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,000
SAYASASI

814
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:43,000

817
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,280
what are you playing at

818
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:26,200
You're a Parselmouth. Why didn't you tell us?

819
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,680
I am a what?

820
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:32,600
you can talk to snakes? I know, I mean I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once,

821
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:36,600
once, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.

822
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:38,600
no

823
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,280
they can't,It's not a very common gift. Harry

824
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,680
this is bad

825
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,800
what's bad?

826
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,880
if I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin -

827
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,480
Oh, that's what you said to it?

828
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,200
you were there, you heard me

829
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:55,000
I heard you speaking Parseltongue, snake language

830
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,200
I spoke in different language?

831
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,480
but I didn't realize it

832
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,600
how could I speak a language 

833
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,400
without knowing I can

834
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,600
I don't how it does, but sound like you acted signal or something

835
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,080
Harry, listen to me as the

836
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,800
vision symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.

837
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,600
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth, he could talk to snakes too

838
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,080
exactly

839
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,480
And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great-great-grandson or something

840
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:27,480
but I am not

841
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:36,200
it can't be, he lived thousands years ago, for we know, you could be

842
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,480
see you back in common room
