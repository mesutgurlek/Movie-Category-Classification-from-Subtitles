1
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,160
I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,500
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,020
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,900
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...

5
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,360
...with the hottest hits
on your FM dial.

6
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,400
Come on, guys,
time to go home.

7
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,190
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,990
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,420
Okay I'll make you your favorite
dinner to compensate.

10
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,090
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,830
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,610
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,350
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,660
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,570
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,000
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,020
"Don't kill Cedric. "

18
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,640
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,000
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum"

20
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,000
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,850
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,850
She dead?

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,440
Is she dead?

24
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,510
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,270
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,530
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,090
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,090
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,280
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,640
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,470
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,540
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,980
They might come back.

34
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,570
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,420
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,030
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,840
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,590
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,380
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,190
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,270
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,100
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,180
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,180
Diddykins?

46
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,350
Is that you?

47
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,100
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,960
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,980
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,120
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,090
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,590
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

53
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,590
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

54
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,510
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

55
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,790
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

56
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,720
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

57
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,210
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

58
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,210
As a clear violation...

59
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,680
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

60
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,340
...you are hereby expelled...

61
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,880
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

62
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,020
Hoping you are well,
Mafalda Hopkirk.

63
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,190
Justice.

64
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,230
Sorry, Hedwig.

65
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,350
Very clean, these Muggles.

66
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,410
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

67
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,790
Professor Moody.

68
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,760
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

69
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,990
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled from Hogwarts.

70
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,700
No you haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

71
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,720
But the letter said...

72
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,300
Dumbledore has persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

73
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,290
...pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

74
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,760
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

75
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,760
Not here, Nymphadora.

76
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,650
Don't call me Nymphadora.

77
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,180
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

78
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,190
Come on.

79
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,500
In you go son.

80
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,390
No deaths. No proof.

81
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,100
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...

82
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,720
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

83
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,770
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

84
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,640
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.

85
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,620
Cornelius Fudge is a politician
first and a wizard second.

86
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:54,400
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

87
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,480
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

88
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,180
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

89
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,600
Heavens, you're all right.

90
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,350
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will have
to wait until after the meeting's finished.

91
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,140
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

92
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,720
Yeah.

93
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,260
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

94
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,730
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

95
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,560
...what would she
say to old Kreacher?

96
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
Oh, the shame.

97
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,270
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

98
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,600
Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.

99
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
Kreacher is here.

100
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,990
Oh, Harry.

101
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,460
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

102
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,430
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

103
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,560
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

104
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,070
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

105
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,390
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

106
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,870
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

107
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,810
So, what is this place?

108
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,090
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

109
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,090
It's a secret society.

110
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,730
Dumbledore formed it back when
they first fought You-Know-Who.

111
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,730
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?

112
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,020
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

113
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,110
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

114
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,880
- Only...
- Only what?

115
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,600
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

116
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,690
Dumbledore said that?

117
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,130
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

118
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,690
After all I'm I'm the one who
saw Voldemort return...

119
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,220
I'm the one who fought him,
I'm the one who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

120
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,900
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

121
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,090
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- Anyway if you're all done shouting...

122
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,730
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

123
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,210
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry...

124
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,340
...we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.

125
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,340
He's not a child, Molly.

126
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,340
But he's not an adult either.

127
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,950
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

128
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,950
He's as good as.

129
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,590
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

130
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,200
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

131
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,980
Perhaps Potter will grow up to
be a felon, just like his godfather.

132
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,330
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

133
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,750
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

134
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,650
About your supposed reformation.

135
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,290
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

136
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,110
- Get off it.
- Quick.

137
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,380
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

138
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,850
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

139
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,360
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

140
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,250
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

141
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,440
Well, we'll be eating
down in the kitchen.

142
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,060
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

143
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,190
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

144
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,500
Hi, Mum.

145
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,440
You hungry, Harry?

146
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,200
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

147
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,200
Harry Potter.

148
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,920
Sirius.

149
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,710
This is very, very peculiar.

150
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,520
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

151
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,350
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

152
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,010
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

153
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,140
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

154
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,630
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

155
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,120
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

156
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,160
Why?

157
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,610
The Minister thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

158
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,800
But that's insane no one in their right mind
could believe it...

159
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,110
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

160
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,940
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

161
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,910
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

162
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,430
The last time
Voldemort gained power...

163
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,800
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

164
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,760
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

165
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,690
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

166
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,770
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

167
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,630
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

168
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:00,550
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

169
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,520
He's been recruiting heavily, and
we've been attempting to do the same.

170
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,780
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

171
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,820
We believe...

172
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,750
...Voldemort may be after something.

173
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,750
Sirius.

174
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,410
Something he didn't have last time.

175
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,980
You mean like a weapon?

176
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,890
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

177
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,060
You say much more and you might as well
induct him into the Order straight away.

178
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,180
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

179
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,090
Harry.

180
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,800
You are hereby expelled.

181
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,350
Before the entire Wizengamot.

182
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,030
Trains. Underground.

183
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,190
Ingenious, these Muggles.

184
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,030
Here we are.

185
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,720
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.

186
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,640
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

187
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,330
Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

188
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,230
Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for Daily Prophet?

189
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,700
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?

190
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,320
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

191
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,510
Interdepartmental memos.

192
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,830
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

193
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,440
Merlin's beard.
Thank you, Kingsley.

194
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,550
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

195
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,010
In five minutes.

196
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,880
Department of Mysteries.

197
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,410
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

198
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,970
Yes, but we must be...

199
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,940
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

200
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,560
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

201
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,240
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

202
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,050
Yes?

203
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,100
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

204
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,690
Good luck, Harry.

205
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,720
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

206
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,950
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

207
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,830
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

208
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,930
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag...

209
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,930
Witness for the defense.

210
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,690
Albus Percival Wulfric...

211
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,520
...Brian Dumbledore.

212
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,770
You .. you got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

213
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,290
...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

214
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:43,890
But by a happy mistake,
I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.

215
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,500
The charges?

216
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,420
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

217
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,090
"That he did knowingly...

218
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,840
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

219
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,090
...produce a Patronus Charm...

220
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,540
...in the presence of a Muggle. "

221
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,890
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

222
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,390
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

223
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,820
...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

224
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,880
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot...

225
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,870
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

226
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,670
Dementors?

227
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,120
In Little Whinging?

228
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,120
That's quite clever.

229
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,850
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

230
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,410
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

231
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,730
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't...
- Enough.

232
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:40,390
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

233
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,920
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

234
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,440
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

235
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,370
Please describe the attack.

236
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,680
What did they look like?

237
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,970
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

238
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,980
Not the boys. The Dementors.

239
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,440
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

240
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,520
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

241
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,660
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

242
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:29,790
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

243
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:33,780
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

244
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,410
I don't think anyone would believe that ...

245
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,760
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

246
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,930
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

247
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,540
Dementors are, after all,
under the control of the Ministry of Magic.

248
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,200
So silly of me,
but it sounded for a moment as though...

249
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:58,320
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

250
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,370
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

251
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,690
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

252
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,210
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

253
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,200
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

254
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,380
Of course, there is someone...

255
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,220
...who might be behind the attack.

256
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,020
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

257
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,880
The evidence the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

258
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,980
He is not back.

259
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:42,010
In the matter of Harry Potter...

260
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,920
...the law clearly states...

261
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,860
...that magic may be used before Muggles
in life-threatening situations.

262
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,980
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

263
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,290
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

264
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:00,200
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

265
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,140
Those in favor of conviction?

266
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:25,260
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

267
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,830
Cleared of all charges.

268
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Professor.

269
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,070
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

270
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,580
You'll blow the entire operation.

271
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,800
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...

272
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,430
I had to see you off, didn't I?

273
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,730
What's life without a little risk?

274
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

275
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
No don't worry about me.

276
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,110
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

277
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,500
Original Order of the Phoenix.

278
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,000
Marlene McKinnon.

279
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,630
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

280
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,530
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

281
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,570
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

282
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,160
Neville's parents.

283
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,100
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.

284
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,320
It's been 14 years.

285
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,490
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

286
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,140
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

287
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,690
It feels like it did before.

288
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,010
You keep it.

289
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,950
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

290
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,990
I'll see you at the train.

291
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,100
Bye-bye, darling.

292
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,380
I love you.

293
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,730
Hold my hand, lovey.

294
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,260
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

295
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Bye.

296
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,860
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free Potter.

297
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,760
You better enjoy it while you can.

298
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,390
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

299
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,560
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

300
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,100
It's only Malfoy.

301
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,730
What'd you expect?

302
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,630
Hi, guys.

303
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,850
- Hey, Neville.

304
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,350
What is it?

305
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,940
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

306
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,870
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

307
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,740
It's pulling itself, like always.

308
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,680
You're not going mad.

309
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,720
I can see them too.

310
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,410
You're just as sane as I am.

311
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

312
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,780
Luna Lovegood.

313
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,500
What an interesting necklace.

314
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,830
It's a charm, actually.

315
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,610
Keeps away the Nargles.

316
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,650
Hungry.

317
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,140
I hope there's pudding.

318
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,320
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

319
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,610
Good evening, children.

320
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,590
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

321
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:24,690
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

322
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,370
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

323
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,860
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

324
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:35,920
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

325
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,870
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

326
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,380
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

327
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,890
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

328
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,850
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

329
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:11,200
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

330
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,960
And how lovely to see all your bright...

331
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,920
...happy faces smiling up at me.

332
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,610
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

333
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,610
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

334
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:33,600
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

335
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,260
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

336
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,870
Although each headmaster...

337
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,290
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

338
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:54,990
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

339
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,000
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

340
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,760
...perfect what can be perfected...

341
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:09,070
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

342
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:21,570
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

343
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,750
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

344
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,440
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

345
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,480
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

346
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,510
Dean, Seamus.

347
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,690
- Good holiday?
- All right.

348
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,010
Better than Seamus', anyway.

349
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,000
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

350
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,950
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

351
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:15,710
The Daily Prophet's been saying
a lot of things about you Harry and about Dumbledore as well.

352
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,070
What, your mum believes them?

353
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,170
Well nobody was there the night Cedric died.

354
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,580
Well I guess you should read the Prophet, then,
like your stupid mother, it will tell you everything you need to know.

355
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,900
- Don't you dare talk about my mother like that.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

356
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,650
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

357
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,440
Do you believe the rubbish he's come out
with about You-Know-Who?

358
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
Yeah. I do.

359
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,260
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

360
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,820
My grandmother says the daily prohet is rubbish.

361
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,820
She's cancelled her subscription.

362
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:57,450
- You all right?
- Fine.

363
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,620
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

364
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,240
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

365
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,550
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

366
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,790
Harry.

367
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:05,620
Go on Seamus. Go on go on. Go on, get it.

368
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,400
Good morning, children.

369
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,420
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

370
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,340
O- W-Ls.

371
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,720
More commonly known as OWLs.

372
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,060
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

373
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:44,860
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

374
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:55,210
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

375
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,500
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

376
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,490
...you will be following
a carefully structured, Ministry-approved...

377
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,980
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

378
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,690
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

379
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,110
Using spells?

380
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:14,180
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

381
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,130
We're not gonna use magic?

382
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:21,990
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

383
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,980
What use is that?
If we're gonna be attacked, it won't be risk-free.

384
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,370
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

385
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,980
It is the view of the Ministry...

386
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,030
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

387
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,030
...to get you through your examinations...

388
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,850
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.

389
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:44,730
And how's theory supposed to prepare us
for what's out there?

390
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,010
There is nothing out there, dear.

391
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,280
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

392
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:54,240
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe Lord Voldemort.

393
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,100
Now, let me make this quite plain.

394
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,900
You have been told...

395
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,240
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

396
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:21,830
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

397
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,250
Detention, Mr. Potter.

398
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,790
So according to you Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

399
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,610
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

400
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,750
It was murder. Voldemort killed him. You must know that!

401
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,750
Enough!

402
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,490
Enough.

403
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,680
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

404
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,890
Come in.

405
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

406
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,400
Sit.

407
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,510
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

408
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,090
No, not with your quill.

409
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,700
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

410
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,910
Now...

411
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,330
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies. "

412
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,900
How many times?

413
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,500
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

414
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:57,610
You haven't given me any ink.

415
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:00,160
Oh, you won't need any ink.

416
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:52,840
Yes?

417
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,120
- Nothing.
- That's right.

418
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,230
Because you know, deep down...

419
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,910
...you deserve to be punished.

420
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,270
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

421
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,050
Go on.

422
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,410
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

423
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,150
Get you out of class whenever you like.

424
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,200
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

425
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,960
Care for another?

426
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,890
- I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
- Oh please.

427
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:10,270
It's just ..  I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

428
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,490
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

429
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:16,400
Hermione, you're honestly
the most wonderful person I've ever met.

430
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,690
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

431
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:28,010
What's wrong with your hand?

432
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,010
Nothing.

433
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,910
The other hand.

434
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,400
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

435
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,640
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

436
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,790
Anyway I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

437
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,530
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

438
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:48,590
- If the parents knew about this...
- Yea well I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

439
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,540
Harry, you've got to report this.

440
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,270
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

441
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,680
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

442
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,820
You don't understand.

443
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,210
Then help us to.

444
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,200
Dear Padfoot...

445
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,200
...I hope you're all right.

446
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,930
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

447
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,800
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

448
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,120
I know you, of all people,
will understand.

449
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,480
Hello, Harry Potter.

450
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,630
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.

451
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,970
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

452
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,680
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

453
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,690
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

454
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,660
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

455
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:55,970
Different.

456
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,270
But why can't the others see them?

457
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,590
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

458
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:10,100
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

459
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,100
My mum.

460
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,560
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

461
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,260
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

462
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,750
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

463
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,750
Yes, it was rather horrible.

464
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:31,350
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

465
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:37,060
We both believe you, by the way.

466
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,500
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back,
and you fought him...

467
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,920
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you and Dumbledore.

468
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,780
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

469
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,320
I don't think that's true.

470
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,880
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

471
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,460
What do you mean?

472
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,920
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

473
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,280
...I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

474
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,850
...because if it's just you alone...

475
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:12,020
...you're not as much of a threat.

476
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:34,120
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

477
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,070
Harry.

478
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,630
Can I join you?

479
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,780
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

480
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,780
I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

481
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:54,160
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

482
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,100
So silly of me, but it sounds...

483
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,910
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

484
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,480
...Minerva.

485
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,390
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

486
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,060
I am sorry, dear.

487
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:12,440
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

488
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,670
...and by extension,
the minister himself.

489
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,670
I am a tolerant woman...

490
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:22,470
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

491
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,820
Disloyalty.

492
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,690
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

493
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,500
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

494
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,170
What's happened to Dumbledore?

495
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:52,040
Having already revolutionized...

496
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,250
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

497
00:47:55,250 --> 00:48:01,210
...Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...

498
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:07,330
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

499
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:25,620
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

500
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,620
Yes.

501
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:31,250
But you were unsuccessful?

502
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,430
Obviously.

503
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,930
Dream interpretation ..

504
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:28,440
.. is the most important mean of divination ..

505
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:30,130
.. for the inner eye.

506
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:34,170
See sights to which the outer world is blind.

507
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,170
What are you .. doing .. here?

508
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,020
Don't mind me dear.
You see ..

509
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,240
Professor Trelawney .. isn't it?
Hmmm.

510
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,210
In addition to my teaching duties, the Ministry has asked me to act ..

511
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:05,210
.. as an informal observer here at Hogwarts.

512
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,220
Cornelius's eyes and ears .. as it were.

513
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:14,140
Nothing whatsoever to worry about. Please do go on. I'm just a fly on the wall.

514
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,000
Dream ..
Just one question dear.

515
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,220
You've been in the post ... how long exactly?

516
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,860
nearly ... 16 years.

517
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,860
Quite a period.

518
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,310
And it was Dumbledore who appointed you?

519
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,310
He did...

520
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,890
The interpretation ..
Just one more thing if it isn't too much bother.

521
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:58,540
Could you please predict something
for me?

522
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,940
I'm sorry?
Predict something .

523
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,510
Surely you're not surprised I asked.
You would've .. foreseen it.

524
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:24,230
The inner eye does not see upon command.
Come now.

525
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:27,890
One teensy little prophecy ?

526
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:46,010
Pity.
No, wait. Wait. I .. I think I do see something.

527
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:48,920
Yes, I do. Something dark.

528
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,760
You are in grave danger.

529
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,210
Lovely.

530
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,850
Cho. What's going on?

531
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,850
It's Professor Trelawney.

532
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:49,910
Sixteen years I've lived
and taught here.

533
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,910
Hogwarts is my home.

534
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:56,840
You can't do this.

535
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,520
Actually, I can.

536
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:10,540
Something you'd like to say?

537
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,700
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

538
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,700
There...

539
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:34,810
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

540
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:37,980
Sybil, dear. This way.

541
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,980
Thank you.

542
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,010
Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...

543
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:48,500
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister...

544
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,450
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

545
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,130
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

546
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,970
That power remains
with the headmaster.

547
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,160
For now.

548
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,620
Don't you all have studying to do?

549
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,620
Professor.

550
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,880
Professor?

551
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,820
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

552
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,820
Professor Dumbledore.

553
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,220
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

554
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:38,400
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

555
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,790
She's taking over the entire school.

556
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:45,880
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

557
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,580
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...

558
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:51,030
...that these disappearances
are the work...

559
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:55,810
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.

560
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,810
Harry.

561
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:59,810
Sirius.

562
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,810
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

563
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:06,180
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

564
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,070
Training you to kill half-breeds?

565
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,090
- Sirius She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

566
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:15,860
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

567
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,430
Combat?

568
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,830
What does he think, we're forming
some sort of wizard army?

569
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:21,830
That's exactly what he thinks.

570
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:26,230
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

571
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,150
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

572
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:34,070
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

573
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:37,080
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

574
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,080
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

575
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:44,080
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

576
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:47,830
Voldemort is on the move.

577
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,180
Well, what can we do?

578
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:52,000
Someone's coming.

579
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,290
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

580
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:59,170
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

581
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:13,710
He really is out there, isn't he?

582
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,030
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

583
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:21,930
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
we need someone who will.

584
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,430
This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me?

585
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:54,900
I'm a nutter, remember?

586
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:58,820
Look on the bright side:
You can't be any worse than old toad face.

587
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,230
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

588
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,200
Who's supposed to be
meeting us, then?

589
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,200
Just a couple of people.

590
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,660
Lovely spot.

591
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:20,660
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

592
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,660
Matey, come back here.

593
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,700
Hi.

594
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:35,870
So you all know why we're here.

595
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,200
We need a teacher.

596
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,080
A proper teacher.

597
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:44,600
One who's had experience
defending themselves against the Dark Arts.

598
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,600
- Why?
- Why?

599
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,600
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

600
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,550
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

601
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,550
So Dumbledore says because he says.

602
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,070
The point is, where's the proof?

603
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,260
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

604
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:06,690
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

605
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,310
Come on, Hermione let's go. They're just here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

606
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:13,190
Harry wait.
Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm?

607
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:18,740
Yes.

608
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,890
I've seen it.

609
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,320
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

610
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:28,010
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

611
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:28,790
It's true.

612
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:31,860
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

613
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,160
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

614
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,680
Wait.

615
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:42,940
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

616
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,170
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

617
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,130
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

618
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,030
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

619
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:01,410
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

620
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:05,450
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

621
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:08,190
But out there...

622
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:11,810
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

623
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:15,660
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

624
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,380
You don't know what that's like.

625
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:31,680
You're right, Harry, we don't.

626
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:34,490
That's why we need your help.

627
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:37,260
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

628
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,510
...Voldemort...

629
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,450
He's really back.

630
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:10,300
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

631
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,670
...where Umbridge won't find out.

632
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,670
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

633
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,710
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

634
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:19,390
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

635
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:21,390
Who cares?

636
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:26,320
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?

637
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,950
Who are you and what have
you done with mankind?

638
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:33,120
Anyway, at least we know one
positive thing that came from today.

639
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,120
What's that?

640
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,910
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

641
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:44,640
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

642
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,690
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

643
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:51,830
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.

644
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:53,830
Will do, Harry.

645
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:06,750
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

646
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,030
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

647
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:14,700
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

648
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,240
You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.

649
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,580
The what?

650
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:57,070
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

651
01:01:57,070 --> 01:02:00,680
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

652
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,420
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

653
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,570
So say you really needed the toilet...

654
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:13,400
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

655
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:18,140
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

656
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:33,440
Expelliarmus.

657
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,060
I'm hopeless.

658
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:43,940
You're just flourishing your wand too much.
Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

659
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:48,990
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

660
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:52,210
...to ensure maximum retention.

661
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:56,120
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

662
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,620
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

663
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:14,180
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

664
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,880
It's sort of a wizard's bread and butter, really.

665
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:21,400
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

666
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:28,790
Stupefy!

667
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:37,910
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

668
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:45,440
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

669
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,440
Thanks, Ronald.

670
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:52,320
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

671
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,210
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

672
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:58,000
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

673
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,390
Stupefy.

674
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,340
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

675
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:18,980
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?

676
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:24,110
It was completely intentional.

677
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:53,440
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

678
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:58,740
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

679
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:01,680
Expelliarmus.

680
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,240
Very good. Keep your concentration.

681
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:09,810
Great.

682
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,810
A little higher.

683
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,620
I'm okay. I'm okay.

684
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,230
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

685
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,610
Those wishing to join the
Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

686
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:09,310
...may sign up in the
high inquisitor's office.

687
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:12,180
Diminuendo.

688
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:21,690
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

689
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,930
Believing in yourself.

690
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:26,270
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

691
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,970
Think of it this way.

692
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:31,900
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

693
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:35,970
...as nothing more
than what we are now: Students.

694
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:40,190
If they can do it, why not us?

695
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,930
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

696
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:55,800
Expelliarmus.

697
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,380
Expelliarmus.

698
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,380
Reducto.

699
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:22,490
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

700
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,090
Expelliarmus.

701
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,380
Expelliarmus.

702
01:07:34,770 --> 01:07:37,170
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

703
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,880
So that's it for this lesson.

704
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,400
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

705
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:48,130
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

706
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:51,500
And .. and well done, everyone.
Great, great work.

707
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,730
Well done, mate.

708
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:00,730
Thanks.

709
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:08,150
See you after Christmas.

710
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:20,420
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

711
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,750
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

712
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,150
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

713
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,150
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

714
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,160
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas Harry.

715
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,450
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking Harry.

716
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:38,370
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles into her tea.

717
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:40,890
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

718
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:43,650
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

719
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:59,470
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

720
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:01,940
Yeah. I'm okay.

721
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:05,050
Anyway, it's .. it's worth it.

722
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:14,080
It's just .. just learning all this...

723
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:18,090
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...

724
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,880
Cedric? Cedric did know this stuff.

725
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,980
He was really good.

726
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:27,520
It's just, Voldemort was better.

727
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,410
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

728
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:38,240
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

729
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,780
Mistletoe.

730
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,240
Probably full of Nargles, though.

731
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:57,430
What are Nargles?

732
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,310
No idea.

733
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,850
Well, how was it?

734
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,300
Wet.

735
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,670
I .. I mean, she was sort of crying.

736
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:30,670
That bad at it, are you?

737
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:33,520
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

738
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:38,890
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

739
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:41,880
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

740
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:44,770
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

741
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:53,340
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

742
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,470
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

743
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,730
...conflicted because Umbridge is threatening to
sack her mum from her job at the Ministry...

744
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:03,230
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's so busy worrying about everything else.

745
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,300
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

746
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,470
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...

747
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,440
Voldemort may be after something.

748
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:45,850
Something he didn't have last time.

749
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:49,130
Harry.

750
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:53,320
Harry.

751
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:01,840
Harry.

752
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:25,450
In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...

753
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:27,330
...or looking down at the scene?

754
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:30,010
Neither. It was like I...

755
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,750
Professor will you please just tell me
what's happening?

756
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:35,760
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

757
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,760
Make sure he's found
by the right people.

758
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,760
- Sir.
- Phineas.

759
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:42,400
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

760
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,980
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

761
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:49,150
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

762
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:53,060
They've got him, Albus.
It was close, but they think he'll make it.

763
01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:55,460
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

764
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:57,470
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

765
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:59,470
Look at me!

766
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:08,020
What's happening to me?

767
01:13:15,410 --> 01:13:17,550
You wished to see me, headmaster?

768
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:22,290
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.

769
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:25,840
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

770
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:32,270
It appears there's a connection...

771
01:13:32,270 --> 01:13:34,770
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

772
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:39,230
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

773
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:42,220
Pray he remains ignorant.

774
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,770
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

775
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:50,010
...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

776
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,960
...unhinge it.

777
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,320
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

778
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,750
...to invade the minds of his victims...

779
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:03,120
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

780
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:08,520
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

781
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,990
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

782
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,990
...kill them.

783
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:17,730
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...

784
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:20,990
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

785
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:26,760
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

786
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,620
You will attempt to resist.

787
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,620
Prepare yourself.

788
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:36,750
Legilimens.

789
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:48,300
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

790
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:15,970
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

791
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:17,970
Here we go.

792
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:20,870
Daddy's back.

793
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:28,210
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.

794
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:32,910
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

795
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,440
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

796
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,390
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

797
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:42,100
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

798
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:46,040
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

799
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,650
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

800
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:52,360
Oh, Harry, Harry.

801
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,810
There you are.

802
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:57,570
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

803
01:15:57,570 --> 01:15:59,570
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

804
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:01,570
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

805
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:03,470
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

806
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:04,970
Fred? George?

807
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:07,430
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

808
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:09,430
To Mr. Harry Potter...

809
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:13,830
...without whom I would not be here.

810
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,490
- Harry.
- Harry.

811
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:21,490
Harry.

812
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:25,140
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

813
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:27,140
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

814
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,450
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

815
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,050
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

816
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:36,050
No more than usual, Ron.

817
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,050
I don't know why...

818
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,330
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.

819
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:53,780
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

820
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:57,290
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

821
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:59,890
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

822
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:03,230
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

823
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:04,970
Of course, master.

824
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:09,670
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

825
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,890
Sorry about that.

826
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:18,320
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

827
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,000
Not to me, anyway.

828
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,500
What, you grew up here?

829
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,020
This is my parents' house.

830
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:29,780
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

831
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:34,280
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

832
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:38,670
This is the Black family tree.

833
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:41,420
My deranged cousin.

834
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,420
I hated the lot of them.

835
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:49,160
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

836
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:55,960
My mother did that after I ran away.

837
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:00,130
Charming woman.

838
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,310
I was 16.

839
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:06,300
Where did you go?

840
01:18:07,630 --> 01:18:09,900
Round your dad's.

841
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:12,770
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

842
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,990
I see him so much in you, Harry.

843
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,560
You are so very much alike.

844
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,090
I'm not so sure.

845
01:18:23,260 --> 01:18:25,510
Sirius, when I was...

846
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:31,780
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

847
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:35,220
I was the snake.

848
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:38,690
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...

849
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:42,360
...there was a moment
when I .. I wanted to...

850
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:51,670
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

851
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:55,750
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?

852
01:18:55,750 --> 01:19:01,610
I .. I just feel so angry all the time.

853
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:05,730
And .. what if, after everything
that I've been through...

854
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:11,260
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

855
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,630
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

856
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:20,070
You're not a bad person.

857
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:24,930
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

858
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,700
You understand?

859
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:34,000
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

860
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,350
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

861
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:42,810
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

862
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:47,370
That's who we really are.

863
01:19:50,670 --> 01:19:52,610
Harry, time to go.

864
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,640
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

865
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,640
You'll see.

866
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:44,260
Harry. Harry.

867
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:46,260
Hagrid's back.

868
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,150
I'm sorry.

869
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:08,030
I will say this one last time.

870
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:11,150
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

871
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:14,510
I told you. I've been away for me health.

872
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:18,870
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

873
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:24,070
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

874
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:28,370
If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

875
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:32,030
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.

876
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:53,360
This is top-secret, right?

877
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,980
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

878
01:21:56,980 --> 01:21:58,980
Giants?

879
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:01,020
You found them?

880
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:05,290
Well, they're not that hard to find, to
be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

881
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:09,380
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

882
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:11,970
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

883
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,770
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

884
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:18,220
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

885
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:21,110
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

886
01:22:21,110 --> 01:22:24,830
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.

887
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:30,910
And they did this to you?

888
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,910
Not exactly, no.

889
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:36,920
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

890
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,590
It's changing out there.

891
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:56,390
Just like last time.

892
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:59,140
There's a storm coming, Harry.

893
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:02,980
We'd all best be ready when she does.

894
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:42,420
We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...

895
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:45,320
in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.

896
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:49,110
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.

897
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,990
We strongly suspect...

898
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,220
...that the breakout was engineered...

899
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:58,700
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

900
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:03,550
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

901
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,350
..a cousin of escapee
Bellatrix Lestrange.

902
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,560
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

903
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:24,580
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

904
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:26,660
Harry.

905
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:31,270
I er .. I wanted to apologize.

906
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:35,620
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

907
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:43,150
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.

908
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,800
Neville?

909
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:05,890
Fourteen years ago...

910
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:10,380
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

911
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:13,870
...used a
Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

912
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:18,220
She tortured them for information...

913
01:25:18,370 --> 01:25:21,040
...but they never gave in.

914
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,940
I'm quite proud to be their son.

915
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:29,550
But I'm not sure
I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.

916
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,610
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.

917
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:47,630
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

918
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:51,390
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

919
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:53,390
George, your turn now.

920
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:56,960
Expecto Patronum.

921
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,810
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

922
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:04,590
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

923
01:26:04,590 --> 01:26:06,590
Wow, that was really good.

924
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:08,590
Fantastic, Ginny.

925
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:12,780
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

926
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:14,780
So focus, Luna.

927
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:20,280
Think of the happiest thing you can.

928
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,280
Expecto Patronum.

929
01:26:22,830 --> 01:26:24,600
- I'm trying ...

930
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,220
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

931
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:32,780
Expecto Patronum.

932
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:18,100
I'll make short work of this.

933
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:23,350
Bombarda Maxima.

934
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:40,890
Get them.

935
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,560
Been watching them for weeks.

936
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,950
And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...

937
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:49,250
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

938
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,350
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

939
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:54,040
...never fooled us for a minute.

940
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,160
We saw your lies for what they were:

941
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:59,810
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

942
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:00,980
Naturally.

943
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:04,050
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

944
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:08,090
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...

945
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:12,590
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's. "

946
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:15,510
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

947
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:19,480
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.

948
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:21,110
Dispatch an owl to
the Daily Prophet.

949
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:23,850
If we hurry, we should still
make the morning edition.

950
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:28,960
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...

951
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:30,960
...to Azkaban...

952
01:28:31,850 --> 01:28:36,860
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

953
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:40,080
I thought we might hit this little snag.

954
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,650
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to...

955
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:46,930
What was the phrase?

956
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:48,470
Come quietly.

957
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:50,470
Well, I can tell you this:

958
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:53,210
I have no intention of
going to Azkaban.

959
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,980
Enough of this.

960
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:56,700
Take him.

961
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:13,480
Well, you may not like him, minister...

962
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,480
...but you can't deny...

963
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:18,360
...Dumbledore has got style.

964
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:47,640
Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.

965
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:51,190
Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

966
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:56,060
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

967
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:59,960
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

968
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:14,190
Harry.

969
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:24,170
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

970
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:26,960
Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.

971
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,670
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

972
01:31:29,820 --> 01:31:31,930
Yeah, we talked you into it.

973
01:31:31,930 --> 01:31:33,930
Yeah, but I agreed.

974
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:38,870
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.

975
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:43,210
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

976
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:48,480
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

977
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,180
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

978
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:54,490
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

979
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:58,850
To go it alone.

980
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:06,770
Hagrid.

981
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:12,860
Any idea where he's taking us?

982
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:16,960
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

983
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:27,240
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

984
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:30,210
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

985
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:33,310
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

986
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:35,690
...they are gonna have a full uprising
on their hands.

987
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:37,480
Hagrid, what's going on?

988
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:39,990
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

989
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:44,520
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...

990
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,810
...I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.

991
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:51,840
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

992
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:58,560
Grawpy.

993
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:03,090
Down here, you great buffoon.

994
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:10,750
Grawpy.

995
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:14,060
Brought you some company.

996
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,100
I couldn't just leave him, because...

997
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:29,900
Because he's my brother.

998
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:31,070
Blimey.

999
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:33,570
Well, half brother, really.

1000
01:33:33,570 --> 01:33:38,580
He's completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.

1001
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:43,030
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

1002
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:45,920
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?

1003
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,240
That's your new friend, Hermione.

1004
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:50,240
Grawpy.

1005
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,050
Grawp.

1006
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,870
Put me down.

1007
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:05,980
Now.

1008
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:19,710
You all right?

1009
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:21,710
Fine.

1010
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:24,300
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1011
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:26,900
I think you've got an admirer.

1012
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:33,030
You just stay away from her, all right?

1013
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:04,350
He gets his own food and all.

1014
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:08,860
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.

1015
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,600
You will look after him, won't you?

1016
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:15,210
I'm the only family he's got.

1017
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:31,600
Feeling sentimental?

1018
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:37,910
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1019
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:42,300
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1020
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:47,720
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

1021
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:51,730
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1022
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:55,260
You're just like your father.

1023
01:35:55,590 --> 01:35:57,420
Lazy, arrogant.

1024
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:59,840
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1025
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:02,310
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1026
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:04,630
Control your emotions.

1027
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,650
Discipline your mind.

1028
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:13,330
Legilimens.

1029
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:20,030
Harry.

1030
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:21,460
Sirius.

1031
01:36:22,660 --> 01:36:24,560
I may vomit.

1032
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,460
Stop it.

1033
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,860
Is this what you call control?

1034
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:31,550
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.

1035
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:35,660
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1036
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:39,490
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1037
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:43,290
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.

1038
01:36:43,290 --> 01:36:47,150
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.

1039
01:36:47,150 --> 01:36:51,090
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1040
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:54,580
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1041
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:58,740
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

1042
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,140
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1043
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:06,510
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1044
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:08,780
Nice one, James.

1045
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,320
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.

1046
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,050
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1047
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:16,040
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1048
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:18,710
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1049
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:20,190
Enough.

1050
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,420
Enough.

1051
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:34,470
Your lessons are at an end.

1052
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:35,900
I...

1053
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:38,760
Get out.

1054
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,110
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1055
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:00,700
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1056
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:03,930
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1057
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:05,930
It's fading already.

1058
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:10,580
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1059
01:38:18,390 --> 01:38:21,110
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1060
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:24,640
...naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1061
01:38:28,110 --> 01:38:29,460
You know, George...

1062
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,950
...I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1063
01:38:33,470 --> 01:38:36,910
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1064
01:40:00,230 --> 01:40:02,250
Here you go !

1065
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:29,070
Ready when you are.

1066
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:19,460
I need that prophecy.

1067
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:21,460
You'll have to kill me.

1068
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:26,270
Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.

1069
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:28,590
Crucio.

1070
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:32,940
Crucio.

1071
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:45,650
Sirius.

1072
01:42:45,650 --> 01:42:47,000
Harry, are you sure?

1073
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,660
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.

1074
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:51,440
It's the same door I've been dreaming about for months.

1075
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:53,440
And I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.

1076
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,970
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.

1077
01:42:55,970 --> 01:42:59,150
Something he didn't have the last time,
and it's in the Department of Mysteries.

1078
01:42:59,150 --> 01:43:01,150
Harry, please, just listen.

1079
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:05,740
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1080
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,830
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1081
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:13,060
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1082
01:43:13,190 --> 01:43:16,530
Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.

1083
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:21,700
What do we do?

1084
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:23,430
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1085
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:25,510
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1086
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:28,220
Not all of them.

1087
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,490
Alohomora.

1088
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:44,380
Alert the Order if you can.

1089
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:47,420
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1090
01:43:48,330 --> 01:43:52,110
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.

1091
01:43:52,110 --> 01:43:54,670
That you are.

1092
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:59,150
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1093
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:05,600
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?

1094
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,600
- No.
- Liar.

1095
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:10,850
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1096
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:14,650
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1097
01:44:14,850 --> 01:44:16,160
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1098
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:19,580
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1099
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:22,680
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1100
01:44:26,740 --> 01:44:28,170
Unless you wish to poison him...

1101
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:32,080
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1102
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,670
I cannot help you.

1103
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:39,740
He's got Padfoot.

1104
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:43,700
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.

1105
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:46,300
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1106
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:48,300
What is he talking about, Snape?

1107
01:44:55,010 --> 01:44:57,030
No idea.

1108
01:45:01,570 --> 01:45:03,190
Very well.

1109
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:06,620
You give me no choice, Potter.

1110
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:09,880
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

1111
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:11,880
...you leave me with...

1112
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:14,340
...no alternative.

1113
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,470
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.

1114
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:18,580
That's illegal.

1115
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:22,460
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1116
01:45:29,730 --> 01:45:32,400
Tell her, Harry!

1117
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:35,000
Tell me what?

1118
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:38,180
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1119
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:40,180
...I will.

1120
01:45:41,700 --> 01:45:43,940
Where what is?

1121
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:47,450
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1122
01:45:52,030 --> 01:45:53,650
How much further?

1123
01:45:53,650 --> 01:45:55,650
Not far.

1124
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:00,710
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.

1125
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,040
What are you doing?

1126
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,040
Improvising.

1127
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:19,060
Well?

1128
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,540
Where is this weapon?

1129
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:29,950
There isn't one, is there?

1130
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:35,080
You were trying to trick me.

1131
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:43,180
You know I really hate children.

1132
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:47,420
You really are the most ...

1133
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:50,090
... untidy creatures.

1134
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:53,370
Lord knows I tried to help you.

1135
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:56,800
To instill discipline and respect ...

1136
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,980
.. for decorum.
I've tried my very best ...

1137
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:02,400
... to bring order.

1138
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:04,400
Yet at every turn ...

1139
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:11,570
I mean look .. what you've done to me.

1140
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:14,760
... I cannot take it any more.

1141
01:47:15,380 --> 01:47:18,920
I .. I put on mask .. authority.

1142
01:47:22,340 --> 01:47:28,380
... sometimes the end do justify the means.

1143
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:32,580
.. No one could blame me.

1144
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:37,660
and it would force me to sort out .. the best.

1145
01:47:37,660 --> 01:47:40,650
.. to tie up the loose end.

1146
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:43,520
.. for the greater good.

1147
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:51,030
I've got to ...  what must be done.

1148
01:48:01,970 --> 01:48:06,030
You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1149
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,080
Lower your weapons.

1150
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:16,470
I warn you, under the law,
as creatures of near-human intelligence...

1151
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:18,470
Protego.

1152
01:48:18,470 --> 01:48:20,040
How dare you?

1153
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,040
Filthy half-breed.

1154
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,410
Incarcerous.

1155
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:39,270
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1156
01:48:39,270 --> 01:48:44,090
Now, enough. I will have order.

1157
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,450
You filthy animal.

1158
01:48:55,450 --> 01:48:58,300
Do you know who I am?

1159
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:01,270
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1160
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:04,780
No, he doesn't understand.

1161
01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:14,730
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1162
01:49:14,730 --> 01:49:16,730
I'm sorry, professor.

1163
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:18,510
But I must not tell lies.

1164
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:19,910
What are you doing?

1165
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:24,340
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1166
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:27,320
Let me go!

1167
01:49:29,350 --> 01:49:31,330
Thank you, Grawp.

1168
01:49:31,330 --> 01:49:34,380
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1169
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:46,760
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1170
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:49,230
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1171
01:49:49,230 --> 01:49:52,010
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1172
01:49:52,430 --> 01:49:54,680
That was clever, Ron.

1173
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:57,140
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1174
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,630
So how are we getting to London?

1175
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:03,690
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1176
01:50:03,690 --> 01:50:07,650
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1177
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:11,090
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1178
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:14,010
Or was that all just words to you?

1179
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:18,070
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1180
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:26,610
So how are we going to get to London?

1181
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:29,710
We fly, of course.

1182
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:22,660
Department of Mysteries.

1183
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:33,100
This is it.

1184
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:29,820
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1185
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:31,820
Ninety-four.

1186
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:35,560
Ninety-five.

1187
01:52:46,150 --> 01:52:50,090
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1188
01:52:51,570 --> 01:52:53,740
It's got your name on it.

1189
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:23,250
The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1190
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:25,760
And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...

1191
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:29,960
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1192
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:38,970
For neither can live
while the other survives.

1193
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:44,250
Harry.

1194
01:53:53,850 --> 01:53:55,380
Where's Sirius?

1195
01:53:55,380 --> 01:54:00,280
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1196
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:06,010
...and reality.

1197
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:11,800
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1198
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:14,240
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1199
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,380
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1200
01:54:19,110 --> 01:54:21,510
He knows how to play.

1201
01:54:21,510 --> 01:54:25,650
Itty, bitty baby.

1202
01:54:25,890 --> 01:54:27,400
Potter.

1203
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:29,560
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1204
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:32,850
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1205
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:36,670
Better, now they're
about to be avenged.

1206
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:42,700
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

1207
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:46,960
All we want is that prophecy?

1208
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:49,210
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1209
01:54:49,210 --> 01:54:52,180
You dare speak his name?

1210
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:54,130
You filthy half-blood!

1211
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:57,540
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1212
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:04,220
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1213
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:07,260
Which is lucky for you, really.

1214
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:13,170
Haven't you always wondered...

1215
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:18,700
...what was the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1216
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:21,990
Why he was unable to kill you...

1217
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:24,770
...when you were just an infant?

1218
01:55:25,950 --> 01:55:31,050
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1219
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:37,380
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.

1220
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:39,380
All you have to do...

1221
01:55:39,570 --> 01:55:41,960
...is give it to me.

1222
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:44,730
Then I can show you everything.

1223
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,340
I've waited 14 years.

1224
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:58,340
I know.

1225
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:02,150
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.

1226
01:56:02,150 --> 01:56:04,150
Stupefy.

1227
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:22,060
Levicorpus.

1228
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:29,200
Petrificus Totalus.

1229
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,200
Well done, Neville.

1230
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:42,100
Stupefy.

1231
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:44,520
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

1232
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,670
Stupefy.

1233
01:57:05,030 --> 01:57:07,990
Reducto.

1234
01:57:23,030 --> 01:57:26,110
Get back to the door.

1235
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:05,210
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1236
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,190
The voices.

1237
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:15,220
Can you tell what they're saying?

1238
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:18,620
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1239
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:21,390
Let's get out of here.

1240
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:23,320
I hear them too.

1241
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:29,080
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1242
01:58:31,490 --> 01:58:33,500
Please, Harry.

1243
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:36,400
Get behind me.

1244
01:59:22,020 --> 01:59:24,880
Did you actually believe...

1245
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:28,610
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1246
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:34,960
...that children stood a chance
against us?

1247
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:43,220
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1248
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:49,520
Give me the prophecy now...

1249
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:54,760
...or watch your friends die.

1250
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:09,800
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1251
02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:36,810
Get away from my godson.

1252
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:10,040
Now, listen to me.
I want you to take the others and get out of here.

1253
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:12,060
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1254
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:14,250
You've done beautifully.

1255
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:19,200
Now, let me take it from here.

1256
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:46,850
Expelliarmus!

1257
02:01:46,850 --> 02:01:50,020
Nice one, James.

1258
02:01:55,210 --> 02:01:58,570
Avada Kedavra.

1259
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:47,210
I killed Sirius Black..

1260
02:02:47,210 --> 02:02:51,070
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1261
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:04,830
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1262
02:03:04,830 --> 02:03:08,620
She killed him. She deserves it.

1263
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:15,670
You know the spell, Harry.

1264
02:03:27,210 --> 02:03:29,390
Do it.

1265
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:39,370
So weak.

1266
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:49,720
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.

1267
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:51,480
The Aurors are on their way.

1268
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:55,570
By which time I shall be gone, and you...

1269
02:03:57,320 --> 02:03:59,700
...shall be dead.

1270
02:06:13,510 --> 02:06:16,370
You've lost, old man.

1271
02:06:35,890 --> 02:06:38,360
Harry.

1272
02:06:40,730 --> 02:06:42,920
So weak.

1273
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:46,260
So vulnerable.

1274
02:06:49,530 --> 02:06:52,870
Look at me.

1275
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,570
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1276
02:06:57,450 --> 02:07:00,250
It's how you are not.

1277
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:06,360
Harry?

1278
02:07:38,700 --> 02:07:40,600
You're the weak one...

1279
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:45,240
...and you'll never know
love or friendship.

1280
02:07:48,410 --> 02:07:50,950
And I feel sorry for you.

1281
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:17,500
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1282
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:23,870
And you will lose everything.

1283
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:41,050
He's back.

1284
02:09:34,740 --> 02:09:40,100
The feast about to start.
Thanks Ron I'm not really in the mood.

1285
02:09:41,590 --> 02:09:45,340
- You know I'm not hungry either.
You go on.

1286
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:49,380
Really .. I'll be okay.

1287
02:10:49,570 --> 02:10:51,830
Harry.

1288
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:56,580
Come here.

1289
02:10:56,580 --> 02:10:58,370
Come on.

1290
02:10:58,370 --> 02:11:00,020
I know how you feel, Harry.

1291
02:11:00,020 --> 02:11:02,020
No, you don't.

1292
02:11:07,310 --> 02:11:08,770
It's my fault.

1293
02:11:08,770 --> 02:11:12,000
No, the fault is mine.

1294
02:11:13,150 --> 02:11:14,940
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1295
02:11:14,940 --> 02:11:17,920
...before Voldemort made
the connection between you.

1296
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:23,350
I thought by distancing myself
from you, as I have done all year...

1297
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:28,440
...he'd be less tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.

1298
02:11:31,410 --> 02:11:33,990
The prophecy said:

1299
02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:39,430
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives. "

1300
02:11:40,660 --> 02:11:46,540
It means one of us is gonna have
to kill the other, in the end.

1301
02:11:48,710 --> 02:11:50,640
Yes.

1302
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:52,640
Why didn't you tell me?

1303
02:11:52,640 --> 02:11:55,480
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1304
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:58,840
The same reason your
friends saved you.

1305
02:11:59,570 --> 02:12:03,030
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1306
02:12:03,250 --> 02:12:06,300
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1307
02:12:07,650 --> 02:12:09,830
I cared too much about you.

1308
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:36,930
How come you're not at the feast?

1309
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:41,700
Lost all my possessions.
Apparently people have been hiding them.

1310
02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:43,050
That's awful.

1311
02:12:43,050 --> 02:12:45,050
Oh, it's all good fun.

1312
02:12:45,050 --> 02:12:48,130
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1313
02:12:48,730 --> 02:12:51,970
Do you want any help finding them?

1314
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:57,080
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1315
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:06,430
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1316
02:13:06,430 --> 02:13:08,250
That's all right.

1317
02:13:08,250 --> 02:13:10,680
Anyway, my mum always said...

1318
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:13,850
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1319
02:13:17,650 --> 02:13:21,300
If not always in the way we expect.

1320
02:13:22,530 --> 02:13:25,790
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1321
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:03,850
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1322
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,850
What's that?

1323
02:14:06,220 --> 02:14:08,850
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...

1324
02:14:09,220 --> 02:14:11,930
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1325
02:14:12,470 --> 02:14:14,380
Yeah?

1326
02:14:15,830 --> 02:14:18,650
Something worth fighting for.

1327
02:24:26,490 --> 02:24:35,740
