1
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,575
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,701
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:06,888
[ Droid Beeping ]

4
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:16,270
[ Grunts ]
We made it.

5
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:21,445
[ Man ]
I guess I was wrong.

6
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:23,777
There was no danger at all.

7
00:03:42,968 --> 00:03:45,528
Cordé.

8
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:48,573
Milady, I'm so sorry.

9
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:50,801
I've failed you, Senator.

10
00:03:51,844 --> 00:03:53,869
No.

11
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:58,173
Milady, you're still
in danger here.

12
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,482
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

13
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:12,155
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

14
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,226
Senator Amidala,
please.

15
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:31,540
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

16
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,710
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

17
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,221
- If they do break away--
- I will not let this Republic...

18
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:41,919
that has stood for a thousand years
be split in two.

19
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:45,224
My negotiations
will not fail.

20
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:49,859
If they do,you must realize
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

21
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:53,495
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

22
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,508
Master Yoda.

23
00:04:57,609 --> 00:05:00,305
Do you think it will
really come to war?

24
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,110
Hmm, the dark side
clouds everything.

25
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:11,178
Impossible to see
the future is.

26
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:16,188
[ Speaking Huttese ]
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

27
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:19,025
- Good.
- [ Huttese ]

28
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:22,032
Send them in.

29
00:05:22,134 --> 00:05:24,602
We will discuss
this matter later.

30
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:33,076
Senator Amidala,
your tragedy on the landing platform--

31
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:35,203
terrible.

32
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:38,977
Seeing you alive
brings warm feelings to my heart.

33
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,814
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

34
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,516
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

35
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,492
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

36
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:53,497
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

37
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,693
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

38
00:05:56,802 --> 00:06:00,169
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

39
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,832
But for certain,
Senator...

40
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:06,775
in grave danger you are.

41
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:10,847
Master Jedi,
may I suggest...

42
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,849
the senator
be placed...

43
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,044
under the protection
of your graces.

44
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:18,419
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

45
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,424
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe--

46
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:23,359
The situation
is that serious?

47
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:25,430
No, but I do, Senator.

48
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:28,898
I realize all too well
that additional security...

49
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,231
might be
disruptive for you...

50
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:35,466
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

51
00:06:35,574 --> 00:06:39,408
An old friend,
like Master Kenobi.

52
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:41,775
That's possible.

53
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,644
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

54
00:06:45,851 --> 00:06:47,944
Do it for me, milady.
Please?

55
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:50,453
The thought
of losing you...

56
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,258
is unbearable.

57
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:57,157
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

58
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,598
[ Senator Amidala ]
Thank you, Master Windu.

59
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:12,502
You seem
a little on edge.

60
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:14,602
- Not at all.
- I haven't felt you this tense...

61
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:16,943
since we fell into
that nest of gundarks.

62
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:20,075
[ Scoffs ] You fell into
that nightmare, Master...

63
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:22,983
and I rescued you,
remember?

64
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:26,114
Oh...yes.

65
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:28,284
[ Laughing ]

66
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:30,452
[ Chuckles ]

67
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:34,589
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

68
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:37,793
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

69
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,215
Obi? Obi!

70
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,652
Mesa so smilen
to seein yousa!

71
00:07:57,756 --> 00:08:01,055
- Good to see you again,Jar Jar.
- Senator Padmé.

72
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:04,788
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

73
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:06,865
Desa Jedi arriven.

74
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:14,199
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

75
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:16,797
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

76
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:21,276
Ani? My goodness,
you've grown.

77
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,510
So have you.
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

78
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:28,313
Well, f-for a senator,
I mean.

79
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:33,819
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

80
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:38,852
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

81
00:08:38,964 --> 00:08:41,398
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

82
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,593
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

83
00:08:43,702 --> 00:08:45,829
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

84
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:48,702
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

85
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:51,503
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

86
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,840
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

87
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:57,746
We are here to protect you, Senator,
not to start an investigation.

88
00:08:57,849 --> 00:09:00,249
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

89
00:09:00,352 --> 00:09:03,446
- I promise you.
- We will not exceed our mandate...

90
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,455
my young Padawan learner.

91
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:08,082
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master.

92
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:10,718
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

93
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:13,627
- and you will pay attention to my lead.
- Why?

94
00:09:13,732 --> 00:09:16,724
What?

95
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:20,566
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

96
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:23,937
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

97
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:26,909
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

98
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:30,277
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

99
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:35,777
And you will learn
your place, young one.

100
00:09:39,257 --> 00:09:41,282
Perhaps with
merely your presence...

101
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:44,328
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

102
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:47,193
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

103
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:49,267
I will retire.

104
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:52,604
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

105
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:56,663
I'll have an officer stationed
on every foor, and I'll be in
the control center downstairs.

106
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,602
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

107
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:04,841
She hardly even
recognized me,Jar Jar.

108
00:10:06,485 --> 00:10:09,386
I've thought about her
every day since we parted, and...

109
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,747
she's forgotten me completely.

110
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:16,988
Shesa happy. Happier den
mesa seein her in a longo time.

111
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:21,122
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

112
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:23,667
She was pleased to see us.

113
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,760
Now, let's check the security.

114
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:36,840
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

115
00:10:36,948 --> 00:10:39,508
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

116
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:42,348
My client is getting impatient.
Take these.

117
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:44,319
Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

118
00:10:44,423 --> 00:10:47,517
Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

119
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:55,129
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.
No assassin would try that way.

120
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:58,759
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

121
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:02,806
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

122
00:11:02,908 --> 00:11:04,876
- [ Beeping ]
- What's going on?

123
00:11:04,976 --> 00:11:07,376
Ah, she covered
the cameras.

124
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,538
I don't think
she liked me watching her.

125
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:11,548
What is she thinking?

126
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,676
She programmed R2
to warn us if there is an intruder.

127
00:11:14,786 --> 00:11:17,380
[ Obi-Wan ] There are many
other ways to kill a senator.

128
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:21,858
[ Anakin ] I know, but we also want to
catch this assassin, don't we, Master?

129
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:26,054
You're using her as bait.

130
00:11:26,164 --> 00:11:28,257
It was her idea.

131
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,891
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

132
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:33,994
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

133
00:11:34,106 --> 00:11:36,370
Trust me.

134
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:38,739
It's too risky.

135
00:11:38,844 --> 00:11:42,371
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

136
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,506
And yours are?

137
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,585
Possibly.

138
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:05,526
You look tired.

139
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:07,605
I don't sleep well anymore.

140
00:12:07,706 --> 00:12:10,231
Because of your mother?

141
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,213
I don't know why
I keep dreaming about her.

142
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:22,886
Dreams pass in time.

143
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:26,982
I'd much rather dream
about Padmé.

144
00:12:27,092 --> 00:12:31,290
Just being around her again
is... intoxicating.

145
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:34,092
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

146
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:38,499
You've made
a commitment to the Jedi order,
a commitment not easily broken.

147
00:12:38,603 --> 00:12:41,401
And don't forget, she's a politician,
and they're not to be trusted.

148
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:44,066
[ Anakin ] She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

149
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:46,110
[ Obi-Wan ] It is my experience
that senators...

150
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:49,942
focus only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

151
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:53,609
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

152
00:12:53,718 --> 00:12:55,913
-in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

153
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:58,819
At least not on
the economics of politics.

154
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:31,622
[ R2-D2 Beeps ]

155
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,995
[ Beeping ]

156
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:57,472

Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

291
00:28:30,888 --> 00:28:33,448
As wise as Master Yoda and...

00:29:37,655 --> 00:29:41,113
- Why not?
- It makes me feel uncomfortable.

312
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:45,095
Sorry, milady.

313
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:03,346
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

314
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:06,314
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

315
00:30:06,417 --> 00:30:08,385
He'll be safe with me.

316
00:30:13,257 --> 00:30:16,351
- You'll be fine.
- It's not me, milady.

317
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,191
I worry about you. What if they
realize you've left the capital?

318
00:30:20,297 --> 00:30:24,666
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

319
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,668
Anakin.

320
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,864
Don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

321
00:30:29,974 --> 00:30:32,966
Yes, Master.

322
00:30:33,077 --> 00:30:35,602
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

323
00:30:35,713 --> 00:30:37,647
You'll be back here
in no time.

324
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:40,979
I'll be most grateful for
your speed, Master Jedi.

325
00:30:41,085 --> 00:30:42,985
- It's time to go.
- I know.

326
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:45,612
Anakin, may the Force
be with you.

327
00:30:45,723 --> 00:30:47,748
May the Force
be with you, Master.

328
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:01,136
Suddenly I'm afraid.

329
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:04,833
This is my first assignment
on my own. I am too.

330
00:31:06,944 --> 00:31:08,844
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

331
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:10,914
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Beeping ]

332
00:31:14,752 --> 00:31:17,915
I do hope he doesn't
try anything foolish.

333
00:31:18,022 --> 00:31:21,480
I'd be more concerned
about her doing something than him.

334
00:31:42,012 --> 00:31:44,378
Someone to see ya, honey!

335
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,382
Jedi, by the looks of him.

336
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:52,421
- Obi-Wan!
- Hello, Dex.

337
00:31:52,523 --> 00:31:55,117
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

338
00:31:57,528 --> 00:32:00,497
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

339
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:07,562
Hey, old buddy!

340
00:32:07,671 --> 00:32:10,799
[ Both Laughing ]

341
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:16,604
Ohhh.
[ Coughs ]

342
00:32:16,714 --> 00:32:20,047
So, my friend,
what can I do for ya?

343
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,983
You can tell me
what this is.

344
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:26,352
Well, whattaya know!

345
00:32:26,457 --> 00:32:28,823
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

346
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:32,157
on Subterrel,
beyond the outer rim.

347
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:34,730
[ Obi-Wan ] Can you tell me
where it came from? Thank you.

348
00:32:34,832 --> 00:32:37,801
[ Dex ] This baby
belongs to them cloners.

349
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:42,201
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.

350
00:32:42,306 --> 00:32:45,298
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

351
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:48,708
It's these funny little cuts
on the side that give it away.

352
00:32:48,812 --> 00:32:52,748
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols. Huh!

353
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,114
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

354
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:57,414
for the difference
between knowledge and...

355
00:32:57,521 --> 00:33:00,354
[ Laughing ]
wisdom.

356
00:33:00,457 --> 00:33:03,824
Well, if droids could think,
there'd be none of us here, would there?

357
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:07,591
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

358
00:33:07,698 --> 00:33:09,666
No, no. It's beyond
the outer rim.

359
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:13,362
I'd say about,
uh, 12 parsecs...

360
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,370
outside the Rishi Maze.

361
00:33:15,472 --> 00:33:18,407
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

362
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:20,875
[ Chuckles ]

363
00:33:20,978 --> 00:33:25,745
These, uh, Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

364
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:28,716
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

365
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:33,288
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Oh, depends.

366
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,324
Depends on what, Dex?

367
00:33:35,426 --> 00:33:38,293
On how good
your manners are...

368
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:40,659
and how big your, uh...

369
00:33:40,764 --> 00:33:43,733
pocketbook is.

370
00:33:43,834 --> 00:33:46,166
[ Chuckling ]

371
00:33:47,204 --> 00:33:49,104
Hmm.

372
00:33:52,476 --> 00:33:54,603
Did you call
for assistance?

373
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:58,374
- Yes, yes, I did.
- Are you having
a problem, Master Kenobi?

374
00:33:58,482 --> 00:34:01,781
Yes, um, I'm looking for
a planetary system called Kamino.

375
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:04,149
- Kamino.
- It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

376
00:34:04,254 --> 00:34:08,554
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

377
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,025
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

378
00:34:11,128 --> 00:34:14,120
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

379
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:16,290
just south
of the Rishi Maze.

380
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:20,867
[ Beeping ]

381
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,573
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

382
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:28,577
doesn't exist.

383
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,944
Impossible. Perhaps the archives
are incomplete.

384
00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:35,109
If an item does not appear
in our records...

385
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:37,312
it does not exist.

386
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:01,601
- Hey, you! No droids!
- [ Beeping ]

387
00:35:01,712 --> 00:35:04,909
- Get outta here!
- [ Raspberries ]

388
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:11,414
- [ Beeping ]
- Thank you, R2.

389
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:16,016
- [ Chirping ]
- Must be difficult, having
sworn your life to the Jedi...

390
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:20,028
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

391
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,257
Or be with the people
that I love.

392
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:24,994
Are you allowed to love?

393
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:27,161
I thought that was
forbidden for a Jedi.

394
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:33,005
Attachment is forbidden.

395
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:36,711
Possession is forbidden.

396
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:40,374
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

397
00:35:40,484 --> 00:35:42,952
is central
to a Jedi's life.

398
00:35:45,422 --> 00:35:49,791
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

399
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:54,489
- You've changed so much.
- Ah, you haven't changed a bit.

400
00:35:54,598 --> 00:35:57,431
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

401
00:36:10,113 --> 00:36:13,844
[ Yoda ] Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

402
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:16,647
Use your feelings
you must.

403
00:36:21,058 --> 00:36:24,050
Younglings.
Younglings!

404
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:26,595
A visitor
we have.

405
00:36:26,697 --> 00:36:29,598
[Together ]
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

406
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,760
Hello. I'm sorry
to disturb you, Master.

407
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:36,566
What help can I be,
Obi-Wan? Hmm?

408
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:39,574
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

409
00:36:39,676 --> 00:36:42,839
I trust him, but the systems
don't show on the archive maps.

410
00:36:42,946 --> 00:36:47,246
Mmm. Lost a planet
Master Obi-Wan has.

411
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:49,251
- How embarrassing.
-[ Children Giggling ]

412
00:36:49,353 --> 00:36:51,981
How embarrassing.

413
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:54,785
Hmm?
Liam, the shades.

414
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,627
Gather round
the map reader.

415
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:00,890
Clear your minds...

416
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:04,456
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

417
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:08,832
It ought to be... here...

418
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:10,839
but it isn't.

419
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:14,377
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

420
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:18,073
Hmm. Gravity's
silhouette remains...

421
00:37:18,181 --> 00:37:21,150
but the star
and all the planets...

422
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:23,242
disappeared they have.

423
00:37:23,353 --> 00:37:25,378
How can this be?

424
00:37:25,489 --> 00:37:27,650
Hmm? A thought?

425
00:37:29,226 --> 00:37:32,992
-[ Yoda ] Anyone.
-[ Boy ] Master?

426
00:37:33,096 --> 00:37:35,997
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

427
00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:39,234
[ Yoda Chuckles ]

428
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:43,466
Truly wonderful
the mind of a child is.

429
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:46,041
[ Chuckling ]

430
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:48,338
The Padawan is right.

431
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:51,505
Go to the center
of gravity's pull...

432
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:55,107
and find your planet
you will.

433
00:37:59,389 --> 00:38:03,826
Hmm. The data
must have been erased.

434
00:38:03,927 --> 00:38:06,691
But, Master Yoda, who could
empty information from the archives?

435
00:38:06,797 --> 00:38:08,697
That's impossible, isn't it?

436
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:12,200
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

437
00:38:12,302 --> 00:38:16,671
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

438
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:20,209
But who and why,
harder to answer.

439
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:24,838
Meditate on this I will. Hmm.

440
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:51,304
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

441
00:38:51,408 --> 00:38:55,003
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

442
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:57,080
I'm not sure
I was ready.

443
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,377
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

444
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:04,147
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution
so you could stay in office.

445
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:06,916
I was relieved when
my two terms were up.

446
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:10,720
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

447
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:13,022
I couldn't refuse her.

448
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,463
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

449
00:39:18,602 --> 00:39:20,729
I'm glad that you
chose to serve.

450
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,678
[ Padmé ] If the senate
votes to create an army...

451
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:33,238
- I'm sure it's going
to push us into a civil war.
- [ Man ] It's unthinkable.

452
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:36,751
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

453
00:39:36,853 --> 00:39:39,344
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

454
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:41,549
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

455
00:39:41,658 --> 00:39:43,853
Not if they feel threatened.

456
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,327
My guess is they'll turn
to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

457
00:39:47,431 --> 00:39:51,800
It's outrageous, but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

458
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:55,702
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

459
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:59,799
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

460
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:04,106
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

461
00:40:10,153 --> 00:40:15,056
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

462
00:40:15,158 --> 00:40:17,854
Let's pray that day
never comes.

463
00:40:17,961 --> 00:40:20,623
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

464
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,722
What is your suggestion,
Master Jedi?

465
00:40:23,834 --> 00:40:25,734
Oh, Anakin's
not a Jedi yet.

466
00:40:25,836 --> 00:40:27,861
He's still a Padawan learner.
But I was thinking--

467
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:30,531
- Hold on a minute.
- Excuse me.

468
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,074
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

469
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:35,406
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

470
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:38,572
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

471
00:40:38,682 --> 00:40:42,311
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

472
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:46,913
I think it would be wise
if you took advantage of
my knowledge in this instance.

473
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:50,192
Sorry, milady.

474
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:55,523
[ Queen Jamillia ]
Perfect. It's settled, then.

475
00:41:09,513 --> 00:41:14,177
There it is, R4, right where it
should be. Our missing planet Kamino.

476
00:41:14,284 --> 00:41:16,115
[Whistling, Beeping ]

477
00:41:43,647 --> 00:41:47,481
[ Thunder Rumbling ]

478
00:41:52,355 --> 00:41:55,222
Master Jedi.

479
00:41:55,325 --> 00:41:57,691
The prime minister
is expecting you.

480
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:01,329
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

481
00:42:02,365 --> 00:42:04,492
He is anxious
to meet you.

482
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:06,762
After all these years...

483
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,499
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

484
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:12,802
Now, please, this way.

485
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:28,090
May I present Lama Su...

486
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:30,250
prime minister of Kamino.

487
00:42:31,995 --> 00:42:34,190
And this is Master Jedi--

488
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:36,197
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

489
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:39,598
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

490
00:42:41,037 --> 00:42:43,005
Please.

491
00:42:44,674 --> 00:42:46,869
And now to business.

492
00:42:46,977 --> 00:42:50,913
You will be delighted
to hear that we are on schedule.

493
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:53,915
200,000 units
are ready...

494
00:42:54,017 --> 00:42:56,383
with a million more
well on the way.

495
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,454
That's good news.

496
00:42:59,556 --> 00:43:02,719
Please tell
your Master Sifo-Dyas...

497
00:43:02,826 --> 00:43:06,159
that his order
will be met on time.

498
00:43:06,262 --> 00:43:08,253
I'm sorry. Master--

499
00:43:08,365 --> 00:43:13,234
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still
a leading member of the Jedi Council...

500
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:15,236
is he not?

501
00:43:15,338 --> 00:43:19,138
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

502
00:43:19,242 --> 00:43:23,110
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

503
00:43:23,213 --> 00:43:27,479
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

504
00:43:28,585 --> 00:43:31,247
- The army?
- Yes.

505
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:36,018
A clone army, and I must say,
one of the finest we've ever created.

506
00:43:36,126 --> 00:43:38,117
Tell me, Prime Minister...

507
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:40,719
when my master
first contacted you about the army...

508
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,957
did-- did he say
who it was for?

509
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:45,091
Of course he did.

510
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:47,863
This army
is for the Republic.

511
00:43:47,971 --> 00:43:52,340
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

512
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,969
That's why I'm here.

513
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,926
We used to come here
for school retreat.

514
00:44:20,704 --> 00:44:22,797
We would swim
to that island every day.

515
00:44:24,107 --> 00:44:26,075
I love the water.

516
00:44:30,814 --> 00:44:34,841
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

517
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:37,920
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

518
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,486
I don't like sand.

519
00:44:43,593 --> 00:44:47,552
It's coarse and rough
and irritating...

520
00:44:47,664 --> 00:44:49,632
and it gets everywhere.

521
00:44:51,835 --> 00:44:54,429
Not like here.

522
00:44:54,537 --> 00:44:56,505
Here, everything is soft...

523
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:00,802
and smooth.

524
00:45:37,413 --> 00:45:39,643
No.
[ Gasps ]

525
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:41,774
I shouldn't have done that.

526
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,488
I'm sorry.

527
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:02,964
- Very impressive.
- I'd hoped you would be pleased.

528
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:08,600
[ Lama Su ]
Clones can think creatively.

529
00:46:08,711 --> 00:46:12,613
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

530
00:46:16,586 --> 00:46:21,785
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

531
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:25,258
This group was created
about five years ago.

532
00:46:25,361 --> 00:46:27,420
[ Obi-Wan ] You mentioned
growth acceleration.

533
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,464
[ Lama Su ]
Oh,yes, it's essential.

534
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:32,592
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

535
00:46:32,702 --> 00:46:35,296
Now we can do it
in half the time.

536
00:46:35,405 --> 00:46:38,067
[ Obi-Wan ]
I see.

537
00:46:38,174 --> 00:46:40,074
[ Lama Su ]
They are totally obedient...

538
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:42,872
taking any order
without question.

539
00:46:42,979 --> 00:46:45,038
We modified
their genetic structure...

540
00:46:45,148 --> 00:46:48,345
to make them less independent
than the original host.

541
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:51,011
And who was
the original host?

542
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,213
A bounty hunter
called Jango Fett.

543
00:46:54,791 --> 00:46:56,918
And where is
this bounty hunter now?

544
00:46:57,026 --> 00:46:59,153
Oh, we keep him here.

545
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:04,664
[ Lama Su ] Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

546
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:07,258
Fett demanded
only one thing:

547
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,964
an unaltered clone
for himself.

548
00:47:10,073 --> 00:47:12,507
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

549
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:15,134
[ Lama Su ]
Pure genetic replication.

550
00:47:15,245 --> 00:47:18,408
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

551
00:47:18,514 --> 00:47:21,039
and no growth acceleration.

552
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:24,449
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

553
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:27,785
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

554
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:48,208
Magnificent, aren't they?

555
00:47:54,317 --> 00:47:57,286
- I don't know.
- [ Chuckles ]

556
00:47:57,387 --> 00:47:59,548
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

557
00:47:59,656 --> 00:48:02,022
You gonna use one of
your Jedi mind tricks on me?

558
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:04,218
They only work
on the weak-minded.

559
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:08,821
All right.
I was 12.

560
00:48:08,932 --> 00:48:12,163
His name was Palo. We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.

561
00:48:12,268 --> 00:48:15,328
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

562
00:48:15,438 --> 00:48:17,804
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

563
00:48:17,907 --> 00:48:20,171
All right, I get the picture.

564
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:22,176
Whatever happened to him?

565
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:25,247
I went into public service;
he went on to become an artist.

566
00:48:25,348 --> 00:48:29,546
- Maybe he was the smart one.
- You really don't like politicians,
do you?

567
00:48:29,652 --> 00:48:31,813
I like two or three...

568
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:33,980
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

569
00:48:35,491 --> 00:48:37,891
[ Both Chuckle ]

570
00:48:37,994 --> 00:48:40,292
I don't think
the system works.

571
00:48:40,396 --> 00:48:43,297
How would you
have it work?

572
00:48:43,399 --> 00:48:47,859
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

573
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:51,998
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people, and then do it.

574
00:48:52,108 --> 00:48:54,042
That's exactly
what we do.

575
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:56,134
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

576
00:48:56,245 --> 00:48:58,145
Well, then they
should be made to.

577
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:02,149
- By whom? Who's gonna make them? You?
- I don't know. Someone.

578
00:49:02,251 --> 00:49:04,583
- Of course not me.
- But someone.

579
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:06,587
Someone wise.

580
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:10,489
Sounds an awful lot like
a dictatorship to me.

581
00:49:11,995 --> 00:49:14,225
Well, if it works.

582
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,132
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

583
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:25,799
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

584
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:46,284
[ Creature Bellowing ]

585
00:49:46,396 --> 00:49:49,297
[ Anakin ]
Whoa, whoa!
[ Laughing ]

586
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:53,994
- [ Bellowing ]
- Oh, whoa! [ Grunting ]

587
00:49:55,638 --> 00:49:58,072
- [ Lowing ]
- [ Grunts, Groans ]

588
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:08,476
Ani! Ani, are you all right?

589
00:50:08,584 --> 00:50:12,076

[ Beeping ]

Boba, is your father here?

593
00:50:44,687 --> 00:50:46,746
Boba, is your father here?

594
00:50:46,856 --> 00:50:48,790
Yep.

595
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:50,950
May we see him?

596
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,893
Sure.

597
00:50:55,498 --> 00:50:57,625
Dad, Taun We's here.

598
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,705
[ Thunder Rumbling ]

599
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:13,509
Jango, welcome back.

600
00:51:13,616 --> 00:51:15,550
Was your trip productive?

601
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:17,585
Fairly.

602
00:51:17,687 --> 00:51:21,521
This is Jedi Master
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

603
00:51:21,624 --> 00:51:24,650
He's come to check
on our progress.

604
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,627
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

605
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,756
I'm just a simple man
trying to make my way in the universe.

606
00:51:30,867 --> 00:51:34,564
Ever made your way as far into
the interior as Coruscant?

607
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:37,571
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

608
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:41,343
Possibly.

609
00:51:41,444 --> 00:51:43,605
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

610
00:51:48,217 --> 00:51:50,208
Uh, Boba,
rood eht so-heeck.

611
00:51:51,954 --> 00:51:54,787
Master who?

612
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:56,916
[ Obi-Wan ]
Sifo-Dyas.

613
00:51:57,026 --> 00:51:59,654
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

614
00:52:02,598 --> 00:52:04,498
Never heard of him.

615
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,538
Really?

616
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:13,803
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

617
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:16,105
Curious.

618
00:52:19,382 --> 00:52:22,317
Do you like your army?

619
00:52:22,418 --> 00:52:24,386
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

620
00:52:25,788 --> 00:52:29,019
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

621
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:31,286
Thank you for
your time,Jango.

622
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:35,155
Always a pleasure
to meet a Jedi.

623

[ Thunder Rumbling ]

624
00:52:53,816 --> 00:52:55,784
What is it, Dad?

625
00:52:58,154 --> 00:53:00,179
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

626
00:53:04,927 --> 00:53:09,421
And when I got to them, we went into
aggressive negotiations. Thank you.

627
00:53:09,532 --> 00:53:11,591
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

628
00:53:11,701 --> 00:53:14,761
Uh, well, negotiations
with a lightsaber.

629
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:17,839
- [ Laughing ] Oh.
- [ Laughing ]

630
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:31,278
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

631
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:02,845
From the moment
I met you...

632
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:06,477
all those years ago...

633
00:54:06,589 --> 00:54:09,581
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

634
00:54:12,328 --> 00:54:15,263
And now that
I'm with you again...

635
00:54:15,364 --> 00:54:17,457
I'm in agony.

636
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:24,738
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

637
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,274
The thought of
not being with you--

638
00:54:27,376 --> 00:54:29,435
I can't breathe.

639
00:54:34,383 --> 00:54:39,286
I'm haunted by the kiss
that you should never have given me.

640
00:54:39,388 --> 00:54:41,686
My heart is beating...

641
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:44,760
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

642
00:54:46,929 --> 00:54:49,830
You are in my very soul...

643
00:54:49,932 --> 00:54:51,991
tormenting me.

644
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:57,962
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

645
00:55:08,918 --> 00:55:12,513
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

646
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,290
I can't.

647
00:55:17,393 --> 00:55:20,453
We can't.
It's...just not possible.

648
00:55:20,563 --> 00:55:23,532
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

649
00:55:23,632 --> 00:55:26,226
No, you listen.

650
00:55:26,335 --> 00:55:29,930
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

651
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:33,702
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm-- I'm a senator.

652
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:38,070
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

653
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:40,671
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

654
00:55:41,951 --> 00:55:44,181
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

655
00:55:44,286 --> 00:55:46,311
Then you do feel something.

656
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:49,448
I will not let you
give up your future for me.

657
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:51,719
You are asking me
to be rational.

658
00:55:52,862 --> 00:55:55,092
That is something
I know I cannot do.

659
00:55:55,197 --> 00:56:00,100
Believe me, I wish that I could
just wish away my feelings...

660
00:56:00,202 --> 00:56:02,830
but I can't.

661
00:56:02,938 --> 00:56:05,668
I will not give in to this.

662
00:56:12,782 --> 00:56:15,012
Well, you know, it...

663
00:56:15,117 --> 00:56:17,915
wouldn't have to
be that way.

664
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,887
We could keep it a secret.

665
00:56:22,324 --> 00:56:24,315
We'd be living a lie...

666
00:56:24,427 --> 00:56:26,725
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

667
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,094
I couldn't do that.

668
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:33,100
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

669
00:56:35,037 --> 00:56:38,063
No. You're right.

670
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:41,510
It would destroy us.

671
00:56:49,018 --> 00:56:53,216
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

672
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:56,416
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

673
00:56:56,525 --> 00:56:59,653
it will take more time
to grow them.

674
00:56:59,762 --> 00:57:03,459
- I won't forget, and thank you.
- Thank you.

675
00:57:19,315 --> 00:57:21,579
- R4!
- [ Beeping ]

Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

677
00:57:25,421 --> 00:57:29,619
[ Beeping ]

678
00:57:31,894 --> 00:57:35,193
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

679
00:57:35,297 --> 00:57:39,199
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

680
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:41,792
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

681
00:57:41,904 --> 00:57:43,997
is the assassin
we are looking for.

682
00:57:44,106 --> 00:57:48,270
Do you think these cloners
are involved in the plot
to assassinate Senator Amidala?

683
00:57:48,377 --> 00:57:51,278
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.

684
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:54,281
[ Yoda ] Do not assume
anything, Obi-Wan.

685
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:57,375
Clear your mind must be...

686
00:57:57,486 --> 00:58:01,650
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

687
00:58:01,757 --> 00:58:03,657
Yes, Master.

688
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:06,785
They say Master Sifo-Dyas
placed an order for a clone army...

689
00:58:06,896 --> 00:58:10,491
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.

690
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:16,198
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

691
00:58:16,305 --> 00:58:19,832
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

692
00:58:19,942 --> 00:58:24,208
No. Whoever placed that order
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

693
00:58:24,313 --> 00:58:27,942
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

694
00:58:29,285 --> 00:58:32,186
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

695
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:37,689
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

696
00:58:37,793 --> 00:58:39,693
we could not see.

697
00:58:39,795 --> 00:58:41,786
[ Sighs ]

698
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:45,324
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

699
00:58:45,434 --> 00:58:48,403
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

700
00:58:48,504 --> 00:58:52,634
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

701
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:55,005
If informed the senate is...

702
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:57,578
multiply our adversaries will.

00:58:59,181 --> 00:59:01,581
No.

Don't. No.

No.

708
00:59:35,017 --> 00:59:37,076
Don't go.

709
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:41,089
I don't want to disturb you.

710
00:59:42,424 --> 00:59:44,392
Your presence is soothing.

711
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:49,355
You had another nightmare
last night.

712
00:59:50,566 --> 00:59:53,399
Jedi don't have nightmares.

713
00:59:53,502 --> 00:59:55,493
I heard you.

714
01:00:00,442 --> 01:00:02,433
I saw my mother.

She is suffering, Padmé.

716
01:00:09,985 --> 01:00:13,182
I saw her as clearly
as I see you now.

[ Deep Sigh ]

718
01:00:23,632 --> 01:00:25,657
She is in pain.

719
01:00:28,137 --> 01:00:31,504
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

720
01:00:31,607 --> 01:00:33,632
but I have to go.

721
01:00:36,578 --> 01:00:38,569
I have to help her.

722
01:00:40,315 --> 01:00:42,215
I'll go with you.

business is business, huh?

Yeah, I sold her to
a moisture farmer named, uh, Lars.

At least I think
it was Lars.

00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:57,725
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1247
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:01,703
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1248
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:06,237
[ Beeping ]

1249
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:22,156
- [ Padmé Yells ]
- [ Anakin ] Padmé!

1250
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:27,756
- Put the ship down!
- Anakin!

1251
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:31,631
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way! Follow that speeder!

1252
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:40,074
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1253
00:54:40,177 --> 00:54:43,635
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1254
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:46,774
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1255
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:49,148
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1256
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:52,484
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1257
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:56,253
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1258
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:01,922
She would do her duty.

1259
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,561
Hmm.

1260
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:12,967
The droid army
is in full retreat.

1261
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:16,171
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1262
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:46,302
[ Anakin ] You're gonna pay for all
the Jedi that you killed today, Dooku.

1263
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:49,174
- We'll take him together.
Go in slowly on the left.
- I'm taking him now!

1264
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,646
No, Anakin! No! No!

1265

[ Anakin Screams ]

1266
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,847
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1267
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:04,928
Now... back down.

1268
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:11,028
I don't think so.

1269
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:27,078
Master Kenobi,
you disappoint me.

1270
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:30,278
Yoda holds you
in such high esteem.

1271
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,189
Surely you can do better.

1272
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,292
[ Moaning ]

00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,170
Are you all right?

1275
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:50,740
Uh-huh.

1276
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:54,538
- We'd better get back to
the forward command center.
- No. No.

1277
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:58,172
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1278
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:01,410
- Get a transport. Hurry!
- Right away.

1279
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,489
[ Moaning ]

1280
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:17,333
Ah! Ahh!

1281
00:57:23,507 --> 00:57:26,442
[ Anakin Shouts ]

1282
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:29,570
Brave of you, boy.

1283
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,910
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1284
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:34,246
- I am a slow learner.
- Anakin!

1285
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:35,975
[ Grunting ]

1286
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:41,017
- Master Yoda.
- Count Dooku.

1287
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:44,451
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1288
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,565
[ Growling ]

1289
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:19,119
Powerful you have become,
Dooku.

1290
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:22,283
The dark side I sense in you.

1291
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:25,226
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1292
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:29,124
Even you.

1293
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:46,407
Much to learn you still have.

1294
00:59:46,517 --> 00:59:51,511
It is obvious that
this contest cannot be decided
by our knowledge of the Force...

1295
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:56,718
but by our skills
with a lightsaber.

1296

[Yelling ]

1297
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:41,695
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

1298
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:44,501
This is just the beginning.

The Force is with us,

Welcome home,

You have done well.

I have good news
for you, my lord.

- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

Everything is going
as planned.

1310
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,849
[ Obi-Wan ] Do you believe
what Count Dooku said...

1311
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,189
about Sidious
controlling the senate?

1312
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,559
It doesn't feel right.

Joined the dark side
Dooku has.

Mmm. Lies, deceit...

01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:03,797
creating mistrust
are his ways now.

1316
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:08,241
[ Windu ] Nevertheless, I feel we
should keep a closer eye on the senate.

1317
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,370
I agree.

1318

Where is your apprentice?

01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:17,385
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1320
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:22,819
I have to admit that
without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1321
01:04:22,926 --> 01:04:24,985
[ Yoda ]
Victory?

1322
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:28,223
Victory, you say?

1323
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:32,063
Master Obi-Wan,
not victory.

1324
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:36,835
The shroud of the dark side
has fallen.
