What happened, meter maid?

Okay. Press Conference 101.

1623
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,281
You wanna look smart?

1624
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,720
Answer their question
with your own question...

1625
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,930
and then answer that question. Like this.

1626
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:42,525
"Excuse me. Officer Hopps...

1627
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,444
"uh, what can you tell us about the case?"

1628
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,205
"Well, was this a tough case?

1629
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,368
"Yes. Yes, it was." You see?

1630
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,324
You should be there with me.

1631
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,800
We did this together.

1632
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,129
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

1633
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,402
Hmm. Funny you should say that...

1634
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,881
because I've been thinking...

1635
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,563
It would be nice to have a partner.

1636
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,170
Here. In case you need
something to write with.

1637
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,000
BOGO: At twenty-two hundred hours...

1638
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,650
we found all these missing animals...

1639
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,247
(WHISPERS) Officer Hopps, it's time.

1640
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,806
BOGO: They appear to be
in good health, physically..

1641
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,206
- (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
- ...ifnot emotionally

1642
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,362
So now, I'll turn things over...

1643
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,285
to the officer who cracked the case.

1644
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,210
- Officer Judy Hopps.

- Officer Hopps!
- Officer Hopps!

1647
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,841
MALE PRESS BEAVER: Over here!

1648
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:36,882
Yes?

1649
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,605
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

1650
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,408
(STAMMERS) Well, the animals
in question, um...

1651
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,568
Are they all different species?

1652
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,723
Yes. Yes, they are.

1653
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,123
FEMALE PRESS ANIMAL: Okay,
so what is the connection?

1654
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,328
Oh, all we know is that they...

1655
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,050
are all members of the predator family.

1656
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:01,251
So, predators are
the only ones going savage?

1657
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,007
That is ac... Yes, that is accurate. Yes.

1658
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,520
- (ALL CLAMORING)
- Why? Why is this happening?

1659
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:06,841
We still don't know.

1660
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,441
It may have something to do with biology.

1661
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,846
SHEEP REPORTER: What do you mean by that?

1662
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,043
A biological component.

1663
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,568
You know, something in their DNA.

1664
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,641
In their DNA? Can you
elaborate on that, please?

1665
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,766
Yes, what I mean is,
thousands of years ago...

1666
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,971
uh, predators survived through
their aggressive...

1667
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,844
hunting instincts.

1668
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,007
For whatever reason...

1669
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,329
they seem to be reverting back...

1670
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,380
to their primitive, savage ways.

1671
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,447
MALE PRESS ANIMAL: Of course they did.

1672
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,683
JUNIOR RANGER SCOUT: Aw, is he gonna cry?

1673
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,763
MALE PRESS ANIMAL: Officer
Hopps, could it happen again?

1674
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,811
It is possible. So we must be vigilant.

1675
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,607
And we at the ZPD are prepared
and are here to protect you.

1676
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,046
FEMALE PRESS ANIMAL:
Will more mammals go savage?

1677
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,406
What is being done to protect us?

1678
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,761
FEMALE PRESS ANIMAL: Have you considered

1679
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,041
a mandatory quarantine on predators?

1680
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,770
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.

1681
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,405
Uh, that's all the time that we have.

1682
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:04,766
No more questions.

(CLAMORING CONTINUES)

1684
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,580
(WHISPERS) Was I okay?

1685
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,887
Oh, you did fine.

1686
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,740
Oh, that went so fast.

1687
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,046
I didn't get a chance to mention you...

1688
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,247
or say anything about how we...

1689
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,926
Oh, I think you said plenty.

1690
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,601
What do you mean?

1691
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,241
"Clearly there's a biological component?"

1692
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,046
"These predators may be reverting back...

1693
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,282
"to their primitive, savage ways?"

1694
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,045
Are you serious?

1695
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,727
I just stated the facts of the case.

1696
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,247
I mean, it's not like
a bunny could go savage.

1697
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,289
Right. But a fox could, huh?

1698
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,807
Nick, stop it. You're not like them.

1699
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:40,844
Oh, there's a "them" now?

1700
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,127
Ugh. You know what I mean.

1701
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,685
You're not that kind of predator.

1702
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,331
The kind that needs to be muzzled?

1703
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:46,846
The kind that makes you think...

1704
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,480
you need to carry around fox repellent?

1705
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:50,740
Yeah, don't think I didn't...

1706
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,366
notice that little item
the first time we met.

1707
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,803
So let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

1708
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,767
Do you think I might go nuts?

1709
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,089
Do you think I might go savage?

1710
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:05,380
Do you think I might try to...

1711
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:06,527
eat you?

1712

I knew it. (SCOFFS)

01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,321
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me, huh.

1715
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,246
Probably best if you don't
have a predator as a partner.

1716
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,168
- No. Nick. Nick!

No, he's my friend.

in this city gripped by fear.

by a savage polar bear.

This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week...

01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,009
after ZPD Officer Judy Hopps
connected the violence...

to traditionally predatory animals.

This is not the Zootopia I know

if a predator such as myself...

wasn't the first face that you see...

You're a hero to them. They trust you.

want you to be the public face of the ZPD.

Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.

With all due respect, sir, a good cop...

for the way I behaved in my youth.

and it manifested itself...

Oh, Gid's talking about
those flowers, Judy.
