clear the water out...

Amen.

156
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,746
Yeah, let's eat.

157
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,414
I didn't know
Hindus said "amen."

158
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,815
Catholic Hindus do.

159
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,817
Catholic Hindus?

160
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,954
We get to feel guilty
before hundreds of gods,

(CHUCKLES)
But you're a Hindu first?

162

None of us knows God
until someone introduces us.

163
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,097
I was first
introduced to God
as a Hindu.

164
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,633
There are 33 million gods
in the Hindu religion.

165
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,368
How can I not
come to know

168
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,110
Yashoda once accused
baby Krishna of eating dirt.

169
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,982
"Tut, tut you naughty boy -
you shouldn't do that."

170
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,218
But he didn't!

171
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,988
That's what he told her.

172
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,856
"I didn't eat dirt."

173
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,960
Yashoda said,
"No? Well then..."

174
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,296
"Open your mouth."

175
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,199
So Krishna opened his mouth.

176
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,234
And what do you
think Yashoda saw?

177
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,436
What?

178
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:32,277
She saw in Krishna's mouth
the whole entire universe.

I brought you this.

207
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,908
Why would a god do that?

208
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,211
Why would
He send His own son...

209
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:56,647
to suffer for the sins
of ordinary people?

210
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,349
Because He loves us.

211
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,086
God made Himself
approachable to us,

212
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,989
human,
so we could understand Him.

213
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,658
We can't understand God
in all His perfection.

214
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,495
But we can
understand God's son

215
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:13,131
and His suffering
as we would a brother's.

216

That made no sense.

Sacrificing the innocent
to atone for the sins
of the guilty...

What kind of love

why would He want
to create all this?

223
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:40,591
Why does He
need us at all?

224
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:44,328
All you have to know
is that He loves us.

You only need to convert

(RAVI LAUGHING)

Are you going to
Mecca this year,

GITA: You stay
out of this, Ravi.

Just as you like cricket,
Pi has his own interests.

252
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,246
No, Gita,
Ravi has a point.

253
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:46,284
You cannot follow
three different religions
at the same time, Piscine.

254
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:48,085
Why not?

255
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:51,856
Because believing
in everything
at the same time...

256
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:55,259
is the same as not believing
in anything at all.

257
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,663
He's young, Santosh.
He's still finding his way.

258
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:02,867
And how can he find his way
if he does not choose a path?

259

Listen, instead of leaping
from one religion
to the next...

260
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,839
why not start with reason?

261
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,676
In a few hundred years...

262
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,312
science has taken us
farther in understanding
the universe...

in 10,000.

That is true.

265

Your father is right.

266
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,723
Science can teach us
more about what
is out there...

267
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,425
but not what is in here.

268
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,729
Some eat meat,
some eat vegetable.

269
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,131
I do not expect us all
to agree about everything...

270
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,933

rather have you

believe in something
I don't agree with...

272

than to accept
everything blindly.

273
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,442
And that begins
with thinking rationally.

274
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,578
Do you understand?

275
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,482
Good.

282
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,508

Faith is a house

But no room

Oh, plenty.

Doubt is useful.

It keeps faith
a living thing.

287

After all,
you cannot know
the strength of your faith

Richard Parker

Yeah, he got his name
through a clerical error.

297

A hunter caught him
drinking from a stream

00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,554
and named him Thirsty.

When Thirsty got too big,
the hunter sold him
to our zoo...

some chemical process

turned the water

acid that dissolved
those fish...

Years ago, some poor fellow,

thought he might

taken on.

eventually he died

digested him...

<i>He left and</i>
<i>returned with a group</i>
<i>who carried me away.</i>

940
01:45:47,074 --> 01:45:48,741
(SOBBING)

941
01:45:48,743 --> 01:45:51,644
<i>I wept like a child.</i>

942
01:45:51,646 --> 01:45:56,882
<i>Not because I was overwhelmed</i>
<i>at having survived,</i>
<i>although I was.</i>

943
01:45:56,884 --> 01:46:02,555
<i>I was weeping</i>
<i>because Richard Parker</i>
<i>left me so unceremoniously.</i>

944
01:46:04,224 --> 01:46:06,559
<i>It broke my heart.</i>

945
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:15,301
You know,
my father was right.

946
01:46:15,303 --> 01:46:19,004
Richard Parker never
saw me as his friend.

947
01:46:19,006 --> 01:46:22,375
After all
we had been through,
he didn't even look back.

948
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:25,745
But I have to believe
there was more in his
eyes...

949
01:46:25,747 --> 01:46:28,914
than my own reflection
staring back at me.

950
01:46:28,916 --> 01:46:30,916
I know it.
I felt it.

951
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:33,986
Even if I can't prove it.

952
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:41,293
You know,
I've left so much behind.

953
01:46:41,295 --> 01:46:45,398
My family, the zoo,
India, Anandi.

954
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:48,801
I suppose, in the end,
the whole of life becomes
an act of letting go.

955
01:46:49,870 --> 01:46:52,838
But what always
hurts the most...

956
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:56,108
is not taking a moment
to say goodbye.

957
01:46:58,278 --> 01:47:02,548
I was never able
to thank my father
for all I learned from him.

958
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:06,051
To tell him,
without his lessons...

959
01:47:06,053 --> 01:47:08,020
I would never
have survived.

960
01:47:10,791 --> 01:47:14,260
I know Richard Parker
is a tiger,
but I wish I had said...

961
01:47:14,262 --> 01:47:17,229
"It's over.
We survived.

962
01:47:17,231 --> 01:47:21,066
"Thank you
for saving my life.
I love you, Richard Parker.

963
01:47:21,068 --> 01:47:23,602
"You will always
be with me.

964
01:47:25,272 --> 01:47:27,506
"May God be with you."

965
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:36,916
I don't know
what to say.

966
01:47:43,657 --> 01:47:45,858
It's hard to believe,
isn't it?

967
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:51,730
It is a lot to take in.

968
01:47:51,732 --> 01:47:54,767
To figure out
what it all means.

969
01:47:54,769 --> 01:47:55,835
If it happened,
it happened.

970
01:47:55,837 --> 01:47:58,137
Why should it have
to mean anything?

971
01:47:59,973 --> 01:48:03,175
Some of it is
pretty incredible.

972
01:48:03,177 --> 01:48:06,512
See, I was the only one
who survived the shipwreck.

973
01:48:06,514 --> 01:48:09,548
So the Japanese
shipping company sent
two men to talk to me...

974
01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:11,951
in the Mexican hospital
where I was recovering.

975
01:48:14,321 --> 01:48:15,955
I still have a copy
of their report.

976
01:48:18,592 --> 01:48:21,727
They had insurance claims
to settle...

977
01:48:21,729 --> 01:48:24,230
and they wanted to find out
why the ship sank.

978
01:48:25,565 --> 01:48:26,799
They didn't
believe me, either.

979
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:34,139
Thousands of meerkats
on a floating
carnivorous island...

980
01:48:34,141 --> 01:48:36,242
and no one
has ever seen it?

981
01:48:36,244 --> 01:48:39,178
Yes, just like I told you.

982
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,913
Bananas don't float.
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

983
01:48:40,915 --> 01:48:42,748
Why are you talking
about bananas?

984
01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:45,518
You said the orangutan
floated to you
on a bundle of bananas.

985
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:47,553
But bananas don't float.

986
01:48:47,555 --> 01:48:49,021
Are you sure about that?

987
01:48:49,023 --> 01:48:52,925
Of course they do.
Try it for yourself.

988
01:48:52,927 --> 01:48:57,162
In any case, we are not here
to talk about bananas
or meerkats.

989
01:48:57,164 --> 01:49:00,699
Look, I've just
told you a long story
and I'm very tired.

990
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:05,471
We are here because
a Japanese cargo ship
sank in the Pacific.

991
01:49:05,473 --> 01:49:07,706
Something I never forget.

992
01:49:09,075 --> 01:49:11,210
I lost my whole family.

993
01:49:16,116 --> 01:49:17,650
Get him some water.

994
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,288
We don't mean
to push you.

995
01:49:23,924 --> 01:49:26,692
And you have our
deepest sympathies.

996
01:49:26,694 --> 01:49:29,361
But we have come
a long way...

997
01:49:29,363 --> 01:49:32,197
and we are no closer
to understanding
why the ship sank.

998
01:49:32,199 --> 01:49:34,667
Because I don't know.

999
01:49:34,669 --> 01:49:36,502
I was asleep.
Something woke me up.

1000
01:49:36,504 --> 01:49:38,804
It could have
been an explosion,
I can't be sure.

1001
01:49:38,806 --> 01:49:41,574
And then the ship sank.

1002
01:49:41,576 --> 01:49:43,275
What else do you
want from me?

1003
01:49:43,277 --> 01:49:45,778
A story that won't make us
look like fools.

1004
01:49:45,780 --> 01:49:48,847
We need a simpler story
for our report.

1005
01:49:48,849 --> 01:49:51,350
One our company
can understand.

1006
01:49:51,352 --> 01:49:53,652
A story
we can all believe.

1007
01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:59,325
So, a story without things
you've never seen before.

1008
01:50:00,126 --> 01:50:01,794
That's right.

1009
01:50:01,796 --> 01:50:05,764
Without surprises.
Without animals
or islands.

1010
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:08,334
Yes. The truth.

1011
01:50:17,243 --> 01:50:19,812
So, what did you do?

1012
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:26,218
I told them
another story.

1013
01:50:27,387 --> 01:50:29,555
Four of us survived.

1014
01:50:29,557 --> 01:50:32,491
The cook and the sailor
were already aboard.

1015
01:50:32,493 --> 01:50:34,593
The cook threw me a lifebuoy
and pulled me aboard...

1016
01:50:34,595 --> 01:50:37,630
and Mother held on to
some bananas and made it
to the lifeboat.

1017
01:50:39,332 --> 01:50:42,368
The cook was
a disgusting man.

1018
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:45,237
He ate a rat.

1019
01:50:45,239 --> 01:50:48,273
We had food enough for weeks,
but he found the rat
in the first few days...

1020
01:50:48,275 --> 01:50:51,944
and he killed it,
dried it in the sun
and ate it.

1021
01:50:51,946 --> 01:50:54,013
He was such a brute,
that man.

1022
01:50:55,949 --> 01:50:59,218
But he was resourceful.

1023
01:50:59,220 --> 01:51:03,155
It was his idea to build
the raft to catch fish.

1024
01:51:03,157 --> 01:51:05,891
We would have died in
those first few days
without him.

1025
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:13,332
The sailor was the same man
who brought rice and gravy,
the Buddhist.

1026
01:51:13,334 --> 01:51:17,102
We didn't understand
much of what he said,
only that he was suffering.

1027
01:51:17,104 --> 01:51:19,438
He had broken his leg
horribly in the fall.

1028
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:23,075
We tried to set it
as best we could, but
the leg became infected...

1029
01:51:23,077 --> 01:51:27,746
and the cook said that
we had to do something
or he'd die.

1030
01:51:27,748 --> 01:51:29,014
The cook said
he'd do it,

1031
01:51:29,016 --> 01:51:31,417
but Mother and I had
to hold the man down.

1032
01:51:31,419 --> 01:51:33,752
And I believed him,
we needed to do it.

1033
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:36,155
So...

1034
01:51:38,058 --> 01:51:41,627
I kept saying,
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

1035
01:51:41,629 --> 01:51:44,963
And he just
kept looking at me.
His eyes were so...

1036
01:51:48,435 --> 01:51:51,470
I'll never
understand the point
of that man's suffering.

1037
01:51:52,839 --> 01:51:56,175
I can still hear him.

1038
01:51:56,177 --> 01:51:59,311
The happy Buddhist,
he only ate rice and gravy.

1039
01:52:04,918 --> 01:52:06,752
We didn't save him,
of course.

1040
01:52:06,754 --> 01:52:08,187
He died.

1041
01:52:09,789 --> 01:52:12,224
The morning after,
the cook caught
his first dorado...

1042
01:52:12,226 --> 01:52:15,060
and I didn't understand
what he had done at first,
but Mother did...

1043
01:52:15,062 --> 01:52:17,796
and I had never seen
Mother so angry.

1044
01:52:18,965 --> 01:52:21,200
"Stop whining and
be happy," he said.

1045
01:52:21,202 --> 01:52:24,069
"We need more
food or we'll die.
That was the whole point."

1046
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:26,205
"What was the whole point?"
Mother asked.

1047
01:52:26,207 --> 01:52:29,875
"You let that poor boy
die in order to get bait,
you monster!"

1048
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:32,911
The cook got furious.

1049
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:35,214
He started towards her
with his fist raised...

1050
01:52:35,216 --> 01:52:37,950
and Mother slapped him hard,
right across the face.

1051
01:52:37,952 --> 01:52:40,252
I was stunned.

1052
01:52:40,254 --> 01:52:42,387
I thought he was going
to kill her right then.

1053
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:45,758
But he didn't.

1054
01:52:48,027 --> 01:52:50,262
The cook didn't stop
at bait either, no.

1055
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:53,098
The sailor...

1056
01:52:55,235 --> 01:52:57,169
He went the same
way the rat went.

1057
01:53:00,273 --> 01:53:02,374
The cook was
a resourceful man.

1058
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:08,847
It was a week later
that he...

1059
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:13,252
Because of me.

1060
01:53:13,254 --> 01:53:16,688
Because I couldn't
hold on to a stupid turtle.

1061
01:53:16,690 --> 01:53:19,525
It slipped out of my hands
and swam away.

1062
01:53:19,527 --> 01:53:21,927
And the cook came up
and he punched me on
the side of my head...

1063
01:53:21,929 --> 01:53:24,129
and my teeth clacked
and I saw stars.

1064
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:25,831
I thought he was
going to hit me again...

1065
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:27,533
but Mother started
pounding on him
with her fists...

1066
01:53:27,535 --> 01:53:29,601
screaming,
"Monster, monster!"

1067
01:53:29,603 --> 01:53:30,969
She yelled at me
to go to the raft.

1068
01:53:30,971 --> 01:53:33,105
(SPEAKING TAMIL)

1069
01:53:33,107 --> 01:53:35,407
I thought she
was coming with me,
or I'd never have...

1070
01:53:38,912 --> 01:53:41,046
I don't know why
I didn't make her
go first.

1071
01:53:43,349 --> 01:53:45,317
I think about that
every day.

1072
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:55,093
I jumped over
and turned back just
as the knife came out.

1073
01:53:59,299 --> 01:54:01,433
There wasn't anything
I could do.

1074
01:54:03,536 --> 01:54:05,304
I couldn't look away.

1075
01:54:09,809 --> 01:54:12,044
He threw her body overboard.

1076
01:54:14,047 --> 01:54:17,449
And then the sharks came.
And I saw what they...

1077
01:54:22,322 --> 01:54:23,922
I saw.

1078
01:54:30,163 --> 01:54:34,266
The next day,
I killed him.

1079
01:54:34,268 --> 01:54:36,935
He didn't even fight back.
He knew he had gone
too far...

1080
01:54:36,937 --> 01:54:38,937
even by his
own standards.

1081
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:42,708
He'd left the knife
out on the bench,

1082
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:45,477
and I did to him what
he did to the sailor.

1083
01:54:48,514 --> 01:54:51,483
He was such an evil man,
but worse still, he...

1084
01:54:53,853 --> 01:54:56,255
He brought
the evil out in me.

1085
01:54:57,991 --> 01:55:00,125
And I have to
live with that.

1086
01:55:07,066 --> 01:55:09,501
I was alone
in a lifeboat...

1087
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:13,272
drifting across
the Pacific Ocean.

1088
01:55:14,007 --> 01:55:15,908
And I survived.

1089
01:55:21,547 --> 01:55:24,850
PI: After that,
they had no more
questions.

1090
01:55:24,852 --> 01:55:29,421
The investigators
didn't seem to like
the story, exactly.

1091
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:33,392
But they thanked me,
they wished me well,
and they left.

1092
01:55:40,166 --> 01:55:42,267
So the stories...

1093
01:55:45,338 --> 01:55:47,306
both the zebra
and the sailor...

1094
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:50,542
broke their leg.

1095
01:55:50,544 --> 01:55:53,979
And the hyena
killed the zebra
and the orangutan.

1096
01:55:53,981 --> 01:55:58,283
So... the hyena is the cook.

1097
01:55:58,285 --> 01:56:01,186
The sailor
is the zebra.

1098
01:56:01,188 --> 01:56:03,889
Your mother
is the orangutan.

1099
01:56:03,891 --> 01:56:07,025
And you are...

1100
01:56:07,894 --> 01:56:10,228
the tiger.

1101
01:56:14,367 --> 01:56:16,068
Can I ask you something?

1102
01:56:17,637 --> 01:56:20,105
Of course.

1103
01:56:20,107 --> 01:56:23,976
I've told you two stories
about what happened
out on the ocean.

1104
01:56:23,978 --> 01:56:27,512
Neither explains what caused
the sinking of the ship...

1105
01:56:27,514 --> 01:56:31,583
and no one can prove
which story is true
and which is not.

1106
01:56:31,585 --> 01:56:35,220
In both stories,
the ship sinks...

1107
01:56:35,222 --> 01:56:37,656
my family dies
and I suffer.

1108
01:56:38,191 --> 01:56:39,591
True.

1109
01:56:42,528 --> 01:56:44,463
So, which story
do you prefer?

1110
01:56:52,205 --> 01:56:54,206
The one with the tiger.

1111
01:56:55,308 --> 01:56:57,409
That's the better story.

1112
01:57:00,847 --> 01:57:02,481
Thank you.

1113
01:57:03,282 --> 01:57:05,484
And so it goes with God.

1114
01:57:17,296 --> 01:57:19,131
Mamaji was right.

1115
01:57:20,233 --> 01:57:22,367
It's an amazing story.

1116
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:25,971
Will you really
let me write it?

1117
01:57:25,973 --> 01:57:27,839
Of course.

1118
01:57:27,841 --> 01:57:30,642
Isn't that why Mamaji
sent you here, after all?

1119
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:33,245
(CAR APPROACHING)

1120
01:57:34,847 --> 01:57:37,015
My wife is here.

1121
01:57:37,017 --> 01:57:39,151
Do you want to
stay for dinner?
She's an incredible cook.

1122
01:57:39,153 --> 01:57:40,218
I didn't know
you had a wife.

1123
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:42,287
And a cat
and two children.

1124
01:57:43,189 --> 01:57:45,290
So, your story does
have a happy ending.

1125
01:57:45,892 --> 01:57:48,894
Well, that's up to you.

1126
01:57:48,896 --> 01:57:51,229
The story is yours now.

1127
01:57:51,231 --> 01:57:52,531
(CHUCKLES)

1128
01:58:02,942 --> 01:58:04,409
(DOOR OPENING)

1129
01:58:06,546 --> 01:58:09,081
Hmm.

1130
01:58:09,083 --> 01:58:13,285
"Mr. Patel's is
an astounding story
of courage and endurance...

1131
01:58:13,287 --> 01:58:16,488
"unparalleled
in the history
of shipwrecks.

1132
01:58:16,490 --> 01:58:20,525
"Very few castaways can
claim to have survived
so long at sea...

1133
01:58:20,527 --> 01:58:23,295
"and none in the company...

1134
01:58:23,297 --> 01:58:25,730
"of an adult Bengal tiger."

1135
01:58:28,267 --> 01:58:30,368
BOY: Hi, Dad.

1136
01:58:30,370 --> 01:58:32,604
PI: We have a guest.
Let me introduce you.

1137
01:58:33,706 --> 01:58:35,073
Hi.
Hi.

1138
01:58:35,075 --> 01:58:36,475
Nice to meet you.

1139
01:58:36,477 --> 01:58:37,576
Adita.

1140
01:58:38,711 --> 01:58:39,678
Ravi.
