01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,162
Soon everything
we knew will be gone.

941
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,970
All that is left of Creation
will lie within these walls.

942
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,646
Outside,

943
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,647
just the waters of chaos again.

944
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,005
You are angry.

945
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,810
You judge me.

946
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,810
Let me tell you a story.

947
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,935
The first story
my father told me,

948
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,770
and the first story
that I told each of you.

949
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,804
In the beginning,

950
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,166
there was nothing.

951
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,489
<i>Nothing but the silence
of an infinite darkness.</i>

952
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,208
<i>But the breath of The Creator
fluttered against</i>

953
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,885
<i>the face of the void,
whispering,</i>

954
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,050
<i>"Let there be light. "</i>

955
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,011
<i>And light was.</i>

956
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,846
<i>And it was good.</i>

957
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,731
<i>The first day.</i>

958
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,688
<i>And then the formless light</i>

959
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,371
<i>began to take on
substance and shape.</i>

960
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,210
<i>A second day.</i>

961
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,244
<i>And our world was born.</i>

962
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:06,167
<i>Our beautiful, fragile home.</i>

963
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,245
<i>And a great, warming light
nurtured its days.</i>

964
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,161
<i>And a lesser light
ruled the nights.</i>

965
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,644
<i>And there was evening.
And morning.</i>

966
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,685
<i>Another day.</i>

967
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:23,881
<i>And the waters of the world
gathered together,</i>

968
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,603
<i>and in their midst
emerged dry land.</i>

969
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,604
<i>Another day passed.</i>

970
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,720
<i>And the ground put forth
the growing things.</i>

971
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,015
<i>A thick blanket of green</i>

972
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,008
<i>stretching across all Creation.</i>

973
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,850
<i>And the waters, too,
teemed with life.</i>

974
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:43,881
<i>Great creatures of the deep
that are no more.</i>

975
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,043
<i>Vast multitudes of fish,</i>

976
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:49,363
<i>some of which may still
swim beneath these seas.</i>

977
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,606
<i>And soon the sky
was streaming with birds.</i>

978
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,086
<i>And there was evening.</i>

979
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,965
<i>And there was morning.
A fifth day.</i>

980
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,924
<i>Now the whole world
was full of living beings.</i>

981
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,601
<i>Everything that creeps,
everything that crawls,</i>

982
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,603
<i>and every beast
that walks upon the ground.</i>

983
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,127
<i>And it was good.
It was all good.</i>

984
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,735
<i>There was light
and air and water</i>

985
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,127
<i>and soil,
all clean and unspoiled.</i>

986
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,967
<i>There were plants and fish
and fowl and beast,</i>

987
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,645
<i>each after their own kind.</i>

988
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,240
<i>All part of the greater whole.
All in their place.</i>

989
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:23,564
<i>And all was in balance.
It was paradise.</i>

990
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,888
<i>A jewel in The Creator's palm.</i>

991
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,801
<i>Then The Creator made Man.
And by his side, Woman.</i>

992
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:34,284
<i>Father and mother of us all.</i>

993
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,960
<i>He gave them a choice.</i>

994
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:42,968
<i>Follow the temptation
of darkness</i>

995
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,850
<i>or hold on to the
blessing of light.</i>

996
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,168
<i>But they ate from
the forbidden fruit.</i>

997
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,642
<i>Their innocence
was extinguished.</i>

998
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,324
<i>And so for the ten generations
since Adam, sin</i>

999
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:08,649
<i>has walked within us.</i>

1000
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,969
<i>Brother against brother.</i>

1001
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,648
<i>Nation against nation.</i>

1002
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,209
<i>Man against Creation.</i>

1003
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,009
<i>We murdered each other.</i>

1004
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,131
<i>We broke the world.
We did this.</i>

1005
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:30,329
<i>Man did this.</i>

1006
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:33,162
<i>Everything that was beautiful,</i>

1007
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,323
<i>everything that was good,</i>

1008
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,365
<i>we shattered.</i>

1009
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,206
<i>Now,</i>

1010
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:42,889
<i>it begins again.</i>

1011
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,723
Air, water, earth, plant,
fish, bird and beast.

1012
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,249
Paradise returns.

1013
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,885
But this time,

1014
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:57,004
this time there will be no men.

1015
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,207
If we were to enter
the Garden again,

1016
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,041
it would only be
to destroy it once more.

1017
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,521
No.

1018
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,082
The Creator has judged us.

1019
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:11,763
Mankind must end.

1020
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,241
Shem and Ila,

1021
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,524
you will bury your mother and I.

1022
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,731
Ham, you will bury them.

1023
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,761
Japheth will lay you to rest.

1024
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,570
You, Japheth,

1025
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:31,762
you will be the last man.

1026
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,404
And in time you, too,
will return to the dust.

1027
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,922
Creation will be left alone,

1028
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:40,282
safe and beautiful.

1029
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,083
I'm very sorry about that girl.

1030
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,204
And I'm sorry for you.

1031
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:52,415
But we have been entrusted with a task

1032
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:54,761
much greater than our own desires.

1033

He needed something greater.
Something

Because I failed Him.

1414
02:06:03,040 --> 02:06:04,963
And I failed all of you.

1415
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:10,325
Did you?

1416
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:18,242
He chose you for a reason, Noah.

1417
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,480
He showed you
the wickedness of man

1418
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:24,001
and knew you would
not look away.

1419
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:27,887
But then you saw goodness, too.

1420
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:33,245
The choice was put in your
hands because He put it there.

1421
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,846
He asked you to decide
if we were worth saving.

1422
02:06:40,080 --> 02:06:43,004
And you chose mercy.

1423
02:06:46,360 --> 02:06:47,850
You chose love.

1424
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:55,290
He has given us a second chance.

1425
02:06:56,520 --> 02:06:58,249
<i>Be a father.</i>

1426
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:02,042
<i>Be a grandfather.</i>

1427
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:06,407
<i>Help us to do better this time.</i>

1428
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:11,203
<i>Help us start again.</i>

1429

02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:22,851
The Creator

1434
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:25,842
made Adam in His image,

1435
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,362
and placed the world
in his care.

1436
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:30,725
That birthright

1437
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:34,370
was passed down to us.

1438
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,689
To my father, then to me,
and to my sons,

1439

Shem,

and Ham.

1442
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,601
That birthright
is now passed to you,

1443
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:09,041
our grandchildren.

1444
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:15,609
This will be your work,

1445
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:21,082
and your responsibility.

1446
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:23,244
So I say to you,

1447
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:27,563
be fruitful and multiply

1448
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:31,562
and replenish the earth.
