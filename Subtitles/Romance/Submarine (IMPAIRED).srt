1
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,271
(Waves crashing)

2
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,671
(Seagulls cry)

3
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,074
BOY: Most people
think of themselves as individuals,

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,636
that there's no-one on the planet like them.

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,716
This thought motivates them
to get out of bed,

6
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,194
eat food, and walk around
like nothing's wrong.

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,629
My name is Oliver Tate.

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,711
# ALEX TURNER: Stuck On The Puzzle (lntro)

9
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,675
# I'm not the kind of fool
who's gonna sit and sing to you

10
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,628
# About stars, girl

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,230
# But last night I looked up

12
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,239
# lnto the dark half of the blue

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,313
# And they'd gone backwards

14
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,557
TEACHER: "What kind of young person am l? "

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,639
That's the challenge. We talk about challenges.

16
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,638
Well, that's the challenge
I'm giving you this term.

17
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,671
A gauntlet, so to speak.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,757
But this gauntlet is also an opportunity.

19
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,156
An opportunity for self-discovery.

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,078
What do I mean by "self-discovery"?
Mark Pritchard?

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,834
- Having a wank, sir?
- (Suppressed laughter)

22
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,269
Discovery of the self.

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,631
Who am l?

24
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,989
OLlVER:
I find that the only way to get through life

25
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,396
is to picture myself
in an entirely disconnected reality.

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,949
I often imagine
how people would react to my death.

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,268
Mr Dunthorne's quavering voice
as he makes the announcement.

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,800
The shocked faces of my classmates.

29
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,073
A playground bedecked with flowers.

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,793
The empty stillness of a school corridor.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,479
Local news analysis.

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,718
Oliver Tate was a popular
and much-loved pupil.

33
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,594
Many of the people I've spoken to here
referred to him as an example.

34
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,790
He was so funny and so smart..

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,479
He's gonna be really missed.
It's so bad. He's so young.

36
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,112
OLlVER: Tear-streaked tributes.

37
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,072
(Sobbing muffles speech)

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,908
I just wanted to hug him. I just wish I had.

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,078
I wish I could have said goodbye,
but I never said anything to him.

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,076
OLlVER: The steady stoicism of my parents.

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,554
All the girls liked him.

42
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,594
Other boys respected him,
looked up to him, I guess.

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,189
Candlelit vigils.

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,678
We are witnessing incredible,
unprecedented scenes of quiet devotion.

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,999
Behind me a vigil that's been repeated
all over the country.

46
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,238
A testimony to the love felt for Oliver Tate

47
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,238
and the loss felt by his friends...

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,512
and, frankly, by Wales on the whole.

49
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,435
And, finally, my glorious resurrection.

50
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,832
Don't ask how. Just know
that I'm now more powerful than ever.

51
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,196
OLlVER: Let's get off.

52
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,830
(Whispers) Zoe.

53
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,238
Zoe, this is for you. It's yours.
It has your name on it. Take it.

54
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,077
- It's not mine.
- Please take it.

55
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,078
That note seems fascinating, Oliver Tate.

56
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,475
You know the rules. Stand up and read it out.

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,399
I can't. It's Zoe's.
She gave it to me and I was gonna...

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,317
(Bell rings)

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,318
Saved by the bell once again, Mr Tate.

60
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,839
All right, take your time.

61
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,350
I know you're all gagging
to get to double Biology but don't rush.

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,593
Jordana Bevan's only real flaws
are her sporadic bouts of eczema.

63
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,237
Other than that, she has many qualities.

64
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,633
She never speaks about herself.
She could be anything.

65
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,036
Perhaps she's a Fabian.

66
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,958
That would make her a socialist
who advocates gradual change.

67
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,558
She's moderately unpopular, which makes
a romance between us more likely.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,151
She's also a girl - to be seen with her
would improve my street cred,

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,872
which, though high, could be higher.

70
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,796
Lastly, she's now single,

71
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,710
cos Mark Pritchard cheated on her
with Abby Smuts at the school disco.

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,514
The full extent of the betrayal
is still the subject of speculation.

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,433
Chips knows there's
nothing more attractive than a bully.

74
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,110
He also knows that Zoe Preece
is a legitimate target

75
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,072
because she's overweight
and won't accept notes in class.

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,270
Essentially, I disapprove of bullying.

77
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,076
Jordana seems to enjoy it in moderation.

78
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,957
I must not let my principles
stand in the way of progress.

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,436
I must be willing to adapt.

80
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,719
Keep up, Tubs!

81
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,191
This was the correct decision.

82
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,798
Give it back now!

83
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,835
This was a vivid memory of youth that l
would cherish when I was old and frail.

84
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,108
Oh!

85
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,957
Catch. Straight into the hands.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,310
We were working as a team,
testing each other's limits,

87
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,989
challenging one another's bourgeois
assumptions of what was acceptable.

88
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,110
ZOE: Oh, grow up! Grow up!

89
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,670
I knew that these events - although
hard to bear at this precise moment -

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,157
would help build Zoe Preece's
character in the long term.

91
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,749
Aargh!

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,911
(They laugh)

93
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,151
Wanker!

94
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,959
(Mouths)

95
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,112
Honestly, Zoe, it was an accident.

96
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,916
I mean, it was just unlucky
that you were there and that you fell in.

97
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,430
We were playing...sort of like a game.

98
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,954
And you can replace the stuff
that was in your bag.

99
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,358
- I'm not saying it's cheap...
- Fuck off and die!

100
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,149
In many ways, I prefer my own company.

101
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,477
It gives me time to think.

102
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,149
I suppose it's a bit of an affectation,
but I often read the dictionary.

103
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,159
My word for today is "flagitious",
which means wickedly shameful.

104
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,195
I live in a large house with my parents.

105
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,279
They tell me that our area
has breathtaking scenery.

106
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,950
I'm not sure I believe in scenery.

107
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,119
However, the views allow me
to spy on our new neighbours.

108
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,552
I don't know them yet
but they seem like terrible human beings.

109
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,352
Ninjas.

110
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,840
My parents have not had sex
for seven months.

111
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,790
I've been monitoring their intimacy
via the dimmer switch in their bedroom.

112
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,869
I know when they've been at it
because the dial will be set to halfway.

113
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,631
I wish life could be more like
American soap operas.

114
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,275
Then, whenever things got dramatic,

115
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,949
you could just fade the picture down
and pick things up again later.

116
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,309
Can you tell your mother to hurry up?
I'll be waiting in the road.

117
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,834
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

118
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,919
Yeah, you look good for your age. For a mum.

119
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,111
Mum's getting the bus.

120
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,393
MAN: So...I inherited it all.

121
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,353
Well, er, it's been terrific. Small world, all that.

122
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,311
It's such a lovely area.

123
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,828
This used to be Jill's grandmother's house,
right?

124
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,916
Yes.

125
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,839
The hours we spent up in that room,
listening to records, hatching plans.

126
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,758
Right, yes.
So are you going to be selling up?

127
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,075
Just gonna let things take their own path.

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,269
- You have a good day, Lloyd.
- OK, cheers, Graham.

129
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,631
- Give my love to Jill.
- Will do.

130
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,591
- Ciao, Lloyd.
- Goodbye.

131
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,751
- You go get 'em, killer.
- I will.

132
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,273
As usual, Dad drops me 800 yards from school.

133
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,429
That way, I can slip in unnoticed, like a torpedo.

134
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,357
Watch your step, motherfucker! Ha-ha

135
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,153
You've got to wake up.
How many times have I told you?

136
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,997
- Ellis?
- Yes, sir.

137
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,758
- Griffiths?
- Here, sir.

138
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,233
- Harris?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,838
- Davies?
- Yes, sir.

140
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,552
- Morris?
- Sir.

141
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,033
Preece?

142
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,514
Preece? Anyone seen Zoe?

143
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,269
- Tate?
- Yeah, present.

144
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,756
- Pritchard?
- Yes.

145
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,199
Smuts?

146
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,312
Wanker!

147
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,115
Zoe Preece hasn't been in school for a while,

148
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,994
so I've written a pamphlet
on how to break out of the victim cycle.

149
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,753
I've also given her two examples to inspire her.

150
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,792
Firstly, Rhydian Bird,

151
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,752
who pulled his trousers down to fart.
and followed through,

152
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,394
calling an unhealthy turd onto the tarmac.

153
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,513
But instead of looking embarrassed,
he screamed with laughter and pointed.

154
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,915
Nobody could tease him about it
cos he was so proud.

155
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,712
How do you even know all men read poems?

156
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,075
All men do, unless you're gay. Are you gay?

157
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,588
Secondly, Chips.
He wasn't even considered hot

158
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,916
until the Watkins twins stabbed him
in the back with compasses.

159
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,235
He said nothing, showed no discomfort.

160
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,589
as his shirt. blossomed with blood poppies.

161
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,916
His stoicism reminded me of the brave men
who died in the First World War.

162
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,037
Chips is an outstanding bully.

163
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,029
He once made our Religious Education teacher
cry using only Blu-Tack.

164
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,638
Right, now, now, now.

165
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,192
I don't quite know what I am yet.

166
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,631
I've tried smoking a pipe...

167
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,398
.. flipping coins...

168
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,113
Iistening exclusively to French crooners.

169
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,958
Other times I go to the beach
and stare at the sea.

170
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,798
Someone made a documentary
about a prominent thinker

171
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,831
who struggled with unspeakable loss.

172
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,792
I've even had a brief hat phase.
But nothing stuck.

173
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,112
- Gene.
- What?

174
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,596
The most secure route to Zoe is big Gene,

175
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,235
who, over the last few months,
has become her only friend and confidante.

176
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,236
Gene told me that Zoe had moved schools.

177
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,432
She was very unhappy because she was bullied
and one boy even pushed her into a pond.

178
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,357
Oh... I had no idea.

179
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,437
I persuaded her to give Zoe the pamphlet
by saying it was a love letter.

180
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,959
It's a big love letter.

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,956
I've got a big heart.

182
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,992
Sometimes I wish there was a film crew
following my every move.

183
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,112
I imagine the camera craning up
as I walk away.

184
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,878
But, unless things improve,

185
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,799
the biopic of my life will only have
the budget for a zoom out.

186
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,070
I feel bad, cutting into his head.

187
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,238
Why? It's just a fucking frog.

188
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,191
It's still a thing, though. It had life.

189
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,231
Where do you think they get the frogs?

190
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,396
I don't know.
Probably a lake or a river nearby.

191
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,829
They probably have a guy that does it.
I could find out.

192
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,996
- I don't actually want to know.
- Neither do l.

193
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,679
- I'm just saying. You asked...
- I wonder where Fat is.

194
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,869
- Zoe?
- Mm.

195
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,878
- She hasn't been in school for a while.
- I hadn't noticed.

196
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,036
I thought you would have.
She leaves a big gap.

197
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,513
She's not on my radar.

198
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,233
- Is it cos we pushed her into the pond?
- I didn't push her.

199
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,590
- Think she's weeping herself to death?
- I didn't push her.

200
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,198
Maybe you should write to her.

201
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,995
Maybe you should write her
a pamphlet or something.

202
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,873
What do you think?

203
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,559
What is this?

204
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,753
What do you want from me?

205
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,636
Meet me under the railway bridge after school
and we'll take it from there.

206
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,675
JORDANA:
Bring a Polaroid camera and a diary.

207
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,879
OK?

208
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,151
(Train clatters by overhead)

209
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,399
- Got the camera and the diary?
- Do you have the pamphlet?

210
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,876
Give me the camera.

211
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,631
OK.

212
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,353
Now kneel down.

213
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,633
Please, Jordana... What is this?

214
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,796
Kneel down.

215
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,713
Close your eyes.

216
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,598
(Train clattering)

217
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,355
We kissed until our lips felt swollen.

218
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,315
Her mouth tasted of milk, Polo mints
and Dunhill lnternational.

219
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,995
OK. Now take out the diary
and write today's date.

220
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,913
Write a few paragraphs on how excited
you are to have kissed me.

221
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,830
Mention what a dick Mark Pritchard is
and slag off Abby Sluts.

222
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,474
- It's Smuts.
- Let's call her Sluts.

223
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,273
I sit next to her in Geography, so we're mates.

224
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,197
I don't need your life story.

225
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,871
Wow. You look mentally retarded.

226
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,992
Have you ever kissed anyone before?

227
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,431
I had in fact only kissed
one person before - Zoe Preece.

228
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,997
It was after the Cowboys And lndians
school disco.

229
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,077
I told her if we were going to do it,
we had to hide behind the refectory.

230
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,315
Her tongue was blue
from blackcurrant squash.

231
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,157
It smouldered in the cold.

232
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,113
OK, I've done it.

233
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,035
Good.

234
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,391
- Can I have the pamphlet now?
- No.

235
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,796
- What will you do with the photos?
- Leave them lying around school.

236
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,717
For people to accidentally find.

237
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,193
Oh.

238
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,832
What are you complaining about?

239
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,599
This is conclusive proof
that you might not be gay.

240
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,598
CHlLDREN: Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

241
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,598
Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord! Gaylord!

242
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,919
Come on, gay boy, take back
what you said about me!

243
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,078
I take it back. I take it back.

244
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,839
And admit that you're in fact a gaylord.

245
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,836
(Jeering)

246
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,871
No. Do not admit it.

247
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,354
- Do not admit that.
- Shut up, Chips.

248
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,470
Fine. I'm gay. I'm very gay.

249
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,431
(Shouting and laughter)

250
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,838
And Jordana's a slut.

251
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,593
- Jordana is a slut.
- No.

252
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,598
Say it. Say it!

253
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,198
No.

254
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,716
Don't be a dick, Mark. Just let him go.

255
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,676
Fine. I'll let him go.

256
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,591
I'll let him go.

257
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,918
If...he admits you're a slut.

258
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,871
- Ooh.
- Just say it, gay boy.

259
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,717
Say it.

260
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,119
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Fucking big gay.

261
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,236
I was completely overbalanced.

262
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,275
It was luck. I'm gonna get him for this.
I'll bring him so much pain.

263
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,595
Probably catch him like he caught me,
on the sly.

264
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,671
Blood.

265
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,513
- Are you gonna get up now?
- Yeah. Sorry, yeah.

266
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,148
- You've got scaly hands.
- It's eczema.

267
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,594
Now that we had kissed
for non-blackmail purposes,

268
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,032
I thought it gentlemanly
to escort. Jordana home.

269
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,436
When there, I asked if
she was my girlfriend now. And she said:

270
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,391
I'll think about it.

271
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,791
But what she meant was, yes.

272
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,391
We are now as one.

273
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,031
(Gulls crying)

274
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,437
Whenever I'm late home from school,

275
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,952
my mother assumes I've been abducted
and left to drown in a lake.

276
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,071
There he is. Oliver?

277
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,109
My mother is worried
that I have mental problems.

278
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,994
I found a book about
teenage paranoid delusions

279
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,634
during a routine search
of my parents' bedroom.

280
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,877
After that, I start.ed slipping choice phrases
into our conversation.

281
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,832
My body has been replaced by a shell.
My organs are made of stone.

282
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,757
- I've been dead for years.
- Right.

283
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,952
My mother is naturally neurotic and in her youth
even dreamed of being an actress.

284
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,959
Until she was told by a speech therapist
her tongue was too big for her mouth.

285
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,118
Now she works for the council's Legal
and Democratic Services depart.ment.

286
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,313
(Photocopier whirs)

287
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,830
One of the rules in her office

288
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,916
- is that if it's your birt.hday...
- Ta-da.

289
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,599
..you are held responsible
for bringing your own cake to work.

290
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,596
- Happy birthday, Jill.
- Thank you.

291
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,393
Oliver?

292
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,751
Oliver, come here.

293
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,279
Come here.

294
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,591
Where are you going, Oliver?

295
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,918
OK, sit up.

296
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,629
- Are you being victimised again?
- No. I'm never victimised.

297
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,752
You were, in primary school and Cubs.

298
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,950
- I don't remember.
- I do. There was a lot of crying.

299
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,831
- Is it drug related?
- How?

300
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,791
- I don't know. You tell me.
- It's not.

301
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,751
- Your pupils are huge.
- It's dark.

302
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,598
- Is it self-harm?
- Why would I punch myself in the eye?

303
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,393
- I really don't know.
- I wouldn't. This is stupid.

304
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,193
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me the truth.

305
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,551
OK, I got into a fight.

306
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,434
I was defending the honour of my girlfriend.

307
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,993
OK, fine.

308
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,031
You're not being serious, it's fine.

309
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,991
No, I am. I have a girlfriend now.

310
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,951
- Really?
- Yeah.

311
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,479
- Do you?
- Yeah.

312
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,033
- Really?
- Yeah.

313
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,991
Of course.

314
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,395
Yes, of course. I mean, why wouldn't... I didn't...

315
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,352
- Did you think I was...
- No, I didn't. Come here.

316
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,311
(She grunts)

317
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,874
What a lovely little chat. You're doing so well.

318
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,155
So?

319
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,511
K-nock, k-nock, can I come in?

320
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,949
This was the happiest
I'd seen my fatherfor years.

321
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,871
Not too long ago, I discovered
an empty bottle of anti-depressants,

322
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,959
during another routine search
of my parents' bedroom.

323
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,037
My research indicates it all start.ed
when he was sacked from his job

324
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,036
presenting on the Open University.

325
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,991
My father is a marine biologist,

326
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,998
and introduced a segment
called Mysteries Of The Deep.

327
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,951
But he was an uneasy screen presence

328
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,468
and never knew quite what to do with his hands.

329
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,434
After his dismissal,
he spent several days in bed,

330
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,713
drinking hot lemon from the same mug
and never washing it,

331
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,751
a key sign of one of his downturns.

332
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,916
Now he works at the local university,

333
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,951
doing a job he finds difficult to explain

334
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,878
to anyone without
a degree-level knowledge of fish.

335
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,111
Listen, I hope you don't mind.

336
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,472
But your mother informs me
that you have a girlfriend.

337
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,875
Is there anything I can help you with there?

338
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,717
I'm not sure yet. I'll let you know.

339
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,398
OK. All right.

340
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,317
Yes. Er...Iisten...

341
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,749
I know you think I'm very boring, you know.

342
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,598
But once...I ripped my vest off
in front of a woman

343
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,993
and er...it was very effective, actually.

344
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,475
I know.

345
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,875
It produced a very atavistic response.

346
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,990
That's just something to bear in mind.

347
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,669
And listen, I made you a cassette recording.

348
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,593
It's a compilation of songs I used to listen to
during some of my early formative relationships.

349
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,235
Plus a couple of things I thought you might dig.

350
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,590
I think music can make things seem
a bit more real, sometimes,

351
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,471
- if you know what I mean.
- Thanks.

352
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,557
I've also included some break-up songs
towards the end,

353
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,194
just in case things don't work out.

354
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,075
Which, obviously, you know, that isn't the aim,
though, I'm gonna tell you, it is likely.

355
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,391
Passion rarely lasts, I'm afraid.

356
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,871
All right, well...

357
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,153
good night and erm...well done!

358
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,919
It's an achievement. It really is, of sorts.

359
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,995
Good night, son.

360
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,519
# Tomorrow I'll be quicker

361
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,357
# I'll stare into the strobe light flicker

362
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,598
# And afloat I'll stay

363
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,956
# But I'm quite all right hiding today

364
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,033
# Tomorrow I'll be faster

365
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,711
# I'll catch what I've been chasing after

366
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,038
# And have time to play

367
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,355
# But I'm quite all right hiding today

368
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,078
# And I will play the coconut shy

369
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,998
# And win a prize even if it's rigged

370
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,113
# I won't know when to stop

371
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,230
# And you can leave off my lid

372
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,831
# And I won't even lose my fizz

373
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,274
# I'll be the polka dots type

374
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,910
# I'll know the way back if you know the way

375
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,519
# But if you are, I am quite all right

376
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,956
# Hiding today

377
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,230
Jordana and I enjoyed a glorious
atavistic fort.night of lovemaking,

378
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,955
humiliating teachers and bullying the weak.

379
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,356
I've already turned these moments
into the Super-8 footage of memory.

380
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,678
# Tomorrow I'll be stronger

381
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,351
# Running colourful

382
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,475
# No longer just in black and white

383
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,992
# And quite all right hiding tonight

384
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,754
# And I will have a game on the coconut shy

385
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,916
# And win a prize even if it's rigged

386
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,956
# I won't know when to stop
and you can leave off my lid

387
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,834
# And I won't even lose my fizz

388
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,237
# I'll be the polka dots type

389
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,750
# I'll probably swim through a few lagoons

390
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,111
# I'll have a spring in my step

391
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,958
# And I'll get there soon

392
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,037
# To sing you a happy tune

393
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,991
# Tomorrow

394
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,829
# And you'd better bring a change of clothes

395
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,234
# So we can sail our laughing pianos

396
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,835
# Along a beam of light

397
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,789
# But I'm quite all right hiding tonight

398
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,275
It's fucking ridiculous! How long's it been?

399
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,438
Two weeks. It's fucking ridiculous!

400
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,516
I'm not bothered. We've as good as done it.

401
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,552
Never take more than a week
between everything but and stuffing it in.

402
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,477
She's taking the piss. Keiron, back me up.

403
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,476
- She's taking the piss, man.
- Thank you.

404
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,431
Watch out, she's looking.

405
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,111
Is she still looking?

406
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,073
Yep.

407
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,832
Jordana hates any place
that could be termed romantic.

408
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,511
With this in mind, I took her to
one of my favourite industrial estates,

409
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,471
for some quality one-on-one time.

410
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,671
This is nice, isn't it?

411
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,991
JORDANA: Yeah, it's not bad.

412
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,000
OLlVER:
I mean, you know, we get on pretty well.

413
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,471
JORDANA: Yeah, it's fun.

414
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,909
And we're getting more and more intimate.

415
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,475
Intimate?

416
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,557
Yeah, you know, we've done things.
We've been intimate.

417
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,031
We have been intimate, yeah.

418
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,194
My parents are going to the cinema
on Thursday.

419
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,393
It's a tradition. They go every Thursday evening.

420
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,351
So what I'm saying is, it's empty.

421
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,115
The house. On Thursday. The house is empty.

422
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,835
On Thursday evening, it's an empty house.

423
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,791
So what do you think?

424
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,638
Are you asking me to come round
and have sex with you?

425
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,831
If I say yes, does that lessen
the chance of you wanting to?

426
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,678
Before I answer that,
I just want to check one thing.

427
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,188
- Yeah, sure. What is it?
- It's quite serious.

428
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,074
Of course, yeah. Go ahead, you should
be able to ask what you want to ask.

429
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,232
Will the house be empty?

430
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,791
Write down the reasons why I should.

431
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,355
OK.

432
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,238
It's Thursday. You're going to the cinema?
You should leave.

433
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,557
Is that what you wear to lounge around?

434
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,795
Your father doesn't want to go out
all of a sudden.

435
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,912
I've been looking forward to it.
I didn't realise there'd be others.

436
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,394
- They're our neighbours.
- Who, the ninjas?

437
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,034
It's Thursday, our cinema night.
It's not a free-for-all.

438
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,674
Do not call them ninjas, Oliver. It's racist.

439
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,948
He's white.

440
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,195
They don't strike me as big Eric Rohmer fans.

441
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,391
Why don't the three of you just go and see
some tat at the Odeon?

442
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,237
- I'll just stay in.
- You should both go.

443
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,191
- So rude, Lloyd.
- (Doorbell)

444
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,238
(Rings again)

445
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,591
Oh, for God's sake.

446
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,591
- Oh, Graham.
- Whoa!

447
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,996
- Oh, not really...
- Hey.

448
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,917
- Oh, thanks.
- (Chuckles)

449
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,871
Are you all right?

450
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,993
- Whoargh!
- (Giggles)

451
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,759
You look lovely.

452
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,234
- Thank you very much.
- Sorry I'm a bit early.

453
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,909
It's just, there's a fantastic
noodle bar right next to the cinema.

454
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,315
Kim-Lin and I would love to take
you and Lloyd...

455
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,237
- Ninjas.
- My treat.

456
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,794
- Very sweet.
- No need to take two cars, right?

457
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,398
Plenty of room in the van.

458
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,829
Do you mind jumping in the back, here, Lloyd?

459
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,799
Hop right in there,
make yourself comfortable.

460
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,191
All right there, buddy? Great.

461
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,671
(Van starts)

462
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,631
(Clock ticking)

463
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,991
(Wind howling)

464
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,039
(Doorbell rings)

465
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,031
Thanks for living up a fucking hill.

466
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,918
Sorry, I had to er...go to the toilet.

467
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,511
I'm OK now. It doesn't matter.

468
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,949
Just gonna top this up quickly.

469
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,671
There we go.

470
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,668
To us, and a wonderful evening of lovemaking.

471
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,792
Can you just get off my shoulders?

472
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,151
I'm just directing you, just...

473
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,230
Right, OK, just don't open them.
I'll tell you when. Stay there.

474
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,511
- What, now?
- Yeah.

475
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,516
Fucking hell, you're a serial killer.

476
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,398
I'm sorry for that.
I didn't know whether you'd like it.

477
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,149
But we can learn from it. I've learned from it.

478
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,351
I think you've learned from it.
Maybe we could start again.

479
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,198
- I've gotta go home.
- OK, cool. You should go home.

480
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,279
I'll give you this. It's just a letter
I was gonna give you. Just take it.

481
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,231
It's nothing.

482
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,836
- Sorry, but...
- No, no, l... Yeah...

483
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,191
- You...
- OK, bye.

484
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,832
Dear Jordana, thank you for letting me
explore your perfect body.

485
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,474
I could drink your blood.

486
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,671
You're the only person I would allow
to be shrunk to microscopic size

487
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,995
and swim inside me
in a tiny submersible machine.

488
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,793
We've lost our virginity
but it wasn't like losing anything.

489
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,833
You're too good for me.
You're too good for anyone. Sincerely, Oliver.

490
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,951
Don't get cocky.

491
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,231
(Wind howls)

492
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,511
- (Door slams)
- How was the film?

493
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,359
I'm going to bed.

494
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,960
It's nice to see something lightweight
once in a while,

495
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,513
that you don't have to think about.

496
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,312
Relationships are tough, aren't they?

497
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,511
You should be in bed, Oliver.

498
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,830
Tonight, I stumbled across
an encyclopaedia entry on ultrasound.

499
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,034
Ultrasound is a sound vibration
too high frequency to be audible.

500
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,833
It was first developed to locate
submerged objects -

501
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,634
submarines, depth charges, Atlantis and such.

502
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,671
Some animals, like bats, dolphins and dogs

503
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,075
can hear within the ultrasonic frequency.

504
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,156
But no human can.

505
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,873
No-one can truly know
what anyone thinks or feels.

506
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,831
What's inside Mum?

507
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,439
What's inside Dad?

508
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,232
What's inside Jordana?

509
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,758
We're all travelling under the radar, undetected.

510
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,111
And no-one can do a thing about it.

511
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,312
- Any more word from Graham?
- Nothing to report., Jackie.

512
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,433
- We went to the cinema as normal.
- How did that go?

513
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,799
Awkward, of course.

514
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,434
Lloyd sulked
because we watched Crocodile Dundee

515
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,153
rather than one of his dark numbers,
I don't know.

516
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,078
But I really laughed.
I thought it was very charming.

517
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,669
And I could see why someone like her
would go for someone like him.

518
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,156
Graham is still very attractive.
He probably felt threatened.

519
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,158
Lloyd is far too self-involved
to feel threatened, Jackie.

520
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,111
He knows Graham was your first love...

521
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,071
- He wasn't my first love.
- Come on.

522
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,553
- I was 18.
- Pardon?

523
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,989
18. Look, I've got to go. I'll call you back.

524
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,031
Actually, I'll see you tomorrow, OK.

525
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,879
(Hangs up)

526
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,878
Lloyd?

527
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,191
Were you listening in to that?

528
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,551
LLOYD: Sorry, what?

529
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,795
I could hear you breathe, Lloyd.

530
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,312
Why hadn't my parents told me
that Graham was Mum's first love?

531
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,036
No wonder their cinema outing
had ended in such a schism.

532
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,833
I can only assume the subject
of wife-swapping was raised

533
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,711
and Dad didn't feel emotionally ready.

534
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,395
Is it possible that Mum would cheat on Dad?

535
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,513
Will they get divorced?

536
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,234
They don't even row.

537
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,191
They just have discussions.

538
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,480
I'm going to have to increase my surveillance.

539
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,271
Good night, Oliver.

540
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,511
(Wind howls)

541
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,911
(Grunts enthusiastically)

542
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,311
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

543
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,511
Yargh, yargh, yargh!

544
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,154
Yargh!

545
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,071
(Gulls screeching)

546
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,591
Thank you very much, Jeff.

547
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,193
I got you these books.
They're really meaningful to me.

548
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,757
This is Shakespeare's most mature work,
miles better than Hamlet.

549
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,552
Just more developed thematically.

550
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,275
And this is Nietzsche, one of the most
influential philosophers of modern time.

551
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,312
I don't agree with all he says
but he makes some interesting points.

552
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,909
And this is The Catcher In The Rye,
a great modern American novel.

553
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,871
Salinger's very influential.

554
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,433
Why are you doing this?

555
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,995
I thought it'd be nice to get some
mutual interest, now we've had sex,

556
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,349
other than spitting and setting things on fire.

557
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,311
Why would I want to be more like you?

558
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,555
Just try not to crack the spines or burn them.

559
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,956
We should get in. It starts in an hour.
I want to get a good seat.

560
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,276
It's rude to leave a film before it's finished.

561
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,039
- Who to?
- The film-makers.

562
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,513
- How do they know?
- They just do.

563
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,232
- How?
- They do.

564
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,397
- There wasn't even any sound on it.
- There was never intended to be.

565
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,476
- Then why did they write it?
- Kiss me.

566
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,433
(Laughing) Get off me!

567
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,549
- What are you doing?
- Just kiss me.

568
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,116
(Laughing) Get the fuck off me, you freak.

569
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,477
That was fucking ridiculous.

570
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,399
"Kiss me!" Who says that?

571
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,113
- It was a kiss. I tried to be romantic.
- What the fuck?

572
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,628
- You were crushing my face.
- Yeah, in a romantic way.

573
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,079
I'm not in the mood.

574
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,353
It seems pretty clear
that Mum is having an affair.

575
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,156
Why else would she be at the hairdresser's
with Graham the ninja?

576
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,794
He probably makes sure
all his prospective sex part.ners

577
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,116
are salon fresh before impregnating them
with a ninja love child.

578
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:00,876
Cheers.

579
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,230
Mum normally just gets a trim
from her work colleague Jackie.

580
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,437
But now I think of it,
she did mention her hair the other day.

581
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,271
I used to have long hair like her.

582
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,630
Hm?

583
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,591
I used to have long hair, remember?

584
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,551
Hm, yes.

585
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,477
Pretty, isn't she?

586
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,555
I dunno.

587
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,511
Do you like my hair long?

588
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,631
- Er...
- Or short like now?

589
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,110
Well, you know...
I like your hair no matter how long it is.

590
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,278
But did you prefer it long?

591
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,753
Either way's good.

592
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,153
No opinion.

593
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,111
Well, it's up to you.

594
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,720
So it wouldn't bother you if I shaved it all off?

595
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,193
Not if it made you happy.

596
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,310
If you want to shave off your hair, you should.

597
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,352
Why would I shave my hair off, Lloyd?
What a stupid idea.

598
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,914
Yeah.

599
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,310
I can imagine my mum calmly leaving one day
while Dad helps her pack.

600
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,831
So er...got any plans?

601
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,191
No, not really.

602
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,151
No, just...

603
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,111
see how it goes, really.

604
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,429
Are you planning on getting dressed today?

605
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,348
- Do you want to take the car?
- That's fine.

606
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,836
I'm going to work from home today
so if you want to take the car...

607
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,958
I was planning on going to see
one of Graham's talks tonight.

608
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,833
- OK.
- You don't mind?

609
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,633
- Why would I mind?
- It just means I won't be in tonight.

610
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,558
- I'll make sure I keep myself busy.
- Oliver, you coming?

611
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,989
- I'd like a moment with my father.
- Lovely.

612
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,951
I'll see you in the car.

613
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,153
(Turns tap on)

614
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,591
I think Mum might be having an affair.

615
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,551
Can you turn the tap off, please?

616
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,870
I saw her in town with Graham
and heard her on the phone talking about him.

617
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,038
You shouldn't be spying on people.

618
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,356
I just saw them and accidentally
picked up the phone. Aren't you worried?

619
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,755
- Graham's an old friend of Mum's.
- They've met up.

620
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,677
- Yes.
- So you're condoning this affair?

621
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,030
There is no affair. He's just some bloke
I stole your mother from.

622
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,389
So you admit they have a history?

623
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,795
I think you should go to your mother now, OK?

624
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,711
- Thanks, Mum.
- Just a second, we're early.

625
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,071
How are things with Jordana?

626
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,439
Fine.

627
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,234
- You ever going to let us meet her?
- Maybe if you get a terminal illness.

628
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,316
So things are serious between you two?

629
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,955
It may seem like a big deal now
but it probably won't matter when you're my age.

630
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,750
38?

631
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,030
- Just be careful.
- I always use condoms.

632
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,035
Good.

633
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,629
You know that your dad and l
are going through a bit of a tough time.

634
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,990
And I want you to know
we really appreciate you trying to help.

635
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,793
- I'm not trying to help.
- You're a loud whisperer.

636
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,751
You shouldn't spy on people.

637
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,711
Why have you been meeting Graham?

638
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,673
Graham is an old friend and has had
relationship problems with Kim-Lin.

639
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,631
He needed someone he could talk to.

640
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,274
- So he might be single soon?
- Goodbye, Oliver.

641
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,675
- Mum?
- Yes?

642
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,599
Who would you save first in a fire,

643
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,030
given the hypothetical situation
that Dad and I were equally hard to save?

644
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,708
I'd go for you but I'd feel bad for your father.

645
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,957
OK.

646
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,991
- Kiss me!
- What?

647
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,350
(Laughs)

648
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,630
I still can't believe you fucking said it.

649
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,558
I did not say it in a high-pitched...
Iike a little mouse.

650
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,591
- You cried it.
- Come on, we're late.

651
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,152
- That gap gets smaller every day.
- What are you doing tonight?

652
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,318
I'm busy tonight.

653
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,839
Doing what?

654
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,598
As in, I've got stuff to do. Busy.

655
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,234
No, you never have anything to do.
What are you doing?

656
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,751
GRAHAM: What is light?

657
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,913
What is light?

658
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,393
How important is light?

659
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,876
OK, let's think about that for a minute.

660
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,598
Cos it seems very basic and banal but it's not.
It's loaded.

661
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,278
It's a bloody nail bomb.

662
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,430
I think light is probably
the most important gift we have

663
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,791
from the universe.

664
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,991
And if you asked any intelligent bloody writer,

665
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,557
Iike Professor Hawking or anybody of that ilk,

666
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,791
he could talk to you...

667
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,108
for about, I don't know, a year...

668
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,630
just about bloody light!

669
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,270
We don't want to be in the dark,

670
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,517
being fiddled with.

671
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,471
That's for sure.

672
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,431
How's my dad meant to compete?

673
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,391
The only time I saw him enthral a room

674
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,035
was when he gave a talk about
the disappearance of a giant sturgeon.

675
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,913
Sturgeons are royal fish, since the 14th century,

676
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,315
and, if caught,
they do become property of the Crown.

677
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,079
So, yes, we're treating the matter as suspicious.

678
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,671
How deep is the ocean?

679
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:22,272
Seven miles at its deepest point,
but on average, six miles as a rule of thumb.

680
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,311
But no fish could live down there.

681
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,116
There's no light, of course,
and the pressure is far too great.

682
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,674
Any human who found themselves at that level,

683
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,631
well, they would die immediately.

684
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,433
They would implode.
They wouldn't stand a chance.

685
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,391
But in answer to your question,

686
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,795
the ocean is six miles deep.

687
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,517
I am a prism.

688
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,871
That's not mad.

689
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,918
OK? I am a prism, I am light.

690
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,511
I am lucid.

691
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,355
I am exciting and delicious.

692
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,995
Thanks very much for today.
You've been fantastic.

693
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,668
Well done.

694
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,475
- It seemed to go pretty well.
- Oh, yes, yes.

695
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,431
I think they...

696
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,948
- They loved it.
- Did you enjoy it?

697
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,592
Absolutely.

698
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,392
A lot to take in.

699
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,751
- But it was silly, right?
- No, no.

700
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,756
- You think I'm silly?
- No, I don't.

701
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,268
- It's OK.
- I don't. I don't.

702
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,591
I didn't ask for this, Jill.

703
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,511
This gift, it's... It's like a burden to me.

704
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,915
Sure.

705
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,235
Yeah, you must be exhausted.

706
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,351
I split up with Kim-Lin.

707
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,836
Oh, no. Oh, dear.

708
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,711
Let her go.

709
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,035
- She was young, right?
- I'm really sorry.

710
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,992
- It's all good.
- Anyway, I'd better... I'd better go.

711
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,996
- Gonna come next week?
- Er...

712
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,236
- I can?
- You'd better.

713
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,035
Sure. I'll check my diary.

714
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,674
- Bring Lloyd.
- Um...

715
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,631
OK. I don't think it's really...

716
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,438
..his cup of... I'll ask.

717
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,791
If you ask him...

718
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,751
he will come.

719
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,191
- I'll see what I can do.
- Right.

720
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,359
- Thank you again. You're very good.
- Ciao, Jill.

721
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,277
- Watch yourself.
- Thank you.

722
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,071
Bye-bye.

723
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,471
I'm watching you.

724
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,434
And by being in balance
with the colours around them,

725
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,110
with a healthy colour glow around themselves,

726
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,071
they're living a fulfilled life.

727
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,319
So when you're in a crisis, it doesn't
feel like the waves are crashing on you,

728
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,955
it feels like you can just stand
under those waves

729
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,311
and let them do their business,

730
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,354
and then get a towel and bloody dry yourself off,
and go about your day.

731
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,753
That's what it means.

732
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,599
My mum is the exact type of person

733
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,474
who is susceptible to this mystic bullshit.

734
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,317
I can picture her telling Jackie at work

735
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,588
how it's a bit over the top

736
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,198
but there's something in it.

737
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,151
If my dad radiated a colour,

738
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,156
it'd be ochre or eggshell.

739
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,878
He knows the number for the pothole
helpline off by heart..

740
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,198
It's about a foot in diameter.
It's a bit of a concern.

741
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,749
(Whispers) Pothole.

742
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,998
Yes, that's right, Lloyd Tate.
Oh, hi, how are you?

743
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,589
He was the first person in our village
to install double glazing.

744
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,389
It's from Dad.

745
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,751
He ruins every Christmas.

746
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,711
It's a kettle.

747
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,435
Great.

748
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,189
..how extraordinary they are.

749
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,511
Because they've forgotten, right?

750
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,114
OLlVER: Maybe it's time for Dad
to rip off his vest again.

751
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,791
I mean, it's a bit over the top,
but I think there's something in it.

752
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,558
Yes, yes. Good turnout, was it?

753
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,113
I'm going out for a bit.

754
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,955
The question was, do I tell Jordana
about this Graham situation?

755
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,311
I mean, we'd had sex.

756
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,113
Wouldn't it spoil things
if I suddenly got emotional?

757
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,713
I decided to soften the blow
with some light arson.

758
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,470
You don't talk about your parents much.

759
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,799
- I mean, do they get on?
- Yeah, they get on.

760
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,799
Mine get on as well. It's good, isn't it?
It's important that they get on.

761
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,434
So everything's fine at home,
everything's OK?

762
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,436
Cos everything's fine with me.

763
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,316
Actually, my mum's not well at the moment.

764
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,478
They get on, you know.

765
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,033
That's the main thing.

766
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,675
Yeah.

767
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,990
Sorry, did you say your mum wasn't well?

768
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,270
Yeah.

769
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,391
Why, what's wrong?

770
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,111
She's got...

771
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,472
it's called...medulloblastoma.

772
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,232
What does it mean?

773
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,191
It means she's got a brain tumour.

774
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,153
Oh, no.

775
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,469
Confiding in Jordana was now impossible.

776
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,918
Her mother had cancer.

777
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,751
And in the Top Trumps of parental problems,
cancer beats potential infidelity.

778
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,229
I would have to travel this road secretly,

779
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,398
unaided,

780
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,237
a renegade,

781
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,111
a solitary samurai.

782
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,708
# (plays)

783
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,920
Things were a lot less fun since
Jordana's mother might die

784
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:11,033
and my parents' marriage
start.ed falling apart..

785
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,719
I've been working on strategies
to solve both problems.

786
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,150
I bought my dad some new aftershave,
but I'm drawing a blank on the cancer.

787
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,757
CHlP: You're fucked. Even if her mum
is terminal, it can still take ages.

788
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,519
Please, Chip, shut up.

789
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,357
This is not what you signed up for.

790
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,233
This is about dipping your wick.
You've done that, game over.

791
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,396
She'll be in no mood to put out any more.

792
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,919
No more Yuletide logging for you,

793
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,191
unlike me, who shall be rolling in it
throughout the festive period.

794
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,231
Do you actually pre-prepare these lines?

795
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,191
I just split lines as they come to me.

796
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,038
You've got to shut the shit down.
Keiron, get my back.

797
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,957
- With extreme prejudice.
- Thank you.

798
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,197
- Nothing's changed.
- Do what you want. Remember two things:

799
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,117
one - treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen.

800
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,071
Two - don't mix family and bush.

801
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,271
Get the fuck out of here.
Merry Christmas. Have a good 'un.

802
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,393
You all right?

803
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,071
You've gotta shut this shit down.
It's fucking ridiculous.

804
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,871
# ALEX TURNER: Glass In The Park

805
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,148
# If there's glass in the park

806
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,433
# Darling, I can't help but keep

807
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,953
# Making appointments to sweep

808
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,075
# Beneath the climbing frame

809
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,035
# If the sun's in your eyes

810
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,673
# I'll tighten your blindfold, baby

811
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,358
# Don't worry, your foot won't get cut

812
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,156
# Strut carelessly

813
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,519
I've been taking my duty as a boyfriend
seriously.

814
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,758
Last night, I reread the book
I Only Want What's Best For You.

815
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,358
I remembered a chapter that says:

816
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,879
(Reads)

817
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,036
It's therefore in Jordana's interest
that her dog dies before her mother does.

818
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,391
Then we can get things back on track.

819
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,793
(Phone rings)

820
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,997
Oliver Tate.

821
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,351
OK, calm down.

822
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,833
What happened?

823
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,390
There was no need to poison Jordana's dog

824
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,354
because Jordana's dog
had just been hit by a train.

825
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,278
I scraped his remains
into the bin liner I'd brought.

826
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,790
The death of a pet makes it easier
to accept the death of a parent.

827
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,355
I could feel the tension between Jordana and l
start. to slip away.

828
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,355
Oh!

829
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,995
No, of course, I'm sorry. I just...

830
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,951
I thought...

831
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,551
We should bury him.

832
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,518
No, I don't think we should.

833
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,030
Foxes dig up dead animals and eat them.

834
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,831
What should we do, then?

835
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,919
Well, there's this thing the Vikings used to do.

836
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,351
Jude would like to meet you.

837
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,518
- Who's Jude?
- My mum.

838
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,357
Since when have you called her Jude?

839
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,317
Since she might die in two weeks.

840
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,588
Right.

841
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,111
So, do you wanna come?

842
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,190
The Bevans had Christmas dinner early
in case it was the last one they had.

843
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,870
I hoped it wouldn't be,
cos the turkey was quite dry

844
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,480
and the spouts had turned mushy
and out of focus.

845
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,873
This is crackin', love.

846
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,638
Yeah, it's great. Thank you, Mrs Bevan.

847
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,113
This is my last warning.

848
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,149
It's Jude.

849
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,510
So, I hear from my little girl
that you've stolen her heart.

850
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,310
Dad...

851
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,999
Let me tell you,
if you're lucky enough to find an angel,

852
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,829
hold onto her with everything you've got.

853
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,271
Oh, these fucking lights!

854
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,191
Cheap shit.

855
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,631
Oh, come on.

856
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,235
You're acting like I'm dead already.

857
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,033
Come on.

858
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,355
It'd take more than
some silly tumour to kill me.

859
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,960
- It might not.
- Oh, come on, now. Don't be daft.

860
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,991
- Sorry.
- All right.

861
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,471
Oh, it's all right, darling. Ssh.

862
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,194
- Come here.
- Sorry, love.

863
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,914
Are you all right? Come on.

864
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,632
- Come on.
- Sorry, sorry.

865
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,351
Sorry.

866
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,435
- All right?
- Yeah.

867
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,516
I'm fine. I'm fine. Give us a cudge.

868
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,638
Listen... Thank you.

869
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,752
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

870
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,076
Thank you for looking after Jordana,
for walking through the fire with her.

871
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,792
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- No.

872
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,070
- No, we both do.
- He's a good boy, isn't he?

873
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,678
Part of the family now. Deal?

874
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,073
- Deal?
- Deal.

875
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,473
Family, deal.

876
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,748
Deal, yes?

877
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,756
There we fucking go.

878
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,073
Maybe you should come to the hospital
this Friday.

879
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,238
Mum will have had her operation by then
and we can visit.

880
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,956
- If you felt like it.
- Er, Friday.

881
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,998
I've got to do some Christmas shopping.

882
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,919
- What?
- I always leave it too late.

883
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,269
- I want to get you something good.
- Mother might die.

884
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,435
- I know.
- Do you care,

885
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,516
- or couldn't you give a fuck?
- I do, clearly.

886
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,073
I'll come. When is it?

887
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,792
Friday.

888
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,319
Great, yeah.

889
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,514
Yeah, Friday's good for me, actually.
Yeah, I can do that. Excellent.

890
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,676
Your skin's better. You're allergic to the dog.

891
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,598
I'm eating better.

892
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,519
Following Mum's special diet.

893
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,516
Is that because of the...

894
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,471
We eat lots of ginger now.

895
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,431
So, Friday.

896
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,398
The visiting hours are six till eight.

897
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,909
Got it. Six till eight.

898
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,678
I'll meet you there.

899
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,597
OK.

900
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,108
I'm sorry I'm like this.

901
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,720
- I dunno. I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

902
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,719
- Don't think you have to wait. It's cold.
- No, it's fine. I'll wait.

903
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,432
I've got you these matches.

904
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,391
Your favourite.

905
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,038
I noticed the way you light a match.

906
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,914
The flame is the same shape
as a falling tear.

907
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,471
I knew then it was too late to save her.

908
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,316
She'd gone gooey in the middle.

909
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,797
From now on she'll buy little gifts
for her favourite teachers

910
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:50,037
and she'll admire the scenery
and she'll buy soup for homeless people.

911
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,549
And she'll never burn my leg here again.

912
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,995
- Maybe I will go. It's pretty cold.
- Yeah.

913
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,396
OK.

914
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,191
Good night.

915
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,156
TV: When I discovered
I could see these colours in people,

916
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,717
it took a long time because I was
in such a state of anxiety.

917
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,151
It was when I start.ed to be comfort.able with it
and stopped trying to resist it,

918
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,111
it start.ed to nourish me.

919
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,594
And I could relax around it and be in it.

920
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,110
Then I start.ed to make
more of an understanding of it.

921
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,109
Well, it's um...

922
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,471
It's interesting.

923
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,234
He's really working that third eye, isn't he?

924
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,315
It's just a metaphor, Lloyd.

925
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,796
Oh, no, no, no. I mean, it's good, yes.

926
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,795
I like the whole colour coding thing.

927
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,277
Well, I'd like to go again.

928
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,231
I'd like you to be there, so...

929
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,229
- You want us to go?
- Yes, I do.

930
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,393
Right.

931
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,478
Do I have to bring shorts?

932
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,394
- It's on this Friday, so...
- Right, OK, yeah.

933
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,951
What, are you coming or...

934
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,677
Well, I'm intrigued, yeah.

935
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,315
- For sure.
- This Friday. This Friday.

936
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,475
- This Friday?
- Mm-hm.

937
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,317
OK, yep, yep.

938
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,190
- Thank you.
- Mm.

939
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,558
Don't let me down. OK?

940
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,231
The most fantastical way
people experience the Graham T Purvis system

941
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,599
is to come to the seminar.

942
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,551
Oliver, what are you doing?

943
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,115
..have been mind-blowing.
I've seen lives change.

944
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,471
It's just incredible.

945
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:03,511
I wish on a global scale
that people could get the message.

946
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,679
Wouldn't it be just wonderful?

947
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,238
Friday...

948
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,750
I'll be OK. I'll be...

949
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,553
I'll be fine. I'll be all right.

950
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,511
Yeah, I'll be OK.

951
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,312
Yeah.

952
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,471
(Low breathing via a ventilator)

953
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,871
(Volume of breathing increases)

954
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,391
You should go in.

955
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:40,991
(Birdsong)

956
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,231
(Wind whistles)

957
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,751
Dad, aren't you going to Graham's thing?

958
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,839
- Hm?
- Graham's thing. It's Friday.

959
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,711
I thought you were going out.

960
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,910
Yeah, I'm meant to be at the hospital.

961
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,633
Well, you should get along then, I suppose.

962
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,796
Yeah. Yeah, I will. Yeah, I should go.

963
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,191
Right, I'm off out.

964
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,870
I'll see you, then.

965
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,639
Bye.

966
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,110
Dad, who would you save first in a house fire,

967
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,039
given the hypothetical situation

968
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,355
that both Mum and l
were equally difficult to save?

969
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,628
I'd save your mother first,

970
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,195
so we had a better chance
of working together to save you.

971
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,750
Do you often feel like this?

972
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,428
Like what?

973
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,438
- Tired?
- Down in the dumps.

974
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,035
Quite often.

975
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,391
How long for?

976
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,389
Since I was about your age, I suppose.

977
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,751
What does it feel like?

978
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,871
Like being underwater.

979
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,438
Is that why you became a marine biologist?

980
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,757
Maybe, yeah.

981
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,711
Have you always liked fish?

982
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,391
I suppose so.

983
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,550
I just sort of drifted into it, really.
No pun intended.

984
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,911
And does Mum mind?

985
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,677
I think she'd rather I earnt more money.

986
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,031
No, you being underwater.

987
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,069
Oh.

988
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,712
Yeah, no.

989
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,035
I'm sure she'd rather I wasn't.

990
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,594
It's not very pleasant.

991
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,116
The ocean is six miles deep, isn't it?

992
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,431
Well remembered. Yeah.

993
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,032
(Phone rings)

994
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,232
Could be Mum.

995
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,191
Or Jordana.

996
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,196
(Phone continues ringing)

997
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,711
(Front door shuts)

998
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,631
(Phone rings)

999
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:33,991
(Ringing tone)

1000
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,753
I haven't spoken to Jordana about her mother
because there's only two possible outcomes.

1001
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,918
Either the operation was a success,

1002
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,872
in which case she'll be too relieved
to be angry with me for long,

1003
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,114
or her mother was dead,

1004
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,958
in which case she needs privacy
and time to grieve.

1005
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,678
During this brief hiatus,
I can help save my parents' marriage

1006
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,317
and then resume my duties
as the best boyfriend in the world.

1007
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,151
Oliver.

1008
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,635
Yes?

1009
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,274
- What's this?
- I don't know.

1010
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:32,594
- What is this?
- A letter.

1011
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,517
- I don't know what's in it.
- I think you do.

1012
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,471
Why did you write this, Oliver?

1013
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,319
This isn't funny.

1014
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,149
If I did write it, and I'm not as yet
admitting that I did,

1015
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,395
it'd be because I spoke to Dad.
This is what he wants.

1016
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,034
- You spoke to Dad?
- He knows he's been imperfect.

1017
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,718
What did you talk about, Oliver?

1018
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,671
Listen,

1019
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,599
he still finds you attractive.

1020
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,951
He still wants to make love to you.

1021
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,468
Are you making this up?

1022
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,071
Me and Dad have discussed it.
We both want to make this marriage work.

1023
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,712
Are you with us?

1024
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,311
(Door shuts)

1025
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,311
(Front door slams)

1026
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,993
(Car engine starts)

1027
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,273
JlLL: Going to the beach with Graham.
I will not be back tonight.

1028
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,397
OLlVER: On New Year's Eve,
everyone from town goes to the beach.

1029
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,434
Chip said, if a girl won't get off with you
on New Year's Eve,

1030
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,959
you may as well cut it off.

1031
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,389
I'm start.ing to think that we may grow apart..

1032
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,358
I don't want a mystic ninja as a stepdad.

1033
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,916
I don't want to be from a broken home
like Chip's,

1034
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,397
wearing tracksuit tops instead of coats
and taking gateway drugs in shopping malls.

1035
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,112
I want my family back.

1036
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,071
I don't want anything to change.

1037
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,909
(Fireworks explode)

1038
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,510
The celebrations are really kicking in, right?

1039
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,879
Yeah.

1040
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,831
It distresses tiny animals.

1041
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,159
- You can relax, right?
- Mm.

1042
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,068
- There's some lovely massage oils.
- Great. OK.

1043
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,519
In you get.

1044
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,471
All right.

1045
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,751
(Fireworks explode)

1046
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,871
(Whistles from crowd on beach)

1047
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,071
(Mutters)

1048
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,916
I have no idea what I'm hoping to achieve
by breaking into Graham's house.

1049
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:41,430
I just want to give him
the idea that I'm deranged

1050
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,516
and therefore capable of anything.

1051
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,552
This will probably involve me urinating
or something.

1052
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,556
I need a fucking drink.

1053
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,148
(Whispers)

1054
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,352
I'm doing it. Just do it.

1055
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,072
Just do it...

1056
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,235
Just do it.

1057
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:15,555
OK.

1058
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,399
Feel my piss.

1059
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,631
Oh, come on.

1060
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:21,991
Come on.

1061
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,070
Oh, for fuck...

1062
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,431
Fuck.

1063
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:28,834
It's fine.

1064
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,191
Come on. Just...

1065
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,111
(Mutters)

1066
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,434
Fucking piss on your face, you fucking freak.

1067
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,431
For fuck's sake, just come on. Loosen up.

1068
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,551
Oh, here we go.

1069
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,753
(Trickle)

1070
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,634
OK, that'll do it.

1071
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,673
Jesus Christ.

1072
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,999
Fuck.

1073
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:11,871
(Coughs)

1074
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:15,676
(Retches)

1075
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,552
(Coughs)

1076
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,951
Kim-Lin?

1077
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,911
Is that you?

1078
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,951
Do you still have a key?

1079
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,111
That's very naughty.

1080
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,711
Oh, this is fun, isn't it?

1081
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,391
What kind of protest's this, then, eh?

1082
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,273
Huh?

1083
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:59,076
How much more of this bizarre behaviour
do I have to endure?

1084
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,032
(Exhales) Nearly went red there.

1085
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,630
Come on, up you get, sweetheart.

1086
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,591
I'm just try...

1087
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,237
My name is not Kim-Lin.

1088
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,194
My name is Oliver Tate.

1089
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,151
(Doorbell rings)

1090
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,989
Hello.

1091
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,391
Hello.

1092
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,471
Hello!

1093
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,831
LLOYD: Knock, knock.

1094
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,118
How are you feeling?

1095
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,471
I saw Mum with Graham at the beach.

1096
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,431
Mm. Mum told me everything.

1097
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,029
Did she say she went into the van
with his face on it?

1098
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:00,356
Yes.

1099
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,789
Did she say what happened in the van
with his face on it?

1100
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,909
Yes.

1101
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,598
Aren't you angry?

1102
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,551
Worse things have happened at sea, Ol.

1103
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,154
- What did happen?
- That's between your mother and l.

1104
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,191
JlLL: Lloyd, I think it best we be honest.

1105
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,593
Sweet pea,

1106
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,551
I gave Graham a handjob.

1107
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,760
Is there anything you'd like to say about that?

1108
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,431
- Lloyd, do you want to add anything?
- No.

1109
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:27,192
OK. Well, I was drunk
and I was trying to relax Graham.

1110
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,708
- It was a silly thing to do.
- Mm.

1111
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,074
Thank you.

1112
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,431
Your father and I have discussed it

1113
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,839
and if it's OK with everyone,
that's the last we'll say about it.

1114
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,191
OK? Thank you.

1115
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,909
Is there anything
you'd like to talk about now, huh?

1116
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,153
Me and Jordana
are having relationship problems.

1117
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,989
- Oh.
- It's difficult.

1118
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,429
I suppose it won't matter when I'm 38 but...

1119
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,799
I'm upset about it.

1120
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,558
You should be more angry with her.

1121
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,511
Why would I be angry with Jordana?

1122
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,354
Oh, you mean me.

1123
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,392
Yes. No, no. Well, you know, I am.

1124
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,351
Yeah, I'm upset.

1125
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,110
We should go back to sleep, though.

1126
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,073
Yeah.

1127
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:13,669
We're not going to punish you now
but we're going to talk about what you've done.

1128
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:15,039
What about what you've done?

1129
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,513
OK, don't push it, Ol.

1130
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,757
Well, we'll talk about that too
but you should go back to sleep now, OK?

1131
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,109
- OK.
- Mm?

1132
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,711
Right.

1133
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,477
JORDANA: Dear Oliver, I tried to tell you

1134
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,276
but I figure you'll only probably believe me
if it's in writing. It's over.

1135
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,311
I enclose my lighter as a parting gift for you.

1136
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,715
Also, I think you should know,
I've found someone else.

1137
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,990
When we're in school together,
try not to look upset.

1138
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,076
I know you're a good actor.

1139
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:16,193
PS: You were right about
my being allergic to dogs. I got tested.

1140
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,993
Oh, and in case you're interested,
my mum's fine now.

1141
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,190
Sorry if it made you feel awkward.

1142
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,394
# ALEX TURNER:
It's Hard To Get Around The Wind

1143
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,996
# It's like you're trying to get to heaven
in a hurry

1144
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,352
# And the queue was shorter
than you thought it'd be

1145
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,713
# And the doorman says,
You need to get a wrist band

1146
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,430
# You got a lift between the pitfalls

1147
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:53,111
# But you're looking like you're low on energy

1148
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:58,473
# Did you get out and walk
to ensure you'd miss the quicksand?

1149
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,997
Could you tell her I called?

1150
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,557
# Looking for a new place to begin
- It's Oliver. Oliver Tate.

1151
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,991
Oh, yeah, she's got my number.

1152
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,035
# Feeling like it's hard to understand

1153
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:18,196
# But as long as you still keep peppering the pill

1154
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:23,515
# You'll find a way to spit it out again

1155
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:30,916
# And even when you know
the way it's gonna blow

1156
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:39,313
# It's hard to get around the wind

1157
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,671
None of this will matter when I'm 38.

1158
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,992
But it's been two months
since Jordana last spoke to me.

1159
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,190
Her new boyfriend has an incredibly long neck.

1160
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,314
Just thinking about giraffes makes me angry.

1161
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,717
I wish I could hand in this excuse note.

1162
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,354
"Dear Mr Davey,

1163
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,392
Please may Oliver be excused from class.
His tiny heart is broken.

1164
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,351
Yours sincerely, Lloyd Tate."

1165
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,235
# Stretching out the neck on your evening

1166
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,793
# Trying to even out some deficit

1167
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:14,519
# But it's sabre-toothed, multi-ball confusion

1168
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,875
# And you can shriek until you're hollow

1169
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,312
# Or whisper it the other way

1170
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:27,434
# Trying to save the youth
without putting your shoes on

1171
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,559
# Looking for a new place to begin

1172
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,989
- Is he all right?
- He's fine. Just leave him.

1173
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:47,273
# As long as you still keep peppering the pill

1174
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:52,635
# You'll find a way to spit it out again

1175
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:59,917
# And even when you know
the way it's gonna blow

1176
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:05,433
# It's hard

1177
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:10,431
# To get around the wind

1178
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,634
In my other recurring dream,
I mentally rehearse the end scene.

1179
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,038
The one where it's getting dark
and I mistake a girl for Jordana.

1180
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,277
A girl with the exact same frame
and the exact same hair.

1181
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:24,392
And when she turns around,
I see her face is nothing like Jordana's.

1182
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,590
And she asks, "Do I know you? "

1183
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,392
And I look traumatised and say...

1184
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,112
No.

1185
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,878
You don't know me.

1186
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,876
You don't know me at all.

1187
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,468
I think this will matter when I'm older,
when I'm 38.

1188
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,239
Don't you knock any more?

1189
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,269
Sorry, Oliver. What?

1190
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,675
Jordana... I think it will matter when I'm older.

1191
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,153
Yeah, course it will.

1192
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,156
OK, well... Good night.

1193
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:53,956
# And I can hear you through my window

1194
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,517
# But I'm never quite sure who is who

1195
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:02,839
# But they want the world on a dessert spoon

1196
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,752
# It always sounds like they're fighting

1197
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,795
# Or as if that's what they're about to do

1198
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,831
# It might not hurt now

1199
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,111
# But it's gonna hurt soon

1200
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,751
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1201
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,840
You've got to be shitting me.

1202
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:33,996
Pritchard.

1203
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:36,395
Pritchard, take a look at this.
It's as funny as fuck.

1204
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,635
MR DUNTHORNE: All right, whose note is that?

1205
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,879
It's mine.

1206
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,712
Thank you, Oliver, for your refreshing honesty.

1207
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:52,276
But you know the rules.
Up you come, read it out.

1208
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,431
(Clears throat)

1209
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,878
It was just a joke?

1210
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,469
Yeah.

1211
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,398
OK, well, as I say,
if it was just a joke then that's fine.

1212
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,352
But if ever you have serious feelings

1213
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,631
of, you know, difficulty

1214
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,999
or sadness

1215
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:53,350
or any negative feelings that you want
to talk about, feel free to come and...

1216
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,628
I know, I know, yeah.

1217
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,033
I can talk to you about that.

1218
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,672
OK. I don't want to embarrass you

1219
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:01,679
but I just wanted you to know that
I'm open to talking whenever you want.

1220
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,914
Yeah. OK.

1221
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:03,870
Cool.

1222
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,353
Good.

1223
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,789
Nice one, Ol. Nice one, you fuck-muppet.

1224
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,798
Why write stuff like that?
Perhaps people are right and you are gay.

1225
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,877
"Jordana, I love you. I want to
have your babies, get married."

1226
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:15,035
What the fuck?

1227
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,675
- Fuck you, Chips.
- What the fuck are you up to, you fool?

1228
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,755
What?

1229
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,918
- You're a loser.
- Go and see the girl

1230
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,791
- who doesn't like you.
- I'll be back.

1231
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,398
I'll hit you in the face.

1232
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,078
Can I have a word, please, in private,
without him?

1233
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,874
I'm fine here.

1234
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,312
Sorry I didn't come to the hospital.

1235
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,478
I thought my parents were going to split up

1236
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,670
and I didn't want to look weak
or things to change.

1237
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,995
(Whispers)
My mum gave a hand-job to a mystic.

1238
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,791
Look, I was frightened.

1239
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,032
I'm full of regret.

1240
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,988
This is the moment where you leave him
and come with me.

1241
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,958
Is it?

1242
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,277
Yeah.

1243
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,231
Are you coming?

1244
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,511
No.

1245
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,279
(Chips laughs)

1246
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,391
(Seagulls cry)

1247
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,198
I don't know if I've come of age
but I'm certainly older now.

1248
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:43,189
I feel shrunken, as if there's
a tiny ancient Oliver Tate inside me

1249
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:45,993
operating the levers of
a life-size Oliver-shaped shell.

1250
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,235
A shell on which a decrepit picture show

1251
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,191
replays the same handful of images.

1252
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:10,113
Every night I come to the same place
and wait till the sky catches up with my mood.

1253
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,273
The pattern is set.

1254
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,951
This is, no doubt, the end.

1255
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:33,835
Jordana!

1256
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,078
Jordana!

1257
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:49,071
It is you.

1258
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,636
I didn't think it'd be you. I...

1259
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:55,511
I thought it'd be like a film
where the girl turns round and it's not the...

1260
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,552
You've got a new dog. You're allergic.

1261
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,158
- Oliver.
- Where's your boyfriend?

1262
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,553
He's not my boyfriend.

1263
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,319
Your skin's looking bad, terrible.
It's probably the dog.

1264
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:05,191
I don't care about my fucking skin.

1265
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,312
- Why on earth did you get a new dog?
- Because I like dogs, OK?

1266
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,998
Why are you such a total dick?

1267
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:11,951
I don't know.

1268
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,074
I was crying earlier. My eyes are probably red.

1269
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:16,555
They look fine.

1270
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,750
No, well, maybe they don't go red when I cry.

1271
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,711
It happens to some.

1272
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,672
You were horrible to me.

1273
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,149
I know. I made a mistake.

1274
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,034
I made a mistake.
What do you want me to say?

1275
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,152
- Ask me how deep the ocean is.
- Shut up.

1276
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,715
Go on, just ask me.

1277
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,239
- Why?
- Because I know the answer.

1278
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,032
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah. I do.

1279
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:44,559
- How deep?
- I'm not going to say.

1280
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,511
I'm broken-hearted.

1281
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,231
- The ocean is six miles deep.
- Good.
