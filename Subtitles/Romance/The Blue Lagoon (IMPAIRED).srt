1
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,176
Richard, don't go out too far.

2
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,231
Em's a fraidy cat!

3
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:58,113
Richard! Emmeline!

4
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:01,972
Come back here this minute.

5
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,663
And be careful.

6
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:07,212
What's gotten into you, Richard?

7
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:10,318
Bad enough to endanger yourself,
but to encourage Emmeline...

8
00:03:10,534 --> 00:03:12,047
I'm sorry, Father.

9
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:14,352
I know you want to have fun.

10
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:19,157
All I'm trying to do is get us all
to San Francisco in one piece.

11
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:22,098
Will Mommy be coming to San Fr'isco?

12
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:24,476
I don't believe so, Richard.

13
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:26,941
I told you. Once they go to heaven...

14
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:30,092
...they don't come back.
Isn't that right, Uncle Arthur?

15
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:32,420
My mommy and daddy haven't come back.

16
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,988
Because God wants them to stay...

17
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:37,415
...and do his work and wait for the day...

18
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:40,675
...when you will take
the long voyage to see them.

19
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:42,570
When will that be?

20
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:44,781
When you've lived a full life...

21
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:47,094
...and experienced all that it has to offer.

22
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,395
Look!

23
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:55,155
Father, what are they called?

24
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,319
Sharks.

25
00:03:56,456 --> 00:04:00,495
I wish I had a hook. I'd pull 'em aboard
and the cook would fry 'em for dinner.

26
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:32,312
Captain, do you know
there's a fog bank coming in?

27
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,703
I'm aware of that fact, sir.

28
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,908
I heard one of the men say
those storms rounding the cape...

29
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:40,035
...pushed us far west of our course.

30
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:43,963
That's right, sir.
Last night's celestial puts us about here.

31
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:56,070
Richard, what are you looking at?

32
00:05:00,272 --> 00:05:02,547
They don't have any clothes on.

33
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:10,009
What the hell are you two doing here?
I'll teach you, bucko!

34
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:12,140
Come here.

35
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:15,465
Don't you dare hurt him.

36
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,836
You want a hiding, too, do you?

37
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:21,194
- Fire!
- Fire?

38
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,603
Did somebody say "fire"?

39
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,940
Man the pumps.

40
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:32,620
- Button.
- Yes, sir?

41
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:36,120
Take the children and Mr. Lestrange
and row them away from the ship.

42
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:37,101
Come on.

43
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:39,498
Mr. Lestrange.

44
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:42,925
There's blasting powder in that hold.
I saw them load it.

45
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:48,188
Keep moving!

46
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:54,380
Come on, will you?

47
00:05:58,623 --> 00:05:59,419
Come on, you.

48
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,371
Uncle Arthur!

49
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:02,976
Richard! Emmeline!

50
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,001
- This way, Lestrange.
- The children!

51
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:07,969
They've already taken their leave.
Follow me, sir.

52
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,050
No, there is no more room.

53
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,574
Lower away!

54
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:18,407
Abandon ship!

55
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,046
Don't explode yet!

56
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:32,976
Further.

57
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:35,767
What's happening? I can't see.

58
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:39,427
- What was that?
- The ship. Cover your faces.

59
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:43,520
Richard!

60
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:45,986
Emmeline!

61
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,230
Uncle Arthur!

62
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,828
There they are!

63
00:06:49,968 --> 00:06:51,117
Where?

64
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:52,496
Captain, over here.

65
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:53,672
Richard!

66
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:55,935
Hello.

67
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,294
Father!

68
00:06:58,934 --> 00:07:01,004
Don't go shouting both at once.

69
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,758
I won't know which way to steer.

70
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:06,955
Longboat, ahoy! Where are you?

71
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:15,346
Hello!

72
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,567
Father!

73
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,581
Gone.

74
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:39,116
Lord, help us.

75
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:21,879
Where is Father?

76
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,379
What is your name?

77
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:29,038
Paddy Button. Now, belay your questions.
Can't you see I'm busy?

78
00:08:30,653 --> 00:08:32,689
Damn it. No food or water.

79
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:38,120
That's Chopin. I can play it on the piano.

80
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:46,094
Mr. Button, can I ask you a question?

81
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:47,533
Yes.

82
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,309
Are you a pirate?

83
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,038
I'm thirsty.

84
00:08:59,475 --> 00:09:00,703
Me, too.

85
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:03,210
Listen...

86
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:06,652
...you'll hear it hiss
when it touches the water.

87
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:10,965
- You hear it?
- I think so.

88
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:12,985
I don't hear anything.

89
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:16,970
Listen harder.
It must be fairly boilin' by now.

90
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:19,473
There. Do you hear it?

91
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:22,215
I hear it. Don't you hear it now, Em?

92
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:24,246
I think so.

93
00:09:25,043 --> 00:09:26,362
Yes, I hear it.

94
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:00,845
I smell flowers.

95
00:10:02,498 --> 00:10:04,011
Flowers?

96
00:10:11,049 --> 00:10:13,404
Mr. Button! Richard! Look!

97
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,749
It's land!

98
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:20,493
Land ho!

99
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:23,884
We're saved.
I would never have believed it.

100
00:11:42,976 --> 00:11:44,170
Where are we?

101
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:49,988
Nirvana, that's where we are. No more
"yes, sir," "no, sir," for Paddy Button.

102
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,147
No more breaking my back
over a stinkin' stove.

103
00:11:56,156 --> 00:11:58,112
Will Father be coming to fetch us?

104
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,683
Come on, let's look around.

105
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:26,575
Listen.

106
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,509
Come on.

107
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,099
I knew it.

108
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,312
It's lovely.

109
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,225
Water.

110
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,747
Ho, down there! Look out below!

111
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:30,709
Mr. Button, there's a barrel over here...

112
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,515
...with funny stuff in it
that smells like the Captain's breath.

113
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:36,888
The Captain's breath?

114
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:43,782
It's rum.

115
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,528
Sweet Jesus.

116
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:53,140
Look what a funny thing I found.
It's got holes in it.

117
00:13:53,735 --> 00:13:56,454
Give me that. Where did you get it?

118
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:02,601
- What was it?
- We'd better get out of here.

119
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:04,378
There's a bunch of them up there.

120
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:06,654
Come on, let's get out of here.

121
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,553
Hurry it up, will you?

122
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:21,332
I don't see Father's boat.

123
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:26,443
No, not yet. Maybe he'll be along later.

124
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:29,506
Maybe not.

125
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:36,692
Take them things out of your mouth!

126
00:14:36,864 --> 00:14:39,583
Open your mouth!
Take them out of your mouth!

127
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:41,580
Spit them out! Go on!

128
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:46,797
Don't cry. I ain't mad at you.

129
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:50,802
If you eat them berries, you'll go to sleep.
You'll never wake up again.

130
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:53,922
They're never-wake-up berries, you see?

131
00:14:57,551 --> 00:15:00,304
Just leave them berries alone. Come on.

132
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:06,590
We had a cat once
that went to sleep and never woke up.

133
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:10,076
Uncle Arthur said she was dead and buried.

134
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:13,788
Mr. Button, do you think she ate
some of those berries?

135
00:15:14,276 --> 00:15:15,425
Maybe.

136
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,528
What does it really mean, Paddy,
"dead and buried"?

137
00:15:20,408 --> 00:15:23,718
It means that they put you in the ground
and they cover you up.

138
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:26,626
And you're dead and buried, do you see?

139
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:29,800
Like Mrs. Jones' baby. Remember, Em?

140
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:33,171
The doctor dug it out of the cabbage patch.

141
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:34,661
The cabbage patch?

142
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:38,267
That's right.
But he took it back and planted it again.

143
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:41,262
So it could grow and turn into an angel.

144
00:15:41,596 --> 00:15:44,429
I got a trowel
and dug our cabbage patch all up.

145
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:47,519
But there weren't any babies or any angels.

146
00:15:48,478 --> 00:15:49,831
Only worms.

147
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:59,675
What's in them pictures, Richard?

148
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:03,300
It's a story about these funny people
who get married.

149
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:05,814
There is a saying under each one.

150
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,801
Give us a look.

151
00:16:14,796 --> 00:16:15,911
Yeah.

152
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,550
Were you ever married, Paddy?

153
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,073
Seven times.

154
00:16:23,222 --> 00:16:27,454
Kids in every port from Callao to Macao.
Seventeen at the last count.

155
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,669
Never set eyes on a single of them.

156
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:32,334
Slanted-eyed little devils...

157
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:36,235
...black little devils,
even a couple of pink ones like you.

158
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:39,283
And all with my eyes.

159
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:44,778
Paddy, what's "subjugation"?

160
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:48,172
Something I've been trying to avoid
all my life.

161
00:16:51,668 --> 00:16:54,136
Come back here. This ain't gonna hurt you.

162
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:57,624
We don't want to go swimming!
We don't have our bathing costumes!

163
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:59,593
To hell with your bathing costumes!

164
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,149
You don't wear them
when you have a bath, do you?

165
00:17:02,346 --> 00:17:04,655
This isn't a bathtub. This is the ocean!

166
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:21,326
Ready, go. That's it.

167
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:28,452
Whenever you see a ship,
you run down quick...

168
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:31,698
...and you light the signal fire.
Do you hear me?

169
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:37,473
There's the rabbit hole...

170
00:17:39,676 --> 00:17:43,305
There's a fox, see. Pull it tight.
There's a knot. Do it.

171
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:58,104
Run your finger up like that.
You shove that around under there.

172
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:11,765
There you are. Put it there, shipmate.

173
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,679
Where'd you find that?

174
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:24,001
I didn't find it.
I made it from the knots you taught me.

175
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:26,337
You made it? Well...

176
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,431
...pity it's not a bit bigger.

177
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:31,160
Let's go swimming.

178
00:18:31,312 --> 00:18:32,427
Yeah.

179
00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:59,803
Come back here and put your clothes on!

180
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,689
I don't want to wear my old britches.

181
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:08,653
It ain't proper to be
running around naked all the time.

182
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,839
Alone at last.

183
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:50,364
Richard, Emmeline,
I want you both to promise me something.

184
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:54,528
I want you to promise me
that you will never, ever go over...

185
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,820
...to the other side of the island.

186
00:20:57,003 --> 00:20:58,356
Why, Paddy?

187
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:02,433
Why? Because I tell you, that's why!

188
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:05,439
There's nasty things go on over there, see?

189
00:21:05,845 --> 00:21:07,915
Vile, evil, sinister things.

190
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:09,792
Like what?

191
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,810
Yes, Mr. Button, like what?

192
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:14,935
Well, for a start,
that's where the bogeyman lives.

193
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:16,499
The bogeyman?

194
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:19,685
That's right. And you know what happens
when the bogeyman...

195
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:22,780
...gets his hands on little people
like yourselves?

196
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,294
Why, he just eats them.

197
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,601
He pops them into his mouth like candy...

198
00:21:27,785 --> 00:21:31,414
...and he chews them up
and he swallows them, bones and all.

199
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:38,412
Do you know what "law" is?

200
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:42,955
Good. From now on, that's the law, see?

201
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:46,785
No one goes over to the other side.

202
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:53,621
You look funny.

203
00:21:54,353 --> 00:21:57,186
Children, where are you?

204
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,004
Look at me.

205
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:04,507
Look at me.

206
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,152
You're silly
when you drink out of that barrel.

207
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,525
This is a serious dance.

208
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,039
Sing the one
about the Hoochie Coochie girls.

209
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,303
Come on. Are you ready?

210
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:09,970
Where's Paddy?

211
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:26,952
He's gone.

212
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:29,952
There he is.

213
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,650
He must have swum over there
and gone to sleep. Come on.

214
00:24:42,693 --> 00:24:44,570
What are you doing that for?

215
00:24:44,945 --> 00:24:49,097
I'm going to put it on Mr. Button's head,
so when you say "boo" into his ear...

216
00:24:49,616 --> 00:24:51,766
...he'll jump up with it on.

217
00:25:16,852 --> 00:25:18,808
Paddy, wake up, it's us.

218
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:23,560
Wake up!

219
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:08,668
Don't worry, Em, we'll be all right.

220
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:12,295
Take me away from this place, Richard.

221
00:26:53,618 --> 00:26:54,767
Look!

222
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:08,191
This looks like a good place
to stay for awhile.

223
00:30:28,881 --> 00:30:31,315
Wake up. It's Christmas morning.

224
00:30:31,718 --> 00:30:32,753
Christmas?

225
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:36,161
Yesterday, I counted 52 big marks
on the tree and last night he came.

226
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:37,787
What are you talking about?

227
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:41,810
Santa Claus. I saw all his reindeer
right there on the beach.

228
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:43,972
Let's see if he brought us anything.

229
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:45,421
Come on, Em, hurry.

230
00:30:50,945 --> 00:30:53,459
That's where the reindeer were, see?

231
00:30:55,158 --> 00:30:56,955
Look at our stockings.

232
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,991
And there's something in them!

233
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:15,929
Look, just what I always wanted.

234
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:17,366
What are they?

235
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,626
What do they look like? They're marbles.

236
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,800
See, these are your Jaspers
and these are your Peewees.

237
00:31:26,482 --> 00:31:27,995
You did it all.

238
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:29,279
But...

239
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:37,327
Fooled ya, didn't I?

240
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:41,523
You!

241
00:31:51,757 --> 00:31:53,315
Why are we always fighting so much?

242
00:31:55,386 --> 00:31:56,580
I don't know.

243
00:31:57,389 --> 00:32:00,665
That should be our New Year's revolution:
to stop fighting so much.

244
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:03,963
- I'll try, but...
- But, what?

245
00:32:05,606 --> 00:32:08,916
I don't know what's wrong with me
when I say the things I say.

246
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:11,998
I just keep on having
all these strange thoughts.

247
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,872
What kind of thoughts?

248
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:18,118
Just thoughts.
Funny thoughts about you and me.

249
00:32:20,913 --> 00:32:22,028
Tell me.

250
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:23,517
I couldn't.

251
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:26,794
They're just thoughts.
They don't mean anything.

252
00:32:27,878 --> 00:32:29,357
Where did you find these?

253
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:31,582
I found them in those little shells.

254
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:34,684
They're beautiful. Thank you.

255
00:32:47,023 --> 00:32:50,015
"O come, all ye faithful"

256
00:32:53,321 --> 00:32:56,870
"O little town of Bethlehem"

257
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:03,802
"Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh

258
00:33:04,207 --> 00:33:05,606
"All the"

259
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:11,472
Help!

260
00:34:23,037 --> 00:34:24,026
What's wrong?

261
00:34:27,877 --> 00:34:28,946
You're bleeding.

262
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,199
Don't! I'm all right.

263
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:33,699
But you're bleeding.

264
00:34:34,132 --> 00:34:35,770
Go away! Don't look at me.

265
00:34:38,972 --> 00:34:40,200
Go away!

266
00:35:08,626 --> 00:35:10,139
What was it, Em?

267
00:35:10,503 --> 00:35:13,336
- Why were you bleeding like that?
- I don't know.

268
00:35:13,632 --> 00:35:14,747
Liar!

269
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:16,965
It's true, I don't know.

270
00:35:20,973 --> 00:35:24,363
People don't bleed like that
unless they've cut themselves.

271
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:27,863
Maybe you're hurt real bad
and you just don't know it.

272
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:30,536
- Let me look.
- No! I don't want you to look.

273
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:33,247
- But, why?
- Just because.

274
00:35:33,985 --> 00:35:35,543
That is not fair.

275
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:38,976
I don't keep any secrets from you.
I tell you everything.

276
00:35:39,492 --> 00:35:40,845
Everything.

277
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,582
What are you looking at?

278
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:28,704
Your muscles.

279
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:30,486
What about them?

280
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:36,068
You're really acting silly lately.
Always saying dumb things like that.

281
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:37,934
Always looking at me funny.

282
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:40,815
You're not coming down with something,
are you?

283
00:36:42,848 --> 00:36:44,566
Well, don't give it to me.

284
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:04,921
Tell me again.

285
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,981
- Where are your mother and father?
- In heaven.

286
00:38:08,477 --> 00:38:10,069
But where's heaven?

287
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:12,247
You know, up there.

288
00:38:12,982 --> 00:38:16,099
- Your father might be there, too.
- No, he's not.

289
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:19,037
He's coming on a ship someday
to take us home.

290
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,054
Do you hear it?

291
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:26,739
No.

292
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:28,627
Do you ever hear it?

293
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,701
Sometimes I think I do.

294
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:32,884
I think Paddy was a liar.

295
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:36,821
He told us there was a pot of gold
at the end of every rainbow...

296
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,648
...and that was a lie.

297
00:38:39,135 --> 00:38:42,047
He told us if we dug far enough
we'd reach China.

298
00:38:42,596 --> 00:38:44,666
And Santa Claus never came.

299
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:53,616
Do you ever think about him?

300
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:57,850
I do.

301
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,998
I know you don't like to talk about it, but...

302
00:39:03,743 --> 00:39:06,780
...don't you ever wonder
what really happened?

303
00:39:09,624 --> 00:39:11,854
I don't want to know what happened.

304
00:39:14,963 --> 00:39:15,952
I do.

305
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:19,937
There are so many things
I don't understand.

306
00:39:20,135 --> 00:39:24,572
Why do fish stop swimming and lie on top
of the tide pools after it rains?

307
00:39:26,182 --> 00:39:28,616
Why do you hear the waves
inside the big shells?

308
00:39:28,852 --> 00:39:31,286
Why are all these funny hairs
growing on me?

309
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,714
I wish a big book with all the answers
to every question in the world...

310
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:41,904
...would drop out of the sky
and land in my hand right now.

311
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:45,790
- I'd read it till I knew everything.
- You can't know everything.

312
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,910
Only God knows everything.

313
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:50,400
God?

314
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:53,422
He can't find us
any better than Santa Claus.

315
00:40:26,243 --> 00:40:28,234
I wonder what fish think about?

316
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,939
What are you doing?

317
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,003
Trying to cheer you up. Come on, laugh.

318
00:40:39,924 --> 00:40:41,516
It's not going to work.

319
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:44,974
There it is again.

320
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:50,470
Do you think it's the bogeyman?

321
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,397
Maybe it's another person.

322
00:40:57,901 --> 00:40:58,651
No...

323
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:02,069
...or he would have come over
to meet us and say hello.

324
00:41:02,614 --> 00:41:04,252
That's the proper thing to do.

325
00:41:04,408 --> 00:41:07,241
What if he's not nice?
What if he wants to hurt us?

326
00:41:09,706 --> 00:41:11,105
Then I'll spear him.

327
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:35,827
Look! I'm the greatest fisherman
who ever lived.

328
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:38,719
I'm the greatest fisherman who ever lived.

329
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:41,700
While you scare them off,
I catch as many as I want to.

330
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:44,384
That's my fish dance!
It doesn't scare them off.

331
00:41:44,573 --> 00:41:47,485
It brings them up to the surface
where I can spear them.

332
00:41:47,702 --> 00:41:49,215
Who cares what you say?

333
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,089
It's not how many you catch.
It's how you do it.

334
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:11,294
Stop that!

335
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:15,249
Please play something else.

336
00:42:16,398 --> 00:42:19,470
Why must you do that
when you know it makes me angry?

337
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:37,352
"It doesn't scare them away.
It brings 'em to the top...

338
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:39,137
"...where I can spear them."

339
00:42:39,797 --> 00:42:40,946
I'll spear you.

340
00:42:59,526 --> 00:43:00,845
Here I am.

341
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:02,673
Come back here...

342
00:43:02,905 --> 00:43:05,863
...or I'll pull your britches down
and take a switch to you.

343
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,756
Don't you dare try to spank me. I mean it.

344
00:43:09,953 --> 00:43:12,751
I'll put never-wake-up berries in your food!
I mean it.

345
00:43:12,956 --> 00:43:15,311
Say, "Richard is the smartest person
on the island."

346
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:18,830
- Say it!
- Stop it, Richard. I'm getting angry.

347
00:43:19,256 --> 00:43:21,133
- Stop it! Now get off.
- Say it!

348
00:43:21,923 --> 00:43:24,232
Richard is the smartest person
on the island.

349
00:43:24,427 --> 00:43:26,577
- The fastest swimmer.
- The fastest swimmer.

350
00:43:26,763 --> 00:43:28,833
- The fastest runner.
- The fastest runner.

351
00:43:29,014 --> 00:43:32,051
- The best hut builder.
- You're the best everything. Now get off!

352
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:33,554
It's true.

353
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:37,322
Just you wait.
You'll never know when it'll happen.

354
00:43:37,524 --> 00:43:40,118
Just one little bite
and you'll never wake up again.

355
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,967
- What is it? What happened?
- I saw him.

356
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,576
- Who?
- The face Paddy thought was a bogeyman.

357
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:20,454
- You went to the other side?
- He's not the bogeyman.

358
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,285
I think he's God.

359
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,115
God?

360
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,463
He looks like Pastor Logan said
he looked like:

361
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,450
"You'd better be good or else."
And he was bleeding.

362
00:48:28,738 --> 00:48:30,615
- I don't believe you.
- Just like Jesus.

363
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,739
Don't go there again. It's the law.

364
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,264
What if he really is God?
Shouldn't we go and pray?

365
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:38,013
Or won't he be mad
and not let us go to heaven?

366
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,162
I don't want to talk about it.

367
00:49:59,623 --> 00:50:00,942
What is it?

368
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:02,921
I'm here.

369
00:50:07,965 --> 00:50:10,957
- You ate the "dead and berries"...
- No, I'm fine.

370
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:13,931
- You just had a bad dream.
- Don't ever leave me.

371
00:50:14,638 --> 00:50:17,198
Promise you won't.
Promise you'll always be with me.

372
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:18,594
I promise.

373
00:50:30,906 --> 00:50:32,180
Don't.

374
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,647
What are you doing?

375
00:51:37,182 --> 00:51:38,410
Go away!

376
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:05,093
Where are you going?

377
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:13,750
Wait. What's the matter?

378
00:52:33,073 --> 00:52:35,348
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

379
00:52:36,535 --> 00:52:38,093
Why won't you talk to me?

380
00:52:38,536 --> 00:52:40,925
Just leave me alone.

381
00:54:04,124 --> 00:54:05,842
A ship, Emmeline!

382
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:12,911
The signal fire, you didn't light it.
Why didn't you light it?

383
00:54:13,175 --> 00:54:17,168
You know how much I want to leave.
It's the most important thing to me.

384
00:54:17,471 --> 00:54:18,665
I know.

385
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,108
First you cry for help,
then you throw sticks at me.

386
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:23,584
A ship comes, a ship!

387
00:54:23,811 --> 00:54:28,248
The first ship we've seen
since we've been here and you let it go by.

388
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:30,796
Well, that's it. I've had it.

389
00:54:30,985 --> 00:54:33,419
I'm sick and tired
of waiting for you to get better.

390
00:54:33,654 --> 00:54:35,770
I'm going to San Fr'isco without you.

391
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:38,491
You'll never build a boat strong enough
to get to San Fr'isco.

392
00:55:38,763 --> 00:55:41,641
That's the fourth time you've tried
and they've all sunk.

393
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:42,760
Shut up!

394
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:44,211
Why don't you give up?

395
00:55:44,352 --> 00:55:46,912
You don't even know where San Fr'isco is.

396
00:55:49,691 --> 00:55:52,683
You're such a silly dodo.
We're never getting off this island.

397
00:55:52,903 --> 00:55:54,336
Thanks to you.

398
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:57,449
This is where we live.
This is our home, now and forever.

399
00:55:57,657 --> 00:55:58,692
No!

400
00:55:58,867 --> 00:56:01,097
I could never live here forever
with just you.

401
00:56:01,328 --> 00:56:03,888
I don't even like you.
You never used to laugh at me.

402
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:05,753
You never used to have secrets.

403
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:08,589
You're not so perfect either,
Mr. Richard Lestrange.

404
00:56:08,794 --> 00:56:10,386
I've seen you playing with it.

405
00:56:10,545 --> 00:56:12,934
And I'll tell your father if he ever gets here.

406
00:56:13,131 --> 00:56:14,769
You. I hate you.

407
00:56:16,844 --> 00:56:18,163
You almost hit me.

408
00:56:18,303 --> 00:56:21,056
- Take back what you said.
- I've seen it all.

409
00:56:21,265 --> 00:56:23,221
What happens after you do it a long time.

410
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:25,349
Shut up! That isn't fair, peeking.

411
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:27,077
- I don't peek on you.
- That's a lie.

412
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:29,061
You're always staring at my buppies.

413
00:56:29,232 --> 00:56:32,269
Only because they look so funny.
You know what you look like now?

414
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:34,601
You look like
one of those pictures Paddy had.

415
00:56:34,779 --> 00:56:36,497
One of his Hoochie Coochie girls.

416
00:56:36,656 --> 00:56:37,691
I do not!

417
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:43,212
Stop that, or I'll never talk to you again.

418
00:56:44,873 --> 00:56:46,864
See them jiggle, wiggle and shake.

419
00:56:49,377 --> 00:56:52,175
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.

420
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:56,321
I wish you were dead and buried.

421
00:57:04,602 --> 00:57:06,035
What are you doing?

422
00:57:12,193 --> 00:57:14,104
It's my hut. I built it.

423
00:57:14,278 --> 00:57:16,314
That's not true. I helped you.

424
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:19,242
I did most of it.
You can find some other place to live.

425
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:22,920
I said I was sorry, Richard.
What more do you want me to say?

426
00:57:23,162 --> 00:57:25,551
I don't want you to say anything.

427
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:30,969
I don't ever want to see you again.

428
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:35,447
You just wait, Richard Lestrange.
I'll get you for this!

429
00:58:44,036 --> 00:58:45,867
What's wrong with you?

430
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,768
Go away.

431
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:56,011
What happened?

432
00:58:56,716 --> 00:59:00,231
I stepped on one of those fish
that looks like a rock.

433
00:59:06,893 --> 00:59:08,292
Don't go to sleep.

434
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,618
Oh, no. Please wake up.

435
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:15,053
God.

436
00:59:17,905 --> 00:59:19,418
Take me to God.

437
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:21,931
But the law...

438
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:27,002
God...

439
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:30,987
...please don't make Em never wake up.

440
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:34,745
I didn't mean it when I said
I wanted her dead and buried.

441
01:00:37,278 --> 01:00:39,917
I forgot most of my prayers, God...

442
01:00:42,283 --> 01:00:43,272
But...

443
01:00:47,746 --> 01:00:49,338
Our Father...

444
01:00:51,959 --> 01:00:53,597
...who art in heaven...

445
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,239
...kingdom come...

446
01:01:10,436 --> 01:01:12,586
...with liberty and justice for all.

447
01:01:13,023 --> 01:01:14,012
Amen.

448
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,639
Em, are you all right?

449
01:01:44,054 --> 01:01:45,692
I've been so worried.

450
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,993
You mean, you're not mad at me anymore?

451
01:01:51,312 --> 01:01:52,791
Of course not.

452
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:56,741
I was so scared.

453
01:02:02,199 --> 01:02:03,951
All I could think of was:

454
01:02:06,744 --> 01:02:08,462
What if I lost my Em?

455
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:14,217
What would I do?

456
01:02:49,204 --> 01:02:52,514
Here's some food
to help you get your strength back.

457
01:02:56,755 --> 01:02:59,144
Do you see that island out there?

458
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:01,076
Yes.

459
01:03:01,927 --> 01:03:04,999
I've been thinking, maybe the person
who makes the drum noise...

460
01:03:05,221 --> 01:03:07,974
...lives there and then comes here to pray.

461
01:03:09,476 --> 01:03:10,625
Maybe.

462
01:03:11,978 --> 01:03:14,208
Would you like to try to walk?

463
01:03:29,621 --> 01:03:30,815
You all right?

464
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:32,443
Yes.

465
01:05:17,439 --> 01:05:18,667
Kiss me.

466
01:05:19,233 --> 01:05:20,905
You're all sticky.

467
01:05:21,235 --> 01:05:23,112
So what? Kiss me.

468
01:05:28,034 --> 01:05:29,752
Stop it, I can't breath.

469
01:05:29,952 --> 01:05:31,943
But I don't want to stop.

470
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:36,218
What are you doing?

471
01:05:44,176 --> 01:05:45,404
Stop it.

472
01:06:03,028 --> 01:06:05,258
I feel so funny in my stomach.

473
01:06:09,202 --> 01:06:10,430
Me, too.

474
01:06:15,834 --> 01:06:17,904
My heart is beating so fast.

475
01:06:20,797 --> 01:06:22,116
Mine, too.

476
01:12:45,024 --> 01:12:47,492
Will you stop eating? You're getting fat.

477
01:12:51,531 --> 01:12:53,681
Come on up, keep me warm?

478
01:13:15,472 --> 01:13:17,110
Where's Em, Coco?

479
01:13:55,638 --> 01:13:57,356
I'm sorry, Richard.

480
01:13:57,557 --> 01:14:00,025
You didn't want it all day yesterday either.

481
01:14:00,225 --> 01:14:02,785
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?

482
01:14:02,979 --> 01:14:05,732
Yes, I love you more than ever, Richard.

483
01:14:06,232 --> 01:14:08,302
Then why don't you want to do it?

484
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,625
It just hurts right now, that's all.

485
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:15,142
When it stops hurting, we'll do it.

486
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,156
When is that going to be?

487
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:23,003
I don't understand. Why does it hurt?

488
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,392
I don't know.

489
01:14:25,877 --> 01:14:27,708
I don't know anything.

490
01:14:31,383 --> 01:14:34,341
But if you touch my tummy right now,
you can feel it.

491
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:38,122
Feel what?

492
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:45,955
How did you make
your tummy move like that?

493
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:47,787
I'm not doing it.

494
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,968
It's not doing it by itself.

495
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,923
Yes, it is.

496
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,779
There. I felt it again.

497
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,442
What's making it do that?

498
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:02,221
I don't know.

499
01:15:37,201 --> 01:15:38,680
Where are you?

500
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,877
Where are you?

501
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:07,549
What's wrong? Did they hurt you?

502
01:18:08,272 --> 01:18:09,387
They?

503
01:18:24,581 --> 01:18:26,970
What is it? Tell me what to do.

504
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:28,520
What is it?

505
01:18:29,836 --> 01:18:31,155
Answer me.

506
01:19:36,738 --> 01:19:38,376
Why did you have a baby?

507
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:40,673
I don't know.

508
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:46,813
Hello, baby.

509
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,296
Look, I think he's hungry.

510
01:20:00,596 --> 01:20:02,393
What do you feed him?

511
01:20:02,681 --> 01:20:04,239
Try some fruit.

512
01:20:05,809 --> 01:20:07,208
Here you go.

513
01:20:09,939 --> 01:20:11,531
Good food. Fruit.

514
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,992
It doesn't like it.

515
01:20:14,527 --> 01:20:16,324
Here, let me try this.

516
01:20:25,872 --> 01:20:27,305
What do I do?

517
01:21:08,749 --> 01:21:10,307
Why are you doing that?

518
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,859
The drum people.

519
01:21:12,087 --> 01:21:13,202
What?

520
01:21:14,922 --> 01:21:15,991
I saw them.

521
01:21:16,465 --> 01:21:17,534
When?

522
01:21:17,674 --> 01:21:19,346
The night he came.

523
01:21:20,428 --> 01:21:22,020
What did they look like?

524
01:21:22,304 --> 01:21:24,772
I don't want to talk about it.
Paddy was right.

525
01:21:24,974 --> 01:21:26,851
We shouldn't have gone to the other side.

526
01:21:27,018 --> 01:21:29,054
We should have never broken the law.

527
01:21:29,228 --> 01:21:31,617
- Do they know we're here?
- I don't think so.

528
01:21:31,814 --> 01:21:34,169
If they come,
I'll do to them what I do to the fish.

529
01:21:34,359 --> 01:21:35,997
I'll stick it through their eyes!

530
01:21:36,153 --> 01:21:40,271
I'll stick it through their bellies
and watch their guts come out!

531
01:22:07,142 --> 01:22:10,612
Remember on the ship
when we tried to get to the dinghy...

532
01:22:11,229 --> 01:22:13,982
...how the men
pushed and shoved each other?

533
01:22:15,693 --> 01:22:17,524
How their eyes looked?

534
01:22:18,779 --> 01:22:21,373
It was the same with the drum people.

535
01:22:24,827 --> 01:22:29,423
I don't understand. Why do people
have to be so bad to each other?

536
01:25:50,872 --> 01:25:52,305
Come here, hurry.

537
01:25:52,832 --> 01:25:54,470
I'm busy keeping watch.

538
01:25:54,751 --> 01:25:56,901
Come on, you have to see this.

539
01:26:22,196 --> 01:26:24,107
You taught him to swim.

540
01:27:26,888 --> 01:27:28,958
Water.

541
01:27:32,893 --> 01:27:34,372
Look at the fishies.

542
01:27:36,063 --> 01:27:37,940
Around the tree and back down the hole.

543
01:27:42,862 --> 01:27:44,295
Get the boat.

544
01:28:35,624 --> 01:28:38,741
Look at the bird. Look, Paddy.

545
01:28:45,509 --> 01:28:47,864
Do you see some fishies?
What do you see?

546
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:50,143
Tell me, do you see a ship?

547
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,293
Paddy, fan.

548
01:29:04,695 --> 01:29:05,923
Richard.

549
01:29:07,032 --> 01:29:08,545
He said my name.

550
01:29:14,998 --> 01:29:17,592
Look, Paddy, we're making footprints.

551
01:29:17,959 --> 01:29:19,711
Like Boston in the winter.

552
01:29:19,878 --> 01:29:23,473
Remember the snowball fights we had
every time it snowed?

553
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:28,932
See, it's freezing.

554
01:29:30,973 --> 01:29:32,292
It's cold.

555
01:29:38,147 --> 01:29:40,217
The bogeyman.

556
01:29:54,831 --> 01:29:58,301
You better bring him up to see
or he'll hear about it from the crew...

557
01:29:58,542 --> 01:30:01,136
...and we'll have to sail back tomorrow.

558
01:30:02,129 --> 01:30:03,357
Excuse me, sir.

559
01:30:03,547 --> 01:30:05,344
We sighted something.

560
01:30:11,097 --> 01:30:12,325
There.

561
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,692
What do you think?

562
01:30:15,894 --> 01:30:17,532
Can we go closer?

563
01:30:18,522 --> 01:30:21,673
I'll see,
but we have to be careful of that reef.

564
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,183
Look at that face.

565
01:30:34,997 --> 01:30:36,112
Boat.

566
01:31:13,871 --> 01:31:15,907
No, that couldn't be them.

567
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:54,715
Do you know how to get to
the place where we lived with Paddy?

568
01:31:54,954 --> 01:31:57,343
Sure. I go there for bananas.

569
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:58,973
Take me there?

570
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:01,217
I thought you were afraid.

571
01:32:01,377 --> 01:32:03,288
I want to see it again.

572
01:32:06,132 --> 01:32:07,451
In you go.

573
01:32:44,171 --> 01:32:45,524
You coming?

574
01:35:33,261 --> 01:35:34,410
Shark!

575
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:56,338
I have to get the oars.

576
01:36:02,082 --> 01:36:03,993
Help me, Em, we're drifting.

577
01:36:08,631 --> 01:36:10,064
Go away.

578
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:20,886
Look how far out we are!

579
01:36:39,537 --> 01:36:41,209
I can't stop this.

580
01:37:23,123 --> 01:37:24,351
Paddy, look.

581
01:37:24,791 --> 01:37:27,066
When it hits the water,
you can hear it hiss.

582
01:37:27,254 --> 01:37:28,573
Look, see?

583
01:37:28,713 --> 01:37:29,941
Hear it?

584
01:37:44,646 --> 01:37:45,522
I'm thirsty.

585
01:37:46,481 --> 01:37:47,994
I wish we had some water.

586
01:38:06,793 --> 01:38:07,987
Fishies.

587
01:38:11,757 --> 01:38:13,873
No, Paddy!

588
01:38:14,343 --> 01:38:17,062
- Where did you get those?
- Get those out of your mouth.

589
01:38:17,262 --> 01:38:21,380
What are you doing?
Get those out of your mouth.

590
01:38:28,274 --> 01:38:29,946
He swallowed some.

591
01:38:45,959 --> 01:38:47,278
Come here.

592
01:38:58,262 --> 01:39:00,014
Don't close your eyes, Paddy.

593
01:39:00,182 --> 01:39:02,173
Please don't go to sleep.

594
01:39:12,736 --> 01:39:13,725
Please.

595
01:40:55,175 --> 01:40:59,134
Three points to port, sir.
Looks to be a small craft.

596
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:01,157
See anyone in it?

597
01:41:01,598 --> 01:41:03,350
I can't make it out.

598
01:41:05,852 --> 01:41:08,764
Captain, three points to port.

599
01:42:16,049 --> 01:42:17,528
Are they dead?

600
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:22,131
No, sir. They're asleep.
