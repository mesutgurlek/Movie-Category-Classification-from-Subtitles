159
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,074
She's certainly a very
enthusiastic young woman.

160
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,643
- Where did you find her?
- 53rd street.

161
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,113
She had a leaky faucet.

162
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,750
Ah yes, the famous
leaky faucet
of 53rd street.

163
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,686
Aren't you
sorry you gave up
a promising career

164
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,321
- In real estate?
- No.

165

- She's never gonna
be one of us.
- No, I know.

168
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,970
Isn't that great?

...A million miles away.

172
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,798
It's just like picking off
another part of your forehead.

173
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,699
I'll burn you.
Just you.

The rest of you,

187
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:10,748
We're going-- ahem.
We're going skiing.

197

Whatever happened

201

You'd be

204
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,769
I'm not.

205
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,506
Is it awful?

Awful?
Is it awful?

207
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,712
No, it's not awful
at all.

208
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,614
It's just different,
that's all.

209
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,316
It's just
very different.

210
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,451
You know, everybody
talks to each other

211
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,887
And there's a ham
with pineapples on it

212
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,356
With little cherries
in the middle.

213
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,692
- Cherries,
I like those cherries.
- Yeah, I like them too.

214
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,028
It's just really different.

Yeah.

00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,704
We just wanted to do it,
to make it official.

221
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,612
It's $39.50 each.

222
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,748
That includes
a generous tip.

223

<i>Oh.</i>

<i>Sanford:
So the guy's not selling</i>

230
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,621
And his kids are starving.
And he's sitting on the world's

Most valuable butcher shop.

232
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,860

He used to say

00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:28,980
To ask me
to join the firm.

240
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,982
It was understood.
I understood it.

241
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,217
Your brother

We're happy here, okay?

00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,125
Settled?
You think she's happy here?

245
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,831
- Isn't she?
- You think she had
this dump in mind

246
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,567
When she left mineola?
When she laid eyes on you?

247
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,502
No, she had more in mind

248
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,305
And she deserves better.
She's a beautiful woman.

249
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,574
Just like your mother.

250
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,879
- Thanks for visiting.
- Thank you, honey.

251
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,816

<i>And I agreed to go
into the family business.</i>

261
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,938
Some of our times square tenants
pay their rent in cash,

262
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,107
So you'll pick it up
in person.

the address of the luxor.

When you get down there,
you'll see why I'm sending you.

265
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,416
These people are not
really corporate.

266
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,987
But these properties need
to pay for themselves.

267
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,556
That is, until we
tear 'em down.

And ultimately

I think maybe you can
manage the whole area.

Well, it's good to have

- When did she pass away?
- Pass away?

370

She jumped off the roof,

Cracked her skull open like
a walnut on the driveway.

He hid under a table for a week.

Nothing.

anything to her.

00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:26,829
You can have
access to his money,
but if you separate,

658
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:30,900
If you divorce him,
you won't get any money,
because he doesn't have any.

- Motherfuckers.
- Regardless,

661
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:38,808
Families like the marks
set their assets up this way

00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,744
<i>- To protect them
from divorces.
- Motherfuckers!</i>

Okay, could you just not--
just not do that?

664

These people play hardball.

<i>If you want a settlement,</i>

It's a family matter.

It's not just that you

- Solly. Good to see you.
- You too.

My pleasure.

Now what can I
do for you?

Mr. Marik, if you
question my decisions once more,
I'll order you off this bridge.

01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:58,158
You're not giving orders

So malvern came at you
with a gun?</i>

<i>David:
That's correct.</i>

1116

<i>He, uh,
had been evicted</i>

<i>Uh, there was a struggle</i>

1123

call the police?</i>

1128

would believe me.</i>

- Your past.</i>
