1
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,497
- Who's dealt the last time, you or me?

2
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,413
...me, who else...

3
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,133
...one card for you......one card for me.

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,256
...three for you, one for me.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,920
...four for me, one for you.

6
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,400
...five for me.

7
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,000
...shit cards

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,150
...you feel lucky, eh?
No more cards for you? Ah well, just asking...

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,500
...how many cards do you want?
Three...?

10
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,380
...one for me, one for you, one for me, one for you....

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,300
...you stand no chance...

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,210
...with cards like those...

13
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,410
...I'll show you...! You cretin...
My time has come!

14
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,900
(singing...): "My pack of beasts is one of a kind...."

15
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,852
- Dad!

16
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,640
...check out that ship, dad!

17
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,690
- Let's see those cards...

18
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,500
...I have three...

19
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,990
- Dad!

20
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,340
- Great hand!...
Interrupt me again and I'll smack you!

21
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,400
...you know I hate being interrupted!

22
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,000
- When I get married,
Will you buy me a truck like that?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,400
- Three cards.
And you? Nothing to add? Bravo, bravo...

24
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,490
...and for you? Two cards...

25
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,380
- Dad, check out that machine!
- Lovely hand. Three Aces. Three lil' cards...

26
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,910
...Daaad, Promise, when I get married!

27
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,550
- Two Sevens.
- What a machine...

28
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,574
- Screw your machine!

29
00:02:30,574 --> 00:02:33,130
- Dad, come here!

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
- I told you, not to interrupt
when I'm playing cards!

31
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,950
- Daddy likes you, and you don't give a shit about him...
keeps bloody interrupting....

32
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:58,210
- One for me, one for you, one for me, one for you....

33
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,970
...cards are like whores. They can get pretty addictive...

34
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,970
...who do you think I am?
I could as well bluff!

35
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,055
...gimme two more cards!

36
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,776
- Maxim Gorky is here! The Russians!

37
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,090
...look at this. Poker dammit, Poker!
Maradona!

38
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,100
- Hurry up, Zare!
- Oi, give my eggs back!

39
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,010
- How much for the horns, comrade?

40
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,890
- Ten marks.

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,440
- Ten marks.

42
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,400
- Look, I'll give you five.

43
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,100
- No way. Ten.

44
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,200
- Dad, what do you want with it?
- Shut up! I ain't stupid! It is secondary raw material.

45
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,000
- One horn for five marks. One million horns, five million marks. Isn't it, comrade?

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,010
- Sure.

47
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,455
- How much for the washing machine?
- 300 marks.

48
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,300
- Fine machine. Extra good.

49
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:06,057
- Comrade. Let me tell you something even better...
220 marks for the horns, the washing machine and the computer. Great deal, isn't it?

50
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,260
- No way. 280.
- 250.

51
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,090
- Sold.
- Take them.

52
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,630
- Should I help, Dad?
- It's all right.

53
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,300
- The other side!

54
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,610
- Careful, Dad!!

55
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,110
- The washing machine...!

56
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,040
- Hey!

57
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,337
- The Russians have fucking scammed us once again!

58
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,450
- Come, have a look.

59
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,616
- We got water, not Diesel!

60
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,900
- What?

61
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,370
- I'm sayin', water. Have a look.

62
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,370
- What the hell?

63
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,550
- That's Diesel all right!

64
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,000
- This is water!
- The barrels are full of water.

65
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,700
- Both barrels?

66
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:08,137
(music): "The cold rain falls at dawn..."

67
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,020
- Why is she wearing spy-glasses
and a grater, do you know?

68
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:19,492
- She's expectant!
- Well said, smart kid...

69
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,976
- Here's money for your surgery.

70
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,400
- Thanks, uncle Grga! God bless uncle Grga!

71
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
- This is too little!
- What the hell's wrong?

72
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,400
- Mother will have twins, the u'trasound has told us!

73
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,000
- Piss off, back into your gypsy mother and away from me!

74
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,420
- Gate, gate!

75
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,660
- Halt, what do you want?

76
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,050
- G'day.
- Who are you?

77
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,090
- I'm Matko Destanov.
- Hands up!

78
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,000
...hands up!

79
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,400
- Goose, come in!

80
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,000
- I was planning to
go to Hungary tonight.

81
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,219
...to the fair in Pécs.

82
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
- Go to the fair wherever you like,
but do buy yourself a fiancée! Understood?

83
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,773
(background): - All right, everyone get the fuck out!
- Hello, boss.

84
00:09:49,773 --> 00:09:52,850
- Oh Little bird, you have returned?

85
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,650
- Me...? Back from where?

86
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,660
- You've been here before...5 years ago.
- Me? No.

87
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,372
- Don't lie to me!
- We have met indeed but you didn't live here at the time!

88
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,930
...big players like you relocate often!

89
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,650
- Eight years ago then.
- Eight? That's impossible.

90
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,500
...oh yes, yes, hats off! My compliments, uncle Grga!

91
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,730
- Look into my eyes.
- I am looking at them.

92
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,000
- Why are you here? And don't tell lies.

93
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,600
...I would do anything for your father.

94
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,580
...he saved my life twice.
- I know...

95
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,000
...in Genova, and in Marseille.

96
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:50,000
...he beat up half the city...to get me out of jail.

97
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,295
...he is a gentlemen.

98
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,458
- Was. May he rest in peace.

99
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:02,852
- Who should rest in peace?
- My father...haven't you heard?

100
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,250
...so unexpectedly...Would you have thought?

101
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,050
...I became an orphan...just like my little finger!

102
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,000
...unprotected...at everyone's mercy...

103
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,600
- I know that you lot ruined his life.
You swindlers, rotters, gangsters, vagabonds, thieves!

104
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,450
- Allright, allright, that didn't last too long! Everyone makes mistakes in life...

105
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,750
...but now I understand I was on the wrong path and have shown them the finger as the it's said...

106
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
...Uncle Grga, I have a bloody good business proposition!

107
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
- What kinda plan?
- A train.

108
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
- A train?
-A whole train.

109
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
...wagons loaded with gasoline.
- Gasoline?

110
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,369
- Twenty wagons altogether.

111
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,537
...but Uncle Grga, since my father died...

112
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,830
...I have nobody to help me.

113
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,070
- That's business for the big guys.

114
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,050
- They'll screw you.
You're a freshman.

115
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,936
- No, Uncle Grga. I've got it all
covered this time. No screwing over this time!

116
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,180
...I'll bring the paperwork, it's all here, clear as water.

117
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
....son! Son!
- You're lying again, aren't you?

118
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,900
- Don't come back without a wife!

119
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,100
- What are you up to now? You want to swindle him?

120
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,500
- Smile you dumbass.

121
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,574
- I received this urgent fax.
Everything's in there.

122
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,457
...all the details!

123
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:44,253
- Birdy! Come here. Come here.

124
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,490
- Goose, over...come in....goose...

125
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:01,000
- I'm here, uncle Grga. Everything's in the fax.

126
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,934
... I'd need 70,000 marks...

127
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,850
- What, boss?

128
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,400
- Goose, the labourers can go home.
And you too.

129
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,410
- All right, boss.
Let's have a break!

130
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,010
- If you loan me 70,000 within a
week I'll return you 100,000.

131
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,060
- Do you see that?

132
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,249
- I see it, uncle Grga. I see it.

133
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,858
...Uncle Grga, you sure have a lot of dosh.

134
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,490
- I'll help you, but only because of your father.

135
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,850
...and I fully expect you to report back to me all about this 'bloody lucrative business'

136
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:58,100
...or else I'll send my grandsons after you...
They'll skin you alive...

137
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,900
...and splinter your bones!

138
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,050
- Am I making myself clear?
- Very clear.

139
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:19,738
- Weirdo.
- Millions. Maradona.

140
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,210
- Why did you say that Granddad had died?

141
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,450
- He's in a hospital, or dead...
That's practically the same.

142
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,930
...he has a large cement factory
and never gave me a penny.

143
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,176
...Zare, my son. With this money
your daddy will ensure you have a future...

144
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,530
...and your children's future.

145
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,950
- Leave me be.
I'll never forgive you.

146
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,040
- Zare!

147
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,540
- Zare!

148
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,540
- What do you want now?

149
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,110
- Come son, take a look at this miracle!

150
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,930
- Now that's what I call an invention.

151
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,852
...only those Germans can
invent something like that.

152
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,650
...but your daddy promises you...

153
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,850
...if we become rich, he'll buy you a ship like that...

154
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,250
- Zare!

155
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,250
...Dadan...

156
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,374
...he's here! Our benefactor has arrived!

157
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,773
(music/singing...) "Pitbull.
Terrier...."

158
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,000
- Fortune favours the bold.

159
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,859
- Your mother....I keep you fed and this is how you thank me?!

160
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,090
- "The dice is cast."

161
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,000
- Welcome, my dear brother.
- Who is he?

162
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,055
- What the fuck do you care?
- I was only asking.

163
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:28,050
- Well shut the fuck up! Ehh...

164
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,000
- Ohhh fuck...
- So there's a God after all.

165
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,930
- What are you staring at? Stop staring. Chill out! Read something!

166
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,410
- Why did you come here?

167
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,000
- I'm sick of these thieves around...

168
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,020
- What are you waiting for?
Give the man something to drink. Quit fucking laming around...

169
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,090
- I've know of a lucrative plan.
- You?

170
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,370
- Trust me, it's 100% fail-safe.

171
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,500
...it's the plan of the millennium.

172
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,530
...I've got a connection in Jordan. He sells me a train full of gasoline.

173
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,853
...brilliant. A great buy.
- So why don't you buy it then?

174
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,250
- I'm broke...

175
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
...listen...I'd need a person to help me out at the customs...

176
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,010
- Don't worry about customers old pal.

177
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,657
...The Bulgarians always say: "Brother, if you
can't solve a problem with money...

178
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:40,579
...solve it with a lot of money. "

179
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,650
- Lil'o whiskey...

180
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,813
- What's this, eh? What's this?

181
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,000
...you're giving him whisky in a gin glass?
You hate him for being a gypsy, don't you?!

182
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
...you stupid bitch! Get the hell out!
- What's wrong?

183
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,299
- Get lost all of you! Get the fuck out!

184
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:02,731
...you too, out!
-Why?
- You picked her side too you cunt! Out!

185
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,938
- He said nothing!
-Get out! All of you!

186
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:05,540
...what?!

187
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,894
- Piss off! Piss the fuck off!

188
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:12,093
....get the hell out, suckers!
Stop trying to relax me dammit!

189
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,970
...I have no racial prejudices!
Fuck my life...

190
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,000
...huh, Matko?
- You have always been tolerant...with everyone...

191
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,653
...ever since you were a kid...
- Sorry.

192
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:28,810
- I would have been okay drinking out of the bottle too.
- No way! Cheers!

193
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,736
...on our deal! Let's drink!

194
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,000
- Ah you're such a cutie!

195
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,390
- You should find a wife for your son soon.
- Zare? He's not of age, but he is mature.

196
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,410
- Is he honest?
- One hundred percent. He's the most important for me.

197
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:02,000
- Good for you. You're the image of a real man.
Not like me, with that scum.

198
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,670
...this happens ever again and I'll fuck your junkie mothers you sons of bitches!!

199
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,230
- What you're whining about?
I don't get you...Apparently you're not short on anything.

200
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,270
- What's that to me? Tell me.

201
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,330
...am I successful? Yeah! I have a house as large as a castle.

202
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,616
...2,500 square metres.

203
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:34,000
...Take a look at the Old Man's mausoleum.
Even the State would be jealous of it!

204
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,373
- Ain't it beautiful?
- Very much so.

205
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,252
...why are you crying, Dadan? Don't cry.
- Why not?

206
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:52,650
...why shouldn't I cry? Lemme cry!
- It's a wonderful castle!

207
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,611
- It's a shame. A shame.
- What's a shame?

208
00:20:56,611 --> 00:21:01,660
- I can't marry out my sister.
That was Dad's dying wish!

209
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,130
...it's a disgrace!

210
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,170
- Don't you worry, my brother.
All will be well.

211
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,690
...But...we should close our little deal here...

212
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,050
...cheers.

213
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,000
- Hello! Hello! Hello, Aksim?

214
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
...I'm in deep shit...I could do with a bit of help here...

215
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:53,330
...I've heard you have a singer who can pull a nail out of logs using her ass?

216
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,890
- Go serve the customer.

217
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,090
- He'll let us know if he wants something.
- Then go water the pole.

218
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,900
- What's her name? Black Obelisk?
Fuck this shit, it's disconnected again.

219
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,530
...this fucking phone, it's killing me, it's eating my nerves!

220
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,070
...it's eating my whole life!

221
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:44,020
...damn it. Go water the telephone pole.
I can't hear a fucking word like this over the damn phone...

222
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,530
- May your phone die a horrible death...

223
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,610
- Hey you. Come here.

224
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,010
- Who? Me?

225
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,730
- Stop pretending you're waiting for someone.
I know you're after me...

226
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,050
- I only want a lemonade.

227
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,490
- Of course.

228
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,960
- How many times I need to tell you to water the pole?! Get on with it!

229
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,090
- What's up?
- Go pour the water on the pole!

230
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,010
- What a "man"...lol.

231
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,930
- Get goin'!

232
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,840
- Hey Aksim, I can't hear a fucking word...nothing!

233
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,050
- What are you waiting for?
- You're pouring it yet?

234
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,170
- I can hear you now better,
much, much better!

235
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:56,670
...listen! Get on the fast train and be here by tomorrow as there's a show to be done!

236
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,770
- Hey, no lemonade for me?!

237
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,970
- You'll get that
when the geese grow a beard. Bleeeh!

238
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,930
- Music!

239
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,650
- My dear grandson.

240
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,950
- I got your stuff for you.

241
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,630
- What does the doc say?

242
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:11,650
- All sorts of bollocks. I'll live to be a hundred unless the devil takes me!

243
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,250
- And your liver?
- Completely gone to pot. Useless.

244
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,770
- You shouldn't drink that much.

245
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,090
- What do you mean? This time I'll be getting really drunk for once!

246
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,250
...time for me to get wasted!

247
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,280
- This is a hospital!
Music isn't allowed here, what are you thinking?!

248
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,010
- Doctor, you've got to make
an end to this.

249
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,410
- Imagine what it would be like if
all patients left the hospital with an orchestra!

250
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:46,650
- Ma'am, you really needn't be so cross! No need for it at all, no need!

251
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,610
...here's a bit of money for you!

252
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,290
- Freedom!!

253
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,810
- Excellent booze. Burns my intestines...

254
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,640
- Grandson, I've got to tell you something.

255
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,660
...your mother is dead, and your father is a filthy bastard.

256
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,480
- I sold the cement factory.
- You sold it?!

257
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,370
- Aye, that I did. It's gone now, just like if I never had it in the first place!

258
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,370
...check this out!

259
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,050
...I sold it to that dirtbag Dadan.

260
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,130
...your future is safe. If you need money,
go to my friend...

261
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,490
...whom I haven't seen in 25 years.
His name is...

262
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,210
- I know. Grga Pitic.
- You know of him?

263
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:17,730
- You've told me about your friendship
a thousand times.

264
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,690
- A seven-foot-tall giant with
hands like shovels.

265
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,610
...he's got two rows of teeth.

266
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,450
...one the regular, but the other is golden!

267
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,340
...elegant as a vampire.

268
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,210
- Music... attack!!

269
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,610
- Shoot here you asshole, shoot here!

270
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:16,650
...Here's a flowerpot! And another one. Have this too!
Kill my children and family too!

271
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,140
- What are you doing?!

272
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,140
- Hey, leave me alone! It's okay, I'm goin', I'm goin'!
- You son of a bitch!

273
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,100
...careful now, I'll beat the shit out of you!

274
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,900
... I'll get you!
- You old monkey!

275
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,340
- I shit on Death!

276
00:28:51,340 --> 00:29:01,110
- I'll get you, you're mine now, I'll smash your bloody face!

277
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:37,170
"Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship. "

278
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,010
- Boss, try this please, what do you think about the tase?

279
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,890
- Our whisky is better than the real thing.

280
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,210
- Logical. Our method is better.

281
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,330
- Where are you, children?
- We're here, grandpa.

282
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,970
- Sit down.

283
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,490
- That's enough, children.

284
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,570
- You, what have you've been up to?
- You know, you sent me to the fair to find a wife.

285
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,450
- We've been to ten...twenty fairs!
- And you managed to find one?

286
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,490
- I asked something, jackass.

287
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:03,370
- I can find women for entertainment or to foul around with, but good wife-to-be...that's difficult!

288
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,370
- Be ashamed. All your friends are married
and have children.

289
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,930
...when I was your age I had
been married four times.

290
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,050
...it's all about taste.

291
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,370
...don't be fussy. Find a girl and get it over with.

292
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:22,930
- Granddad, tell us about number five
The one that stole your heart?

293
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,740
...we love listening to that story a lot.

294
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,930
- My darling.

295
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,450
...even the memory of her is
enough to lighten my heart.

296
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,490
...my little dove...

297
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,170
- Blood doesn't turn into water.

298
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,250
...if you managed to find the right one for yourself, so will I!

299
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,200
- When will that be?
Are you just waiting for me to die?!

300
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,930
- Why won't you be a good boy and
marry for him.

301
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,530
- Yesterday I had another stroke.
I can barely see.

302
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,290
- Again?
- Again.

303
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:12,290
- I beg you for the last time:
Find yourself a wife.

304
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,970
...take me to the hospital
to recover.

305
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,410
...I'll get out for your wedding.

306
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,810
...bring me a daughter in law.

307
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,050
- Ok, grandad.

308
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,570
- Kssss, cat.

309
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,130
- Black cats are bad luck.

310
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,930
- Take care of the passenger train,
I'll take the goods train.

311
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,650
- My lil'o train!

312
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,210
- One...

313
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,040
...two, three...

314
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,130
...five...

315
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,010
...six...

316
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,460
(inaudible)

317
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,450
...eighteen...

318
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,650
- Boo!
- Oh Devla! <i>[god]</i>

319
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,210
- All's well?

320
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,450
...this calls for a celebration. Drink up!

321
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,930
- I am scared shitless of being screwed.

322
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,370
- I made a promise, a promise is a promise!

323
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,610
- And money is money! Everyone got what they're after.

324
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,780
...I'm paranoid to think about what will happen once the train is at the customs.
Hope nobody's going to screw us now!
- Chill out friend!

325
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,610
- Cheers.

326
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,370
- Why are you hiding?

327
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:00,650
...I call the shots around here.
Relax! Come!

328
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,890
...get in here!

329
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,330
...I'll keep the suitcase!

330
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,480
- But I gave everybody their share.
- Everything' okay...

331
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:59,940
- That's it guys, that's all there is.
- Where's the rest?

332
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,290
- It's all, I swear on the Bible.

333
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,130
- Brother! There must be a misunderstanding.

334
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,130
- Thou shall die now!

335
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,130
...filthy rat!
Don't shoot!
-Bang, bang, bang!!

336
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,210
- Shame on you.

337
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,570
- Here's the little birdy.
He's sleeping.

338
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:24,780
- My suitcase!
Give it back! Give it back you douche-bag!...you son of a bitch!

339
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,090
...rot, die! You filthy fucktard!

340
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:51,500
...stop jumping around, jackass!
Stop doing this to me! Get down!

341
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,690
...come back down dammit!

342
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,420
...fuck I don't need your shoes!

343
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,810
...so be it! I'm coming for you!

344
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,770
...it is time
for you and me...

345
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,090
...to look each other in the eye.

346
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:27,770
...just you and me. You worthless dumbass! You second class cum!

347
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,330
...there...finally!

348
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,330
...man, this is way too high.

349
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,050
- That's Dadan, thank God!

350
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,570
- Dadan, It's me. Matko.

351
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,520
- The train has disappeared!
- Gone?!

352
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,250
...didn't it cross the border?

353
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,490
...answer me. Where are my 17 wagons
I paid for in advance?

354
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,490
- It crossed the border 30 minutes ago.
It's has to be here somewhere.

355
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,450
- Here? Where?
You don't lose track of a train.

356
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,050
- I can't remember anything. Somebody bloody drugged me.
I was asleep for only 10 minutes.

357
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,930
- Ah come on, who would do such a thing?

358
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,450
- He did. This cum!

359
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:52,050
...it was him.
- That pig?

360
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,130
- My Bulgarian custom officers
didn't see no train.

361
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,490
- They're lying. They're double crossing,
but they will have to pay.

362
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,930
- A train rides on track,
not just randomly through the woods.

363
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,730
...it can't just have gone up in smoke,
or can it? Boss?

364
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,850
- No way, dammit.

365
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,410
- My dear audience...

366
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,290
...after a triumphant tour in
North-Africa, Asia and Australia...

367
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:41,850
...I'm proud to present to you in your quiet riverside village:
The Black Obelisk.

368
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,770
...an act, never seen before:

369
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:50,650
...to pull a nail from a beam
in the most spectacular fashion.

370
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,690
- It wasn't an ordinary fight,
but more one man against King Kong.

371
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,410
- Which one?
- What do you mean?

372
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,170
- That big ol' chunky Bulgarian!

373
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:04,930
...I've never seen a man that big! That jerk could only pass the
doorway sideways.

374
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,570
- What's your name?
- Rambo.

375
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:12,210
- A warm welcome for this
young man named Rambo.

376
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,770
- Your moment has come! Hit it!
- Enough!
- My honoured guests...

377
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:21,650
...the great, unforgettable,
breathtaking moment is near.

378
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:26,290
...a moment you'll remember throughout your life!
- Bravo!!

379
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,410
- I proposed an honest fight. I've said it: "honest fight!"

380
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,320
...but he kicked me in the balls.

381
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,250
...I grabbed him by the hair and whirled
his head around. He went crazy!

382
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:45,050
...but I really paid attention not to foil our plan in front of the Customs officers...
I'm good, eh?

383
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:41,070
- You'll return all my money tonight.
Your deadline is at 11 o'clock.

384
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:45,210
...if you don't, I'll hang you by the balls
on the windmill.

385
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,440
...so you can get your head aired a bit...

386
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,810
- Awful...

387
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,410
- So how will it be? Will I have the money?

388
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,050
- There's a bit of an issue.

389
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,130
...three wagons were supposed to be mine.

390
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:34,050
- I've got a better plan.
There's a different solution.

391
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:39,490
Yesterday I bought your father's factory
in the hospital.

392
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,570
- The cement factory?
- Aye. I paid him a fair price.

393
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,890
...ask him if you don't believe me.

394
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,890
- But it's not enough to cover your debt.
It's only two thirds.

395
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,950
...I have an even better plan! Much better!

396
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:15,010
- You have a marriageable son.
And I've got a marriageable sister.
- And?

397
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:22,650
- We arrange a big fat wedding
and forget your debt.

398
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,410
- I'll give you anything you want, Dadan.
But that's impossible. - Why?

399
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,650
- I'll bet on the nail.

400
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,370
- Name?

401
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,890
- Dadan, don't do this to me, you can't ask such as huge favour!

402
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,330
...your sister is 25, my son 17.

403
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,930
- Younger men like ripe women.

404
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,460
- That's not all, Dadan.

405
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,090
- What else?
- You know, you know.

406
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,490
...she looks like a little Smurf.
Everyone calls her little Lady-bird.

407
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,970
- So what? A diamond is small,
but valuable.

408
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,530
- Final bets please! Anyone?

409
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,930
- Hands off!

410
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,210
- Do we have a deal? Give me your hand!

411
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,210
- No. I've got it figured now.

412
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,780
...I know who stole my train
and drugged me.

413
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,640
...and who messed with my father!
You stole my heritage! There's no deal!

414
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,690
- Safet. Kazatchok.

415
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,970
- You stole from my father! And from me too!

416
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,730
- This way! Bit further down!

417
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,120
- Watch! The moment of truth has come!

418
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,370
- I love the huge ass!

419
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,620
- I certainly don't envy your husband!

420
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,490
- Attention!

421
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,570
...one, two, three... freedom!

422
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,170
- Oi! What are you doing?!

423
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,610
- Is this seat taken?

424
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,530
- What do you want?
- Lemonade.

425
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,610
- Hey you.
- Me?

426
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,450
- Get me an ice cream!

427
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,050
- I'm not an errand boy.

428
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,970
- Come on, you're always following me around,
might as well make yourself useful.

429
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,330
- Don't you think so?
- Exactly.

430
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,050
- Out of the way!

431
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,890
- Strawberry or vanilla?

432
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,720
- Strawberry and vanilla. Four servings.

433
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,210
- You're off?

434
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,050
...come back.

435
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,530
...I've got to tell you something.

436
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,290
...you're in a hurry or what?
- Just wanted my lemonade.

437
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,490
- Shame you're getting married.

438
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,850
...you're a bit young for me but rather handsome.

439
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,690
...I could fall in love with you...

440
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,460
...but there's no point when you're getting married.

441
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,730
- Married? Who's getting married?

442
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,610
...I'm only thinking of you.

443
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,280
...you're the only reason for my presence here.

444
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,130
- Hardly matters now...

445
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,720
- You've been fouled.
Someone's setting me up.

446
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:37,410
...I'm way too young to get married.

447
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,250
- But you are actually engaged!

448
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,330
...I overheard your father and Dadan
in my grandma's inn.

449
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,730
...they agreed last night.

450
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,450
...it's a shame. Here.

451
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,900
- Woe to my head...aaargh!

452
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,690
...Dadan has the factory now. All gone. Whoosh!

453
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:54,610
- And now he wants me too.
That bastard is like highwaymen. Such a jerk.

454
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,810
- He got the train, the factory...
What else does he want?

455
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,650
- What else?

456
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,850
...his mother's pussy.

457
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,050
- The Russians are here.

458
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,210
- The water is nice.

459
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,480
- There's something else...

460
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,890
...that Dadan.

461
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:22,570
- he wants to arrange a marriage
to pay of my debt.

462
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,720
- A marriage?

463
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,610
- For our child Zare and his sister.

464
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,850
...The Lady-bird.

465
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:36,600
- That bawler, the midget?

466
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,810
...that ass-plug dwarf!

467
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:44,730
- We need to ask for assistance.
We'll have to go and see Grga Pitic!

468
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,000
...he's my friend, he'll help us.

469
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,530
- It's a bit late for that.
...he's my friend, he'll help us.

470
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:48,730
- It's a bit late for that.

471
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:55,090
...Grga Pitic...is dead.

472
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,290
- Dead?

473
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,450
- God have mercy on his soul.
I haven't had a drink yet...

474
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,610
...but I'll have one now
for his salvation.

475
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,370
- Grandfather.

476
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:50,010
- There's my grandson.

477
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:52,290
...ain't he handsome?

478
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:57,290
- Grandfather, I got you some oranges.

479
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,690
- Now be nice and say hello.

480
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,690
- Hello, nurse.

481
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,370
- Have you seen her?
- Who?

482
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,130
- The girl.

483
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,090
-  No.

484
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,970
- She's the nurse.

485
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,650
...they call her Candy.

486
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,330
...those boobies, that body.

487
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:25,170
...and that tiny butt. All so delicate.

488
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:29,290
- You know for me it's love at first sight,
or nothing at all.

489
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,120
- Love at first sight? Ridiculous.

490
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,370
- The son of your deceased friend Zarija
dropped by.

491
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,210
...he came for help.

492
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,530
...all his money has been stolen.

493
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:46,090
...can we settle this, together with Little Grga?

494
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:50,130
...we'll skin them alive, and pump them full of lead.

495
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,010
- Nah, I first want to see the grave of Zarija.

496
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,050
- As you will, granddad.

497
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,930
...it was only a proposition.

498
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,130
- Nobody listens to me. I'm talking to you!
- Miss! Please!

499
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:07,410
- I'm not getting married this way.
- Shame on you.

500
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,930
- Miss, let me take measurements please!

501
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,450
- You're my greatest enemy.

502
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,040
...you're no brother to me.
You're a tyrant!

503
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,890
- Must our parents
curse me from their grave?

504
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,730
- No, no no and no!! I don't want to marry.

505
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,690
...I'm not getting married. Do you hear me?

506
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,650
...I am not doing it! Not even if you kill me. I'll wait for my true love!

507
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,730
- 168.
- Who is it?

508
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,730
...tell me. Who is it? The true love?

509
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,240
- I've seen him in my dreams. I'll find him one day.

510
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:46,050
...I saw him a hundred times in my dreams.
I know what he looks like.

511
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,290
...I know his eyes,
his face, his lips.

512
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,180
...He's big, very big...
- Neck measurements...13...

513
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:55,050
- Which big man would want you,
stupid goose?

514
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,330
...an ass-plug like yourself?

515
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,410
- You'll see, he'll come one day!

516
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,890
- Breast, 88.
- Shut up! Leave me alone.

517
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,410
- Safet.

518
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,170
...cool her down.
- Leave me be!!

519
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,200
- Stop arguing with me in my own home!

520
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,330
- Let me go!
I'll marry the man I love, whether you agree or not!

521
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:40,170
- Pull.

522
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,610
- Aaaaye, my little sister!

523
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,730
...what are you doing? Our father is looking down upon us!

524
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:01,370
- Changed your mind yet?

525
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,900
...I'll turn you into a garden gnome!

526
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,690
...son of a....go on.

527
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,540
- I don't want to! I'll marry the man I love!

528
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:16,700
- Do you even have a soul?
Our parents are watching from above.

529
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,920
- They can't see shit, it's cloudy!

530
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,540
- Party!

531
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,540
- Come on! Party I said!

532
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,890
- That's great Dadan, good luck to you!

533
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:07,770
- Move over, let the lady sit.

534
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,210
- Congratulations.

535
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,130
- Do you want something to drink?
- Coffee.

536
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,450
- Only coffee?
- Only coffee.

537
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,650
- You need any help?

538
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,320
- Ask Matko, that dumbass.

539
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:32,370
...make sure there's food, I don't trust him.

540
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:40,170
- The one who looks like a vampire
and the monkey face are both married.

541
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,290
...so only the little one is left.

542
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,530
...the poor Lady-bird

543
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,250
- That midget?

544
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,490
- Yes, in her bridal gown.

545
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,330
...all yours, take her!

546
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,050
- Never.

547
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:59,650
- I'm here for business.

548
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,130
- What business, Sujka?

549
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:03,760
- You marry my Ida.

550
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,090
...I see she pleases you.

551
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,850
- You won't find a prettier girl
in the whole region.

552
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:18,610
...I fed her from her birth.

553
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,650
...we've been everywhere.

554
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:24,210
...gave her medicines
to make her beautiful.

555
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,410
...to buy her Italian clothes...

556
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:33,330
...we went to Rome and Napels.
- Liar.

557
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,130
...I showed her all countries.

558
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:39,700
...in the end we went to Sweden.

559
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,050
- I know. To beg.

560
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:49,970
- Still better to beg than to scavenge in the rubbish.
- That's what you did!
- Do you have anything against it?

561
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,410
- How much do you want for her?

562
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,210
- Give me 35,000 marks.

563
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,450
- Grandma.

564
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,730
- 15,000, in two installations.

565
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:08,730
- What do you think I am?

566
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,490
- 17,000 in three parts?
- Give it in one installation.

567
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,330
...and I don't want see you ever again.

568
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,730
- She's selling you like cattle.

569
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,410
- Never.

570
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,490
- Carry me.

571
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,570
...come on, carry me!

572
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,050
...you're really handsome you know.

573
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,410
..and now...kiss me.

574
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,330
- Damn tie.

575
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,690
...save me, grandpa. Don't let me be married.

576
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,330
...I'll drink his blood.

577
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,890
- Where you're off to?

578
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:32,320
...let go of that!
- I'll kill him!

579
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:34,580
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Give it to me!

580
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,730
- Let it go! You should be ashamed of yourself!

581
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,930
...Relax. Keep your cool!

582
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,620
- Look at this. Watch.

583
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,770
- I'll teach him.

584
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,050
- I know what I have to do.

585
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:06,290
- I don't want to.
- Listen.

586
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:08,920
...Listen, listen, let me tell you something!

587
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,810
...her brother Dadan...
is a common war criminal.

588
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:14,140
...he almost killed me. He'll exterminate our family.

589
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:17,610
He'll drink our blood.
- But she's a midget.

590
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:21,210
- O mirror, the dead with the dead...
- He'll be drinking out blood!

591
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,210
- ...the living with the living,
the children with their father.

592
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,090
- For two months. Then you get a divorce.
- Still no!

593
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,600
- ...the dead with the dead...

594
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:34,650
- I said no and that's it!

595
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,890
...leave me be!

596
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:55,010
- I'll prevent the marriage in an
elegant manner.

597
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,530
- Zare.

598
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:10,490
- Help me climb up or else I'll beat you up!

599
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,540
- Zare!

600
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,970
...damn you stupid kid!

601
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:34,010
- Where is he?

602
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:35,970
- Who?
- Your grandson.

603
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,840
- Aye, you keep sitting here and playing!

604
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:45,770
...don't even be bothered by Dadan making mince meat out of all of us.

605
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,130
- Where is my son?
- I don't know. Couldn't care less.

606
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,650
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

607
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,250
- Get out of there.

608
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,490
...out! Hiding is futile.

609
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,970
...today's his wedding.

610
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:19,210
...you disgraceful lot!

611
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:28,810
- The dead with the dead,
the living with the living...children with their father...

612
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,260
...the dead with the dead,
the living with the living...children with their father...

613
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,770
- Granddad.

614
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,810
- He's not breathing.

615
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,010
- Grandpa is dead.

616
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:19,570
- Did you hear me?!

617
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,970
- The old man's dead!

618
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,320
...I said, grandpa is dead.

619
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,490
- His heart stopped beating.

620
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,490
- Dead?

621
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,610
...did you have to die on the day your
grandson marries?

622
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,490
The day he marries...

623
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:07,010
- Grandpa wanted to saved me...

624
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:11,330
...we'll flee together after the mourning ends.
I'll take you with me. Just you and I.

625
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:16,330
- Ah now I'll need to get a new costume, shoes,
a butterfly-tie...

626
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:19,210
...wreaths of flowers, candles...and so on...
- It's ok...

627
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:27,010
- Definitively dead.

628
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:29,010
- It's okay...cry...

629
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:44,640
- Ah it's you, Matko, you womaniser.

630
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,210
...you're early. Eight o'clock, you said.

631
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,490
...where's the son in law?

632
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,050
- I need to speak with you immediately!

633
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,370
...it's urgent.
I've got to talk to you in private.

634
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:02,610
- Hope it's not bad news! Today I only want to hear good news.

635
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,450
- I'm listening.

636
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,770
- My father is dead.

637
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:30,170
- Really?
- Really.

638
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:32,970
- My condolences.
- What can I do?

639
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:37,250
...a wedding and a funeral don't
get along well.

640
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,020
- You're right. How about he dies in three days?

641
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:44,770
- Three days? But he died this morning.

642
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:48,090
- Who says so? Who knows?

643
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,970
- I know it. Zare...

644
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:55,370
...I came straight to you to tell you!
We'll have to mourn for forty days.

645
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:58,610
- I'll mourn with you... in three days.

646
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,850
...you're a wise man.

647
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,740
...you're not postponing the wedding.

648
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,780
- We'll have to!

649
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:14,500
- You're mad? Should my father turn in his grave? That's what you want?

650
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,090
- Of course not Dadan.

651
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,750
- Don't tell anyone about the old man.

652
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,590
...it doesn't matter to him if he dies on
Wednesday or Friday.

653
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,610
...death's forever.

654
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:30,050
...it doesn't matter when it begins.

655
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:33,250
...did you hear anything?
- Nope.

656
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:36,170
- We didn't hear anything.
- No.

657
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,610
- Me neither.

658
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:42,290
...get the guests
and come pick up the bride.

659
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,730
- As you like, Dadan.
- Cheers.

660
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:54,780
- He's not impressed.
- What?

661
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:01,490
- Even if he kills us and places us dead at
the dinner table, the wedding will continue!

662
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,050
- I won't do. No way.

663
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:06,490
- Don't be daft. He'll rip my head off!

664
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,530
...take this...

665
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:13,570
...for your soul, daddy.

666
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:18,410
...take his legs. We are going to the attic.

667
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,040
...turn him aside.

668
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:34,810
...bring up some ice.

669
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:37,010
...hurry up!

670
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,330
...quick!

671
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,570
...don't do this to me.
You don't need money anymore.

672
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:24,450
...put his legs on the chair.

673
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:30,450
- Get the grandchildren of Grga Pitic here!

674
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:34,970
- I left six messages.
They don't answer.

675
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,410
...who knows where they are?

676
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:40,650
...daddy, forgive me.

677
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,370
- Hold it above the bride.
- I don't want to.

678
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:16,180
- Hold it above her head.
- I said no!

679
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:51,090
- Get away you.

680
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:12,050
- Take the child, it will bring you luck.

681
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,850
- My dear ones...This is the most beautiful day...

682
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,570
...of your whole life.

683
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:24,410
...a unique day...

684
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,650
...to say so.

685
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,970
...because this is the day of your lives.

686
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:36,250
...answer now in front of the witnesses...

687
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,450
...the following questions.

688
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:41,650
...but be brief. And quick.

689
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,610
...just yes or no.

690
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,770
- Do you...

691
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,600
...Zare Destanov do you...

692
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:58,490
...out of free will...

693
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:01,970
...take Afrodita Karambolis to be your wife?

694
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:10,010
Karambolo.

695
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:15,930
- Say yes.

696
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:17,650
- Yes.

697
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:22,010
- And you, Afrodita...

698
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:26,850
...lovely beauty and so sweet...

699
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:34,010
...do you take Zare Destanov to
be your husband out of free will?

700
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,570
- She said 'of course yes'

701
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:41,490
- Let her say it. Yes or no.

702
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,010
- I want an answer.
- Yes.

703
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,770
- So yes it is.

704
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:50,130
...I don't see any legal objection.

705
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:54,050
...I now declare you man and wife...

706
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,410
...in my presence...

707
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:02,010
...and in the presence of this crowd.

708
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:05,810
- Hurry up, make sure everything's okay.

709
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,490
- I don't want to.

710
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:11,040
- You know my hands can be very swift.

711
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:15,650
...thunder in one hand,
lightning in the other.

712
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,810
- Please sign this.

713
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,820
- I cannot wait on his wedding.

714
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,730
- Why do you care about his wedding?

715
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:28,450
- As the community's administrative officer...

716
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,410
...I declare married:

717
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:33,960
...Zare Destanov and Afrodita Karambolis.

718
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:37,170
- Do you cry for him?
- Yes.

719
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:39,770
- Then cry.

720
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,810
...cry, baby, cry.

721
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:51,730
- I will buy you a convertible
and half the ocean!

722
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:54,440
...and three houses
bigger than America

723
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:58,130
...little girl,
you have stolen my heart

724
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:01,210
...and if you were mine,
you would live like a queen,

725
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:04,650
...at daytime a queen
and at nightime an empress.

726
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,980
- Come on!

727
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:23,980
- Come on, hands up everyone!

728
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,090
- Way to go, Dadan.

729
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,250
...a real businessman and patriot.

730
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:05,970
- Come and dance, little sister.

731
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:07,850
- Fuck off.

732
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:13,050
- Ok, let her go.

733
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:19,650
- Respect your brother in law, a sensible man.

734
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,130
- Dance with your brother, it's tradition.

735
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,130
- I don't want to.

736
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:29,890
- Fine. It's your wedding.

737
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:31,970
...freedom.

738
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:39,730
- Daddy, I hope you see this.

739
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:43,090
- Let's see who has spent the most on gifts.

740
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:49,450
...a portable record player...

741
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:53,480
...from Nada Adzovic.

742
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:11,610
...Zudija Adzovic donates
a vacuum cleaner.

743
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,690
...Spaho Ahmetovic, pots and pans.

744
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:30,650
- Keep going, pal!

745
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,530
- Something's amiss. I am going to look how daddy is doing.

746
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:25,770
...stay here and please
don't get us in trouble.

747
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:37,210
- Nebojsa Palanovic
donates this ugly thing.

748
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:40,170
- Don't show the people you are crying.

749
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,970
- Promise you're not going to do anything stupid.

750
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:05,680
- I am a
pit bull-terrier.

751
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,770
- I am going to give new ice to daddy.

752
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:28,570
- You live poorly. Repair your roof.

753
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:35,890
- There is nothing wrong with the roof.

754
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:38,600
- It's daddy who needs to be repaired.

755
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:56,690
- Wipe your nose.

756
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:04,490
...do you want to marry someone you don't love?

757
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,010
- No.

758
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:09,010
- Neither do I.

759
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,690
- Do you love her?
- Yes.

760
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:26,170
- Then help me run away.

761
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:29,810
- What?
- Help me escape.

762
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,930
- There is a big shutter near the table...

763
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,130
...on the floor...

764
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:42,290
...turn left at the oil-barrels.

765
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:27,320
- Ahh, what a joyful moment, fuck me!

766
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:36,730
- For once be honest with me, daddy.

767
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:39,850
...where is your money from the factory sale?

768
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:43,090
- Safet.

769
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:46,170
...bring grenades!

770
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:52,370
- What? Grenades?

771
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:24,280
- But why? Your husband can't see it.
- He'll rip your heart out if he learns about it.

772
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:03,780
- You, stop wandering around, come and dance instead!

773
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:51,410
- Where is the bride?
- Hell I know! Ask the businessman and patriot.

774
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,090
- Everybody listen.

775
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,890
...the bride is gone!

776
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,650
- Chief, the bride is gone!

777
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:09,610
- Chief, your sister is gone.

778
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:15,340
- What sort of a husband are you, letting your wife run away?
- Bugger off!

779
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,600
- My dress!

780
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,700
- Hey, what's happening?!

781
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,810
- My sister...

782
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:04,930
- Stop this, sister!

783
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,210
...don't worry.

784
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,010
...your brother will not abandon you.

785
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,770
...I will find the guilty one.

786
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:20,050
- How could she remove her dress and escape?
- Dunno.

787
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:23,920
- You let your wife escape?!

788
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:27,050
...you son of a bitch!

789
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,010
...what have you done?

790
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:36,610
- Has <i>your </i>sister escaped?
- No, yours.

791
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:39,160
- Then why the fuck are crying?
Get fucking lost.

792
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:43,450
- Stupid junkies.

793
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:59,370
- What is she doing here, eh?

794
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,210
- Searching for smurfette.

795
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,610
- How did you call her?

796
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:06,690
- Smurfette.

797
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:10,290
- Shame on you.

798
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,530
- You don't call my sister smurfette.

799
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:15,450
...understood?

800
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:18,290
...do you even know who I am?

801
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,210
- Leave her be, she knows nothing!

802
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:23,090
...it's not her fault,
she doesn't know anything.

803
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,810
- She does know something.

804
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:29,450
- Stop it. Everybody calls her
ladybird or smurfette.

805
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:33,090
- Grandfather!

806
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:36,920
- Grandfather? You are unrealistic, boy.

807
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,690
- Grandfather!

808
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:42,520
- Let him go, he doesn't know anything!

809
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:46,170
- Don't bother your grandfather, he is dead.

810
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:54,690
- Leave him, he doesn't know anything.

811
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:57,450
- Where is she?
- My ear.

812
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:00,290
- Let go of him, bastard.

813
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:03,850
- Where is she? She hasn't vaporised.
- Let him go. Now!

814
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:13,090
- Tell me, suckers. Or I will kill you.

815
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:16,490
...you're not telling me where she'd gone?

816
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,850
- Shall I shoot him?
- Later. Later!

817
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,250
- Dadan.

818
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:47,600
- What are you doing here?
- Dadan, I am stuck.

819
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:55,930
...I have important news.

820
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:01,810
...my balls are stuck.

821
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,960
- Shame on you. Repair that roof.

822
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:19,170
- Who cares? I have seen the bride.

823
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:21,210
- Where?
- At the Dead Tree.

824
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:23,170
- Safet.

825
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:28,170
- Not there, friend. This way, she came this way!

826
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:31,290
...this way!

827
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:53,450
- Granddad, do you hear me?

828
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:55,770
- Yes, what's the matter?

829
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:58,170
- We should turn back.

830
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:01,370
- We need some things sorted!

831
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:04,250
- You can visit his grave another time.

832
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,610
- No, now.
Who knows how long I will live.

833
01:34:07,860 --> 01:34:11,010
- You'll get a stroke in this heat, Granddad!

834
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,170
...it's a hundred degrees out there...

835
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:16,850
- I'll live, plus, Zarija deserves to my visit.

836
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:19,370
- Ok then.

837
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:22,410
...I said it for your own good.

838
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:31,090
- Afrodita.

839
01:34:32,860 --> 01:34:34,410
- Sister.

840
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,850
...I will not harm you.

841
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:48,730
- There she is.

842
01:34:50,820 --> 01:34:52,450
- My sister.

843
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:04,890
- All ends well.

844
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:30,210
- She is not here.

845
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,170
- Maybe she is in the woods.

846
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:40,960
- What a shame the bride runs
away from her own wedding.

847
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:44,760
...everybody will talk about it for years.

848
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,260
...it's my shame that she'd gotten away.

849
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:49,970
- I will find her. The wedding will continue.

850
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:51,770
- Chief, it's a shoe.

851
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:58,450
- Sister!

852
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,450
- I will kill you!

853
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,170
- Wakey, wakey! We're stuck!

854
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:25,650
...wake up! An earthquake. Earthquake!

855
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:33,400
- Why am I listening to you in the first place?
We always get lost when I listen to you!

856
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:36,250
...where did you get that stupid map?

857
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:40,050
- Hey, Dad, you're asleep or what?

858
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,210
...I think we're lost...

859
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:46,530
...what's going on with you?

860
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:04,890
...they're gone!

861
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:26,530
- This is my destiny!

862
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:28,770
- Why destiny?

863
01:38:29,420 --> 01:38:32,930
- All this. I will still marry you.

864
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:34,570
- Yes.

865
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:38,570
- Who could have thought Ladybird
would be so brave?

866
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:42,090
...I don't know anyone daring to go up against Dadan...

867
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:44,250
- She is indeed brave.

868
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:49,450
- I am so afraid.

869
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:55,530
- Of what? We'll drown this filthy son of a bitch in his own shit!

870
01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:06,130
- Congratulations, son. Brilliant idea.

871
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:39,250
- I thought I saw the devil itself.

872
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:44,610
...but it's destiny.

873
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:02,050
- And my other shoe?

874
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:06,610
- We will find it.
But this is one hundred percent destiny!

875
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:08,410
- Don't be silly.

876
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:13,130
- I was looking for someone, just like you...that matches my taste!

877
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:14,810
- Me too.

878
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:18,930
- I looked and looked, found
her when I least expect it.

879
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:20,570
- Me too.

880
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:27,330
- Let's introduce ourselves. I am Grga.

881
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:33,010
- Me too. I mean, I am
Afrodita Karambolo. Ladybird.

882
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:35,890
- We must celebrate,
if you agree.

883
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:38,370
- My sister...
- Quiet.

884
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:47,770
- Hey, what are you doing, stop it, stop it, hey!

885
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:56,410
...it's a misunderstanding!

886
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:02,330
...you silly sod, stop shooting like that.
You know how much money is at stake?

887
01:42:02,540 --> 01:42:05,930
- Excuse me. If the lady has any debts
I will pay them.

888
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:18,770
- What the fuck you're waiting for? Take action!

889
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:27,170
- Grga.

890
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:30,890
- Give me back my sister.

891
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:32,930
- I'll shoot holes in you, filth!

892
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:36,090
- Fuck off. Come here, sis.

893
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:38,900
- You're a shit driver!

894
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:43,090
...you lost your old man, you lost me...you suck!

895
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:44,610
- Look what I have got.

896
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:47,650
- Don't come any closer
or I will pump you full of lead!

897
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,330
...I swear to God. You think I'm kidding?

898
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:55,850
- Sister in law...

899
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:58,850
- Who are they?
- Put your guns down.

900
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:00,410
- Don't move!

901
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:02,650
- She is my sister. Understand?

902
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:05,460
...and she's fled her own wedding!

903
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:09,250
- Oh well, she's my trouble now
- And he's mine.

904
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:12,330
- Shame on you. And you! Give me back my sister!

905
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:19,050
- She's coming with me. If you are really her brother,
we can come to an agreement.

906
01:43:19,260 --> 01:43:22,170
...I want to marry her immediately.

907
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:27,090
- She just ran away from her wedding.

908
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:32,090
- You can run away from a fake marriage,
but you can't hide from destiny.

909
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:41,170
- Ewww, what a sharpshooter.

910
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:44,720
- Who the fuck is that?

911
01:43:44,980 --> 01:43:46,730
- Drop the guns!

912
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:52,890
- You call this driving, idiot?

913
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:54,930
...Why didn't you take the other road?

914
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:58,210
- Ok, but look what I found.

915
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:04,690
- Very cute.

916
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,730
- Chill out!

917
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:08,850
...this isn't necessary.

918
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:21,610
- How's it going, consignor Grga?

919
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:23,730
- Is it you, worthless piece of shit?

920
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,930
...what are you doing here?

921
01:44:26,180 --> 01:44:28,370
- We were just talking.

922
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:30,530
- Talking about what?

923
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:35,260
...are you here to pay off your debt?

924
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,250
- Do you know each other?

925
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:42,330
- Last time I was in Italy...in 1982...

926
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:45,370
...he was a newbie in my gang.

927
01:44:45,620 --> 01:44:47,490
...the worst kind.

928
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:52,170
...I lost the landfills in Trieste and Udine because of him.

929
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:35,050
- So don't you want to marry her?
- No.

930
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:37,090
- I want her.

931
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:39,650
- A bit later about that one...

932
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:43,010
- Now.
- Be silent when you are speaking to me.

933
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,820
- And you, do you want my grandson?

934
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:47,370
- Yes!

935
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:59,780
- And you do not object to your
sister marrying my grandson?

936
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:02,850
- Of course not, if they love each other.

937
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:06,970
- What the heck's making you unhappy?

938
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:08,930
...what's wrong?

939
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:11,810
...ahh the cement factory...

940
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:17,450
....and the three wagons of petrol he nicked from you...

941
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:19,980
...you'll pay him back, understood?
-Right now!

942
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:22,890
...he will pay at once.
- Of course.

943
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:26,250
- And the wedding must
start immediately.

944
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:31,290
- The wedding can begin.
Music!

945
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:41,250
- What counts, is that love conquers all.

946
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,370
- Cheers!

947
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:47,170
- Has he drank it yet?
- Not yet.

948
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:53,090
- My beautiful sisters.
- I hope there won't be any complications.

949
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:56,170
- You will swim in your own shit.

950
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:04,260
- Do you need anything, uncle Grga?

951
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:09,130
- Have fun, I am going visit
the grave of my friend.

952
01:47:09,460 --> 01:47:10,770
- The grave?

953
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:14,010
- Where is it? Tell me.
- Uncle Grga...

954
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:20,170
...don't you want to drink something first?

955
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:22,530
...a refreshment. Eat something as well.

956
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:26,730
...at this hour there are
vampires in the graveyard.

957
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:30,450
...by the time we get there,
they will be gone.

958
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:32,170
- As you wish.

959
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:36,250
...my servants will bring
you to the graveyard.

960
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:43,650
...but where should the grave be?

961
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:55,410
- Give me the money.

962
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:57,570
- Traitor.

963
01:47:57,820 --> 01:48:00,170
- It was only ethical.

964
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:06,450
...I think we're sorted then.

965
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:09,690
...be jolly. Your sister is happy, so is my son.

966
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:13,010
...like our benefactor, uncle...

967
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:17,570
...What's going on?!

968
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:19,370
- What's the matter?
- Look.

969
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:36,570
- What's the matter with him?

970
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:40,890
- He is dead.

971
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:51,010
- Really dead.

972
01:48:51,260 --> 01:48:54,170
- No. He will die the day after tomorrow,
like your father.

973
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:59,130
...the wedding must continue. I can't
start over a hundred times.

974
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:01,610
- Am I right?
- Completely.

975
01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:04,420
- Shall we put him in the attic?

976
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:16,370
- We told his grandchildren,
we were taking him to the graveyard.

977
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:20,490
- What about the registrar?
- What registrar?

978
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:24,890
- He must cancel the first wedding
and perform the second wedding.

979
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:28,490
- Don't worry,
I thought you were asking it in relation to the old man.

980
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:32,930
- Chill out!

981
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:10,090
- Goddammit...
- Eat your shit.

982
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:11,730
- Two sixes.

983
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:17,890
- A bit of refreshments...

984
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:23,850
- Duh, that's sweeeet!

985
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:29,130
- The more natural, the sweeter.

986
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:40,290
- Fifty marks.

987
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:18,450
- Look, Dadan...

988
01:51:20,100 --> 01:51:23,050
...500 horns at 5 marks is 2500 marks.

989
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:26,170
...I know someone in Düsseldorf who'll buy the whole lot.

990
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:30,650
- Are you crazy?
Do you want to stuff those horns?

991
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:33,570
- Wait, Dadan.

992
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:36,090
...be a gentleman.

993
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:41,810
...my stake is the factory.

994
01:51:42,060 --> 01:51:45,730
- You have lost that one already.
Look, you have signed this.

995
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:48,540
- Ok, I still have a house.

996
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:52,130
- You have lost that one too, idiot.

997
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:57,290
- But you do have...

998
01:51:59,580 --> 01:52:01,530
...a nice golden tooth.

999
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:06,680
...that will be the stake. 500 marks, ok?

1000
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:21,770
- What's with the ice?

1001
01:52:24,180 --> 01:52:26,610
- Get lost.
- What's going on?

1002
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:28,570
- Damned black cat.

1003
01:52:32,980 --> 01:52:36,930
- I am soaked. She has pissed on me.

1004
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:38,490
- Brother.

1005
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:47,250
- You're alive?
- Aren't we dead?
- I'm not.

1006
01:52:47,500 --> 01:52:49,250
- I was told you were dead.

1007
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:52,650
- They have lied to you.
I am alive.

1008
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:04,290
- Daddy. I am glad you are alive...again.

1009
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:06,330
- Of course you are...

1010
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:09,610
...dead cows can't be milked!

1011
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,410
- Granddad!

1012
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:16,450
- Your father is alive.

1013
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:25,210
- I will now explain to you
of the laws regarding...

1014
01:53:25,460 --> 01:53:28,250
...the holy matremony...

1015
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:31,880
...and the responsibility of marriage.

1016
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:35,250
...I wish everything will be beautiful for you...

1017
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:40,610
...may it last a life long...

1018
01:53:40,860 --> 01:53:43,450
...and enjoy each others company.

1019
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:47,930
...think of it as this...what happens today...

1020
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:53,370
...is a prelude to fulfilling the most important
and beautiful tasks in life.

1021
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:59,300
- It's kicking in...

1022
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:05,050
- Be jealous, not with each other,
but on your marriage.

1023
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:10,730
...honor it and protect it
against all evil.

1024
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:14,490
- Consider it...

1025
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:19,290
- When you died,
I decided to leave.

1026
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:21,490
- What has fallen?

1027
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:26,010
- Very wise. There is no sun here.

1028
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:29,850
- Forget your glasses. Hurry up.

1029
01:54:30,060 --> 01:54:31,690
- Agreed?

1030
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:34,050
- I agree. But don't tell that to anyone.

1031
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:37,170
- I have been drinking
on the funeral, just now.

1032
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:39,450
- Don't forget the accordion.

1033
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:43,890
...in it you will find enough,
to live happy.

1034
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:49,370
- Shit, I got the death certificate
instead of the wedding certificate.

1035
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:51,290
- Are you crazy? Junkie.

1036
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:53,370
- My reputation...

1037
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:56,770
...shall I call the police?

1038
01:54:57,340 --> 01:54:58,650
- Here.

1039
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:00,890
...everything is allright.

1040
01:55:01,180 --> 01:55:04,770
...the signatures please.
First the ladies, then the men.

1041
01:55:05,020 --> 01:55:08,410
- The ladies don't marry each
other, stupid fool.

1042
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:10,450
- He knows his job, chill out!

1043
01:55:11,300 --> 01:55:13,730
- Keep making sure it's all legal!

1044
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:19,970
- Do you, Afrodita Karambolo...

1045
01:55:20,220 --> 01:55:22,210
...take to be your husband...

1046
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:24,010
...Grga Pitic junior?

1047
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:25,570
- Yes.

1048
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:31,650
- Do you, Grga Pitic junior...

1049
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:35,050
...take to be your wife
Afrodita Karambolo?

1050
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:36,610
- Yes.

1051
01:55:39,380 --> 01:55:42,130
- Sign the register.

1052
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:45,850
...according to the law you
are now husband and wife.

1053
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:49,290
...congragulations!

1054
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,620
- Swim, you bastard!

1055
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,660
- Brother!

1056
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:14,010
- Sister! Someone, help me!
Give me your hand!

1057
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:17,090
- I can't work like this.

1058
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:23,570
- There it is.

1059
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:25,330
- It's amazing.

1060
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:26,890
- Quickly!

1061
01:56:27,140 --> 01:56:31,050
- We are not married yet.
- We will do it on the way.

1062
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:43,570
- Mr. Dadan, you're in deep trouble.

1063
01:56:45,620 --> 01:56:49,780
- You always spoil everything.
We must continue the ceremony.

1064
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:51,780
- I haven't had this much fun for a long while!

1065
01:56:57,140 --> 01:57:00,570
- I can't work like that.
- Yes you can.

1066
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:02,810
- It can't just be done. It's a ceremony!

1067
01:57:07,570 --> 01:57:09,570
...hey, I'm an official!

1068
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:13,330
- We are missing the boat. Get going!

1069
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:18,050
- The boy has guts.
- Granddad's blood.

1070
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:20,570
- Zare, my grandson.

1071
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:27,450
- You're just a kid, what do you want from me?

1072
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:30,290
- I want you to marry us.

1073
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:32,330
- Don't forget the accordion.

1074
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:50,050
- Come back, we need to finish the ceremony!

1075
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:55,050
- Sit down!

1076
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:58,410
- You don't have any witnesses.
- Yes we do!

1077
01:57:58,660 --> 01:58:00,930
- Who?
- The cats.

1078
01:58:07,340 --> 01:58:10,650
- Oi, wait for me!

1079
01:58:10,900 --> 01:58:14,600
- You stink, boss.
- I'll fuck your mothers!

1080
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:33,340
- Ida, will you take Zare as your husband?

1081
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:37,130
- Yes. 
- Do you, Zare Destanov, take her
to be your wife...

1082
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:38,690
- Of course!

1083
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:42,450
- Children...

1084
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:45,290
...have a good journey!

1085
01:58:45,290 --> 01:58:47,290
- Good bye granddad!

1086
01:58:50,420 --> 01:58:54,730
- My dear friend...Shall we drink to it
like it is tradition?

1087
01:59:19,460 --> 01:59:21,730
- Grandmother!

1088
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:32,920
- You have fooled me, daddy!

1089
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:45,570
- Don't forget about your loving father!

1090
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:54,460
- It's all chaos!!

1091
02:00:02,820 --> 02:00:04,450
- Nice stuff.

1092
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:08,530
- Thanks, daddy,
for everything you have done for me.

1093
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:11,450
- My soul is on fire.
