00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:57,521
and his Advanced Swearing badge.

160
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:01,480
- Shit off, you hairy dog's cock.
- Respect.

161
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:06,078
Since you has got your fifth badge,
you has earned your second slit.

162
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,603
Hopefully one day
you'll get to be Tyrone's level.

163
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:14,526
If you gets any better,
we'll have to start doing your pubes.

164
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:19,004
- I don't have any.
- Well, I is got millions.

165
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:23,086
Now, remember -
without realness, we is nothing.

166
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:25,880
So, posse, keep it real!

167
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:27,918
(All chant) Keep it real!

168
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:34,438
On the streets, your homie
would take a cap in his ass for you.

169
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:39,322
So let's start with
a very basic trust exercise.

170
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:43,883
- One, two, three.
- Ali, can I have a word?

171
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:48,079
- Sure.
- It's about the centre.

172
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:51,403
I know how much these classes
mean to you

173
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:55,156
- and how much the kids enjoy them.
- (Groaning)

174
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:58,438
But the government's withdrawn
our funding.

175
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:02,446
They're closing down
the John Nike Leisure Centre.

176
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:09,444
You what? How is these kids meant
to make it out of the ghetto now?

177
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:13,116
- They'll have to go somewhere else.
- Somewhere else?

178
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:16,921
Do you know what this centre
means to them? And to me?

179
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:20,755
This is the spiritual home
of the West Staines Massiv.

180
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,605
This is like what Mecca is
to the Jews.

181
00:12:23,647 --> 00:12:26,605
It's like what Kentucky is
to chickens.

182
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:31,277
And it was here when me
first felt me Julie's... (Whistles)

183
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:35,876
Ali, there's nothing you can do.

184
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:39,283
Now, you better go and tell the kids.

185
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:01,322
I ain't never gonna let them
close us down.

186
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,801
Keep it real, yeah?

187
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:09,557
(Woman) 'Dinner with
the Belgian prime minister at eight.

188
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:13,202
'And the Deputy Prime Minister
wishes to speak to you.'

189
00:13:13,247 --> 00:13:17,081
- Has he heard the poll results yet?
- Yes, I wish I hadn't.

190
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:19,163
Gallup puts us 22 points behind.

191
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:21,562
- And MORI?
- 23 points behind.

192
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:24,405
The youth vote's
deserting us in droves.

193
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:26,836
Focus groups say we're out of touch.

194
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:28,764
- We are.
- Don't be silly.

195
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,798
Will we lose this by-election?

196
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:35,045
We haven't lost Staines in 20 years
and we're not about to start.

197
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,884
We just have an image problem.

198
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:40,636
We have to find a candidate
who will improve that image.

199
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:42,757
Somebody young.

200
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,401
- Somebody ethnic.
- Somebody in touch.

201
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,517
- Exactly.
- You're right.

202
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:53,800
We need an intellectually superior
candidate to guarantee us victory.

203
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:56,637
- Easy now, Mrs Hugh.
- Booyakasha.

204
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:59,918
- Is me Julie about?
- She's upstairs.

205
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:03,926
Hello, baby, I's been missing you
so much today.

206
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:08,404
You is looking so fine. All I want
to do is pull your panties down...

207
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,199
Ali.

208
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:13,080
- Hello, me Julie.
- Stop feeling up Nina.

209
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:16,802
- I got confused.
- You're never confused with Tracey.

210
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:20,362
- Hello, Ali.
- Hello.

211
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:22,398
You know you is me only bitch.

212
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:24,677
Ho. Lady?

213
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:28,197
When me close me eyes,
you is the only girl me think about.

214
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:30,807
# Gal flex, time to have sex

215
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,643
# Jump in my Lex, steam a blunt,
pop a vex

216
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,757
# Now you know that my style
is rated XX... #

217
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:40,039
- Ali, open your eyes.
- Sorry, there was something in them.

218
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,045
Because there's these fleas
going around,

219
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:47,160
two of them, coming in again
and they're in me eyes!

220
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:49,641
# Open up dem legs a-wider... #

221
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:52,804
You've been a very bad boy
and you need to be punished.

222
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:55,805
- Are you a bad boy?
- Yes, I am.

223
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:58,236
My skin is so dry.

224
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:01,757
So for being a bad boy,
I want you to rub oil into me,

225
00:15:01,807 --> 00:15:05,686
paying special attention
to my breasts and my batty crease.

226
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,366
OK, I will do that.

227
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,639
But first, I want you to
take your hat off, you naughty boy.

228
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:14,678
But me never take me hat off.

229
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:17,195
You take that off
and I'll take these off.

230
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,317
OK.

231
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,721
Now I'm going to milk you.

232
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,520
- (Julie) 'Ali.'
- Give me one more sec.

233
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,843
- Behave, Alistair.
- J-Lo.

234
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,117
They is closing down the centre.

235
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:40,399
I is gonna go on hunger strike
until they save it...or until I die.

236
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:45,441
So just in case I do join Tupac
and Biggie in that ghetto in the sky,

237
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,763
I's come here to bone you
one last time.

238
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:51,480
Mr Johnson might have something
to say about that.

239
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:54,325
- Can I watch?
- I got not problem with that.

240
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,039
Ali!

241
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:58,681
Don't do nothing stupid, all right?

242
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:08,605
Hear me now.
She ain't really me Julie.

243
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:12,117
In real life I is going out
with someone much fitter.

244
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:15,398
But they do that
to make me more accessible.

245
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:19,759
Which means you girls think I will
knob you, even if you is a minger.

246
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:29,000
OK, you got ten seconds
till you start.

247
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:31,038
(Muffled) More! More!

248
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:35,320
OK, and go.

249
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,676
Mr G, why are you on hunger strike?

250
00:16:37,727 --> 00:16:40,400
(Muffled) In the struggle for...

251
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:46,319
In the struggle for justice,
I is willing to lay down me life.

252
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:50,201
Just like
Martin Luther...Vandross did.

253
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:56,760
Local party chairman Alan Swan
has some names for the by-election.

254
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,799
This is a great honour.
I've always admired...

255
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:04,045
- The names, Swan.
- Right. Well, er...

256
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:09,480
There are three really outstanding
candidates that match your criteria.

257
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:13,566
Top of the list is Andrew Hamilton,
PhD political science,

258
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:16,485
studied PPE at Oxford,
gained a starred first.

259
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:19,041
Have you tried these new
chicken dippers?

260
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:22,716
- They're really good.
- What sauce are you going for?

261
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:24,325
I think it's barbecue.

262
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,437
(Roars and moans)

263
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:34,042
I can't take it!

264
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,282
(Ali roars)

265
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:44,436
Chicken dippers!

266
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:50,005
- Good, we can go home now.
- Oh, nips.

267
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:52,277
I'll get the keys, yeah?

268
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:55,399
Starting again from...now!

269
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:58,644
# Bring it! What? We right here... #

270
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:01,683
No.

271
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:06,686
# We right here,
this is ours and we don't share #

272
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:10,959
- What has we got here, then?
- I is doing a serious protest.

273
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,646
In that case, we'll leave you to it.

274
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:16,326
Oh, thanks.

275
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,676
There was just one thing, though.

276
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:22,359
(All laughing)

277
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:25,080
# ...joint made this year
that'll knock till 2003

278
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:28,164
# Y'all gonna see
that the hottest nigger out there

279
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:31,756
# Was and will be me
# Just like that

280
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,206
# I can go away for a minute

281
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:35,715
# Do some other shit
but bounce right back... #

282
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,837
(Disappointed groan)

283
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:42,483
Grow, Biggie, grow.
I has gotta get a semi lob-on.

284
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:44,643
Jennifer Lopez, Jennifer Lopez.

285
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:51,795
Jennifer Lopez lezzing off with the
big-thighed one in Destiny's Child.

286
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:00,320
Look here now!
Look at my massive beast!

287
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,562
(All screaming)

288
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:05,041
You filthy animal!

289
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:15,558
(lrish accent)
Oh, Shep, this rail is very dirty.

290
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:18,121
It's going to need
a lot of polishing.

291
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,998
(Moaning)

292
00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:23,881
PhD in economics,
three years at Harvard, age 34...

293
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:26,964
Swan? Is there any reason
why there should be

294
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:30,795
an absurdly dressed,
half-naked man chained to a fence

295
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:34,237
being tossed off
by an old, blind council worker?

296
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,759
(Ali moaning)

297
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:42,006
Ignore him. It's the local idiot
making some pathetic protest.

298
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,322
Unchain him and bring him in here.

299
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,881
- But I'm trying to...
- Bring him in, Swan.

300
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:53,365
Straight ahead
at the top of the stairs.

301
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,715
# Freak me, baby
# Yeah, just like that

302
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:01,156
# Freak me, baby
# Come on, come on

303
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:04,085
# Freak me, baby

304
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,925
# Let me lick you up and down

305
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:09,401
# Till you say stop

306
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:13,645
# Let me play with your body, baby

307
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:15,757
# Make you real hot #

308
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:22,879
# Let me do all the tings
you want me to do

309
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:31,403
# Cos tonight, baby,
I wanna get freaky with you #

310
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,680
I'm Kate Hedges, the Deputy
Prime Minister's secretary.

311
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,639
Come in
and you can pull your pants up now.

312
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:50,036
Hello, I'm David Carlton,
the Deputy Prime Minister.

313
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:53,966
Hello.
I is Ali G, the dominating MC.

314
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:56,919
Making bitches touch their punani.

315
00:20:56,967 --> 00:21:00,198
- The number after two, it be...
- Three.

316
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:03,478
Not Ali A, not Ali B,
not Ali C, not Ali D,

317
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:05,119
not Ali...

318
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:08,397
E...

319
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,438
not Ali...

320
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:12,603
(Hums alphabet song)

321
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,319
F...

322
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,198
- but Ali...
- G.

323
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:19,922
Bo! Your rhymes is tight
for a honkey, yes, sir.

324
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:22,401
That's his full name and address.

325
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,517
Tell me, Ali, do you have a job?

326
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:27,320
I is recently gone on the dole.

327
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:30,399
- When?
- Eight years and three months ago.

328
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:33,644
It says here you claim disability.
Are you...?

329
00:21:33,687 --> 00:21:36,997
Yes, I is actually spasticated.

330
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,197
I is got a terrible DJing injury

331
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:42,444
and still ain't got full mobility
in me mixing finger.

332
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:45,399
Fok-chickety-fok-fok-fresh. Ow.

333
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:49,440
Everything down there
is still working. Oh, yes. Yes.

334
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:53,765
Ali, erm...would you sit down?
Please, sit down.

335
00:21:56,927 --> 00:22:01,796
- Would you ever become an MP?
- What for? It's full of pricks.

336
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:05,476
That's a little harsh.
I'm an MP, am I a prick?

337
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:09,361
- Yes.
- Let's try a different angle.

338
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:13,402
Is there nothing
you'd like to change?

339
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:17,235
Me'd wanna save the John Nike
Leisure Centre, obviously.

340
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:20,563
As the MP for Staines,
you could achieve that.

341
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,996
Would you stand in this by-election?

342
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:25,686
Me gotta be honest,
me ain't actually bi.

343
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,718
- Well...
- I mean,

344
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:29,917
obviously I done it with two girls.

345
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:31,958
Well, I seen it on the internet.

346
00:22:32,007 --> 00:22:36,558
But me would never feel completely
comfortable being bummed by a man.

347
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,723
A lot of people say never say ever

348
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:42,555
but me feel strongly that me
exit hole should stay me exit hole

349
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:46,202
and never become me entry hole,
you know what I is saying?

350
00:22:46,247 --> 00:22:48,807
Yes, yes.

351
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:51,680
Well, it's been
a pleasure meeting you.

352
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:54,560
David.

353
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,879
Later, sweetheart.

354
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:16,762
(Kate) David?

355
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:20,720
What are you doing? He was
the biggest idiot I have ever met.

356
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:24,646
- Choose him and we'll never win.
- I know.

357
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:28,441
There'll be a leadership crisis.
The PM will be out.

358
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:31,081
And who could possibly replace him?

359
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:37,440
Ali has two weeks
to lose us 18,000 votes.

360
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:39,637
Let's get him on the campaign trail.

361
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,998
(# Thumping hip-hop)

362
00:23:43,727 --> 00:23:48,278
Easy, rude boy. Me name be Ali G
and me is here representing Staines.

363
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,602
Can me count on your vote?

364
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:52,956
- Definitely not.
- Hairy muff.

365
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:54,520
Seeing as I is here,

366
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:58,196
could me interest you in
a quarter of Moroccan black?

367
00:23:58,247 --> 00:24:00,158
It's well good shit!

368
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:03,517
Dave, it's your turn
to shit through the letterbox.

369
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,037
Our anti-bullying programme
has won lots of praise.

370
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:11,444
Instances of bullying in
this school are at an all-time low.

371
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:15,162
Jonathan used to suffer terribly
from bullies.

372
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:18,085
I ain't surprised. Look at him.

373
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:23,679
Hey, fatty bum bum. Hey, fatty bum
bum. Want another cream cake?

374
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:26,922
Boiiing! Boiiing! Boiiing!

375
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,958
(Laughs)

376
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:31,316
He is well fat, though.

377
00:24:31,367 --> 00:24:36,395
All you motherfuckers,
fuck-fuck-fuck fuckers!

378
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:40,406
Vote for the G, the motherfuckin' G.
Me, the motherfuckin' G.

379
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:43,086
All the bitches in the house say yo.

380
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:50,367
Vote for me
cos me know what you lezzers want.

381
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:55,800
I is a big supporter of your cause
and I is got many of your videos.

382
00:24:55,847 --> 00:25:01,080
If you vote for me, me give you me
pledge to lower taxes on strap-ons.

383
00:25:01,127 --> 00:25:03,118
(Jeering)

384
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:06,045
Why is you getting so eggy?
Is you all on?

385
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:10,365
Ladies and gentlemen, to commemorate
the town hall extension,

386
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:14,286
we're asking all the candidates
to lay down a brick.

387
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:16,557
Ali, would you lay one for us now?

388
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:19,041
- What, here?
- We would be honoured.

389
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:21,203
- In front of everyone?
- Yes.

390
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,081
(Groans of disgust)

391
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,319
Not bad.

392
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,722
This is absolutely vital.

393
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:41,917
10 days ago we were 14 points ahead,

394
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:44,720
with one day to go
we are eight points behind.

395
00:25:44,767 --> 00:25:48,362
Listen. Did you get the manifesto
that I sent to you?

396
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:53,279
- You got a roach?
- Er... For real.

397
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:55,887
(# Reggae)

398
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:03,156
- You got another roach?
- Yeah, for real.

399
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:06,643
(Ali) Yeah.
(Ricky) Wicked.

400
00:26:06,687 --> 00:26:09,247
Yes. It was very helpful.

401
00:26:09,287 --> 00:26:12,518
30 seconds till we're on air.
Come with me.

402
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:16,116
Good luck. Don't hold back.

(# News theme)

404
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:26,437
In the most crucial by-election
of the past decade,

405
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:30,605
we're joined by ex-Environment
Secretary David Griffiths

406
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:32,638
and newcomer Ali G.

407
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:35,645
This debate will help you
make up your mind.

408
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:39,885
Ali, if elected,
what would you do for Staines?

409
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:42,487
Me'd save
the John Nike Leisure Centre.

410
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,995
You can't mean your sole policy

411
00:26:45,047 --> 00:26:50,075
is to save a centre that's barely
used and a terrible drain on funds?

412
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:52,641
What are your other policies?

413
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:56,885
- My other policies?
- Yes, you must have some.

414
00:26:59,647 --> 00:27:01,717
Well...

415
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:07,927
I think it is well important
to reduce inflay-tee-on

416
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:13,166
and also to invest in the nehuss.

417
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:16,997
(Ali) The nahuss.

418
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:19,845
- Oh, the NHS.
- You're reading from my sheet.

419
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:23,846
No, I ain't. I is thought of them
things meself, you copied from me.

420
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:25,798
It wasn't me.

421
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:29,283
Then perhaps you'd tell me
where you stand on the ERM?

422
00:27:29,327 --> 00:27:32,876
No problem. Me thought
their first album was wack.

423
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,758
Me hate all indie music.

424
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:38,925
The voters deserve better, you're
making a mockery of this debate.

425
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:42,481
What? Is you looking in the mirror?

426
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:47,123
You're making it obvious
to the voters what a buffoon you are.

427
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:50,637
Talking about yourself again?
I think so.

428
00:27:50,687 --> 00:27:54,043
You are an embarrassment
to the people of Staines.

429
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:56,885
That is not a nice way
to talk about your mum.

430
00:27:56,927 --> 00:28:01,921
I put it to you that you are
the worst possible candidate

431
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,720
ever put forward
by your miserable party.

432
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,281
Well, I put it to you...

433
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:17,962
that you sucked off a horse.

434
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:19,599
(Gasping)

435
00:28:21,087 --> 00:28:23,965
I did not, er...suck off a horse.

436
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:29,402
I have already dealt with this issue
with the party chairman

437
00:28:29,447 --> 00:28:31,563
and as I explained to him,

438
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:35,316
I was out hunting with a friend

439
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:39,997
and I slipped onto
the end of a horse's phallus,

440
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:45,519
which, unfortunately,
owing to it being the mating season,

441
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:48,161
was aroused.

465
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:23,557
(Ali singing)
# Mr Boombastic, reggae fantastic!

466
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:25,723
# Take it as a dooby-dooby-doogy

467
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:27,644
# Mr Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro-Ro...

468
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:30,804
# Mmmmmmantic! #

469
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:32,883
(Whimpers)

470
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,361
Is it in yet?

471
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:53,923
Big up yourself. Respect.

472
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:56,197
- Big up yourself.
- MP for Staines.

473
00:30:56,247 --> 00:31:00,206
I know you. You was the geezer
that did it with that prossie.

474
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,119
Respect.

475
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:09,284
- Because this government...
- Order! Order!

476
00:31:10,727 --> 00:31:14,879
This government's conduct
of economic policy

477
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:17,646
has not only been incompetent,

478
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:23,239
it has been unscrupulous,
untrustworthy and untruthful.

479
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:27,075
They is dissin' our posse.
I is gonna sort this.

480
00:31:27,127 --> 00:31:30,881
- (Speaker) Order. Order now.
- And look at this!

481
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:36,081
Order! Order! Will the Member
for Staines return to his seat?

482
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:40,166
Will the Member for Staines
return to his seat?!

483
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:44,041
Order! Order in the House!

484
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:51,846
- What is he doing?
- I'm not sure, Prime Minister.

485
00:31:51,887 --> 00:31:54,355
(All shouting)

486
00:31:54,407 --> 00:31:57,956
- For you to come down to me...
- Shhh.

487
00:31:58,007 --> 00:32:01,602
Relax ya batty.

488
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,762
Look at you!

489
00:32:09,807 --> 00:32:13,083
All you ever do all day long
is cuss each other.

490
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:17,086
R-E-S-T-E-C-P.

491
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:22,598
- Do you even know what that spells?
- Restecp?

492
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:29,162
- Yes. Restecp.
- Restecp.

493
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:33,439
How's anyone out there
meant to restecp each other

494
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:39,642
if you lot in here don't even start
restecp-ing one another?

495
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:41,405
Sergeant, eject him.

496
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:45,326
Wanna know how to make this country
better? It's simple. Two words.

497
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:48,359
- Keep it real.
- That's three words.

498
00:32:48,407 --> 00:32:52,366
Don't be a spanner. "lt" ain't
a real word. It's short for "innit".

499
00:32:52,407 --> 00:32:57,003
- Keep it real!
- He is banned from the House.

500
00:32:57,047 --> 00:32:59,038
Is it cos I is black?

501
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:02,079
What in God's name
have you done to me?

502
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:05,437
I want that idiot in my office
with his resignation.

503
00:33:05,487 --> 00:33:06,966
Yes, Prime Minister.

504
00:33:07,007 --> 00:33:09,805
- (Knock on door)
- Come in.

505
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:15,916
- Listen, me know me done wrong.
- Haven't you read the papers?

506
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:28,400
I can't believe it.

507
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:32,237
This dog can play table tennis.

508
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:36,246
- It's the press, they love you.
- But how can he hold the bat?

509
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:39,836
The Deputy Prime Minister and I
were wondering,

510
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:42,799
what if I asked you
to join the Cabinet?

511
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:44,883
No, think about it.

512
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:48,886
Ali joins the Cabinet,
the two of them are publicly aligned.

513
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,760
Ali slips up,
he takes that old prat with him.

514
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:53,399
Why would Ali join?

515
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:57,918
I've told the Prime Minister
to offer to save his leisure centre.

516
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:00,925
- Are you mad? That would...
- Let me finish.

517
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:07,042
Offers to save his leisure centre
if Ali gets him a 20-point poll lead.

518
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:12,081
Now I is in the Cabinet and all,
could I see the red button?

519
00:34:12,127 --> 00:34:14,322
- Can I trust you?
- Yes.

520
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:16,483
All right. Here we are.

521
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:22,238
One touch on that red button
could destroy the whole world.

522
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:25,643
- That is very interesting because...
- No!

523
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:27,484
Fell for it!

524
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:30,837
Ali, please, stand away. Dear me.

525
00:34:30,887 --> 00:34:33,321
- Can't we blow up something?
- No!

526
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:34,766
- Please?
- No.

527
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:37,765
- Somewhere shitty like Wales.
- Ali.

528
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:40,002
Their Prime Minister
called your mum a slag.

529
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:41,958
I am the Prime Minister of Wales!

530
00:34:42,007 --> 00:34:44,521
You shouldn't say that
about your mum.

531
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:49,004
Your first Cabinet meeting is
Thursday. It's about asylum seekers.

532
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:54,205
(Prime Minister) I'm sending you
on a fact-finding mission.

533
00:34:54,247 --> 00:34:59,116
Anyone trying to smuggle
will probably come through here.

534
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:02,204
And it's not just immigrants.
Look at this.

535
00:35:04,127 --> 00:35:08,439
You'll be appalled.
Look at this crap.

536
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:13,117
Marijuana smuggled in from Europe,
South America and the Middle East.

537
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,886
That is terrible. (Tuts)

538
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:19,003
- Is there any skunk?
- Yes.

539
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:22,164
Some scumbag
smuggled in 15 kilos of this.

540
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:25,517
It's the strongest
super skunk ever discovered.

541
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:31,679
Over here are the confiscated
weapons and this is where we keep...

542
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:34,287
(Shouting aggressively)

543
00:35:37,327 --> 00:35:39,636
You must have such a laugh here.

544
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:43,241
- No, we don't.
- Oh.

545
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:47,519
Next we have the mountains
of hardcore pornography,

546
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:50,957
most of it from Germany.
You may want to look away.

547
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:54,283
No. I is got a job to do.

548
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:57,966
(Whimpers)

549
00:35:58,007 --> 00:36:01,079
I know. It makes me feel sick, too.

550
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:05,881
I have to compile me report now,
so if you'd fuck off.

551
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:08,043
Certainly, sir.

552
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:12,399
Westminster will be sending down
experts to help with me research.

553
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:15,405
(Whispering and laughing)

554
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:17,756
Hello. We is experts.

555
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:23,877
(Cheesy music, people moaning)

556
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:28,957
'Sprütze in die Arse!'

557
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:35,719
Ali, tell us,
what did you find out in Dover?

558
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:38,884
Me saw a lot of stuff,
most of it from Germany,

559
00:36:38,927 --> 00:36:42,442
of these blokes going in
through the back door.

560
00:36:42,487 --> 00:36:45,877
He's right.
In Germany, I experienced it myself.

561
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:48,964
- Respect.
- I remember one time

562
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:51,805
there were these
two huge African men

563
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:56,159
who managed to squeeze themselves
into...this tiny box.

564
00:36:57,447 --> 00:37:00,564
- How long was they in there for?
- 15 hours.

565
00:37:00,607 --> 00:37:03,758
- It was incredibly emotional.
- It must've hurt.

566
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:06,844
- It still does.
- Sorry.

567
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:11,756
So, John, what are we going to do
about these asylum seekers?

568
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:15,641
We can't let them all in,
it would cripple the economy.

569
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:17,086
Oooh!

570
00:37:17,127 --> 00:37:20,039
- Yes, Ali?
- Let's think about this.

571
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:23,204
What's the main thing
we ain't got enough of in the UK?

572
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:24,646
- Hospitals.
- No.

573
00:37:24,687 --> 00:37:27,645
- Libraries?
- Behave!

574
00:37:27,687 --> 00:37:30,076
We ain't got enough fit women.

575
00:37:30,127 --> 00:37:32,846
And we's got too many mingers.

576
00:37:32,887 --> 00:37:35,162
No offence, Karen.

577
00:37:35,207 --> 00:37:39,678
So we let in all the fit refugees
and turn away the rank ones.

578
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:41,683
Then we solve both problems.

579
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:45,879
We is knobbing two birds
with one connie.

580
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:49,442
- This is ludicrous.
- What do you think?

581
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:52,684
I think...we should keep it real.

582
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:55,446
Fit.

583
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:57,921
Fit...fit.

584
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:00,964
Wait.

585
00:38:01,007 --> 00:38:02,998
Back to Slovenia.

586
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:10,324
Education standards
are at their lowest for 15 years.

587
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:14,838
That is because kids is learning
stuff that ain't no use to them.

588
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:19,597
Who here has ever used maths?
Or English?

589
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:25,757
Exactly. Let's start
making education relevant.

590
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:31,200
If Kevin buys six ounces
of Jamaican sinsemilla from Fat Tony

591
00:38:31,247 --> 00:38:33,920
for £480 cash in hand,

592
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:37,164
and has to divide it
amongst 11 of his customers,

593
00:38:37,207 --> 00:38:39,675
how much should he charge
for an eighth

594
00:38:39,727 --> 00:38:43,242
so he can make £100 profit
to pay off his child support?

595
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:48,566
The situation in Northern Ireland
is spiralling out of control.

596
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:50,040
Hear me now.

597
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:53,966
The only way you is ever gonna get
Hindus to stop killing Islams...

598
00:38:54,007 --> 00:38:57,920
- Catholics fighting Protestants.
- Whatever.

599
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:03,121
...is to get some really fit woman
to get her babylons out for peace.

600
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,522
- Prime Minister...
- Not you, love.

601
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:11,085
The army is costing the British
taxpayer £4.2 billion a year.

602
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:14,278
How will the government
reduce this figure?

603
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:17,763
We is gonna hire the A-Team.

604
00:39:17,807 --> 00:39:20,367
Her Majesty the Queen.

605
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:26,281
Your Majesty, may I introduce
Ali G, MP for Staines?

606
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:48,725
Hello, cheeky. You is much fitter
than you look on them coins.

607
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:52,282
Next time me put a 50p piece
in me pocket

608
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:56,525
me will feel honoured having
your head so close to me nuts.

609
00:39:56,567 --> 00:40:00,685
Nothing's working, the jobless
figures are at their highest level.

610
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:08,197
The UK has a special relationship
with the US. Do you like Bush?

611
00:40:08,247 --> 00:40:14,595
Me love bush. Me love anything that
gives foliage to the punani area.

612
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:18,396
Would you do a dance for me, please?

613
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:28,082
- Oh, my God.
- Shaven haven. Respect.

614
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:32,917
- 'As Ali G's influence grows...'
- '...a 12-point lead.'

615
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,322
'The Queen says
he's a breath of fresh air.'

616
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:39,883
- 'Ali G mania sweeps the UK.'

- Boss, this is me Julie.
- Lovely.

646

Should we meet our delegates?
President Wattana from Thailand.

647

- It is an honour to meet you.
- Thai, aight? Present.

648

Let's move along. Do forgive me.

649
00:42:59,407 --> 00:43:01,557
This is the Mongolian delegate.

650
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,883
Is you a genuine mong?

651
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:09,205
That is fantastic that you lot
is also being represented here.

Shall we carry on?
Thank you, do forgive me.

656
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,798
They really can do anything.

657

Get off, you batty boy!

Ali, all right. Please forgive me.

662
00:43:37,127 --> 00:43:39,436
You are a cocksucker.

663
00:43:46,447 --> 00:43:48,915
Bonjour.

664
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:51,276
Canapé, sir?

665
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:28,276
Me Julie.

666
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:32,238

(Sobbing)

668
00:44:35,527 --> 00:44:37,563
Hello?

669
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:47,522
What you doing up here? Why not
stay downstairs with that posh girl?

670
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:52,197
- We was talking about politics.
- I ain't interested, just shut up!

671
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:57,164
Well, me won't speak no more.

672
00:45:01,847 --> 00:45:06,398
You really are a prat.
Now, come here.

673
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,761
We can't. This is the PM's bedroom.

674
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:13,879
Well...

675
00:45:15,927 --> 00:45:19,283
Why don't you pretend to be
the Prime Minister?

676
00:45:20,527 --> 00:45:22,438
Cheeky.

677
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,162
(Julie giggles)

678
00:45:26,207 --> 00:45:30,962
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
In advance of tomorrow's summit,

679
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,283
I shall be having private talks
with both parties.

680
00:45:34,327 --> 00:45:38,764
First, President Mwepu,
would you care to join me upstairs?

681
00:45:38,807 --> 00:45:42,243
- A pleasure.
- Thank you.

682
00:45:46,247 --> 00:45:49,284
(Julie moaning, bed springs creaking)

683
00:45:49,327 --> 00:45:52,364
(Banging, chandeliers clinking)

684
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:56,446
(Man moaning)

685
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,886
(Banging and moaning crescendos)

686
00:46:08,087 --> 00:46:11,079
(Crash, then silence)

687
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:17,121
I must say, I enjoyed that.

688
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:20,318
(Prime Minister) So did I.
I'm so glad we thrashed it out.

689
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:23,564
Ladies and gentlemen,
I want everyone here to know

690
00:46:23,607 --> 00:46:27,566
that President Mwepu here
is a very big man.

691
00:46:27,607 --> 00:46:32,635
And I would like you to know that
the Prime Minister was very hard

692
00:46:32,687 --> 00:46:35,155
- but very straight.
- (All gasping)

693
00:46:35,207 --> 00:46:38,165
The President was very much on top
to start off with

694
00:46:38,207 --> 00:46:41,836
but I don't mind telling you,
I was in a deep hole.

695
00:46:41,887 --> 00:46:45,004
- Oh, very deep.
- (Gasping)

696
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:48,164
We had some sticky patches
but I'm delighted to say

697
00:46:48,207 --> 00:46:52,166
- we came together in the end.
- (Gasping)

698
00:46:52,207 --> 00:46:56,200
Yes, I lapped up everything
that you had to offer.

699
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:59,876
Now President Oompeba,
would you care to join me upstairs?

700
00:46:59,927 --> 00:47:02,646
No bloody way.

701
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:04,086
Can I come?

702
00:47:13,527 --> 00:47:16,166
Come on, honey, let's go home.

703
00:47:16,207 --> 00:47:19,165
- I'll cook you up your favourite.
- Angel Delight?

704
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:22,085
Yeah, butterscotch.

705
00:47:22,127 --> 00:47:25,756
(Both) Mmmm. Butterscotch.

706
00:47:25,807 --> 00:47:28,116
This bit is for the girls,

707
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:31,842
to show that me can be
well sensitive.

708
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:35,880
By the way, if any of you bitches
is fit and into doggy,

709
00:47:35,927 --> 00:47:38,725
here is me mobile number.

710
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:42,157
Callers must be over 16.

711
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:44,277
But not by too much.

712
00:47:47,287 --> 00:47:51,963
Me can't. They need me at
the peace conference tomorrow.

713
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:56,398
You what? What about the people
who really need you?

714
00:47:56,447 --> 00:47:59,325
What about Ricky?
What about Dave?

715
00:47:59,367 --> 00:48:01,358
What about me, Ali?

716
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:06,082
Please come back to Staines.

717
00:48:07,727 --> 00:48:13,802
The world is bigger than Staines.
And me gotta save it.

718
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:19,326
You'll have to do it
on your own, then.

719
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:21,722
Me Julie. Me Julie?

720
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:25,683
Let me call you back.

721
00:48:26,887 --> 00:48:30,482
We've gotta get rid of him
before the centre's saved.

722
00:48:30,527 --> 00:48:32,995
- What I thought...
- You thought?!

723
00:48:33,487 --> 00:48:35,717
The US will do everything
in its power

724
00:48:35,767 --> 00:48:39,521
to support Chad in its struggle
against its neighbours.

725
00:48:39,567 --> 00:48:44,004
Russia will not allow this
Western oppression to continue

726
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:47,198
and in order to support
Burkina Faso,

727
00:48:47,247 --> 00:48:52,480
is prepared to utilise
all our military capabilities.

728
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:57,078
- That's outrageous!
- How can you make such a statement?

729
00:48:57,127 --> 00:49:00,244
- Ali, Ali, Ali.
- (Jungle beats from headphones)

730
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:04,200
- Armageddon's breaking out, help.
- Sure, bro.

731
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:06,807
The United States
will not be intimidated.

732
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:10,362
We will meet any show of force
with our full military might!

733
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:13,046
(Angry shouting)

734
00:49:27,687 --> 00:49:29,120
Oi!

735
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:33,479
You know why they is shouting?
They ain't been fed their teas.

736
00:49:33,527 --> 00:49:35,040
Come on, choppy chop.

737
00:49:35,087 --> 00:49:37,840
(Shouting continues)

738
00:49:46,007 --> 00:49:47,998
Moving to a motion,

739
00:49:48,047 --> 00:49:51,357
all those in favour of sending Iran
to the gas station

740
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:55,366
to get some potato chips
and chocolate, raise your hand.

741
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:57,284
For real.

742
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,477
(Giggling)

743
00:49:59,527 --> 00:50:01,085
Oh, bummer.

744
00:50:01,127 --> 00:50:04,199
# Tease me, tease me, tease me,
tease me, baby... #

745
00:50:04,247 --> 00:50:09,367
I'm sorry we invaded you.
It was really uncool.

746
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:12,604
Who cares? It's all in the past.

747
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:15,844
If I was going to be invaded
by anyone,

748
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,878
I am happy it was you.

749
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:23,001
You are really cool.
You have nice clothes.

750
00:50:23,047 --> 00:50:27,996
- You saved my white ass, Ali.
- No problem, bredrin.

751
00:50:28,047 --> 00:50:31,198
Big up the herbal tea, aight?

752
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:32,919
Hey, you, Britain!

753
00:50:36,007 --> 00:50:38,237
Respect.

754
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:40,517
How does he do it?

755
00:50:40,567 --> 00:50:42,842
# ...catchin' a big fish

756
00:50:42,887 --> 00:50:45,765
# Yes, you are on top
of my romance list

757
00:50:45,807 --> 00:50:49,117
# Second to none,
you defeat the favourite

758
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:52,682
# Woman, your love
is like burnin' fire in my soul

759
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:55,878
# Woman, tease me
till me lose control

760
00:50:55,927 --> 00:51:00,079
# Woman, your love is like
burnin' fire in me soul

761
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:03,119
# Woman, tease me
till me lose control

762
00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:06,955
# Tease me, tease me, tease me,
tease me, baby #

763
00:51:08,207 --> 00:51:13,804
We're quite a team, Ali.
Thanks to you we're 22 points ahead.

764
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:18,363
- I'm gonna save your centre.
- Wicked! Bo! Bo! Bo!

765
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:23,765
(Ali) Check out all the Peperami!
(PM) For you - this is your moment.

766
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:26,367
(Shouting)

767
00:51:30,647 --> 00:51:35,357
Will you comment on accusations
that you drugged the world leaders?

768
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:40,397
- You what?
- Our evidence proves you're guilty.

769
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:42,324
Er...

770
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,835
"Our evidence proves you're guilty."

771
00:51:44,887 --> 00:51:48,118
- This is just childish.
- "This is just childish!"

772
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:52,479
By employing this rhetorical tactic

You are the disgraced one.

And this tape proves it.

- No, David.

1064
01:14:16,967 --> 01:14:21,563

it was to create a better world,

integrity and truth.

that vision was lost.

01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:33,365
My dream was tarnished
and instead I discovered greed,

my right-hand man?
