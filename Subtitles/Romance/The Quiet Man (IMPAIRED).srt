1
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:57,715
Well, then... Urrmm, now.

2
00:01:58,516 --> 00:02:00,549
I'll begin at the beginnin'.

3
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:03,753
A fine, soft day in the spring it was

4
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:07,792
when the train pulled into Castletown,
three hours late as usual,

5
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,163
and himself got out.

6
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:14,267
He didn't have the look
of an American tourist at all about him,

7
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:18,473
not a camera on him and, what was worst,
not even a fishing-rod.

8
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:22,078
Castletown?

9
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:32,123
- Castletown?
- Could you tell me the way to Inisfree?

10
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:36,029
Inisfree? Aw, five miles and maybe a half more.

11
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:38,330
- Do you see that road over there?
- Yeah.

12
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:43,171
Don't take that one, it'll do you no good.
Now, the best road to Inisfree, and many...

13
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:48,078
Oh, Inisfree you want. Be savin' your breath,
let me direct the gentleman.

14
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:49,777
Happen to know the way to Knoghenor?

15
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:53,883
If you knew the way there,
would he be asking the way to Inisfree?

16
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,620
There's many knows Knoghenor
that doesn't know Inisfree.

17
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,092
If you'd take the time to study
your country's history, Mr Maloney...

18
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:04,196
- ... you'd be the first to admit it.
- Don't send the poor man there.

19
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:08,603
The fishing is finished there entirely.
Tell me, Yank, what is it that you're after?

20
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:12,405
- Is it trout or salmon?
- All I want is to get to Inisfree.

21
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:15,743
Ah, now you're talking sense.
The best fishing in the country.

22
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:19,449
- True.
- Trout as long as your arm.

23
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:24,255
And salmon! The last one I got,
I expected Jonah to pop out of his mouth.

24
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:27,125
Ah, Inisfree. I'd bring you there myself,

25
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:29,295
only I got to drive the train.

26
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:33,400
Hey, was I tellin' you about that trout
I got two summers before last?

27
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:36,269
- At Inisfree?
- Not at all!

28
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:38,539
At Ballygar, over the other end of the country.

29
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,379
My sister's third young one is living at Inisfree,

30
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,184
and she'd be only too happy
to show you the road.

31
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:51,422
- No, no, if she was here.
- It's Inisfree the man wants to go to.

32
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:55,962
- You see that signpost over there?
- What do you know...

33
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:13,249
Inisfree, this way.

34
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:41,852
I wonder, now, why a man would go to Inisfree.

35
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:10,022
- Six foot six?
- Four and a half.

36
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:31,181
- Cincinnati?
- No, Pittsburgh.

37
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,551
Pi..Pitss...

38
00:05:50,237 --> 00:05:54,009
Don't you remember, Seaneen, and how it was.

39
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:59,885
The road led up past the chapel,
and it wound, and it wound,

40
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:04,454
and there was the field where
Dan Tobin's bull chased you.

41
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:09,862
It was a lovely little house, Seaneen,
and the roses.!

42
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:15,836
Your father used to tease me about them,
but he was that proud of them, too.

43
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:22,145
That's nothin' but a wee humble cottage.

44
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:43,738
That little place across the brook,
that humble cottage. Who owns it now?

45
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:46,442
The widow Tillane. Not that she lives there.

46
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:48,842
- You think she'd sell it?
- I doubt it.

47
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:51,746
Don't bet on it 'cause I'm buyin' it.

48
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,386
Why... why would a Yankee from Pittsburgh
want to buy it?

49
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,658
I'll tell you why, Michaleen Oge Flynn,
young small Michael Flynn,

50
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:03,229
who used to wipe my runny nose
when I was kid.

51
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:07,802
Because I'm Sean Thornton,
and I was born in that little cottage.

52
00:07:08,836 --> 00:07:12,175
And I've come home, and home I'm gonna stay.

53
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:16,444
Does that answer your questions
once and for all, you nosy little man?

54
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:20,917
Seaneen Thornton... The...

55
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:23,454
And look at you now.

56
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:26,892
What do they feed you,
all you men who are in Pittsburgh?

57
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:33,166
Steel, and pig-iron furnaces so hot
a man forgets his fear of hell.

58
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:37,904
When you're hard enough,
tough enough... other things.

59
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:42,377
Other things, Michaleen.

60
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:04,605
Now then, here comes myself,
that's me there, walking.

61
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:11,347
That tall, saintly-looking man.
Peter Lonergan, parish priest.

62
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:15,118
Good day, Father. Sean, this is Father Lonergan.

63
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:20,159
Father, would you believe it?
This is Sean Thornton,

64
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:23,564
born right here in Inisfree, home from America.

65
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:26,699
- Hello, Father.
- Ah, yes.

66
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,502
I knew your people, Sean.

67
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:35,845
Your grandfather...
He died in Australia, in a penal colony.

68
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:39,482
And your father, he was a good man too.

69
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:43,221
Bad accident, that. And your mother?

70
00:08:43,421 --> 00:08:46,392
She's dead. America, when I was twelve.

71
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:52,498
I'll remember her in the mass tomorrow.
You'll be there, seven o'clock.

72
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,600
- Sure, I will.
- Good.

73
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,906
Sean, I'd like to have a little word
with Michaleen here.

74
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:00,742
- Sure thing, Father.
- It'll only take a minute.

75
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:04,147
- It's a little matter...
- Take your time. I'll be up ahead.

76
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,762
(MICHALEEN): Sean!

77
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:21,744
Hey, is that real?. She couldn't be.

78
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:27,416
Uh, nonsense, man. It's only a mirage
brought on by your terrible thirst.

79
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:30,353
Come up, Napoleon.

80
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:27,926
Over here we pronounce it "Co-han".

81
00:12:38,214 --> 00:12:39,715
Good morning.

82
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:06,115
None of that now.
It's a bold, sinful man you are, Sean Thornton.

83
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:09,921
Who told you to playing patty fingers
in the Holy Water?

84
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,324
- Just being polite, that's all.
- What is this?

85
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,492
Maybe you don't know
it's a privilege only for courting couples,

86
00:13:15,692 --> 00:13:18,129
and then only when the banns have been read.

87
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:23,103
And Mary Kate Danaher
dippin' her fingers in as neat as you please.

88
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,742
- What did you say her name was?
- Mary Kate Danaher.

89
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:30,012
And don't be getting any notions in your head.

90
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:33,784
- Mary Kate...
- Forget it, Sean, forget it.

91
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:36,787
- Put it out of your mind.
- Why? What's the matter?

92
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:40,123
- She isn't married or anything?
- Married? That one?

93
00:13:40,357 --> 00:13:43,628
Not likely. And her
with her freckles and her temper.

94
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:47,433
Oh, that red head of hers is no lie.

95
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:51,271
Still, a man might put up with that
but not with her lack of a fortune.

96
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:07,391
The wealthiest woman in Inisfree
was the widow Tillane.

97
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:10,028
She had neither chick nor child, poor soul,

98
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:14,067
but she was well-respected
and good to the poor.

99
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:17,805
- So you were born there, is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:21,209
All Thorntons were born there,
seven generations.

101
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,880
I see. And what is your thought, Mr Thornton,

102
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,151
are you planning to turn
White O' Mornin' into a national shrine?

103
00:14:29,352 --> 00:14:32,723
Perhaps charge tuppence a visit
for a guided tour

104
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:38,197
through the cottage where the Thorntons
were born. Are you a man of such eminence?

105
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,132
No, not exactly.

106
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:46,241
My own family has been in Ireland since
the Normans came hundreds of years ago,

107
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:51,112
but we've seen no reason to establish
monuments or memorials...

108
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:55,451
Look, Mrs Tillane, I'm not talking about
memorials or monuments.

109
00:14:55,652 --> 00:15:00,625
Ever since I was a kid
living in a shack near the slag heaps,

110
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:04,964
my mother has told me about
Inisfree and White O' Mornin'.

111
00:15:05,164 --> 00:15:09,437
Inisfree has become
another word for heaven to me.

112
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:14,341
When I quit the... When I decided to come here,
it was with one thought in mind.

113
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:17,378
Inisfree is far from being a heaven, Mr Thornton.

114
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:21,351
Ma'am, Mr Red Will Danaher
wishes to be announced,

115
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:24,455
I mean, Squire Danaher.

116
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,624
Watch your muddy boots!

117
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,402
- Mrs Tillane.
- Mr Thornton, from America.

118
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,569
- Aw!
- Boo.

119
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,308
It's him I'm here about, Mrs Tillane.

120
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:44,079
- (WILL): Is it true?
- Is what true?

121
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,785
That behind me back, he's trying to steal
White O' Mornin' right from under me nose?

122
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,989
And what concern of yours is this, Will Danaher?

123
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:55,561
Concern? Concern enough.

124
00:15:56,262 --> 00:15:58,965
Haven't I made you a fair offer
for that same piece of land?

125
00:15:59,165 --> 00:16:03,636
- And mine, lying right next to yours?
- You may keep your offers.

126
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:08,876
- Oh, so it's true. You sold it!
- No, I have not.

127
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:17,154
Oh, I knew it was a dirty lie
the very minute I heard it!

128
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,891
Sure, I said to him,

129
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:24,064
"Paggy McFarland, I won't believe
that Sarah'd be selling White O' Mornin'."

130
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:28,134
(WILL): Why, it would be like building a fence
between your land and mine.

131
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:33,975
"And for a stranger to move in", says I.
"What would she be doing that for?"

132
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:36,879
And us so close to an understanding,
you might say.

133
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,116
- So you told him all that?
- That I did.

134
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,854
Down at the pub, I suppose,
in front of all those big ears,

135
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:47,593
with pints in their fists
and pipes in their mouths.

136
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:51,062
You may have the land, Mr Thornton,
for 600 pounds.

137
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:54,299
- Done!
- No, you can't. 610!

138
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:57,404
As I remember, you said 700 pounds.

139
00:16:57,605 --> 00:17:01,675
See here, little man... 710!

140
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,381
- How about an even thousand?
- A thousand and...

141
00:17:06,649 --> 00:17:11,255
And... and I'll be saying good day to you,
Mrs Tillane, and all here but one.

142
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:14,424
And I've got you down in my book.

143
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,965
My dad remembers his dad well.

144
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,537
Mike Thornton.
He had shoulders on him like an ox.

145
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:29,778
I saw him meself this mornin'. A tall,
handsome man, as I was passin' that chapel.

146
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:35,820
If you'd pass the pub as fast as you pass
the chapel, you'd be better off, little squint.

147
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:57,714
Just look at them!
Eating me out of house and home.

148
00:17:57,914 --> 00:18:01,851
Get back to the fields! There's work to be done.

149
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:15,601
Isn't it a bit early in the day
for the bottle... even for you?

150
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:18,740
Feeney, get your book out.

151
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:25,215
Set down the name, the one Sean Thornton.

152
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:29,819
Oh, look at me clean floor! You dirty little...

153
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:33,958
- Shut your gob.
- Aw, shut you, little man! Here.

154
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:37,496
Clean it up yourself,
or there will be no dinner tonight!

155
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:44,973
There now! Look now,
you mustn't mind himself this day.

156
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,711
That's all the work you're good for,
you little tattletail.

157
00:18:50,344 --> 00:18:54,149
- Feeney, have you written the name I gave you?
- I have.

158
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,924
Well, strike a line through it.
That's for him. Sean Thornton...

159
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:05,364
So... He bought White O' Mornin'
in spite of you.

160
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:12,308
Good for widow Tillane.

161
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,678
Pay no attention to her at all! Take no notice.

162
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:19,915
You do, and there'll be a fine wake
in this house tonight.

163
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,654
After all, he's got more right to that land
than you have!

164
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:37,472
He'll regret it to his dying day,
if ever he lives that long.

165
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:45,447
- Will it be all right if I leave my bags in here?
- I imagine they'll be safe enough.

166
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:51,588
If you see a little guy, Michaleen Flynn,
tell him I'm waiting for him in the bar.

167
00:19:51,788 --> 00:19:55,894
- It'll be a pleasure, especially for Michaleen.
- Thanks.

168
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,398
Is there anything you should like now, Yank?

169
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:04,704
If I think of anything, I'll let you know.

170
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:13,049
(BAR IS QUIET)

171
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,486
Evening.

172
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:22,227
Pleasant night.

173
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:29,234
- I'll try one of those black beers.
- Oh, the porter. Yes, sir.

174
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:39,314
Sir, will you join me? Matter of fact,
I'd like to buy everybody a drink.

175
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:43,887
I do not believe I heard your name, tall man.

176
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:46,625
Thornton. Sean Thornton.

177
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:51,061
And... your father's name?

178
00:20:51,261 --> 00:20:56,335
Mike. Michael Thornton.
He used to live here, by the Mornin'.

179
00:20:56,535 --> 00:21:00,508
I just bought the place back.
That's why I'm here.

180
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:06,248
Then your grandfather
would be Ol' Sean Thornton.

181
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:10,054
- Right.
- Bless his memory.

182
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:12,624
So it's himself you're named after.

183
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:18,897
Well, now. That being the case, it is
a pleasant evening and we will have a drink.

184
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:26,106
* There was a wild colonial boy

185
00:21:26,307 --> 00:21:30,278
# Jack Duggan was his name

186
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:36,220
# He was born and bred in Ireland

187
00:21:36,454 --> 00:21:40,757
# In a town called Castlemaine

188
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,762
- Good evening, Father.
- Is the rest of the committee here?

189
00:21:44,963 --> 00:21:46,699
- They're waiting.
- Sorry we're late.

190
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:52,005
- The fishing was bad, was it?
- Fine lot of time we had for that!

191
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,510
- Oh, Michaleen...
- Commandant Forbes.

192
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:59,683
You can forget about the Commandant.
We're at peace now.

193
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,751
Sure, but I haven't given up hope.

194
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:07,624
- Your Yankee friend is waitin' in the bar.
- Oh, he's here already...

195
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,295
Wait a minute. Who is he anyway?

196
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:16,269
He's a nice, quiet, peacelovin' man
come home to Ireland to forget his troubles.

197
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,943
- Troubles?
- Yes, he's a millionaire like all the Yanks.

198
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:24,514
But he is eccentric. Wait till I show you.

199
00:22:26,648 --> 00:22:31,287
- What is it?
- A bag to sleep in. A sleeper bag they call it.

200
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:36,228
I'm tellin' you. The sleeper bag...
Wait till I show you how it operates.

201
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:39,097
- Where does it open?
- Hurry up, I have an important appointment.

202
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:41,401
- Well, open it up!
- Here.

203
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:46,141
# At the early age of sixteen years

204
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:50,411
# He left his native home

205
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:55,484
# And to Australia's sunny shores

206
00:22:55,685 --> 00:23:00,091
# He was inclined to roam

207
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:04,830
# He robbed a wealthy squireen

208
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:09,537
# All arms he did destroy

209
00:23:09,737 --> 00:23:14,240
# A terror to Australia was

210
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:19,247
# This wild colonial boy

211
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:26,824
Sean Thornton, the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home.

212
00:23:27,024 --> 00:23:28,960
Thank you.

213
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:34,001
"And the men of Inisfree
bid you welcome home."

214
00:23:34,735 --> 00:23:38,237
- What's wrong with that little speech?
- Oh, you'd be knowin' what.

215
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:49,419
I'm a man from Inisfree, and the best man.

216
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,556
And I bid no welcome to a man fool enough

217
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,063
to pay 1000 pounds for a bit of land
that isn't worth 200!

218
00:23:57,263 --> 00:23:58,866
True for you, squire.

219
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:05,304
(MAN): Didn't I hear of someone
named Danaher bid 810?

220
00:24:07,741 --> 00:24:13,182
Get your book out.
Put his name down: Dermot Fahy.

221
00:24:13,382 --> 00:24:17,487
F-A-H-Y. No e's, Squireen Danaher.

222
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:19,390
If you were half the man you think you are,

223
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,896
you wouldn't begrudge a Thornton
the right to his birthplace.

224
00:24:23,096 --> 00:24:26,764
- What right has he to a land he's never worked?
- It's Thornton land, isn't it?

225
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:30,303
- You've too much of your own as it is.
- Quiet, if you please.

226
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:34,575
Parliamentary procedure.
Squire Danaher has the floor.

227
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:37,747
If I had the floor...

228
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,918
- ... I'd hit that big ape with it.
- Hold on.

229
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:45,190
I don't blame Mr Danaher for gettin' on his ear.

230
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,694
Who's on his ear? Why, you and ten like you
couldn't put a Danaher on his ear.

231
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:52,897
- It's just a way of speaking...
- Mind your ways, then.

232
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:58,572
The point is, it's already done. I own
the property now, and since we're neighbours...

233
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:01,142
Neighbours? Neighbours...

234
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:03,845
Never!

235
00:25:04,046 --> 00:25:08,451
And if I so much as catch you putting
one foot on my property, I... I...

236
00:25:08,686 --> 00:25:12,891
And, oh, another thing.
You keep away from my sister Mary Kate.

237
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,191
She's not for the likes of you.

238
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:19,598
Where I come from, we don't talk
about our womenfolk in saloons.

239
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:22,903
You sort of make a habit of it.
This morning it was widow Tillane.

240
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:27,274
- What's that?
- That's true. It's ashamed you should be.

241
00:25:27,474 --> 00:25:31,714
Hey, look, I'm not accusing Mary Kate.
It's him.

242
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:35,520
Why, this very moment,
let him deny it if he can.

243
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,055
At the back of the chapel,
he took liberties that he shouldn't have.

244
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,460
- I said "good morning" to her.
- Good morning?

245
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,764
- It was "good night" you had on your mind.
- That's a lie.

246
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:47,801
(MUSIC STOPS)

247
00:25:48,868 --> 00:25:51,438
- That's a what?
- I said "that's a lie".

248
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,513
That's a word I take from no man!
Put up your fists.

249
00:25:57,714 --> 00:26:00,084
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- But I'm gonna...

250
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:04,587
Thank you.

251
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:10,261
(FATHER): Danaher!
What's the matter with you?

252
00:26:10,495 --> 00:26:13,432
(FORBES): He's drunk!
Feeney, take him home, will you.

253
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:16,269
(FEENEY): Don't soil your knuckles on the man.

254
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,107
- Come on, what do you say?
- Never.

255
00:26:19,307 --> 00:26:21,944
Take the man's hand, or I'll read your name
on a mass on Sunday.

256
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:25,215
- (FEENEY): Take it.
- I'd join the Church of Ireland first.

257
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:29,785
As if they'd have you.
Shake his hand like I tell you.

258
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:33,124
- (FEENEY): Come on, come on.
- Shake hands?

259
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:45,473
It's a good grip you have.
I always hated a flappy handshake myself.

260
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,187
Father Paul!

261
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:01,959
Michaleen, introduce me to this quiet,
peacelovin' man of yours.

262
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,531
I have a strange notion
we're going to be friends, Yank.

263
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:09,370
Give me a minute.
Just let some blood run back into this.

264
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:16,277
Sean Thornton... His grandfather,
a grand man he was, was hung in Australia.

265
00:27:16,477 --> 00:27:21,918
I could tell you blood-curdlin' stories about him,
but me throat...

266
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,755
(SEAN): All right, come on.

267
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:30,896
# He was born and bred in Ireland

268
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:35,636
# In a town called Castlemaine

269
00:27:35,837 --> 00:27:40,774
# He was his father's only son

270
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:45,614
# His mother's pride and joy

271
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:50,754
# And dearly did his parents love

272
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:53,858
# This wild colonial boy

273
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:49,362
Are you sure you won't change your mind,
and come around home with me?

274
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:53,298
Don't worry about it.
I've got my sleeping bag, haven't I.

275
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,271
Well, it's a nice, soft night.

276
00:28:57,471 --> 00:29:02,176
So, I think I'll join my comrades,
and talk a little treason.

277
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:05,548
- Good night, Sean.
- Good night, Michaleen.

278
00:29:06,216 --> 00:29:07,484
(MICHALEEN): God bless you.

279
00:30:37,046 --> 00:30:39,782
(SEAN YELLS)

(MARY KATE SCREAMS)

281
00:31:08,986 --> 00:31:11,890
So bold one you are.
Who gave you leave to be kissin' me?

282
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:15,525
- So you can talk?
- Yes, I can, I will, and I do.

283
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:18,296
It's more than talk you'll be gettin'
if you step closer.

284
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:22,035
- Don't worry. You've got a wallop.
- You'll get over it, I'm thinkin'.

285
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:26,406
Some things a man doesn't get over so easily.

286
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:29,211
Like what supposin'?

287
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:34,652
Like the sight of a girl coming through the fields,
with the sun on her hair.

288
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:40,824
- Kneeling in church, with a face like a saint.
- Saint, indeed.

289
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:44,863
And now, coming to a man's house
to clean it for him.

290
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:48,368
But... that was just my way
of bein' a good Christian act.

291
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:52,606
I know it was, Mary Kate Danaher,
and it was nice of you.

292
00:31:56,145 --> 00:31:58,348
Not at all.

293
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:15,409
- Hello.
- Good morning, Mr Thornton.

294
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:18,880
- How are you, Fa..Doctor...
- No, no. Mr.

295
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:22,819
And on formal occasions,
the Reverend Mr Playfair.

296
00:33:23,019 --> 00:33:24,755
And this is Mrs Playfair.

297
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:29,461
(MRS PLAYFAIR): Well, Mr Thornton.
You are a wonder.

298
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:35,803
It looks the way all the Irish cottages
should... and so seldom do.

299
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:40,573
And only an American
would have thought of emerald green.

300
00:33:40,774 --> 00:33:45,948
- Red is more durable.
- And the roses! How nice.

301
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:52,089
You'll need lots of horse manure.
Fertiliser, I mean. Horse is the best.

302
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:58,531
Oh, I brought you a plant.
You know, "a primrose by a river's brink".

303
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:02,968
"Brim", not "brink".
The next line ends in "hymn".

304
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:07,808
Poets are so silly, aren't they?
Oh, I hope you're not one, Mr Thornton.

305
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:11,179
- Oh no, ma'am, I...
- Thornton.

306
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:14,517
There's a familiar ring to it.

307
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:20,425
Ring to it... Thornton...

308
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,332
It's a common name.
Thank you for the plant, Mrs Playfair,

309
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:28,934
this is damn... darn... awfully nice of you.

310
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,139
Oh?

311
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:50,494
It's a bed. Excuse me.

312
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:57,236
- Morning.
- (MAN): That's a fine big bed, Mr Thornton.

313
00:34:57,437 --> 00:35:00,074
Biggest one I could find.

314
00:35:14,427 --> 00:35:17,695
Is that a bed or a parade ground?

315
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:21,935
Oh, a man'd have to be a sprinter
to catch his wife in a bed like that.

316
00:35:33,283 --> 00:35:35,487
(HORSE WHINNIES)

317
00:35:37,455 --> 00:35:39,288
Whoa!

318
00:35:57,147 --> 00:36:03,053
Mr Flynn... And what are you
all dressed up for, Michaleen Oge?

319
00:36:06,189 --> 00:36:08,325
I ha...

320
00:36:13,566 --> 00:36:17,571
- I have come...
- Oh, I can see that.

321
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:21,310
- But from whose pub was it?
- P... pub?

322
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:27,549
You've a tongue like an adder.
I go about me own business,

323
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:32,088
and tell Thorn Seanton
he's well off without you.

324
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:35,861
Wait a minute. What was that?

325
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:41,334
Well, if you listened
and not be interruptin' the matchmaker.

326
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:48,077
I have come...

327
00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:53,114
- ... at the request of Thorn Seanton...
- Sean Thornton.

328
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:54,983
Shut up.

329
00:36:56,052 --> 00:37:00,658
... bachelor, and party of the first part...

330
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:09,504
... to ask of you, strictly and formally, here...

331
00:37:10,304 --> 00:37:14,577
... Mary Kate Danaher, spinster...

332
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:17,778
... and party to the second part...

333
00:37:21,684 --> 00:37:25,022
Well?. Go on, you were sayin'?

334
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:31,531
Me mouth is like a dry crust,
and the sun is that hot, and me pate...

335
00:37:31,764 --> 00:37:34,234
Would you be steppin' into the parlour?

336
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:40,039
The house may belong to my brother,
but what's in the parlour belongs to me.

337
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:45,614
I will then, and I hope there's a bottle there,
whoever it belongs to.

338
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:47,617
It could be.

339
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:59,867
You have a fine, steady hand.

340
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,687
To good bargaining.

341
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:24,264
To resume:

342
00:38:24,497 --> 00:38:26,634
- The party of the first part...
- That's him.

343
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:33,140
... has instructed me to enquire
before enterin' into formal negotiations...

344
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:36,545
- ... whether the party to the second part...
- That's me.

345
00:38:36,745 --> 00:38:43,186
... thinks kindly of the general idea,
or in his own words... American, eh...

346
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:48,227
- ... eh, yes, he wants to know if you go for it.
- Go for it?

347
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:53,431
- And if you do, he'll speak to your brother.
- That won't be easy.

348
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:55,668
Oh, as well I know it.

349
00:38:55,868 --> 00:39:00,975
He'd as soon put his fist into my teeth
as bid me the time of the day.

350
00:39:02,311 --> 00:39:06,882
What did Sean... the party of the first part,
say about my fortune?

351
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:09,754
He says he doesn't give it...

352
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,727
He says it's a matter of
complete indifference to him.

353
00:39:14,927 --> 00:39:19,231
- He did?
- He says he doesn't give a sh...

354
00:39:19,464 --> 00:39:25,706
He says it's all one to him if you come
in the clothes on your back, or without them.

355
00:39:30,212 --> 00:39:33,483
Oh, he did, did he? Well.

356
00:39:33,684 --> 00:39:38,490
A fine opinion he must have of me, if he thinks
I'd go to any man without a proper fortune.

357
00:39:38,691 --> 00:39:41,959
And this you may tell
your Mr Party of the first part:

358
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,632
When I wed, whatever's my own, goes with me.

359
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:48,435
Get up, little man.

360
00:39:56,846 --> 00:39:58,815
And all this furniture is mine.

361
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:02,987
And I have that china, and linen,
and 50 pounds in gold my father left me,

362
00:40:03,185 --> 00:40:08,526
and my mother's rings, brooches,
my grandmother's veil, her silver comb...

363
00:40:09,294 --> 00:40:15,968
Thirty pounds odd in notes and silver
I've earned these past 15 years, that's all.

364
00:40:17,471 --> 00:40:22,945
You're a well propertied woman.
I wouldn't mind marryin' you meself.

365
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:29,685
Eh, where'd you leave the bottle?

366
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:38,230
And I'd have you tell him, that I'm no pauper
to be going to him in my shift.

367
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:55,183
# Lo, young May moon is beamin' love

368
00:40:55,383 --> 00:41:00,925
# The glow of one's lamp is gleamin' love

369
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:07,065
# How sweet to row through Mourner's Grove

370
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:14,877
# While the drowsy world is dreamin'...

371
00:41:15,077 --> 00:41:17,811
- You know "The Peter And The Ghost".?
- I do not.

372
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:22,618
- Neither do I.
- Could you use a little water in your whiskey?

373
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:29,060
When I drink whiskey, I drink whiskey,
and when I drink water, I drink water.

374
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,097
Back to business now.

375
00:41:32,298 --> 00:41:36,837
What answer will I give Sean Thornton,
Mary Kate Danaher?

376
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:40,506
Well, you can tell him from me that...

377
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:46,748
... that I go for it.

378
00:41:46,948 --> 00:41:52,589
# Here's to steal a few hours from the night

379
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:57,129
# My dear

380
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:14,217
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

381
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:38,647
- Hey, what do I say?
- I'll do all the talkin'.

382
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:43,252
- And I'm suppose to stand here like a dummy?
- Shh, now.

383
00:42:49,294 --> 00:42:54,165
- Will, there's someone coming to call.
- Who?

384
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:56,603
It's... well...

385
00:42:56,836 --> 00:43:01,041
It's Michaleen Oge Flynn,
and there's a gentleman with him.

386
00:43:03,577 --> 00:43:06,314
Here, Will, put on your coat.

387
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,654
Will Danaher, they're comin' to the front door.

388
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,992
Since when has the back door
been not good enough?

389
00:43:23,135 --> 00:43:25,806
- (MICHALEEN): God bless all in this house.
- (SEAN): Good evening.

390
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,210
(MICHALEEN): Miss Danaher,
we'd like a word with your brother.

391
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:33,983
Come on in so, and welcome.

392
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:37,455
Easy now!

393
00:43:43,193 --> 00:43:49,902
Mr Sean Thornton, bachelor,
meet Miss Mary Kate Danaher, spinster.

394
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:57,179
Miss Danaher, meet Mr Thornton
from Pittsburgh, Massachusetts, USA.

395
00:43:57,746 --> 00:44:00,717
- Good evening, Miss Danaher.
- This...

396
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,653
This way, please.

397
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:16,903
- Eh, this is my brother...
- Leave the room.

398
00:44:17,103 --> 00:44:20,241
- But...
- I said, leave the room.

399
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:24,680
- Yes, Will.
- Sit down, that's what chairs are for.

400
00:44:24,881 --> 00:44:30,485
- If you've come for supper, you're late.
- Gracious invitation, but thank you, no.

401
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,958
I don't suppose there's a drop in the house.

402
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:40,231
- Help yourself to the buttermilk.
- Buttermilk? The Borgias would do better.

403
00:44:40,432 --> 00:44:46,374
We'll come with your permission
to the object of this visit.

404
00:44:46,607 --> 00:44:53,381
You've noticed, I presume,
that I'm wearin' my official black coat.

405
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:56,920
I have. For your dead friend here.

406
00:44:58,121 --> 00:45:00,524
(WILL): I need no trouble
to arrange any marriages for me.

407
00:45:00,724 --> 00:45:06,731
I see. You've been making fine progress
with widow Tillane in the last ten years.

408
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:09,303
- Is that what you've come to talk about?
- I have not.

409
00:45:09,536 --> 00:45:13,208
- I've come to talk about your sister and him.
- Aw, get out.

410
00:45:13,408 --> 00:45:17,111
If he was the last man
on the face of the earth, I'd still say no.

411
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:21,083
- Now just a minute.
- If it's a question of the girl's fortune...

412
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:25,555
Why, if it'd be a shilling piece
he wanted with her...

413
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:29,193
- ... I'd still say no.
- Come on, Michaleen. I told you so.

414
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,966
- I'll explain it to her myself.
- Hey, Yank, I'll count three.

415
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:36,270
If you're not out of the house by then,
I'll loose the dogs on you.

416
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:41,841
If you say three,
you'll never hear the man count ten.

417
00:45:53,924 --> 00:45:59,399
- Oh, Mary Kate, we tried.
- We'll see him again some other time.

418
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:07,107
I thank you anyway,
Sean Thornton, for the asking.

419
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:12,447
You don't think this changes anything?
It's what you say that counts, not him.

420
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:15,018
Now, now, Sean.
You've gone too far, that's enough.

421
00:46:15,218 --> 00:46:19,824
Say, what is this?
We're gonna get married, aren't we?

422
00:46:30,202 --> 00:46:33,874
- I don't get it.
- This is Ireland, Sean, not America.

423
00:46:34,107 --> 00:46:40,248
Without her brother's consent she couldn't,
and wouldn't. I'm sorry for both of you.

424
00:47:13,926 --> 00:47:20,031
Those were the bad days. Sean with a face
as dark as the black hunter he rode.

425
00:47:20,231 --> 00:47:22,501
A fine, ill-tempered pair they were.

426
00:47:22,735 --> 00:47:25,438
It was only a matter of time
before one or the other broke his neck.

427
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:27,941
We knew things couldn't go on this way.

428
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,156
Easy, Sean!

429
00:47:48,901 --> 00:47:51,971
Hello, Mary Kate... Danaher.

430
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:56,378
Good morning, Sean Thornton.

431
00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:07,557
So, we formed a little conspiracy.

432
00:48:07,757 --> 00:48:14,434
The Reverend Mr and Mrs Playfair,
Michaleen Oge and, saints forgive us, myself.

433
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:20,775
And on the day of the Inisfree Races,
we sprung the trap on Red Will Danaher.

434
00:48:57,887 --> 00:49:00,658
Remember, you make your speed
when you hit the water.

435
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:04,094
- Yes, father.
- And ride carefully, my son.

436
00:49:04,296 --> 00:49:05,697
Yes, mum.

437
00:49:05,897 --> 00:49:07,900
Thornton, no silks.

438

Fill up the glasses. All of them.

587
01:13:16,069 --> 01:13:21,074
Eh, today, I've given my sister in marriage.

588
01:13:22,509 --> 01:13:28,917
My only sister, and now she's gone from the house of Danaher.

589
01:13:30,219 --> 01:13:33,491
- But what's in a house without a woman?
- That's true.

590
01:13:33,691 --> 01:13:35,760
That's right, what's a house without a woman in it?

591
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:38,831
Yeah, what's a house without a woman in it?

592
01:13:39,031 --> 01:13:43,001
Where would any man of us be without a woman?

593
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:47,306
- Even Father Lonergan had a mother.
- What do you expect?

594
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:51,379
Yeah, what do you expect. What do you expect...

595
01:13:51,579 --> 01:13:54,950
So... So...

596
01:13:55,217 --> 01:13:59,891
- So, without further eloquence...
- Without further eloquence...

597
01:14:00,124 --> 01:14:05,996
So, without further eloquence,
I will give you a toast to myself...

598
01:14:07,433 --> 01:14:10,169
... who is soon to be wed.

599
01:14:17,446 --> 01:14:20,416
All she has to do is to say that little word.

600
01:14:21,851 --> 01:14:24,154
When's the happy day, Sarah darlin'?

601
01:14:24,354 --> 01:14:27,892
Have you lost the little sense you were born with?

602
01:14:28,126 --> 01:14:32,464
- What's the matter, Sarah darlin'?
- And don't "darlin"' me.

603
01:14:32,664 --> 01:14:36,635
Who gave you the right to make such an announcement?

(WILL): But Sarah... They all said...

605
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:51,489
Why... The Reverend Mr Playfair,
Mrs Reverend, Father Lonergan.

606
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:54,891
... eh, little Flynn... Michaleen.

607
01:14:56,193 --> 01:14:58,662
- Didn't you tell me...
- Oh, I didn't, I didn't.

608
01:14:58,863 --> 01:15:02,335
Oh, you lied, didn't ya? You lied, didn't ya?

609
01:15:04,837 --> 01:15:09,611
You all lied! It's bad enough for you people,
but my own priest.

610
01:15:17,321 --> 01:15:20,791
You got her by fraud and falsity. You put them up to this.

611
01:15:20,991 --> 01:15:24,295
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Will, for heaven's sake.

612
01:15:24,495 --> 01:15:27,633
- Danaher, you're crazy!
- Crazy, am I?

613
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,405
This is something you won't get, now or never!

614
01:15:33,073 --> 01:15:35,309
Now, get out of here. All of you!

615
01:15:35,543 --> 01:15:39,882
(WILL): The Reverend first, ladies and gentlemen, get out!

616
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:42,249
- (WILL): Get out!
- Come on, let's go home.

617
01:15:42,451 --> 01:15:46,556
No, not without my fortune.
It's mine, and my mother's before me...

I've dreamed of havin' my own things about me.

And the dresser over there in that corner.

And... my own china and pewter shinin' about me.

629

And now...

630
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:35,566
I didn't know you felt that way about it but...

631
01:18:35,801 --> 01:18:40,306
... seems like a lot of fuss and grief
over little furniture and stuff.

- Yeah.

634
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:16,586
- Don't touch me. You have no right.
- What do you mean no right?

635
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:22,759
(MARY KATE): I'll wear your ring,
I'll cook, and I'll wash.

636
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:26,231
I'll keep the land, but that is all!

Until I've got my dowry safe about me,
I'm no married woman.

I'm the servant I've always been,
without anything of my own.

That's ridiculous! You're my wife, and fortune...

- What is this?
- Haven't I been trying to tell you?

641
01:19:43,519 --> 01:19:48,325
Not until you have my dowry, you haven't got any bit of me.
Me, myself!

- All right.

You'll have your dowry, or daughter of fortune,
or whatever you call it.

648
01:20:20,933 --> 01:20:23,135
Well, get it then.

- I don't give... a hang about the money.
- But he does! That's the whole point of it.

735
01:31:51,894 --> 01:31:56,434
- Now will you go and ask him?
- No. Why shame ourselves?

736
01:31:56,567 --> 01:32:02,509
Shame? The shame's on you, not on me.
Or on me too, if I married a coward.

737
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:05,980
Is that what you think of me?

738
01:32:06,113 --> 01:32:08,581
What else if you let him rob you out of my money?

739
01:32:08,682 --> 01:32:14,623
Money! I'm sick of the talk of it.
Is that all you Danahers think about? Money?

740
01:33:48,173 --> 01:33:52,178
(FATHER): Quiet! He's just behind that rock.

741
01:33:52,378 --> 01:33:55,583
- This is very important...
- Oh, salmon! He's winking at me.

742
01:33:55,783 --> 01:33:58,019
I've been trying to catch this one for ten years.

743
01:33:58,219 --> 01:34:02,225
I've got to talk to you about my husband and myself.

744
01:34:02,425 --> 01:34:04,494
There he is.

745
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:08,531
Father, I... I...

746
01:34:11,768 --> 01:34:13,438
You see...

747
01:34:14,473 --> 01:34:19,146
- Father, could I... tell you in the Irish?
- Hush, hush.

748
01:34:22,149 --> 01:34:26,756
(SHE SPEAKS IN GAELIC)

749
01:34:38,369 --> 01:34:41,674
(HE ANSWERS IN GAELIC)

750
01:34:43,343 --> 01:34:46,546
Sleeping bag, Father, with...

751
01:34:48,215 --> 01:34:50,752
... with buttons.

752
01:34:53,756 --> 01:34:57,192
(SHE SPEAKS IN GAELIC)

753
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:06,371
Woman, Ireland may be a poor country, God help us,

754
01:35:06,604 --> 01:35:10,476
but here a married man sleeps in a bed, not a bag,

755
01:35:10,676 --> 01:35:15,750
and for your own good... Help, help, there he is!

756
01:35:17,085 --> 01:35:19,787
- I've been waiting for this for 10 years!
- Keep his head up.

757
01:35:19,987 --> 01:35:24,727
- There's that beauty, that...
- Keep his head up. Keep a tight line.

758
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,798
I've got you! I'll get him!

759
01:35:30,468 --> 01:35:33,572
- Tight line it is.
- Keep his head up!

760
01:35:33,805 --> 01:35:36,376
His head is up!

761
01:35:38,011 --> 01:35:43,150
(FATHER): For ten years I have...
Get the net, woman.

762
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:48,023
Oh, you got him, Father. Keep his head up, you fool!

763
01:35:49,024 --> 01:35:50,393
Get the net!

764
01:35:52,461 --> 01:35:54,999
Get the net, woman!

765
01:35:56,501 --> 01:36:00,205
- God help us!
- Oh.

766
01:36:04,077 --> 01:36:06,378
Sleeping bags...

767
01:36:54,173 --> 01:36:58,443
# If you ever go across the sea to Ireland

768
01:36:59,378 --> 01:37:06,521
# Then maybe at the closin' of your day

769
01:37:07,623 --> 01:37:12,396
# You will sit and watch the moon rise

770
01:37:12,596 --> 01:37:16,834
# Over Claddagh

771
01:37:17,603 --> 01:37:22,507
# And see the sun go down

772
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:28,481
# On Galway Bay

773
01:37:30,151 --> 01:37:37,327
# For the breeze is blowin' across the sea from Ireland

774
01:37:38,462 --> 01:37:40,597
(SINGING STOPS)

775
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:44,802
You're just in time. Just done me drink.

776
01:37:45,002 --> 01:37:47,704
- Join us, Sean.
- Oh, you will have a drink, Sean?

777
01:37:47,872 --> 01:37:49,875
No, thanks.

778
01:37:52,878 --> 01:37:55,784
I wanna talk to you, in private.

779
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:04,060
- If there's anythin' you got to say, say it here.
- I'd rather talk in private.

780
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:09,365
What's the matter? You're among friends.
They fought for you, didn't they?

781
01:38:09,566 --> 01:38:14,339
- Maybe they'll do it again.
- I'm not askin' anybody to do my fightin' for me.

782
01:38:14,539 --> 01:38:20,581
- Oh, so you're willing to do your own, are you?
- You know what I came for.

783
01:38:20,781 --> 01:38:24,853
I do. I just want to hear you ask for it.

784
01:38:25,053 --> 01:38:28,491
Just ask for it, Yank.

785
01:38:28,691 --> 01:38:32,595
- You've got 20 pounds on him.
- And so I have.

786
01:38:34,263 --> 01:38:39,804
What if I put one of me fists in me pocket?
Right or left? You choose, go on.

787
01:38:40,037 --> 01:38:43,176
Go on, that's fair enough, isn't it?

788
01:38:45,678 --> 01:38:47,547
(WILL LAUGHS)

789
01:38:48,182 --> 01:38:51,153
The fightin' Thornton!

790
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:21,688
- It was Mr Thornton, so I brought him in.
- Bless my soul. Sit down.

791
01:39:21,889 --> 01:39:23,957
- Have you tiddled your last wink?
- I have.

792
01:39:24,157 --> 01:39:26,295
- No cheating?
- I have not.

793
01:39:26,996 --> 01:39:31,602
- Do you play tiddly-winks?
- No, I...

794
01:39:31,802 --> 01:39:37,309
- Maybe I shouldn't have butted in like this...
- Nonsense. How is your lovely bride?

795
01:39:37,509 --> 01:39:41,281
- Fine.
- Elizabeth, say good night to Mr Thornton.

796
01:39:41,481 --> 01:39:46,986
But he's only just come... oh. Very well.
Good night, Mr Thornton.

797
01:39:47,186 --> 01:39:49,156
- Good night.
- Good night, Cyril.

798
01:39:49,356 --> 01:39:53,194
Good night, Elizabeth. Pleasant dreams.

799
01:39:55,499 --> 01:39:58,669
- Are you sure...
- Good night, Elizabeth.

800
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:04,143
You're the only one I can level with.
I gotta talk to somebody, or I'll blow my top.

801
01:40:04,343 --> 01:40:07,580
- Danaher, of course?
- Yeah.

802
01:40:07,780 --> 01:40:12,519
Since you know who I am... or was,
you know why I don't want any fighting.

803
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:16,257
Yes, I was reading about it again this evening.

804
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:23,166
Some men collect butterflies, some stamps.
My hobby's always been sporting events.

805
01:40:23,366 --> 01:40:25,402
There it is.

806
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:27,706
"Trooper Thorn quits ring"

807
01:40:27,906 --> 01:40:31,810
"Heavyweight challenger hangs up gloves
after fatal knockout"

808
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:34,112
"Vows he will never fight again"

809
01:40:36,414 --> 01:40:38,852
It's a very understandable reaction.

810
01:40:39,086 --> 01:40:44,261
The papers all say it was an accident.
Just one of those things.

811
01:40:44,494 --> 01:40:50,301
It's just one of those things in a scrapbook,
but when you carry it around in here...

812
01:40:52,203 --> 01:40:55,940
Tony Gardello was a good egg.

813
01:40:56,140 --> 01:41:02,081
Nice little wife and a home, a couple of kids.
A clean fighter.

814
01:41:02,949 --> 01:41:07,789
I didn't go in there to outbox him.
I went there to beat his brains out.

815
01:41:07,989 --> 01:41:12,561
To drive him into the canvas, to murder him.
That's what I did.

816
01:41:13,195 --> 01:41:18,036
For what? Purse, a piece of the gate.

817
01:41:19,736 --> 01:41:21,772
Lousy money.

818
01:41:21,972 --> 01:41:25,476
And now money is behind your trouble with Danaher.

819
01:41:25,677 --> 01:41:31,117
They think I'm afraid of fighting.
All the friends I've made, even my wife.

820
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:35,690
- Well, aren't you in a way?
- Did you ever kill a man?

821
01:41:37,259 --> 01:41:42,364
Well, I have, and all this talk about her big fortune...

822
01:41:43,333 --> 01:41:45,702
It's not that important.

823
01:41:46,936 --> 01:41:49,173
Perhaps it is to her.

824
01:41:50,375 --> 01:41:54,981
It must be strange to you from America,

825
01:41:55,182 --> 01:41:59,653
but it's an old, old custom here, and believe me,
it's a good custom.

826
01:41:59,853 --> 01:42:02,725
The fortune means more to her than just the money.

827
01:42:02,925 --> 01:42:06,828
Not to me, it isn't. Not worth fighting for.

828
01:42:07,028 --> 01:42:10,733
- Is your wife's love worth fighting for?
- I don't know.

829
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:19,412
All I know is that... I won't fight,
unless I'm mad enough to kill,

830
01:42:19,612 --> 01:42:23,316
and if that means losin' her... I don't know.

831
01:42:24,183 --> 01:42:28,490
- Maybe she doesn't love me enough.
- It's a difficult situation.

832
01:42:29,892 --> 01:42:33,395
I think you'll find the right answer in God's good time.

833
01:42:33,628 --> 01:42:37,066
And when that time comes, I hope I'm still here.

834
01:42:37,266 --> 01:42:41,171
- You're not leaving, are you?
- It's a possibility.

835
01:42:41,371 --> 01:42:45,077
My bishop is coming tomorrow on his annual visit,

836
01:42:45,311 --> 01:42:50,618
and I've got such a small congregation,
just 2-3 people at the service.

837
01:42:50,818 --> 01:42:55,923
- He may transfer me.
- The place wouldn't be the same without you.

838
01:42:56,857 --> 01:43:02,498
Elizabeth and I just love this place.
We were born here too, you know.

839
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:06,937
The bishop's a good egg, maybe it'll be all right.

840
01:43:07,138 --> 01:43:11,810
Oh, by the way. Don't underestimate Danaher.

841
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:16,316
He may be clumsy, but he's got
a tremendous right and a jaw of granite.

842
01:43:19,152 --> 01:43:22,689
I did a little bit of boxing in my time.

843
01:43:32,271 --> 01:43:34,672
You won't be laughin' now, will you?

844
01:43:37,376 --> 01:43:39,579
It was at Trinity.

845
01:43:39,779 --> 01:43:43,016
"Lightweight champion, 19... "

846
01:43:43,216 --> 01:43:47,186
The year doesn't matter. It was long, long ago.

847
01:43:50,025 --> 01:43:52,761
All right.

848
01:43:53,361 --> 01:43:56,100
By the way, would you join me in a glass of...

849
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,269
Oh, no.

850
01:44:00,605 --> 01:44:04,543
No. You'll be in training now, of course.

851
01:45:14,631 --> 01:45:18,801
- (MARY KATE): Did you have any supper?
- No.

852
01:45:19,002 --> 01:45:21,138
(SEAN): I'm not hungry.

853
01:45:21,338 --> 01:45:26,345
- The drink sometimes does that to a man.
- I haven't had anything to drink.

854
01:45:26,578 --> 01:45:31,585
(SEAN): If you wanna know, I was talking to the vicar.

855
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:36,992
- Mr Playfair.
- That's strange.

856
01:45:44,101 --> 01:45:46,402
I had a long talk with Father Lonergan.

857
01:46:49,149 --> 01:46:52,520
Woman of the house! Where's me tea?

858
01:46:56,325 --> 01:46:57,825
Mary Kate?

859
01:46:58,025 --> 01:47:04,267
(MICHALEEN): Save your breath, boy.
She's gone from you, and small wonder.

860
01:47:04,467 --> 01:47:10,008
- What are you talking about? Where is she?
- She came tappin' at me door.

861
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:13,480
- "Will you join me to the train", says she.
- Why?

862
01:47:13,714 --> 01:47:18,986
The very question. "Why", says I.
"Because I love him", says she.

863
01:47:19,186 --> 01:47:22,723
"I love him too much to go on livin'
with a man I'm ashamed of."

864
01:47:24,425 --> 01:47:29,131
- What time was this?
- Time for the Dublin train.

865
01:47:42,116 --> 01:47:44,418
Saddle up my horse, will you, please.

866
01:47:45,551 --> 01:47:47,553
Saddle his horse?

867
01:47:49,958 --> 01:47:53,529
I'll have no part in helpin'
you to put more shame on her.

868
01:47:55,232 --> 01:47:57,467
Saddle his horse...

869
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:04,009
Dam da dam da, diddle de da...

870
01:48:32,944 --> 01:48:34,512
Well, we're off!

871
01:48:34,713 --> 01:48:39,419
Then, might I suggest that the train already
is four and a half hours late.

872
01:48:39,619 --> 01:48:42,390
Now, is it my fault?

873
01:48:42,623 --> 01:48:46,829
There's a match at Ballygar, and the champions of all Ireland...

874
01:48:47,029 --> 01:48:51,635
If you knew your country's history as well as
you claim to know it,

875
01:48:51,836 --> 01:48:57,441
you'd know that they haven't been beaten
west of the Shannon for the last 22 years.

876
01:48:57,641 --> 01:49:00,846
- True!
- It's a lie!

877
01:50:10,264 --> 01:50:12,900
If this means what I hope it means...

878
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:17,173
Danaher versus the Yank.
It'll be weeks on the green this time.

879
01:50:25,751 --> 01:50:27,254
Morning.

880
01:50:36,596 --> 01:50:38,099
Good day to you, sir.

881
01:50:51,751 --> 01:50:55,186
Five minutes, did you say? Right!

882
01:50:56,556 --> 01:51:02,797
- He's walkin' her back, the whole long way!
- It's Homeric, that's what it is, Homeric.

883
01:51:02,997 --> 01:51:06,635
- Post a lookout. They may go home first.
- Where's your pistol?.

884
01:51:06,835 --> 01:51:09,807
- In the same place.
- Excuse me, general.

885
01:51:11,074 --> 01:51:16,081
One by land, two by sea, and I'll follow the lot.

886
01:51:16,281 --> 01:51:17,883
What a day for Inisfree!

887
01:51:18,083 --> 01:51:23,388
On a day like this I can say only one thing.
Gentlemen, the drinks are on the house!

888
01:51:26,459 --> 01:51:28,429
Well, they are.

889
01:51:59,401 --> 01:52:03,540
(WOMAN): Darling, here is your shoe!

890
01:52:07,677 --> 01:52:09,581
Why, you...

891
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:18,090
It's only five miles. Just a good stretch of the legs.

892
01:52:23,164 --> 01:52:26,803
- You lost your shoe.
- Thank you very kindly, sir.

893
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:58,608
(WOMAN): Mr... Mr Sean! Here's
a good stick to beat the lovely lady.

894
01:53:00,142 --> 01:53:02,079
Thanks!

895
01:53:04,349 --> 01:53:06,217
(GUNSHOTS FROM OUTSIDE)

896
01:54:02,890 --> 01:54:07,627
I think your in-laws are comin'
to visit you, Squire Danaher.

897
01:54:44,642 --> 01:54:49,981
Danaher, you owe me 350 pounds. Let's have it.

898
01:54:59,125 --> 01:55:01,461
So, the IRA is in this, too, eh?

899
01:55:01,662 --> 01:55:07,136
If it were, Will Danaher, not
a stone of your fine house'd be standin'.

900
01:55:07,369 --> 01:55:10,073
A beautiful sentiment.

901
01:55:14,178 --> 01:55:16,381
I'll pay you... never.

902
01:55:16,581 --> 01:55:19,818
That breaks all bargains.

903
01:55:21,154 --> 01:55:25,391
(SEAN): You can take your sister back.
It's your custom, not mine.

904
01:55:25,592 --> 01:55:29,129
(SEAN): No fortune, no marriage. We call it quits.

905
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:38,075
You'd do this to me, your own wife?

906
01:55:38,276 --> 01:55:41,145
- After what...
- (SEAN): It's done.

907
01:55:49,922 --> 01:55:53,059
There's your dirty money. Take it.

908
01:55:53,293 --> 01:55:56,598
Count it, you spawn, and look.

909
01:55:56,799 --> 01:56:00,937
If ever I see that face of yours again,
I'll push that through it.

910
01:56:18,458 --> 01:56:20,561
Charge it!

911
01:56:24,198 --> 01:56:28,271
I'll be goin' on home now.
I'll have the supper ready for you.

912
01:57:07,419 --> 01:57:09,624
All right, Will, you asked for it.

913
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:25,842
Three to one given on Danaher. Three to one...

914
01:57:26,042 --> 01:57:31,016
- I'll have some of that. Ten on Thornton.
- Done! Anyone else?

915
01:58:25,384 --> 01:58:29,589
(MICHALEEN): Gentlemen, if you please.
This is a private fight.

916
01:58:29,789 --> 01:58:34,061
The Marquis of Queensbury rules
will be observed on all occasions.

917
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:36,897
Mind your nose, squire.

918
01:58:37,598 --> 01:58:40,335
Okay with me, Michaleen!

919
01:58:44,308 --> 01:58:45,577
Thanks.

920
01:58:45,777 --> 01:58:49,814
Non-belligerents will kindly remain neutral.

921
01:58:50,014 --> 01:58:53,853
Now, shake hands and come out fighting. I thank you.

922
01:58:54,054 --> 01:58:57,524
Did you hear that, everybody?
The Marquis of Queensbury rules.

923
01:58:57,757 --> 01:58:59,959
- The Marquis of Queensbury rules.
- Mar..

924
01:59:05,333 --> 01:59:08,404
Come on, get up, Marquis of Queensbury.

925
01:59:08,605 --> 01:59:13,043
- I hope that Thornton beats him senseless.
- He's a married man, Sarah.

926
01:59:13,244 --> 01:59:17,115
Who cares about him? It's that big bully concerns me.

927
01:59:17,315 --> 01:59:20,418
"I'm the best man in Inisfree."
As if I didn't know that.

928
01:59:25,191 --> 01:59:29,196
Call them and tell them to send reinforcements.
There's a riot here.

929
01:59:45,150 --> 01:59:47,351
Five to one on the big chap, Snuffy.

930
01:59:47,552 --> 01:59:50,990
- Given or taken?
- Given.

931
02:00:04,508 --> 02:00:07,243
- You've had enough?
- No.

932
02:00:12,282 --> 02:00:15,087
Well, give a man a hand, then.

933
02:00:22,597 --> 02:00:24,900
Yes, inspector. Thank you, sir.

934
02:00:25,133 --> 02:00:28,238
- What did he say?
- To put five pounds on Danaher's nose.

935
02:00:29,239 --> 02:00:33,010
- Another ten on Thornton!
- Another.

936
02:00:34,444 --> 02:00:39,618
- A pound on Danaher.
- Two pounds on Danaher, please.

937
02:00:39,818 --> 02:00:42,388
Two pounds?

938
02:00:42,788 --> 02:00:46,560
"... hands of a hundred battles,
eye on a thousand besides... "

939
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:50,031
"... stood alone on the victorious field,
his buckler bent... "

940
02:00:50,232 --> 02:00:53,235
"... his broken sword clutched in his mighty hand... "

941
02:00:53,435 --> 02:00:59,441
"... the blood of a thousand wounds
oozing from his open veins... "

942
02:00:59,641 --> 02:01:02,011
(NOISE OUTSIDE)

943
02:01:26,243 --> 02:01:29,913
- Father! Father Lonergan!
- Shh, shhh.

944
02:01:30,148 --> 02:01:33,653
- A big fight in the town!
- And in this fish right here.

945
02:01:33,853 --> 02:01:37,457
- I'd put a stop to it but...
- You do that. It's your duty.

946
02:01:37,657 --> 02:01:40,761
But you see, it was Danaher and Sean Thornton!

947
02:01:40,961 --> 02:01:43,731
- Who?
- Danaher and Sean Thornton.

948
02:01:43,931 --> 02:01:46,434
Why the devil didn't you tell me?

949
02:02:03,824 --> 02:02:07,293
- Shouldn't we put a stop to it?
- We should, lad, we should.

950
02:02:07,493 --> 02:02:10,730
It's our duty, yes, it's our duty.

951
02:02:18,308 --> 02:02:21,012
Come on, come on!

952
02:02:27,987 --> 02:02:31,858
- How's that bettin' going?
- Even money, but don't ruin it.

953
02:02:33,794 --> 02:02:37,931
Well, Danaher, you're a good fight,
I'll say that for you.

954
02:02:38,133 --> 02:02:42,438
When it comes to that, it's been a pleasure beatin' you.

955
02:02:49,947 --> 02:02:51,517
Thanks.

956
02:02:53,018 --> 02:02:56,923
- Will you take another 20 on Thornton?
- No, the book's closed.

957
02:02:58,690 --> 02:03:03,097
- A pound on Thornton against the squire.
- Go away!

958
02:03:05,332 --> 02:03:08,571
- How about a drink?
- The drink will be on the house.

959
02:03:08,806 --> 02:03:13,777
That's a good idea. The people of Ballyglon are comin'
over by bus, thousands of them.

960
02:03:13,977 --> 02:03:17,816
That's a good idea, not that I'm tired.
I'm as fresh as a daisy.

961
02:03:18,017 --> 02:03:21,287
You look more like a black-eyed Susan to me. Let's go.

962
02:03:21,754 --> 02:03:25,624
- Is that a public house?
- Yes, your lordship.

963
02:03:25,825 --> 02:03:27,828
- Are they going in?
- Yes, your lordship.

964
02:03:28,028 --> 02:03:33,203
- Does that mean that the fight's over?
- No, that's just the end of round one.

965
02:03:35,904 --> 02:03:37,874
Come, keep away, keep away!

966
02:03:45,583 --> 02:03:51,424
Whiskey? No, that'll be too warm,
it'll get your blood up. Porter is the very thing.

967
02:03:51,657 --> 02:03:55,997
- Ah, it's peaceful and quiet in here, isn't it?
- Yeah.

968
02:03:56,197 --> 02:03:57,900
You know...

969
02:04:00,668 --> 02:04:03,139
This has been a fight I'd come a long way to see.

970
02:04:03,339 --> 02:04:05,942
I hope you can stick around for the finish.

971
02:04:07,342 --> 02:04:09,980
Don't worry about that!

972
02:04:13,217 --> 02:04:18,891
- You know, Yank. I've taken quite a likin' to you.
- I'm gettin' real fond of you, too.

973
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:24,064
Your widow, me sister... She could've done a lot worse.

974
02:04:24,264 --> 02:04:26,234
- True, true.
- Poor woman.

975
02:04:26,469 --> 02:04:30,138
- Thanks, fill them up again.
- You buy me no drinks.

976
02:04:30,338 --> 02:04:34,810
- The drinks are on the house, sir.
- I'm takin' no drinks from you, squint.

977
02:04:35,010 --> 02:04:39,050
- I'm buyin' the drinks.
- You can buy me a drink at your wake.

978
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:41,219
And not before.

979
02:04:43,355 --> 02:04:45,059
I'm buyin'!

980
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:51,900
Bar towel!

981
02:04:55,670 --> 02:04:58,407
- What time is it?
- Half past five, sir.

982
02:05:05,082 --> 02:05:06,351
Lord, he beat you!

983
02:05:16,497 --> 02:05:22,770
Why... I hope you won't be vexed with me,
but I've lost three pounds to Mrs Delany.

984
02:05:23,004 --> 02:05:25,574
I know I shouldn't have bet but...

985
02:05:25,808 --> 02:05:28,578
There you are, Stuffy, 15 pounds.

986
02:05:31,248 --> 02:05:35,020
- Hello there, Elizabeth.
- Your lordship.

987
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:40,227
- And what have you been doing all day?
- If you'll excuse me, I'll...

988
02:05:40,427 --> 02:05:43,262
I'll get your tea, Snuffy.

989
02:05:45,633 --> 02:05:49,704
# There was a wild colonial boy

990
02:05:49,904 --> 02:05:53,109
# Jack Duggan was his name

991
02:05:53,309 --> 02:05:57,449
# He was born and bred in Ireland

992
02:05:57,649 --> 02:06:01,420
# In a place called Castlemaine

993
02:06:01,620 --> 02:06:05,558
# He was his father's only son

994
02:06:05,758 --> 02:06:09,263
# His mother's pride and joy

995
02:06:09,463 --> 02:06:13,467
# And dearly did his parents love

996
02:06:13,667 --> 02:06:18,040
# This wild colonial boy

997
02:06:29,488 --> 02:06:33,593
Woman of the house! I brought the brother home to supper.

998
02:06:34,894 --> 02:06:37,597
He's kindly welcome.

999
02:06:38,833 --> 02:06:40,802
God bless all in this house.

1000
02:06:41,002 --> 02:06:42,871
- Wipe your feet.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1001
02:06:43,071 --> 02:06:46,677
Sit down, sit down. That's what chairs are for.

1002
02:06:51,883 --> 02:06:54,185
Hurry it up!

1003
02:07:01,327 --> 02:07:06,835
Well, then. So peace and quiet came once again to Inisfree,

1004
02:07:07,035 --> 02:07:10,407
and we were... Good heavens, what's that woman up to now.?

1005
02:07:10,607 --> 02:07:14,010
Make way, she'll be runnin'you down with that.!

1006
02:07:24,122 --> 02:07:27,660
When the Reverend Mr Playfair comes down,

1007
02:07:27,861 --> 02:07:31,466
I want us all to cheer like Protestants. Now, spread out!

1008
02:07:45,183 --> 02:07:47,084
(CROWD CHEERS)

1009
02:07:47,284 --> 02:07:51,490
Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!

1010
02:08:06,043 --> 02:08:12,081
No patty fingers, if you please.
The proprieties at all times.

1011
02:08:13,951 --> 02:08:16,354
Hold on to your hats. Come on.
