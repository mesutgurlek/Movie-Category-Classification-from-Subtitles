1
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:33,528
Robbed. Cleaned out.

2
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:38,366
$9,967, precisely as I told
you over the telephone.

3
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,828
And that girl did it,
Marion Holland.

4
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,789
That's the girl,
Marion Holland!

5
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:49,002
- Can you describe her, Mr. Strutt?
- Certainly I can describe her.

6
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:53,048
Five feet five, 110 pounds,

7
00:02:54,216 --> 00:03:00,889
size eight dress,
blue eyes, black wavy hair,

8
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,934
even features, good teeth...

9
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,479
(CHUCKLING)
Well, what's so damn funny?

10
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,023
There's been a grand larceny
committed on these premises!

11
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:14,944
Yes, sir. You were saying,
black hair, wavy,

12
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,322
- even features, good teeth.
- Yeah. Yes.

13
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,200
- And she was in your employ four months?
- Mmm.

14
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,370
What were her references, sir?

15
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,955
Well, as a matter of fact...

16
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,210
Yes, she had references,
I'm sure.

17
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,837
Oh, Mr. Strutt,
don't you remember?

18
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,548
She didn't have any
references at all.

19
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:40,011
Well, she worked the copying
and adding machines.

20
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,138
No confidential duties.

21
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,477
Mr. Rutland. I didn't
know you were in town.

22
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,356
Just had a robbery.
Almost $10,000.

23
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,567
So I gathered. By a pretty
girl with no references.

24
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,486
You remember her.
I pointed her out

25
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:58,530
to you the last
time you were here.

26
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:02,909
You said something about how I was
improving the looks of the place.

27
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,912
Oh, that one.
The brunette with the legs.

28
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:10,041
Excuse me, men.
Mr. Rutland's a client.

29
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,170
I don't think you've got time to
discuss business today, Mr. Strutt.

30
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,340
- Not with your crime wave on your hands.
- Oh, no, no.

31
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,135
Always time for Rutland business.
You know that.

32
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,679
How are things
in Philadelphia?

33
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:27,225
The little witch! I'll have
her put away for 20 years!

34
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,727
I knew she was
too good to be true.

35
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:33,648
Always so eager to work
overtime, never made a mistake.

36
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:37,277
Always pulling her skirt down
over her knees

37
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,822
as though they were
a national treasure.

38
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:44,659
She seemed so nice,
so efficient, so...

39
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,244
Resourceful?

40
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,695
P.A. ANNOUNCER: <i>Wilmington,

46
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,914
- Hello, Mrs. Maitland.
- Oh, so nice to have you back, Miss Edgar.

47
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:40,335
- We put you in your same room.
- Thank you, Mrs. Maitland.

48
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,337
Can someone drive me over
to Garrod's right away?

49
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,048
Of course.
Any time you're ready.

50
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,592
As soon as I change.

51
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,444
How do, Miss Edgar?
Good to have you back.

52
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,154
Hello, Mr. Garrod.

53
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,947
MARNIE: Oh,
there's my darling.

54
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:13,576
GARROD: That big old spoiled baby
of yours knew something was up.

55
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:15,536
Tried to bite me twice
already this morning.

56
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,748
Oh, Forio, if you want
to bite somebody, bite me.

57
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,551
Thanks.

58
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,955
GIRLS: (SINGING) Mother,
Mother, I am ill.

59
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,083
Send for the doctor
over the hill.

60
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,919
Call for the doctor.
Call for the nurse.

61
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:08,005
Call for the lady
with the alligator purse.

62
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,092
"Mumps," said the doctor.
"Measles," said the nurse.

63
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,845
"Nothing," said the lady
with the alligator purse.

64
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,639
- How many years will I live?
- Thank you.

65
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:21,686
GIRLS: One, two, three,
four, five, six,

66
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,314
- seven, eight, nine, 10, 11...
- Oh, it's you. Where's my mother?

67
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,151
She's making
a pecan pie for me!

68
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,320
That figures.

69
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,490
GIRLS: Mother,
Mother, I am ill.

70
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,409
Send for the doctor...

71
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:39,912
WOMAN: Who is it, Jessie?

72
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,289
MARNIE: Hello, Mama.

73
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,418
Well, I just swan. Marnie!
If you're not the very limit.

74
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,795
I can't take in the way
you jump around

75
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,214
all over the place
like you do.

76
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:54,051
MAMA: Boston, Massachusetts.
Elizabeth, New Jersey.

77
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,264
I brought you
some chrysanthemums.

78
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,433
MAMA: Those gladiolus
are brand fresh.

79
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,978
Miss Cotton brought them
to me only last night.

80
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:07,398
I never could stand gladiolus.
I'll get rid of these.

81
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:11,319
For land's sake... Marnie,
now watch the dripping.

82
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,113
Here, Jessica, why don't you
take these home to your mother?

83
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,657
She don't get home
from work till 6:00.

84
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm supposed to
stay here till 6:00.

85
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,455
Well, take them out to the kitchen then.
Just get rid of them.

86
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,248
Take them on out to
the kitchen, Jessie, honey,

87
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,125
before they drip all over.

88
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,587
We could stand gladiolus!

89
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,175
I send you
plenty of money, Mama.

90
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,843
You don't have to
be a babysitter.

91
00:10:35,928 --> 00:10:39,639
Well, whoever said I did
have to? It's my pleasure.

92
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,309
That smart little old Jessie.

93
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:46,479
Marnie, if you could just hear
some of the things that she says.

94
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,731
Oh, but I do.

95
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:51,108
Seems to me I get a report
in exhaustive detail

96
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:54,487
on all the bright sayings
of old Jessie Cotton.

97
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:58,032
What's more, every time I come
home, she's roosting here.

98
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:03,412
I see that you've lighted up
your hair, Marnie.

99
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:08,042
- A little. Why? Don't you like it?
- No.

100
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:13,464
MAMA: Too blonde hair always looks like
a woman's trying to attract the men.

101
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,884
Men and a good name
don't go together.

102
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,472
I brought you something, Mama.

103
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,936
Now what have you thrown
good money away on?

104
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,646
Oh, Marnie.

105
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:32,567
You shouldn't spend all your
money on me like you do.

106
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,361
But that's what
money's for, to spend.

107
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,990
Like the Bible says,
"Money answereth all things."

108
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:43,035
We don't talk smart about the
Bible in this house, missy!

109
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:53,170
Well, I just swan!
How do I wear it?

110
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:56,299
Like this.
Real high up under the chin.

111
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,510
MARNIE: Oh, it's smart.
It's very, very smart.

112
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:03,139
Going around buying fur pieces
like they's nothing.

113
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,641
Mr. Pemberton gave
me another raise.

114
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:10,229
I told Miss Cotton my daughter is
private secretary to a millionaire.

115
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:14,901
He's as generous with her as if
she was his very own daughter.

116
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:18,362
Miss Bernice, don't you want
to get my hair brushed up

117
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:19,906
before my mommy gets home?

118
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,534
Well, I sure do, honey.
You run up and get the brush.

119
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:27,663
Oh, that kid and her hair.

120
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,542
Puts me in mind of yours
when you was little.

121
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,085
The color.

122
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,048
This side of the street
don't get the afternoon sun.

123
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,926
My hip and my leg
ache me something awful.

124
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,016
(FOOTSTEPS)

125
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,477
I got the hairbrush!

126
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,315
Uh, Marnie, mind my leg.

127
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,504
MAMA: I never had time to
take care of Marnie's hair

128
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,131
when she was
a little kid like you.

129
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:22,385
- How come?
- Oh, child!

130
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:26,138
Well, after I had
my bad accident,

131
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:30,059
well, first I was sick so
long, and then I had to work.

132
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,145
JESSIE: Didn't you all
have a daddy either?

133
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,191
MAMA: No, we didn't.
We surely did not!

134
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,654
There. As pretty as
brushing can make you.

135
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,742
Oh, sugarpop, it's 6:05.
You better scat on home.

136
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,037
And you be sure to take
your mama those glads.

137
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:56,585
How about my pie?
How about my pecan pie?

138
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,755
I'll get it done tonight
and bring it over to you.

139
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,174
Now, Jessie, you mind
you go straight home.

140
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:06,595
Okay. Bye, Miss Bernice.
See you later, Miss Bernice.

141
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,683
(DOOR CLOSING)

142
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,771
Do you really like the scarf, Mama?
It's real mink.

143
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:20,568
Oh, there. You look just
like an old man's darling.

144
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:24,196
No man ever give
me anything so good.

145
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,365
We don't need men, Mama.

146
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,369
We can do very well for ourselves.
Just you and me.

147
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,456
A decent woman
don't have need for any man.

148
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:39,462
Look at you, Marnie. I told Miss
Cotton, look at my girl Marnie.

149
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:43,215
She's too smart to go getting
herself mixed up with men,

150
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,800
none of them.

151
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:51,932
Well, let's go on back to the kitchen.
I've got to see to that pie.

152
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,080
Uh, Marnie,
I've been thinking seriously

153
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:18,000
about asking Miss Cotton and
Jessie to move in here with me.

154
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,087
Miss Cotton is
a real nice woman.

155
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,759
She's decent. A hard-working woman
with a little girl to raise.

156
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,762
Come on, Mama, why don't you
just say what you mean?

157
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,182
What you want is for Jessie
to come live with you.

158
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:40,106
Marnie, you oughtn't let yourself act
jealous of a little old kid like that.

159
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,985
She don't bother me none. And we
could always use extra money.

160
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,781
The Cottons are
mighty decent people.

161
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,538
Why don't you love me, Mama?

162
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,458
I've always
wondered why you don't.

163
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,381
Oh, you never give me one part
of the love you give Jessie.

164
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,136
Mama.

165
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:16,392
Why do you always move away from me?
Why? What's wrong with me?

166
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,061
Nothing!
Nothing's wrong with you.

167
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,148
No. You don't think that.

168
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,816
You've always thought
there was something

169
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,568
wrong with me,
haven't you? Always!

170
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,319
I never.

171
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:33,742
My God! When I think of the things
I've done to try to make you love me.

172
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:36,287
The things I've done!

173
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,878
What are you thinking now, Mama?
About the things I've done?

174
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:49,091
What do you think they are? Things
that aren't decent, is that it?

175
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:51,010
Why, you think I'm
Mr. Pemberton's girl.

176
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,928
Is that why you don't
want me to touch you?

177
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:56,557
Is that how you think I get
the money to set you up?

178
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,901
I'm... I'm sorry, Mama.

179
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:10,654
I don't know what got
into me talking like that.

180
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,157
I know you've never really
thought anything bad about me.

181
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,783
No, I never.

182
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:20,497
Well, I'm sorry. I really am.
I'll pick up the pecans.

183
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:25,377
No, uh, you go upstairs and lay down.
You're all wore out.

184
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,088
I'll ask Jessie to come over
and pick up the nuts.

185
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,632
All right.

186
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:36,972
After all, it is Jessie's
pie, isn't it?

187
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:50,069
(TAPPING)

188
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,536
No, I don't want to. Mama, no!

189
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,874
Marnie, wake up. Marnie?

190
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,419
Don't make me move, Mama.
It's too cold.

191
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,172
Wake up, Marnie.
You're still dreaming.

192
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:14,009
- Get washed up. Supper's ready.
- Oh.

193
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:20,766
I was having that old dream again.
First the tapping and then...

194
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,018
I said, supper's ready.

195
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,730
It's always when
you come to the door.

196
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,276
That's when the cold starts.

197
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,039
- Miss Clabon.
- Good morning.

198
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,499
Is Mr. Ward in his office?

199
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,876
Yes, Mr. Rutland. He's interviewing
for the new office assistant.

200
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,546
Rutland & Company is an old
established publishing...

201
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:18,384
Oh, Mr. Rutland. This is
Miss Blakely, Mr. Rutland.

202
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,721
Well, you'll hear from us,
Miss Blakely, I'm sure.

203
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,765
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you for your time, Mr. Ward.

204
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:28,060
- Good day, Mr. Rutland.
- Good day, Miss Blakely.

205
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:32,398
Well, I guess that does it. She seems
to have the exact qualifications...

206
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,821
Come in. Come in for
a moment, please.

207
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:52,042
- WARD: Now, sit down, Mrs. Taylor.
- Thank you.

208
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:56,630
WARD: I have here your
Pittsburgh references.

209
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,717
Reference, that is.
Kendall's, yes.

210
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,886
This the only reference
you have to show us?

211
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,930
MARNIE: Well, Mr. Ward,
I have good training,

212
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,057
but I've had very
little actual experience.

213
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,101
Kendall's was my
first real job.

214
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,186
After I finished school,
I was married.

215
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:15,274
My husband was a CPA and he helped
me keep up with my training.

216
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,359
I learnt a great
deal more from him,

217
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:20,529
accounting, cost-price, even
something about computers.

218
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,780
WARD: I see.

219
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:24,825
When my husband died
very suddenly last November,

220
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:29,204
well, he left me a little money,
but I felt I needed work.

221
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,498
Good, hard, demanding work.

222
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,751
I got the job at Kendall's,
but it was...

223
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:37,045
Well, it wasn't
a very exacting position,

224
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,006
and there didn't
seem much immediate

225
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,008
chance for anything
else at Kendall's.

226
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,301
Oh, I don't mean pay.

227
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,094
Salary isn't the most
important thing with me,

228
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,889
but more interesting work,
Mr. Ward.

229
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:50,434
Something that will
keep me busy, occupied.

230
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,646
Well, I don't care how much work
I'm given or what hours I work.

231
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:58,066
WARD: Uh, but, Mrs. Taylor,
why did you leave Pittsburgh?

232
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,277
Well, after my
husband died, I just...

233
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,822
Now, Mrs. Taylor, this is a
post of some confidence.

234
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:07,451
Oh, please, let me have a chance
to prove myself, Mr. Ward.

235
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:17,544
Uh, very well, Mrs. Taylor.

236
00:22:17,629 --> 00:22:21,006
I suppose you might as well
report to work on Monday.

237
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:27,054
Our Miss Clabon in the outer
office will brief you.

238
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,559
I'll be out in just a moment.

239
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,062
Now, why are we taking on someone
without the proper references?

240
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,355
You're always
such a stickler...

241
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:40,108
Let's just say I'm an interested
spectator in the passing parade.

242
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,777
I don't get it.

243
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,821
You're not supposed
to get it.

244
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,369
- Hi, Miss Clabon.
- Fine, fortunately...

245
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,955
Hello, Mr. Sam.
How's the curmudgeon business?

246
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,832
WARD: Oh, Miss Mainwaring!

247
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,834
Is Mark in there?
I'm looking for a free lunch

248
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,962
and somebody to
cash a check for me.

249
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,548
I thought I'd stick Mark for the
lunch and you for the cash.

250
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:04,258
Go right on in.

251
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,761
WARD: You have your social
security card, Mrs. Taylor?

252
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,805
MARNIE: Yes, of course.
It's right here in my purse.

253
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,890
Who's the dish?

254
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,769
Miss Clabon will
show you around.

255
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,563
She's been with
us for seven years.

256
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:20,816
I believe she's found
the work exacting enough.

257
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,151
Good day, Mrs. Taylor. Miss
Clabon, will you call Personnel

258
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,486
and have them
send the forms up?

259
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,405
Certainly, Mr. Ward.

260
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,247
MISS CLABON: Hello.
This is Mr. Ward's office.

261
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:39,293
Would you please send up a W-4 and
the rest of the employment forms?

262
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:42,421
Yes, before lunch.
I'll wait. Thank you.

263
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,425
Maud, what about Saturday?

264
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:51,346
No, I only thought as you said
your mother wasn't coming with us,

265
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,808
I just wanted to make sure
about our reservations.

266
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,854
Well, why don't you
call me back?

267
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,772
All right. Any time.

268
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:09,656
Thanks, Mr. Sam. I'll try not to
do anything sensible with it.

269
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,202
- Bye, Miss Clabon.
- Bye.

270
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:18,040
That's Lil Mainwaring,
Mr. Rutland's sister-in-law.

271
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,126
- Her sister was Mr. Rutland's wife.
- Was?

272
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,463
Yes. She died about a year and a half ago.
Some kind of heart thing.

273
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,506
Imagine. Only 29.

274
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,052
Well, anyway,
she kind of brought Lil up.

275
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,305
Lil lived with them and old
Mr. Rutland down at Wykwyn.

276
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,392
I get the feeling little old Lil
plans to stay on permanently.

277
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:42,708
Anyway, like I was saying, old
Mr. Rutland, that's Mark's father,

278
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,627
they say he's never even been
inside this place.

279
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,295
And the company
was really headed

280
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:49,047
into the ground
when Mark took over.

281
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:52,134
They say the first week
he was here he retired...

282
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,720
(CHUCKLES)
Retired. Three board members,

283
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,055
the acting president,
the president's secretary,

284
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,224
and the secretary's secretary.

285
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,143
Coffee time, ladies.

286
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:07,274
Would you mind
bringing me a cup?

287
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,276
Just coffee? Doughnut,
Danish?

288
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:13,655
- Oh, lady, have I got for you a Danish!
- No, just coffee.

289
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,198
Oh, I'm out of red ink.

290
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,825
Oh, here, use mine.

291
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,494
- Oh, I'll get it.
- No, no, I will.

292
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,332
Thanks.

293
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:49,024
Mrs. Taylor, are you hurt?
Mrs. Taylor!

294
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,069
I think she's hurt. Find out.

295
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,364
Mary, are you all right?

296
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:59,576
What?

297
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,662
Of course, I'm all right. I just
spilled a little ink on my blouse.

298
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,122
The way you rushed
out of the office...

299
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,624
Mr. Rutland's
standing out there.

300
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,210
- He said he thought you were hurt.
- Well, I'm not.

301
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:11,797
All that happened was I spilled
a little ink on my blouse.

302
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,883
Good heavens. What a lot of
excitement over nothing.

303
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:42,661
(PHONE RINGING)

304
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,460
Why in the world does he keep
locking and unlocking that drawer?

305
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,587
He never can remember
the safe combination.

306
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,047
It's kept locked
up in that drawer.

307
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,968
Mr. Rutland and I have the keys
to it, too, for emergencies.

308
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,971
It's only five numbers,
for Pete's sake.

309
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:07,435
Mrs. Taylor? I've just had a call
from Mr. Rutland, Mrs. Taylor.

310
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:11,857
He remembered your saying you'd
be willing to work overtime.

311
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:14,526
He wondered if you'd be
prepared to work on Saturday?

312
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:17,946
- Saturday? Of course, Mr. Ward. What time?
- 2:30.

313
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,950
I'll advise Mr. Rutland
that you are available.

314
00:28:51,522 --> 00:28:53,148
(THUNDER CRACKING)

315
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,837
MARK: Come in, Mrs. Taylor.

316
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,176
Good afternoon, Mr. Rutland.

317
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,392
Are you interested in
pre-Columbian art, Mrs. Taylor?

318
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,395
Those were collected
by my wife. She's dead.

319
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:35,065
The only things
of hers I've kept.

320
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:38,234
And that's Sophie.

321
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:43,198
She's a jaguarondi. South American.
I, uh, trained her.

322
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:46,201
Oh? What did you train
her to do?

323
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,953
To trust me.

324
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:49,996
Is that all?

325
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:53,124
Well, that's a great
deal for a jaguarondi.

326
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:58,004
Shall we get to work? You can
use the typewriter over there.

327
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:00,298
I want an original
and one copy of this.

328
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,634
If you can't decipher
any of it, speak up.

329
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,054
I typed it myself and I'm
a very creative typist.

330
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,981
"Arboreal Predators
of the Brazilian Rain Forest."

331
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,234
Before I was drafted
into Rutland's, Mrs. Taylor,

332
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,277
I had notions of
being a zoologist.

333
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:24,489
- I still try to keep up with my field.
- Zoos?

334
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,659
Instinctual behavior.

335
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,743
Oh.

336
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,955
Does zoology include people,
Mr. Rutland?

337
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,833
Well, in a way. It includes
all the animal ancestors

338
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,460
from whom man
derived his instincts.

339
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,379
Ladies' instincts, too?

340
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:43,049
Well, that paper deals with
the instincts of predators.

341
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:46,386
What you might call the criminal
class of the animal world.

342
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,639
Lady animals figure
very largely as predators.

343
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,609
(THUNDER CRACKING)

344
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:12,037
Put on the overhead light if you like.
The switch is by the door.

(THUNDER CRACKING)

346
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:29,387
Why don't you sit down,
Mrs. Taylor?

347
00:31:29,472 --> 00:31:33,641
If the storm worries you that much,
I'll get you something to drink.

348
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:36,853
Mrs. Taylor?

349
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,493
The building is grounded,
Mrs. Taylor.

350
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,040
You're quite safe here,

351
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:00,919
from the lightning.

352
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,718
- The colors. Stop the colors.
- What colors?

353
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:51,302
It's over. All over.
You're all right.

354
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:54,222
Okay, now?

355
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,141
Would you like something to drink?
Some brandy?

356
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,893
No, thank you.
I'm awfully sorry. I...

357
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:03,273
Oh, don't be silly. What is it
about colors that bothers you?

358
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,735
- Colors? - Mmm. You seem
to be terrified of some colors.

359
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,573
No, no. What I'm terrified of
is thunder and lightning.

360
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:17,787
You know, I wouldn't have pegged you for
a woman who'd be terrified of anything.

361
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,595
Well, we've all
got to go some time.

362
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,682
Look, this place is wrecked and
you're in no state to work.

363
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,059
Suppose I drive you home. You can
do this job some other time.

364
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:43,104
- Oh, thank you. I...
- Go get your things.

365
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:51,279
It's cold and damp here. I must
get the maintenance people in.

366
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:11,382
I'm really sorry
about the cabinet.

367
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,301
Why should you be?

368
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,846
You said it was all you
had left of your wife.

369
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:20,016
I said it was all I had left
that had belonged to my wife.

370
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
Oh.

ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: <i>Native Winkler
is second. Hopeless is third.</i>

372
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,566
Oh, no, please.
I'd like to hear.

373
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:33,738
- You like racing? - I like horses.
I go to the races when I can.

374
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,825
- Was your husband a track fan?
- Yes.

375
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,828
- And you go alone now?
- Yes.

376
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,667
Atlantic City track's open
till the end of the month.

377
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,544
We could drive out
there next Saturday.

378
00:34:49,046 --> 00:34:53,341
- All right. Are you fond of horses?
- No, not at all.

00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,788
Well, that's another one.

382
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,833
Oh, I like it here like this.

383
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:31,379
Well, you're the expert. What
do you like in the next race?

384
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,257
Lemon Pudding. He's finished
third his last three times out.

385
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:37,593
- He's got a good jockey up today.
- Lemon Pudding it is.

386
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,471
The morning line
says he's four to one.

387
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,265
I'll get on him.

388
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,690
Pardon me, but you're
Peggy Nicholson, aren't you?

389
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,484
Remember me?

390
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,404
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

391
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,906
I said,
aren't you Peggy Nicholson?

392
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,408
No, I'm not.

393
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,620
Yeah? I was pretty sure you were. You
know, when I first saw you down here...

394
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:08,082
No, I'm sorry, you've made a mistake.
I am not Miss Nichols.

395
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,293
- Nicholson.
- Nicholson.

396
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:14,922
Frank Abernathy introduced us
a couple years ago in Detroit.

397
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,926
Frank Abernathy.
You remember Frank.

398
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,929
No, I do not know anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

399
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:25,266
I have never known anyone
named Frank Abernathy.

400
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,269
- Now, will you please go?
- Oh, come on now, honey,

401
00:36:28,354 --> 00:36:30,605
you're trying to
pull my leg, aren't you?

402
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,691
Now, why should any young lady
want to pull your leg?

403
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:37,111
Oh, sorry. I thought
I recognized this lady.

404
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,072
- Did he recognize you?
- No.

405
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:40,907
You did not recognize her.

406
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:44,118
I said, I thought I recognized her.
I said I'm sorry.

407
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:48,206
Well, good for you. You've apologized
nicely. You may go now.

408
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:56,631
- You came back so quickly.
- Yes. Who's your fan?

409
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,592
You know, I just seem to
have one of those faces.

410
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,803
Well, what do you
like in the next race?

411
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:04,555
Can we go to the paddock?
I'd like to see Telepathy.

412
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,060
Been watching him ever since I saw
him work out once as a two-year-old.

413
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:35,837
Oh, I believe that's our
old friend Telepathy.

414
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,297
Yeah, number 8. Telepathy.

415
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:49,642
He's a lanky-looking piece of business
but I bow to your superior knowledge.

416
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,352
What is it?
What's the matter?

417
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,771
- Don't bet him.
- Why not?

418
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:56,983
He's walleyed.
Can we go now?

419
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:15,084
What a paragon you are. You
don't smoke, drink or gamble.

420
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:19,505
- Just this once, for luck.
- I don't believe in luck.

421
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,758
- What do you believe in?
- Nothing.

422
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,428
Oh, horses, maybe.

423
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:29,682
At least they're beautiful and
nothing in this world like people.

424
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:33,060
- Oh, yes, people. Thoroughly bad lot.
- Generally.

425
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,355
Did you have a tough
childhood, Mrs. Taylor?

426
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,191
Not particularly.

427
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:43,196
I think you did. I think you've
had a hard, tough climb.

428
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,615
But you're a smart girl,
aren't you?

429
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,284
The careful grammar,
the quiet good manners.

430
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,412
- Where did you learn them?
- From my betters.

431
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,500
What about your tough
childhood, Mr. Rutland?

432
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:58,961
The old, sad story.
Promising youth blighted.

433
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:02,757
Dragged down by money,
position, noblesse oblige.

434
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:07,386
By the time I came along, the
company was hanging on the ropes.

435
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:10,640
We had about a thousand employees who
were about to go down for the count.

436
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:13,935
What about the Rutlands? What
would've happened to your family?

437
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,646
Nothing ever happens to a family
that traditionally marries

438
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,273
at least one heiress
every other generation.

439

(CROWD CHEERING)

440
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,319
Well, you shouldn't
have chickened.

441
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:26,447
Your walleyed reject
just won by four lengths.

442
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:33,454
- I think I've had enough. Can we go?
- Well, if you like.

443
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,998
See here. The track's open
till the end of the month.

444
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:39,126
That gives us
two more Saturdays.

445
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:43,256
If your luck holds out, by this time
next month, I'll be a rich man.

446
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:56,561
- Oh, Miss Nicholson. - You really
are pressing your luck, old boy.

447
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,445
Where are we going this time?

448
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,116
I thought it was time I brought
you home to meet my old man.

449
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,411
- Oh, you should've told me.
- You're all right.

450
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:17,081
Dad goes by scent. If you smell
anything like a horse, you're in.

451
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:38,477
Here we are, old bean.
The homestead.

452
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,953
- Hello, Dad.
- Who's this?

453
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:57,997
This is Mary Taylor.
Mary, this is my father.

454
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,333
- How do you do, Mr. Rutland?
- A girl, is it?

455
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:03,836
Oh, it's all right, Dad. She's not
really a girl, she's a horse-fancier.

456
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,921
Now that the track's closed, I
thought if I brought her round

457
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:08,507
to see your horses, I'd hold
her attention a bit longer.

458
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:10,009
Splendid, splendid!

459
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:13,929
Come along, my dear. I was just
about to have a cup of tea.

460
00:41:20,187 --> 00:41:23,022
Oh, Mary, this is my
sister-in-law, Lil Mainwaring.

461
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,274
- Mary Taylor.
- How do you do?

462
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,526
Hi. I've seen you at
Rutland's, haven't I?

463
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:31,489
RUTLAND: It bewilders me what any
of you can find to do at Rutland's.

464
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,663
Oh, dear! I think I rather
sprained my wrist this afternoon.

465
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,874
There's sure to be
droppage and spillage.

466
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:44,001
Would you mind awfully?

467
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:48,964
RUTLAND: Strong, please.
No milk, two lumps of sugar.

468
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,133
The meals in this
house are shocking bad,

469
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:54,679
but I do insist on good
Horn & Hardart cake at tea.

470
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:57,723
You take yours with lemon,
don't you, Lil?

471
00:41:58,517 --> 00:42:00,643
Yes. Lemon for Lil, Mary.

472
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,815
- Strong with a dash of rum for me.
- RUTLAND: Spinster's tea.

473
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:09,819
Mucking up tea with strong drink.
Something sneaky about it, eh?

474
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:11,987
What's your opinion,
Miss Taylor?

475
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:14,490
Do you think old Mark
here is a sneaky one?

476
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:16,826
Possibly.

477
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,539
How do you take
your tea, Miss Taylor?

478
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:24,208
Usually with a cup
of hot water and a tea bag.

479
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,293
RUTLAND: Lazy habit, my dear.

480
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:29,588
I'll have quite a large slice
of that butter cake, please.

481
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,882
- Do you ride, Miss Taylor?
- A little.

482
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,593
RUTLAND: Best thing in the world
for the inside of a man or a woman

483
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:36,804
is the outside of a horse.

484
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:39,348
I shouldn't think you'd find
old Mark very interesting.

485
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:40,766
Doesn't hunt.
Doesn't even ride.

486
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:43,894
Please, Dad. I was hoping to
lead up gently to all that.

487
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,564
I'd even planned
to show her the horses first.

488
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,608
Swill that down or bring it
with you to the stables.

489
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:52,820
Mark's trying to behave as if he brought
Miss Taylor out to see the horses.

490
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,240
- He really brought her to see me.
- Really? Whatever for?

491
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,452
RUTLAND: Showing off. I'm quite a
presentable old party, you know.

492
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:03,622
Lil, I'm sure your sturdy young
wrist has recovered sufficiently

493
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,374
to pour Dad
another cup of tea.

494
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:07,752
- Yes, I will have another cup.
- I can't!

495
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:10,379
"When Duty whispers low,
Thou must.

496
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:12,757
"Then youth replies, I can."

497
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,595
Ratfink! And you misquoted!

498
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:47,792
Will you come out and spend
next weekend with us?

499
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:51,670
You can bring your tea bag,
have your pick of the horses.

500
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,095
Good night, Mary. I have to run.
See you on Monday.

501
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,430
Good night, Susan.

502
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:03,599
WOMAN: Good night!
See you Monday.

503
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,895
SECOND WOMAN:
Good night. See you on Monday.

504
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,707
I haven't got my powder puff.
Have you got one?

505
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:30,167
Yeah, here.

506
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:32,586
- WOMAN: Come on.
- SECOND WOMAN: Wait a minute.

507
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:36,257
- Come on.
- All right, I'm coming.

508
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,802
You mean you just have to hang
around and wait until he calls?

509
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:42,263
- Good night, girls.
- Good night. I'll see you.

510
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,014
- I think that's...
- Have a good weekend.

511
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,641
Yeah, I think that's...

512
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,895
- What are you gonna do?
- Well, I don't know. Let's get home.

513
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,647
- Because he may have already called you.
- Oh, well.

514
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:53,107
If I miss his call,
that's the way it goes.

515
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,651
Oh, this is
the best one you've had!

516
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:56,944
(DOOR CLOSING)

517
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,210
WOMAN: See you next week.

518
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:53,722
You're sure making time tonight, Rita.
What's the big rush?

519
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:56,809
I want to get to bed.
That's the big rush.

520
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:32,845
Please get down.

521
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:36,390
You'll walk back to
the stables. I'll ride.

522
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:42,020
Are you staying at an inn or have
you friends among the local gentry?

523
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:44,898
- You said you didn't trust horses.
- I don't, but they trust me.

524
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:48,569
Which brings us directly to
our relationship, Miss Edgar!

525
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,749
Is Edgar your real name?
And you're blonde.

526
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:04,626
You'll save
a good deal of time

527
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,546
and make for a better feeling all
round if you just tell me the truth.

528
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,631
Is Edgar your real name?

529
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:11,592
Now, don't crowd me, lady!

530
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:15,596
I'm fighting a powerful impulse
to beat the hell out of you.

531
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,140
At last we communicate.

532
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:21,476
Now, for the third and last
time, is Edgar your real name?

533
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:24,146
And don't bother to lie to me. I'll
check you out in every detail.

534
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,398
Yes, Edgar. Margaret Edgar!

535
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,026
Now, where are you from?

536
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:31,486
- California.
- Where in California?

537
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:33,155
Los Angeles.

538
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,032
Where's the money?

539
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,286
Here! Some of it.

540
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,997
- Where's the rest?
- Oh, don't worry. It's safe.

541
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,082
Safe? At some
pari-mutuel window?

542
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,251
Or has it gone for an operation
for your old sick mother?

543
00:50:46,336 --> 00:50:49,254
Or perhaps you're putting your
kid brother through school?

544
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:52,174
I don't have a kid brother or a mother.
I don't have anybody.

545
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:53,675
Not even Mr. Taylor?

546
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,428
You know, I wouldn't be a bit surprised
to hear that the rest of the haul

547
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,680
is with your late husband,
Mr. Taylor.

548
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:02,684
Somewhere around these parts, I expect
to find him happily reincarnated,

549
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:06,021
and the pockets of his good blue burial
suit bulging with Rutland money.

550
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,107
The rest of the money is in a
registered package addressed to me

551
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:10,901
in a post office
box in New York.

552
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,904
You can pick it up there by tomorrow.
Here's the key.

553
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:17,991
Thank you, Miss Edgar. Now I'll
take the registration receipt.

554
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,747
This receipt and the unopened package
are as good as a signed confession.

555
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,374
You understand that?

556
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,834
All right. Now, where
does Mr. Taylor come in?

557
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:30,379
There's no such person.
I've never been married.

558
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:32,714
Mrs. Taylor was an old
friend of my mother's.

559
00:51:32,799 --> 00:51:34,341
And when you
applied at Rutland's,

560
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:36,093
the name just
came to your mind.

561
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:39,763
I was trying to get away from someone.
I have a cousin Jessie. She's no good.

562
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:43,100
I was afraid if she found out
about the insurance money,

563
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:45,394
she'd try to get a part of it.
Make trouble for me.

564
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:48,230
What insurance money?

565
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:52,276
- Mrs. Taylor's. She died.
- Oh, Mrs. Taylor died. Pity.

566
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,778
Now you're working with
this naughty cousin Jessie.

567
00:51:54,862 --> 00:51:56,697
Nobody's working with me!

568
00:51:56,781 --> 00:52:00,075
You talk as if this was some
kind of regular thing I do, did.

569
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,743
All planned out
in cold blood.

570
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:03,870
- And it wasn't?
- No!

571
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:07,082
You're not from Los Angeles,
Miss Edgar.

572
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,459
Insurance is only pronounced
"insurance" in the South,

573
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:12,337
and that's where you're from.
Where? Around here?

574
00:52:12,422 --> 00:52:15,257
You're a cold, practiced little
method actress of a liar.

575
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:17,718
- I can't help it.
- It would appear not.

576
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,511
I don't mean that.

577
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:23,807
I mean, I wasn't born in California.
I was born in Richmond, Virginia.

578
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:26,226
My father deserted
us when I was a baby.

579
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:29,521
My mother and I lived in
Richmond until I was seven.

580
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,648
And then we
moved to California,

581
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,026
where Mother could get work
in the airplane factories.

582
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:35,944
That's the truth. I swear it!

583
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,449
My mother died when I was 10, and
Mrs. Taylor took care of me out there.

584
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,784
Come on, get moving.

585
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,204
How did you find me?

586
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:49,374
You're here to answer
the questions, old girl.

587
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:51,752
Now how did you get the
combination to Ward's safe?

588
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,463
I took Susan's
key from her purse.

589
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,340
I see.

590
00:52:56,424 --> 00:52:59,509
Now, suppose you just
begin at the beginning.

591
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:05,265
It's just like I told you. I was
born in Richmond. We were poor.

592
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:08,101
We were grindingly poor.

593
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:15,275
I was so horribly
alone after Mother died.

594
00:53:15,985 --> 00:53:18,945
Well, go on.
You still have my attention.

595
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:24,618
I just went to school and took care
of Mrs. Taylor until she died.

596
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:30,123
She left me her house
and $5,000 in insurance.

597
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:38,465
I sold the house. It had a mortgage
so I only got $9,000 cash.

598
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:46,056
But there I was with $14,000. Me! I could
do exactly what I wanted to with it.

599
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,353
- There isn't much more. I bought Forio.
- Forio?

600
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:55,857
My horse at Garrod's.
I had two wonderful years.

601
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:59,528
Then last November it was all
gone so I had to get a job.

602
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:01,655
I went to Pittsburgh
and got the job at Kendall's

603
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,657
until I could look around
for something better.

604
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,784
All right, let's try again.

605
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:10,997
Let's back up and see if you can turn that
Mount Everest of manure into a few facts.

606
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,916
One, your dates
are all wrong.

607
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,877
Previously you were employed by
the firm of Strutt & Company.

608
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,838
I saw you there once.

609
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:21,800
Mr. Strutt is the tax consultant
for Rutland & Company.

610
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:24,678
He pointed you out to me
and you were a brunette then.

611
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:28,557
And then some months later
he pointed out your absence.

612
00:54:28,683 --> 00:54:31,226
You mean, you knew all about
that when you hired me?

613
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:32,936
No. I wasn't positive.

614
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,857
But I thought it might be
interesting to keep you around.

615
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:41,445
And all this time you've been
trying to trip me up, trap me!

616
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:47,576
Um, I'm not sure anymore. I think
I was just curious at first.

617
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:52,372
And then things got out of
control and I liked you.

618
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,082
So I see!

619
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,419
Incidentally, I think
you took a bit of a chance,

620
00:54:57,545 --> 00:55:01,673
knowing that Rutland's
was a client of Strutt's.

621
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,468
I didn't. My job at Strutt's
didn't give me access

622
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,720
to all the clients' names!

623
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,390
All right. Let's get on.

624
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:13,393
We've established that
you're a thief and a liar.

625
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:15,270
Now, what is the degree?

626
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:18,356
Are you a compulsive thief?
A pathological liar?

627
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:21,234
- Oh, what difference does it make?
- Some.

628
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,738
It makes some
difference to me.

629
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:32,704
Have you ever been in jail?

630
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:34,414
Certainly not.

631
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:39,961
I know you'll never believe
me now and it's my own fault.

632
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:44,090
It's true about Strutt.
I did it. I don't know why.

633
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:49,179
I just kind of went crazy, I guess,
but old Mr. Strutt was so...

634
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:50,472
Oh, I hated him!

635
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,183
Like you hate me?

636
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,645
Oh, no, not you.

637
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:07,197
Clean up your face.

638
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,204
Come on.

639
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:45,443
Good afternoon.

640
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:58,582
- What'll you folks have?
- A frank and a coffee, please.

641
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:00,792
- Same for me.
- Okey-doke.

642
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:05,005
Let's get on with
that little discussion.

643
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,717
The chronic use of an alias is
not consistent with your story

644
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:12,679
of sudden temptation
and unpremeditated impulse.

645
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:18,018
If you'd stolen almost $10,000,
wouldn't you change your name?

646
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,980
Oh, what's the use? Why should I
even try to make you understand?

647
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,733
I'm not only trying to understand
you, I'm even trying to believe you.

648
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:27,360
- Why?
- Because, damn it, I want to.

649
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,696
Can you understand that?

650
00:57:30,823 --> 00:57:32,699
Here you are, folks.

651
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:35,076
Mark?

652
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,373
The reasons for what
I did at Rutland's,

653
00:57:41,751 --> 00:57:45,211
they were so mixed up,
what I wanted to say before.

654
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:51,843
I needed to get away, can't you see?
Away from Rutland's.

655
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:57,015
Don't you understand?
Things were... We were...

656
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,726
So we were. Was that any
reason to run away?

657
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:02,270
Yes, I thought it was time
I got out before I got hurt.

658
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,689
I mean, why try
to kid myself?

659
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:07,734
- Are you called Margaret?
- Marnie.

660
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:13,663
Oh, God, Mark, if you let me go, I swear...

661
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:15,700
I can't let you go, Marnie.

662
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:19,412
Somebody's got to take care of you and
help you. I can't just turn you loose.

663
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:23,833
If I let you go, I'm criminally
and morally responsible.

664
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:25,669
Well, then, what...

665
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:29,089
Marnie. Yeah, that suits you.

666
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:35,011
All right, Marnie,
this is how it's gonna be.

667
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:37,847
I'm driving you
back to Philadelphia.

668
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:41,017
Tonight we'll go to the house.
Tomorrow you'll return to Rutland's.

669
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:44,771
You'll see that Susan's key finds
its way back into her purse.

670
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:46,773
How can I go
back to Rutland's?

671
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:49,567
You're covered.
I replaced the money.

672
00:58:50,778 --> 00:58:53,446
When I called to pick you up yesterday
and found you'd pulled out,

673
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,949
I knew instantly
what had happened.

674
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:58,785
So I went to Rutland's
and checked Ward's safe.

675
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:01,788
Figured the loss
and replaced it.

676
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,124
Then I set out to find you.

677
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,458
Remember that
first day at the races

678
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:08,962
when you were so hot about
a horse called Telepathy?

679
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:12,215
I remember, you'd said you'd watched
him training as a two-year-old.

680
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,801
That's all I had to go on,
so I looked him up,

681
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:19,222
and found he'd been bred by a
Colonel Marston of Virginia.

682
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,391
I phoned Marston and asked him

683
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:24,644
if there was anywhere around there
that they had horses for hire.

684
00:59:24,729 --> 00:59:27,564
He gave me the names of three.

685
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:30,984
Yesterday I drove up to the plains,
checked out the stables. No luck.

686
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:34,988
But at the last place, the man
said why didn't I try Garrod's,

687
00:59:35,114 --> 00:59:36,948
over by Middleburg?

688
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:40,994
You folks be sure
and come back now.

689
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,915
Why are you taking
me back to Wykwyn?

690
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,501
Because I don't trust
you not to run away.

691
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:50,754
How can I run away?

692
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:54,758
You have the receipt,
the post office key, my name.

693
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:58,511
Margaret Edgar. You sure
that's all the name you have?

694
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:00,472
You sure you haven't misplaced
an old husband or two

695
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:04,267
- somewhere in your travels?
- I told you I've never been married.

696
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,269
- Near misses?
- No.

697
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:10,982
And no lovers, no steadies, no beaus,
no gentlemen callers, nothing!

698
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:13,610
Okay. Eat up.

699
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:20,867
- Mark, I'd like to go freshen up a little.
- Uh-uh.

700
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:23,328
You're fresh enough. Come on.

701
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,216
You know, I can't
believe you, Marnie.

702
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:39,135
There must've been a great
many men interested in you.

703
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,095
I didn't say men
weren't interested in me.

704
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:43,139
I said I wasn't
interested in them.

705
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:44,682
- Never?
- No.

706
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,395
That is, not until...

707
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,856
Why me?

708
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:55,318
Because you were
different, Mark.

709
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,071
It won't wash, Marnie.

710
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,740
But it's true.
I really liked you.

711
01:01:02,034 --> 01:01:03,660
Yes, I think you did.

712
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:06,996
But don't try to make it sound
like any more than that.

713
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:11,668
When we get home, I'll explain
that we had a lover's quarrel.

714
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:15,088
That you ran away, that I went
after you and brought you back.

715
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:18,007
That'll please Dad.
He admires action.

716
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:22,428
Then I'll explain that we're gonna
be married before the week is out,

717
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:24,347
therefore you
should stay on at Wykwyn.

718
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:26,850
That I can't bear
to have you out of my sight.

719
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:30,520
He also admires
wholesome animal lust.

720
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,189
We'll be married just as
soon as the law allows.

721
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:35,358
We'll catch an outbound boat.

722
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,861
Where do you want to go? You
ever been to the South Seas?

723
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:40,238
What are you trying to pull?

724
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:45,118
I'm trying to pull a proposal.
Let's see, how shall I phrase it?

725
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:48,121
How about "will you be mine"?

726
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:50,164
You're crazy!
You're out of your mind!

727
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:52,250
That's a possibility.

728
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,628
The name Marnie. Yes, I'll
just go on calling you Marnie.

729
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:58,298
That's easily explained.
Pet name.

730
01:01:58,424 --> 01:02:00,300
But the Taylor...

731
01:02:00,426 --> 01:02:03,636
We'll just have to marry you off as
Mary Taylor. It's perfectly legal.

732
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:07,223
You can sign yourself Minnie Q
Mouse on a marriage license,

733
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:09,058
you're still legally married.

734
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:10,894
But you know what I am.

735
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:14,230
I'm Minnie Q Thief!
I'm a thief and a liar and...

736
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:19,277
Well, it seems to be my misfortune to have
fallen in love with a thief and a liar.

737
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:20,820
In love?

738
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,742
Oh, Mark, if you love me,
you'll let me go.

739
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:28,745
Just let me go, Mark, please.

740
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,664
Mark, you don't know me.

741
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:39,088
Oh, listen to me, Mark. I am not
like other people. I know what I am!

742
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:40,590
I doubt that you do, Marnie.

743
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:44,510
In any event, we'll just have to deal
with whatever it is that you are.

744
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,930
Whatever you are, I love you.

745
01:02:48,307 --> 01:02:51,309
It's horrible, I know.
But I do love you.

746
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:56,940
You don't love me. I'm just
something you've caught.

747
01:02:57,024 --> 01:03:00,026
You think I'm some kind
of animal you've trapped.

748
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,778
That's right, you are.

749
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:05,531
And I've caught something really
wild this time, haven't I?

750
01:03:05,658 --> 01:03:09,202
I've tracked you and caught you,
and by God, I'm gonna keep you!

751
01:03:09,328 --> 01:03:11,037
Oh, and, Marnie,
when we get home,

752
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:14,457
no cute ideas about absconding
with the Wykwyn silver.

753
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,376
Just get a grip on yourself
for one short week

754
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,045
and after that, well, you
can take legal possession.

755
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:22,674
Like you? Like you
take legal possession?

756
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:26,886
Yes, if you want
to put it that way.

757
01:03:26,971 --> 01:03:30,056
Somebody's got to take on the
responsibility for you, Marnie.

758
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:34,227
And it narrows down to a choice
of me or the police, old girl.

759
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,369
RUTLAND: Indispensable.
(CHUCKLING)

760
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:55,164
Ah, Cousin Bob, I almost forgot.
Do you have the old necessary?

761
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:57,458
- Have fun, my dear.
- Traveler's checks in this.

762
01:03:57,543 --> 01:03:59,919
- Letter of credit in this.
- Thanks, old man.

763
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:03,131
Will you see about having my
car picked up at the airport?

764
01:04:03,215 --> 01:04:06,426
Bob is our banking cousin.
A very handy fellow.

765
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:14,392
Take care, Lil.
We'll send you a noble savage.

766
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:15,810
- Goodbye, Dad.
- Bye, Mark.

767
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,980
Thank you, Dr. Gillian. Without
you it wouldn't have been legal.

768
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:20,982
It's been a pleasure.

769
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,000
RUTLAND: Let's go back
and finish the champagne

770
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:31,534
and cake before they spirit it away.

771
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:35,288
Really splendid cake, you know?
I attended to that myself.

772
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:38,958
I've made the acquaintance of one of those
excellent Horn & Hardart executives.

773
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:43,212
That engagement ring must have
been at least five carats.

774
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:47,508
Six and a half. Blue-white.
Perfect stone.

775
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:49,218
His mother left
perfectly good jewelry.

776
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:51,721
It's just sitting there at
the bank in safety deposit.

777
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:55,725
He said he wanted her to have something
that had never belonged to anyone else.

778
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:58,019
But six and a half carats!

779
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,105
And cashing in a bond
to pay for a ring.

780
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:05,610
But he didn't pay for it. He charged it.
I helped him pick it out.

781
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:10,114
It cost $42,000, plus tax.

782
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:12,909
Did you say $42,000?

783
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,287
The man's deranged.

784
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,748
BOB: You know what he did
to me last Saturday?

785
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:23,002
He came out to the club
waving a check for $7,000

786
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:26,172
and insisted that I break up my
golf game, go in and open the bank

787
01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:29,175
and hand over to him $7,000.

788
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,094
Then he drew out...

789
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:35,431
Well, let's just say enough to pay for
this trip plus the letter of credit.

790
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,852
He cashed that very nice bond
against my advice,

791
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:42,939
made me get him the money.
$10,000 in small bills.

792
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:46,776
And when I asked him why he wanted
$10,000 in small bills, he said,

793
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:51,364
"Well, old man, I'm being blackmailed
and they specified small bills."

794
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:55,368
I know that most people find
Mark's humor charming.

795
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:59,831
I do not. There is nothing
charming about running through,

796
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:05,378
including the unpaid
bill for a ring,

797
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:08,798
approximately
$70,000 in one week.

798
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:14,470
A $6,000 or $7,000 South Seas
honeymoon, conservatively speaking,

799
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:16,973
and a $42,000 ring.

800
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:20,351
All that money
spent to celebrate what?

801
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:23,312
This meager,
furtive little wedding?

802
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:24,856
He didn't even ask Mother.

803
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:18,576
"Pay off Strutt."

804
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:21,537
Strutt.

805
01:07:59,451 --> 01:08:00,660
Booze?

806
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:03,829
Shall I fix you a drink?

807
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:15,174
Would you like some bourbon
to brush your teeth?

808
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,842
MARNIE: No, thank you.

809
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:23,849
Contrary to the movies
and the <i>Ladies' Home Journal,</i>

810
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:29,522
the battleground of marriage is
not, I repeat, not the bedroom.

811
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:33,317
The real field of
battle is the bath.

812
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,611
It is in the bath
and for the bath

813
01:08:35,696 --> 01:08:38,864
that the lines are drawn
and no quarter given.

814
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:42,702
It seems to me, we are getting off to
a dangerously poor start, darling.

815
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:45,997
You've been in the bathroom
exactly 47 minutes.

816
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:51,877
- You can have the bath now.
- Thank you.

817
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:57,049
You're very sexy
with your face clean.

818
01:08:59,553 --> 01:09:01,387
Marnie, come here.

819
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:13,733
Sit down.

820
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,041
I can't! I can't! I can't!

821
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,418
For God's sakes, Marnie!

822
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:38,674
I can't stand it. I'll die. If
you touch me again, I'll die!

823
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:44,347
I won't touch you.
I promise I won't touch you.

824
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:47,433
Just get out of that
damn corner, please.

825
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:52,605
Now, suppose you tell me
what this is all about.

826
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,192
Is it your own little way of saying you
don't find me particularly attractive?

827
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,611
I told you not to marry me.
I told you!

828
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:01,614
Oh, God, why couldn't you
have just let me go?

829
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:05,284
- Marnie.
- Don't. Please, don't!

830
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:08,287
- Let me fix you a drink.
- I don't want a drink.

831
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,374
- At least have a brandy.
- I don't want it. Just leave me alone.

832
01:10:11,458 --> 01:10:14,460
Not till I find out what's the matter
with you and find some way to help you.

833
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:18,047
The only way you can help me
is to leave me alone!

834
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,549
Can't you understand?
Isn't it plain enough?

835
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:22,593
I cannot bear to be handled!

836
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:26,305
- By anybody? Or just me?
- You. Men.

837
01:10:29,643 --> 01:10:31,310
Really?

838
01:10:31,395 --> 01:10:35,398
You didn't seem to mind at my
office that day, or at the stables.

839
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:39,610
And all this last week I've handled
you, kissed you many times.

840
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:44,323
Why didn't you break out in a cold
sweat and back into a corner then?

841
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:47,243
I thought I could
stand it if I had to.

842
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,662
I see.

843
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:53,416
- Well, have you always felt like this?
- Always, yes.

844
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,000
Why? What happened to you?

845
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:58,087
Happened? Nothing.
Nothing happened to me.

846
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:01,090
I just never wanted
anybody to touch me.

847
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,426
You ever tried
to talk about it,

848
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:05,678
to a doctor or somebody
who could help you?

849
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,681
No, why should I?
I didn't want to get married.

850
01:11:08,807 --> 01:11:13,102
It's degrading. It's animal. Anyway,
I was doing all right the way I was.

851
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:14,854
I wouldn't say that, Marnie.

852
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,939
If I hadn't caught you,
you'd have gone on stealing.

853
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:21,610
- No. No I wouldn't.
- Yes, you would, again and again.

854
01:11:21,695 --> 01:11:24,697
Eventually, you would've
got caught by somebody.

855
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:27,116
Since you're such
a tempting little thing.

856
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,953
Some other sexual blackmailer
would've got his hands on you.

857
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:35,791
The chances of it being someone as
permissive as me are pretty remote.

858
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:37,793
Sooner or later
you'd have gone to jail.

859
01:11:37,878 --> 01:11:42,047
Or been cornered in an office by
some angry old bull of a businessman

860
01:11:42,174 --> 01:11:44,633
who was out to take what he
figured was coming to him.

861
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:47,303
You'd probably
have got him and jail.

862
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:50,222
So I wouldn't say you were
doing all right, Marnie.

863
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:52,475
I'd say you needed
all the help you could get.

864
01:11:52,559 --> 01:11:54,894
Well, I don't need your help.

865
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:59,899
I don't think you're capable of judging
what you need or from whom you need it.

866
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:03,861
What you do need, I expect,
is a psychiatrist.

867
01:12:04,196 --> 01:12:07,740
Oh, men! You say "no thanks"
to one of them,

868
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:10,576
and bingo, you're a candidate
for the funny farm.

869
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,746
It would be hilarious
if it weren't pathetic.

870
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:17,917
Let's try to get some rest, hmm?
We'll talk this out tomorrow.

871
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:21,504
There's nothing to talk out.
I've told you how I feel.

872
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:26,258
I'll feel the same way tomorrow, and
the day after, and the day after that.

873
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:30,262
All right, Marnie. We won't talk
about it until you want to.

874
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:34,433
But we're gonna be on this damn
boat for many days and nights.

875
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:36,185
So, let's just drop the
whole thing for the present

876
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,354
and try to get through
this bloody honeymoon cruise

877
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:40,940
with as much grace
as possible.

878
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:44,777
Let's try at least to
be kind to each other.

879
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,237
Oh. Kind!

880
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,948
All right, if that's
too much,

881
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:52,409
I'll be kind to you,
and you'll be polite to me.

882
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:54,119
You won't...

883
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:57,790
I won't.

884
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,961
I give you my word.

885
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:08,050
Now, let's try to get
some rest. How about it?

886
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:12,638
You in your little bed over there, and
me light years away in mine here.

887
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:15,808
Thank you.

888
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:20,813
I think I'd like to stay out
here for a while, but thank you.

889
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:37,997
You're gonna bring a little pizzazz
down to the old farm, my dear.

890
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:40,791
I noticed before we left, Dad was
pulling out his silk shirts.

891
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:43,419
What do you mean,
what will I do with myself?

892
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:45,921
I had of course assumed I would
become a society hostess.

893
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:50,050
In Africa, in Kenya, there's
quite a beautiful flower.

894
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:53,596
It's coral colored with
little green-tipped blossoms,

895
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,015
rather like a hyacinth.

896
01:13:56,725 --> 01:13:58,934
If you reach out to touch it,

897
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:02,521
you'd discover that the flower
was not a flower at all,

898
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:07,776
but a design made up of hundreds of
tiny insects called fattid bugs.

899
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:12,531
They escape the eyes of hungry birds by
living and dying in the shape of a flower.

901
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:32,176
I'll close the door, if you don't mind.
The light bothers me.

902
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,807
Hmm, what's that, dear?
The light? Oh, yes, of course.

903
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:42,811
You've been an absolute darling about my
sitting up reading so late these nights.

904
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:45,397
I'm boning up on marine life

905
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,192
since entomology doesn't
seem to be your subject,

906
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:51,445
and I'm eager to find a
subject, Marnie, any subject.

907
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:56,700
All right.
Here's a subject. How long?

908
01:14:56,785 --> 01:15:00,537
How long do we have to stay
on this boat, this trip?

909
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:02,956
How long before
we can go back?

910
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,625
Why, Mrs. Rutland.

911
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:08,754
Can you be suggesting that these
halcyon honeymoon days and nights,

912
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,424
just the two of us alone
together, should ever end?

913
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,768
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go to bed.

914
01:15:22,894 --> 01:15:25,437
I've told you the light from
the sitting room bothers me.

915
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:29,983
Well, we certainly can't have
anything bothering you, can we?

916
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:33,278
If you don't want to go
to bed, please get out.

917
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:38,951
But I do want to go to bed, Marnie.
I very much want to go to bed.

Why the hell didn't
you jump over the side?

924
01:19:24,552 --> 01:19:28,305
The idea was to kill myself,
not feed the damn fish.

Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Was Fiji grisly?

927
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:45,906
Well, we didn't get to Fiji. We jumped
ship in Honolulu and flew back.

928
01:19:46,032 --> 01:19:49,910
And we had to take a cab from the airport.
We're both a bit tired and grimy.

929
01:19:50,036 --> 01:19:52,245
Remember when you were six,
you wanted to go to New York?

930
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:54,790
I warned you then that traveling
was a nasty business.

931
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:56,583
You poor things.
You must be exhausted.

932
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,961
Yeah, I think what we'll do is go
straight up, have a fast drink,

933
01:19:59,045 --> 01:20:00,420
and pop up to bed.

to wait for morning, okay?

- Where's the rest of your luggage?
- At the airport.

936
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:07,260
Goodnight, Dad. I'll have breakfast
with you in the morning.

- We'll see you then, Lil.
- Goodnight, Mark.

It's not exactly a house
of correction, you know.

940
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:14,161
Look, Marnie, for the present,
all we've got is the facade,

941
01:21:14,287 --> 01:21:16,246
and we've got to live it.

942
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:18,582
Dad has breakfast downstairs
at 8:30 every morning

to the office?

On the first day back after our honeymoon?
How indelicate.

No, I'm going down the road on
a little errand. I'll see you later.

She said she hadn't been able to
write because she'd had the flu.

1005
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,400
She didn't know when she'd
be able to get to Baltimore

but that she'd send

It's some sort of gag.

you fancy? We could run an ad.

Yeah, I got that. Go on.

1039
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:51,052
Wait a minute.
You say she killed him?

1040
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:54,013
Well, when was that?

1041
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,434
That means the little girl must have
been about five, is that right?

1042
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:01,354
Well, what happened to her?
No, not the woman. The child.

1043
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,483
I want to know what happened to
the little girl, the daughter.

1044
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:10,655
No, no. Stay on there.
Get me anything else you can.

1045
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,241
Look, have photostats made
of all the court records.

1046
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:16,953
Send them to me immediately.
Yes, to my office. Registered.

01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:25,461
Yeah. Mr. Boyle,
get the photostats to me. Yes.

1050
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:29,549
And call me the minute you get
anything further on the child.

1051

Thank you. I'll expect
to hear from you. Goodbye.

Oh, Mama, don't cry.
Please don't cry, Mama.

Mama?
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

- Wake up, Marnie.

1063
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:24,395
- Mama?
- Marnie?

1064
01:31:26,315 --> 01:31:27,815
Mama?

1065
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:31,027
Oh, don't hurt my mama.

1066
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,738
- Marnie.
- Please don't hurt my mama!

1067
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:42,872
Marnie.

1068
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,457
No, don't, don't!

1069
01:31:46,794 --> 01:31:48,378
What's going on?

1070
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:50,088
- She's having a nightmare.
- No.

1071
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:51,923
- No, Mama.
- Come on, Marnie.

1072
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:53,216
- Mama?
- Wake up. Wake up.

1073
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,677
It's just a nightmare.
Come on.

1074
01:32:00,099 --> 01:32:02,934
- She's all right.
- I'm cold.

1075
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:09,190
That's supposed to be your
department, isn't it, old boy?

1076
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:11,150
Good night, all.

1077
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:29,836
- Let me get you a brandy.
- Uh-uh.

1078
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:34,298
Where did you
get these things?

1079
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:38,636
I can get more any
time I want them.

1080
01:32:38,846 --> 01:32:40,388
Yeah, of course you can.

1081
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:45,518
You can also find, at your convenience,
heights, ropes, ovens, even plastic bags.

1082
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:48,146
The world's full
of alternatives.

1083
01:32:48,731 --> 01:32:51,149
I'd like to go
back to sleep now.

1084
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:55,403
Why? Your sleep seems even less
agreeable than your waking hours.

1085
01:32:56,739 --> 01:33:01,576
That, uh, dream. You know,
you've had it before.

1086
01:33:02,995 --> 01:33:05,413
Is it about something
that really happened to you?

1087
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:09,250
No, I don't know
what it means. Nothing.

1088
01:33:10,252 --> 01:33:13,838
Well, it's about your mother.
She wants you to get up.

1089
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:17,717
Yes, but first there
are the three taps.

1090
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:24,015
And then she says, "Get up, Marnie.
You have to get up now!"

1091
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:26,726
But I don't want to. If I...

1092
01:33:27,603 --> 01:33:30,855
If I get up, I'll be
cold and they'll hurt her.

1093
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:33,524
Who? Who'll hurt her?

1094
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:39,489
The... The... Them!
I don't know. I don't know.

1095
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:43,409
But I hear the noises. I'm
cold and I hear the noises!

1096
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:45,953
What noises?
What are they like?

1097
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:53,753
Who makes them?

1098
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:03,387
You Freud, me Jane?

1099
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:12,355
If you won't see an analyst, why
don't you try to help yourself?

1100
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:16,567
But that's why I'm in this trap,
is from trying to help myself.

1101
01:34:16,902 --> 01:34:18,986
Just leave me alone,
Mark, please.

1102
01:34:19,071 --> 01:34:22,156
If I give you some books,
will you read them?

1103
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:25,117
Your new homework?
<i>Frigidity In Women?</i>

1104
01:34:25,202 --> 01:34:27,912
<i>The Psychopathic
Delinquent and Criminal?</i>

1105
01:34:28,247 --> 01:34:31,624
- Have you read them?
- I don't need to read that muck

1106
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:36,254
to know that women are stupid and
feeble and that men are filthy pigs.

1107
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:42,635
In case you didn't recognize
it, that was a rejection.

1108
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:47,765
I want you to read them. Start with
<i>The Undiscovered Self.</i>

1109
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:51,435
Oh, for God's sake, Mark,
leave me alone! I'm tired!

1110
01:34:53,939 --> 01:34:57,567
Why can't you just
leave me alone?

1111
01:34:57,651 --> 01:35:00,486
Because I think
you're sick, old dear.

1112
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:02,947
I'm sick?

1113
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:07,368
Well, take a look
at yourself, old dear.

1114
01:35:07,786 --> 01:35:11,622
You're so hot to play mental
health week, what about you?

1115
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:16,294
Talk about dream worlds. You've
got a pathological fix on a woman

1116
01:35:16,378 --> 01:35:21,007
who's not only an admitted criminal
but who screams if you come near her!

1117
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:27,221
So, what about your dreams,
Daddy dear?

1118
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:30,558
Well, I never said
I was perfect.

1119
01:35:31,143 --> 01:35:33,936
That was quite a speech.
It encourages me to believe

1120
01:35:34,021 --> 01:35:36,689
that you have leafed through
one or two books.

1121
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:39,817
Which one did you find
the most interesting?

1122
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:44,655
You're really dying
to play doctor, aren't you?

1123
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:49,660
Okay, I'm a big movie fan.
I know the games.

1124
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,496
Come on. Let's play.

1125
01:35:52,748 --> 01:35:56,334
Shall I start with dreams
or should we free-associate?

1126
01:35:57,502 --> 01:36:01,339
Oh, Doctor, I'll bet you're
just dying to free-associate.

1127
01:36:02,674 --> 01:36:05,843
All right now, you give me a word
and I'll give you an association.

1128
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:10,222
You know, like, needles, pins, when
a man marries, trouble begins.

01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,141
You ready?

1130
01:36:14,186 --> 01:36:18,689
Well, come on. I thought you wanted
to play doctor, so let's play.

1131
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:20,691
Water.

1132
01:36:21,485 --> 01:36:25,696
Bath. Soap. Cleanse. Pure.
Made pure for me.

sins and make thee over again."

me to church twice on Sundays.

1135
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,836
There. I'm not
holding back at all, am I?

1136
01:36:40,921 --> 01:36:43,339
You're bringing me
out marvelously, Doctor.

1137
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:45,883
You'll have me up on my poor
paralyzed little legs

1138
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:48,094
by the very next scene. Go on.

1140
01:36:50,555 --> 01:36:53,391
Stare. And that's what you do.

1141
01:36:56,061 --> 01:37:00,356
You stare and blare and say you care,
but you're unfair, you want a pair.

1185
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:52,987
How do you do?

1186
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:56,490
Well, this is a surprise. I
hadn't heard about your marriage.

1187
01:39:56,575 --> 01:40:00,077
You know, we all think
a great deal of your husband.

1188
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:04,665
We've been doing business
with the Rutlands

1189
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,417
for a long time.

1190
01:40:11,423 --> 01:40:13,591
I believe we've met before.

1191
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:16,218
I don't think so.

1192
01:40:18,263 --> 01:40:21,682
Think again, Mrs. Rutland.

1193
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,351
Are you just recently married?

1194
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:27,354
Oh, Marnie and I have been
married for two months.

1195
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:29,273
But we've known each other quite
well for about four years.

1196
01:40:29,357 --> 01:40:32,443
Four years? Before Estelle...

1197
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:34,737
Yes, didn't you know?

1198
01:40:38,116 --> 01:40:40,367
Darling, Betty seems rather
stranded over there.

1199
01:40:40,452 --> 01:40:43,454
You'll have to excuse us
for a few moments, Mrs. Strutt.

1200
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:46,457
Oh, and Lil, would you see that
Mr. and Mrs. Strutt's glasses

1201
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:49,376
are kept brimming?
That's a good girl.

1202
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:52,463
- I'm going to be sick.
- You're not going to be sick.

1203
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:54,882
You said we'd known each other four years.
Lil thought...

1204
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:58,052
I don't give one infinitesimal
damn what Lil thought or thinks.

1205
01:40:58,136 --> 01:41:01,138
- Dinner is ready, sir.
- Good. Announce it.

1206
01:41:02,307 --> 01:41:04,058
Dinner is served.

1207
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:11,732
Mr. Strutt, my wife's taken a fancy to you.
Will you see her into dinner?

1208
01:41:22,744 --> 01:41:24,912
Five minutes.
I'm five minutes behind you,

1209
01:41:24,996 --> 01:41:27,331
and in those five minutes you've
got yourself up like a cat burglar

1210
01:41:27,415 --> 01:41:28,999
and packed for a world cruise.

1211
01:41:29,084 --> 01:41:31,168
I've got to get out of here,
and you've got to let me go.

1212
01:41:31,253 --> 01:41:33,337
That man is going to send me to jail.
You know he is!

1213
01:41:33,463 --> 01:41:35,589
Oh, what are you using
for guts this season, Marnie?

1214
01:41:35,674 --> 01:41:36,840
Don't you understand?

1215
01:41:36,925 --> 01:41:39,426
He's coming back here tomorrow
and he's coming for my head!

1216
01:41:39,511 --> 01:41:41,428
Well, darling,
we just won't give it to him.

1217
01:41:41,513 --> 01:41:44,515
Strutt may be throbbing away out there
in the night with vengeful fantasies,

1218
01:41:44,641 --> 01:41:46,016
but the fact is
he's a businessman.

1219
01:41:46,101 --> 01:41:47,851
That means he's in the
business of doing business.

1220
01:41:47,936 --> 01:41:50,354
- So?
- So we try to do business.

1221
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,273
The Rutland account is one
of the biggest he's got.

1222
01:41:52,357 --> 01:41:55,192
And if he insists on acting like
the little swine he is, then...

1223
01:41:55,318 --> 01:41:57,111
And he'll lose others,
too, I'll see to it.

1224
01:41:57,195 --> 01:41:59,697
But first I'll see to it that he
understands that I'll see to it.

1225
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:01,365
Suppose you can keep him
from prosecuting,

1226
01:42:01,491 --> 01:42:02,866
you can't keep
him from talking.

1227
01:42:02,993 --> 01:42:05,619
I don't care if he outtalks every
Southern senator on Capitol Hill.

1228
01:42:05,704 --> 01:42:07,288
Well, I do. I care.

1229
01:42:07,372 --> 01:42:10,958
Darling, didn't your mother ever
tell you about sticks and stones?

1230
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:14,295
Can't you understand, there
may be other things involved,

1231
01:42:14,379 --> 01:42:17,047
other people that I don't
want to hear about me?

1232
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:18,424
Yes, I can understand,

1233
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:22,720
but since you're the well-known,
friendless orphan child, who's to care?

1234
01:42:22,804 --> 01:42:24,054
The police, damn you.

1235
01:42:24,139 --> 01:42:26,890
Now what can the police do if we
can stop Strutt from prosecuting?

1236
01:42:26,975 --> 01:42:30,894
They can start investigating other jobs.
Other similar jobs.

1237
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:39,403
- Well, that's something else again.
- Yes, it is.

1238
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:41,864
How many? How many other jobs?

1239
01:42:44,409 --> 01:42:47,244
Well, tell me the truth, damn it. You've
nothing to gain by lying to me now.

1240
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:50,164
- How many jobs have you pulled?
- Three.

1241
01:42:51,374 --> 01:42:53,250
Try again.

1242
01:42:53,335 --> 01:42:56,003
Four. Five counting Strutt.

1243
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:58,255
Over how long a period?

1244
01:42:58,381 --> 01:43:01,091
Five years, and that's
the truth, I swear it!

1245
01:43:01,426 --> 01:43:02,926
All right. How much?

1246
01:43:03,053 --> 01:43:06,597
- How much all together?
- Under $50,000.

1247
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:08,182
In what towns?

1248
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:11,852
Buffalo, Detroit, Elizabeth,
New Jersey and New York.

1249
01:43:12,354 --> 01:43:14,271
Well, in New York
and Philadelphia,

1250
01:43:14,356 --> 01:43:17,441
I'll be poor old Mark Rutland who
lost his head over a pretty girl.

1251
01:43:17,567 --> 01:43:19,610
And in the others, I'm just
an accessory after the fact

1252
01:43:19,694 --> 01:43:22,446
- and equally liable under the law.
- Well, then let me go.

1253
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:24,615
They can't blame you
because you didn't know.

1254
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:27,534
After you found out,
I ran away. Just let me go!

1255
01:43:27,619 --> 01:43:29,620
If I let you run out now, nothing
could keep the lid on it.

1256
01:43:29,746 --> 01:43:33,374
They've got your real name. They'll
work up a complete dossier on you.

1257
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:35,376
When they finally catch you, and
they will catch you, Marnie,

1258
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,128
they'll throw the New York
City Library at you.

1259
01:43:38,213 --> 01:43:41,090
But suppose we
don't lose our heads?

1260
01:43:41,174 --> 01:43:45,344
All we've got to fight is Strutt's big
mouth. At least that gives us time.

1261
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:47,596
Sit down. Listen.

1262
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,598
Now, we can do one
of two things.

1263
01:43:49,682 --> 01:43:52,184
We can hire a lawyer
and a psychiatrist,

1264
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:54,436
and make an immediate
voluntary confession

1265
01:43:54,521 --> 01:43:57,398
and an offer of restitution. That'll
make the whole thing public.

1266
01:43:57,482 --> 01:44:02,319
But the chances are very good that
you'll get a suspended sentence.

1267
01:44:02,404 --> 01:44:03,862
Now the alternative.

1268
01:44:03,947 --> 01:44:07,950
We can go together and make private
calls on all the places you've robbed.

1269
01:44:08,034 --> 01:44:13,539
You'll express deep sorrow and repentance,
sincere and vocal contrition.

1270
01:44:13,623 --> 01:44:16,291
And while you sob, I show a
check for the amount stolen

1271
01:44:16,376 --> 01:44:19,086
and press it into
their hot little hands

1272
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:22,131
and ask as a special favor
to a distraught husband,

1273
01:44:22,215 --> 01:44:24,049
to withdraw the charge.

1274
01:44:24,134 --> 01:44:26,009
But if one of them says, "Thanks,
I'll take the money back

1275
01:44:26,094 --> 01:44:28,262
"but I won't drop the charge."
Then we've had it.

1276
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:32,474
After that it's an open court case,
and a very probable sentence.

1277
01:44:34,686 --> 01:44:38,480
On the other hand, with a bit
of luck, we might pull it off.

1278
01:44:38,565 --> 01:44:40,149
Think it over.

1279
01:44:41,151 --> 01:44:43,735
It's late. You better get some sleep now.
You got to be up for the hunt.

1280
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:46,071
You don't expect me
to ride in the hunt.

1281
01:44:46,156 --> 01:44:48,282
Certainly I expect
you to ride.

1282
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:50,868
For one thing, I want you out of
the house when Strutt comes here.

1283
01:44:50,952 --> 01:44:52,786
And for another, I don't want
to give Lil the satisfaction

1284
01:44:52,871 --> 01:44:54,913
of seeing you chicken.

1285
01:44:54,998 --> 01:44:57,916
And, Marnie,
tonight the door stays open.

01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:10,473
I'll talk to you again, possibly tomorrow.
I'm sorry to have to run out like this.

1333
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,650
MARK: I'll take
you home, Marnie.

1334
01:53:49,949 --> 01:53:51,700
It's all right, darling.

1335
01:53:57,665 --> 01:54:00,583
You're just exhausted.
Now, don't panic.

1336
01:54:04,005 --> 01:54:07,132
I've spoken to Strutt. I think
I'll be able to talk him around.

1337
01:54:16,934 --> 01:54:19,019
I'll just put this away.

1338
01:54:46,172 --> 01:54:48,214
Go on. You want the money.

1339
01:54:48,299 --> 01:54:51,009
You wanted the money, or you wouldn't
have taken my keys, would you?

1340
01:54:51,093 --> 01:54:53,219
You took the keys,
now take the money!

1341
01:54:53,304 --> 01:54:54,929
I said take it!

1342
01:55:00,144 --> 01:55:05,398
What's mine belongs to you. It's yours.
You're not stealing.

1343
01:55:05,483 --> 01:55:08,610
You want the money,
take it. I said take it!

1344
01:55:27,546 --> 01:55:32,467
Marnie, now we're going to
Baltimore to see your mother.

1345
01:55:32,551 --> 01:55:33,927
- No!
- Yes.

1346
01:55:49,276 --> 01:55:50,610
Come on.

1347
01:55:56,909 --> 01:56:00,578
So, I knew you'd run away
and you'd want money.

1348
01:56:00,663 --> 01:56:05,166
It didn't take me a minute to find
out the office drawer key was gone.

1349
01:56:05,626 --> 01:56:09,337
If you tell my mother
about me, I'll kill you.

1350
01:56:11,173 --> 01:56:15,969
If you mean about the robberies, I've
no intention of telling her anything.

1351
01:56:16,637 --> 01:56:19,848
It's your mother who's going
to do the talking.

1352
01:56:21,934 --> 01:56:23,726
(THUNDER CRACKING)

1353
01:56:29,066 --> 01:56:30,733
Marnie, come on.

1354
01:56:32,069 --> 01:56:33,611
- No!
- Come on.

1355
01:56:44,039 --> 01:56:45,582
(THUNDER CRACKING)

1356
01:56:52,423 --> 01:56:55,133
- It's all right, Marnie. You're inside.
- MAMA: What in the wide world?

1357
01:56:55,217 --> 01:56:57,552
I'm sorry to crash in
on you like this, Mrs. Edgar.

1358
01:56:57,636 --> 01:57:01,181
I guess you know how
Marnie feels about storms.

1359
01:57:01,307 --> 01:57:04,350
- Marnie, stop acting like such a ninny.
- Pardon me.

1360
01:57:04,435 --> 01:57:07,812
Who are you, mister?
You're not Mr. Pendleton.

1361
01:57:07,897 --> 01:57:10,106
No, I'm not.
Who's Mr. Pendleton?

1362
01:57:10,191 --> 01:57:12,734
Then what have you got to do
with my Marnie?

1363
01:57:12,818 --> 01:57:15,862
Well, I'm Mark Rutland,
Marnie's husband, Mrs. Edgar.

1364
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:17,447
Marnie hasn't been very well.

1365
01:57:17,531 --> 01:57:20,408
I don't believe she's been very
well since you had your accident.

1366
01:57:20,492 --> 01:57:21,534
My what?

1367
01:57:21,619 --> 01:57:24,037
I think you've always
called it "your accident."

1368
01:57:24,121 --> 01:57:26,748
What do you think
you're talking about?

1369
01:57:26,832 --> 01:57:30,627
Coming into my house like this,
talking about my accident!

1370
01:57:31,795 --> 01:57:34,589
You're not married to Marnie.
I don't believe you.

1371
01:57:34,673 --> 01:57:37,884
- MAMA: Marnie?
- Your daughter needs help, Mrs. Edgar.

1372
01:57:37,968 --> 01:57:39,677
You've got to
tell her the truth.

1373
01:57:39,762 --> 01:57:42,347
She has no memory of
what happened that night.

1374
01:57:42,431 --> 01:57:46,809
And she needs to remember everything.
You must help her.

1375
01:57:46,894 --> 01:57:49,729
Mister, you must be
plumb crazy.

1376
01:57:50,314 --> 01:57:51,731
If you won't tell her, I will.

1377
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:54,359
I know everything that happened,
and I'll tell her the whole story.

1378
01:57:54,443 --> 01:57:55,652
Oh, no you won't, mister,

1379
01:57:55,736 --> 01:58:00,031
because you don't know the whole
story, and nobody does but me!

1380
01:58:00,658 --> 01:58:04,410
Oh. Well, since you're so very
knowledgeable, Mrs. Edgar,

1381
01:58:04,495 --> 01:58:07,538
do you also know that your daughter,
your beautiful, young daughter,

1382
01:58:07,623 --> 01:58:11,251
cannot stand to have a man
touch her? Any man?

1383
01:58:11,335 --> 01:58:13,544
She doesn't know why,
but you do.

1384
01:58:13,629 --> 01:58:16,130
Don't you think you owe it to
her to help her to understand

1385
01:58:16,215 --> 01:58:17,674
what happened to
make her like this?

1386
01:58:17,758 --> 01:58:19,008
What matters what made her?

1387
01:58:19,093 --> 01:58:22,845
She's lucky. She's lucky to feel like that.
Just plain lucky!

1388
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:28,851
That's very interesting, Mrs. Edgar. But
I've had an investigator working here.

1389
01:58:28,936 --> 01:58:31,354
I've read the transcript. Hmm?

1390
01:58:31,730 --> 01:58:34,107
The records of
your trial for murder.

1391
01:58:34,191 --> 01:58:36,109
In the records it
states quite plainly

1392
01:58:36,193 --> 01:58:39,112
that you made your living
from the touch of men.

1393
01:58:39,238 --> 01:58:43,533
And it was one of your clients that you
killed that night. (THUNDER CRACKING)

1394
01:58:44,034 --> 01:58:45,535
Oh, God!

1395
01:58:46,620 --> 01:58:48,830
Was there also a storm
that night, Mrs. Edgar?

1396
01:58:48,914 --> 01:58:51,207
Is that why Marnie's
terrified of storms?

1397
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:53,584
Was there thunder and
lightning that night?

1398
01:58:53,669 --> 01:58:56,004
Did the storms terrify
your little girl, hmm?

1399
01:58:56,088 --> 01:58:58,131
In addition to everything else
that happened?

1400
01:58:58,215 --> 01:59:02,510
Get out of my house.
You get out!

1401
01:59:03,429 --> 01:59:07,724
I don't need any filthy man
coming in my house no more!

1402
01:59:07,808 --> 01:59:10,768
Do you hear me? You get out!

1403
01:59:10,853 --> 01:59:15,523
(SCREAMING) You get out
of my house! You get out!

You let my mama go!

1405
01:59:18,902 --> 01:59:22,947
You hear? You let my mama go!

1406
01:59:23,032 --> 01:59:25,450
You're hurting my mama!

1407
01:59:25,534 --> 01:59:27,285
Who am I, Marnie?

1408
01:59:27,369 --> 01:59:31,664
- Why should I want to hurt your mama?
- You're one of them.

1409
01:59:34,126 --> 01:59:35,918
One of them in
the white suits.

1410
01:59:36,003 --> 01:59:37,879
- Shut up, Marnie!
- No!

1411
01:59:37,963 --> 01:59:42,675
Remember, Marnie.
Tell us how it all was.

1412
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:44,927
The white suits, remember?

1413
01:59:52,519 --> 01:59:56,105
What does the tapping mean, Marnie?
Why does it make you cry?

1414
01:59:56,190 --> 01:59:59,734
It means they want in.

1415
02:00:01,195 --> 02:00:03,446
Them in their white suits.

1416
02:00:04,740 --> 02:00:07,492
Mama comes and
gets me out of bed.

1417

I don't like to
get out of bed.

You're the only thing in
this world I ever did love.

1484
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:18,260
It was just that I
was so young, Marnie.

1485
02:05:19,930 --> 02:05:22,306
I never had
anything of my own.

1486
02:05:28,689 --> 02:05:31,107
You know how I
got you, Marnie?

1487
02:05:36,279 --> 02:05:39,532
There was this boy, Billy.

1488
02:05:41,535 --> 02:05:44,620
And I wanted Billy's
basketball sweater.

1489
02:05:46,998 --> 02:05:48,374
I was 15.

1490
02:05:51,294 --> 02:05:55,631
And Billy said if I let him,
I could have the sweater.

1491
02:05:58,385 --> 02:05:59,969
So I let him.

1492
02:06:04,307 --> 02:06:08,227
And then later on when you
got started, he run away.

1493
02:06:11,815 --> 02:06:14,150
I still got that old sweater.

1494
02:06:17,028 --> 02:06:18,988
And I got you, Marnie.

1495
02:06:21,992 --> 02:06:26,787
And after the accident,
when I was in the hospital,

1496
02:06:26,872 --> 02:06:30,249
they tried to make
me let you be adopted.

1497
02:06:30,375 --> 02:06:33,377
But I wouldn't. I wanted you.

1498
02:06:34,588 --> 02:06:36,964
And I promised God right then,

1499
02:06:37,048 --> 02:06:41,510
if he'd let me keep you,
and you not remember,

1500
02:06:41,845 --> 02:06:44,680
I'd bring you up
different from me.

1501
02:06:45,515 --> 02:06:48,726
- Decent.
- Decent?

1502
02:06:50,896 --> 02:06:52,271
Oh, Mama!

1503
02:06:55,442 --> 02:06:58,277
Well, you surely
realized your ambition.

1504
02:06:58,695 --> 02:07:01,113
I certainly am decent.

1505
02:07:02,866 --> 02:07:06,869
Of course, I'm a cheat
and a liar and a thief,

1506
02:07:09,956 --> 02:07:11,707
but I am decent.

1507
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:18,380
Marnie, it's time to have a
little compassion for yourself.

1508
02:07:19,758 --> 02:07:25,221
When a child, a child of any
age, Marnie, can't get love,

1509
02:07:25,722 --> 02:07:29,266
it takes what it can get,
any way it can get it.

1510
02:07:29,726 --> 02:07:32,144
It's not so
hard to understand.

1511
02:07:46,117 --> 02:07:48,911
Get up, Marnie,
you're aching my leg.

1512
02:08:06,763 --> 02:08:09,598
There. That's better.

1513
02:08:12,143 --> 02:08:13,352
Mark?

1514
02:08:16,481 --> 02:08:18,524
What am I going to do?

1515
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:21,610
What's going to happen?

1516
02:08:21,987 --> 02:08:24,196
What do you want to happen?

1517
02:08:26,199 --> 02:08:27,616
I guess I...

1518
02:08:28,952 --> 02:08:31,287
I want it all cleared up.

1519
02:08:31,371 --> 02:08:35,541
Will I... Will I go to jail?

1520
02:08:37,127 --> 02:08:39,962
No. Not after what
I have to tell them.

1521
02:08:47,470 --> 02:08:49,013
We'll go now.

1522
02:08:56,813 --> 02:09:01,400
Mrs. Edgar, I'll bring Marnie back.
She's very tired now.

1523
02:09:04,154 --> 02:09:05,738
Goodbye, Mama.

1524
02:09:08,158 --> 02:09:09,491
Goodbye.

1525
02:09:16,333 --> 02:09:18,083
Goodbye, sugarpop.

1526
02:09:32,265 --> 02:09:36,435
Oh, Mark, I don't want
to go to jail.

1527
02:09:37,354 --> 02:09:40,439
- I'd rather stay with you.
- Had you, love?

1528
02:09:42,067 --> 02:09:44,902
GIRLS: (SINGING) Send for
the doctor over the hill.

1529
02:09:45,028 --> 02:09:48,030
Call for the doctor.
Call for the nurse.

1530
02:09:48,114 --> 02:09:51,116
Call for the lady
with the alligator purse.
