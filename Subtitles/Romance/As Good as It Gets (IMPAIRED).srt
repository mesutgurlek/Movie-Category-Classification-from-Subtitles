- It's your home...

771
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:02,765
Ha.

772
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:05,309
Uh, can we get you anything else?

773
00:55:05,394 --> 00:55:09,397
- Do you want some water or some coffee?
- No, thank you.

774
00:55:09,523 --> 00:55:12,608
A couple of female slaves?
[Laughs]

775
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:16,529
Mrs. Connelly, there's still
a lot of tests I need to do,

776
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,531
a lot of things I have to find out here.

777
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,783
But look, whatever I find out,

778
00:55:20,867 --> 00:55:22,994
I promise you at the very least
from now on...

779
00:55:23,078 --> 00:55:26,706
your son is gonna feel
a great deal better, okay?

780
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:37,216

No... Um, fine.
Okay. Okay, that's good.

783
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,895
That's good.
[Mumbling]

784
00:55:51,732 --> 00:55:54,483
So, listen, you gotta let me
know about the additional costs.

785
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:56,131
One way or another we'll...

786
00:55:56,156 --> 00:55:58,556
Well, the costs are gonna be
considerable, I'm afraid.

00:56:00,115 --> 00:56:04,618
But don't worry.
Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:10,249
That's wonderful.

you for everything, Nora.

No.

00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:01,801
Uh, would there be any way...

802
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:06,097
that you would be willing
to walk his dog for him?

803
00:57:06,181 --> 00:57:08,224
Absolutely.

804
00:57:08,308 --> 00:57:10,810
You're a wonderful man.

805
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:18,275
2:00 would be a good time,

in case he is asleep.

Open his curtains for him...

808
00:57:23,698 --> 00:57:26,492
so he can see God's beautiful work.

809
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:28,702
And he'll know that...

even things like this
happen for the best.

Where did they teach you

Or is this getaway day and
your last shot at his whiskey?

Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

No, no! There is a seriously
goofy man behind this!

That's not why I'm here.

Though you have no idea what it's
like to have a real conversation...

I have a hair dryer, uh...

01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,378
Why did you do this for me?

908
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,717
So you'd come back to work
and wait on me.

909
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:26,388
Do have some idea
how strange that sounds?

Well, I mean...
I'm worried you did this be...

So, you'll be at work tomorrow?

927
01:06:59,357 --> 01:07:01,566
Yes.

928

01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:19,793
"Never," she said.
"Never," she says.

[Chains Clanking]

934
01:07:37,895 --> 01:07:41,690
I took a chan...
took a chance you were up.

935
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:45,527
Uh, I brought you some Chinese soup.

936
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:49,364
Uh, thanks.

[Grunts, Inhales Sharply]

938
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,173
Boy.

939
01:08:06,257 --> 01:08:08,967
I've never been this tired in my life.

940
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:18,810
I haven't been sleepin'.

941
01:08:21,606 --> 01:08:24,232
I haven't been clear in my head...

942
01:08:24,317 --> 01:08:26,777
or felt like myself.

943
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:30,781
I'm in trouble.

944
01:08:32,658 --> 01:08:35,619
It's not just the tiredness.

945
01:08:35,745 --> 01:08:39,456
Boy. It's sick.
Nauseous.

946
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,500
Sleepy.

947
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,752
Where everything looks distorted,

948
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:47,339
and everything inside
just kind of aches...

949
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:50,467
and you can barely find
the will to complain.

950
01:08:50,551 --> 01:08:53,261
Yeah.
Yeah.

951
01:08:53,346 --> 01:08:55,764
Oh.

952
01:08:55,848 --> 01:08:58,850
I'm glad we did this.

953
01:09:00,186 --> 01:09:02,604
Good talking to you.

[Door Closing]

955
01:09:10,696 --> 01:09:13,448
You are not still writing
that thank... you note?

956
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:17,202
I'm on the last page.
How do you spell "conscience"?

957
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:21,164

C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

958
01:09:21,249 --> 01:09:26,461
Look, I got Sean from the bakery
to baby-sit so we could go out.

959
01:09:26,546 --> 01:09:28,880
I still don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

960
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:32,425
- Could you spell it again, please?
- Spencer's okay.

961
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:36,805
You better start finding something
else to do with your free time.

962
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:39,474
- Sean, are you hungry?
- [Sean] Yeah.

963
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:42,144
[Beverly] All right.
We got pizza!

964
01:09:42,228 --> 01:09:44,396
Carol and I are going out.

965
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,607
Sausage, pepperoni. You wanna make
this later for you and Spencer?

966
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:52,404
[Sean] Great.
[Sighs] We are goin' out like people do.

967
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:58,243
If you can't feel good about this break...

968
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:02,205
and step out a little, then I...

969
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:07,586
I think you ought to have Mr. Udall
send you over a psychiatrist.

970
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,589
I don't need one, 'cause I know
what's really going on here!

971
01:10:12,091 --> 01:10:15,010
I gotta finish this letter,
or I'll go nuts.

972
01:10:15,094 --> 01:10:19,347
- Carol...
- This can't be right. "Con-science"?

01:10:19,432 --> 01:10:21,391
Carol?

01:10:25,146 --> 01:10:27,105
What?

[Gasping]

976
01:10:44,081 --> 01:10:47,792
It's very weird now, not feeling that...

977
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,795
stupid panic thing
inside me all the time.

978
01:10:52,965 --> 01:10:56,051
Without that, I just start
thinking about myself, and...

979
01:10:56,135 --> 01:10:59,304
what good does that ever get anybody?

980

[Sniffling]

981
01:11:03,017 --> 01:11:06,603
Today, on the bus, there
was this adorable couple,

982
01:11:06,687 --> 01:11:09,731
and I felt myself...

983
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:12,943
giving 'em a dirty look.

984
01:11:14,987 --> 01:11:20,408

Go ahead.

Moving in the wrong direction...

989
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:39,302
away from a time when I
remembered what it was like...

990
01:11:39,387 --> 01:11:42,389
to have a man to anything.

991
01:11:42,473 --> 01:11:44,891
Hold, fucking...

01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:53,984
And...

995
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:57,612
I felt almost...

996
01:11:57,697 --> 01:12:01,157
r-really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.

[Laughing]

998
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:08,206
Which is probably why I make poor
Spencer hug me more than he wants to.

[Sniffles]

The poor kid doesn't have
enough problems.

1001
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:16,131
He has to make up
for his mom not getting any.

Who needs these thoughts?

1004
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:25,851
So, what are you saying?
That you're frustrated?

[Knocks Table] Why are you doing this?
What is it you want?

1007

I hope getting me thinking
about everything that's wrong,

1008
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:38,370
when all I want to do is
not do that, has some purpose.

Really, Mom, what is it you want?

1010

What?

windows, and there's lots of light.

know where my wife is.

[Chattering Continues, Indistinct]

1019
01:13:17,193 --> 01:13:20,487
Thank you. Now, I gotta
send you a thank-you note.

Oh, look, Evelyn's here,
and her giant Joey.

[Woman]
Beverly!

1023
01:13:29,455 --> 01:13:32,306
That's why you brought me here.
That's really why you brought me here.

1024
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:34,626
Well, you know, it's not even mine.

1025
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:37,837
And this guy Simon seems
to have enough on his mind.

1026
01:13:37,922 --> 01:13:42,050
But the dog did throw up twice
last night and his spark is off.

1027
01:13:42,176 --> 01:13:45,053
Well, take him to the vet.
I did.

1028
01:13:45,137 --> 01:13:49,265
They say his stomach's out of whack and
they need him for a couple of days.

Well, do it.

Okay.
Now, this is for later.

- What's this?
- Um, it's a note.

- A note?
- Yeah, it's a thank-you note.

Thank-you note?
No, no, no.

- You can read it later.
- No. No, thank you.

No. No, thank you.
No, no, no, no.

Yeah.
Real nice, huh?

01:14:29,306 --> 01:14:31,558
Really nice.

1042
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:38,440
Shouldn't that be a good thing, telling
somebody, "No thanks required"?

1043
01:14:38,524 --> 01:14:39,774
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1044
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:44,112
Sure looks like it went over too.
[Laughs]

1045
01:14:44,196 --> 01:14:47,323
I mean... look at you!

1046
01:14:49,201 --> 01:14:53,496
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup last night.

[Continues Laughing]

1048
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:01,921
- What?
- Look at you. You think I'm a mark.

1049
01:15:02,006 --> 01:15:04,382
You helped with the dog.
Now, there's other things.

1050
01:15:04,467 --> 01:15:07,260
Hey, I'm as concerned
about Simon as you are.

1051
01:15:07,386 --> 01:15:10,472
Concerned?
It's not just financial assistance.

1052
01:15:10,556 --> 01:15:13,683
He's gotta get to Baltimore to ask
his parents for money tomorrow.

1053
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:15,977
Yeah, well, yeah.

1054
01:15:16,061 --> 01:15:19,439
I mean, if his parents are alive,
they have to help. It's the rules.

1055
01:15:19,565 --> 01:15:23,818
Good. That's great. Let them help him.
Absolutely.

1056
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:27,238
Only, uh,

1057
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:31,993
I got a high-maintenance selling
painter coming through, so I'm out.

1058
01:15:32,077 --> 01:15:34,162
Can you drive him?

1059
01:15:36,415 --> 01:15:39,876
Think white and get serious.

1060
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,921
Take my car, a convertible?

1061
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,882
[Laughing]
Do you drive?

1062
01:15:45,966 --> 01:15:49,010
Like the wind.
But I'm not doin' it!

1063
01:15:49,094 --> 01:15:51,596
Gettin' loud, gettin' loud.

1064
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:56,059
He wants me to take his car
and his client to Baltimore.

1065
01:15:56,143 --> 01:15:57,555
I want your life for one minute,

1066
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:00,380
where my big problem is somebody
offers me a free convertible...

1067
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:03,608
so I can get out of this city.

1068
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:11,115
[Stomps Foot]
Go ahead, girl.

1069
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,203
[Sighs] Okay, I'll do it.
I'll take him.

1070
01:16:15,287 --> 01:16:16,875
Yeah, get him ready, packed.

1071
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,500
Tomorrow morning, I'll take him.
Okay. I'll take him. Fine.

1072
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:23,670
Okay.
Okay.

1073
01:16:23,754 --> 01:16:27,549
[Exhales] All right, I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

1074
01:16:27,633 --> 01:16:31,219
We don't enjoy one another that much.

1075
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,559
If there is some mental health
foundation that raises money...

1076
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:40,436
for people like you,
please be sure to let me know.

1077
01:16:40,521 --> 01:16:43,273
Last-word freak.

1078
01:16:43,357 --> 01:16:45,233
Bye-bye.
Good luck, lady.

1079
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,736
[Woman] Is he talking to me?
So, anything else?

1080
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:50,488
Yeah.
