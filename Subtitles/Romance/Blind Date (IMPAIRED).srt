* Don't ever let them tell you
That there's no mystery *

1239
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:06,311
* Lo?e can't be explained
It's simply meant to be *

1240
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:16,905
* Well, I never knew so many people *

1241
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:20,867
* Who look and don't find love *

1242
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:22,911
* So they beg
So they beg *

1243
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:28,792
* And they borrow and steal *

1244
01:32:29,377 --> 01:32:33,630
* I'll take half of the joy
Twice the sorrow *

1245
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,258
* If I know love is real *

1246

* Lo?e is real *

1247
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:42,055

You won't be back *

1248
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:47,894

1250
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:54,150

1251
01:32:54,318 --> 01:32:58,446
* But I don't wanna see *

1252
01:32:58,614 --> 01:33:06,246
* If seeing means believing love
Is lost to you and me *

1253

1259
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:36,234
