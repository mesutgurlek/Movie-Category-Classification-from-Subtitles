801
00:47:52,032 --> 00:47:54,175
[Crash]

802
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,566
[Snoring]

803
00:48:02,006 --> 00:48:04,884
[Mikal] What happened? Fuck.

804
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:06,307
Oh, my God.

805
00:48:09,879 --> 00:48:10,888
[Zia] You all right, Eugene?

806
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:11,889
Yeah, I'm fine, man.

807
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:12,890
Yeah?

808
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,348
Oh, my God.

809
00:48:16,317 --> 00:48:17,259
What the...

810
00:48:17,384 --> 00:48:19,884
hey. Hey. Hey.

811
00:48:20,887 --> 00:48:21,919
Maybe he's sleeping.

812
00:48:24,323 --> 00:48:25,199
Be careful.

813
00:48:25,324 --> 00:48:27,768
Hey.

814
00:48:27,893 --> 00:48:29,770
Hey, man.

815
00:48:29,895 --> 00:48:30,771
[Snores]

816
00:48:30,896 --> 00:48:32,439
Ssst.

817
00:48:32,564 --> 00:48:35,031
You on drugs or something?

818
00:48:44,575 --> 00:48:45,874
Jesus.

819
00:48:47,444 --> 00:48:49,821
I must've dozed off.

820
00:48:49,946 --> 00:48:52,757
I think I slept on my ear wrong.

821
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:56,093
Do I look asymmetrical to you at all?

822
00:48:56,218 --> 00:49:01,231
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm raife kneller.

823
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:06,068
Um... Don't call me raife.

824
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,437
My mom used to
call me raife, and I...

825
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:11,072
don't get me started on it.
Just call me kneller.

826
00:49:11,197 --> 00:49:15,910
I lost my dog,
and I'm just sick about it.

827
00:49:16,035 --> 00:49:18,812
You haven't seen a dog.
His name's Freddy.

828
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:22,048
You'd look for him while laying
in the middle of the road.

829
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:24,417
Well, I had to take a break.

830
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:25,985
I mean, it's emotional work.

831
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,987
Emotio... in the middle
of the fucking road?

832
00:49:28,112 --> 00:49:30,856
Don't you think that's
a bit irresponsible?

833
00:49:30,981 --> 00:49:33,792
Hey, look, it's too late, really,

834
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:35,894
to continue looking for Freddy.

835
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:36,895
You know, I, uh...

836
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,221
why don't we go to my place?

837
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:48,138
Nothing really is for rent here.

838
00:49:48,263 --> 00:49:50,874
I mean, it was at one time.

839
00:49:50,999 --> 00:49:55,278
I rented the place
several years ago, and I...

840
00:49:55,403 --> 00:49:59,815
the other thing is
it's not really a camp.

841
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,218
It's just a joke a friend of
mine thought would be funny.

842
00:50:03,343 --> 00:50:05,820
I really don't think it's funny.
Do you think it's funny?

843
00:50:05,945 --> 00:50:08,345
I don't.
Actually...

844
00:50:15,153 --> 00:50:17,096
Guys. Eugene, mik, look at that.

845
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:18,353
What?

846
00:50:22,025 --> 00:50:25,225
That guy was just
floating in the air.

847
00:50:27,662 --> 00:50:28,538
Floating?

848
00:50:28,663 --> 00:50:30,306
He was. He was...

849
00:50:30,431 --> 00:50:32,341
I wouldn't pay any attention to it.

850
00:50:32,466 --> 00:50:34,576
It happens all the time around here.

851
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:36,511
What happens? Miracles?

852
00:50:36,636 --> 00:50:40,181
Yeah, people floating in the air,

853
00:50:40,306 --> 00:50:44,885
like, uh, people turning
stones into plants

854
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:49,923
or changing the color
of different objects.

855
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,357
Fixing the headlights, maybe?

856
00:50:51,482 --> 00:50:53,859
What do you mean,
fixing the headlights?

857
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,929
His headlights have
been broken for ages,

858
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:00,032
and she fixed them not far from
here just by touching a button.

859
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:04,058
Oh. Yeah, something small
and insignificant like that.

860
00:51:05,261 --> 00:51:07,404
Is that another one of your miracles?

861
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:11,608
No, that's nanuk.
She's a mute.

862
00:51:11,733 --> 00:51:14,010
She does this throat singing.

863
00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:17,168
She's hilarious.
I'll be right back.

864
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:22,283
Nanuk, we...
we have new guests.

865
00:51:22,408 --> 00:51:26,053
That guy was 3 feet off the ground.

866
00:51:26,178 --> 00:51:28,845
Fresh sheets, coffee, and all that.

867
00:51:29,848 --> 00:51:31,558
People, nanuk.

868
00:51:31,683 --> 00:51:32,959
Nanuk will look after you.

869
00:51:33,084 --> 00:51:35,394
I got some business.

870
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:39,187
Hey, make sure you
take care of my car, man.

871
00:51:41,124 --> 00:51:42,500
All right, nanuk.

872
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:45,459
I guess you take care of us.

873
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:59,615
Once upon a time,
there was a crooked tree

874
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,416
and a straight tree,

875
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:05,186
and they grew next to each other.

876
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:08,756
And every day the...

877
00:52:08,881 --> 00:52:11,225
Straight tree would look
at the crooked tree.

878
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,427
He would say, "you're crooked.

879
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:15,328
"You've always been crooked,

880
00:52:15,453 --> 00:52:18,264
"and you'll continue to be crooked.

881
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:21,533
But look at me. Look at me,"
said the straight tree.

882
00:52:21,658 --> 00:52:26,070
He said, "I'm tall and I'm straight."

883
00:52:26,195 --> 00:52:30,074
And then one day,
the lumberjacks came into the forest

884
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:31,798
and looked around.

885
00:52:34,502 --> 00:52:36,712
And the manager in charge said,

886
00:52:36,837 --> 00:52:39,114
"cut all the straight trees."

887
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,585
And that crooked tree
is still there to this day,

888
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,444
growing strong and growing strange.

889
00:52:49,414 --> 00:52:50,713
[Applause]

890
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:05,136
Just forget about the miracles, zia.

891
00:53:05,261 --> 00:53:07,304
They don't mean a thing.

892
00:53:07,429 --> 00:53:10,040
Everybody in camp can do that but me.

893
00:53:10,165 --> 00:53:12,398
Hey, give yourself a break, man.

894
00:53:13,601 --> 00:53:15,244
I'm dying to do one.

895
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:19,248
Just a small one,
even if it's stupid.

896
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:20,782
Here's the deal.

897
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:23,184
As long as you want it so bad,

898
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:24,652
it's not gonna happen.

899
00:53:24,777 --> 00:53:29,312
The only way it's gonna work
is if it doesn't matter.

900
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:31,791
Here you go, girl.

901
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:34,160
Drink up, my man.

902
00:53:34,285 --> 00:53:35,628
You know what I'm saying?

903
00:53:35,753 --> 00:53:37,546
I don't know.
I guess.

904
00:53:37,671 --> 00:53:39,465
I don't know.
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

905
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:43,702
It will. It will.

906
00:53:43,827 --> 00:53:45,170
[Car engine, horn]

907
00:53:45,295 --> 00:53:48,540
Hey, kneller, do you mind
if I use your truck?

908
00:53:48,665 --> 00:53:49,741
'Cause we're out of logs.

909
00:53:49,866 --> 00:53:52,343
Sure.
You look great in that.

910
00:53:52,468 --> 00:53:54,267
I know. I like it.

911
00:53:56,204 --> 00:53:59,482
Zia, you wanna go for a ride?

912
00:53:59,607 --> 00:54:01,183
Yeah.

913
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:02,651
Are you gonna be all right, kneller?

914
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:05,243
Go ahead.

915
00:54:22,595 --> 00:54:24,305
It's nice here, right?

916
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,362
Yeah.

917
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:32,399
You ever miss the things
from before you offed?

918
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:38,482
No, I don't really remember much.

919
00:54:38,607 --> 00:54:40,884
I think the only thing
I missed is desiree.

920
00:54:41,009 --> 00:54:45,511
Now that she's here, it's like
the only thing I can think about.

921
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:48,424
I miss everything.

922
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:51,460
I miss my dog, I miss my friends,

923
00:54:51,585 --> 00:54:56,231
I miss my family,
my house, everything.

924
00:54:56,356 --> 00:54:59,590
I even miss the things
I hated at this point.

925
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:01,735
I don't know.

926
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,236
It's weird. I had this dream
the other night

927
00:55:03,361 --> 00:55:04,737
that I woke up in the hospital

928
00:55:04,862 --> 00:55:08,396
'cause my... my suicide didn't work.

929
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,800
And while I was there, I just...

930
00:55:14,702 --> 00:55:16,668
I just kind of missed this.

931
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,191
He's teaching her how to open
a beer with a lighter. Huh?

932
00:55:31,316 --> 00:55:33,526
He's teaching her how to
open a beer with a lighter.

933
00:55:33,651 --> 00:55:35,928
She doesn't even drink.
Let me see.

934
00:55:36,053 --> 00:55:37,729
You see?

935
00:55:37,854 --> 00:55:39,531
Yeah. Yeah.
You should've seen him the other day.

936
00:55:39,656 --> 00:55:41,165
He was trying to teach her

937
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:43,367
the famous basketball players names

938
00:55:43,492 --> 00:55:45,302
and their positions and everything.

939
00:55:45,427 --> 00:55:47,537
She had no clue what he was saying.

940
00:55:47,662 --> 00:55:50,806
The secret is that
she's from way too far away

941
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,674
to pick up on his character.

942
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,176
And half her family offed,
just like his.

943
00:55:55,301 --> 00:55:56,577
I know.

944
00:55:56,702 --> 00:55:59,369
She doesn't live with them, though.

945
00:56:00,905 --> 00:56:04,005
Holy shit.
He caught a fish.

946
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:07,284
Oh, my God, he's doing it.
What?

947
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:09,452
He's changing the color of the fish.

948
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:10,920
With his bare hand,
he's holding the fish,

949
00:56:11,045 --> 00:56:12,588
and he changed the color.

950
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:14,790
Oh, zia,

951
00:56:14,915 --> 00:56:16,391
when are you gonna
stop being obsessed

952
00:56:16,516 --> 00:56:17,982
with those silly little miracles?

953
00:56:21,654 --> 00:56:22,530
I don't know.

954
00:56:22,655 --> 00:56:24,398
When you stop being obsessed

955
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:26,233
with all that people in charge shit.

956
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:29,469
That is not the same.

957
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,770
Yeah, right, you know,

958
00:56:30,895 --> 00:56:32,938
because you're here
by mistake or whatever.

959
00:56:33,063 --> 00:56:34,406
I'm sorry, I guess I just...

960
00:56:34,531 --> 00:56:36,274
I don't see how
you could possibly be...

961
00:56:36,399 --> 00:56:38,576
you know what, listen,

I just cried and cried.

And I had to leave town

reminded me of you.

King. King?

1187
01:09:02,382 --> 01:09:05,159
He was a real friend.

1188
01:09:05,284 --> 01:09:07,928
He got me out of town,
and I started to get

1189
01:09:08,053 --> 01:09:10,697
more and more into his teachings,

1190
01:09:10,822 --> 01:09:12,498
and I just stopped crying.

1191
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:16,602
So then king was supposed to
separate his body from his soul

1192
01:09:16,727 --> 01:09:18,403
so he could discover
the other, better world

and show everyone the way.

01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:40,221
So at the hospital,

when they confirmed his death...

1200
01:09:43,816 --> 01:09:45,993
I heard his soul calling me,

and I just knew...
I knew I had to be with him.
