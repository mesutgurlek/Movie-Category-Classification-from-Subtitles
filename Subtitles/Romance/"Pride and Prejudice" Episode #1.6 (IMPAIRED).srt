1
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,305
(MOTHER): <i>I knew it would come out right
in the end!</i>


2
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,642
My dear, dear Lydia!
She will be married.


3
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,813
My good, kind brother!
I knew how it would be.


4
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,065
I knew he would manage everything!


5
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,903
Oh, but the clothes! And of course
she must be married from Longbourn.


6
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:13,240
This is all nonsense
about her being married from Cheapside!


7
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,952
She must be married in Longbourn church,
where her friends can see her.


8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,246
That is not possible. You must see that.


9
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,624
I do not see that!
Why should I see that?


10
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,959
Why should that be?


11
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,879
She's been living
with Mr Wickham in London.


12
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,339
If she were to arrive
home unmarried still...


13
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:34,428
I suppose it must be, if you put it
like that! But it is all very vexing.


14
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:39,349
Your uncle has been most highhanded!
Why should he take so much upon him?


15
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,519
Mamma, we're greatly
indebted to Mr Gardiner.


16
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,398
He must have laid out a great deal
of money to pay off Mr Wickham's debts.


17
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,486
- More than we can ever repay.
- Why should he not?


18
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,821
Who else should lay out money,
but her uncle?


19
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:53,906
Mother!


20
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,575
Oh, well! I am so happy!


21
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,495
A daughter married.
And only just sixteen.


22
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,540
''Mrs Wickham'' . Oh, how well that sounds!


23
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,168
Oh, but the wedding clothes!


24
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,880
Lizzy, go down to your father
and ask how much he will give her.


25
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,302
(MOTHER): <i>Oh, Jane,
as soon as I am dressed</i>


26
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>I shall go to Meryton
and tell my sister Philips!</i>


27
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,973
(MOTHER): <i>Ring the bell for Hill!</i>


28
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:24,102
<i>An airing will do me
a great deal of good, I'm sure.</i>


29
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,483
(MOTHER): <i>And I shall call on Lady Lucas
and Mrs Long. Oh, Jane!</i>


30
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,609
Papa.


31
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,779
(MOTHER): <i>Jane,
it's such wonderful news!</i>


32
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:39,409
(MOTHER): <i>Oh, where is Hill?
Oh, Hill, have you heard the good news?</i>


33
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,245
Shut the door, Lizzy.


34
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,249
(MOTHER): <i>And you shall have
a bowl of punch to make merry at...</i>


35
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,757
Someone, at least,
finds pleasure in these events.


36
00:02:54,967 --> 00:03:01,557
But considering what we thought only
a few hours ago, it's not <i>so </i>bad, is it?


37
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,563
Do you think my uncle
paid out much money?


38
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,855
I do.


39
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,443
Wickham's a fool if he takes her
with a farthing less than 10,000 pounds.


40
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,196
10,000 pounds!


41
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:22,536
Heaven forbid!
How is half such a sum to be repaid?


42
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,580
I wish I had laid by an annual sum


43
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,874
to bribe worthless young men
to marry my daughters,


44
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,002
but I have not, I confess.


45
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:36,091
The reason was, of course,
that I intended to father a son.


46
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:41,138
The son would inherit the estate,
no part of which would be entailed away,


47
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,850
so providing for my widow
and any other children.


48
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,688
By the time we had abandoned hope
of producing an heir,


49
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,149
it seemed a little late to begin saving.


50
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,319
You could not have
foreseen this, father.


51
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,238
I should have taken
better care of you all.


52
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,115
The satisfaction of prevailing upon


53
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,452
one of the most worthless
young men in Britain,


54
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,996
might then have
rested in its proper place.


55
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,081
As it is, the thing is done


56
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:11,376
with extraordinary little
inconvenience to myself.


57
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,004
When you take into account
what I shall save


58
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,131
on Lydia's board and pocket allowance,


59
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,092
I am scarcely ten pounds
a year worse off.


60
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,847
I am heartily ashamed of myself, Lizzy.


61
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,559
But don't despair, it will pass...


62
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,980
..and no doubt
more quickly than it should.


63
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,842
Where is everyone?


64
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:27,202
Dearly beloved. We are gathered
here in the sight of God.


65
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,704
(UNCLE): <i>Mr Wickham is to resign</i>


66
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,748
<i>from the Militia and go
into a northern regiment.</i>


67
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,251
<i>Happily some of his former friends</i>


68
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,920
<i>are willing to assist him
in purchasing a commission.</i>


69
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,841
<i>I have written to
Colonel Forster to request</i>


70
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,594
<i>that he will satisfy
Wickham 's creditors in Brighton,</i>


71
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,138
<i>for which I've pledged myself.</i>


72
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:52,853
''Perhaps you will be so good as to do
the same for his creditors in Meryton, ''


73
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:58,316
''of whom I enclose a list
according to his information. ''


74
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,905
''I hope, at least, he has not
deceived us'' . Let us all hope so.


75
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:05,949
''As soon as they are married, ''


76
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,786
''they will journey directly
to join his regiment in Newcastle, ''


77
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,291
''unless they are first
invited to Longbourn. ''


78
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,211
Oh, yes, my dear Mr Bennet,
of course they must come here!


79
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:23,717
I long to see my dear Lydia!
And dear Wickham, too, of course.


80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,094
But it is shocking that poor Lydia


81
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,221
should have been
sent away from Brighton.


82
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,766
Such a favourite among all the officers!


83
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:35,353
There were several young men there
that she liked very much.


84
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,898
They will miss her
as much as she will miss them.


85
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,734
These northern officers
may not be so pleasant.


86
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,653
Dear Mrs Bennet,
I'm sure our youngest daughter


87
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:48,283
will find friends as silly
as she in Newcastle.


88
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,870
She has a talent for making a spectacle
of herself wherever she goes.


89
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,705
If they are to leave Brighton,


90
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,750
they should come to Hertfordshire
and reside in the neighbourhood.


91
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,128
Haye Park might do,
if the Gouldings would quit it.


92
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,882
Or the great house at Stoke,
if the drawing-rooms were larger.


93
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:09,012
- Or Purvis Lodge.
- Oh, no dear, not Purvis Lodge!


94
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,765
The attics are dreadful!


95
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,768
Mrs Bennet, before you take any,


96
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,522
or all of these houses,
let us come to a right understanding.


97
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:22,359
Into one house in the neighbourhood
they shall <i>never </i>have admittance.


98
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,696
(FATHER): <i>Mr and Mrs Wickham
will never be welcome to Longbourn.</i>


99
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,885
(LYDIA): Lord! It seems an age
since we were at Longbourn.


100
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,346
Here you all are, just the same!


101
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:55,308
My dear, dear Lydia, at last!


102
00:07:55,392 --> 00:08:00,105
Oh, I do believe you've grown!
Oh, how we have missed you.


103
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,482
We've been far too
merry to miss any of you!


104
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,488
Here we are! Haven't I caught myself
a handsome husband?


105
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:13,535
Indeed you have, my love!
You are very welcome, sir.


106
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:17,080
You are all goodness and kindness,
ma'am, as always.


107
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,082
Oh, let me give you a kiss, then!


108
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,255
Well, shall we go in?


109
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,264
No, Jane. I take your place now.


110
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,642
You must go lower,
because I am a married woman!


111
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,604
''Mrs Wickham''!


112
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,816
Lord, how droll that sounds!


113
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,838
How do you like my husband, Lizzy?


114
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:10,800
I believe you envy me.
Was he not a favourite of yours once?


115
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,219
(LIZZY): Not at all.


116
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,221
A pity we didn't all go to Brighton.


117
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,183
I could have got
husbands for all my sisters!


118
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:22,562
Thank you, but I don't particularly
like your way of getting husbands.


119
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,152
Isn't my husband a fine horseman?


120
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:33,156
Colonel Forster said he has as good
a seat as any officer in the regiment.


121
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,119
I wished he could wear
his red coat at the wedding,


122
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,122
and have a guard of honour,


123
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,750
but the officers could not
be spared from duty.


124
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,504
There was no one there
but my aunt and uncle and Mr Darcy.


125
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,381
Mr Darcy?


126
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:56,930
- (LIZZY): Mr Darcy was at your wedding?
- Oh, yes. Someone had to be groomsman.


127
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:01,851
I had much rather it had been Denny
or one of our friends... Oh, Lord!


128
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,563
Oh, Lord, I forgot.


129
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,317
I wasn't to say a word!
And I promised them so faithfully.


130
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,653
What'Il Wickham say now?


131
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,323
It was supposed to be a secret!


132
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,958
(LIZZY): <i>My dear Aunt, pray write</i>


133
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,420
<i>and let me understand
how he should have been there.</i>


134
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,505
<i>Unless you, too,
are bound in the secrecy</i>


135
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,216
<i>which Lydia seems to think necessary.</i>


136
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:38,054
<i>My dear niece, I must confess myself
surprised by your letter.</i>


137
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,266
<i>If you are in ignorance
of the part that Mr Darcy</i>


138
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,226
<i>played in bringing about the marriage,</i>


139
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:49,065
<i>let me enlighten you at once.
Mr Darcy paid us an unexpected visit...</i>


140
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:54,446
<i>..and so, my dear Lizzy,
Mr Darcy would brook no opposition.</i>


141
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,451
<i>He insisted on doing everything himself
and bearing the entirety of the expense.</i>


142
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,163
<i>Nothing was to be done
that he did not do himself.</i>


143
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,333
<i>Your uncle, instead of being allowed
to be of use to his niece,</i>


144
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,794
<i>had to accept having the credit of it.</i>


145
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,422
I must be allowed to insist on this.


146
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,426
The fault is mine,
and so must the remedy be.


147
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,386
It was through my mistaken pride


148
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,806
that Mr Wickham's character
has not been made known.


149
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:27,062
Had I not thought it beneath me
to lay my private actions open,


150
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,356
his character would have been exposed.


151
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,235
Mr Darcy, I really believe you take
too much upon yourself.


152
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,488
I must insist on this, sir.


153
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,116
I assure you that in this matter,
argument is fruitless.


154
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,787
The responsibility is mine. I must
have it, sir. I shall not give way.


155
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,087
My dear sister!


156
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,549
I'm afraid I'm interrupting
your solitary reverie.


157
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,301
You are, indeed.


158
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,888
But it doesn't follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.


159
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:06,351
I should be sorry if it were.
You and I were always good friends.


160
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,562
True.


161
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:14,150
Then shall we take
a turn together, sister ?


162
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,284
I was surprised to see
Darcy in town last month.


163
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,912
We passed each other several times.


164
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,499
I wonder what he could be doing there.


165
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:34,003
Perhaps preparing for the wedding...
with Miss de Bourgh.


166
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,297
Yes. Yes, perhaps.


167
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,676
Must have been something particular,
to take him there this time of year.


168
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,177
Undoubtedly.


169
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,601
Did you see him
while you were at Lambton?


170
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,895
I understood
from the Gardiners that you had.


171
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,523
Yes. He introduced us to his sister .


172
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,861
- Did you like her ?
- Yes, very much indeed.


173
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,113
Well, I have heard
that she is uncommonly


174
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,240
improved within this last year or two.


175
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,577
When I last saw her,
she was not very promising.


176
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,455
I'm glad you liked her.
I hope she'Il turn out well.


177
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,334
I dare say she will.
She has got over the most trying age.


178
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,423
- Did you go by Kympton?
- I don't recollect...


179
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,093
I mention it because it was the living
I should have had.


180
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,722
How should you have
liked making sermons?


181
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,058
Exceedingly well.


182
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,186
I did hear that there was a time


183
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,690
when sermon making was not
so palatable to you as at present.


184
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,734
That you actually
declared your resolution


185
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,362
of never taking orders
and were compensated accordingly.


186
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,239
Well.


187
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,287
Oh come, Mr Wickham,
we are brother and sister, you know.


188
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,207
Let us not quarrel about the past.


189
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,324
- Oh, Lydia, when shall we meet again?
- Not these two or three years, perhaps.


190
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,662
Not these two or three years.
Oh, what shall I do?


191
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,541
And Mr Bennet is so cruel as to refuse
to take us into the North Country!


192
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,712
- I should refuse to go in any case.
- Hold your tongue, girl!


193
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,383
Oh, Lydia!
You will write to me often, won't you?


194
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:48,096
I don't know. We married women
don't have much time for writing.


195
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,933
My sisters may write to me.
They will have nothing better to do.


196
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,812
Oh, Lydia!
Mr Wickham, take care of my girl!


197
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,690
I shall, ma'am,
to the very best of my ability.


198
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,191
And thank you, ma'am, and to you, sir,


199
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:03,736
for your continued
kindness and hospitality.


200
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,198
And to you, my dear sisters-in-law.


201
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,826
And now as dear to me
as sisters ever could be.


202
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,162
But, the carriage awaits.


203
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,457
Duty and honour call me to the North.
So, come, my dear!


204
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:27,260
Let us say not farewell,
but as the French have it: <i>Au revoir!</i>


205
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,855
He's as fine a fellow as ever I saw!


206
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,150
He simpers and smirks,
and makes love to us all.


207
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,610
I am prodigiously proud of him.


208
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:49,365
I defy even Sir William Lucas
to produce such a son-in-law.


209
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,898
(MRS PHILIPS): <i>Sister! Sister!
Have you heard the news?</i>


210
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,442
<i>Mr Bingley is coming
back to Netherfield,</i>


211
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,278
<i>and the whole town is talking about it!</i>


212
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,930
I do assure you, this news
does not affect me, truly, Lizzy.


213
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,644
I am glad of one thing.
That he doesn't bring any ladies.


214
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,357
If it is merely a shooting party,
we shall not see him often.


215
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:52,155
Not that I am afraid of myself... but
I dread other people's remarks, Lizzy.


216
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:57,243
Then I shall venture none...
however sorely I am tempted.


217
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:02,457
It is hard that the man
can't come to a house


218
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,792
he's legally rented,
without raising all this speculation.


219
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,919
That is just what I think.


220
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,631
- Then we shall leave him to himself.
- Yes.


221
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,014
Stop it, Lizzy.


222
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:26,063
Three days he has been in the
neighbourhood, and still he shuns us!


223
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:31,486
I say it's all your father's fault!
He would not do his duty and call,


224
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:34,155
so you shall die old maids,


225
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:38,117
and we shall be turned out by the
Collinses to starve in the hedgerows!


226
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:42,788
You promised last year that if I went to
see him, he' d marry one of my daughters,


227
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,665
but it all came to nothing.


228
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,293
I won't be sent on
a fool's errand again!


229
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,590
Mamma! Mamma, look!
I think he is coming!


230
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,141
Is it really him? I believe it must be!


231
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,977
He is come, Jane! He is come at last.


232
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,980
Put on your blue gown.
No, stay where you are!


233
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,315
(KITTY): Who's with him?


234
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,693
I don't know, dear.
Some acquaintance, I suppose!


235
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,196
It looks like that man
who used to be with him before.


236
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,491
Mr... You know, that tall proud one.


237
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,036
(MOTHER): Mr Darcy!


238
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,913
I believe it is.


239
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:29,335
Well, any friend of Mr Bingley's will
always be welcome here, to be sure.


240
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:34,423
But I must say I hate the sight of him!
But I am determined to be civil.


241
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,176
If only because the man
is a friend of Bingley's,


242
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,721
but no more than civil.
Sit up straight, Jane!


243
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,390
Pull your shoulders back.


244
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,226
A man could go a long way
without seeing a figure like yours,


245
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,562
if you' d make the most of it.


246
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,240
Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy, ma'am.


247
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,873
Mr Bingley, you are very, very welcome.


248
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,709
How do you do, Mrs Bennet. I...


249
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:14,130
It's far too long since you were here,
and very kind of you to call.


250
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,923
Mr Bennet, of course, would have


251
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,968
paid his addresses
before this, were it not...


252
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,888
Well, here you are! I am delighted!


253
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:26,559
And Mr Darcy, you are welcome, too.


254
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,278
(MOTHER): We began to be afraid
you would never come back.


255
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,280
People did say,
you meant to quit the place


256
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,826
by Michaelmas,
but I hope that is not true.


257
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,454
Ring the bell for tea, Kitty.


258
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:49,790
A great many changes have taken place
since you went away.


259
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:54,170
Miss Lucas is married.
And one of my own daughters!


260
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,465
You've heard of it
or read it in the papers ?


261
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:58,591
Yes, indeed...


262
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,593
It was not put in properly.


263
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:04,388
It only said: ''Lately, George Wickham,
Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet'' ,


264
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:08,517
without a syllable said about
who her father was, or where she lived!


265
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,687
Now they are gone to Newcastle,
and there they are to stay.


266
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,439
I don't know how long.


267
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,734
I expect you've heard
he's gone into the regulars.


268
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,320
Thank Heaven he has some friends,


269
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,448
though perhaps not as many
as he deserves!


270
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,161
Do you mean to stay long
in the neighbourhood on this visit?


271
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,123
Our plans are not yet firmly settled,


272
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:35,586
but I hope,
I hope we shall stay some weeks.


273
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,549
I hope very much
we shall stay a few weeks.


274
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,344
At the very least.


275
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,764
(MOTHER): When you've
killed your own birds,


276
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,307
I beg you would come here and shoot


277
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,810
as many as you please
on Mr Bennet's manor.


278
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,397
I'm sure he'Il be happy to oblige you!


279
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,819
I suppose you may bring your friends,
if you will.


280
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,586
(JANE): Now that this first meeting
is over, I feel at ease.


281
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:18,921
Good!


282
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,090
Now I know my own strength,


283
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,427
and I shall never again
be embarrassed by his coming.


284
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,224
We shall be able to meet now as...
common and indifferent acquaintances.


285
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:35,271
Yes, very indifferent! Jane, take care.


286
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,859
Don't think me to be
in any danger now, Lizzy.


287
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,153
I think you are in very great danger


288
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,322
of making him as much in love
with you as ever.


289
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,836
You tell me now that
she was in London all those months ?


290
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,796
And you concealed it from me?


291
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,924
Yes. I can offer no justification.


292
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,885
It was an arrogant presumption,
based on a failure


293
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:09,221
to recognise your true feelings
and Miss Bennet's.


294
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:16,729
I should never have interfered. It was
wrong of me, Bingley, and I apologise.


295
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:21,442
- You admit that you were in the wrong?
- Utterly and completely.


296
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,487
Then... I have you blessing?


297
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,573
Do you need my blessing?


298
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,994
No. But I should like to know
I have it all the same.


299
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,121
Then go to it.


300
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:55,184
Bring me my horse at once. Quick, man!


301
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,070
(MOTHER): Jane!


302
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,739
Jane! Oh, my dear Jane!


303
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,868
- Mamma, what's the matter ?
- He is come!


304
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:16,330
- Who is come?
- Mr Bingley, of course!


305
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:21,710
Make haste, make haste, hurry down!
Oh, gracious, you are not half dressed!


306
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,129
Hill! Hill!


307
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,508
Oh, where is Hill?


308
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:34,139
Never mind, Sarah. You must come to
Miss Bennet this moment!


309
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,351
Come along and help her
on with her gown!


310
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,811
Mamma! Mamma!


311
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:42,940
Where is my new locket that Lydia
brought me? Mary, have you seen it?


312
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,068
I shouldn't know it if I saw it.
I care nothing for such baubles.


313
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,988
Oh, never mind your locket, girl!


314
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,907
Jane, stir yourself.
He is here, he is here!


315
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:56,078
We will be down as soon as we can.
Let Kitty go down, she is forwarder.


316
00:24:56,162 --> 00:25:00,875
Hang Kitty! What has she to do with it?
Jane, be quick!


317
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,043
Where is your muslin dress?


318
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:06,797
(MOTHER): Hill! Hill! Where is Hill?


319
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,516
So Mr Darcy is gone to town?


320
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,561
Yes, ma'am.
He left quite early this morning.


321
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,958
What's the matter, mamma?


322
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:45,669
Why do you keep winking at me?


323
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,047
What am I to do ?


324
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,175
Wink at you?
Why should I wink at you, child?


325
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:55,804
What a notion! Why should I be winking
at my own daughter, pray?


326
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,850
But now you ask, it puts me in mind.


327
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:03,437
I do have something
I would speak to you about.


328
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,398
Come, come with me.


329
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,568
And you, Mary. Come!


330
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,507
Miss Elizabeth...


331
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:34,969
(HILL): You're needed upstairs.


332
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,962
Please let me go to Jane.
I promised I would stay with her.


333
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:14,258
Stay where you are.
Five more minutes will do the trick.


334
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:39,408
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- No. No, don't go, Lizzy.


335
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,620
(BINGLEY WHISPERS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE)


336
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,964
Well?


337
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,384
Oh, Lizzy!


338
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,139
I'm so happy! It is too much!


339
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,642
It is too much!
Why can't everyone be as happy as I am?


340
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,607
He loves me, Lizzy. He loves me!


341
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,609
Of course he does!


342
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,362
He told me he loved me all the time.
He didn't believe...


343
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:21,325
I must tell mamma.
He is gone to papa already!


344
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:26,538
Oh, Lizzy, could you believe
things would end in this happy way?


345
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:30,584
- I could, and I do!
- I must go to my mother.


346
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,586
Oh, Lizzy!


347
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:37,174
To know I shall be giving such
pleasure to all my dear family!


348
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,302
How shall I bear so much happiness?


349
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,408
Come back tomorrow, sir,
if you can bear to.


350
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,077
Come and shoot with me, if you will.


351
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,123
There are few men
whose society I can tolerate well.


352
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,208
I believe you may be one of them.


353
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,669
Thank you, sir.
I shall be very happy to.


354
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,505
Very well, very well.
Get along with you.


355
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,514
Till tomorrow, then!


356
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,987
Jane, congratulations.
You will be a very happy woman.


357
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,780
Thank you, father.


358
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,451
- I believe I shall.
- Well, well, you're a good girl.


359
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,997
I've no doubt
you'Il do very well together.


360
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,001
You're each of you so complying
that nothing will ever be resolved on.


361
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,169
Papa!


362
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,254
So easy that
every servant will cheat you!


363
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,338
No, indeed!


364
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,717
So generous that
you will exceed your income.


365
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,636
Exceed their income!
What are you talking about?


366
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,432
Don't you know that
he has 5,000 a year ?!


367
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:14,771
Oh, my dear, dear Jane! I am so happy!


368
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,857
Oh, I knew how it would be!


369
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,068
I was sure you could not be
so beautiful for nothing.


370
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:23,447
He is the handsomest
man that was ever seen!


371
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:35,709
Oh, Lizzy.
If only I could see you as happy.


372
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:39,671
If there were only
such another man for you.


373
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,592
If you were to give me forty such men...


374
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,637
..I could never be as happy as you.


375
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,350
Till I have your goodness,
I can never have your happiness.


376
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:56,188
But... perhaps if I have very good luck,


377
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,233
I may in time meet
with another Mr Collins!


378
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:25,634
Mamma, Lizzy, come and look!
The most enormous carriage has arrived.


379
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,726
(LADY CATHERINE):
What an extremely small hall!


380
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,770
(HILL): If you'Il wait here,
your ladyship,


381
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,563
I'Il tell my mistress you're here.


382
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,483
(LADY CATHERINE): No, I will not wait!


383
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:45,153
(LADY CATHERINE): Where is she?
Is this the drawing-room?


384
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,324
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.


385
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,721
That lady, I suppose, is your mother.


386
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:16,435
Yes, she is. Mamma,
this is Lady Catherine de Bourgh.


387
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,816
And that, I suppose,
is one of your sisters.


388
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:27,195
Yes, ma'am.
She is my youngest girl but one.


389
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,197
My youngest of all is lately married.


390
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,534
You have a very small park here.


391
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:40,375
And this must be a most inconvenient
sitting-room for the evening in summer.


392
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,462
Why, the windows are full west.


393
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:50,302
Indeed, they are, your ladyship,
but we never sit in here after dinner.


394
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,138
- We have...
- Miss Bennet.


395
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,224
There seemed to be a prettyish kind of


396
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:00,020
little wilderness on
one side of your lawn.


397
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,190
I should be glad to take a turn in it...


398
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:07,069
if you would favour me
with your company.


399
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:39,059
You can be at no loss to understand
the reason for my journey, Miss Bennet.


400
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,435
You are mistaken, madam.


401
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,981
I'm quite unable to account
for the honour of seeing you here.


402
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:49,778
Miss Bennet, you ought to know
I am not to be trifled with.


403
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:55,200
But however insincere you choose to be,
you shall not find me so.


404
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:00,247
A report of an alarming nature
reached me two days ago.


405
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:05,460
I was told, not only that your sister
was to be most advantageously married,


406
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,588
but that you, Miss Elizabeth Bennet,


407
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:12,968
would be soon afterwards
united to my nephew Mr Darcy!


408
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,848
Though I know it must be
a scandalous falsehood,


409
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,725
I instantly resolved
on setting off for this place,


410
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,186
to make my sentiments known to you.


411
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,354
If you believed it to be impossible,


412
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:28,108
I wonder what your ladyship
would propose by coming here?


413
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:33,321
At once to insist upon having
such a report universally contradicted!


414
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,491
Your coming to Longbourn
will be taken as a confirmation of it,


415
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,951
if such a report exists.


416
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:42,581
This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet,
I insist on being satisfied!


417
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,459
Has my nephew made you
an offer of marriage?


418
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,586
Your ladyship declared
it to be impossible.


419
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,756
It ought to be so,
but your arts and allurements


420
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,802
may have made him forget
what he owes to himself and the family.


421
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,971
You may have drawn him in!


422
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,016
If I had, I should be
the last to confess it.


423
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,853
Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?


424
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:10,150
I have not been accustomed
to such language as this.


425
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,653
I am almost the nearest relation he has,


426
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:17,157
and I am entitled to know
all his nearest concerns.


427
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,950
But not to know mine,


428
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,828
nor will such behaviour
as this induce me to be explicit.


429
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:25,123
Let me be rightly understood.


430
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:26,833
This match, to which you have


431
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:30,629
the presumption to aspire,
can never take place.


432
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:35,383
Mr Darcy is engaged to <i>my </i>daughter.
Now, what have you to say?


433
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,636
Only this: that if he is so,


434
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,473
you can have no reason
to suppose he'Il make an offer to me.


435
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,434
The engagement between them
is of a peculiar kind.


436
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,979
From their infancy they have been
intended for each other.


437
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:52,067
It was the favourite wish of his mother
as well as hers.


438
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,862
While she was in her cradle,
we planned the union.


439
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:59,366
And now to be prevented by the upstart


440
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:02,661
pretensions of a young woman
without family,


441
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:08,667
connections or fortune ?
Is this to be endured? It shall not be!


442
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,504
Your alliance would be a disgrace!


443
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:16,007
Your name would never even be
mentioned by any of us.


444
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:19,010
These would be heavy
misfortunes, indeed.


445
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:23,473
Obstinate, headstrong girl!
I am ashamed of you.


446
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:28,019
I have not been in the habit
of brooking disappointment!


447
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:31,189
That will make your ladyship's
situation at present more pitiable,


448
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,191
but it will have no effect on me.


449
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,152
I will not be interrupted!


450
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,614
If you were sensible,
you would not wish to quit


451
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,367
the sphere in which
you have been brought up!


452
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,661
Lady Catherine, in marrying your nephew


453
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:48,540
I should not consider myself
as quitting that sphere.


454
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,875
He's a gentleman,
I'm a gentleman's daughter.


455
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,419
So far we are equal.


456
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:55,714
But who was your mother ?
Your uncles and aunts ?


457
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,550
Do not imagine me
ignorant of their condition.


458
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:03,263
If your nephew does not object to my
connections, they can be nothing to you.


459
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:07,684
Tell me once and for all,
are you engaged to him?


460
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,314
I am not.


461
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:20,405
And will you promise me never
to enter into such an engagement?


462
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,575
I will make no promise of the kind,


463
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:27,370
and I beg you not to
importune me any further on the subject.


464
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:32,542
Not so hasty, if you please!
I have another objection.


465
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:38,048
Your youngest sister's infamous
elopement. I know it all!


466
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:42,052
Is such a girl to be
my nephew's sister-in-law?


467
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:46,014
Are the shades of Pemberley
to be thus polluted?


468
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,850
You can have nothing further to say.


469
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:52,187
You have insulted me
by every possible method.


470
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,731
I must beg to return to the house.


471
00:37:55,023 --> 00:38:00,779
You have no regard then,
for the honour and credit of my nephew?


472
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,908
Unfeeling, selfish girl!


473
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:08,036
You refuse to oblige me?


474
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:14,376
You refuse the claims of duty,
honour, gratitude?


475
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:22,217
You are determined to ruin him,
and make him the contempt of the world!


476
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,221
I am only resolved to act in a manner
which will constitute my own happiness,


477
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,224
without reference to you,
or to any person


478
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,559
so wholly unconnected with me.


479
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,230
And this is your final resolve?


480
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,442
Very well. I shall know how to act!


481
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,538
I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.


482
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:56,501
I send no compliments to your mother.
You deserve no such attention.


483
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,757
I am most seriously displeased.
Drive on!


484
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:25,447
Lizzy, Lizzy! I was going to look
for you. Come into my room.


485
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:36,875
I received a letter this morning,
which has astonished me exceedingly.


486
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,420
- From Mr Collins.
- What can he have to say?


487
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,130
He begins with congratulations


488
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,382
on the approaching nuptials
of my eldest daughter,


489
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,301
but I shan't sport
with your intelligence


490
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,220
by reading his remarks on that topic.


491
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:51,598
Ah, yes. Here, here, here.


492
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,267
''Your daughter Elizabeth,
it is presumed, ''


493
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,728
''will not long bear the name of Bennet, ''


494
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:01,900
''after her elder sister has resigned it,
and the chosen partner of her fate''


495
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,485
''may be reasonably looked up to''


496
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,696
''as one of the most
illustrious personages in the land. ''


497
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:12,076
Can you guess who he means, Lizzy?
Now it comes out.


498
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,121
''My motive for cautioning you
is as follows:''


499
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,582
''his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, ''


500
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,002
'' does not look on the match
with a friendly eye. ''


501
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:26,382
Mr Darcy, you see, is the man.
Mr Darcy of all men!


502
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:32,388
Who never looks at a woman except to see
a blemish! Are you not diverted?


503
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:33,723
Yes.


504
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:38,269
Mr Darcy, who probably never
looked at you in his life before!


505
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:42,398
This is admirable! But Lizzy,
you look as if you didn't enjoy it.


506
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:44,901
You're not going to be <i>Missish </i>now,


507
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,612
and pretend to be affronted
by an idle report?


508
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:51,533
Oh, no, I am excessively diverted.
It's all so strange.


509
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,744
What said Lady Catherine de Bourgh ?


510
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:57,580
I suppose she came
to refuse her consent?


511
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,666
What do we live for,


512
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:04,128
but to make sport for our neighbours
and laugh at them in our turn?


513
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,131
True, true.


514
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,060
Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy, ma'am.


515
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:23,147
- Good day to you!
- Mr Bingley.


516
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:30,113
(BINGLEY): This is a fine day.
Should we perhaps all walk to Meryton?


517
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,330
(KITTY): Lizzy!


518
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:42,959
Do you mind if I run
to call on Maria Lucas ?


519
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,752
No, not at all.


520
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,270
Mr Darcy.


521
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:06,941
I can go no longer without thanking you
for your kindness to my poor sister.


522
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,027
Ever since I have known of it,


523
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:14,866
I've been most anxious
to tell you how grateful I am,


524
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,201
for my family and for myself.


525
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:23,750
You must not blame my aunt
for telling me. Lydia betrayed it first,


526
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,961
and then I couldn't rest
till I knew everything.


527
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,466
I know what trouble and what
mortification it must have cost you.


528
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:37,597
Please let me say this,
please allow me to thank you,


529
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,310
on behalf of all my family, since they
don't know to whom they are indebted.


530
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,232
If you will thank me,
let it be for yourself alone.


531
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,860
Your family owes me nothing.


532
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:53,446
As much as I respect them,
I believe I thought only of you.


533
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,576
You're too generous to trifle with me.


534
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,913
If your feelings are what they were
last April, tell me so.


535
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,458
My affections and wishes are unchanged.


536
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,171
But one word from you will silence me
on this subject forever.


537
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,675
Oh, my feelings...


538
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,468
My feelings are...


539
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,263
I am ashamed to remember
what I said then.


540
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,433
My feelings are so different.


541
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:27,480
In fact, they are quite the opposite.


542
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,247
Lady Catherine told me
of her meeting with you.


543
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,250
I may say that her disclosure
had quite the opposite effect


544
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,710
to the one she had intended.


545
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:51,671
It taught me to hope,
that I had scarcely


546
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,298
ever allowed myself to hope before.


547
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:58,970
Had you absolutely decided against me,
you would have acknowledged it openly.


548
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:03,224
Yes, you know enough of my frankness
to believe me capable of that!


549
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,310
After abusing you so to your face,


550
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,355
I could have no scruple
in abusing you to all your relations.


551
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:11,899
What did you say of me
that I did not deserve?


552
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,527
My behaviour at the time
was unpardonable.


553
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,196
I can hardly think of it
without abhorrence.


554
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,659
Your reproof I shall never forget.


555
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:25,830
''Had you behaved in a more
gentleman-like manner'' .


556
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,332
How those words have tortured me!


557
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:31,836
I had no idea of their being
taken such a way.


558
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,004
I can easily believe it.


559
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,090
You thought me devoid
of every proper feeling, I am sure.


560
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,136
The turn of your countenance
I shall never forget.


561
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,971
You said I could not have addressed you


562
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:44,849
in any way that would
have induced you to accept me.


563
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,810
Do not repeat what I said then!


564
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:51,981
No, I have been a selfish
being all my life.


565
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,691
As a child I was given good principles,


566
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:56,986
but was left to follow them
in pride and conceit.


567
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,740
And such I might still have been,
but for you.


568
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,368
Dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!


569
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,715
(JANE): Engaged to Mr Darcy!


570
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,220
No, you are joking. It is impossible!


571
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,848
This is a wretched beginning!


572
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:29,227
If you don't believe me,
I'm sure no one else will.


573
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:34,190
Indeed, I am in earnest.
He still loves me, and we are engaged.


574
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,778
It can't be true.
I know how much you dislike him!


575
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,781
No, it is all forgotten!


576
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,243
Perhaps I didn't always love him
as well as I do now.


577
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:49,122
But... in such cases as these
a good memory is unpardonable.


578
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,625
Dearest Lizzy, do be serious.


579
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,712
How long have you loved him?


580
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,757
It's been coming on so gradually,
I hardly know.


581
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:04,720
But I believe I must date it
from my first seeing


582
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,973
his beautiful grounds at Pemberley!


583
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,226
Lizzy!


584
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:16,899
Are you out of your senses
to be accepting this man, Lizzy?


585
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,987
Have you not always hated him?


586
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:24,782
- Papa...
- I've given him my consent.


587
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:29,412
He's the kind of man, indeed, to whom
I should never dare refuse anything.


588
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,958
But let me advise you
to think the better of it.


589
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,377
I know your disposition, Lizzy.


590
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:39,964
My child, let me not have the grief


591
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,801
of seeing you unable
to respect your partner in life.


592
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,722
He is rich, but will he make you happy?


593
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,684
Have you objections apart
from your belief in my indifference?


594
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:56,022
None whatever. We all know him to be
a proud, unpleasant sort of man,


595
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,525
but this would be nothing
if you really liked him.


596
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,905
I do. I do like him.


597
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,908
I love him.


598
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:13,414
Indeed, he has no improper pride.
He is perfectly amiable.


599
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:17,501
If you only knew his generous nature.


600
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,797
I didn't always love him,


601
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,342
but I love him now so very dearly.


602
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:29,180
He is truly the best man
I have ever known.


603
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:38,648
Well, my dear, if this be the case,
he deserves you.


604
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,570
I could not have parted with you
to anyone less worthy, Lizzy.


605
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:57,708
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
in the sight of God,


606
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,753
and in the face of this congregation,


607
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:05,633
to join together this man
and this woman...


608
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:12,890
..and this man and this woman


609
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:17,311
in holy matrimony,
which is an honourable estate,


610
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:21,315
instituted by God
in the time of man's innocency,


611
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:27,238
signifying unto us the mystical union
that is between Christ and His church,


612
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:32,410
and therefore is not by any
to be enterprised lightly, or wantonly,


613
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:36,789
to satisfy man's
carnal lusts and appetites,


614
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:42,378
but reverently, discreetly,
advisedly, soberly,


615
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,213
and in the fear of God,


616
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:48,134
duly considering the causes
for which matrimony was ordained.


617
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:53,264
First, it was ordained
for the procreation of children.


618
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,104
<i>Secondly, as a remedy against sin,</i>


619
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,606
<i>and to avoid fornication.</i>


620
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:05,318
<i>Thirdly,</i>


621
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:11,115
for the mutual society, help and comfort
that the one ought to have of the other,


622
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:15,119
both in prosperity and adversity,


623
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:20,875
into which holy estate these persons
present come now to be joined.


624
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,762
Three daughters married!


625
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,265
Oh, Mr Bennet,
God has been very good to us!


626
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,267
Yes, so it would seem.
