(Gretchen moaning, Jimmy panting)

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:07,474
Oh, God. Oh, shit!

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:10,044
- Uh-huh.
- (moans)

4
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:11,963
I'm gonna come! I'm gonna come!

5
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:13,003
- Um...
- I'm gonna come.

6
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:14,578
Why do you always announce it?

7
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:16,571
- What?
- You always announce it.

8
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:18,176
- I do?
- Always.

9
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:19,328
I don't know. I guess I just want

10
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:20,842
everyone to be clear that, uh...

11
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:23,279
- That this is Gretchen's moment.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,828
Gretchen has the floor.

13
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,368
(grunting)

14
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,742
(both moaning)

15
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:32,053
- Oh, yeah. Oh, shit.
- Oh. Oh, yeah!

16
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,884
- I'm gonna...
- No! Wait.

17
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,070
Jesus. What?

18
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:36,223
Gretchen has the floor!

19
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:37,660
I don't know what to tell you.

20
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:40,293
We can, you know, both.

21
00:00:40,347 --> 00:00:41,645
Like, at the same time?

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,629
- Why not?
- I don't know.

23
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:45,931
Will it be scary?

24
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:47,618
- I don't know. It might.
- (moans)

25
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:49,636
- Wait, I can't... I can't stop it.
- Oh, me neither.

26
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:52,513
- I can't stop it. (moaning)
- Here I...

27
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:55,219
(shouting)

28
00:00:55,254 --> 00:00:57,114
(laughs)

29
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:59,303
(chuckling, panting)

30
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:02,913
(both panting)

31
00:01:02,948 --> 00:01:05,110
You were so quiet.

32
00:01:05,527 --> 00:01:06,996
You had the floor.

33
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:08,615
Aw.

34
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:10,211

Ow!

Oh, stop.

I'm gonna take a shower.

Might take a second.
I'm gonna wash my legs.

46
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,933
- You mean shave your legs?
- No.

I'm sorry?

48
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:52,323
Implying that you don't
usually wash your legs?

49
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:53,312
No.

50
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,545
You don't wash your legs?

51
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,064
No way. What am I, a sucker?

52
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:59,385
What, you take showers, and
you don't wash your legs?

53
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:03,667
What am I gonna do, like,
bend down and wash my legs?

54
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:04,714
Who has the time?

55
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:08,578
Yesterday, you spent
two hours drawing a maze.

56
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:11,679
Yeah. And how do you think I had
time to draw that sick-ass maze?

57
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,862
No wonder you haven't
finished your book, Jimbo.

58
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:15,641
Too busy washing your legs.

59
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:19,243
Yeah, it's book proposal.
And it's nearly done.

60
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,135
Hey, I forgot to mention!

61
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:24,170
Sam and the boys are having a
big secret reunion show tonight.

62
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:25,772
- You want to come?
- Nope.

63
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:27,518
It's a really important night.

64
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:28,781
Free booze.

65
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:29,995
I'll be there.

66
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,892
Mm. Love you.

67
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:35,817
What did you say?

68
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:39,370
Oh, my God, are you serious?

69
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,224
W-We said it.

70
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,135
No way! I didn't say it!

71
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,571
Uh, the night of Becca and Vernon's party.

72
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:48,745
We both said... You said it first!

73
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,556
I was blackout drunk!

74
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:51,217
Why would you take

75
00:02:51,252 --> 00:02:52,190
- anything I said seriously?
- I seriously think

76
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:54,659
- that you may have a drinking problem.
- I don't have a problem.

77
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:56,572
- You know what, I'm not gonna let this bother me.
- Maybe you have

78
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,393
a "believing things
drunk people say" problem.

79
00:02:59,576 --> 00:03:03,378
I told you, from the beginning,
I don't believe in it.

80
00:03:03,413 --> 00:03:05,334
- But you said it.
- I might also have said

81
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,592
that I don't have an
opinion on your pubic hair,

82
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:09,746
or that I was gonna help
Edgar with his résumé.

83
00:03:09,794 --> 00:03:11,254
Doesn't make them true.

84
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:15,211
(door opens, slams)

85
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:25,373
Babe.

86
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:27,529
Babe?

87
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,068
Dude with his face in my business.

88
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:33,232
EDGAR: Uh, what's the matter?

89
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:36,839
Just, um, you've been doing
that for, like, a half hour.

90
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,231
Uh, uh, attention to
detail. It's an Army thing...

91
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:41,644
When are you gonna do me already?

92
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,284
I like making you feel good.

93
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,397
Is this your way of apologizing

94
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,301
for backing out of moving in together?

95
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:50,576
If so, forgiven.

96
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,355
Anyway, who am I to look a gift... whore?

97
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,551
- Gift head?
- Gift mouth in the mouth.

98
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:57,835
There it is.

99
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:00,098
(sighs)

100
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,502
Okay.

101
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:07,069
(moans softly)

102
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:09,855
NARRATOR (over TV): For Mary,
it was one argument too many.

103
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,446
PAUL: Lindsay!

104
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:12,873
(characters shouting over TV)

105
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,175
Lindsay, come out here!

106
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,100
MAN: Your mother cannot stay indef...

107
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:22,591
Oh. Okay, let me go put on my biking Spanx.

108
00:04:22,626 --> 00:04:25,244
No, honey. You don't understand.

109
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,917
(car approaching)

110
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,509
(tires screech, horn honks)

111
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:34,920
Being back in this house, I realized

112
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:37,463
I created a life apart from you.

113
00:04:37,498 --> 00:04:38,398
All my hobbies,

114
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:40,807
my Internet activity,
my secret bank account...

115
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:41,375
Your what now?

116
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,780
All these separate things
created malignant distance

117
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,341
between us.

118
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:51,289
LINDSAY: You're throwing
away all your nerd stuff?

119
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,492
From this moment on, my sole focus

120
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,227
will be on things we can do together.

121

00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:05,328
Ah-ah-ah.

124
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,909
I have a very special evening planned.

125
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,684
- My special night?
- Tonight,

126
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,705
we launch our life, truly together.

127
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:13,942
As a family.

128
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,161
Family.

131
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:31,721
EDGAR: Breakfast...

132
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:33,329
tots.

133
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:37,081
This is completely...

134
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:38,308
brilliant.

135
00:05:38,343 --> 00:05:40,878
Why have you just thought of these now?

136
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,856
I'm more creative when I'm upset.

137
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:44,224
Oh.

138
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,027
I have a problem.

139
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,093
Mm. Having a problem is
your defining characteristic.

140
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:55,352
No, I have a real problem. Um...

141
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,037
ever since they switched
some of my meds, I've been...

142
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:01,240
having a little trouble in the bedroom.

143
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:03,609
What, night screamings?
Sleep-to-rage?

144
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:05,760
Waking up thinking, "Why am I here?

145
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:07,931
Oh, right. Yeah, I'm
freeloading off Jimmy."

146
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:11,127
No. Bed-room.

147
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:15,527
Oh, my God! Jesus, man. Are you serious?

148
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,288
It's not like nothing happens,

149
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,790
but more like it starts to happen,

150
00:06:19,861 --> 00:06:22,022
then it gets halfway there and is like...

151
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:23,817
(dopey voice): "Nope,
I'm going back to bed."

152
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,045
I've gone years now successfully
never picturing your penis.

153
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,033
And now... there it is.

154
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:34,323
Just maybe try to...

155
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:37,685
kink it back into working order, huh?

156
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,016
What have you two tried? Latex?

157
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,018
Smooshing?

158
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:42,874
Medical play? Size training?

159
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:44,628
CFNM? Funneling?

160
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:45,556
Hazyface?

161
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:47,548
Clit negging? Ladyboy?

162
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,108
Nothing. Just regular.

163
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:52,992
Well, then your penis is
clearly bored to death.

164
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:54,139
Just try something.

165
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:55,894
Maybe start with some light

166
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:57,265
role-playing.

167
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,660
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna try

168
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:02,136
and finish my breakfast without
thinking about your penis.

169
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,453
- Béchamel?
- Uh, I'm done.

170
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:09,609
(bluesy rock music playing)

171
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,223
- One, two, three.
- I already have...

172
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:12,919
Mm?

173
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,334
Okay.

174
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:18,811
Let's do Lemon Drops next.

175
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:20,171
Don't you have work?

176
00:07:20,305 --> 00:07:21,881
(scoffs) Have you seen what I do?

177
00:07:21,928 --> 00:07:23,526
Now that you mention it, I've never known.

178
00:07:23,608 --> 00:07:26,728
How does it work? Like,
with Sam. Who pays you?

179
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:28,265
The company for which I work.

180
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,565
A company hired you?

181
00:07:30,768 --> 00:07:34,069
They interviewed you and
then offered you a job?

182
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:37,555
(groans)

183
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:40,532
Ooh, let's try cosmos next, like ladies.

184
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:41,961
Cosmos. (chuckles)

185
00:07:42,023 --> 00:07:43,751
Why are you asking me questions?

186
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:45,399
It's just funny.

187
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:47,379
With this insane revelation that,

188
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:50,114
for some reason, you don't wash your legs.

189
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:51,803
No need. Water falls on them.

190
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,244
Oh, my God.

191
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,739
Anyway, had you not said anything,

192
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,338
I might have never known this fact.

193
00:07:57,652 --> 00:07:59,318
So? Chug.

194
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:03,378
So? The unknowable is terrifying, Gretchen.

195
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:06,085
That's why humanity explores.

196
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,585
To shine a light

197
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:10,653
on the frightening dark that surrounds us.

198
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:13,953
Thus, immediately upon learning
that you don't wash your legs...

199
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:15,810
itself unimportant...

200
00:08:15,872 --> 00:08:20,272
I'm now thrust into wondering:
what else don't I know?

201
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:22,830
About me? Ooh, okay.

202
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:25,616
Um, I dated two of the Baldwins.

203
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:29,205
I competed in the U.S. Teen
Nationals for show jumping.

204
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:31,163
- In horsery?
- Yes, horsery.

205
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:31,906
For ten months,

206
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:34,426
I did ink work for a
professional counterfeiter.

207
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:36,197
I've never eaten a blueberry.

208
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,615
They are doll eyes. Think about it.

209
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:40,690
Drink.

210
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:43,598
How do I not know any of this?

211
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,400
(sighs) I can't do a cartwheel.

212
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:48,121
An owl tried to kill me at Bible camp.

213
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:49,625
- What?
- Big sumbitch.

214
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:51,214
Sluiced right through the night air,

215
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,177
silent as shit. (whooshes)

216
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:54,762
- I think there's still a scar if you want...
- No, no, no, no.

217
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:56,825
What kind of camp did you say?

218
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,604
Bible camp. See, my real problem is

219
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,855
I was wearing a headband with
a cute little mouse on it.

220
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,430
Gretchen, are you religious?

221
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:03,983
- No!
- (sighs)

222
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:06,666
I consider myself more generally spiritual.

223
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:09,575
Drink.

224
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:14,175
Whew! I am hammered!

225
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,075
Are you hammered?

226
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:17,757
You're the best.

227
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,610
I'm so glad you're my boyfriend.

228
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:22,306
- Mm.
- Look, I know we weren't gonna say it,

229
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:25,110
but... screw it.

230
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:26,487
I love you, Jimmy.

231
00:09:26,553 --> 00:09:28,313
- I love you.
- I knew it.

232
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:30,673
Psyche! Nice try, dummy.
I've had five shots.

233
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,753
I could fly a plane after five shots. Bye.

234
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:39,154
He doesn't remember saying
it. Little punk-ass bitch.

235
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:42,188
I've done tons of stuff
drunk, and it all counts:

236
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:45,281
my wedding, driving school,

237
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,000
all my dentist appointments.

238
00:09:47,035 --> 00:09:50,493
Getting vag-fected by Paul's
wriggly little jizz monsters?

239
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:51,686
Ow! No! Ow!

240
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:53,665
- Don't pinch me!
- We are having this baby!

241
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,351
- It's a fresh start.
- Stop!

242
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,173
- You bitch!
- Quit it!

243
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,510
Stop it!

244
00:09:58,082 --> 00:09:59,979
We're supposed to be having a meeting

245
00:10:00,014 --> 00:10:02,387
about the secret reunion show tonight.

246
00:10:02,422 --> 00:10:04,752
You're early. It's still my lunch hour.

247
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:08,472
I will eat those later.

248
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:10,095
You're not having this baby.

249
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:11,457
(gasps)

250
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:15,380
Unfortunately, being keenly in
tune with the human condition

251
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,489
means that after hearing this
idiotic shit for the past ten minutes,

252
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:20,656
I have thoughts. Bitch,

253
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:23,149
- he does not love you.
- Oh, goddamn it!

254
00:10:23,184 --> 00:10:24,956
SAM: When you say "I love you,"

255
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,978
it's supposed to be romantic and/or highly

256
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:29,960
sexual.

257
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:32,609
Or when you're so overwhelmed by
what perfection is in front of you...

258
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:35,105
If you say the word "Jaclyn" one more time,

259
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,363
I will gag you with that
raggedy-ass bandanna!

260
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:38,891
I've never loved anyone.

261
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:41,543
I guess it's because I never
felt worthy of love in return.

262
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:45,111
Be the CEO of your own life, Gretch.

263
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,963
Don't wait for no one to say it to you.

264
00:10:46,998 --> 00:10:49,703
Every morning in the mirror,
I purse my pillow lips up

265
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:52,800
and stare into my apple
juice eyes, and I be like,

266
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:54,319
"I love you.

267
00:10:54,377 --> 00:10:56,429
"I love you, Sam.

268
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:58,329
I love you!"

269
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,211
- (exhales)
- "Apple juice eyes"?

270
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:03,489
Don't be trying to play
like they ain't rich,

271
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:05,383
delicious, apple juice.

272
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:07,527
That's why no one loves you.

273
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:10,914
Anyway, dudes don't say it with words,

274
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:12,661
they say it with actions.

275
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:15,405
Other bitch, get out of here.

276
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:18,320
We got to talk about the show.

277
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:20,413
I am all over it, Sam.

278
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:21,944
I have a press release ready to go.

279
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,767
It's a secret show!

280
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,300
No press release.

281
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:26,725
No industry whispers.

282
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,798
Um... then how will
people find out about it?

283
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,708
Real ballers' fans find out
clandestine style and shit.

284
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:35,971
Fetty Wap at the El Rey.

285
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:37,963
Schoolboy Q on the roof of The Standard.

286
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,639
Young Thug at Sufjan
Steven's broth restaurant.

287
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:42,507
No press. All packed.

288
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,824
Okay, but that's not actually how it works.

289
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,814
Gretch! No!

290
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,682
It has to be pure.

291
00:11:48,717 --> 00:11:50,383
It's a point of pride.

292
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,239
Prove to the world we ain't never slipped.

293
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,430
- (knocking)
- Hello?

294
00:11:57,197 --> 00:11:58,396
Hi.

295
00:11:58,463 --> 00:11:59,967
I was just babysitting next door,

296
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:03,503
and I got bored watching
Hulu, like we millennials do.

297
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:05,853
Oh, hi. Come in.

298
00:12:05,888 --> 00:12:08,672
Geez, nice place.

299
00:12:08,707 --> 00:12:11,708
Reminds me of my piano teacher's house.

300
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:14,748
Sometimes we sit too close
to each other on the bench,

301
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:16,417
and our side-butts touch.

302
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,468
It's ac... it's actually
my friend Jimmy's house.

303
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,085
He let me sleep here
because I was homeless...

304
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,347
Dude, this is fantasy.

305
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:22,933
Oh, right. Uh... (scoffs)

306
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:24,311
Yeah, this is my house.

307
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,993
Which I bought with a
mortgage... money loan.

308
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:29,922
Yeah, well, I just moved to
town to be a YouTube star.

309
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,942
Don't you love my widdle baby voice, Daddy?

310
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:33,984
Whoa.

311
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,642
Oh, shit. Sorry.

312
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:39,270
(deep voice): Hey, troopmate.

313
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:42,524
What happens in the foxhole
stays in the foxhole, right?

314
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,728
Shit. Sorry. Ugh. I'm not very
good at this, which is weird,

315
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:48,190
because my character work
is what got me very close

316
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,206
on three different basic cable
hidden camera prank shows.

317
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:52,186
Let's try again.

318
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,254
No, no. It-It's okay.

319
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,144
Is it me?

320
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:59,437
Is this because I farted in
front of you the other day?

321
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:03,376
Some of my new medications
apparently can have

322
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:06,873
libido-interfering characteristics.

323
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:08,788
Well, can't you just
get them to switch them?

324
00:13:08,823 --> 00:13:10,490
They have been switching them

325
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:12,622
and switching them and switching
them and switching them.

326
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:15,181
Well, your body probably

They're a promise.

And I am not ready to make that promise.

447
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:14,635
If "I love you" is like a promise,

it's just a promise

00:21:50,762 --> 00:21:51,994
(music ends)

501
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,562
- (whoops)
- (scattered applause)

502
00:21:54,637 --> 00:21:56,203
Now, as y'all know,

503
00:21:56,492 --> 00:21:59,167
me and these fools were beefin'.

504
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,724
But squabbles is normal in a family.

505
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,044
So during that time, we wrote a song

506
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,497
that really speaks to the
soul of friendship in this

507
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:09,557
incendiary cultural time.

508
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:13,635
It's called "New Phone, Who Dis?"

509
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:19,332
- (record scratching)
- Where's that simple-ass white bitch at?!

510
00:22:19,448 --> 00:22:20,421
White bitch!

511
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,123
(record scratches)

512
00:22:22,242 --> 00:22:24,023
MAN (recorded): Here's the classic sound

513
00:22:24,088 --> 00:22:26,812
- of the red-winged blackbird.
- (bird chirping)

514
00:22:26,906 --> 00:22:29,309
For our first meal,
dear wife, we are having

515
00:22:29,383 --> 00:22:32,481
hominy and poblano pepper posole,

516
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:35,096
with a warm mushroom
salad and rhubarb grits.

517
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,297
- Now, the chatters of a house wren.
- (bird chirping)

518
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:41,669
I picked up a demi-bottle
of Gewurztraminer.

519
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:44,470
Obviously, you can't have
any, so I SodaStreamed

520
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:48,484
some sparkling water with yuzu for you-zu.

521
00:22:48,518 --> 00:22:51,548
Eastern meadowlarks came
to nest in our yard...

522
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:52,861
PAUL: Interesting fact:

523
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:54,845
did you know an average ear of corn

524
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:56,998
has an even number of rows,

525
00:22:57,048 --> 00:22:58,607
usually 16?

526
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:01,491
And humans have 32 teeth.

527
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:04,146
How's that for intra-kingdom synergy?

528
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,450
I'm so happy I get to do
this with you forever, wife.

529
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:11,910
We have menus for the
next six months already.

530
00:23:11,945 --> 00:23:14,160
Thus, there are no surprises,

531
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:15,076
ever.

532
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:16,379
Okay, let's see.

533
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:19,788
Menu number two is jerk
venison with smashed yams...

534
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:24,168
- (whimpers quietly)
- ...and garlic-ginger okra. Yum!

535
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:28,390
Lastly, we have the warbles
of an American goldfinch.

536
00:23:28,425 --> 00:23:30,297
- (bird chirping)
- (echoing): Meal number three is

537
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:33,882
gomasio-spiced parsnip soup...

538
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,010
(grunts)

539
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:37,686
(exhales)

540
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:43,298
