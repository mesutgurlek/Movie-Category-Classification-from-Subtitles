Let me say, uh, we don't[br]really need to be here.

And this is like[br]a checkup for us.

Um, a chance[br]to poke around the engine...

00:00:58.79,00:01:01.88
maybe change the oil,[br]replace a seal or two.

00:01:01.99,00:01:03.96
Yeah.

00:01:05.53,00:01:07.79
[Man][br]Very well then. Let's pop the hood.

00:01:09.80,00:01:12.23
On a scale of one to 10,[br]how happy are you as a couple?

00:01:12.33,00:01:14.63
- Eight.[br]- Wait.

00:01:14.74,00:01:18.07

How often do you have sex?

00:01:32.15,00:01:35.02
I don't understand[br]the question.

00:01:35.12,00:01:38.12
Yeah, I'm lost.[br]Is this a one-to-10 thing?

00:01:38.23,00:01:41.22
Like, is one very little,[br]or is one nothing?

00:01:41.33,00:01:43.99
Because, you know,[br]tech-technically speaking...

00:01:44.10,00:01:46.97
the zero[br]would be nothing.

00:01:47.07,00:01:50.05
That's right. And if we don't know[br]what one is-What's 10?

00:01:50.14,00:01:54.17
- Yeah, 'cause 10- Oh, God.[br]- [Laughs]

00:01:54.28,00:01:57.80

Well, look at Sting's day job. Who else[br]has 60 hours a week to put in the sack?

00:02:10.49,00:02:14.66
It's not a one-to-10 scenario. It's a[br]basic question. How often do you have sex?

00:02:22.77,00:02:24.67
How about this week?

00:02:28.71,00:02:30.68

Not good.[br]We'll get him out tomorrow.

Another two cases of the G40's.[br]The grenade launchers are here.

00:32:50.00,00:32:53.66
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,[br]A.K.A. "the Tank."

- Are you serious?[br]- Yeah.

00:32:55.77,00:32:58.74
The target's being moved across[br]the border to a federal facility.

00:32:58.84,00:33:02.74
The only point of vulnerability[br]is just south of the border.

Target will rendezvous with the helicopter[br]here at a deserted airstrip.

00:33:11.92,00:33:14.55

I'm not even sure[br]it was a him.

- That sounds delicious.[br]What flavors do you have?[br]- Chocolate and vanilla.

00:38:35.04,00:38:36.94
I don't like either of those...[br]separately.

00:38:37.04,00:38:39.88
But maybe mixed together,[br]that could be... a nice little dish.

00:39:36.84,00:39:39.70
All right. We have a new target.[br]Let's find out who he is.

00:39:43.38,00:39:46.31
Jesus. [Scoffs][br]What did you do to it?

00:39:46.41,00:39:48.44
Put a campfire out with it?

00:39:49.62,00:39:51.81
Buy a new one.

00:39:51.92,00:39:54.32
This one has sentimental value[br]for its owner.

00:39:54.42,00:39:56.41
Who's that?

00:39:56.52,00:39:59.72
Well, Gwen,[br]I'm just hoping you'd tell me.

Gladys tried to kill me,[br]not with a car.

And they play cruel games on each other.[br]A-And test boundaries with each other.

00:50:51.61,00:50:53.58
- What are you talking about?[br]- I'm just saying about[br]you have to understand-

00:50:53.68,00:50:55.65
I'm hurting over here.[br]And you're talking about 13-year-old girls.

00:50:55.75,00:50:57.65
Because I'm trying[br]to get you past the hurt.

00:50:57.75,00:51:00.18
You have to understand the enemy-[br]what you're up against.

00:51:00.29,00:51:02.45
I know exactly[br]what you're thinkin'.

00:51:02.55,00:51:05.82
If she lied about that, what else[br]is it possible that she lied about?

00:51:05.92,00:51:09.12
Her job is a spy[br]to get information from people.

00:51:09.23,00:51:11.99
- French Riviera, a yacht?[br]- [Pouring Drink]

00:51:12.10,00:51:14.00
An Iranian prince?

00:51:14.10,00:51:17.23
She's supposed to get close to him[br]and gain his trust. It's disgusting.

00:51:18.74,00:51:20.80
What?[br]What are you saying?

00:51:20.91,00:51:24.84
What?[br]Your husband is the shooter?

00:51:24.94,00:51:26.84
That's impossible.

00:51:28.05,00:51:29.74
Really?

00:51:29.85,00:51:32.44
This whole thing was probably[br]planned from the beginning.

00:51:32.55,00:51:36.61
Operation Stake Out Johnny. A six-year[br]stakeout to get information from you.

00:51:36.72,00:51:38.69
Mission accomplished.

00:51:41.36,00:51:43.76
Okay.

00:51:43.86,00:51:46.06
Here's the upside.

00:51:46.16,00:51:48.19
- You don't love him.[br]- No.

00:51:48.30,00:51:51.83
You'll kill him, and nobody's[br]better at that than you are.

00:51:51.94,00:51:54.53
Thank you.

00:51:54.64,00:51:56.61
And then it'll be over.

00:52:00.48,00:52:02.17
Mm.

00:52:04.48,00:52:08.51
- [Whispers] What if she's listening?[br]- What?

00:52:08.62,00:52:11.52
Do you think it's possible[br]that she rigged the house?

00:52:11.62,00:52:13.59
- [Normal Voice] Oh, my God.[br]- Hey, dude.

00:52:13.69,00:52:17.29
It could be very possible because of[br]th-the pattern of how she's handled stuff.

00:52:17.40,00:52:19.92
It wouldn't surprise me.[br]That's probably why she doesn't like me.

00:52:20.03,00:52:22.47
- Because she heard me call her a troll.[br]- You're out of your mind.

00:52:22.57,00:52:24.97
I'm just saying it's possible. The woman[br]just tried to run you over with a car-

00:52:25.07,00:52:27.00
That she could hear you.

00:52:27.11,00:52:29.57
[Normal Voice] And I don't give a shit.[br]I hope she is listening.

00:52:29.67,00:52:32.67
[Loud] I hope you are listening, Jane.[br]You know what, I'm on to you.

00:52:32.78,00:52:35.77
You might have fooled my boy, 'cause he[br]was blinded. It's okay. She knows this.

00:52:35.88,00:52:38.48
But I'm not me.[br]I hope you're listening to me.

00:52:38.58,00:52:41.52
And I hope you know th-that I slept[br]with your friend, Jasmine. Huh?

00:52:41.62,00:52:43.11
- Shh.[br]- We're on the board.

00:52:43.22,00:52:45.66
I'm just saying we're on the board my man.[br]Come on. We're on the board.

00:52:45.76,00:52:48.23
You thought it was 37-0.[br]We got five points on the board.

00:52:48.33,00:52:52.02
I nailed Jasmine and she was[br]bad in bed, baby. Johnny, I'm not-

00:52:52.13,00:52:55.29
I know you're embarrassed, but, come on,[br]it's me. It's Eddie you're talkin' to.

00:52:55.40,00:52:57.80
The guys we work with, they don't know.[br]I'm never gonna tell them.

00:52:57.90,00:53:01.50
The people she works with probably got[br]a big laugh over this over the last six years.

00:53:01.61,00:53:03.63
But so what? Who cares?[br]That's not important.

00:53:03.74,00:53:07.23
Lookit, it's like 150 pages of a book[br]have been written.

00:53:07.35,00:53:09.71
In the first 150 pages,[br]Johnny's been a clown.

00:53:09.81,00:53:12.34
You can write[br]the last 10 pages.

00:53:12.45,00:53:15.58
You've been smoked,[br]but you can write the last 10 pages.

00:53:17.96,00:53:20.42
Great talk, man. We should[br]do it more often. It was a great talk.

00:53:20.53,00:53:23.09
- I'm proud of you.[br]- I'm gonna borrow this.

00:53:23.20,00:53:27.13
- I like where your head's at.[br]- I'll do it in the morning.

00:53:28.80,00:53:30.70
- You okay?[br]- Yep. Okay.

00:53:30.80,00:53:32.77
- Good night.[br]- Good night.

00:53:36.27,00:53:38.87
- [Door Opens, Closes][br]- [Sighing]

00:53:48.19,00:53:50.21
You don't love him.

00:53:50.32,00:53:53.42
- Good night, John.[br]- Good night, Eddie.

00:53:53.53,00:53:55.46
- Good night, Mom.[br]- [Door Closes]

00:54:12.98,00:54:14.95
[Sniffing]

00:54:43.41,00:54:45.31
Okay, girls, let's go.

00:54:45.41,00:54:49.07
Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks.[br]You know the drill.

00:55:05.20,00:55:07.10
[Sighs]

00:55:07.20,00:55:10.33

00:55:10.44,00:55:12.60
[Chattering On Videotape]

00:55:14.24,00:55:16.97
- What is this?[br]- It looks like your wedding.

00:55:17.08,00:55:19.07
- I know what it is. What are you doing?[br]- Research.

00:55:19.18,00:55:21.74
- Background on the target.[br]- This room is wrapped.

00:55:21.85,00:55:23.81
Thank you.

[Minister]... to have and to hold,[br]to love and to cherish.

00:55:26.92,00:55:31.36
- Till death do us part.[br]- [Jane] I promise.

00:55:32.79,00:55:37.29
I, John, take you, Jane,[br]for my lawfully wedded wife...

00:55:37.40,00:55:39.42

00:55:39.53,00:55:41.97
[Jasmine][br]It's all coming out of the house.

00:55:42.07,00:55:44.26
Well done, ladies.[br]Let's wrap it up.

00:55:45.97,00:55:50.60

00:55:52.14,00:55:55.17

00:55:59.68,00:56:02.21

00:56:02.32,00:56:05.55
- Hey.[br]- Ooh, pumpkin. It's a big one.

00:56:12.03,00:56:16.49
Wow. I can't believe I've never been[br]in here before. This is great.

00:56:16.60,00:56:18.54
- Let's start with the living room.[br]- Oh, yeah.

00:56:18.64,00:56:22.44
- Oh. Nice floors. They teak or something?[br]- Yeah.

00:56:23.48,00:56:25.27
Fuck if I know, Martin.

00:56:26.68,00:56:30.51
Uh, and you won[br]the Golf Masters' trophy this year.

00:56:30.62,00:56:32.24

00:56:32.35,00:56:34.61

[John][br]You've reached the Smiths.

- Well, you are still Mrs. Smith.[br]- Well, so are a lot of girls.

00:58:10.72,00:58:13.34
Careful, Jane. I can push the button[br]anytime, anywhere, sweetheart.

Baby, you couldn't find the button[br]with both hands and a map.

00:58:19.22,00:58:23.13
- Last warning. You need to disappear.[br]- [Jane] No.

You really expect me[br]to roll over and play dead?

00:58:27.13,00:58:29.36
You should be used to it[br]after five years of marriage.

00:58:29.47,00:58:31.94
Six. And I'm not leaving.

You're tellin' me you had a shot at her[br]and you didn't take it?

You're tellin’ me you had a shot at her[br]and you didn't take it?

What I'm trying to say is[br]we got all this stuff here...

and you're trying to tell me[br]you couldn't take her out?

Well, now she's a problem[br]for both of us.

01:00:33.22,01:00:35.19
Now my house is priority one.

I am so done playing games[br]with this broad.

You gotta take this bitch[br]out head-on.

Don't tell me[br]how to handle my wife.

Oh, well, so you say.

But right now you're trapped in a steel box,[br]hanging 70 floors over nothin' but air.

01:02:34.14,01:02:35.84
Oh, so this is a trap.

[John][br]It's never gonna work, honey.

It's never gonna work because[br]you constantly underestimate me.

- Do I?[br]- You have no idea who I am.

01:02:48.09,01:02:50.72
You have no idea[br]what I'm capable of.

01:02:51.93,01:02:54.09
Well, back at you, baby.

01:02:54.20,01:02:57.93
Let me guess. Shaped charge[br]on the counterbalance cable.

01:02:58.03,01:03:00.73
Two more on the primary[br]and secondary brakes.

01:03:00.84,01:03:02.70
Maybe?

- He found them.[br]- Yes. Thank you.

01:03:05.64,01:03:08.11
Did you also get the base charge[br]at the principal cable?

01:03:11.18,01:03:13.52
Promise to leave town,[br]or I'll blow it.

01:03:19.83,01:03:23.26
Okay. I give up.

Mm. Well, that[br]would be a shame...

01:07:13.16,01:07:16.53
because they would probably ask me[br]to leave once you're dead.

Why is it[br]you think we failed?

Open the door.

Back there.

Move. Move. The other way.

01:41:37.19,01:41:39.28
How's this work?

01:41:41.69,01:41:44.06
- [Groans][br]- [Jane] I told you to wait for my signal.

01:41:44.16,01:41:46.29
- You didn't wait for my signal.[br]- Well, I improvised.

01:41:46.40,01:41:48.49
- You deviated from the plan.[br]- The plan was flawed.

01:41:48.60,01:41:50.96
- The plan was not flawed.[br]- Anal.

01:41:52.34,01:41:55.20
- Organized.[br]- Jane, 90% of this job is instinct.

01:41:55.30,01:41:57.47
Your instincts set off[br]every alarm in the building.

01:41:57.57,01:42:00.10
My instincts got the job done.[br]May not have been the Jane show.

01:42:00.21,01:42:04.04
No. It was the John show. It was half-assed.[br]Like Christmas. Like our anniversary.

01:42:04.15,01:42:06.71
Like the time you forgot[br]to bring my mother's birthday present.

01:42:06.82,01:42:11.72
- Your fake mother's birthday.[br]- The point is, you are always[br]the first to break team.

01:42:11.82,01:42:14.79
You don't want a team. You-[br]You want a servant for hire.

01:42:14.89,01:42:17.72
I want someone I can count on.

01:42:17.83,01:42:20.49
- Jane, there's no air around you anymore.[br]- Oh.

01:42:20.60,01:42:22.50
Okay. What is that[br]supposed to mean?

01:42:22.60,01:42:25.53
It means there's no room for mistakes.[br]No mistakes whatsoever.

01:42:25.64,01:42:28.23
No spontaneity.[br]I mean, who can answer to that?

01:42:28.34,01:42:31.70
Well, you don't have to. Do you?[br]'Cause this isn't even a real marriage.

01:42:34.01,01:42:36.27

01:42:37.91,01:42:40.44
Well.

01:42:40.55,01:42:42.78
[John][br]So, now I realize...

01:42:42.89,01:42:45.62
you witnessed the missus and I[br]working through some domestic issues.

01:42:45.72,01:42:47.95
- Oh.[br]- That's regrettable.

01:42:49.83,01:42:53.35
But don't take that as a sign of weakness.[br]That would be a mistake on your part.

01:42:53.46,01:42:56.02
Now tell us what you know.

01:42:56.13,01:42:58.00
Why do both our bosses[br]want you dead?

01:43:00.44,01:43:02.43

01:43:06.38,01:43:08.28
Wrap it up.

01:43:08.38,01:43:12.21
Maybe it's not such a good idea[br]to undermine me in front of the hostage.

01:43:12.32,01:43:14.55
Sends a mixed message.

01:43:14.65,01:43:17.12
Sorry.

01:43:17.22,01:43:19.19

- Where was I?[br]- "A mistake on your part."

01:43:24.89,01:43:27.69
Shut up. Options.[br]I'm gonna lay out your options for you.

01:43:27.80,01:43:30.06
- Okay? Option "A."[br]- If I could-

01:43:30.17,01:43:32.46
Shut up.[br]Option "A."

01:43:32.57,01:43:35.47
You talk. We listen.[br]No pain.

01:43:35.57,01:43:37.90
Option "B."[br]You don't talk.

01:43:38.01,01:43:40.67
I remove your thumbs[br]with my pliers.

01:43:40.78,01:43:43.80
It will hurt.[br]Option "C."

01:43:43.91,01:43:48.85
I like to vary the details a bit,[br]but the punch line is you die.

01:43:51.52,01:43:53.42
- Benjamin.[br]- Okay.

01:43:53.52,01:43:57.15
- We're impatient people.[br]- Okay.[br]- [Sighs]

Or a juice or, uh, some-

- [Phone Bell Dings][br]- [Groans] "A." "A." Option "A." Aaah!

01:44:09.94,01:44:12.70
- Oh, that hurt.[br]- Okay. That was a nice shot.

- What's-You got a spasm?[br]- [Chuckles]

01:44:20.22,01:44:23.52
I'm tied up.[br]Why don't you check my back pocket?

01:44:31.89,01:44:34.19
I'm not the target. You are.

01:44:34.30,01:44:37.60
Both of you.[br]They found out you're married...

01:44:37.70,01:44:40.97
so they teamed up and sent you[br]to the same hit to target each other.

01:44:41.07,01:44:43.73
It was a joint task force[br]by both your companies.

01:44:43.84,01:44:47.94
Two competing agents living under[br]the same roof. It's bad for business.

01:44:48.04,01:44:51.41
- They wanted you to take each other out.[br]- You were bait.

Well, it's entry level.[br]Toehold into the company.

01:44:55.99,01:44:57.89
Couple hits,[br]they bump me up to a desk.

01:44:57.99,01:44:59.89
It's pretty cool actually.

01:44:59.99,01:45:01.89
You keep the photo[br]in your back pocket?

01:45:01.99,01:45:05.02
- What was I supposed to do? Frame it?[br]- You get rid of it. You burn it.

01:45:05.13,01:45:07.43
- Tradecraft 101.[br]- I'm sorry. I guess I skipped that day.

01:45:07.53,01:45:10.26
Just like I guess you skipped the day[br]about not marrying the enemy.

01:45:10.37,01:45:13.67
You were bait,[br]or you are bait?

01:45:18.01,01:45:20.20

[Benjamin] Hey, I think I chipped my tooth.[br]Do you know if we have dental?

01:46:22.51,01:46:25.27
My way out is a boat[br]standing by in La Paz.

01:46:28.44,01:46:31.47
Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what?

01:46:31.58,01:46:34.14
So, at least, apart,[br]we know what the odds are.

01:46:36.69,01:46:39.81
Let's just call this what it is...

01:46:39.92,01:46:41.86
and what it isn't.

01:46:46.93,01:46:48.83
All right.[br]So it's a crap marriage.

01:46:48.93,01:46:51.87
All right. I'm a mess.[br]You're a disaster.

01:46:51.97,01:46:53.87
We're both liars.

01:46:56.37,01:46:58.27
But you run,[br]you'll always be running.

Oh, what is that?
