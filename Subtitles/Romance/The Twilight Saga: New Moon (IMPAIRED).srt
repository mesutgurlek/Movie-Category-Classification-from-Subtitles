1
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,240
<I>These violent delights
have violent ends...

2
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,840
<I>And in their triumph die,
like fire and powder...

3
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,320
<I>Which, as they kiss, consume...

4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,520
Gran?

5
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,680
Edward, don't!
She will see you.

6
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Okay.

7
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,120
Grandma, I would like
you to meet...

8
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
Happy birthday, Bella.

9
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,880
Happy birthday, Bells.

10
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,560
I thought we agreed,
no presents.

11
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,960
Well, the one from me
is not wrapped.

12
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,840
So, don't count.

13
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,640
It's actually great.
Thanks, Dad.

14
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,600
Uh, goes with this one
from your mom.

15
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,320
We coordinated.
Well, she coordinated me.

16
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,000
It's to put your pictures in,
from senior year.

17
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,880
Senior year.

18
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,680
How'd you get so old so fast?
- I didn't.

19
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,360
It's not that old.
- I don't know.

20
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,120
Is that a grey hair?

21
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,760
No! No way!

22
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,400
Happy Birthday.

23
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,040
It's really funny.

24
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,720
<I>Another missing hiker brings
the total to three presumed deaths.

25
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,800
<I>The Rangers are searching
for the killer animal...

26
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,880
Oh, it's Bella.
Bella!

27
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,280
Today is the big day, Bella.

28
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,560
Uh, R and J essay due?
- Oh, yeah!

29
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,280
Wherefore art thou, Bella?

30
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,960
I want to take a picture of you guys.
My Mom...

31
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,880
...wants me to put together, like...

32
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,160
...a scrapbook full of memories.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

33
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,000
I take them, I'm not in them.
- No, no, no, come here.

34
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,560
You'll Photoshop my nose
if it looks big, right?

35
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,320
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

36
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,680
It's good.

37
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,840
Oh, good.
Cullen's here.

38
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
Well, catch you later.

39
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,600
Happy birthday.
- Don't remind me.

40
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,400
Bella, your birth is definitely
something to celebrate.

41
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
But my aging is not.
- Your aging?

42
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,520
I think 18 is all youngster,
don't worry about that.

43
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,320
It's one year older than you.

44
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,400
No, it isn't.

45
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,880
I'm a hundred and nine.
- Wow!

46
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,560
Maybe I should not be dating
such an old man.

47
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,600
It's gross!

48
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,400
I should feel certainly repulse.

49
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,600
We have to go to class.
- Yeah.

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,520
Wait a second.

51
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,120
Someone wants you.

52
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,200
Bella.
- Jacob!

53
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,880
I'll leave you to talk.

54
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,160
Hello, biceps!

55
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,120
You know, anabolic steroids are
really bad for you.

56
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,440
Well, I'm just filling out, Bella.

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,120
You know, wouldn't seem so drastic
if we hung out more.

58
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,000
We should switch schools.

59
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,680
Then you can come hang out
with the pale faces.

60
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm alright.

61
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,280
I prefer the Res school's exclusivity.

62
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,160
They let any old rift raft into this place.

63
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,440
I see.
Why are you summing it?

64
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,000
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

65
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,640
You should really come, take a ride,
when it's done.

66
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,080
Is it fast?
- Huh, it's decent.

67
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,720
Okay.
- Okay, good.

68
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,600
Hey, happy birthday.

69
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,880
Your Dad told my Dad.
So...

70
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,680
Yeah, of course, he did.

71
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,400
I saw this the other day and
thought of you.

72
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,360
It catches bad dreams.

73
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,080
It's perfect.

74
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,520
Thank you.
- No problem.

75
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,480
See you soon. Bye.
- Yeah, see you later.

76
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,880
So, how come Jacob Black gets to
give you a gift and I don't?

77
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,480
Because I have nothing
to give back to you.

78
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,920
Bella, you give me everything
just by breathing.

79
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,960
See? Thank you.
That's all I want.

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,200
Bella!

81
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
Happy Birthday!
- Shhh!

82
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,040
I thought, I said you,
no presents.

83
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,120
I've already seen you open it
and guess what?

84
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,600
You love it!

85
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,160
You're goanna wear it tonight,
our house.

86
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,520
Come on, please?
It will be fun.

87
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,240
Okay. alright.
- Great! Okay, I'll see you at 7:00.

88
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,200
Jasper, no fair
with the mood control thing.

89
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,400
Sorry, Bella.

90
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,080
Happy...

91
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,400
Never mind.

92
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,720
You can't trust vampires.

93
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,400
Trust me!

94
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,480
<I>O, my love!
My wife!

95
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,240
<I>Death that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath.

96
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,840
<I>Hath had no power yet
upon thy beauty.

97
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,560
<I>Thou art not conquered.

98
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,440
<I>Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips
and in thy cheeks.

99
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,440
<I>And death's pale flag
is not advanced there.

100
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,880
<I>I hate being celebrated.

101
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,600
<I>There are worse tragedies.

102
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,920
<I>Him, look at Romeo.

103
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,560
<I>He kills his true love
out of sheer stupidity.

104
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,080
Yeah.

105
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,520
Though I do envy him,
one thing.

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,720
Juliet. She's like perfect.

107
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,760
If you like that obviously
beautiful sort of thing.

108
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,080
No, not the girl, dear.

109
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,520
The suicide.

110
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,760
It's nearly impossible for...

111
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,520
...some people.

112
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,080
For humans,
a little poison...

113
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
...a dagger to the heart...

114
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
So many different options.

115
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,840
Why would you say that?

116
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,080
Because I considered it once.

117
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,720
I didn't know,
if I'd get to you in time.

118
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,800
I had to come up with
some kind of...

119
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,240
...plan.

120
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,480
And what was the plan?

121
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,440
I would go to Italy,

122
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,840
...and provoke the Volturi.

123
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,320
The what?
- The Volturi...

124
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,600
Now, who would like to repeat
the last few lines...

125
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,880
just to show,
they were paying attention?

126
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,040
Mr. Cullen.

127
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,800
Oh, yes, Mr. Birdy.

128
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,880
O, here.

129
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,080
Will I set up my everlasting rest,

130
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,680
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

131
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,160
Eyes, look your last!

132
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,440
Arms, take your last embrace!

133
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,520
And lips, O you,
the doors of breath,

134
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,360
...seal with a righteous kiss.

135
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,160
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!

136
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,240
Eyes on the screen, people.

137
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,080
<I>Thus with a kiss I die.

138
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,320
The Volturi are a very old,
very powerful family.

139
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,400
I guess, the closest thing to royalty
my world has.

140
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,360
Is that Carlisle?
- Yeah.

141
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,080
He lived with them
for a few decades.

142
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,600
Described them as
very refined.

143
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,000
No respect for human life,
of course, but...

144
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,160
...respect for the arts
and science as at least.

145
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,600
<I>And the law...

146
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,480
<I>...above all of law.

147
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
<I>And vampires have laws?

148
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
<I>Not very many.

149
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,840
<I>There's only one and
it's regularly enforced.

150
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
<I>What is it?

151
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,520
<I>To keep the existence
of our kind a secret.

152
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,600
<I>We don't make spectacles
of ourselves,

153
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,960
<I>And we don't kill conspicuously.

154
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,400
<I>Unless, of course,
you want to die.

155
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,120
We have to talking about that.

156
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,160
I can't even think...

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,880
...about someone hurting you.

158
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,320
Bella, the only thing that
can hurt me is you.

159
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,240
And I don't have anything else
to be afraid of.

160
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,880
That's not true.

161
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,920
Victoria?
She will come for me one day.

162
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,280
Alice will see
what she decides and...

163
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,080
...we will be ready.
- I can protect you.

164
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,120
If you change me.

165
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,640
Bella, you already do protect me.

166
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,280
You're my only reason...

167
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,160
...to stay alive,
if that's what I am.

168
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,760
But it's my job to protect you.

169
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,920
From everyone except my sister.

170
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,120
It's time!

171
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,120
It's time! It's time!
It's time!

172
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,760
Sorry about all this.
We tried to rein Alice in.

173
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,200
Like it's even possible.

174
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,160
Happy big Birthday, Bella!
- Thanks.

175
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,920
I found it in your bag, mind?

176
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,800
Dating an older woman?
Hot!

177
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,760
What?

178
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,400
You first, Rosalie.

179
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,520
It's a necklace.

180
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,400
Alice picked it up.
- Thanks.

181
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,200
Show me the love!

182
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,640
This is from Emmett.

183
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
Already installed it in your truck.

184
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,960
Finally, a decent sound system
for that piece of...

185
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,240
Hey, don't... don't hate the truck.

186
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,480
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

187
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,480
Just a little something
to brighten your day.

188
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,440
We think, you looking
kind of pale lately.

189
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,440
Paper cut.

190
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,480
Jas... Jas!

191
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,960
It's okay.
It's just a little...

192
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,080
...blood.

193
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,200
Get Jasper out of here.

194
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry, I can't.

195
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,920
I'll have to stitch this up
in my office.

196
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,240
Check on Jasper.

197
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,520
I'm sure, he's very upset with himself.

198
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,160
And I doubt he'll listen to anyone
but you right now.

199
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,760
Edward?

200
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,400
I never wanted that party.
- It's not your fault.

201
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,600
Jasper hasn't been away from human blood
as long as the rest of us.

202
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,880
How do you do it?

203
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,160
Years and years of practice.

204
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
Did you ever think it of...

205
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,960
...just doing it the easier way?

206
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,160
No.

207
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,360
I knew who I wanted to be.

208
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,400
I wanted to help people.

209
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,200
Brings me happiness.

210
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
Even if I'm damned about this.

211
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,400
Damned?

212
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,080
Like... like hell?

213
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,160
Carlisle, you can't be damned.

214
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,440
You couldn't, it's impossible.

215
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,520
Thank you, Bella.

216
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,720
You always been very...

217
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,080
...gracious about us.

218
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,320
So, that's it?

219
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,480
That's why he won't change me?

220
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,480
Imagine the situation in reverse.

221
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
If you believed as Edward does...

222
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,560
...would you take away his soul?

223
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,040
You can't protect me.

224
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,440
From everything.

225
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,600
At some point,
something's goanna separate us.

226
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,240
It's goanna be an accident,

227
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,000
...or illness,

228
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,240
...or old age.

229
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,440
As long as I'm human.

230
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,040
And the only solution
is to change me.

231
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,000
That's not a solution,
it's a tragedy.

232
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,840
You're not goanna love me
when I look like a grandmother.

233
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,040
Bella, do you not understand
my feelings for you? No?

234
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,040
Carlisle told me...

235
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,000
...how you feel about your soul.

236
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,680
I don't believe that.

237
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,640
So don't worry about mine.

238
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,000
You should go inside.

239
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
It's still my birthday.

240
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,920
Can I ask one thing?

241
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,200
Kiss me?

242
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,000
I love you.

243
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
I love you.

244
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,720
Hi.

245
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,040
Come for a walk with me.

246
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,640
We got to leave Forks.

247
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,600
Why?

248
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,760
Carlisle's supposed to be
ten years older than he looks.

249
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,280
People are starting to notice.

250
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,880
Okay, I...

251
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,000
I got to think of something
to say to Charlie.

252
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,880
When you say "we"...

253
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,480
I mean to my family and myself.

254
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,720
Edward, what happened with Jasper,

255
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,840
...it's nothing.
- You're right.

256
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,360
It was nothing.

257
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,200
Nothing the way
I always expected.

258
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,280
And nothing compared to
what could have happened.

259
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,160
You just don't belong
to my world, Bella.

260
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,360
I belong with you.

261
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No, you don't.

262
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,400
I'm coming.

263
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,800
Bella.

264
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,080
I don't want you to come.

265
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,200
You don't want me?

266
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
No.

267
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,280
This changes things.

268
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,640
alright.

269
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,480
But if it's not
too much to ask...

270
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,520
...can you at least
promise me something?

271
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,320
Don't do anything reckless.

272
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,120
For Charlie's sake.

273
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,720
And I'll promise something
to you in return.

274
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,600
This is the last time
you'll ever see me.

275
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,320
I won't come back.

276
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,120
And you can go on
with your life...

277
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,400
...without any interference from me.

278
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,000
It will be like...

279
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,000
I never existed,
I promise.

280
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,080
If this is about my soul, take it.

281
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,280
I don't want without you.
- It's not about your soul.

282
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,560
You're just not good for me.

283
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,880
I'm not good enough for you?

284
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,920
I'm just sorry,
I let this go on for so long.

285
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,200
Please...

286
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,200
...don't.

287
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
Goodbye.

288
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,400
Edward?

289
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,400
Edward!

290
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,120
Edward!

291
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,400
I'll try to call Cullen’s place again.

292
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,920
The Cullen’s left town, Charlie.
- Good riddance!

293
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,880
Where did they go?

294
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,800
We'll find her, Charlie.
- Thanks, Harry.

295
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,160
Charlie?

296
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,440
She's alright.

297
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,560
I got her.

298
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,400
Thank you, Sam.

299
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,320
<I>Alice,

300
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,040
<I>...you have disappeared.

301
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,640
<I>Like everything else.

302
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,520
<I>But who else can I talk to?
I'm lost.

303
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,560
<I>When you left...

304
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,360
<I>and he left...

305
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,400
<I>You took everything with you.

306
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,560
<I>But the absence of him
is everywhere I look...

307
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,440
<I>It's like a huge hole...

308
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,520
<I>...has been punched through my chest.

309
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,600
<I>But in a way I'm glad.

310
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,840
<I>The pain is my only reminder that
he was real...

311
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,880
<I>...that you all were.

312
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,240
alright, that's it.

313
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,640
What?

314
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,040
You're going to Jacksonville
to live with your mother.

315
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,440
I'm not leaving Forks.

316
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,280
Bells...

317
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,680
...he's not coming back.

318
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,400
I know.

319
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,520
It's just not normal,
this behaviour.

320
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,120
Quite frankly, it's scaring
the hell out me,

321
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,840
...and you Mother.

322
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,720
Baby, I... I don't want you to leave.

323
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,600
I don't.

324
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,640
But... just go...

325
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,640
Go to Jacksonville,
make some new friends...

326
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,120
I like my old friends.
- Well, you never see them anymore.

327
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,120
I do, yeah.

328
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,360
I'm...

329
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,760
...goanna go shopping tomorrow,
with Jessica.

330
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,440
You hate shopping.

331
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,800
I...

332
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,520
I need a girl's night out.

333
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,880
alright.
Girl's night.

334
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,400
Shopping.

335
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,360
I like it, go.

336
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,480
Buy some good stuff.

337
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,480
<I>Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.

338
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,320
<I>Oh, yeah, Bella Swan.

339
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,200
I don't know, why you want to sit through
all those zombies eating people,

340
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,600
...and no hot guys kissing anybody.
It's gross.

341
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,880
Like why there are
so many zombie movies anyway?

342
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,280
Is it supposed to like
draw a parallel with leprosy?

343
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,360
My cousin had leprosy,
it's not funny, you know?

344
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,440
And like is it supposed to be
a metaphor for consumerism?

345
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,440
Because don't be so pleased with
your own like...

346
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,120
...self-reverential cleverness, you know?

347
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,000
Like, some girls like to shop.

348
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,800
Not all girls, apparently.

349
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,640
I was surprised
you called at all, you know?

350
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,480
Like, your depression thing.
I'm totally... totally worried.

351
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,440
After a while, it's like,
she's still bumming?

352
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,720
And I'm going through
stuff too, you know?

353
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,720
Like Mike deciding
he wanted to "I just be friends? "

354
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,560
That's hard, you know?

355
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,080
<I>What's up, guys?

356
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,480
<I>Where you going?

357
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,080
<I>Keep walking.

358
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,480
<I>This is dangerous.

359
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,000
Dude, come on.

360
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,280
I think, I know those guys.

361
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,880
Well, they seem great.
Can we go?

362
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,240
I just need to see something.

363
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,320
<I>Hey, girlie!

364
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,160
alright, alright!
We got a taker.

365
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,720
<I>Turn around.

366
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,240
Sorry, I thought
you were somebody else.

367
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,360
That's cool! I'll be whomever
you want to be, honey.

368
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,280
So, what do you say?

369
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,040
<I>You promised me nothing reckless.

370
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,720
You promised, it would as
you never existed.

371
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,040
You lied.
- Say some, babe?

372
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,200
You know what?
Never mind.

373
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,080
Stop!

374
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,880
Stop! Stop!
Stop!

375
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,280
Hey, um, what the hell is
wrong with you?

376
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,760
Just curious.

377
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,560
I thought that I saw something.

378
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,760
You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.

379
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,640
That homeboy
could have been a psycho.

380
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,920
I was about to end up
in a FBI interview room,

381
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,920
...like some lame TV show.

382
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,280
Oh, that was such a rush.

383
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,640
Awesome!

384
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,600
So, you're an adrenaline junky now?

385
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,840
That's cool!
You can go bungee jumping.

386
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,280
You don't get on the back of some
random loser's motorcycle!

387
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,680
Crazy!

388
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,040
<I>Alice, I saw him.

389
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,480
<I>Maybe I'm crazy now,
but I guess that's okay.

390
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,600
<I>If the rush of danger is
what it takes to see him...

391
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,160
<I>...then that's what I'll find.

392
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,800
Bella!

393
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,960
Where the hell have you been, crazy?

394
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,320
I... brought you something.
- Okay.

395
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,040
It's a little crazy.

396
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,240
Wow, scrap metal!

397
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,760
You shouldn't have.
- I saved them from the junkyard.

398
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,880
I think, they'll probably cost
more to fix than they're worth.

399
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,880
...but then I thought that...

400
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,800
if I had a mechanic-type friend
to help me out,

401
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,200
Huh, me?

402
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,480
Being the mechanic-type friend?
- That's right.

403
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,480
Since when are you into motorcycles?
- Since now.

404
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,320
I get it if you think this is
really stupid and reckless.

405
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,520
Yeah, it's completely
stupid and reckless.

406
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,960
When do we start?

407
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,480
Now. Please.
- alright.

408
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,920
Oh, hey, be careful.
These things are actually really...

409
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,520
...heavy. So,

410
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,520
Jacob, you're like buff.

411
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,360
How that can happen?
You're like 16, I don't get it.

412
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Age is just a number, baby.
What, you're like 40, now?

413
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,480
Feels like that sometimes.

414
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,480
That song was good.
You don't like it?

415
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,640
I don't really like...

416
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,680
...music anymore kind of...

417
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,800
Okay.
No more music.

418
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,800
I was thinking,
if we're goanna do this every day,

419
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,560
...and hopefully we will...

420
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,360
We have to, like, fit some homework
in there somewhere.

421
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,360
I don't want Billy thinking that
I'm a bad influence on you.

422
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,240
You influence me?
Please.

423
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,560
Are you...?
I'm older than you.

424
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,160
So that makes me the influencer
and you the influence.

425
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,760
No, no, no.

426
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,560
My size and knowledge base actually
makes me older than you.

427
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,000
Because of your gentle paleness
and lack of know-how.

428
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,720
I convinced you to build
two-wheeled death machines with me.

429
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,000
Don't you think that makes
you funny, young and naive?

430
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,760
Okay.
So, where do we stand?

431
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,080
I'm thirty five...

432
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,480
...and you might be like 32.
- Come on.

433
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,520
 Jake, you in there?
- No, it's okay.

434
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,200
It's... It's just my boys.

435
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,280
Hey, Jake.
- Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

436
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,880
Bella, that's Quill and Embry.

437
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,200
I'm Quill Ateara.

438
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,160
So the bike building story is true.

439
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,320
Oh, yeah, yeah!
I taught him everything he knows.

440
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,840
What about the part
where you're his girlfriend?

441
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,720
Uh, we're friends, you know?
- Hmm. Burn!

442
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,440
Actually, I remember, I said
she's a girl and a friend.

443
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,520
Embry, do you remember him
making that distinction?

444
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,400
Nope!

445
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,040
So you guys have girlfriends.
It's awesome.

446
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,400
Yeah, right.

447
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,120
Quill’s actually taken his cousin to prom.

448
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,600
Yeah, that's still a riot.

449
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,600
You want funny, Black?
I'll give you funny.

450
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,280
Jesus!

451
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,040
I got five bucks on Quill.
- You're on.

452
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,760
<I>Dear Alice, I wish,
I had your real address.

453
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,760
<I>I wish, I could tell you
about Jake.

454
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,400
<I>He makes me feel better.

455
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,680
<I>I mean,
he makes me feel alive.

456
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,720
<I>The hole in my chest...

457
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,600
<I>...while when I'm with Jake,

458
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,400
<I>It's like, it almost healed.
For a while.

459
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,880
Quill keeps asking to come over.

460
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,320
I think he likes you
a little too much.

461
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,160
Oh, I'm really not into
the whole cougar thing, you know?

462
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,320
What's up with you and age?

463
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,360
I mean, how old was that
Cullen guy anyway?

464
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,880
<I>But even Jake can't keep
the dreams away.

465
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,480
Hey, Bella!

466
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,920
You're alright. You're okay?
- No.

467
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,120
I thought this thing was
starting to work,

468
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,160
...but I guess not.

469
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,120
Can I ask you something?

470
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,960
Hanging out with Jacob...

471
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,720
...does seems to take your mind
off things for a bit, doesn't it?

472
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
You know, sometimes...

473
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,440
...you got to learn to love
what's good for you.

474
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,280
You know, what I mean?

475
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,240
Of course, what do I know?

476
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,520
I'm just a terminal bachelor.

477
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,600
Famous ladies man.

478
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,640
Okay...

479
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,040
Go to bed.

480
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,600
I love you.

481
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,920
If I told you,

482
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,320
...I couldn't have fixed these bikes,
what would you say?

483
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,240
Are you doubting your mad skills?

484
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,680
No, definitely not.
I mean, they're all fine.

485
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,120
It's just...

486
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,960
May be if I was smarter
would have dragged out to rebuild them.

487
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,960
If you told me,
you couldn't fix these bikes.

488
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,920
I would say that that's...

489
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,440
...really too bad but...

490
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,800
...he's goanna find something else to do.

491
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,160
Is that Sam Utley?

492
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,960
Yeah, and his cult.

493
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,720
Oh, my God!

494
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,560
Did you see that?

495
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,560
They're not really fighting, Bella.

496
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,400
They're cliff diving.

497
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,480
Scary as hell,
but a total rush.

498
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,920
Rush?
- Most of us jump from lower down.

499
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,240
We'll leave the showing off
to Sam and his disciples.

500
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,760
Is some kind of beef
with them or something?

501
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,200
Oh, no.

502
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,520
They just think they run this place.

503
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,440
Embry used to call them hall
monitors on steroids.

504
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,160
Now, look at him.
- That's Embry?

505
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeah.
- What happened to him?

506
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,000
He missed some school...

507
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,080
...and all of a sudden started following
Sam around like a little puppy.

508
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,480
Same thing with Paul and Jared.

509
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,080
Sam keeps giving me this look,

510
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,520
...like he's waiting for me
or something.

511
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,200
It's kind of starting to freak me out.

512
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,800
Well, you should just avoid him.

513
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,800
I'll try.

514
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,240
Okay.

515
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,520
You look scared.
- I'm not.

516
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,680
Alright! Brake.

517
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,360
Clutch. Good.

518
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,880
Gas.

519
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,680
Ready?

520
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,720
Now slowly... release the clutch.

521
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,200
<I>Bella.

522
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,840
<I>Stop.

523
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,400
You alright?

524
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,000
I'm goanna go again.

525
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,320
Hit the brake!

526
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,520
I want to go again.
- Are you trying to get yourself killed?

527
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,120
I'll try again.
- No, forget it.

528
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,560
No more bikes.

529
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,160
Man, your head.

530
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,440
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

531
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,160
You're apologizing for bleeding?

532
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,440
Yeah, I guess, I am.

533
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,440
It's just blood, Bella.
No big deal.

534
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,080
What are you staring at?

535
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,600
You're sort of beautiful.

536
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,840
How hard did you hit your head?

537
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,520
I don't know.

538
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,120
Let's go.

539
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:09,080
I did see something in the woods.
- Sure, baby, I believe you.

540
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,680
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.

541
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,720
It was jet black and huge.

542
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:19,280
On all fours, it was still taller
than a person.

543
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,880
A bear, may be?

544
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,160
Or an alien.
You're lucky that you didn't get probed.

545
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,520
Oh, yeah.

546
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,200
Well, I saw it.

547
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,400
You're not the only one.

548
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,680
My Dad's been getting reports
at the station.

549
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,920
Like five hikers been killed by some bear.

550
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,840
But they can't find the bear.

551
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,760
Last time you clowns
doubt my girlfriend.

552
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,840
So, I mean...

553
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,240
Bella is back.

554
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah, I guess so.
- Huh, that's... Welcome.

555
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,360
So listen, not now that...
You know, you're talking and...

556
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,160
...eating again, you know?

557
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,080
You got to get that protein in there.

558
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,680
I was just wondering,
if you wanted to go see a movie with me.

559
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,200
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, I do.

560
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,280
Cool, um, let me see...

561
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,920
We could check out
"Love spelled backwards is love. "

562
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,320
Yeah, it's a dumb title,
but, um, it's a romantic comedy.

563
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,360
I mean, it's supposed to be.
- No. No romance.

564
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,440
How about "Face Punch"?
You heard of that?

565
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,360
Well, it's an action movie.
- Yeah, it's perfect.

566
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,360
With guns... adrenaline...

567
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,440
...it's my thing
- Okay.

568
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,840
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see...

569
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,360
..."Face Punch"?
- "Face Punch"? Yeah!

570
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,000
Mike, hey, we were supposed
to watch that?

571
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,800
Remember the trailer's like...
- Yeah?

572
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,960
Punch his face in.
- I don't remember that.

573
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,000
Movie night with Bella!

574
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,880
So, "Face Punch", huh?
You like action movies?

575
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,080
Not really.

576
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,040
I heard it sucks. Bad.

577
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,240
Hey, are you even old enough
to see this movie?

578
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,360
I mean, you know, without adult supervision?
- Right, yeah.

579
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,560
Well, she's buying my ticket for me.
- She's buying it, okay.

580
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,880
Jessica bailed
and Angela's got the stomach flu

581
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,840
...so Eric's taking care of her.

582
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,400
So, it's just us three.
- Great.

583
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,320
Great.
- Yeah.

584
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,200
<I>Put the gun down.

585
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,280
<I>Put your gun down or I'm goanna
blow your freaking head off.

586
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,120
<I>Both of you!

587
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:02,480
<I>Put both of your guns down or I'm goanna
blow both of your freaking heads off.

588
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,360
<I>Alright, let's do this!

589
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,800
Okay, I think I'm goanna throw up!

590
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,000
Jesus!
- What a marshmallow!

591
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,040
You should hold out for someone
with a stronger stomach.

592
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,760
Someone who laughs at the gore
that makes weaker men vomit.

593
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,480
Yeah, I'll keep my eye open for that.

594
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,520
I feel bad.
He probably has that flu that's...

595
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,880
...going around.

596
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,160
What? I can't hold your hand?
- No, of course, you can.

597
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,080
I just think it means
something really different to you.

598
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,280
So...

599
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,800
Okay, tell me something.
You like me, right?

600
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,400
And you think, I'm sort beautiful?

601
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,480
Jake, please...
don't do this.

602
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,240
Why?

603
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,360
Because you are about
to ruin everything.

604
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,360
And I need you.

605
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,320
Well, I've got loads of time.

606
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,000
I'm not goanna give up.

607
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,040
I don't want you to.

608
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,760
But...

609
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,480
It's just because I don't want you
to go anywhere.

610
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,960
It's... it's really selfish.

611
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,760
You know, I'm not like a car
that you can fix up.

612
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,720
I'm never goanna run right.

613
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,960
So I should be fair to you.

614
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,280
It's because of him, right?

615
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,960
Look, I know what he did to you.

616
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,720
But, Bella, I would never,
ever do that.

617
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,880
I won't ever hurt you.
I promise.

618
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,320
I won't let you down.

619
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,920
You can count on me.

620
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,800
Well...

621
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,200
I need to go home.

622
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,560
I'm... I was feeling sick
before the movie, okay?

623
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,400
What is your problem?
- Right now?

624
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,000
You are my problem.

625
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,840
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

626
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,720
Do you want me
to put you in the hospital?

627
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,120
Jake... Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?

628
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,160
Jake, you're really hot.

629
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,960
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?

630
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,960
I don't know what's happening.

631
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,040
I got to go.

632
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,000
That dude is weird.

633
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,320
<I>Jake.

634
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,400
<I>Uh, your Dad says you have mono.

635
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,200
<I>He won't let me visit but...
would you call me?

636
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:26,800
<I>Hey, uh, it's me again.
I just...

637
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,520
<I>I'm sorry about what I said
at the movie theatre.

638
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,720
<I>I just wanted to hear your voice.
So, no pressure.

639
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,920
Jacob, please call me.

640
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,400
Okay, we should be
back around three.

641
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,040
Hey!

642
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,640
Look, I don't have to go fishing today.
- Yes, you do.

643
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,560
Yeah, you do. Go.
What are you talking about?

644
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,720
Just be careful.
- I always am.

645
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,680
Those bears won't get
the drop on me, Bella.

646
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,160
My kung foo is strong.

647
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,800
Jake!

648
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,480
You cut your hair?

649
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,600
And got a tattoo?

650
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,520
Bella...

651
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,240
I thought you were too sick
to come outside.

652
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,760
Or pick up the phone
when I'd call.

653
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:14,440
Go away.
- What?

654
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,760
Go away.

655
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,600
What happened to you?
What's wrong?

656
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,400
Hey, what happened?

657
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,880
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?

658
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,080
Sam's trying to help me,
don't blame him.

659
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,360
But if you want somebody to blame,

660
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,760
How about those
filthy bloodsuckers, you love?

661
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,800
The Cullen’s.

662
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,400
I don't know
what are you talking about.

663
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,920
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

664
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,600
You been lying to everyone.
Charlie...

665
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:59,120
But you can't lie to me.

666
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,640
Not anymore, Bella.
- Come on! Jacob!

667
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,320
Look, Bella...

668
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,440
We can't be friends anymore.

669
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,560
Jake, I know that
I have been...

670
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,080
...hurting you.

671
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,720
It's... it's killing me.
It kills me.

672
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,640
If you, may be,
give me like some time.

673
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,320
Don't!

674
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,840
It's not you.

675
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,960
It's not you, it's me, right?
Really?

676
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,360
It's true!
It is me.

677
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,600
I'm not good.

678
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,800
I used to be... a great kid.

679
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,760
Not anymore.

680
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,480
It doesn't even matter, alright?
This is over.

681
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,880
You can't break up with me.

682
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,800
I mean...

683
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,440
I mean, you're my best friend.

684
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,000
You promised me.

685
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,800
I know.

686
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,040
I promised that
I won't hurt you, Bella.

687
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,680
And this is me keeping that promise.

688
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,240
Go home.

689
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,720
And don't come back.
Or you're goanna get hurt.

690
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,400
<I>Alice...

691
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,240
<I>Things are...

692
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,840
<I>Things are bad again.

693
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,200
<I>Without Jake, I just...
I can't stand it.

694
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,880
<I>I don't see Edward anymore.

695
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,320
<I>Now it really feels like
he never existed.

696
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,080
<I>I will find a place
where I can see him again.

697
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,480
Bella.
- Laurent!

698
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,760
I didn't expect to find you here.

699
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:28,080
I went to visit the Cullen’s, but...
the house is empty.

700
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm surprised they left you behind.

701
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,320
Weren't you sort of a, um,

702
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,600
...a pet of theirs?

703
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,920
Yeah. You could say that.

704
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,880
Do they Cullen’s visit often?

705
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,040
<I>Lie.

706
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,640
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.
- Lie better.

707
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,520
I'll tell them that you stopped by.

708
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,600
I probably shouldn't tell...

709
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,400
...to Edward.

710
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,000
Because he's pretty protective.
- But he's far away, isn't he?

711
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,440
Why are you here?

712
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:20,640
I came as a favour to Victoria.

713
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,400
Victoria?

714
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,280
She asked me to see
if you were still...

715
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,560
...under the protection
of the Cullen’s.

716
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,400
Victoria feels it's only fair
to kill Edwards mate...

717
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,400
...given he killed hers.

718
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,480
An eye for an eye.

719
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,080
Threaten him.
- Edward would know who did it!

720
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,000
And he'd come after you.

721
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,880
I don't think he will.

722
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,560
After all, how much could
you mean to him...

723
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,400
...if he left you here unprotected?

724
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,040
Victoria won't be happy
about me killing you.

725
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,520
But I can't help myself.

726
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,560
You're so mouth-watering.
- Please, don't!

727
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,080
I mean, you'd helped us.
- Shhhh!

728
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,680
Don't be afraid.
I'm doing you a kindness.

729
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:15,520
Victoria plans on killing you
slowly, painfully,

730
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,320
...whereas I'll make it quick.
I promise.

731
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,280
You will feel nothing.

732
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,640
Edward, I love you.

733
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,200
I don't believe it.

734
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,200
Dad, I saw them!

735
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,160
What's the matter?
- In the woods. They are not bears!

736
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,120
What you mean in the woods?

737
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,080
Bella, what the hell were you doing
out in the woods?

738
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,800
They are wolves.
I mean, they're like huge wolves!

739
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,080
Are you sure about that, Bella?
- Yeah, I just saw them.

740
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,720
They were after... something.

741
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,600
Wolves? You saw?

742
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,520
Alright.
Well, Harry,

743
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,520
...feel like going hunting?

744
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,320
Can you get some of
your guys together?

745
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,840
Sure, yeah. I'll...
I'll just...

746
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,440
<I>I know that those wolves
will be dead.

747
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,720
<I>And Laurent would have told her
I'm unprotected.

748
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,360
<I>Victoria.

749
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,240
I should go to the station.

750
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,560
Dad, you should...
You should go.

751
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,360
You can just stay in the house?

752
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,480
Bella!

753
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,680
Oh, you scared me.

754
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,960
What the hell are you doing?
- Back up. I'm coming up.

755
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,200
Look, look, I'm sorry.

756
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,160
For what?
- I wish I could explain,

757
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:38,760
...but I literally... can't!

758
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,520
Have you ever had a secret
you couldn't tell anyone?

759
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,720
One that wasn't yours to share.

760
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,720
Well, that's what
it's like for me.

761
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,080
Or worse.

762
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:06,600
You have no idea,
how tight I'm bounded.

763
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,440
I hate this.

764
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,240
I hate what they have
done to you.

765
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,360
I mean, the killer part is
you already know!

766
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:38,040
Bella, do you remember,
when walked on the beach in La Push?

767
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,480
The stop...

768
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:49,240
The story...
The story about the cold ones.

769
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:55,080
I guess, I understand why that's
the only part you remember.

770
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,360
There must got to be something
You can do...

771
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,760
No.
I'm in it for life.

772
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,040
May be we should just
get out of here for a while.

773
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,960
We'll just leave.
Just you and me.

774
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,520
You can do that?

775
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,240
I'll do it for you.

776
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,080
It's not something
I can just run away from, Bella.

777
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,200
But I would run away with you.

778
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,960
If I could.

779
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,600
I got to go.
They'll certainly wonder where I am.

780
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,040
Come here.

781
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:04,360
Please...
Try to remember.

782
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:10,920
It would be so much easier
if you knew...

783
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,520
I tried, but...
Jake.

784
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,480
Jake, what are you doing?
Wait, Jake.

785
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,040
Jake!

786
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,360
Edward, I'm scared.

787
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,920
You should be.

788
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,760
<I>Really it's just like an old story...

789
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,640
<I>That we're not supposed to
say anything about...

790
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,320
<I>Did you know, the Quileute are
supposed to be descendants from wolves?

791
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,560
Bella.

792
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,240
I need to see him.

793
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,120
He's not in.

794
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,960
I'm sorry, really need to see him.
- Bella?

795
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,280
What did you do?

796
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:46,720
Okay, what did you do?
- Hey!

797
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:47,880
What did you do to him?
- Easy!

798
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,120
He didn't want this!
- But we do.

799
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,280
What did he do? What did he tell you?
- Both of you calm...

800
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:55,640
Nothing! He told me nothing,
because he's scared of you!

801
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,880
Too late, now.
- Bella, get back.

802
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,480
Paul, calm down now.

803
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,240
Bella!

804
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,880
Run!

805
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,240
Jake, run!

806
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,920
Take Bella back to Emily's place.

807
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,280
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

808
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,000
<I>Alice...

809
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,920
<I>Is it possible that everything is true?

810
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,040
<I>The fairy tales and
horror stories?

811
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,800
<I>Is it possible that there isn't anything
sane and normal at all?

812
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,240
Hey, I think, we should go back
and see if Jacob's okay.

813
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,080
I hope Paul gets some teeth in him.
Serve him right.

814
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,280
No way. Jake's a natural.
You see him phase on the fly?

815
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,280
I got to fiver says,
Paul doesn't touch him.

816
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,200
Come on in, Bella.
We won't bite.

817
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,240
Speak for yourself.

818
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,760
Oh, hey, about Emily...
Sam's fiancé,

819
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,440
...don't stare.
It bugs him.

820
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,800
Why would I stare?

821
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:03,720
You guys hungry?
Like I have to ask...

822
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,120
Who's this?

823
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,520
Bella Swan.
Who else?

824
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,560
So, you’re the vampire girl.

825
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,000
So, you're the wolf girl.

826
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:28,360
Guess so.

827
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:31,480
Well, I'm engaged to one.

828
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,240
Save some for your brothers.

829
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,120
And the ladies first.

830
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,400
Muffin?
- Sure. Thanks.

831
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:45,280
Leave it to Jake up to find
a way around Sam's gag order.

832
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:49,080
He didn't say anything to me.
- That's a wolf thing.

833
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,640
Alpha's orders get obeyed
whether we want to or not.

834
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,040
Alright, check it out!
We can hear each other's thoughts.

835
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,240
Will you just shut up?
These are trade secrets.

836
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,520
Damn it!
This chick runs with vampires.

837
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,560
I can't really run with vampires.

838
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,800
Because they are fast.

839
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,400
Yeah? Oh, we are faster.

840
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,120
Freaked out yet?

841
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,120
You're not the first monsters, I met.

842
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,120
Jake's right.
You are good with the weird.

843
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,840
Sorry.

844
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,160
So you're a werewolf?

845
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,680
Yeah, last time I checked.

846
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:10,760
A few lucky members of the tribe
that have the gene.

847
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:15,320
If a bloodsucker moves into town,
and the fever sets in.

848
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,920
Mono?

849
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,160
Yeah, I wish.

850
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,320
You can't find a way to stop?

851
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,400
I mean it's wrong.

852
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:38,720
It's not a life-style choice, Bella.

853
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:41,600
I was born this way,
I can't help it.

854
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:42,880
You are such a hypocrite.

855
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,000
What, I'm not the
right kind of monster for you?

856
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:49,200
It's not what you are.
It's what you do.

857
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,280
They never hurt anybody.

858
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,640
You killed people, Jake.

859
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,720
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

860
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,720
Then, who is?

861
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,600
We're trying to protect
you people from them.

862
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,480
The only thing we do kill.

863
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,360
Vampires.

864
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,080
Jake, you can't...

865
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,640
Don't worry, we can't touch your
little precious Cullen’s.

866
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:17,440
Unless they violate the Treaty.

867
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,640
It's not what I'm saying.

868
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,840
You can't kill vampires, though.

869
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,800
They will kill you.
- Really?

870
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,960
We took out that leech with
the dreads easy enough.

871
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,840
Laurent?

872
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,040
And his redhead girlfriend is next.

873
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:39,200
Vic... Victoria is here?
- Was.

874
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,600
We chased her all the way to the
Canadian border the other night.

875
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,200
But she keeps coming back.

876
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:46,680
We don't know what she's after.
- I do.

877
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,640
Me.

878
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,200
Don't worry,
we've got this place covered.

879
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,720
She won’t get near you or Charlie.

880
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,360
But you got to be careful.

881
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,640
She's fast, you don't know,
how fast she is.

882
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,200
You know, your lack of confidence
in us is a little insulting.

883
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,240
Alright, I better go.

884
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,920
And you got to go.
- Yeah.

885
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,760
I got a vampire to kill.

886
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,720
<I>Alice, I'm alright.

887
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,600
<I>Until I'm alone.

888
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,280
<I>And lately,
that's all the time.

889
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,240
<I>Jacob's gone,
he's hunting for Victoria.

890
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,560
<I>And Charlie is hunting Jacob.

891
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,240
<I>And you're gone.

892
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,760
<I>And so is Edward.

893
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:06,200
<I>And I just have nothing now.

894
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,560
You got something, Harry?

895
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:14,880
Nope, nothing.

896
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,880
<I>But I realize where I have to go,

897
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,240
<I>What I have to do
to see him again.

898
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,440
<I>Don't do this.

899
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,240
You wanted me to be human.

900
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,560
Watch me.

901
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,080
<I>Please? For me?

902
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,560
You won't stay with me
any other way.

903
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,080
<I>Bella. Please.

904
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:20,360
<I>Breathe!

905
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,600
<I>Breathe!

906
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,000
Come on, Bella.
Breathe.

907
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,640
Bella?
Bella, can you hear me?

908
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,960
Jake.

909
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:55,120
What the hell were you thinking, huh?

910
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,680
I just needed to see something.

911
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,400
Take her home.

912
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,840
I'm goanna go help over at Harry's place.

913
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,960
What happened at Harry's?

914
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,520
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

915
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,320
Charlie and my Dad are at Harry's place
with his family.

916
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:17,840
Is he okay?
- He's gone.

917
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:25,120
Come on, I'll give you something to dry
and drive you home.

918
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:38,960
Hundred and eight degrees over here.

919
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,480
God!

920
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,560
My hands are freezing.

921
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,760
It must be nice, never getting cold.

922
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:54,240
It’s a wolf thing.
- It's not.

923
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,920
It’s a Jacob thing.
You’re just warm.

924
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,560
You're like, your own sun.

925
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:11,520
This is better.
Now that you know about me.

926
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,840
But...?

927
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,040
You saw what happened to Emily.

928
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,960
Sam got angry,

929
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:31,200
...lost it for a split second...

930
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,680
...Em was standing too close.

931
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,200
He will never be able
to take that back.

932
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,000
What if I get mad at you?

933
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,240
Sometimes...

934
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:02,080
I feel like, I'm goanna disappear.

935
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,680
You need not hear it from me.

936
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:19,520
But I always will.
You're not goanna lose yourself.

937
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,400
I won't let that happen.

938
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,960
How?

939
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,800
I'll tell you all the time.

940
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,360
How special you are.

941
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:00,200
Thank you...

942
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,000
...for everything.

943
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,600
Wait!

944
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:15,280
There's a vampire.
- How do you know?

945
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,440
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out.

946
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,720
That's Carlisle's car!

947
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,400
They’re here.

948
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,240
Bella, it's a trick. Stop!

949
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,040
You got to come with me.

950
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,560
They won't hurt me.

951
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:36,880
If a Cullen is back here,
this is their territory.

952
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,120
The treaty says we can only
defend our own lands.

953
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:43,960
I can't protect you here.
- Okay, it's okay. You don't have to.

954
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,960
You’re about to cross a line.
- Then don't draw one.

955
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,360
Please.

956
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:11,080
Alice!
- You're dead!

957
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:13,040
Bella?
- What are you...?

958
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:16,680
I'm sorry, I just...
I can't believe you're here.

959
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:17,840
Is... Is...?

960
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,720
Would you like to explain to me
how you're alive?

961
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:24,760
What?
- I saw a vision of you.

962
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,840
You jumped off a cliff.

963
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,200
Why in the hell would you try
and kill yourself?

964
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:32,720
I mean, what about Charlie? What about...?
- I didn't try to kill myself.

965
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:34,840
I was cliff jumping.

966
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,360
Recreationally!

967
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,400
It was fun.

968
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:44,800
I have never met anyone more prone
to life-threatening idiocy.

969
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,800
Did you... did you tell him?
- No.

970
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:59,520
He only calls once in a few months.

971
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:03,080
He said he wants to be alone.

972
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:12,880
Aw, what is that
God awful wet dog smell?

973
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,320
That's probably me.

974
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,120
Or... it's Jacob.

975
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,440
Jacob who?

976
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:27,000
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

977
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:31,600
Ugh! Bella! Werewolf's are not
good company to keep!

978
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:34,480
Speak for yourself.

979
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,600
I had to see if you were safe.

980
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,320
I thought you couldn't protect me here.

981
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,680
Guess, I don't care.

982
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,600
Well, I'm not goanna hurt her.

983
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,120
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

984
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,760
We're talking about
the other bloodsucker...

985
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,840
...who tried to kill Bella
because of you.

986
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:03,920
Victoria?
- Yeah, Victoria has been around.

987
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:06,080
I didn't see her.

988
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,280
I didn't see you getting pulled out
of the water either.

989
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:14,080
I can't see past you
and your pack of mutts!

990
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,000
Don't get me upset.
- Hey, stop!

991
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:19,800
Things are goanna get very ugly!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

992
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,480
I will give you a minute.

993
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:39,040
You're going anywhere,
you're goanna come back, right?

994
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,040
As soon as you put the dog out.

995
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:52,240
Is he...?

996
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,440
Are there others?

997
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,000
How many Cullen’s are here
and how long are they staying?

998
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,840
No.

999
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,400
It's just Alice.

1000
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,440
And she can stay
as long as she like.

1001
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:15,440
Are the rest coming back?

1002
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,440
No.

1003
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,680
Not that I know of.

1004
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,160
Anything else?

1005
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:34,880
That's it.

1006
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,000
Well, if that's all, then you better go
run back to Sam.

1007
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:45,320
I have done it again.

1008
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:49,040
I keep breaking my promise.

1009
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:56,280
We don't have to do this to each other.

1010
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,680
Yes, we do.

1011
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,120
Bella...

1012
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,040
Stay with me forever.

1013
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,240
Swan Residence.

1014
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,880
He's not here right now.

1015
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,840
He's arranging a funeral.

1016
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:07,960
Who is that?

1017
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:11,360
What?
- Always in the way.

1018
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,360
Who was that?
- Bella, step back.

1019
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:18,160
Jacob, who was that?
- Stop.

1020
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,040
Bella, it's Edward.

1021
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,520
He thinks you are dead.

1022
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:24,240
Rosalie told him,
why I came here.

1023
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,000
Why would you...?

1024
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:28,800
Why didn't you let me speak to him?

1025
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,800
He didn't ask for you.
- I don't care!

1026
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,640
Bella, he's going to the Volturi.

1027
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,240
He wants to die too.

1028
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,240
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore, remember?

1029
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,560
But I'm not goanna let him
kill himself out of guilt.

1030
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,160
What about your Dad?

1031
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:48,960
I'm eighteen,

1032
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,280
I'm legally free to go.
And I left a note.

1033
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,760
Please, Bella.

1034
01:32:56,240 --> 01:32:58,840
Just... stay here.

1035
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,040
Not for Charlie.

1036
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:06,240
For me...

1037
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,720
I got to go.

1038
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,200
I'm begging you.

1039
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,640
Please.

1040
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,920
Bye, Jacob.

1041
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,600
Okay.

1042
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:36,840
So you made up your mind?

1043
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:40,160
I'm afraid your particular gifts...

1044
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:43,640
...are too valuable
to destroy.

1045
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,400
But if you're unhappy
with your lot,

1046
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,760
...join us.

1047
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:54,120
We would be delighted
to utilize your skills.

1048
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:57,360
Won't you consider
staying with us?

1049
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:01,160
You know what will happen anyway.

1050
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:04,160
Not without cause.

1051
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,520
Such a waste.

1052
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,920
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?

1053
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,280
I figured, you wouldn't be
opposed to grand theft auto.

1054
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:21,880
Not today.

1055
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,200
What? What are you seeing?
- They refused him.

1056
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,160
So...?
- He's goanna make a scene.

1057
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:34,320
Show himself to the humans.
- No! When?

1058
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:38,080
He's goanna wait until noon,
when the sun's at its highest.

1059
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:44,040
Alice, you got to hurry up.
- There's Volterra.

1060
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,680
Why are they all in red?
- San Marcos Day festival.

1061
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:14,720
They're commemorating the expulsion
of the vampires from the city.

1062
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,120
It's the perfect setting.

1063
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:18,720
The Volturi will never let him
get far enough to reveal himself.

1064
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:23,160
We have 5 minutes.
- You know, Bella? Breathe.

1065
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,040
Alice?!

1066
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,320
Bella, you're the only one
he can't see coming.

1067
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,560
If I go, he will read my thoughts...

1068
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,520
...he'll think I'm lying
and rush into it.

1069
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:38,200
Where do I go?
- He'll be under the clock tower.

1070
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:39,480
Go!

1071
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,520
No!

1072
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,320
Heaven.

1073
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,280
You have to move!

1074
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,920
Open your eyes, look at me.
I'm alive.

1075
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,280
You have to move!

1076
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,520
Bella?

1077
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,440
You're here.
- Yeah.

1078
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:01,360
You're alive!

1079
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,920
Yes.

1080
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:17,320
I needed you to see me once.

1081
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:22,560
You had to know that I was alive.
You didn't have to feel guilty or anything.

1082
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:29,880
I can let you go now.

1083
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,720
You never had to let it go.

1084
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:41,120
I just couldn't live in a world
where you don't exist.

1085
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,400
But you said...
- I lied.

1086
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:49,240
I had to lie
and you believe me so easily.

1087
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:58,240
Because it doesn't make sense
for you to love me.

1088
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:04,520
I'm nothing... human.
Nothing.

1089
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:09,720
Bella, you're everything to me.

1090
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,880
Everything.

1091
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:40,480
I won't be needing your services
after all, gentlemen.

1092
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:42,440
Aro wants to speak with you again.

1093
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:43,800
No rules were broken.

1094
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,960
Nevertheless, we should take this
conversation...

1095
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,040
...to a more appropriate venue.

1096
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:49,920
Fine.

1097
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,280
Bella, why don't you go enjoy
the rest of the festival?

1098
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,600
The girl comes with us.
- No. You can go to hell.

1099
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:01,920
Come on, guys.
It's a festival.

1100
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,320
We wouldn't want to make a scene.

1101
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,040
We wouldn’t.

1102
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,240
Enough!

1103
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:10,840
Jane.

1104
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,840
Aro send me to see
what's taking so long.

1105
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:24,480
Just do as she says.

1106
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,520
Go ahead.

1107
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,960
Are you scared?

1108
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:46,360
Are you?

1109
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,440
No.

1110
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:22,360
Good afternoon.

1111
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,240
Is she human?
- Yes.

1112
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:35,400
Does she know?
- Yes.

1113
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,440
Then why would...

1114
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,120
She wants to be...

1115
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,520
And so she will be.
- Or dessert!

1116
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:57,000
Sister, sent you out to get one
and you bring back two.

1117
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,120
And a half.

1118
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:01,360
Such a clever girl.

1119
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,040
What a happy surprise!

1120
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:07,640
Bella is alive after all.

1121
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:11,360
Isn't that wonderful?

1122
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:14,080
I love a happy ending.

1123
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:20,240
They are so rare.

1124
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,560
"La Tua Cantante. "
'Your Singer'

1125
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,440
Your blood appeals to you
so much...

1126
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,240
...it makes me thirsty.

1127
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:35,400
How can you stand
to be so close to her?

1128
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:38,680
It's not without difficulty.
- Yes, I can see that.

1129
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,360
Aro can read every thought
I ever had.

1130
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:46,040
With one touch.

1131
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,600
And now you know everything.

1132
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,080
So, get on with it.

1133
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:58,320
You're quite soul reader yourself, Edward.

1134
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,680
Though...

1135
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:03,640
...you can't read Bella's thoughts.

1136
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,880
Fascinating!

1137
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,920
I would love to see if...

1138
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:17,800
...you are an exception
to my gifts, as well.

1139
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,960
Would you do me the honour?

1140
01:44:43,080 --> 01:44:44,720
Interesting.

1141
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:48,560
I see nothing.

1142
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,520
I wonder if...

1143
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:03,480
Let's see if she is immune
to all our powers.

1144
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,240
Shall we, Jane?

1145
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,240
No!
- Pain.

1146
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:27,240
Stop!

1147
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:29,760
Stop, please!
Stop!

1148
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:31,560
Stop!

1149
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,760
Just stop hurting him, please!
Please!

1150
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:36,520
Jane?

1151
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:40,040
Master?

1152
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:45,840
Go ahead, my dear.

1153
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:53,080
This may hurt just a little.

1154
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:11,560
Remarkable!

1155
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:16,040
She confounds us all.

1156
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:20,080
So, what we do with you now?

1157
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:23,760
You already know
what you're going to do, Aro.

1158
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:28,640
She knows too much,
she's a liability.

1159
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:34,160
That's true.

1160
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,760
Felix?

1161
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:49,120
Please! No, no!
Please!

1162
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,600
Kill me... kill me.

1163
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,440
Not him.

1164
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:08,880
How extraordinary.

1165
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,720
You would give up your life...

1166
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:15,120
...for someone like us.

1167
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,200
A vampire.

1168
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,800
A soulless monster.

1169
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,800
Just get away from him!

1170
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,440
You don't know a thing...

1171
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:32,440
...about his soul.

1172
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:40,160
Maybe it's one or the other.

1173
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:45,040
This is a sadness.

1174
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:51,040
If only it be your intention
to give her immortality.

1175
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,800
Wait!

1176
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,080
Bella will be one of us.

1177
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,440
I've seen it.

1178
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:11,200
I'll change her myself.

1179
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,640
Mesmerizing!

1180
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,120
To see, what you have seen.

1181
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,320
Before it is happened.

1182
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,160
Your gifts...

1183
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:59,600
...will make for an intriguing...

1184
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:02,000
...immortal.

1185
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,440
Isabella.

1186
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,560
Go now.

1187
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,040
Make your preparations.

1188
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:16,400
Let's be done with this.

1189
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:20,480
Heidi will arrive, any moment.

1190
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,680
Thank you...

1191
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:26,800
...for the visit.
- We'll return the favour.

1192
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,080
I would advise...

1193
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:32,240
...that you follow through on your promise soon.
We do not offer second chances.

1194
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,200
Goodbye...

1195
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,360
...my young friends.

1196
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,040
<I>Nice fishing, Heidi.

1197
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,440
<I>Yes, they do look rather juicy.

1198
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,520
<I>Save some for me.

1199
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,760
<I>This way, please.
Stay together.

1200
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:21,680
You're here.

1201
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,400
You can sleep.

1202
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:31,480
I'll still be here
when you wake up.

1203
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:39,200
Bella, the only reason
that I left...

1204
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:42,880
...was because I thought
I was protecting you.

1205
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:47,680
I needed you to have a chance...

1206
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:51,400
...at a normal, happy life.

1207
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,320
It was so easy for you to leave.

1208
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:03,680
Leaving you was the hardest thing
I've done in a 100 years.

1209
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:12,160
I swear...

1210
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:16,480
I will never fail you again.

1211
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,840
I'm so sorry.

1212
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,760
Charlie's coming.
- Hey!

1213
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:28,560
You okay?

1214
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:31,400
Fine.

1215
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,280
Dad, you don't have to worry.

1216
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,840
Yeah, last time you said that
you took off.

1217
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:41,120
I didn't see you for three days.

1218
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:45,160
I'm really sorry, Dad.

1219
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:50,760
Bella, do not ever do that
to me again.

1220
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,480
Ever.

1221
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,600
And you're grounded...

1222
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,400
...for the rest of your life.

1223
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,600
Okay.

1224
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:16,440
I'm not technically breaking
any of his rules.

1225
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:22,440
He did say, I couldn't take a step
inside through the door.

1226
01:53:23,080 --> 01:53:25,000
I came in through the window.

1227
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:31,480
He's not going to forgive me easily.

1228
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,520
I know.

1229
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:38,960
Can you?

1230
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:44,480
I hope you can because...

1231
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:48,080
I honestly don't know
how to live without you.

1232
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,920
Come here.

1233
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:15,520
Once Alice changes me,

1234
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:19,440
...you can't get rid of me.

1235
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:22,880
She won't need to change you.

1236
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,640
There are always ways to keep
the Volturi in the dark.

1237
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,360
No.

1238
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,080
No!

1239
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:40,280
You all know what I want.

1240
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:46,160
And I know,
how much I'm asking for.

1241
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:49,080
The only thing I can think of...
for...

1242
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,920
...it to be fair is to just vote.

1243
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:54,360
You don't know what you just...
- Just... shut up!

1244
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:57,240
Alice?

1245
01:54:57,560 --> 01:55:00,000
I already consider you my sister.

1246
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,720
Yes!
- Thank you.

1247
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:07,280
I vote, yes.

1248
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:11,920
It would be nice to not want to
kill you all the time.

1249
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:16,800
I'm sorry.

1250
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,840
I'm really sorry, both of you,
for the way I've acted.

1251
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:23,280
And I'm really grateful...

1252
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:26,080
...that you were brave enough
to go and save my brother.

1253
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:31,440
But this isn't a life
I would have chosen for myself.

1254
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:37,040
And I wish that there had been
someone to vote no for me.

1255
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,320
So... no.

1256
01:55:43,240 --> 01:55:45,160
I vote hell yeah!

1257
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:49,440
We can pick a fight with
these Vulture’s some other way.

1258
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:52,040
I already consider you,
a part of the family.

1259
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:54,680
Yes!

1260
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:02,200
Why are you doing this to me?

1261
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:07,400
You know what this means.
- You've chosen not to live without her,

1262
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,440
...which leaves me no choice.

1263
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,000
I won't lose my son.

1264
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:20,680
<I>I'll wait until after graduation...

1265
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:23,080
<I>...to make it easier on Charlie.

1266
01:56:27,320 --> 01:56:30,000
I want you to be the one
to do it.

1267
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:39,040
He wants to talk to me.

1268
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,640
See, you're still alive for now.

1269
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:46,040
He thinks, it's me keeping you away.

1270
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:48,600
You stay the hell out of my head.

1271
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:51,320
Jacob...

1272
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,240
...I know you have
something to say to me.

1273
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:58,680
But I want to say something to you first.
If that's alright?

1274
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,400
Thank you.

1275
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:07,960
Thank you for keeping
Bella alive when...

1276
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:09,120
...I didn’t.

1277
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:12,080
No, you didn't.

1278
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:15,880
And it wasn't for your benefit,
trust me.

1279
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:17,840
I'm still grateful.

1280
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:19,640
But I'm here now.

1281
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:22,520
And I'm not goanna leave her side
till she orders me away.

1282
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:24,200
We'll see.

1283
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,720
Hey, my turn to talk.

1284
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:36,360
I'm here to remind you about
a key point in the Treaty.

1285
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:38,960
I haven't forgotten.

1286
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:40,600
What key point?

1287
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:46,040
If any of them bites a human,
the truce is over.

1288
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:49,120
But if I choose it,
it has nothing to do with you.

1289
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:51,920
No... No, I won't let you.

1290
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:55,040
You're not goanna be
one of them, Bella.

1291
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:57,120
It's not up to you.

1292
01:57:57,840 --> 01:57:59,360
You know what we'll do to you.

1293
01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:01,880
I won't have choice.
- Bella, please come.

1294
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:03,480
Wait.

1295
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,320
Is he goanna hurt me?
Read his mind.

1296
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:17,040
Jake...

1297
01:58:23,200 --> 01:58:25,200
I love you.

1298
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:31,440
So, please...

1299
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:37,640
Don’t make me choose.

1300
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:45,240
Because it'll be him.

1301
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:50,800
It's always been him.

1302
01:58:58,040 --> 01:58:59,960
Bella...

1303
01:59:07,120 --> 01:59:09,960
Goodbye, Jacob.
- No, you don't speak for her!

1304
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,520
Bella, get out of here.

1305
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,040
Stop!

1306
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:23,480
Stop!

1307
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:26,480
You can't hurt each other
without hurting me.

1308
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,440
Jake?

1309
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:03,560
He's right.

1310
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:06,320
You shouldn't become one of us.

1311
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:13,520
I can't do this alone.

1312
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:18,480
Then please just wait.

1313
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:28,840
Just give me... five years.

1314
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:35,560
It's too long.

1315
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:41,840
Then, three?

1316
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,880
You're so stubborn.

1317
02:00:49,640 --> 02:00:51,560
What are you waiting for?

1318
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:04,400
I have one condition...

1319
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:08,640
...if you want me
to do it myself.

1320
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:14,320
What's the condition?

1321
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:16,760
And then, forever.

1322
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:20,560
That's what I'm asking.

1323
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:34,080
Marry me, Bella.
