No, Mrs. Bartlett, it's not his grades
and it's not his attendance.

17

Look, quite frankly, he is one of
our brightest boys here at school,

You're expelling him

Look, Mrs. Bartlett, to be honest,
I think he has a lot of potential.

He's innovative, he's intelligent.
He's obviously highly motivated.

Perhaps this would be
a good time for an endowment.

28
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,465
No. Mrs. Bartlett, what he did was illegal

29

I just can't fathom why you did it.
It's not like you needed the money.

35
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:23,430
I mean, really, Charlie, what would
your father say if he were here?

My daddy was driving me back
from summer camp

"Daddy, I think I'm sloughing."

blood was gushing
from my you-know-where.

I'm not an MD, but it is possible
for Ritalin to get you pretty high.

That's probably what it is.

so he can plow roads
with a sense of humor.

Maybe the cheerleaders call you
a scumbag behind your back.

370

Maybe it's because the school's
got you placed on the remedial track

and your teachers are really good
at making you feel like an idiot.

- I wanna be your friend, Murphy.

can't be friends.

that we could sell at the dance.

Maybe we're just gonna have to
settle for being business partners.

381
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,277
What do these do?

382
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,551
Floods the brain
with norepinephrine and dopamine.

383

It gets you high.

So, I figure $10 a pill, right?

385
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:38,887
We split the profit,

386

which means you make almost 500 bucks
without spending a nickel.

it's probably mental.

I'll put you on a low dose of

471
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,794
Xanax and Zoloft.

472
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,294
Okay, so, here's the thing.
In everything that I've read,

473
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:58,274
there's not one case of anyone dying
of a panic attack.

474
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,744
- No?
- No. Not one.

475
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,647
So the next time you start to feel anxious,
you just tell yourself,

476
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:09,949
"Hey, I'm having a panic attack.
I'm not gonna die.

477
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:13,752
"In fact, in 15 minutes,
I'll probably feel fine."

478
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,256
What do I do until then?

479
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,162
CHARLIE: Murph, start him on
50 milligrams of Zoloft

480
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,292
and half a milligram of Xanax as needed.

481
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:29,235
Here, Kip, this should provide you
with some relief

482
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,707

- No problem. Be nice, Murphy.

485
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,796
Charlie, I spoke to Dr. Weathers today.

486
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,663
He said you may have not only ADD,

487
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,769
but a whole battery
of psychological disorders

488
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,500
that will likely plague you for life.

490

Sounds a bit melodramatic,
don't you think?

491
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,637
That's what I said.

492
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,809
Then he went on to imply that
you may have inherited it from me.

493
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,483
I was rather perturbed.

494
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,886
I mean, look at me.
I'm as fit as a fucking fiddle.

495
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,325
Can't argue with that.

496
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,962
Are you making any friends at all?

497
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,022
Working on it.

498
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,637
He says he doesn't want to see me.

499
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,764
I can't stop crying.

500
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:41,505
Well, sometimes people say one thing
and they really mean another, like...

501
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,844
He called me a loser,
and last night he hit my mom.

502
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:49,243
You have to understand that
what he's doing isn't because of you.

503
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,379
He hates his life so much that...

504
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:55,222
All I wanna do is drop acid.
I just can't handle this place.

505
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,622
Duh, dude. This place sucks.

506
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,328
But I just worry that one day
we're gonna look back at high school

507
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,526
and wish we'd done something different.

508
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,659
So maybe you should...

509
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:05,827
Get breast implants.

510
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,837
I mean, a lot of my friends
are getting them.

511
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,305
Well, that's up to you,
but speaking as a guy,

512
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,002
it's kind of a turnoff when a girl
isn't cool with being herself.

513
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,411
I'm not saying that I'm gay.

514
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:19,144
So what if, you know,
I'm not attracted to girls?

515
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,778
You know, this sucks, man.

516

to somebody.

then we'd really be up shit's creek.

518
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,926
I feel very productive,
and I can't sleep at all.

519
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:34,829

and I'm given to frivolous spending

522

523
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,796
like Prozac.

524
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:44,967
What else can you tell me about...

525
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:49,536
Feelings of depersonalization
and boredom.

526
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,838
Anger and aggression. Irritability.

527

Obsessive behavior is I guess
what you guys call it.

528

Like, whenever I hear anyone say a word
that starts with the letter...

Do I get to meet your dad, too?

No, he's actually not with us anymore.

Yeah. It's okay.

647
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,896
He was a CIA agent, you know. Yeah.

648
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,924
He survived Somalia, Yugoslavia, Iraq.

649
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,562
Finally, he came home, you know,

650
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:58,233
and our favorite thing to do together
was to get ice cream.

651
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,639
So, one day, I was just sitting around

652
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:04,442
and I heard the ice cream truck outside

653
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,245
and it always played the same song,

<i>Yankee Doodle.</i>

655
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,215
So, basically, he ran out
to stop the truck and it just

656
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,282
drove right over him
and killed him instantly.

So, what did my dad want?

753
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,961
He just wanted to welcome me back.

754
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,406
He didn't say anything about me
hanging out with you?

755
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:07,708
Not really.

756
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:12,446
Maybe the way to do this
is to ask a question.

757
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,907
What question?

758
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:18,445
Charlie, I don't know.
You're the professional.

759
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:23,759
All right. Well, I guess the obvious one is
how do you feel about your dad?

760
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:27,763
You mean, besides the fact that this
stupid job turned him into an alcoholic?

761
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:28,923
Okay.

762
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,393
How do you feel about that?

763
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:36,432
I think it actually bothers him
more than me, to be honest.

764
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,633
But there was the night.

765
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,405
What's "the night"?

766
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,580
The night he found out
my mother was having an affair.

767
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:51,246
He was plastered, waving this.38 revolver
around, threatening to kill himself.

Wow.

769
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:01,025
So, your mom left and you stayed, right?

770
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,394
Yeah, pretty much.

771
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,766
Well, he promised to get rid of the gun,

772
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,239
and then he went into treatment
for a while.

773
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:15,870
And then, for whatever reason,
he decided he was into boats.

774
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,675
You know, it's like someone said,

I guess what I'm trying to say is it just...

782

It kind of sucks having one parent ditch
and then the other one lose their mind.

Have you mentioned this to your dad?

No way. Quitting football isn't gonna
go over very well,

So, what should I do?

Fuck you, dude. In fifth grade,

I played Linus in

If I'm jealous, if,

834
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,881
it's because only guys

doing things that might get you in trouble.

Well, I'm not gonna deny that, but no.

I pretty much liked you
from the first moment that I saw you.

Mmm-hmm.

the next question?

he took me out for ice cream

and he told me I had to take care of her.
