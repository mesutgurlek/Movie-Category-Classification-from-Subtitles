A note from Tornberry:
The subtitles (both streams) were timed and made
for the ENGLISH audio track, NOT the Japanese audio track.
This is why they appear early, late, and when no one's talking.
My suggestion is to watch this movie dubbed. Great voice-actors!
Thank you, Disney!

00:14:57,732 --> 00:15:00,030
Thanks, Haru. You're a lifesaver.

164
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:12,177
Come on, Tsuge. Go!

165
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:15,111
Yeah!

166
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:17,514
Yes! He's so cool!

167
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:45,112
Careful. Watch your step.

168
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:46,578
Thanks.

169
00:15:47,349 --> 00:15:49,442
Ah... Hurt...

170
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:53,212
Oh, look at the mess I made.

171
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:56,651
Oh, I missed.

172
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:11,472
Who do I think I'm fooling anyway?

173
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,632
There she is. Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

174
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,282
Oh...

175
00:16:24,352 --> 00:16:27,219
You cats just never let up!

176
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:29,756
Well, we're so glad that you're pleased.

177
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:30,984
No, I'm not.

178
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:35,052
How can that be? The whole kingdom
is working to make you happy.

179
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:38,098
And we all agreed
that the gifts were fabulous.

180
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:41,101
Don't you cats know anything?
I hate mice.

181
00:16:41,236 --> 00:16:44,694
I'm allergic to cat tails
and catnip does nothing for me.

182
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:47,172
Oh, my my my my my.

183
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:49,676
I guess we made a little mistake.

184
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,144
Well, this is embarrassing.

185
00:16:52,213 --> 00:16:55,341
The king will not be happy
when he hears about this.

186
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:57,908
I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings?

187
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,647
I overreacted, didn't I?

188
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:06,022
[Sighs] I've just been on edge recently.
Things have not been going well for me.

189
00:17:06,094 --> 00:17:10,622
- What kind of things?
- I don't know. Everything, you name it.

190
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,393
I'm shocked to hear this.

191
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,062
But I suppose even pretty girls like you
have problems like everyone else.

192
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:21,939
- What? Stop. That's enough.
- It is nowhere near enough.

193
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,640
The Kingdom of Cats has vowed not to
rest until you are completely satisfied.

194
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:29,945
- There's more?
- Yes.

195
00:17:30,018 --> 00:17:34,614
How would you like to have a private
tour of the spectacular Kingdom of Cats?

196
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,417
Are you serious?

197
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:39,652
I'm sure you'll love it there.
It's a marvelous place.

198
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:41,752
Great food, fabulous scenery

199
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:46,960
and the entire cat kingdom
is ready to welcome you.

200
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:50,937
And that's not all.
The king is so taken with you,

201
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:54,771
he has awarded you the most
valuable gift in the cat kingdom.

202
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:58,972
You will become his daughter-in-law
and marry Prince Lune.

203
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,843
Huh?

204
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,816
Don't think
about trying to pull that one on me.

205
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,352
There is no way I can marry a cat.

206
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:09,685
The royal family
thinks you're good enough

207
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,555
and the prince is so cool.

208
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:15,919
- He's cool?
- Hm-mm.

209
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:26,631
Hmm...

210
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:30,872
Who knows? Maybe I'd fit in better
with a bunch of cats.

211
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:34,437
You get to lie around all day,
don't you?

212
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:38,747
- But of course.
- Eat all the food you want,

213
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,348
take naps in the sun,
forget about all your problems.

214
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:47,485
But me getting married to a cat prince,
that's just ridiculous.

215
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:49,529
Right, cat?

216
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:52,361
Fantastic.
We'll collect you tonight, then.

217
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:56,160
No, I didn't agree to that.
Hey, wait!

218
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,532
[Haru] Ow!

219
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:02,701
Oh, I hurt.

220
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,471
Okay, think, Haru.

221
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,173
You gotta do something about this.

222
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:11,249
What can I do?
Those cats are relentless.

223
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:15,312
They'll find a way to kidnap me
and I'll have to marry a cat.

224
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,257
I now pronounce you cat and wife.

225
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:20,452
You may kiss the bride.

226
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:23,188
No, no, I don't want to marry a cat!

227
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:25,357
[Cries]

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,059
<i>[Female voice] Haru. Haru.</i>

229
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:30,903
What was that?

230
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:34,668
<i>Haru, go to the Cat Bureau.</i>
<i>Find the Cat Bureau.</i>

231
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:40,804
Hey, come on. Who's there?
Who's messing with me now?

232
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:44,943
<i>They will help you there. Look for</i>
<i>a large, white cat at the crossroads.</i>

233
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,016
<i>He will show you the way.</i>

234
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,182
A cat at a crossroad?

235
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,886
<i>Find the white cat</i>
<i>and go to the Cat Bureau, Haru.</i>

236
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,121
<i>You'll need their help.</i>

237
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:14,715
[Haru] Find the Cat Bureau.

238
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,749
Never heard of a Cat Bureau.

239
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:22,889
Look for a large, white cat...

240
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,955
At least it was a pleasant voice.
Maybe the white cat will be nice, too.

241
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:34,430
That was one long, weird day.
I definitely need a break.

242
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:36,435
- [Groans]
- [Screams]

243
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:39,597
What in the heck was that?

244
00:20:40,942 --> 00:20:44,878
Hey, you big fatso.
You cats keep freaking me out.

245
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,378
Are you the big, white cat? Are you?

246
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:53,278
Listen, cat.
I need to know where the Cat Bureau is.

247
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,291
A voice told me to ask you.

248
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:08,025
Must have the wrong person.
I mean cat. I have the wrong cat.

249
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,036
Sorry I sat on you.

250
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:14,300
- Wait. I'll show you.
- It's him!

251
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:19,105
Wait a minute. Slow down.

252
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:45,729
Isn't there an easier way?

253
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,368
Hey. Hey, come on.

254
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:52,412
Guess I shouldn't have called him Fatso.

255
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:06,684
[Sighs]

256
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:44,923
Huh?

257
00:22:57,311 --> 00:22:59,404
Oh...

258
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:16,221
Wow, this is one weird place.

259
00:23:42,023 --> 00:23:44,218
Excuse me, where's the Cat Bureau?

260
00:23:47,628 --> 00:23:50,961
Hello?
I need some help right now.

261
00:23:51,032 --> 00:23:53,967
I'm gonna get dragged off
to the cat kingdom.

262
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,403
[Gasps]

263
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:12,081
Could this be it?

264
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:34,199
Enough, Baron. Turn it off.

265
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:37,334
No one's impressed
with your cheesy light show, okay?

266
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,438
Good evening. Welcome to the Bureau

267
00:25:08,843 --> 00:25:10,936
Wow, you're cool.

268
00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:15,142
Thank you. You're now in a world
quite different from your own.

269
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:17,444
This is a refuge for creations.

270
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:21,147
Whenever someone creates something
with all of their heart,

271
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:24,089
then that creation is given a soul.

272
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:26,592
Like me and Toto there.

273
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,634
That's... That's...

274
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:42,801
That is Toto.
A stone statue with a soul.

275
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:46,176
I see you have a visitor today, Baron.
How unusual.

276
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:48,943
Indeed. She's quite a fetching one, too.

277
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,416
Did he say Baron?

278
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:53,953
I am Baron Humbert von Gikkingen.

279
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:57,057
The artisan who created me
gave me that title.

280
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:59,058
I'll just call you Baron.

281
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,598
So, you say you're having trouble
with those cats from the cat kingdom.

282
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:08,533
Yes. Yesterday I saved their prince
from getting hit by a truck,

283
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:11,401
and now they won't stop
trying to repay me.

284
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:13,234
- I see.
- Huh!

285
00:26:13,307 --> 00:26:17,607
Serves you right. Thought you'd help
the poor kitty, did you?

286
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:22,712
You should've minded your own business.

287
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:24,944
[Toto] Muta, what's your problem?

288
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:28,783
This girl saved one of your own kind.
You should be grateful.

289
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:32,086
Now she's in trouble for it, isn't she?

290
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,287
So she was stupid,
that's all I'm saying.

291
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:38,788
Where did you find her, Muta?

292
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:42,562
At the crossroads.
She knew about the Cat Bureau.

293
00:26:42,637 --> 00:26:44,298
Hmm.

294
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:48,933
A voice told me about it. I don't know
whose voice it was, though.

295
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:51,068
- A voice?
- You're hearing voices?

296
00:26:51,178 --> 00:26:54,341
Check into a loony bin.
Don't bother us with...

297
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:58,583
- Knock it off!
- You knock it off. Quit being so catty.

298
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:00,210
Don't try that again.

299
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,814
You guys, I'll just leave.
I don't want to cause any trouble.

300
00:27:03,924 --> 00:27:05,755
I didn't get your name.

301
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,488
Haru. It's Haru.

302
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:11,190
Well, Miss Haru,
please step into the Bureau.

303
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,961
- Come along. Don't worry about them.
- Chicken wings!

304
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:19,495
Can't you tell the difference
between chickens and crows?

305
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:24,374
- Yes, I'm not the birdbrain here.
- I don't look like a giant marshmallow.

306
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:27,948
- At least I don't have a bird brain.
- You already said that.

307
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:33,146
- Go fry yourself, you big chicken.
- You already called me a chicken!

308
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:39,284
This looks close.

309
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:44,060
Wow, this place is beautiful.

310
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:47,259
- Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

311
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,837
Milk with your tea, or lemon?

312
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:53,031
- Milk, please.
- Good choice.

313
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:03,844
You have great taste, Baron.

314
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:06,181
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

315
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,721
How cute.

316
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:13,589
That's my own personal blend of tea.

317
00:28:13,661 --> 00:28:17,927
It's a little different each time,
so I can't guarantee the taste.

318
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,901
Wow, that's the best tea
I've ever tasted.

319
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:23,526
Then you're lucky.

320
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:26,834
Just tastes like boiled grass to me.

321
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,005
Tea is too refined
for your crude taste buds.

322
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,978
At least I don't eat worms.

323
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:38,713
Muta, have a seat and tell us
what you know about the Kingdom of Cats.

324
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,878
It's a dangerous place.

325
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:44,480
You shouldn't go there
if you don't believe in yourself.

326
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:45,991
Good point.

327
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,324
They said not only will they kidnap me,

328
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,990
they're going to force me
to marry Prince Lune.

329
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:54,398
So, do it. You'll be set for life.

330
00:28:54,502 --> 00:28:57,369
- Are you crazy?
- It might not be all that bad.

331
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:58,995
That's ridiculous.

332
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:03,032
- She won't know until she tries it.
- Now, then...

333
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:08,445
I've always entertained the idea of
paying a visit to the Kingdom of Cats.

334
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:11,518
- Now is the time.
- Have a nice trip.

335
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:14,986
- Hope you make it back some day.
- You're coming with me.

336
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:18,115
Nah, I'll pass.
But thanks for thinking of me.

337
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,160
Baron, you're not going to
take her there, are you?

338
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:23,253
We can't leave her unprotected.

339
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:27,664
But if Muta wants to stay here,
he can keep an eye on her.

340
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:31,671
No way. You can't leave her here.
I'm not baby-sitting.

341
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:34,708
- Why? Are you busy at the moment?
- Not really.

342
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,276
I'll just go home.

343
00:29:36,377 --> 00:29:38,868
- Hmm?
- What?

344
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:42,540
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
cause you so much trouble.

345
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:47,246
Muta's right. It's my fault
for getting involved with those cats.

346
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:49,721
I'll figure something out.

347
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:55,085
Well, then, so sorry the Cat Bureau
couldn't be of any help to you.

348
00:29:56,931 --> 00:30:00,094
Ah... All right, all right.

349
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:03,635
I'll watch the little baby.

350
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:05,602
Good kitty.

351
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:08,766
Then it's settled.
You can stay here with Muta.

352
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:10,037
You sure?

353
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,945
Don't worry about Muta. He complains
a lot but he has a heart of gold.

354
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:16,038
Hmph!

355
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:19,279
Hm... I see.

356
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:21,446
So he's just a big softie.

357
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,284
You could say that.

358
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:25,416
And this is the thanks I get.

359
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:29,019
Thank you for your help, Moo-ta.
[Gasps]

360
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:32,792
What? Moo?
Are you saying that I'm a fat cow?

361
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,631
- No, you're just fat.
- I like this girl better every minute.

362
00:30:36,737 --> 00:30:38,136
I'm outta here.

363
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:42,471
That's too bad. I was just going to
get out some angel fruit cake.

364
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:45,909
- Where is it?
- It's in the upper-right shelf.

365
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,777
Why didn't you say so?

366
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:50,681
Our guest
deserves a proper afternoon tea.

367
00:30:51,785 --> 00:30:54,379
This calls
for some of my special mulberries.

368
00:30:57,892 --> 00:31:00,884
You're too much, Baron.
A tea party and everything?

369
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:05,624
- Anything I can do to help?
- Yes, there is something.

370
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:10,093
I need you to learn just one thing.
Always believe in yourself.

371
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:14,573
Do this, and no matter where you are,
you will have nothing to fear.

372
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:19,110
Baron, give me a hand
with this whipped cream.

373
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,876
- You're going all out.
- Better believe it.

374
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,547
Who knows?
Maybe this is the world I belong in.

375
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,145
[Knock at door]

376
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:31,316
Hey, is that Toto?

377
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:39,528
It's time to go to our kingdom,
Miss Haru.

378
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:44,434
You again!
No! Hey! Get away from me!

379
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:50,401
Skip the tea.

380
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:52,578
[Screams]

381
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,171
Don't let them take me away, please!

382
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:59,014
Baron,
a bunch of cats are headed this way.

383
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,019
- Oh no.
- A little late, birdbrain.

384
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:03,852
Toto, give me a lift.

385
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:09,456
Ouch!

386
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,121
We had a hard time finding you.

387
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,326
- Let me off.
- What?

388
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:16,869
- [Shrieks]
- Careful, Miss Haru.

389
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:19,804
Stop these cats.
I want off this thing now.

390
00:32:19,907 --> 00:32:24,207
Don't worry. You're just having
pre-wedding jitters, that's all.

391
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:25,642
No, I'm not!

392
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:32,577
She could've waited
until after we had cake.

393
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:34,449
Ow! Quit that!

394
00:32:34,922 --> 00:32:37,117
Let me go. Stop it. It hurts.

395
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:39,416
They're coming for me.

396
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:43,190
- I said let me go.
- Okay, Toto. Now!

397
00:32:43,263 --> 00:32:45,163
Wait. I take it back!

398
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:51,103
Why did you let him fall?
You cats are terrible.

399
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:53,230
You're gonna regret that.

400
00:32:54,074 --> 00:32:55,302
Muta!

401
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:57,604
We're over the weight limit.

402
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:02,607
- Toto.
- I see it.

403
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:19,358
[Haru screams]

404
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,132
Let me off this thing!

405
00:33:28,742 --> 00:33:30,266
Outmaneuvered.

406
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:35,040
- Get above the trees.
- Right.

407
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:47,252
Now what?

408
00:33:51,932 --> 00:33:54,628
They're riding the wind.
Follow the lights.

409
00:33:54,735 --> 00:33:56,100
Got it.

410
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,273
[Haru groans]

411
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:11,342
Oh, that hurt.

412
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:14,945
Where am I anyway?
I can't see a thing.

413
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,626
[Gasps]

414
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:26,565
Muta. What happened? You're enormous.

415
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:29,500
No, kiddo. You got smaller.

416
00:34:29,603 --> 00:34:30,627
Hm?

417
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,702
Why's that?

418
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:35,866
Because we're here, that's why.

419
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,418
That's the Kingdom of Cats?

420
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:08,831
That's it.

421
00:35:27,594 --> 00:35:29,653
[Both meow]

422
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:34,963
Wow, there are cats all over the place.

423
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:38,435
What did you expect?
It is their kingdom.

424
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:40,598
Hey, you!

425
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:50,914
Ah, it's so relaxing here.

426
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:53,987
Hey, we have to find
a way out of there fast.

427
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:56,282
- Relax.
- Listen, kid...

428
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:59,348
I've never felt so at home in my life.

429
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:02,827
[Female] Hurry.
You've got to get out of here.

430
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:07,996
You must leave.
You don't belong here.

431
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:10,195
Wow! You're beautiful.

432
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:12,704
Everything's better here.
Even the cats.

433
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:17,402
Quickly. You don't have much time.
Please, Miss Haru, before it's too late.

434
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:20,469
Wait a minute.
How do you know my name?

435
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:22,674
Miss Haru! Miss Haru!

- Huh?
- Oh, not him again.

437
00:36:26,653 --> 00:36:29,383
There you are.
I finally found you.

438
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:34,018
We seemed to have accidentally
dropped you upon entry.

439
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:37,154
Your fat servant
exceeded our weight limit.

440
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:39,461
Fat servant?

441
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:42,161
No, this is Muta. He's a friend.

442
00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:46,696
That's nice. Come on. Everyone's
dying to meet their new princess.

443
00:36:46,807 --> 00:36:49,173
Fat friend, you can come, too.

444
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:53,743
- I don't know about this.
- The king is waiting in your castle.

445
00:36:53,814 --> 00:36:57,079
- My castle?
- The royal palace.

446
00:36:58,018 --> 00:37:01,181
- My castle?
- Well, soon enough.

447
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:02,312
Hmm.

448
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,687
Hey, where do you think you're going?

449
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:08,227
The king's waiting for me.
It's rude not to say hi.

450
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:10,889
Have you completely lost your mind?

451
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:13,489
- This way.
- Wait a minute.

452
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,660
Can she come with us?

453
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:21,034
- Who are you?
- I'm Yuki. I serve at the royal table.

454
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:23,941
Oh, so you're employed by the king?

455
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:26,844
She works at the castle.
You'll see her there.

456
00:37:26,947 --> 00:37:29,006
- Come.
- See you soon, Yuki.

457
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:31,707
Ow, ow, ow! Hey!

458
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:40,184
Poor Haru.

Ugh, look at that. Creepy.

460
00:38:13,927 --> 00:38:17,658
Mmm, looks good.
My future daughter-in-law.

461
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:23,562
Hmm.

462
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:27,471
All right! Think I'll go
and have a look in person.

463
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:32,835
Hm. Why does that fatso
seem so familiar?

464
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,654
You'll need to change
before meeting the king.

465
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:51,628
I get new clothes?

466
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:54,428
- Please wait here, sir.
- I'm the baby-sitter.

467
00:38:54,534 --> 00:38:56,798
- Back off.
- What's your problem?

468
00:38:56,903 --> 00:39:00,031
Help yourself to refreshments
while you wait.

469
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:02,166
Yeah, okay, I'll wait.

470
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:09,208
Oh...

471
00:39:09,282 --> 00:39:11,648
Hey, not bad.

472
00:39:14,054 --> 00:39:16,386
Miss Haru, you're so lucky.

473
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:19,653
Every girl in the cat kingdom
has a crush on Prince Lune.

You what? I was told
you had already consented.

That's what I was told.

- What does the prince say?
- He is away on official business.

Look, first of all,
we don't really know each other

and second of all, he's a cat, right?

And I'm not.
So, clearly, I can't marry him.

Muta, what happened?

He had a weakness for catnip jelly.
He saw the bowl and dove right in.

Muta, you weren't supposed to die.
It's all my fault.

methodical, we'll find our way.

Keep your eye on the tower.
That will allow us to stay oriented.

Now this is more like it, babe.

636
00:52:49,702 --> 00:52:53,604
Hm, another dead end.
My, my, this is getting interesting.

637
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,006
Two rights and a left...

638
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:59,907
Wait a minute,
I know there wasn't a wall here.

639
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:04,143
- Your brain's overheating.
- We just walked through here, Muta.

640
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,980
What, walls have legs?

641
00:53:11,224 --> 00:53:13,988
She's right, Muta.
This wall is fake.

- Told you.
- Good work, Haru.

All right, fine, good work.

- Wait. It's not safe, Your Majesty.

Go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

Oh!

651
00:53:58,037 --> 00:53:59,265

- I can walk.
- Don't worry.

Hmm?

654
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:24,460
Your Majesty!
This is very dangerous.

655
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:25,997
I can't let them escape.

656
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:31,267
You'll never reach them in time.
Besides, we have guards in the tower.

657

- I'll have a word with the contractors.
- It's too late for that.

661
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:04,500
We'll have to use the detonator.

662

Not that, I beg of you, sire.

663

Think of what it will do
to your approval ratings.

664
00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:13,077
- Button.
- I must have left it in the castle.

665
00:55:13,145 --> 00:55:14,305
Look what I found.

666
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:16,472
No! Oh! No!

667
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:21,315
Hey, we made it to the top.

668
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:23,480
[Baron] Not much further now.

669
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,350
Bye-bye, tower.

You've got to be kidding.
We're back where we started.

675
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:05,125
Now what do we do?
Just stand here?

676
00:56:05,197 --> 00:56:06,687
Nothing else we can do.

Baron, nice to see you again.

680
00:56:16,776 --> 00:56:20,234
Princess, would you please
accompany me back to the castle?

681
00:56:21,914 --> 00:56:24,007
Being a cat's not so bad.

682
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:26,984
Do I have to learn to eat mice?

683
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:29,748
Perhaps you shouldn't give up
quite yet, Haru.

684
00:56:46,205 --> 00:56:49,174
What in the world has Father done now?

685
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:51,334
Father!

686
00:56:52,244 --> 00:56:55,407
Lune? You're back already?

687
00:56:56,115 --> 00:56:58,379
The prince is here. Line up!

688
00:56:58,451 --> 00:57:00,146
It's the prince?

689
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,692
Yuki sent a message
saying it was urgent I return.

690
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:11,389
Perhaps you'd like to tell me
what's going on?

691
00:57:11,897 --> 00:57:14,195
Miss Haru!

692
00:57:14,266 --> 00:57:17,099
- Yuki, you're here.
- I'm glad Lune made it in time.

693
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:19,831
I just wanted to repay
the girl who rescued you.

694
00:57:19,905 --> 00:57:22,738
And I thought, just maybe,
you would be happy

695
00:57:22,808 --> 00:57:26,437
to have a good-looking girl like Haru
for a bride.

696
00:57:26,545 --> 00:57:30,811
I have already chosen my bride.
I have decided to marry Yuki.

697
00:57:33,352 --> 00:57:35,013
That thing?

698
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,283
- Guess it was a surprise.
- I like this prince.

699
00:57:43,596 --> 00:57:47,828
This is for you. I traveled
to your old home to get these.

700
00:57:54,106 --> 00:57:56,836
I haven't had these in years.

701
00:57:56,942 --> 00:58:00,400
Wow.
I used to love those when I was a kid.

702
00:58:00,546 --> 00:58:06,382
I know. You fed me a whole box of these
when I was just a stray.

703
00:58:06,452 --> 00:58:09,012
That filthy little kitten was you?

704
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:12,557
You're so beautiful now,
I never would have recognized you.

705
00:58:12,691 --> 00:58:17,060
Yuki, will you accept these crackers
as a symbol of my love for you

706
00:58:17,129 --> 00:58:19,427
for as long
as our nine lives shall last?

707
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,767
So these crackers mean that

708
00:58:23,836 --> 00:58:26,566
you can marry the prince instead of me!

709
00:58:28,474 --> 00:58:31,568
I'm so happy for you.

710
00:58:31,644 --> 00:58:33,509
Thank you, Haru.

711
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:36,139
Thank you for feeding me
when I was a kitten.

712
00:58:36,215 --> 00:58:38,581
Without you
I might not be alive today.

713
00:58:38,684 --> 00:58:42,120
You're the girl with the fish crackers
Yuki told me about.

714
00:58:42,187 --> 00:58:45,714
And you also rescued me
when I nearly got killed by a truck.

715
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:50,022
We both owe you our lives, Haru.
What can we do to repay you?

716
00:58:50,095 --> 00:58:54,054
You don't have to repay me.
I'm just glad things turned out so well.

717
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:56,761
I guess I did the right thing after all.

718

[Sobbing]

719
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,904
This is all very moving.

720
00:59:04,009 --> 00:59:07,035
I had no idea
you had a bride in mind already.

721
00:59:07,112 --> 00:59:09,774
You should've told me.

722
00:59:09,848 --> 00:59:13,045
Poor Haru.
You must feel like such a loser.

723
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:15,416
- Not really.
- I'm sure you do.

724
00:59:15,487 --> 00:59:19,014
So, I have a great idea.
You should marry me instead.

725
00:59:19,959 --> 00:59:25,522
I'll get you some fish, too, as a symbol
of my undying love and all that.

726
00:59:25,598 --> 00:59:26,622
So?

727
00:59:26,732 --> 00:59:30,133
That's very generous,
but I just want to be myself.

728
00:59:30,202 --> 00:59:33,103
I'll change you back if you marry me.

729

Hm?

730
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,740
I've had just about enough of you.

731
00:59:38,911 --> 00:59:43,871
Nobody who decided who I am but me,
and there's no way I'd ever marry you.

732
00:59:47,052 --> 00:59:48,246
Was that a no?

733

Not a chance.

Even if she does stick her nose
in other people's business.

01:00:03,235 --> 01:00:05,999
So I, Renaldo Moon, will defend her.

740
01:00:06,071 --> 01:00:08,539
- Renaldo?
- Renaldo Moon?

741
01:00:08,607 --> 01:00:12,099
- The Renaldo Moon?
- So that's who he is.

742
01:00:12,177 --> 01:00:14,407
- Who?
- How could you have forgotten?

743
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,780
He's such a notorious criminal,
his story is written on our walls.

744
01:00:18,851 --> 01:00:21,786
Years back,
an enormous white cat appeared,

745
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:24,913
devoured all the fish in the lake
and then ran off.

746
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:28,721
He called himself Renaldo Moon.

747
01:00:28,827 --> 01:00:32,228
Did you really do that, Muta?
That's disgusting.

748
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:35,130
And this time
I'll eat the entire castle.

Please, sire, it's not safe.

Take Miss Haru to the exit. I'll hold
back the king as long as I can.

The tower collapsed.

It's all right, the exit is still there.

What are all these chickens doing here?

That's my school.

- Yes. But I had fun, too.

Really? I didn't.

Well then,
now that Haru's problem is solved,

I may have a little crush on you.
