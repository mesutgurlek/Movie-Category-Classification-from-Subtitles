marking the embarked traders
on the flood

Thou rememberest,

432

since once I sat
upon a promontory

433
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:49,206
and heard a mermaid
on a dolphin's back

434
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,845
uttering such dulcet
and harmonious breath

435
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:56,288
thatthe rude sea
grew civil athersong.

Acertain aim he took

440
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:13,572
and loosed his love shaftsmartly

441
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,269
from his bow.

442
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:19,040
Yet, marked I where
the boltofCupid fell.

443
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:22,049
It fell upon
a little western flower,
