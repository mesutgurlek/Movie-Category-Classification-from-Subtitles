Good morning, everybody.

Well, it's the last day of camp...

No. What a weird thing to say.

Oh, Coop, you know I'm just kidding.

I've had with her in six years of camp.

what she was asking you about?

Because, tell her that I will. In fact...

- if you were...
- Right. You would know that.

It would be a great idea...

85
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,772
if you came by the camp and
taught the campers about space.

No, I couldn't possibly.

You mean, she's the only girl at camp
you haven't done it with yet?

That's exactly what I mean.

This is an excuse to do
some good musical theater.

out of camp. - Why?

some crayons...

Haven't you been listening to what we've been
saying? We're trying to get our friend laid.

00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:31,872
- Ah! point taken.
- Okay. Tonight...

611
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:34,875
- Get McKinley laid.
- Come hell or high water?

612
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,842
Secret handshake?

[ Together ]
Get McKinley laid!

614
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,287
As everybody knows,

615
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:08,409
today is the big culminating,
climactic softball game...

616
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:11,912
- against evil Camp Tiger Claw.
- Boo!

617
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:14,415
We have put together
an unlikely...

618
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:18,168
team of misfits, and we've been
training like crazy all summer.

619
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,171
Yeah, it's a motley crew
that you'd think...

620
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,173
would never be able
to win a single game.

621
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,677
We had a kooky training period
where it seemed like...

622
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:29,680
it seemed like nothing was
gonna go right. But, guys,

623
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:31,780
somehow we made it
to the finals.

624
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:36,186
So I say, when those anonymously
evil campers from Tiger Claw get here,

625
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:40,190
we give it our best shot, and we try to
come from behind at the last minute...

626
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,193
with some weird trick play that we
made up and we win the game.

627
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:45,696
What do you say, team?

628
00:42:45,946 --> 00:42:47,448
It sounds like
well-worn territory.

629
00:42:47,948 --> 00:42:49,950
The whole thing feels kind of
trite. I say we forget it.

- Is that how everybody feels?
- [ Team ] Yeah.

Yeah, you're right. No problem, man.

and done before.

Okay? All right.

Susie is gonna score
with McKinley.

639
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:38,248
Then he's gonna need some
eyewitnesses for verification.

640

been working on is your talent tonight?

I love the way you laugh.

And I love the way
your hair smells.

And I love it that sometimes for
no reason, you're late for shul.

like to smear mud on my ass.

Maybe. I don't think so.

01:02:47,146 --> 01:02:51,150
I want to introduce you guys
to someone. This is my friend.

909
01:02:53,653 --> 01:02:56,155
I don't know who he is,
but I do know this.

910
01:02:56,656 --> 01:03:01,661
At a time when I was trying
to hide myself from myself,

911
01:03:01,696 --> 01:03:05,665
He was there to show me a new way.

912
01:03:07,667 --> 01:03:10,169
Because I couldn't hide from him.

913
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:14,173
And I can be proud of who I am.

The Hopkins award!

1221
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:55,737
And, NASA's hiring me to go to work
for them at Cape Canaveral, Florida.

1222
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:58,239
I'll have
a whole new life!

1223
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,707
That's wonderful.

1224
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:04,746
I knew this would happen. I would meet
you, fall in love and you would leave me.

1225
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:07,749
Wait, hold on, Beth.
I've already told them,

1226
01:28:07,784 --> 01:28:10,216
I need an apartment
for two people.

1227
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:13,720
- And they'll fly you back here
every summer. - Fuck you!

1228
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:18,760
And, Beth, I know we've been
having trouble with, you know...

1229
01:28:18,795 --> 01:28:21,763
but I was thinking when the
time comes, we can adopt.

1230
01:28:21,798 --> 01:28:24,731
Shh. It's happened.

1231
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:26,768
I'm pregnant.
We're gonna have a baby.

1232
01:28:27,268 --> 01:28:30,772
Oh. Oh, baby!

1233
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:33,408
- Good-bye, Beth.
- Oh, hey!

1234
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:35,910
Looks like everything
worked out for you two.

1235
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:38,413
Yeah, it's the best thing that's
ever happened in my life.

1236
01:28:38,448 --> 01:28:40,415
I hope you like shrimp cocktail,
because we want you...

1237
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:43,418
to be the guest of honor
at our wedding next week.

1238
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:45,920
We would be delighted.
But I hope it's not Jumbo shrimp...

1239

It was us rolling the dice
that diverted it, right?

- Not the enormous gust of wind, right?
- Right.

1246
01:29:23,207 --> 01:29:26,710
I feel like this entire summer,
which kind of sucked,

1247
01:29:26,745 --> 01:29:30,214
has been rejuvenated by the
events of the past 24 hours.

1248
01:29:30,249 --> 01:29:35,219
Yeah, it's like...
well, forget it.

- You know what?
- What?

1250
01:29:37,722 --> 01:29:41,726
You guys are my best friends.
Well, my only friends.

1251
01:29:41,761 --> 01:29:44,729
- Yeah.
- Nanoo-nanoo.

1252
01:29:51,736 --> 01:29:54,203
- So, this is it, babe.
- Yep.

1253
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:57,992
So, obviously I think we should get
together in the city next weekend.

1254
01:29:58,027 --> 01:30:02,639
- I'll call my parents, and you can
talk to your dad and Kim. - Listen.

1255
01:30:02,674 --> 01:30:07,251
Last night was really great. You were
incredibly romantic and heroic.

1256
01:30:07,286 --> 01:30:10,219
No doubt about it.
And that's great.

1257
01:30:10,254 --> 01:30:13,723
But I've thought about it,
and my thing is this:

1258
01:30:13,758 --> 01:30:16,761
Andy's really hot. And don't
get me wrong, you're cute too.

1259
01:30:17,261 --> 01:30:21,731
But Andy is like cut from
marble. He's gorgeous.

1260
01:30:21,766 --> 01:30:25,770
He's like this beautiful face
and this incredible body,

1261
01:30:25,805 --> 01:30:29,774
and I genuinely don't care
that he's kind of lame.

1262
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:33,027
I don't even care
that he cheats on me.

1263
01:30:33,528 --> 01:30:36,496
And I like you more than
I like Andy, Coop, but I'm 16.

1264
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:39,534
And maybe it will be a different story
like when I'm ready to get married.

1265
01:30:39,569 --> 01:30:43,538
But right now, I'm entirely
about sex. I just want Andy.

1266
01:30:44,038 --> 01:30:46,005
- Yeah.
- I wanna take him,

1267
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:50,044
And grab him and just fuck
his brains out, you know?

1268
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:52,564
So that's where my
priorities are right now.

1269
01:30:52,599 --> 01:30:55,325
Sex. Specifically with Andy
and not with you.

1270
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,052
But you're really nice.
Everybody thinks so.

1271
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:02,557
And I'm sorry if this isn't the direction
you saw things going between us.

1272
01:31:02,592 --> 01:31:05,577
I still totally want
to be friends.

1273
01:31:05,612 --> 01:31:08,563
You better write me
a letter, okay?

1274
01:31:08,598 --> 01:31:11,016
Sure.

1275
01:31:11,051 --> 01:31:13,434
Cool?

1276
01:31:16,437 --> 01:31:19,440
Katie, let's go.
