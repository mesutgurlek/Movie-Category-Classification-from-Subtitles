That was before the accident.
And what happened?

165
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,819
One day, when my mother and father
were singing together in the forest,

166
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,339
a great storm
blew up out of nowhere.

167
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,299

that they did not notice

168
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,179
nor did they stop
as the rain began to fall.

169
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,499
And when their voices rose
for the final bars of the duet,

170
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,499
a great bolt of lightning came out
of the sky and struck my father,

171
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,619
and then he lit up like a torch.

172
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,579
And at the same moment
my father was struck dead,

173
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,379
