There's a swimming pool, a health

Sir?

168
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,599
I'm starting to get a little upset.

169
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,359

Have you found them?

170
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,039
Yes. There's absolutely
no reason to be upset.

171
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,719
They're downstairs in storage,
and I'll bring them up

172
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,359
just as soon as I get this
lovely couple to their cabin.

be sorry to leave room 6088,

Oh. And, you two

- Big enough for you?

Well, size doesn't matter.
You know that.

Yes!

Why? I mean, all of the sudden,
I have Love Boat fever.

It feels really good.

201

I'm really, truly excited
about being on a cruise ship.

I don't know why.

203
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,119
Maybe they, like, pump drugs

204
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,279
through, like, the air conditioning
system or something like that.

Yeah, you know what I need?

the big boat besides me?

What's the matter?
You look a little tense.

- Yes.

that if you look at it...

even know each other.

You think that's the harbor?

He's taking us to the cliffs

Now, look, you've lost
control of autopilot,

849

01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,599
Wait a minute.

1136
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,399
I've heard that music before.

1137
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,399
Yeah, it's the music they
pipe in all over the ship.

1138
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,799
No, no, no. I've heard
this music before.

1139
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,487
Uh, ship-shopping music.
He's in the mall.

1140
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,479
There's a fire in there.

1141
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,519
Well, don't worry.

1142
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,729
The flames won't get
past the fire doors.

1143
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,599
Alex.

1144
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,679
Alex, Alex.

1145
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,208
- JULIANO: Don't touch that!
- Okay.

1146
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,719
I need a... I need a...

1147
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:44,079
I need my saw. I need my saw.

1148
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,719
Shit! Alex!

1149
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,159
Alex! Oh, God.

1150
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,719
Don't touch anything.
Don't touch anything!

1151
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,159
I know where to release
the fire doors.

1152
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,999
Don't open the door.
Don't. It's a trap.

1153
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,279
There's something in the door.

1154
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,479
Baby, we can't get in to you.
There's something in the door.

1155
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,399
Calm down. What does it look like?

1156
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,999
Wait. What does it look like?

1157
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,519
Okay, it's green...

1158
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,519
Like a spray deodorant can.

1159
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,639
I don't know. Can't think.

1160
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,679
Okay. It's a grenade.

1161
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:10,799
What?

1162
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,879
There's a number on it. There
should be a number on it.

1163
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,119
Uh, okay, yeah.

1164
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,839
It's L-1619...

1165
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,039
Magnum.

1166
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,679
- Is the pin out?
- What?

1167
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,359
- Is the pin out?
- No, the pin's still in,

1168
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:26,199
- but it's attached to a wire.
- Yeah.

1169
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,719
You're gonna have to tie
the spoon to the grenade.

1170
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,199
- Spoon? What?
- With a string.

1171
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,479
Oh, baby, don't say grenade.

1172
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:34,881
Okay. A string.

1173
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,679
Your shoelace!

1174
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,319
Come on.

1175
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,759
I got it.

1176
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:41,879
That's it.

1177
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,039
Okay, all right.

1178
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,079
Okay.

1179
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,881
Okay, be real careful.

1180
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,839
ANNIE:
All right. Here it goes. Uh...

1181
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,359
You gotta hurry up.

1182
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,807
Okay, Okay.

1183
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,519
Got it. Got it.

1184
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,079
Got it. What now?

1185
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:05,643
Pull the pin out and
remove the grenade.

1186
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,291
Uh... Uh...

1187
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,999
You pull out the pin, and
I will pull out the grenade.

1188
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,164
- Okay.
- On the count of three. One...

1189
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,199
Two...

1190
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:21,726
Three.

1191
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,481
(GRUNTING)

1192
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,759
Where is it? Where is it?

1193
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,879
Where is it?

1194
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,359
It's in your hand.

1195
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,639
Where? Take it out. Take it out!

1196
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,159
Take it out. Take it out.
Got it? Take it.

1197
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:39,479
- I got it.
- Okay, got it?

1198
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:42,042
- Yeah.
- Alex!

1199
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,319
You can open the door now.

1200
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,768
Okay.

1201
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,361
(BEEPING)

1202
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,565
No.

1203
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,639
Here's some more dry towels.

1204
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,565
Thank you.

1205
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,199
I am so sorry I yelled at you.

1206
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,919
That's Okay, Dad.

1207
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,163
I'm okay.

1208
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:41,130
Okay.

1209
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,159
Where's Alex?

1210
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,085
"Where's Alex?"

1211
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,486
(COUGHING)

1212
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:54,410
Come over here.

1213
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,279
- Just sit down. Don't talk. Don't move.
- I'm okay.

1214
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,679
You're not okay. Stop saying that.

1215
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,366
All right?

1216
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,610
Are you okay?

1217
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:10,359
I don't think so.

1218
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,285
What?

1219
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,079
He's adjusting starboard.

1220
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,439
ANNIE: What does that mean?

1221
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,039
Does that mean right, left, around the
island, what? What does that mean?

1222
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,919
No. Right into the island.

1223
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,399
ANNIE: We're moving again.

1224
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,879
JULIANO: He's turning us
1/2 a degree starboard.

1225
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,559
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, guys.

1226
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,246
We're getting closer.

1227
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,799
Okay. I'm cutting the
serial port connection.

1228
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,123
- Anything?
- Uh...

1229
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:36,010
No, we're still locked out.

1230
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,084
Come on.

1231
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,559
MERCED: Hey, we're moving.

1232
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,079
We have control again.

1233
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:44,399
No, we're still dead here.

1234
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,239
Are you sure, sir,
because we're turning.

1235
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,279
It's him.

1236
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,959
It's him, it's him, it's him.

1237
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,399
He's on board.
Geiger's still on board.

1238
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,802
Hey, guys. Guys, maybe
these people can help.

1239
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,719
JULIANO: Hand me those.

1240
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,088
Right there.

1241
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,968
He's taking us right
into an oil tanker.

1242
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,879
What?

1243
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,199
You're right.

1244
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:13,399
She's anchored 16 miles out,
and we are doing 17.8 knots.

1245
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:14,919
Well, how long till they move?

1246
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:17,439
From starting their
engines, 30 minutes.

1247
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,839
There's no chance they're gonna
get out of our way in time.

1248
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,164
So, what... What...
What does that mean?

1249
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,970
Oh, man!

1250
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,808
Uh, he's turning us another 1/4.

1251
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,011
Ah! Damn it. (GROANS)

1252
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,159
Can we turn the ship
without the rudder?

1253
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,239
MERCED:
The bow thrusters would do it.

1254
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:46,719
JULIANO: We can't get there now.
You guys flooded the access.

1255
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,199
Yeah, well, we also messed
up his program, sir.

1256
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,559
No, you almost sunk us.

1257
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,439
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1258
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,799
Let's take a wrench and
dump it into the engine

1259
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,959
and bust the transmission like
a car 'cause I've done that.

1260
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,319
With all due respect,
this is not your car.

1261
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,199
- This is a cruise liner.
- ALEX: She's right. It's a propeller.

1262
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,639
We got to stop the propeller.

1263
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,159
You could wedge something
into it underneath the ship,

1264
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,479
(STAMMERING) like a steel cable.

1265
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,159
This is not my
suggestion, obviously.

1266
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,039
Great idea. I'll go under the ship.

1267
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,159
No, you won't.

1268
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,399
No, you won't. That's
not what I meant.

1269
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:19,479
That's a stupid idea.

1270
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,679
- No, it's a great idea.
- No.

1271
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,439
It's suicide. These blades
are 12 feet across.

1272
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,490
They'll suck you in and kill you.

1273
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,239
Hey. Hey, Dino, I got one for you.

1274
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:49,159
Okay, who played the German
captain in <i>The Enemy Below?</i>

1275
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:51,164
Curt Jurgens.

1276
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,359
Down the next stairwell
on the left,

1277
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,959
straight to the bowels of the ship.

1278
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,488
Bowels. That doesn't
sound very good.

1279
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,559
How much time left?

1280
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,803
Not very much. We better hurry.

1281
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:12,679
Mayday, Mayday.

1282
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,239
This is <i>Seabourn Legend</i> bearing
80 degrees east-northeast.

1283
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,959
Engine and steering
control nonfunctional.

1284
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,805
I repeat. Nonfunctional.

1285
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,999
Where are we going?

1286
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,199
<i>Eindhoven Lion.</i>

1287
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,279
<i>Eindhoven Lion</i>, come in.

1288
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,759
This is <i>Seabourn Legend.</i>

1289
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,959
<i>Eindhoven Lion</i>, come in.

1290
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,759
<i>Eindhoven Lion</i>, this
is <i>Seabourn Legend.</i>

1291
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,481
Come in, <i>Eindhoven Lion.</i>

1292
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,769

Alex, maybe this isn't
such a hot idea.

1298
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,239
Maybe you should just leave
the propeller alone, huh?

1299
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,130
We have to stop the ship.

Yeah. We use those lines
all over the ship.

- Annie, Annie. It's okay. It'll hold.

Feed it into the propeller, and
it will pull the heavy cable in.

I kind of requested you.

I wanted to make up for last week.
