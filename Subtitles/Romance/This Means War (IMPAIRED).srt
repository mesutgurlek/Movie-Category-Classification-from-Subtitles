A little of both.

What kind of business?

14
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,667
I am a cruise ship captain

00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,959
There's some calcining
around the edges.

However, the Tempolite has damage
and there's rusting around 300 degrees.

58
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,634
So that means the Cortex
gets the recommend.

311
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,608
No, no, no.
My friend, Trish, is....

312
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,862
Oh, no. Everybody should have a friend
who's a spaz.

313
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,906
I think I'm going to have to kill her.
Well, actually...

314
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,450
...I might be able to help you.
I'm kidding.

315
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,578
So am I.
FRANKENSTEIN {ON TV}: Love...

316
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,914
...is the only thing
that can save this poor creature.

317
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,418
And I am going to convince him
that he is loved...

318
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,754
...even at the cost of my own life.

319
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:38,426
No matter what you hear in there,
no matter how cruelly I beg you...

320
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,928
...no matter how terribly I may scream...
Hi.

321
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,597
{CELL PHONE RINGING}

322
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:47,101
FRANKENSTEIN: ...do not open this door
or you will undo everything I've worked for.

323
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,687
Good for you, pal.

324
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,106
So tell me one thing
that's not on your profile.

325
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,941
Um....

326
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,109
I have a son.

327
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,904
Oh, you do?
Yeah. He's called Joe.

328
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:01,741
He's 7 and he's really lovely.
Really lovely.

329
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,910
And his mom?

330
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,453
Couldn't work.

331
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,789
How about you?

332
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,042
No kids that I know of.
Okay.

333
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,293
And no ex-wives.

334
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,672
I have a very important question to ask.
Good. Go on.

335
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,134
Have you ever been or do you
ever plan on being a serial killer?

336
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,512
Well, I mean, it's--
You got to keep your options open.

337
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,681
But, no.
Okay, good answer. Ha-ha-ha.

338
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,600
{BOTH LAUGHING}

339
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,811
So you've never killed anybody
with your bare hands.

340
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,647
Not this week.

341
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,190
Great.

342
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,443
Lauren, you're incredible.
You're not so bad yourself.

343
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:43,157
All right, I'm going to go and rent a movie
and take a cold shower.

344
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,659
I will too.
Okay.

345
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,453
And wait for your call for the next--
Five minutes?

346
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,121
{LAUGHS}

347
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,290
HENRY {ON TV}:
This is where it all started.

348
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,126
Yes, I was standing over there
by that desk.

349
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:58,130
MARTHA: No, you were sitting in the chair.
And suddenly, you started walking toward me.

350
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,424
Very slowly. Very slowly.

351
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,009
I could count every step.

352
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,428
And when you're walking towards me
very slowly...

353
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,598
...I thought, "What's the matter with him?
Can't he walk faster?"

354
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,394
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry. You take it.

355
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,688
No, no, no, that's okay. You take it.
Sure?

356
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,358
You're not going to like it. Twist ending.
You'll see it coming a mile away.

357
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:22,196
And how would you know what I like?
I know movies. And women.

358
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,116
Really?
Mm-hm.

359
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,493
Okay.

360
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,371
Well, then,
why don't you tell me what I want?

361
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,209
The Lady Vanishes? Why is that?
Mm-hm.

362
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,504
Well, firstly, you can never go wrong
with Hitchcock. Ever.

363
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,424
It's got comedy, drama, romance,
it's a thriller.

364
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,300
It's classy, but not stuffy.

365
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,763
A little obscure, so if you haven't seen it,
you'll thank me for introducing you to it.

366
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,058
If you have, you'll know
what a good choice it was.

367
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,020
Well, I have seen it.
Mm-hm.

368
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,105
And it is a really good choice.
Mm.

369
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,109
However, not as good as Rebecca,
Notorious, Vertigo...

370
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,404
...or pretty much any of his films
from 1960 to 1972.

371
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,241
In fact, it's sort of a second-tier title.

372
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,243
A second.

373
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,580
You know what? Scratch--
Look, I see you surveying the prospects.

374
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,750
That one over there in Foreign?
Too much angst.

375
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:18,711
This one in the sweater set,
picking out animated movies?

376
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,505
That girl will have your children named
before breakfast.

377
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,175
The problem is,
no one looks like a clean getaway.

378
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:27,261
I get it. You come in here
looking for a girl renting a movie.

379
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,723
Clearly, she doesn't have a date
for the night. We're easy targets.

380
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,434
You look like the guy
interested in a one-day rental...

381
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,562
...if you know what I mean.
If you knew anything about women...

382
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,192
...or anything about me, I'm perfectly
capable of choosing my own movies.

383
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,777
But thanks.

384
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,737
Happy hunting.

385
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,949
Hm.

386
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,954
MAN: So, sir, you want me to hack
into a video store database?

387
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,999
FDR: It's for the Heinrich case.
COMPUTER VOICE: Searching database.

388
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,837
FDR:
All right, keep on scrolling.

389
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,839
Wait. Stop. Scroll back.

390
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,466
That's her.

391
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,513
Sir, how is this girl
connected to Heinrich?

392
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,973
That's G-4 classified.

393
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,645
Hello, everybody, I'm Lauren Scott.
Thank you so much for being here today.

394
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,522
ALL:
Good morning, Lauren.

395
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,484
We're here today to talk about grills.
Does anybody have any first impressions?

396
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,277
I like the rotisserie feature.

397
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,113
Perfect. That's very helpful.

398
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,115
FDR:
I don't think it heated up fast enough.

399
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,869
Like something was wrong with the motor,
maybe the spark was dead.

400
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,539
Actually, sir,
there's nothing wrong with the spark.

401
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,626
Some people think grills
just burst into flames at the slightest touch.

402
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,002
It doesn't work like that.

403
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,506
Does anybody have any useful opinions?

404
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,384
I thought the lid was hard to handle.
Mm-hm.

405
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,011
Ugh. The lids, what a pain, right?

406
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:56,517
I just felt the whole thing to be a bit stiff,
uptight, not really user-friendly.

407
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,061
I think it depends on the user.
Mm.

408
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,689
It so happens I have
a lot of experience with grills.

409
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,733
I'm something of a grill master.

410
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,904
Uh, this is a sophisticated grill. Not sure
you've dealt with one of those before.

411
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,825
Or maybe a grill like this
is just so scared of being burned...

412
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,537
...it stays on simmer
and never really heats up all the way.

413
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,207
Don't touch my grill.
I don't think this can handle a guy like me.

414
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,542
I think it could.
Really?

415
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,378
Easily.
Prove it. 8 p.m. Barcelona. Tomorrow.

416
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,172
I don't think so.

417
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,300
I guess I could stick around
a little longer, talk about grills.

418
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,927
Charcoal or gas,
number 19, what do you think?

419
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,430
If I say yes, will you leave?
This is my job.

420
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,599
Eight p.m. tomorrow.
Fine.

421
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,060
Fine.
Fine.

422
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,606
{SNIFFS}

423
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,566
You smell nice.

424
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,277
Bye.

425
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,746
What were you doing
on the computer? Porn?

426
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,749
I have a photograph of my girl.
I was doing the same thing.

427
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,085
A background check.
I don't know if that's creepy or romantic.

428
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,713
"Cromantic." I do it all the time.
Want to see?

429
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,590
Yeah, sure. Want to see her?
Yeah.

430
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,759
I bet yours has got antlers and howls.

431
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,303
She does, but she's
incredibly attractive with them.

432
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,888
She's a 10.
Go on three.

433
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,640
One, two, three and go? All right.

434
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,099
Okay. I'll sound off.
Okay.

435
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,935
One...
One.

436
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,103
...two, three.

437
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,110
That's, uh, Lauren S--
Lauren? Lauren Scott?

438
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,362
Scott.

439
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:37,159
That's the girl from the video store?
Right around the corner from the bar.

440
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,619
Oh, wow. Um....

441
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:45,209
I had no idea.
Of course. How could you know that?

442
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,587
Did she, ahem, actually say she wanted
to go out on a date with you, though?

443
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,466
You know what? I'm going to make this
really easy. I'm going to bow out. You date her.

444
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,135
Hang on. Did she say
she wanted to go out with you?

445
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,805
It doesn't matter.
I love you. You're my best friend.

446
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,557
Yeah.
You go date her.

447
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,477
Yeah, if I got in the picture,
it wouldn't be fair.

448
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,354
Well, I'm sorry. What does that mean?

449
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,689
{SIGHS}

450
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,400
What does that mean?
I mean, come on, man...

451
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,527
...you're not out there
as much as I am.

452
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,195
And like anything...

453
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,448
...practice makes, uh....
Perfect?

454
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,200
No, no, no.
You're perfect?

455
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,995
Maybe not perfect,
but damn near close...

456
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,329
Wow.

457
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,666
...to perfect.
You believe that as well?

458
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,961
You don't have to bow out because of me.
I don't?

459
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,172
I'm not concerned that she's going to
fall in love with you, pal.

460
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,843
How very nice of you. Thank you.

just so proud that Tuck is into girls again.

a really great brother.

He is.
He saved me from becoming a swinger.

village used to call me "The Sausage Wallet."

Heard they weren't real. They look real to me.

"These knockers. Oh!

That was the weirdest five minutes of my life.

1410

I'm sorry. Those people back there,
they are not my parents.

They're not my parents.

No.

1413
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:08,961
I wanted you to think that I had
a perfect family, so I hired some people.

You hired people?
Yes.

1415

You hired what kind of people?
Actors. Actors.

1416
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:16,844
Tuck, this is just bizarre.
I don't know what to say about that.

1417
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:19,430
I don't have any parents.
I have no family.

1418
01:15:19,723 --> 01:15:21,474
What?
I thought it would impress you.

1419
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:25,728
Okay? That's why I hired some, because
I thought that was normal. I thought--

1420
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,272
But you have a family. You have a son.

1421

Yeah.

my relationship with Joe is really awful.

It's really awful.

When he was a little boy, it was great.
He was a puppy.

1425
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:44,455
He loved me to bits. Then he grew up,
now I can't reach him.

1426
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,333
He doesn't want anything
to do with me, at all.

1427
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:51,921
Okay? So I didn't want you to see that.
It's actually very embarrassing.

1428
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:56,634
So I thought I'd hire a family,
because I thought that was normal.

1429
01:15:57,844 --> 01:16:00,680
Right, look, I totally understand
you needing to walk away...

...because if I were you,
I'd walk away too.
