1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,233
[Meredith] You know how when you were
a kid and you believed in fairy tales?

2
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,002
[Nellie McKay: David]

3
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,842
That fantasy of what your life would be.

4
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,144
White dress, Prince Charming,

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:21,051
who'd carry you away
to a castle on a hill.

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,454
You'd lie in bed at night
and close your eyes,

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,118
and you had complete and utter faith.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,184
[Sighs]

9
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,720
Eight hours, 16 ounces of chocolate
and 32 cupcakes,

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,733
and they still don't taste right.

11
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,393
No, these are good.

12
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,198
Martha Stewart would be proud.

13
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:39,636
Yeah, look where it got her.

14
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,802
[Meredith] Santa Claus,
the Tooth Fairy, Prince Charming,

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,811
they were so close, you taste them.

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,643
There's something missing,
some specific ingredient.

17
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,307
Why can't I remember?

18
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,351
But eventually, you grow up.

19
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:56,355
One day you open your eyes,
and the fairy tale disappears.

20
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,823
Look, just call her.
Call your mother and ask.

21
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,861
Most people turn to the things
and people they can trust.

22
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,589
I don't want to call my mother.

23
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:09,191
So let's go sleep at your house tonight.

24
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,736
What?

25
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,669
Why are we always sleeping at my house?

26
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,139
- Do you even have one?
- One what?

27
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,574
A house. With a closet.

28
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,171
With your stuff in it.
Your personal stuff.

29
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,181
Do you even have one of those?

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,783
Mmm.

31
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,319
Good morning.

32
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,821
- [George] Hey. You guys want a cupcake?
- Oh, no.

33
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,447
Izzie made them.

34
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:32,786
I like it here.

35
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,226
You said yourself,
you liked having your things around,

36
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,957
sleeping in your own bed.

37
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,658
You're like a health nut.

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,563
You eat muesli every morning.

39
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,828
No, I don't.

40
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,930
OK, the muesli thing, you do.

41
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,565
The last seven days, at least.

42
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,234
Oh, come on.

43
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,939
I haven't been here for a whole week.

44
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,547
- Have I?
- See?

45
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,881
Even they think it's weird.

46
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,114
[Meredith] But the thing is,

47
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,487
it's hard to let go
of that fairy tale entirely.

48
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:09,289
Almost everyone still
has that smallest bit of hope,

49
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,798
of faith, that one day
they'll open their eyes

50
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,561
and it will all come true.

51
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,943
[Door opens]

52
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,842
So I've checked the schedule.

53
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,438
I start ENT On the 9th.
It's a light rotation.

54
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,245
Can you get me in then?

55
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,478
Oh, I'm afraid not.

56
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,420
We have openings on the 16th.

57
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,755
There are other options
besides termination, you know?

58
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,692
Adoption,

59
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,094
keeping the baby.

60
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,156
You think it over. Call me back.

61
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,133
- I'm here...
- Put me down for the 16th.

62
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,363
I'll confirm after
I rearrange my schedule.

63
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,268
I know this is a difficult decision.

64
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,604
- You know the talking part?
- Mm.

65
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,837
I'm not interested.

66
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,515
So, Devo, you just
had a root canal, correct?

67
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,641
Yeah.

68
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,912
I couldn't stop bleeding after,
literally.

69
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,716
Now I'm stuck with you guys.

70
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:10,847
Give me the bullet.

71
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,893
17-year-old female hospitalized
for excessive bleeding,

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,861
post root canal.
Also a significant new heart murmur

73
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,990
associated with fever.
Now afebrile on antibiotics.

74
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,000
If I'm gonna die,
page my mom and dad?

75
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,161
You're not dying.
Where are your parents?

76
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,604
In the cafeteria.
My freak father likes hospital food.

77
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,838
[Burke] You're in excellent hands.
Dr. Karev is gonna run some labs.

78
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,506
And I'll see you with your parents
in a little while.

79
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,607
Add a bleeding time to the coags.

80
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,451
So, what kind of name is Devo, anyway?

81
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,117
'80s rocker.
My parents did too much blow.

82
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,353
I call myself Esther.

83
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,362
Nice skirt. What are you, Amish?

84
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,160
Get a life. Haven't you
ever seen an Orthodox Jew?

85
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,729
This guy belongs in Psych.
What are you doing turfing him here?

86
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,469
My gift to you. Had a seizure two
days ago and another one this morning.

87
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:07,445
What are you talking about?
It says, "He talks to dead people,

88
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:10,346
family thinks he's dangerous.
They had him committed."

89
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,008
That's Psych, not Neuro.

90
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,552
Didn't you go to med school?

91
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,714
Yes, unlike the correspondence
school you attended...

92
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,384
- Oh, that would be Stanford, right?
- I learned not to jump to conclusions.

93
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,258
Sorry, ladies. We can't take
him back until he's cleared.

94
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,796
You're dumping him on us?

95
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,695
He thinks his seizures are visions.

96
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,064
Hello! They're not seizures.
I'm psychic.

97
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,695
[Cristina] Of course you are,
and I'm a chicken.

98
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,830
Hey, genius.

99
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,040
OK, Mr. Duff.
We're gonna start our workup now.

100
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,706
Work me up, work me down, waste of time.

101
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,215
Well, humor us.
Can you grip my fingers, please?

102
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,452
Cristina.

103
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,322
Mr. Duff?

104
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,726
Mr. Duff, are you OK?

105
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,690
[Breathes deeply] Someone...

106
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,662
Someone what?

107
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,328
Someone's gonna check out.

108
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,633
Bye-bye.

109
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,866
Oh, man, he's nuts.

110
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,305
I'm dizzy, not deaf, lady.

111
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,866
Someone on the fourth floor
is gonna die.

112
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,710
[Man over PA] Code blue,
fourth floor. Code blue, fourth floor.

113
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,771
[Man] Got a code.

114
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:18,476

Fourth floor, dead guy.

The psychic predicted
the fourth floor dead guy.

00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,199
I need someone to cover me
on the 16th. You in?

121
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,098
I'm thinking about letting my hair grow.

122

And maybe I won't shave.
Go for the stubble effect.

123

What do you think?

124
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,078
The 16th, George.
Can you cover me or not?

125
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,710
Uh, yeah. I guess. Why?

126
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,516
It's none of your business.

127
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,183
A thank-you would be nice.

128

It's just that I hardly know
anything about you.

I'm from New York. I like ferry boats.

Enough with the ferry boats.
What about your friends?

- I'm a surgeon. I don't have friends.
- Everybody has friends.

I mean, who do you hang out with?

These are important questions.

Ah, important for who?

- You have more details than most.
- This is going somewhere weird.

I want facts, and until I get them,
my pants are staying on.

Your daughter needs
a valve replacement.

149
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,042
Tests indicate von Willebrand's disease,

150
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,983
which explains excessive
bleeding after the root canal.

151
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,041
And that means?

152
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,954
Devo can't take the blood thinners
to maintain a mechanical heart valve.

153
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,322
We're suggesting
a porcine valve instead.

154
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,294
Porcine? As in pig?

155
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,126
It's the standard of care
for someone in this situation.

Pig, huh?

157
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,166
It's the other white meat.

and he's having a conversion reaction.

00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,785
And then I realized
Dr. Burke can transplant

476
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,554
a bovine mitral valve
instead of the pig.

477
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,822
She can get a cow valve?

478
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,694
- Why wasn't this mentioned before?
- Dr. Karev.

479
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,666
The bovine valve has only been
an option the last few years.

480
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,794
It's a much more complicated procedure.

481
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,431
But the best part
is it's superior to the pig.

482
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,237
It lasts longer.

483
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,244
What small fraction
of your brain were you using?

484
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,779
- What?
- Correct me if wrong,

485
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:20,045
but did you not present an alternative
without consulting your attending first?

486
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,383
- I thought you'd be...
- Impressed? That's just stupid.

487
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,480
- Sorry...
- We're finished here, Karev.

488
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,388
You're off this case.

489
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,938
You need to sign these consent forms
so we can proceed with your surgery.

490
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,411
I'm not signing anything
unless it's got my name

491
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,471
followed by a whole bunch of zeros.

492
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,882
Look, the AVM is located
in this crucial part of the brain.

493
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,045
A tangle of blood vessels
that could burst

494
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,112
and affect speech, among other things.

495
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:01,215
- We know your visions are seizures.
- Do you?

496
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,853
- Do I what?
- Know they're seizures.

497
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,057
You're really good
at reading people, aren't you?

498

Telling them what they want to hear?

499
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,902
There's an unfortunate alignment
of Saturn in the house of Jupiter now.

OK. I know what you're doing.

501

Hmm.

I'm gonna do a quick pelvic exam.
The OB resident should be down soon.

512
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:47,103
It's a short procedure.
Your husband can stay if he likes.

513
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,538
- We changed our minds.
- Excuse me?

514
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,337
We've decided to keep the baby.

515
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,277
You have cancer.

516
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:57,509
Can you tell me I'll survive
if I go through with this?

517
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:02,418
Having the procedure does not
necessarily improve the outcome.

518
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,955
You have quite the bedside manner.
You know that?

519
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:10,158
My mom died of breast cancer
when she was in her 40s.

I have that cancer gene.

Don't bother.
I am going to get fat and happy

00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,419
What is it?

634
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,965
It's me.

635
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,940
I think it's about to be over.

636
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,737
We know what we're doing, Mr. Duff.

637
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:10,110
You saw the angio results.
We're catching the AVM just in time.

638
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,809
You don't need to be nervous.
You're not gonna die.

639
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,946
I'm not talking about dying.

640
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,956
My whole life has been about what I see

641
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,998
and about believing in myself,
whatever people think.

642
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:31,035
You're telling me there's
a chance that will go away.

643
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,396
Look, you're a healthy guy.

644
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,032
You're gonna live a long, full life.

645
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,837
If your psychic visions are real,

646
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,038
you've got to believe you'll have them
when you come out.

[Woman praying in Hebrew]

649
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,402
[Doctor] She's good.

650
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,468
This is Dr. Chesney
from the Cleveland Clinic.

651
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:52,846
He's an expert on bovine
valve replacement surgery.

652
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,681
He will be assisting via satellite.

653
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,281
Thank you, doctor.

654
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:02,520
After the sternotomy
and connection to bypass,

655
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,255
we're going to do
a transverse left atriotomy

656
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,661
to expose the valve.

657

[Inhales]

658
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:22,503
I tried to talk Shepherd
out of that clot surgery.

659
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,070
What is wrong with me?

660
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:27,447
- Basically, you tried to kill the guy.
- Basically, you're an ass.

661
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,715
You know you want it.
Come to papi, baby.

662
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,155
This, uh, is George.

663
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,352
George has a hot date.

664
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,260
[Laughing] Oh, that's great, George.

665

Yeah.

Left pocket of my lab coat, Georgie.

No glove, no love.

668
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,448
[Sighs] My psychic had his surgery.

669
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,186
Yeah?

670
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,018
I wonder what happened with his... gift.

671
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,490
Come on. We all know he's crazy.

672
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,493
You said you didn't believe in that.

673
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,330
I grew up in a trailer park.

674
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,732
I waited tables, which was
supposed to put me through college,

675
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:22,330
but my mother was always calling these

676
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,966
psychics all the time.

677
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:29,271
The bills started piling up,
so I had to use my money to pay them.

678
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,872
When I turned 18,
I left and never went back.

679
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,918
But this guy has been
saying things to me,

680
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,887
things he couldn't possibly
know anything about.

681
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,455
So I just wonder.

682
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,164
Do you have sensation anywhere else?

683
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,928
Some feeling in my stomach
and feet, I guess.

684
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,732
- Bladder and bowels?
- Not so good still.

685
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,637
The pressure stockings
help relieve clots and bedsores?

686
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,038
[Grey] They do.

687

I wanted to thank you for everything.

Believing in me,
that I wasn't making it up.

689
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,388
Well, I'll come back tomorrow, then.

[Mr. Walker] I wanted
to show you something.

I wasn't sure it would last,
but now look.

I know it's hardly anything, but...

No, it's something.

694

of the day, faith is a funny thing.

Mr. Duff, you're still with us.

...one tablespoon coconut extract.

that it's happy ever after.
