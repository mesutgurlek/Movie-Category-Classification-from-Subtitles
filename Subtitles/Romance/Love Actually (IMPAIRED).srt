me going without you?

No, really. I'm just feeling so rotten.

- I love you.
- I know.

48
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:27,246
I love you even when you're sick
and look disgusting.

49

I know. Now, go or you will actually miss it.

Right.

Karen, it's me again.

I'm sorry, I literally don't have
anybody else to talk to.

54
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:07,164
Absolutely. Horrible moment, though.
Can I call you back?

55
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,640
Of course.

56
00:05:08,687 --> 00:05:12,475
Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned
that your wife just died.

57
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:14,643
Understood.

58
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,996
Er, bugger off, call me later.

59
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,205
So what's this big news?

60
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,841
We've been given our parts
in the nativity play

61
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:26,639
and I'm the lobster.

62
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,325
- The lobster?
- Yeah.

63
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:32,076
- In the nativity play?
- Yeah. First Lobster.

64
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:35,324
There was more than one lobster present
at the birth of Jesus?

65
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,323
Duh.

66
00:05:41,647 --> 00:05:43,877
Best sandwiches in Britain.

67
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:47,242
Try my lovely nuts?

68
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:52,121
Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady.

69
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:57,363
Morning, my future wife.

70
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,078
(Man) OK, you can stop there. Thanks.

71
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,436
(2nd man) I need a couple of orange gels.

72
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:22,797
By the way, he introduced me as John
but everyone calls me Jack.

73
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:25,805
Oh, fine. Nice to meet you, Jack.

74
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:27,917
He got me right, though. I'm just Judy.

75
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:30,401
Great, Just Judy!

76
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:37,880
- No surprises?
- No surprises.

77
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:41,317
- Not like the stag night?
- Unlike the stag night.

78
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,882
- You admit the prostitutes were a mistake?
- I do.

79
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:48,317
And it would've been much better
if they'd not turned out to be men?

80
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,358
That is true.

81
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:54,677
Good luck, kiddo.

82
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,517

83
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:19,600

84
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:30,446
(Cheering)

85
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:32,478
Thank you.

86
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:38,159
- Welcome, Prime Minister.
- Woh! I must work on my wave.

87
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,118
How are you?

88
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:42,283
- How are you feeling?
- Erm...

89
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,443
Cool. Powerful.

90
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:47,081
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

91
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,721
Yes, I would like that very much indeed.

92
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:53,123
Anything to put off
actually running the country.

93
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,165
- This is Terence. He's in charge.
- Morning, sir.

94
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:59,801
Good morning.
I had an uncle called Terence.

95
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:03,965
Hated him, I think he was a pervert.
But I very much like the look of you.

96
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:06,077
- This is Pat.
- Hello, Pat.

97
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:08,561
Good morning, sir. I'm the housekeeper.

98
00:08:08,607 --> 00:08:11,121
Oh, right. I should be easier than the last lot.

99
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,920
No nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife.

100
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,720
And this is Natalie. She's new, like you.

101
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:20,362
- Hello, Natalie.
- Hello, David. I mean, sir.

102
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:22,637
Shit, I can't believe I've just said that.

103
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:26,282
And now I've gone and said "shit".
Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.

104
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:29,603
You could've said "fuck"
and we'd have been in real trouble.

105
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:33,322
Thank you, sir. I had a premonition
I was gonna fuck up on my first day.

106
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:37,806
Oh, piss it!

107
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:42,443
Right, I'll get my things
and then let's fix the country, shall we?

108
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:44,318
Yeah, I can't see why not.

109
00:08:56,767 --> 00:08:59,327
- It's all right.
- Did you see what I did?

110
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,358
- Yes, I did.
- I just went "blurh".

111
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,637
- Hello there.
- I'm right over here.

112
00:09:03,687 --> 00:09:06,918
Yeah, I'm in here. OK. Good. Thank you.

113
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,844
Ah.

114
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:10,878
(Clears throat)

115
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:15,042
Oh, no.

116
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,203
That is so inconvenient.

117
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:21,886
In the presence of God,
Peter and Juliet have given their consent

118
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:26,395
and made their marriage vows
to each other.

119
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:29,439
They've declared their marriage
by the giving of rings.

120
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:33,400
I therefore proclaim
that they are husband and wife.

121

(? Organ plays Wedding March)

122
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:41,845
And you resisted
the temptation for surprises.

123
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,957
Yeah, I'm mature now.

124

? Love, love, love

127
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,362
- ? Love, love, love...?
- Did you do this?

128
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:07,319
Er, no.

129
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:11,440
? Love, love, love, love

130
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:16,242
? There's nothing you can do
that can't be done?

131
00:10:16,287 --> 00:10:18,278
Oh, it...

? There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung

? There's nothing you can say
but you can learn how to play the game

134
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:29,357
? It's easy

135
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,876
? All you need is love

00:10:35,087 --> 00:10:37,555
? All you need is love

? All you need is love, love

? Love is all you need...?

Look, it's Pikey.

140
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:04,920
Hello! What the hell are you doing here?

141
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,765
Oh, I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

142
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:10,640
- The lady of the house let you in, did she?
- Yeah.

143
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:13,963
- Lovely, obliging girl.
- Yeah.

144
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,204
I thought I'd pop back and see
if she's better. This is good.

145
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:21,445
- Oh.
- Listen, erm, I've been thinking.

146
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:25,765
I think we ought to take Mum out for
her birthday on Friday. What do you think?

147
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:30,278
- I just feel we've been bad sons this year.
- Sounds fine. A bit boring but fine.

148
00:11:30,327 --> 00:11:32,238
(Girlfriend) Hurry up, big boy!

149
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:36,246
I'm naked and I want you at least twice
before Jamie gets home.

(Juliet) I am so happy to see you!

152
00:11:49,727 --> 00:11:52,400
- Delicious delicacy?
- Er, no, thanks.

153

Taste explosion?

154
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:13,523
- Food?
- No, thanks.

155
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,558
Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?

156
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:19,122
Looks like a dead baby's finger. Oooh.

157
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,522
Oh. Tastes like it, too.

158
00:12:25,007 --> 00:12:27,077
I'm Colin, by the way.

159
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:29,561
- I'm Nancy.
- Wicked.

160
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:31,962
- What do you do, Nancy?
- I'm a cook.

161
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:33,884
- Ever do weddings?
- Yes, I do.

162
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:37,636
- They should've asked you to do this one.
- They did.

163
00:12:37,687 --> 00:12:41,077
- God, I wish you hadn't have turned it down.
- I didn't.

164
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,277
(Embarrassed giggle) Right.

165
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:49,037
- I've worked out why I can't find true love.
- Why is that?

166
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,476
English girls. They're stuck up, you see.

167
00:12:51,527 --> 00:12:56,123
And I am primarily attractive to girls
who are cooler, game for a laugh.

168
00:12:56,167 --> 00:13:00,285
Like American girls.
So I should just go to America!

169
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:03,319
I'd get a girlfriend there instantly.
What do you think?

170
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,562
I think it's crap, Colin.

171
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:07,359
That's where you're wrong.

172
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:10,319
American girls would dig me
with my cute British accent.

173
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:14,360
- You don't have a cute British accent.
- Yes, I do! I'm going to America.

174
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:17,763
Colin, you're a lonely, ugly arsehole.
Accept it.

175
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:22,597
Never. I am Colin, God of Sex.
I'm just on the wrong continent, that's all.

176
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:25,366
Bit of quiet
while we finish the lighting, guys!

177
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:29,923
- The traffic today was just...
- Unbelievable.

178
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,322
Judy, could you take the top off this time?

179
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:36,440
Lighting need to know when we're gonna
see the, erm, nipples and when we're not.

180
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:39,957
Yes, OK. Right.
At least it's nice and warm in here.

181
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:41,406
Not always the case, is it?

182
00:13:41,447 --> 00:13:45,076
I was standing in for Brad Pitt once
on Seven Years In Tibet...

183
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,277
- Yes, yeah.
- Bloody freezing...

184
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,239
Guys, time's tight
and we have to get the actors in.

185
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,357
- Fine.
- I promise I won't look.

186
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:54,284
(Judy laughs)

187
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:59,000
(Director) Right, let's have
another look at that, please.

188
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:11,882
Can you just put your hands on her breasts?

189
00:14:11,927 --> 00:14:14,157
- OK, yeah. Is that all right?
- Yes.

190
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:15,959
I'll warm them up!

191
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,405
- And massage them, please.
- Right.

192
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:31,476
It's junction 13 that's just murder, isn't it?
Total gridlock this morning.

193
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:40,077
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

194
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,436
Some of her requests,

195
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:48,005
for instance, that I should bring
Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral,

196
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:51,756
I was confident she expected me to ignore.

197
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,844
But others she was pretty damn clear about.

198
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:59,244
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen,

199
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,801
I said, "Over my dead body. "

200
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:05,884
And she said, "No, Daniel, over mine. "

201
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:08,964
And as usual, my darling girl...

202
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,837
and Sam's darling mum was right.

203
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:18,917
So she's going to say her final farewell
to you not through me but,

204
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:20,958
inevitably,

205
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,158
ever so coolly,

206
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:28,637
through the immortal genius
of the Bay City Rollers.

207
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:32,836
(On speakers)
? Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

208
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:37,005
? Goodbye baby, baby bye bye

209

? Bye bye baby

210
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:43,836
? Don't make me cry
? Goodbye baby, baby bye bye

211
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:47,675
? You're the one girl in town I'd marry

212
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:52,847
? Girl I'd marry you now if I were free

213
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:57,802
? I wish it could be

214
00:15:57,847 --> 00:16:01,635
? I could love you but why begin it?

215
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:04,645
? Cos there ain't any future in it

216
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:08,123
? She's got me but I'm not free so...?

217
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:11,760
(From DJ booth)
? Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

? Bye bye baby, don't make me cry

220
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:23,006
? Goodbye baby, baby bye bye

221
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:24,799
? Wish I never had known you...?

222
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:27,315
Do you love him?

223
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,358
Er, er, what?

224
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:33,036
No, I-I just thought I'd ask bluntly
in case it was the right question

225
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:37,797
and you needed someone to talk to about it
and no one had ever asked you.

226
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:42,477
No. No. No is the answer. Absolutely not.

227
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:44,438
?... on my finger...?

228
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:46,318
So that's a no, then?

229
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:48,437
Yes. Erm...

230
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:50,876
? Bye bye baby, baby goodbye

231
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,918
? Goodbye baby, baby bye bye...?

232
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:55,765
This DJ, what do you reckon?

233
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,605
- The worst in history?
- Probably.

234
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:01,002
I think it all hangs on the next song.

235
00:17:01,047 --> 00:17:03,003
Now here's one for the lovers.

236
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:06,926
That's quite a few of you,
I shouldn't be surprised and a half.

237
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,117
(? S Club Juniors: Puppy Love)

238
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,757
? And they called it...?

239
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:17,756
- He's done it, it's official.
- Worst DJ in the world.

240
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:21,800
? Oh, I guess they'll never know...?

241

(Knocks)

242
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:26,804
Sarah's waiting for you.

243
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,281
Oh, yes, of course, erm...

244
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,197
Great, er, good, good.

245
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:37,286
How are you doing, Mia?
Settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?

246
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:38,999
Absolutely.

247
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:42,959
- Harry?
- Sarah,

248
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:49,845
switch off your phone and tell me exactly
how long it is that you've been working here.

249
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:55,320
Two years, seven months,

250
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,961
three days and, I suppose, what, two hours?

251
00:17:58,007 --> 00:18:02,842
And how long have you been in love
with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?

252
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:05,838
Um...

253
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:13,437
Two years, seven months, three days
and, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes.

254
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:15,125
Thought as much.

255
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,158
- Do you think everybody knows?
- Yes.

256
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:19,402
- Do you think Karl knows?
- Yes.

257
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:23,325
Oh, that is... that is bad news.

258
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:28,600
I just thought that maybe the time
had come to do something about it.

259
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,996
- Like what?
- Invite him out for a drink

260
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:36,723
then casually mention you'd like to marry
him and have lots of sex and babies.

261
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,042
- You know that?
- Yes.

262
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:42,402
And so does Karl.

263
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:44,836
Think about it, for all our sakes.

264
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:47,355
It's Christmas.

265
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,117
Certainly. Excellent. Will do.

266
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,283
Thanks, boss.

267
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,002
- Hi, Sarah.
- Hi, Karl.

268
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:04,122
(? On radio: Christmas Is All Around)

Babe. Absolutely, fire away.

Mia, Mia, would you turn that down?

272
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:18,199
What is that?

273
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:21,717
That was the Christmas effort
from the once great Billy Mack.

274
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:24,600
Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen.

275
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:30,085
I can safely say that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

276
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:34,120
Oh, and coincidentally,
I believe Billy will be a guest

277

on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.

Welcome back, Bill.

279
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:41,958
Billy, welcome back to the airwaves.

280
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:45,079
New Christmas single,
cover of Love Is All Around.

281
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:50,247
Except we've changed
the word "love" to "Christmas".

282
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:53,359
Yes, is that an important message
to you, Bill?

283
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:55,796
(Snorts) Not really, Mike.

284
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:59,999
Christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives.

285
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:02,436
- And that's not you?
- That's not me, Michael.

286
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:06,321
When I was young and successful,
I was greedy and foolish

287
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:10,360
and now I'm left with no one,
wrinkled and alone.

288
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:13,046
- Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.
- For what?

289
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,840
For actually giving
a real answer to a question.

290
00:20:15,887 --> 00:20:19,482
It doesn't often happen here
at Radio Watford, I can tell you.

291
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:23,156
- Ask me anything, I'll tell you the truth.
- Best shag you ever had?

292
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:25,846
- Britney Spears.
- Wow.

293
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:28,082
No, only kidding! (Snorts)

294
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:30,436
- She was rubbish.
- OK, here's one.

295
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:34,924
How do you think the new record
compares to your old, classic stuff?

296
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,357
Come on, Mikey, you know as well as I do
the record's crap.

297
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:40,045
(Bill laughing)

298
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:43,397
But wouldn't it be great
if number one this Christmas

299
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:45,677
wasn't some smug teenager

300
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:49,879
but an old ex-heroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price?

301
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:53,317
Those young popsters come Christmas
will be stretched out naked

302
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,961
with a cute bird balancing on their balls

303
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:59,477
and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat
with me manager Joe,

304
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:01,563
ugliest man in the world,

305
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:05,885
fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didn't pay off.

306
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:11,001
So if you believe in Father Christmas,
children, like your Uncle Billy does,

307
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:14,676
buy my festering turd of a record.

308
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:17,639
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

309
00:21:17,687 --> 00:21:21,965
of the moment we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line.

310
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:24,202
I think you're referring to

311
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,477
"If you really love Christmas... "

312
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:29,644
"Come on and let it snow. " Ouch.

313
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:31,678
So, here it is one more time,

314
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:34,924
the dark horse for this year's
Christmas number one,

315
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:39,279
Christmas Is All Around.
Thank you, Billy. After this, the news.

316
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:41,761
Is the new prime minister in trouble already?

317
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:46,726
? I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes?

318
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:50,207
- OK. What's next?
- The President's visit.

319
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:54,206
Ah, yes, yes. I fear this is going to be
a difficult one to play. Alex.

320
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:59,399
There's a strong feeling in the party
we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied

321
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:01,881
- like the last government.
- (All) Here, here.

322
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:05,886
This is our first really important test,
let's take a stand.

323
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:10,443
Right. Right. I understand that
but I have decided...

324
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:13,918
not to. Not this time.

325
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:18,324
Let's not forget that America
is the most powerful country in the world.

326
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:20,801
I'm not going to act like a petulant child.

327
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:26,396
Who do you have to screw round here
to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?

328
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,805
Right.

329
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:36,519
(Knocking)

330
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:38,637
Yeah, come in.

331
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:45,247
- These are from the Treasury...
- Uh-huh.

332
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:48,279
...and these are for you.

333
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,045
Excellent. Thanks a lot.

334
00:22:50,087 --> 00:22:54,126
I was hoping you'd win, not that
I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke,

335
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:57,921
just always given him the boring biscuits
with no chocolate.

336
00:22:57,967 --> 00:22:59,798
Thanks very much. Thanks...

337
00:23:01,367 --> 00:23:03,437
Natalie.

338
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:12,357
God, come on, get a grip.
You're the Prime Minister, for God's sake.

339
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,761
So what do you reckon
to our new prime minister?

340
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:21,198
Oh, I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married, though.

341
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:24,284
You know the type, he's married to his job.

342
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:27,444
Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

343
00:23:27,487 --> 00:23:30,638
Excuse me, Judy, if you could
just lower the nipples

344
00:23:30,687 --> 00:23:33,076
- and cheat them a bit to the left?
- OK.

345
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,721
I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure,

346
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:42,316
it's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

347
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:44,358
- Thank you!
- Oh, well, you know.

348
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:46,079
- And ditto.
- Thank you.

349
00:23:46,127 --> 00:23:48,402
The move again, please, Judy.

350
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:50,881
- Ooh, sorry.
- Oh, God, sorry. You all right?

351
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:56,805
- Exciting news!
- What?

352
00:23:56,847 --> 00:24:00,044
I've bought a ticket to the States.
I'm off in three weeks.

353
00:24:00,087 --> 00:24:01,486
- No.
- Yes!

354
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:05,520
- To a fantastic place called Wisconsin.
- No!

355
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:09,082
Yes! Wisconsin babes,
here comes Sir Colin!

356
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:13,166
No, Col! There are a few babes in America,
I grant you,

357
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:15,880
but they're going out
with rich, attractive guys.

358
00:24:15,927 --> 00:24:19,044
Tone, you're just jealous.

359
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:22,841
You know perfectly well
that any bar anywhere in America

360
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:27,119
contains ten girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

361
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:31,638
- than the whole of the United Kingdom.
- That is total bollocks. You're mad.

362
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:36,442
No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William
without the weird family.

363
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:38,682
- No, Colin, no!
- Yes!

364
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,876
- Nyet!
- Da!

365
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:41,246
- Nein!
- Ja, darling!

366
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:44,882
Right, the Christmas party,
not my favourite night of the year

367
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:47,202
and your unhappy job to organise.

368
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:50,125
- Tell me.
- It's basic, really.

369
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:53,842
Find a venue, over-order on the drinks,
bulk buy the guacamole

370
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:57,766
and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

371
00:24:57,807 --> 00:25:02,119
- Wives and family and stuff?
- Yeah. I mean, not children.

372
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,637
But their wives and girlfriends, et cetera.

373
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:11,205
Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible
six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend?

374
00:25:11,247 --> 00:25:15,843
No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe,
hoping to be kissed.

375
00:25:17,127 --> 00:25:19,766
Really?

376
00:25:19,807 --> 00:25:21,798
Right.

377
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:34,476
He now spends all the time in his room.
I mean, he'll be up there now.

378
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:38,076
- That's not unusual. My horrid son...
- Bernard?

379
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:42,484
Bernard. Stays in his room all the time.
Thank goodness.

380
00:25:42,527 --> 00:25:45,246
Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time.

381
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:50,640
I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong, you know?

382
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:52,678
I mean, clearly it's about his mum

383
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:57,676
but Christ, he might be injecting heroin
into his eyeballs for all I know.

384
00:25:57,727 --> 00:25:59,445
(Karen) At the age of 11?

385
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:03,560
(Daniel) Well, maybe not his eyeballs, then.
Maybe just his veins.

386
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:07,805
The problem is his mum
always used to talk to him, you know, and...

387
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:14,567
I don't know, this whole stepfather thing
seems suddenly to somehow matter

388
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,802
like it never did before.

389
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:21,477
Listen, it was always going to be
a totally shit time.

390
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:23,995
Just be patient.

391
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:26,322
And maybe check the room for needles.

392
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:31,157
And then when he sometimes does
come out, it's obvious he's been crying.

393
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:43,357
It's just such a ridiculous waste.

394
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:46,524
And now if it's going to ruin
Sam's life as well...

395
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:50,520
I just don't know.

396
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,161
Get a grip.

397
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:55,323
People hate sissies.

398
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:58,518
No one's ever gonna shag you
if you cry all the time.

399
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:01,400
Yeah. Absolutely.

400
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:03,438
Helpful.

401
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:14,516
So, what's the problem, Samuel?

402
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:20,957
Is it just Mum or is it something else, huh?

403
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:24,357
Maybe school?

404
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:27,364
Are you being bullied?

405
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:30,523
Or is it something worse?

406
00:27:32,247 --> 00:27:34,477
Can you give me any clues at all?

407
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:39,084
- You really want to know?
- I really want to know.

408
00:27:39,127 --> 00:27:41,595
Even though you won't be able to help?

409
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:44,161
Even if that's the case, yeah.

410
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:48,442
OK. Well...

411
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:52,240
truth is, actually...

412
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:55,078
I'm in love.

413
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:56,685
Sorry?

414
00:27:56,727 --> 00:28:01,118
I know I should be thinking
about Mum and I am but I'm in love.

415
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:05,285
I was before she died
and there's nothing I can do about it.

416
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:09,240
- Aren't you a bit young to be in love?
- No.

417
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,199
Ah, well. OK, well...

418
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:16,401
I'm a little relieved.

419
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:19,517
- Why?
- Because I...

420
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:21,637
thought it'd be something worse.

421
00:28:21,687 --> 00:28:24,599
Worse than the total agony of being in love?

422
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:27,207
Er...

423
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,841
No, you're right.

424
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:31,957
Total agony.

425
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:09,603
- Night, Sarah.
- Night, Karl.

426
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:15,878
(Mobile)

427
00:29:19,087 --> 00:29:21,078
Yeah, absolutely.

428
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,277
Free as a bird. Fire away.

429
00:29:54,487 --> 00:29:56,557
Alone again.

430
00:29:57,767 --> 00:29:59,405
Naturally.

431
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:01,517
- I'll deal with it.
- Mm.

432
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:06,003
- Ah. Natalie.
- Sir.

433
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:09,445
Thanks.

434
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:11,478
Natalie.

435
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,326
Erm, I'm starting to feel...

436
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:21,042
uncomfortable about us
working so closely every day

437
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:25,478
and me knowing so little about you,
it seems elitist and wrong.

438
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:28,279
Well, there's not much to know.

439
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,717
Well, erm, where do you live, for instance?

440
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:33,883
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

441
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:37,158
- Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth.
- Oh.

442
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,835
So which exactly is the dodgy end?

443
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:44,357
At the end of the high street,
Harris Street, near the Queen's Head.

444
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,160
- Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.
- Hm.

445
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:51,325
Erm, and you live
with your husband? Boyfriend?

446
00:30:52,527 --> 00:30:55,405
- Three illegitimate but charming children?
- No.

447
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:59,918
I've just split up with my boyfriend, so
I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.

448
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:04,119
- Ah. Sorry.
- No, it's fine.

449
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,522
I'm well shot of him.

450
00:31:06,567 --> 00:31:09,286
- He said I was getting fat.
- I beg your pardon?

451
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:13,115
He said no one'd fancy a girl
with thighs the size of tree trunks.

452
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,681
Not a nice guy, actually, in the end.

453
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,958
No.

454
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:27,803
You know, erm...

455
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:31,604
being Prime Minister,
I could just have him murdered.

456
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:35,036
Thank you, sir. I'll think about it.

457
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:38,875
Do. The SAS are absolutely charming.

458
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:42,761
Ruthless, trained killers
are just a phone call away.

459
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,198
Oh, God.

460
00:31:52,727 --> 00:31:55,002
Did you have this kind of problem?

461
00:31:57,327 --> 00:31:59,841
Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx.

462
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:03,197
So, let's go. We can definitely crack this.

463
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:05,397
Remember, I was a kid once, too.

464
00:32:05,447 --> 00:32:09,679
So, come on, it's someone at school. Right?

465
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,558
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Good, good.

466
00:32:11,607 --> 00:32:14,599
And what does she, he, feel about you?

467
00:32:14,647 --> 00:32:17,480
SHE doesn't even know my name.

468
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:20,246
And even if she did, she'd despise me.

469
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:22,562
She's the coolest girl in school.

470
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,566
And everyone worships her
because she's heaven.

471
00:32:26,607 --> 00:32:29,041
Good. Good.

472
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,317
Well,

473
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,961
basically you're fucked, aren't you?

474
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,357
(? All I Want For Christmas Is You)

475
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,316
Hi there and welcome back.

476
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:47,519
So, three weeks till Christmas, looks like
the real competition is gonna be Blue.

477
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:51,924
I saw them on the show last week.
They weren't very nice about my record.

478
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:54,276
No. Little scamps.

479
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:57,637
But very, very talented musicians.

480
00:32:57,687 --> 00:33:01,805
Yeah. I understand you've got a prize
for our competition winners.

481
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,280
Yes, I have, Ant or Dec.

482
00:33:03,327 --> 00:33:07,206
It's a personalised felt-tip pen.

483
00:33:07,247 --> 00:33:08,839
Oh, great.

484
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:12,516
It's brilliant. It even writes on glass,

485
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:17,163
so if you've got a framed picture,
like, for instance, this one of Blue,

486
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:19,198
you can just write on it.

487
00:33:30,767 --> 00:33:32,325
(Kids snickering)

488
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:36,121
(Dec) Er, a lot of kids watching, Billy.
(Billy) Oh, yeah.

489
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,920
Hiya, kids.

490
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:42,243
Here's an important message
from your Uncle Bill -

491
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,357
don't buy drugs.

492
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:49,205
Become a pop star
and they give you them for free.

493
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:53,877
And I do believe it's a commercial break.
We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.

494
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:58,557
? All I want for Christmas is you?

495
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:09,480
- Look at him! Eurh!
- Just a minute.

496
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:11,995
Actually, they're not funny. They're art.

497
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:15,283
(Laughing)

498
00:34:16,327 --> 00:34:18,966
OK, let's say, er, Thursday, my place.

499
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:23,205
Great. I've got Juliet on the other line,
she wants to ask you a favour.

500
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:28,037
- (Sighing) OK, fine.
- Thanks and, er, be nice.

501
00:34:28,087 --> 00:34:33,002
- I'm always nice.
- 'You know what I mean, Marky, be friendly. '

502
00:34:33,047 --> 00:34:35,322
- I'm always...
- (Juliet) 'Mark? '

503
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:38,200
Hi. How was the honeymoon?

504
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:40,920
It was great.
Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff.

505
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:44,437
- So, what can I do for you?
- 'Lt's only a tiny favour. '

506
00:34:44,487 --> 00:34:47,365
I've just tried the wedding video
and it's a disaster.

507
00:34:47,407 --> 00:34:50,365
- 'Lt's come out all blue and wibbly. '
- I'm sorry.

508
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:53,956
I remember you filming a lot
and I wondered if I could look at it.

509
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:56,043
To be honest, I didn't really...

510
00:34:56,087 --> 00:35:00,603
Please. All I want is one shot of me
in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise.

511
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:05,402
I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure I wiped it,
so don't get any hopes up.

512
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:08,200
- 'Must go. '
- (Click)

513
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:15,366
Any progress with our matchmaking plans?

514
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:19,195
No. I've done fuck-all and never will
because he's too good for me.

515
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,238
How true.

516
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:24,598
- (Sarah) Stop.
- (Mobile)

517
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:26,797
And of course, your mobile goes.

518
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:30,327
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

519
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:34,165
- So, how's the Christmas party going?
- Good.

520
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:36,323
Think I've found a venue.

521
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,643
- What's it like?
- Good. Good.

522
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:44,602
It's an art gallery. Full of dark corners
for doing dark deeds.

523
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:49,598
Oh. Right.

524
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,686
Good. Well, I suppose I should
take a look at it or something.

525
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:55,763
You should.

526
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:05,198
(Typewriter clacking)

527
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:07,958
(Bell tinkles)

528
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,560
Ah, bonjour, Eleonore.

529
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:18,360
Bonjour, Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back.

530
00:36:18,407 --> 00:36:20,443
And this year you bring a lady guest?

531
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:23,604
No. There's a change of situation. Just me.

532
00:36:23,647 --> 00:36:27,925
- Oh. Am I sad or not sad?
- I think you're not surprised.

533
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:30,606
- And you stay here till Christmas?
- Yeah, yeah.

534
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:35,675
Good. Well, I find you
a perfect lady to clean the house.

535
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:38,195
This is Aurelia.

536
00:36:38,247 --> 00:36:40,124
Ah.

537
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:44,080
- Er, bonjour, Aurelia.
- Bonjour.

538
00:36:44,127 --> 00:36:49,076
(French) Er, je suis, er, très heureux
de vous avoir ici.

539
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:54,005
Unfortunately, she cannot speak French,
just like you.

540
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,924
She's Portuguese.

541
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,481
(Italian) Ah, ah, buongiorno.

542
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:00,404
Eusebio, er, er...

543
00:37:00,447 --> 00:37:02,756
(Pidgin Spanish) Er, molto bueno...

544
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:08,802
I think she's ten years too young
to remember a footballer called Eusebio.

545
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:11,156
And "molto bueno" is Spanish.

546
00:37:11,207 --> 00:37:12,686
Right.

547
00:37:12,727 --> 00:37:15,400
Anyway, it's nice to meet you and...

548
00:37:15,927 --> 00:37:18,077
Can you drive her home after her work?

549
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:21,802
Oh, absolutely, yes.
Con-Con grande, er, pl-plesura.

550
00:37:21,847 --> 00:37:23,997
Which is what? Turkish?

551
00:37:31,407 --> 00:37:33,398
(Pidgin Portuguese) Bello.

552
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:36,958
Er, bella.

553
00:37:38,087 --> 00:37:40,362
Er, mon-montagno,

554
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:42,398
arvarez...

555
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:47,675
No, right. Silence is golden.

556
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:51,763
As the Tremeloes said.

557
00:37:53,527 --> 00:37:55,165
Clever guys,

558
00:37:55,207 --> 00:38:00,281
although I think the original version was
by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons.

559
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:02,238
Gr-great band.

560
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:04,721
(? High-pitched humming:
Silence Is Golden)

561
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,076
Oh, shut up.

562
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:09,402
(Cheering)

563
00:38:17,447 --> 00:38:19,563
(Press) Mr President!

564
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:23,886
- Over here, sir!
- What will you be talking about?

565
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:26,885
Mr President, welcome.

566
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:28,485
It's a pleasure to meet you.

567
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:31,246
Come through.
I'm sorry your wife couldn't make it.

568
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:34,438
So is she. Although she would have been
kind of lonely.

569
00:38:34,487 --> 00:38:36,478
Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?

570
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,916
Just never been able to tie a girl down.

571
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:41,527
Not sure that politics and dating go together.

572
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:44,445
Really? I've never found that.

573
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:48,765
Yeah, you're still sickeningly handsome,
whereas I look like my Aunt Mildred.

574
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:53,323
- Very jealous of your plane, by the way.
- Thank you. We love that thing.

575
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:55,562
Ah, Natalie. Hi.

576
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:58,246
Morning, ma'am. How's your day so far?

577
00:38:58,287 --> 00:39:00,881
- (Natalie giggles)
- Excellent.

578
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:07,036
(Sighs) My goodness,
that's a pretty little son of a bitch.

579
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:09,078
Did you see those pipes?

580
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:12,199
Yeah, she's terrific. At her job.

581
00:39:12,247 --> 00:39:16,763
No, absolutely not. We cannot
and will not consult on that either.

582
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:18,638
That is unexpected.

583
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:21,076
Well, it shouldn't be.

584
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:24,199
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

585
00:39:24,247 --> 00:39:27,000
We're being consistent with their policies.

586
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:29,800
With all respect, they were bad policies.

587
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:32,964
Thanks, Alex. I don't think
we're making progress here.

588
00:39:33,007 --> 00:39:36,761
Let's, erm... move on, shall we?

589
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:42,443
Well, now, that was an interesting day.

590
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:47,846
Sorry if our line was firm but there's
no point in tiptoeing around today,

591
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:50,560
then just disappointing you for four years.

592
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:53,440
I have plans and I plan to see them through.

593
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:56,445
Absolutely.
There is one final thing to look at.

594
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:59,604
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

595
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,161
I'll give you anything you ask for.

596
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:05,199
As long as it's not something
I don't wanna give.

597
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:11,365
Hi.

598
00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:13,398
Pathetic.

599
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:36,603
It's great Scotch.

600
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:40,435
I'll, erm... I'll be going, then.

601
00:40:41,847 --> 00:40:44,077
Er, Natalie,

602
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:48,882
I hope to see much more of you
as our countries work toward a better future.

603
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:51,316
Thank you, sir.

604
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:08,804
Er, yes, Peter.

605
00:41:08,847 --> 00:41:11,042
Mr President, has it been a good visit?

606
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:14,523
Very satisfactory indeed.

607
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:17,127
We got what we came for

608
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:20,557
and our special relationship
is still very special.

609
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:23,041
Prime Minister?

610
00:41:23,087 --> 00:41:27,444
I love that word "relationship".
Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?

611
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,877
I fear that this has become
a bad relationship.

612
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:35,966
A relationship based on
the President taking what he wants

613
00:41:36,007 --> 00:41:40,842
and casually ignoring all those things
that really matter to, erm...

614
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,358
Britain.

615
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:49,400
We may be a small country
but we're a great one, too.

616
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:52,564
The country of Shakespeare,
Churchill, the Beatles,

617
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:55,724
- Sean Connery, Harry Potter.
- (Laughter)

618
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:58,645
- David Beckham's right foot.
- (Laughter)

619
00:41:58,687 --> 00:42:01,281
David Beckham's left foot, come to that.

620
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:05,206
And a friend who bullies us
is no longer a friend.

621
00:42:05,247 --> 00:42:08,364
And since bullies only respond to strength,
from now onward,

622
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:12,002
I will be prepared to be much stronger.

623
00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:15,198
And the President
should be prepared for that.

624
00:42:15,247 --> 00:42:17,966
(Press clamouring)

625
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:26,638
Mr President!

626
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:31,795
Joe.

627
00:42:32,807 --> 00:42:34,957
It's your sister on line four.

628
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:40,638
All right. Er, yes, I'm very busy
and important, how can I help you?

629
00:42:40,687 --> 00:42:42,757
Have you gone completely insane?

630
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:46,402
- You can't always be sensible.
- 'You can if you're Prime Minister. '

631
00:42:46,447 --> 00:42:49,120
- It's the Chancellor on the other line.
- It isn't!

632
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,840
- 'I'll call you back. '
- No, you won't!

633
00:42:53,647 --> 00:42:59,324
The trouble with being the Prime Minister's
sister is it puts your life into perspective.

634
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:02,359
What did my brother do today?
He fought for his country.

635
00:43:02,407 --> 00:43:06,798
What did I do?
I made a papier-mâché lobster head.

636
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:09,315
What is this we're listening to?

637
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:11,562
Joni Mitchell.

638
00:43:11,607 --> 00:43:14,360
I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.

639
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:17,843
I love her and true love lasts a lifetime.

640
00:43:19,207 --> 00:43:24,076
Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught
your cold English wife how to feel.

641
00:43:24,127 --> 00:43:28,166
Did she? Oh, well, that's good,
I must write to her and say thanks.

642
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:31,682
Which doll for Daisy's friend Emily?

643
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:35,766
The one that looks like a transvestite
or the one that looks like a dominatrix?

644
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:40,277
(Female DJ) 'It's almost enough
to make you feel patriotic,

645
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:43,842
'so here's one
for our arse-kicking prime minister.

646
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,481
'A golden oldie for a golden oldie. '

647

(? Pointer Sisters: Jump)
? Hold me

648
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,526
? I'll give you all that you need

649
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:55,525
? Wrap your love around me

650
00:43:55,567 --> 00:43:59,116
? You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter

651
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:00,805
? Oh baby

652
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:05,284
? I'll take you down, I'll take you down

653
00:44:05,327 --> 00:44:07,602
? Where no one's ever gone before

654
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:09,444
? And if you want more

655
00:44:09,487 --> 00:44:14,117
? If you want more, more, more

656
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:16,840
? Jump for my love

657
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,718
? Jump in

658
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:20,485
? And feel my touch

659
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:24,520
? Jump, if you wanna taste
my kisses in the night then

660
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:27,127
? Jump for my love

661
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:32,565
? I'll take you down, I'll take you down

662
00:44:32,607 --> 00:44:34,040
? Where no one's ever gone?

663
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:35,918
- (Music stops)
- Yeah, erm,

664
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:40,916
Mary, can we move the Japanese
ambassador to four o'clock tomorrow?

665
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:44,357
- Certainly, sir.
- Terrific. Thanks so much.

666
00:44:51,447 --> 00:44:54,086
Erm. Would you like the last, er?

667
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:56,357
(Portuguese) Thank you very much but no.

668
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:58,477
If you saw my sister, you'd understand why.

669
00:44:58,527 --> 00:45:00,563
That's all right, more for me.

670
00:45:00,607 --> 00:45:02,723
(Portuguese)
Just don't go eating it all yourself,

671
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,246
you're getting chubbier every day.

672
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:08,599
I'm very lucky I've got a constitution
where I never put on weight.

673
00:45:08,647 --> 00:45:10,683
(Phone)

674
00:45:10,727 --> 00:45:14,242
- Hello.
- (Ringing continues)

675
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:23,156
Oop. Sorry.

676
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:25,277
(Ringing continues)

677
00:45:26,487 --> 00:45:28,045
Hello?

678
00:45:43,327 --> 00:45:45,795
- Thank you.
- (Portuguese) Não!

679
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:48,919
- Eu peço imensa desculpa.
- Oh, no. Hold on.

680
00:45:48,967 --> 00:45:51,435
- God, it's half the book. Oh, no.
- Que desastre.

681
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,877
Just leave them, please!
They're not important.

682
00:45:54,927 --> 00:45:57,521
They're not worth it!

683
00:45:57,567 --> 00:46:00,400
Stop! Stop.

684
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,961
Aa-ahh.

685
00:46:04,087 --> 00:46:06,203
It's all just rubbish.

686
00:46:07,767 --> 00:46:09,837
Just leave it.

687
00:46:21,247 --> 00:46:24,364
Oh, God, she's in.

688
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:28,082
And now she'll think I'm a total spaz
if I don't go in too.

689
00:46:29,127 --> 00:46:31,436
(Portuguese) Fuck - it's cold!

690
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:37,082
Fuck - it's freezing! Fuck!

691
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,324
(Portuguese) This stuff better be good.

692
00:46:40,887 --> 00:46:43,720
It's not worth it,
this isn't bloody Shakespeare.

693
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,564
(Portuguese) I don't want to drown

694
00:46:45,607 --> 00:46:48,280
saving some shit my grandmother
could have written.

695
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:49,726
Just stop. Stop.

696
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:52,406
(Portuguese) What kind of idiot
doesn't make copies?

697
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:54,284
I really must do copies.

698
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:57,723
There'd better not be eels in here.

699
00:46:57,767 --> 00:47:00,759
(Portuguese) Try not to disturb the eels.

700
00:47:00,807 --> 00:47:02,718
Oh, what the hell is that?

701
00:47:12,527 --> 00:47:14,757
Thank you. Thank you so much.

702
00:47:18,967 --> 00:47:22,357
I know. I'll name
one of the characters after you.

703
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:26,764
(Portuguese) Maybe you could name
one of the characters after me.

704
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:29,844
Or give me 50º/o of the profits.

705
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:32,959
Or I could give you 5º/o of the profits.

706
00:47:35,847 --> 00:47:38,520
(Portuguese) What kind of book is it?

707
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:49,003
- Romance?
- Yes.

708
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:51,925
It's, erm...
(Imitates horror film sound effects)

709
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:53,161
Ah, er...

710
00:47:53,207 --> 00:47:55,357
(Portuguese) Thriller... crime...

711
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:59,241
(Portuguese) Sim.
(English) Crime. Crime, murder.

712
00:47:59,287 --> 00:48:00,959
(Portuguese) Frightening? (Gasps)

713
00:48:01,007 --> 00:48:03,999
Er, scary? Yes, sometimes scary.

714
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:08,325
And, er, sometimes not.
Mainly scary how bad the writing is.

715
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:19,522
Mm.

716
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:25,002
(Portuguese) I'd better get back to work.

717
00:48:25,047 --> 00:48:28,676
- Ah.
- (Portuguese) Later you'll drive me home?

718
00:48:28,727 --> 00:48:30,718
Sure.

719
00:48:33,887 --> 00:48:36,765
It's my favourite time of day...

720
00:48:36,807 --> 00:48:38,798
driving you.

721
00:48:40,967 --> 00:48:45,324
(Portuguese) It's the saddest part
of my day, leaving you.

722
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,406
Sorry.

723
00:49:18,687 --> 00:49:22,043
(TV) 'And coming up
later this morning, it's this guy... '

724
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:26,319
? There's no beginning, there'll be no end

725
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:29,996
- ? Cos on Christmas...
- '... the bad grandad of rock'n'roll,

'here at 10:30. Do not switch off. '

727
00:49:38,247 --> 00:49:40,078
Banoffee pie?

728
00:49:40,127 --> 00:49:41,845
No, thanks.

729
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:45,243
Thank God. You would've broken my heart
if you'd said yes.

730
00:49:45,287 --> 00:49:48,643
Right, well, lucky you.

731
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:52,441
- Can I come in?
- Er, yeah, well, I'm a bit busy...

732
00:49:52,487 --> 00:49:57,197
I was just passing and I thought
we might check that video thing out.

733
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,080
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie

734
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,322
or maybe Munchies?

735
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:06,599
Actually, I was serious - I don't know
where it is. I'll have a look tonight.

736
00:50:06,647 --> 00:50:09,480
Mark, can I say something?

737
00:50:09,527 --> 00:50:11,518
Yeah.

738
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:14,961
I know you're Peter's best friend

739
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:19,956
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

740
00:50:20,007 --> 00:50:22,805
Look, don't, don't argue.

741
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:25,156
We've never got friendly.

742
00:50:25,207 --> 00:50:27,641
But I wanted to say, I hope that can change.

743
00:50:27,687 --> 00:50:31,600
I'm nice. I really am.
Apart from my terrible taste in pie and...

744
00:50:32,887 --> 00:50:35,401
It would be great if we could be friends.

745
00:50:36,007 --> 00:50:37,998
Absolutely. Absolutely.

746
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:43,756
Great.

747
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:46,685
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video, though.

748
00:50:46,727 --> 00:50:50,436
I had a real search when you first called
and couldn't find it so...

749
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:53,320
This one says
"Peter and Juliet's Wedding".

750
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:55,597
Do you think we might be on the right track?

751
00:50:55,647 --> 00:51:00,038
Er, yeah, well... Wow. That-that could be it.

752
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:02,726
- Do you mind if I?
- I've probably taped over it.

753
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:05,759
Almost everything's episodes of West Wing.

754
00:51:06,807 --> 00:51:08,798
Oh.

755
00:51:10,327 --> 00:51:12,363
Oh, bingo.

756
00:51:13,927 --> 00:51:15,963
That's lovely.

757
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:18,077
Well done, you.

758
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,517
Oh, that's gorgeous.

759
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:26,846
Thank you so much, Mark,
this is exactly what I was hoping for.

760
00:51:33,527 --> 00:51:35,722
I look quite pretty.

761
00:51:42,687 --> 00:51:44,757
You've stayed rather close.

762
00:52:36,647 --> 00:52:38,842
They're all of me.

763
00:52:42,727 --> 00:52:45,764
(Mark) Yeah. Yeah.

764
00:52:45,807 --> 00:52:47,798
Yes.

765
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:18,638
But...

766
00:53:19,687 --> 00:53:21,803
you never talk to me.

767
00:53:24,087 --> 00:53:26,078
You always talk to Peter.

768
00:53:28,527 --> 00:53:30,643
You don't like me.

769
00:53:31,807 --> 00:53:33,798
I hope it's useful.

770
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:36,805
Don't show it around too much.

771
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:39,919
Needs a bit of editing.

772
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:43,516
Look, I've got to get to a... lunch.

773
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:45,444
Early lunch.

774
00:53:45,487 --> 00:53:48,320
You can just show yourself out, can't you?

775
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:57,965

01:05:35,647 --> 01:05:37,763
Well, then. I'd better go.

938
01:05:37,807 --> 01:05:39,798
OK.

939
01:05:41,087 --> 01:05:43,237
- Good night.
- Good night.

940
01:05:59,687 --> 01:06:01,678
Actually...

941
01:06:01,727 --> 01:06:03,957
- I don't have to go.
- Right. Good.

942
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:06,043
- I mean...
- No, that's good.

943
01:06:07,007 --> 01:06:10,443
Just, erm, would you excuse me
for one second?

944
01:06:10,487 --> 01:06:13,081
- Sure.
- Just one second.

945
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:23,443
Erm, OK, that's done. Erm...

946
01:06:24,967 --> 01:06:28,357
Why don't you come upstairs
in about ten seconds?

947
01:06:28,407 --> 01:06:30,602
- Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds.

950
01:06:59,647 --> 01:07:04,277
? There'll be no crying

951
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:12,323
? For you

954
01:07:24,887 --> 01:07:28,562
? It's all right...?

955
01:07:28,607 --> 01:07:30,996
- Just tug it.
- OK.

956
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:36,201

957
01:07:36,247 --> 01:07:39,683
? And the songbirds

01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:48,317
? Keep singing like they know the score

959
01:07:48,367 --> 01:07:51,518
? And I love you, I love you, I love you...?

960
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,206
You're beautiful.

963
01:08:16,527 --> 01:08:18,722
L- I'd better answer that.

964
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:25,879
Hello. Hi. Hello, darling.

965
01:08:25,927 --> 01:08:28,805
No, no, I'm not busy. No, fire away.

966
01:08:29,847 --> 01:08:31,644
Right.

967
01:08:31,687 --> 01:08:35,566
Yes, I... I'm not quite sure
it's gonna be possible

968
01:08:35,607 --> 01:08:38,246
to get the Pope on the phone tonight but...

969
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:44,645
Yes. Yes, I'm sure he's very good
at exorcism but...

970
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:50,356
Well, I'm sure...

971
01:08:50,407 --> 01:08:54,082
Jon Bon Jovi is as well
and I'll definitely look into it.

972
01:08:54,127 --> 01:08:57,563
OK? OK, I'll talk to you later.

973
01:08:57,607 --> 01:08:59,598
All right, bye-bye.

974
01:09:04,767 --> 01:09:08,521
- Sorry about that.
- No, it's fine.

975
01:09:08,567 --> 01:09:11,445
It's my brother, he's not well, he calls a lot.

976
01:09:13,327 --> 01:09:15,716
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

977
01:09:15,767 --> 01:09:18,998
I mean, it's not really fine, it is what it is,

978
01:09:19,047 --> 01:09:22,562
and there being no parents now
and us being over here,

979
01:09:22,607 --> 01:09:27,806
it's my job to keep an eye on him.
Not my job, obviously, I'm glad to do it...

980
01:09:27,847 --> 01:09:32,477
That's OK. Life is full
of interruptions and complications.

981
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:36,480
So...

982
01:09:47,887 --> 01:09:49,878
(Mobile)

983
01:09:52,727 --> 01:09:54,718
Will it make him better?

984
01:09:56,047 --> 01:09:57,765
No.

985
01:09:57,807 --> 01:09:59,798
Then maybe...

986
01:10:00,527 --> 01:10:02,518
don't answer.

987
01:10:09,687 --> 01:10:12,155
Hey. How you doing?

988
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:15,725
Right, right. Oh, no, please.

989
01:10:15,767 --> 01:10:18,918
Oh, please, please don't, little darling.

990
01:10:18,967 --> 01:10:23,563
Between the two of us we'll find the answer
and it won't hurt any more.

991
01:10:23,607 --> 01:10:25,518
No, no.

992
01:10:25,567 --> 01:10:27,558
I'm-I'm not busy. I...

993
01:10:29,127 --> 01:10:32,324
Of course, if you want me
to come over I will. Mm-hm.

994
01:10:33,967 --> 01:10:35,764
OK.

995
01:10:44,367 --> 01:10:47,120
That was a good night.

996
01:10:47,167 --> 01:10:49,761
- Except I felt fat.
- Don't be ridiculous.

997
01:10:49,807 --> 01:10:51,399
It's true.

998
01:10:51,447 --> 01:10:55,486
Nowadays the only clothes I can get into
were once owned by Pavarotti.

999
01:10:55,527 --> 01:10:58,325
I always think Pavarotti dresses very well.

1000
01:11:01,727 --> 01:11:03,718
Mia's very pretty.

1001
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:07,518
Is she?

1002
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:11,759
You know she is, darling.

1003
01:11:11,807 --> 01:11:13,923
Be careful there.

1004
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:38,880
Have you been watching stuff on TV?

1005
01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:42,635
Yeah.

1006
01:11:42,687 --> 01:11:44,598
- Every night.
- Good.

1007
01:11:44,647 --> 01:11:46,717
And every day.

1008
01:11:53,367 --> 01:11:58,122
- The nurses are trying to kill me.
- Nobody's trying to kill you, babe.

1009
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:05,958
Thank you.

1010
01:12:08,567 --> 01:12:10,956
Don't do that, my darling.

1011
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:15,158
Thank you.

1012
01:12:21,927 --> 01:12:23,997
Don't do that.

1013
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:50,005
(Dog barking in distance)

1014
01:12:55,327 --> 01:12:59,639
Right. Back at three. Christmas shopping,
never easy or pleasant.

1015
01:12:59,687 --> 01:13:02,485
Are you gonna get me something?

1016
01:13:02,527 --> 01:13:04,518
Er...

1017
01:13:05,967 --> 01:13:07,958
I don't know, I hadn't thought.

1018
01:13:08,007 --> 01:13:09,804
Where's Sarah, by the way?

1019
01:13:09,847 --> 01:13:12,520
She couldn't make it in. Family thing.

1020
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:16,162
There's a word for hangover
I've never heard before.

1021
01:13:16,207 --> 01:13:20,200
- See you later.
- Yes. Looking forward to it.

1022
01:13:23,447 --> 01:13:25,438
A lot.

1023
01:13:37,007 --> 01:13:39,123
Are you gonna give me something?

1024
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:42,726
I thought I made it clear last night.

1025
01:13:42,767 --> 01:13:46,362
When it comes to me,
you can have everything.

1026
01:13:46,407 --> 01:13:49,763
So, erm, what do you need?

1027
01:13:50,967 --> 01:13:54,846
Something along the stationery line?
Are you short of staplers?

1028
01:13:54,887 --> 01:13:58,197
No. I don't want something I need.

1029
01:13:58,247 --> 01:14:01,557
I want something I want. Something pretty.

1030
01:14:02,687 --> 01:14:04,518
Right.

1031
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:07,558
Right.

1032
01:14:14,607 --> 01:14:18,202
Sorry I'm late, I had to drop off
Bernie at rehearsal.

1033
01:14:21,927 --> 01:14:24,487
Right, listen, you keep yourself occupied

1034
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:27,564
while I do the boring stuff for our mothers.

1035
01:14:48,607 --> 01:14:50,677
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1036
01:14:50,727 --> 01:14:53,366
Looking for anything in particular, sir?

1037
01:14:53,407 --> 01:14:56,922
Yes. That necklace there, how much is it?

1038
01:14:56,967 --> 01:14:59,083
It's £270.

1039
01:15:00,367 --> 01:15:04,326
- Erm, all right. Er, I'll have it.
- Lovely.

1040
01:15:07,207 --> 01:15:10,199
Would you like it... giftwrapped?

1041
01:15:10,247 --> 01:15:12,920
- Yes, all right.
- Lovely.

1042
01:15:15,887 --> 01:15:18,037
Let me just pop it in the box.

1043
01:15:19,647 --> 01:15:21,046
There.

1044
01:15:21,087 --> 01:15:24,557
- Look, could we be quite quick?
- Certainly, sir.

1045
01:15:24,607 --> 01:15:27,360
Ready in the flashiest of flashes.

1046
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:36,119
- There.
- That's great.

1047
01:15:36,167 --> 01:15:38,886
Not quite finished.

1048
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:46,763
- I don't need a bag, I'll put it in my pocket.
- Oh, this isn't a bag, sir.

1049
01:15:46,807 --> 01:15:50,083
- Really?
- This is so much more than a bag.

1050
01:15:56,567 --> 01:15:58,523
Ooh!

1051
01:16:12,327 --> 01:16:14,636
Could we be quite quick, please?

1052
01:16:14,687 --> 01:16:17,360
Prontissimo.

1053
01:16:34,887 --> 01:16:37,526
- What's that?
- A cinnamon stick, sir.

1054
01:16:37,567 --> 01:16:40,957
- Actually, I really can't wait.
- You won't regret it, sir.

1055
01:16:41,007 --> 01:16:43,202
Want to bet?

1056
01:16:43,247 --> 01:16:45,602
'Tis but the work of a moment.

1057
01:16:48,927 --> 01:16:51,122
There we go. Almost finished.

1058
01:16:51,167 --> 01:16:55,479
Are you gonna dip it in yogurt?
Cover it with chocolate buttons?

1059
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:58,519
No, sir, we're going to pop it
in the Christmas box.

1060
01:16:58,567 --> 01:17:00,125
I don't want a Christmas box.

1061
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:02,840
- But you wanted it giftwrapped.
- I did but...

1062
01:17:02,887 --> 01:17:04,605
- The final flourish.
- Can I pay?

1063
01:17:04,647 --> 01:17:07,286
- All we need now...
- Oh, God.

1064
01:17:07,327 --> 01:17:09,443
...is a sprig of holly.
- No, no, no, no.

1065
01:17:09,487 --> 01:17:11,443
- No bloody holly.
- But sir...

1066
01:17:11,487 --> 01:17:14,081
- Leave it.
- Ooh!

1067
01:17:14,127 --> 01:17:17,961
- Loitering around the jewellery section?
- No. I was just looking around.

1068
01:17:18,007 --> 01:17:20,567
Don't worry. My expectations
are not that high

01:17:30,527 --> 01:17:36,443
? Where do the lonely hearts go...?

1074
01:17:36,487 --> 01:17:39,718
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?

1075
01:17:39,767 --> 01:17:42,679
Had to rent out my flat to pay for my ticket.

1076
01:17:42,727 --> 01:17:45,958
You're not actually going ahead
with this stupid plan?

1077
01:17:46,007 --> 01:17:47,679
I bloody am.

1078
01:17:47,727 --> 01:17:50,924
You think this is full of clothes?
Like hell it is.

1079
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:53,925
It is chock-a-block full of condoms.

1080
01:17:53,967 --> 01:17:57,277
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect, keep that going.

1081
01:17:57,327 --> 01:17:59,522
(Clears throat) Look, erm...

1082
01:18:00,807 --> 01:18:03,275
sorry to be a bit forward and all that but...

1083
01:18:03,327 --> 01:18:07,798
you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink,
do you? I mean, nothing implied.

1084
01:18:07,847 --> 01:18:13,240
Just maybe go and see something
Christmassy or something.

1085
01:18:13,287 --> 01:18:16,484
Obviously, if you don't want to,
you don't have to. I...

1086
01:18:16,527 --> 01:18:18,199
I'm rambling now, sorry.

1087
01:18:18,247 --> 01:18:20,841
No. That would be lovely.

Normally, I'm really shy, takes me ages
to get the courage up, so thank you.

1094
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:49,160
We've been waiting for hours,
it's the first ever preview.

1095
01:18:49,207 --> 01:18:51,198
?... is a thing of the past

1096
01:18:51,247 --> 01:18:54,523
? Maybe you can bring us all hope this year

1097
01:18:54,567 --> 01:18:57,445
? Visions of sugarplums
have disappeared...?

1098
01:18:57,487 --> 01:19:01,400
(Karen) It was a starry night
in ancient Jerusalem

1099
01:19:01,447 --> 01:19:04,519
and the baby Jesus was in his manger.

1100
01:19:12,287 --> 01:19:15,836
Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective.

1101
01:19:15,887 --> 01:19:18,799
(Russian) Is this the way to the train station?

1102
01:19:18,847 --> 01:19:21,884
I would like half-pint of churly.

1103
01:19:22,927 --> 01:19:25,521
I would like a one-day Travelcard.

1104
01:19:25,567 --> 01:19:29,196
(Portuguese) Oh, my God,
I've got a terrible stomachache.

1105
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:31,442
It must have been the prawns.

1106
01:19:31,487 --> 01:19:33,921
Milton Keynes has many roundabouts.

1107
01:19:35,047 --> 01:19:39,086
(Portuguese) My goodness,
this is a very big fish!

1108
01:19:39,127 --> 01:19:42,039
It tastes delicious!

1109
01:19:42,087 --> 01:19:43,725
? All alone on Christmas

1110
01:19:43,767 --> 01:19:46,327
? Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas

1111
01:19:46,367 --> 01:19:50,155
? All alone on Christmas
? Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas

1112
01:19:50,207 --> 01:19:51,686
? Tell me I've got to know

1113
01:19:51,727 --> 01:19:56,243
? Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
? Don't leave me alone?

1114
01:19:56,287 --> 01:20:00,883
- You'll come back a broken man.
- Yeah, back broken from too much sex.

1115
01:20:00,927 --> 01:20:03,202
You are on the road to disaster.

1116
01:20:03,247 --> 01:20:06,603
No, I am on shag highway, heading west.

1117
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,078
Farewell, failure.

1118
01:20:09,127 --> 01:20:12,915
America, watch out!
Here comes Colin Frissell.

1119
01:20:12,967 --> 01:20:16,403
? And he's got a big knob?

1120
01:20:17,447 --> 01:20:20,280
(? Santana Featuring Rob Thomas:
Smooth)

1121
01:20:26,687 --> 01:20:29,155
- Take me to a bar.
- What kind of bar?

1122
01:20:29,207 --> 01:20:32,483
Just any bar.
Just your average American bar.

1123
01:20:33,207 --> 01:20:36,005
(On jukebox)? Man, it's a hot one

1124
01:20:36,047 --> 01:20:39,244
? Like seven inches
from the midday sun...?

1125
01:20:39,287 --> 01:20:42,916
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'd like a Budweiser, please.

1126
01:20:42,967 --> 01:20:46,243
- King of beers.
- Bud coming up.

1127
01:20:47,127 --> 01:20:49,322
Oh, my God.

1128
01:20:49,367 --> 01:20:51,198
Are you from England?

1129
01:20:52,767 --> 01:20:55,122
- Yes.
- Oh...

1130
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:58,045
that is so cute.

1131
01:20:58,087 --> 01:21:01,636
Hi, I'm Stacey. (Giggles)

1132
01:21:01,687 --> 01:21:03,678
Jeannie?

1133
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:07,523
Yeah?

1134
01:21:07,567 --> 01:21:10,240
- This is...
- Colin.

1135
01:21:11,687 --> 01:21:13,837
Frissell.

1136
01:21:13,887 --> 01:21:15,923
Cute name.

1137
01:21:15,967 --> 01:21:18,686
- Jeannie.
- He's from England.

1138
01:21:18,727 --> 01:21:20,877
Yep. Basildon.

1139
01:21:20,927 --> 01:21:23,725
- Oh.
- Oh.

1140
01:21:23,767 --> 01:21:28,522
Wait till Carol-Anne gets here.
She's crazy about English guys.

1141
01:21:28,567 --> 01:21:30,637
(Stacey) Uh-huh.

1142
01:21:33,567 --> 01:21:37,401
- Hey, girls.
- Carol-Anne, come meet Colin.

1143
01:21:37,447 --> 01:21:39,961
He's from England.

1144
01:21:40,007 --> 01:21:44,080
Well, step aside, ladies. This one's on me.

1145
01:21:47,087 --> 01:21:49,555
- Hey, gorgeous.
- (Gentle growl)

1146
01:21:51,247 --> 01:21:53,283
That is so funny!

1147
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:56,842
- What do you call that?
- Er, bottle.

1148
01:21:56,887 --> 01:21:58,923
(With English accent) "Bottle. "

1149
01:21:58,967 --> 01:22:00,958
- What about this?
- Er, straw.

1150
01:22:01,007 --> 01:22:02,804
(Girls) "Straw. "

1151
01:22:02,847 --> 01:22:04,758
- What about this?
- Table.

1152
01:22:05,967 --> 01:22:07,958
- Table. The same.
- Oh, it's the same.

1153
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:11,283
- Where are you staying?
- I don't actually know.

1154
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:14,046
I'll just check into a motel like in the movies.

1155
01:22:14,087 --> 01:22:17,284
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that is so cute.

1156
01:22:17,327 --> 01:22:21,878
No, no, no, listen. This may be a bit pushy
cos we just met you but...

1157
01:22:21,927 --> 01:22:24,361
why don't you come back
and sleep at our place?

1158
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:26,477
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1159
01:22:26,527 --> 01:22:29,405
Well, if it's not too much
of an inconvenience.

1160
01:22:29,447 --> 01:22:32,359
- Hell no!
- But there's one problem.

1161
01:22:32,407 --> 01:22:34,443
What?

1162
01:22:34,487 --> 01:22:38,002
Well, we're not the richest of girls,
you know.

1163
01:22:38,047 --> 01:22:42,837
So we just have a little bed and no couch.

1164
01:22:42,887 --> 01:22:46,118
So you'd have to share with all three of us.

1165
01:22:46,167 --> 01:22:52,356
And on this cold, cold night it's gonna be
crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1166
01:22:52,407 --> 01:22:55,080
And we can't even afford pyjamas.

1167
01:22:55,127 --> 01:22:57,436
No?

1168
01:22:57,487 --> 01:22:59,921
Which means...

1169
01:22:59,967 --> 01:23:02,083
we would be naked.

1170
01:23:06,567 --> 01:23:08,159
No, no, I think it'd be fine.

1171
01:23:08,207 --> 01:23:10,516
- (Girls) Great.
- Erm...

1172
01:23:10,567 --> 01:23:13,559
The thing that's gonna make it
more crowded...

1173
01:23:13,607 --> 01:23:15,723
Harriet. You haven't met Harriet.

1174
01:23:15,767 --> 01:23:17,564
- There's a fourth?
- Yeah.

1175
01:23:17,607 --> 01:23:21,759
Don't worry, you're totally gonna like her
cos she is "the sexy one".

1176
01:23:21,807 --> 01:23:24,480
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

1177
01:23:24,527 --> 01:23:28,236
- Praise the Lord!
- Oh, and he's a Christian.

1178
01:23:30,607 --> 01:23:32,199
(All) Cheers.

1179
01:23:32,247 --> 01:23:34,681
? If I could

1180
01:23:34,727 --> 01:23:36,797
? Then I would

1181
01:23:36,847 --> 01:23:40,886
? I'll go wherever you will go

1182
01:23:40,927 --> 01:23:42,883
? Way up high

1183
01:23:42,927 --> 01:23:44,918
? Or down low

1184
01:23:44,967 --> 01:23:49,006
? I'll go wherever you will go

1185
01:23:49,047 --> 01:23:52,323
? If I could turn back...?

1186
01:23:52,367 --> 01:23:55,484
One present only each tonight.
Who's got one for Dad?

1187
01:23:55,527 --> 01:23:57,438
- I have.
- Let Mummy go first.

1188
01:23:57,487 --> 01:24:00,524
- I'll get it.
- No, no, no. I want to choose mine.

1189
01:24:00,567 --> 01:24:02,762
I think I want...

1190
01:24:04,847 --> 01:24:08,476
...this one.
- I have bought the traditional scarf as well

1191
01:24:08,527 --> 01:24:12,315
but this is my other,
slightly special, personal one.

1192
01:24:12,367 --> 01:24:14,437
Thank you.

1193
01:24:14,487 --> 01:24:16,523
That's a real first.

1194
01:24:16,567 --> 01:24:18,922
- Rip it!
- What is it?

1195
01:24:18,967 --> 01:24:21,435
I'm going to... All right, I'll rip it.

1196
01:24:27,727 --> 01:24:30,036
God, that's a surprise.

1197
01:24:31,247 --> 01:24:32,965
(Daisy) What is it?

1198
01:24:34,767 --> 01:24:38,316
It's a CD. Joni Mitchell, wow.

1199
01:24:38,367 --> 01:24:40,642
To continue your emotional education.

1200
01:24:40,687 --> 01:24:42,803
Yes.

1201
01:24:42,847 --> 01:24:45,236
Goodness.

1202
01:24:45,287 --> 01:24:47,198
That's great.

1203
01:24:47,247 --> 01:24:50,080
- My brilliant wife.
- Ah, yes.

1204
01:24:52,247 --> 01:24:56,399
Actually, do you mind if I just absent myself
for a second?

1205
01:24:56,447 --> 01:24:59,245
All that ice cream. Er...

1206
01:24:59,287 --> 01:25:02,438
Darling, could you make sure
the kids are ready to go?

1207
01:25:02,487 --> 01:25:05,479
- Back in a minute.
- (Harry to kids) All right, take it easy.

1208
01:25:05,847 --> 01:25:07,724
(Bernie) Mine first. Mine.

1209
01:25:08,127 --> 01:25:10,800
(? Joni Mitchell: Both Sides Now)
? Moons and Junes

1210
01:25:10,847 --> 01:25:13,156
? And Ferris wheels

1211
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:19,595
? The dizzy dancing way that you feel

1212
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:24,516
? As every fairy tale comes real

1213
01:25:26,807 --> 01:25:29,196
? I've looked at love that way

1214
01:25:32,687 --> 01:25:36,202
? But now it's just another show

1215
01:25:38,327 --> 01:25:42,718
? And you leave 'em laughing when you go

1216
01:25:44,047 --> 01:25:46,686
? And if you care

1217
01:25:46,727 --> 01:25:48,843
? Don't let them know

1218
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:53,684
? Don't give yourself away

1219
01:25:56,367 --> 01:25:58,597
? I've looked at love

1220
01:25:58,647 --> 01:26:01,445
? From both sides now

1221
01:26:01,487 --> 01:26:03,523
? From give and take

1222
01:26:04,687 --> 01:26:07,759
? And still somehow

1223
01:26:07,807 --> 01:26:12,835
? It's love's illusions that I recall

1224
01:26:14,647 --> 01:26:17,002
? I really don't know love

1225
01:26:21,127 --> 01:26:23,766
? I really don't know love at all

1226
01:26:35,007 --> 01:26:37,202
? Tears and fears

1227
01:26:37,247 --> 01:26:39,966
? And feeling proud

1228
01:26:41,007 --> 01:26:45,876
? To say I love you right out loud

1229
01:26:46,927 --> 01:26:49,521
? Dreams and schemes

1230
01:26:49,567 --> 01:26:52,286
? And circus crowds

1231
01:26:53,567 --> 01:26:56,525
? I've looked at life that way

1232
01:26:57,927 --> 01:27:00,043
? Oh but now old friends...?

1233
01:27:00,087 --> 01:27:01,679
Oh, my God.

1234
01:27:01,727 --> 01:27:04,685
It's a miracle. You're all dressed.

1235
01:27:04,727 --> 01:27:07,685
Come on, come on, come on,
we're horribly late.

1236
01:27:07,727 --> 01:27:10,082
Come on, then. In the car. In the car.

1237
01:27:11,247 --> 01:27:13,966
? Well something's lost

1238
01:27:14,007 --> 01:27:15,804
? But something's gained

1239
01:27:17,167 --> 01:27:20,364
? In living every day?

1240
01:27:20,607 --> 01:27:23,565
- Has she noticed you yet?
- No.

1241
01:27:23,607 --> 01:27:28,078
But the thing about romance is people
only get together right at the very end.

1242
01:27:28,127 --> 01:27:30,243
Of course.

1243
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:34,996
By the way, I feel bad. I never ask you
how your love life is going.

1244
01:27:35,047 --> 01:27:36,958
Er-huh!

1245
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:38,759
No.

1246
01:27:38,807 --> 01:27:41,640
As you know,
that was a done deal long ago.

1247
01:27:42,887 --> 01:27:47,677
Unless Claudia Schiffer calls, in which case
I want you out of here straightaway,

1248
01:27:47,727 --> 01:27:50,844
- you wee motherless mongrel.
- Oh!

01:38:51,127 --> 01:38:55,837
(David) Oh, God, it's the longest street
in the world and I have absolutely no idea.

1409
01:38:55,887 --> 01:38:58,720
? Wrap your love around me

1410
01:38:58,767 --> 01:39:01,645
? You're so excited
I can feel you getting hotter?

1411
01:39:01,687 --> 01:39:03,598
(Doorbell)

1412
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:05,478
Hello, does Natalie live here?

1413
01:39:05,527 --> 01:39:08,883
- No.
- Right, fine, thank you. Sorry to disturb.

1414
01:39:08,927 --> 01:39:10,997
Here, aren't...

1415
01:39:11,047 --> 01:39:14,278
Aren't you the Prime Minister?

1416
01:39:14,327 --> 01:39:18,843
- Er, yes. In fact, I am. Merry Christmas.
- Oh.

1417
01:39:18,887 --> 01:39:22,596
Part of the service now. Trying to get round
everyone by New Year's Eve.

1418
01:39:22,647 --> 01:39:24,638
(Doorbell)

1419
01:39:26,647 --> 01:39:29,844
Ah. Hello. Does Natalie live here?

1420
01:39:29,887 --> 01:39:32,447
- No, she doesn't.
- Oh dear. OK.

1421
01:39:32,487 --> 01:39:35,638
- Are you singing carols?
- Er, no. No, I'm not.

1422
01:39:35,687 --> 01:39:38,804
- Please, sir, please.
- Please.

1423
01:39:41,527 --> 01:39:43,324
Well, I suppose I could.

1424
01:39:43,367 --> 01:39:45,164
Please.

1425
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:48,597
- All right.
- (Girls cheer)

1426
01:39:50,807 --> 01:39:53,685
? Good King Wenceslas looked out

1427
01:39:53,727 --> 01:39:57,356
? On the feast of Stephen

1428
01:39:57,407 --> 01:40:00,763
(Joins in with rich, deep voice)
? When the snow lay round about

1429
01:40:00,807 --> 01:40:04,117
? Deep and crisp and even

1430
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:07,557
? Brightly shone the moon that night?

1431
01:40:07,607 --> 01:40:10,075
- (Doorbell)
- Hello. Sorry to disturb.

1432
01:40:10,127 --> 01:40:13,005
- Does Natalie live here?
- No.

1433
01:40:13,047 --> 01:40:15,117
She lives next door.

1434
01:40:17,487 --> 01:40:20,001
Ah. Brilliant.

1435
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:22,925
You're not who I think you are, are you?

1436
01:40:22,967 --> 01:40:25,003
Yes and I'm sorry about all the cockups.

1437
01:40:25,047 --> 01:40:28,357
My cabinet are absolute crap.
We hope to do better next year.

1438
01:40:28,407 --> 01:40:30,557
Merry Christmas to you.

1439
01:40:42,687 --> 01:40:43,278
(Doorbell)

1440
01:40:44,727 --> 01:40:48,402
- (Chatting stops suddenly)
- Ah. Hello.

1441
01:40:48,447 --> 01:40:50,642
Is, er, Natalie in?

1442
01:40:50,687 --> 01:40:53,485
Oh, where the fuck is my fucking coat?

1443
01:40:54,767 --> 01:40:58,521
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

1444
01:40:58,567 --> 01:41:03,482
Erm, this is my mum and my dad
and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1445
01:41:03,527 --> 01:41:05,404
- Hello.
- Very nice to meet you.

1446
01:41:05,447 --> 01:41:09,122
And, erm... this is the Prime Minister.

1447
01:41:09,167 --> 01:41:11,965
Yes, we can see that, darling.

1448
01:41:12,007 --> 01:41:14,726
And erm, unfortunately, we're very late.

1449
01:41:14,767 --> 01:41:17,759
It's the school Christmas concert,
you see, David.

1450
01:41:17,807 --> 01:41:21,117
All the local schools have joined together,
even St Basil's...

1451
01:41:21,167 --> 01:41:24,876
- Too much detail, Mum.
- Anyway, how can we help, sir?

1452
01:41:24,927 --> 01:41:28,681
Well, I... just needed Natalie...

1453
01:41:31,327 --> 01:41:33,318
on some state business.

1454
01:41:33,367 --> 01:41:37,804
- Oh.
- Right, yes. Of course.

1455
01:41:37,847 --> 01:41:39,565
Right, er...

1456
01:41:39,607 --> 01:41:42,246
Well, perhaps you should
come on later, Plumpy.

1457
01:41:42,287 --> 01:41:43,640
Er, Natalie.

1458
01:41:43,687 --> 01:41:46,121
I don't want to make you late for the concert.

1459
01:41:46,167 --> 01:41:49,682
- No, it's nothing, really.
- Keith'll be very disappointed.

1460
01:41:49,727 --> 01:41:53,720
- No, really, it doesn't matter.
- The octopus costume's taken me months.

1461
01:41:53,767 --> 01:41:55,723
Eight is a lot of legs, David.

1462
01:41:55,767 --> 01:41:58,201
Mm. Erm...

1463
01:41:59,927 --> 01:42:01,963
Listen, why don't I give you a lift

1464
01:42:02,007 --> 01:42:06,922
and then we can talk about
this state business business in the car.

1465
01:42:08,407 --> 01:42:09,886
OK.

1466
01:42:09,927 --> 01:42:12,680
- Lovely, yes.
- Thank you.

1467
01:42:12,727 --> 01:42:14,763
Hold tight, everybody.

1468
01:42:21,087 --> 01:42:23,806
- How far is this place?
- Just round the corner.

1469
01:42:23,847 --> 01:42:26,441
Ah, right. Well, er...

1470
01:42:28,287 --> 01:42:30,437
I just wanted to say...

1471
01:42:32,287 --> 01:42:34,357
thank you for the Christmas card.

1472
01:42:34,407 --> 01:42:36,159
You're welcome.

1473
01:42:36,207 --> 01:42:38,084
Look, I'm so sorry about that day.

1474
01:42:38,127 --> 01:42:41,324
I came in and he slinked towards me
and there was a fire

1475
01:42:41,367 --> 01:42:45,679
and he's the President of the United States
and nothing happened, I promise.

1476
01:42:45,727 --> 01:42:48,764
I just felt like such a fool because...

1477
01:42:48,807 --> 01:42:51,958
I think about you all the time, actually.

1478
01:42:52,007 --> 01:42:55,283
- And I think you're the man that I really...
- We're here.

1479
01:42:55,327 --> 01:42:56,919
...love.
- Oh, wow.

1480
01:42:56,967 --> 01:42:59,527
That really was just round the corner. Er...

1481
01:43:01,167 --> 01:43:03,158
Erm...

1482
01:43:05,527 --> 01:43:07,677
Ow!

1483
01:43:11,687 --> 01:43:13,882
(Sighs)

1484
01:43:13,927 --> 01:43:16,122
Well, look, I...

1485
01:43:17,807 --> 01:43:20,241
I think I'd better not come in, you know?

1486
01:43:21,167 --> 01:43:24,603
Nobody wants some politician
stealing the kids' thunder.

1487
01:43:24,647 --> 01:43:28,117
No, please come. It'll be great.

1488
01:43:28,167 --> 01:43:30,761
No, I'd... I'd better not.

1489
01:43:31,807 --> 01:43:36,437
But I will be very sorry

1490
01:43:36,487 --> 01:43:38,523
to drive away from you.

1491
01:43:39,927 --> 01:43:42,043
Just give me one second.

1492
01:43:55,407 --> 01:43:58,444
John's been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1493
01:43:58,487 --> 01:44:01,479
- Erm... erm...
- Um... um...

1494
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:06,438
No!

1495
01:44:36,487 --> 01:44:40,002
Come on in. We can watch from backstage.

1496
01:44:40,047 --> 01:44:42,163
OK. Terry, I won't be long.

1497
01:44:45,487 --> 01:44:48,285
Look, this has to be a very secret visit, OK?

1498
01:44:48,327 --> 01:44:52,320
Don't worry. This was my school.
I know my way around. Come on.

1499
01:44:54,927 --> 01:44:58,044
Look, the sheep are ready already
and you're not even...

1500
01:44:58,087 --> 01:45:01,966
- Oh, David.
- Ah!

1501
01:45:02,007 --> 01:45:04,237
Oh, how are you?

1502
01:45:04,287 --> 01:45:08,200
Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey. You all right?

1503
01:45:08,247 --> 01:45:10,317
What the hell are you doing here?

1504
01:45:10,367 --> 01:45:13,279
- Well, you know...
- We always tell your secretary

1505
01:45:13,327 --> 01:45:17,878
that these things are going on but it never
occurred to me you'd actually turn up.

1506
01:45:17,927 --> 01:45:19,758
I thought it was time I did.

1507
01:45:19,807 --> 01:45:23,083
I didn't want anyone to see,
so I'm gonna hide somewhere.

1508
01:45:23,127 --> 01:45:25,482
Good luck, Daisy, good luck, Bernie.

1509
01:45:25,527 --> 01:45:29,122
I've never been gladder
to see my stupid big brother.

1510
01:45:29,167 --> 01:45:32,318
- Thank you.
- All right.

1511
01:45:32,367 --> 01:45:35,200
Oh, now. We haven't been introduced.

1512
01:45:35,247 --> 01:45:38,205
Right. Well, this is Gavin.

1513
01:45:38,247 --> 01:45:40,397
- Hello, Gavin.
- My copper.

1514
01:45:40,447 --> 01:45:42,438
And this is Natalie, who's my, erm...

1515
01:45:42,487 --> 01:45:45,240
- who's my, erm, catering manager.
- Oh.

1516
01:45:45,287 --> 01:45:47,278
- Hi.
- Catering manager.

1517
01:45:47,327 --> 01:45:49,318
Watch he keeps his hands off you.

1518
01:45:49,367 --> 01:45:51,483
20 years ago, you'd have been his type.

1519
01:45:51,527 --> 01:45:56,282
I'll be very careful. Don't try something, sir,
just because it's Christmas.

1520
01:45:56,327 --> 01:45:58,397
- No, seriously.
- (Bell)

1521
01:45:58,447 --> 01:46:00,722
Come on. Showtime. Quickly.

1522
01:46:00,767 --> 01:46:03,327
- Look, see you after, yeah?
- Probably.

1523
01:46:03,367 --> 01:46:06,200
- Thank you, Prime Minister.
- It's all right.

1524
01:46:06,247 --> 01:46:08,363
- Come on.
- Right.

1525
01:46:08,407 --> 01:46:11,558
? Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket

1526
01:46:11,607 --> 01:46:16,044
? Save it for a rainy day

1527
01:46:16,087 --> 01:46:20,000
? Catch a falling star
And put it in your pocket

1528
01:46:20,047 --> 01:46:23,084
? Never let it fade away

1529
01:46:24,127 --> 01:46:28,040
? Never let it fade away

1530
01:46:28,647 --> 01:46:33,596
? Never let it fade away?

1531
01:46:33,647 --> 01:46:35,638
(Cheering, applause)

1532
01:46:40,927 --> 01:46:44,397
Hillier School would now like to present
their Christmas number.

1533
01:46:44,447 --> 01:46:47,280
Lead vocals by ten-year-old
Joanna Anderson,

1534
01:46:47,327 --> 01:46:49,841
backing vocals coordinated by her mother,

1535
01:46:49,887 --> 01:46:52,037
the great Mrs Jean Anderson.

1536
01:46:52,087 --> 01:46:54,885
Erm, some of the staff
have decided to help out

1537
01:46:54,927 --> 01:46:59,284
and for this, we ask you to forgive us.

1538
01:46:59,327 --> 01:47:01,124
Thank you.

1539
01:47:01,167 --> 01:47:02,964
(Applause)

1540
01:47:06,607 --> 01:47:10,077
(A capella)? I don't want a lot for Christmas

1541
01:47:10,127 --> 01:47:14,279
? There's just one thing I need

1542
01:47:14,327 --> 01:47:17,524
? I don't care about the presents

1543
01:47:17,567 --> 01:47:21,321
? Underneath the Christmas tree

1544
01:47:21,367 --> 01:47:24,882
? I just want you for my own

1545
01:47:24,927 --> 01:47:28,602
? More than you could ever know

1546
01:47:28,647 --> 01:47:32,435
? Make my wish come true

1547
01:47:32,487 --> 01:47:36,480
? All I want for Christmas

1548
01:47:36,527 --> 01:47:43,922
? Is you

1549
01:47:45,887 --> 01:47:48,401
? I don't want a lot for Christmas

1550
01:47:48,447 --> 01:47:51,644
? There's just one thing I need

1551
01:47:51,687 --> 01:47:54,565
? I don't care about the presents

1552
01:47:54,607 --> 01:47:57,679
? Underneath the Christmas tree

1553
01:47:57,727 --> 01:48:00,924
? I just want you for my own

1554
01:48:00,967 --> 01:48:03,800
? More than you could ever know

1555
01:48:03,847 --> 01:48:06,839
? Make my wish come true

1556
01:48:06,887 --> 01:48:11,403
? All I want for Christmas is you

1557
01:48:12,967 --> 01:48:15,197
? You baby

1558
01:48:15,247 --> 01:48:19,001
? Oh, all the lights are shining

1559
01:48:19,047 --> 01:48:23,006
? So brightly everywhere

1560
01:48:23,047 --> 01:48:26,676
? And the sound of children's laughter
fills the air

1561
01:48:26,727 --> 01:48:29,036
? Laughter fills the air

1562
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:31,920
? Everyone is singing
? Oh yeah

1563
01:48:31,967 --> 01:48:34,276
? I hear those sleigh bells ringing

1564
01:48:34,327 --> 01:48:37,046
? Santa won't you bring me my honey

1565
01:48:37,087 --> 01:48:40,443
? Won't you please bring my baby to me

1566
01:48:40,487 --> 01:48:43,320
? I don't want a lot for Christmas

1567
01:48:43,367 --> 01:48:46,757
? This is all I'm asking for
? All I'm asking for

1568
01:48:46,807 --> 01:48:49,640
? I just wanna see my baby

1569
01:48:49,687 --> 01:48:52,724
? Standing right outside my door

1570
01:48:52,767 --> 01:48:55,361
? Cos I just want you for my own

1571
01:48:55,407 --> 01:48:58,604
? More than you could ever know
? You will ever know

1572
01:48:58,647 --> 01:49:01,878
? Make my wish come true

1573
01:49:01,927 --> 01:49:05,920
? All I want for Christmas

1574
01:49:05,967 --> 01:49:09,437
? Is you

1575
01:49:09,487 --> 01:49:11,717
? All I want for Christmas

1576
01:49:11,767 --> 01:49:15,157
? And you and you

1577
01:49:15,207 --> 01:49:18,005
? And you and you
? All I want for Christmas

1578
01:49:18,847 --> 01:49:22,283
? All I want for Christmas?

1579
01:49:22,327 --> 01:49:24,602
(Cheering, whistling)

1580
01:49:37,847 --> 01:49:39,758
Right.

1581
01:49:42,607 --> 01:49:44,916
So, not quite as secret as we'd hoped.

1582
01:49:44,967 --> 01:49:47,162
- What do we do now?
- Smile.

1583
01:49:48,207 --> 01:49:50,198
Little bow.

1584
01:49:53,447 --> 01:49:55,517
And a wave.

1585
01:50:08,287 --> 01:50:11,404
Absolutely no idea.
I mean, can you imagine?

1586
01:50:11,447 --> 01:50:13,483
I'll see you later, all right?

1587
01:50:13,527 --> 01:50:15,597
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1588
01:50:17,927 --> 01:50:21,920
Tell me, if you were in my position,
what would you do?

1589
01:50:21,967 --> 01:50:23,958
What position is that?

1590
01:50:24,007 --> 01:50:27,602
Lmagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1591
01:50:27,647 --> 01:50:30,639
and, come Christmas,
gave it to somebody else.

1592
01:50:30,687 --> 01:50:33,360
- Oh, Karen...
- Would you wait around to find out...

1593
01:50:33,407 --> 01:50:35,967
- Good night.
- Night, darling. Happy Christmas.

1594
01:50:36,007 --> 01:50:38,885
Would you wait around to find out
if it's just a necklace

1595
01:50:38,927 --> 01:50:41,236
or if it's sex and a necklace

1596
01:50:41,287 --> 01:50:44,836
or if, worst of all, it's a necklace and love?

1597
01:50:46,047 --> 01:50:50,996
Would you stay? Knowing life
would always be a little bit worse?

1598
01:50:51,047 --> 01:50:54,403
- Or would you cut and run?
- Oh, God.

1599
01:50:58,807 --> 01:51:01,526
I am so in the wrong.

1600
01:51:01,567 --> 01:51:03,558
A classic fool.

1601
01:51:03,607 --> 01:51:06,679
Yes, but you've also made a fool out of me.

1602
01:51:06,727 --> 01:51:09,480
You've made the life I lead foolish, too.

1603
01:51:11,767 --> 01:51:14,645
Darling. Ooh, darlings!

1604
01:51:14,687 --> 01:51:17,759
Oh, you were wonderful.

1605
01:51:17,807 --> 01:51:20,719
My little lobster, you were so...

1606
01:51:20,767 --> 01:51:22,997
What is that word?

1607
01:51:23,047 --> 01:51:25,197
Orange.

1608
01:51:25,247 --> 01:51:28,205
Come on, I've got treats at home.
Dad's coming.

1609
01:51:29,607 --> 01:51:34,158
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming, son.

1610
01:51:34,207 --> 01:51:38,120
- Thanks. Plan didn't work, though.
- Tell her, then.

1611
01:51:38,167 --> 01:51:39,998
- Tell her what?
- That you love her.

1612
01:51:40,047 --> 01:51:42,880
No way. Anyway, they fly tonight.

1613
01:51:42,927 --> 01:51:48,047
Even better. Sam, you've got nothing to lose
and you'll always regret it if you don't.

1614
01:51:49,567 --> 01:51:51,717
I never told your mum enough.

1615
01:51:51,767 --> 01:51:56,045
I should have told her every day
because she was perfect every day.

1616
01:51:57,127 --> 01:52:01,245
You've seen the films, kiddo.
It ain't over till it's over.

1617
01:52:03,127 --> 01:52:07,678
OK, Dad. Let's do it. Let's go get the shit
kicked out of us by love.

1618
01:52:07,727 --> 01:52:09,957
Yes.

1619
01:52:10,007 --> 01:52:12,237
- Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

1620
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:16,480
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

1621
01:52:16,527 --> 01:52:18,597
That's OK.

1622
01:52:18,647 --> 01:52:21,957
- My fault.
- No, no, really, it wasn't.

1623
01:52:22,007 --> 01:52:24,805
You're Sam's dad, aren't you?

1624
01:52:24,847 --> 01:52:27,645
Yeah. Stepdad, actually.

1625
01:52:27,687 --> 01:52:30,406
- Daniel.
- I'm Carol.

1626
01:52:30,447 --> 01:52:32,165
Carol.

1627
01:52:32,207 --> 01:52:36,439
- OK, I'm back. Let's go.
- Yeah. Well...

1628
01:52:37,767 --> 01:52:39,997
I hope we'll meet again, Karen.

1629
01:52:40,047 --> 01:52:42,197
Carol. (Laughs)

1630
01:52:43,487 --> 01:52:47,924
- I'll make sure we do.
- Yeah? Good.

1631
01:52:49,487 --> 01:52:51,478
(Carol laughs)

1632
01:52:55,447 --> 01:52:57,438
- Tell her.
- What?

1633
01:52:57,487 --> 01:53:00,399
- You know...
- Don't be such an arse.

1634
01:53:03,887 --> 01:53:05,923
- Look, there she is.
- Where?

1635
01:53:05,967 --> 01:53:08,162
Over there.

1636
01:53:09,927 --> 01:53:11,883
Oh, no.

1637
01:53:12,927 --> 01:53:15,805
It's OK, we'll go to the airport.
I know a short cut.

1638
01:53:30,367 --> 01:53:32,403
(Portuguese) Good evening.

1639
01:53:32,447 --> 01:53:35,359
- Senhor Barros?
- Sim.

1640
01:53:35,407 --> 01:53:38,956
I am here to ask your daughter

1641
01:53:39,007 --> 01:53:40,884
for her hands in marriage.

1642
01:53:40,927 --> 01:53:43,077
You want to marry my daughter?

1643
01:53:43,127 --> 01:53:44,958
Yes.

1644
01:53:45,007 --> 01:53:46,406
Come here,

1645
01:53:46,447 --> 01:53:47,926
there is a man at the door.

1646
01:53:49,447 --> 01:53:51,563
He wants to marry you.

1647
01:53:51,607 --> 01:53:52,926
But I've never seen him before.

1648
01:53:52,967 --> 01:53:54,320
Who cares?

1649
01:53:54,367 --> 01:53:56,517
You're going to sell me
to a complete stranger?

1650
01:53:56,567 --> 01:53:59,479
Sell? Who said sell? I'll pay him.

1651
01:53:59,527 --> 01:54:04,078
Pardon me. I'm meaning
your other daughter - Aurelia.

1652
01:54:04,127 --> 01:54:07,722
She's not here - she's at work. I'll take you.

1653
01:54:07,767 --> 01:54:09,200
You! Stay here.

1654
01:54:09,247 --> 01:54:12,080
As if I would. Stupid!

1655
01:54:14,887 --> 01:54:19,483
Father is about to sell Aurelia
as a slave to this Englishman.

1656
01:54:23,127 --> 01:54:25,118
Wait. Wait.

1657
01:54:28,327 --> 01:54:29,680
Oh, no.

1658
01:54:31,127 --> 01:54:32,924
You better not say yes, Father.

1659
01:54:32,967 --> 01:54:35,845
Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.

1660
01:54:40,767 --> 01:54:44,237
- Look, we're not actually flying.
- You can't come through.

1661
01:54:44,287 --> 01:54:48,519
Not even to let the boy say goodbye
to the love of his life?

1662
01:54:50,167 --> 01:54:52,044
No.

1663
01:54:54,047 --> 01:54:57,119
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- Boarding pass, sir?

1664
01:54:57,167 --> 01:55:00,603
Just a moment, I know I've got it.
Would you hang on to that?

1665
01:55:00,647 --> 01:55:02,603
- Unless...
- What?

1666
01:55:02,647 --> 01:55:05,115
- Do you want to make a run for it?
- Hold on to that.

1667
01:55:05,167 --> 01:55:07,601
- You think I should?
- Yeah.

1668
01:55:08,207 --> 01:55:11,199
- OK.
- Yes!

1669
01:55:11,247 --> 01:55:15,445
I must have left them
where I was having a cup of coffee.

1670
01:55:31,927 --> 01:55:34,566
(Beeping)

1671
01:56:14,727 --> 01:56:17,241
(Inaudible through glass)

1672
01:56:18,367 --> 01:56:20,676
(Chattering excitedly)

1673
01:56:25,287 --> 01:56:27,801
Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.

1674
01:56:27,847 --> 01:56:29,963
Cool!

1675
01:57:02,807 --> 01:57:04,798
Joanna.

1676
01:57:05,807 --> 01:57:07,798
Sam?

1677
01:57:10,887 --> 01:57:15,005
- I thought you didn't know my name.
- Course I do.

1678
01:57:15,047 --> 01:57:18,596
Oh, Jesus. Here, I've gotta run.

1679
01:58:08,967 --> 01:58:11,435
- (Portuguese) Where is Aurelia?
- Why should I tell you?

1680
01:58:11,487 --> 01:58:13,443
This man wants to marry her.

1681
01:58:13,487 --> 01:58:16,126
He can't do that - she's our best waitress.

1682
01:58:34,287 --> 01:58:36,005
Boa noite, Aurelia.

1683
01:58:37,487 --> 01:58:39,478
Boa noite, Jamie.

1684
01:58:54,167 --> 01:58:57,045
Beautiful Aurelia...

1685
01:58:57,087 --> 01:59:01,126
I've come here with a view to asking you...

1686
01:59:02,167 --> 01:59:04,283
to marriage me.

1687
01:59:05,567 --> 01:59:10,197
I know I seems an insane person
because I hardly knows you

1688
01:59:11,767 --> 01:59:18,479
but sometimes things are so transparency,

1689
01:59:19,727 --> 01:59:23,003
they don't need evidential proof.

1690
01:59:24,847 --> 01:59:30,604
And I will inhabit here,
or you can inhabit with me in England.

1691
01:59:30,647 --> 01:59:33,081
Definitely go for England, girl.

1692
01:59:33,127 --> 01:59:36,278
You'll meet Prince William -
then you can marry him instead.

1693
01:59:37,247 --> 01:59:43,004
Of course I don't expecting you
to be as foolish as me,

1694
01:59:43,847 --> 01:59:48,363
and of course I prediction you say no...

1695
01:59:49,407 --> 01:59:56,995
but it's Christmas
and I just wanted to... check.

1696
02:00:01,047 --> 02:00:04,517
Oh, God - say yes, you skinny moron.

1697
02:00:07,207 --> 02:00:09,198
(English) Thank you.

1698
02:00:10,927 --> 02:00:12,918
That will be nice.

1699
02:00:15,087 --> 02:00:17,760
Yes is being my answer.

1700
02:00:19,367 --> 02:00:21,597
Easy question.

1701
02:00:21,647 --> 02:00:24,002
(Portuguese) What did you say?

1702
02:00:24,047 --> 02:00:25,366
Yes, of course.

1703
02:00:25,607 --> 02:00:27,962
(Cheering)

1704
02:00:28,007 --> 02:00:30,237
Bravo!

1705
02:00:54,567 --> 02:00:56,637
(English) You learned English?

1706
02:00:57,127 --> 02:00:59,243
Just in cases.

1707
02:01:15,047 --> 02:01:17,845
(? Beach Boys: God Only Knows)

1708
02:01:31,447 --> 02:01:34,166
? I may not always love you

1709
02:01:35,087 --> 02:01:38,443
? But long as there are stars above you...?

1710
02:01:38,487 --> 02:01:39,886
Hello, Daisy.

1711
02:01:39,927 --> 02:01:42,760
- This one's Greta.
- Hello, Greta.

1712
02:01:42,807 --> 02:01:45,082
? I'll make you so sure about it...?

1713
02:01:45,127 --> 02:01:49,006
Here she is. This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet. This is Peter.

1714
02:01:49,047 --> 02:01:52,084
- Mark, didn't see you there.
- Just thought I'd tag along.

1715
02:01:52,127 --> 02:01:54,960
Jamie's friends are so good-looking.

1716
02:01:55,007 --> 02:01:57,202
He never tells me this.

1717
02:01:57,247 --> 02:02:00,284
I think maybe now
I have made the wrong choice,

1718
02:02:00,327 --> 02:02:01,965
picked wrong Englishman.
