314
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:52,134
Who wrote that?

315
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:53,594
Oh, one of the romantics,
I think.

316
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:55,638
Well, you're not sure.
(LAUGHS)

317
00:23:55,763 --> 00:23:59,767
Actually, I am, but I don't
want to come across like a know-it-all.

318
00:23:59,892 --> 00:24:01,143
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

319
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:02,520
Too bad.
I adore know-it-alls.

320
00:24:02,603 --> 00:24:03,604
Wa...

321
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:09,401
So, where are you off to?

322
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:13,197
Someplace with better food.
My apartment.

323
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:15,199
Yourself?

324
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:17,743
Back to the party.

325
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,996
I just wanted to spend
27 floors with you.

326
00:24:21,455 --> 00:24:23,958
- Well, that was a risky move.
- What?

327
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,628
Leaving your date upstairs.
I hope it was worth it.

328
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:31,298
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, Come on. That beautiful woman in blue.

329
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:33,968
Does her name happen to end in "kova"?

330
00:24:34,051 --> 00:24:35,052
(CHUCKLING)

331
00:24:35,177 --> 00:24:38,389
No. Her name is Agnes Boggs.

332
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:41,058
Her uncle's the chef.
I'll let him know you liked his food.

333
00:24:42,852 --> 00:24:44,436
And she's not my date.

334
00:24:50,776 --> 00:24:53,404
- HOTEL DOORMAN: Taxi, ma'am?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

335
00:24:58,576 --> 00:24:59,910
- Good night.
- Oh.

336
00:25:01,287 --> 00:25:02,830
I'll just wait with you.

337
00:25:02,913 --> 00:25:05,499
So you can find out where I live? (CHUCKLES)

338
00:25:06,292 --> 00:25:09,295
It does make it a lot easier to send flowers.

339
00:25:09,837 --> 00:25:13,048
(LAUGHS)
Okay. Thank you, but I'll manage.

340
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:18,429
Goodbye. It's been an adventure meeting you.

341
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,184
Thank you.

342
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,145
- Wait!
- Oh!

343
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:30,691
There you go again,
putting your hand in places it doesn't belong.

344
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:33,736
How do we get in touch?

345
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:35,863
Happy New Year, Ellis.

346
00:25:36,906 --> 00:25:38,115
Thank you, sir.

347
00:25:46,832 --> 00:25:48,918
Hi, honey.
How's your mom doing?

348
00:26:01,013 --> 00:26:02,348
(PANTING)

349
00:26:02,431 --> 00:26:04,725
- Am I late?
- No more than usual.

350
00:26:05,684 --> 00:26:06,727
Happy Birthday, Mama.

351
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:09,271
Thank you, darling.

(SOFT CHUCKLE)

353
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:13,984
I'm so happy to see you.

354
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:20,658
You know
you don't have to still give me cards.

355
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:23,535
I love you.

356
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:24,703
I love you, too.

357
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,375
- So, when are you moving back up?
- Third week in February.

358
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:32,044
- Right on schedule.
- Of course.

359
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:41,220
I see you already
forgot our little talk about sodium?

360
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:43,931
No. I am simply choosing to ignore it.

361
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:48,978
Actually, um...

362
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:52,856
I'm thinking of moving myself.

363
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:56,277
But you love where you live.

364
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,238
I do.
But, you know, there are just too many stairs.

365
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:03,367
Last week, Kay Alfonso fell

366
00:27:03,993 --> 00:27:05,369
and she broke her hip.

367
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:09,415
The doctor said
she might never leave the hospital.

368
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:14,169
And then the very next day
Molly Andrews called me

369
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:19,466
and she told me about this wonderful
retirement community in Arizona.

370
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,388
She moved in last spring. She said she'd
never been happier in her whole life.

371
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:29,393
What's the matter?

372
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:34,189
I only bought in Oregon
so that I could be close to you.

373
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:36,859
So you could come
up for long visits.

374
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:38,319
Move in with me eventually.

375
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:39,445
(CHOKES)

376
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:44,033
We haven't lived together
since I was in high school.

377
00:27:44,116 --> 00:27:46,410
But you're not
getting any younger.

378
00:27:47,786 --> 00:27:50,247
What if you moved
to Arizona and something happened to you?

379
00:27:50,331 --> 00:27:51,457
What if you got sick?

380
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:55,878
Then I would hope
that you would come and take care of me.

381
00:27:59,757 --> 00:28:00,883
What if I'm too late?

382
00:28:00,966 --> 00:28:02,593
No. No.

383
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:05,929
We cannot do this.
Not on your birthday.

384
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,598
It's a holiday.

385
00:28:14,271 --> 00:28:16,648
CORA: I nearly fell off
my feet.

386
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:19,485
- What are you two clucking about?
- Major news.

387
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:24,365
Mr. Jones is donating $50,000
worth of first edition classics to this library.

388
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,534
- What books? Do you know?
- We're going to find out very soon.

389
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:31,205
Because his office called to say that he'll be
here to deliver them himself.

390
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:34,041
- Hi. I'm Ellis.
- Oh, no.

391
00:28:34,124 --> 00:28:37,002
- Oh, good. Welcome, Mr. Jones.
- Thank you.

392
00:28:37,461 --> 00:28:40,964
On behalf
of the San Francisco Heritage Society,

393
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:45,052
I'd like to express our sincere gratitude
for your most generous gift.

394
00:28:45,135 --> 00:28:47,554
I left them in shipping and receiving,
but I'm sure they'll be right up.

395
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:50,766
If you don't mind, we'd like a photograph
of you donating the books.

396
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:52,351
Yeah. Sure.

397
00:28:53,477 --> 00:28:55,979
Can you give me one second, though?

398
00:28:58,023 --> 00:28:59,817
Hey. It's me.

399
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:02,861
The know-it-all.

400
00:29:02,945 --> 00:29:05,406
- What are you doing here?
- I got something for you, too.

401
00:29:07,908 --> 00:29:08,992
Some flowers.

402
00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:13,497

Dandelion Wine

00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,877
<i>White Oleander, Janet Fitch.</i>

405
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:20,337
(TITTERS)

406
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:23,340
Very clever.
(CHUCKLES)

407
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,719
How did you know
I work here?

408
00:29:27,803 --> 00:29:30,931
I just joined the board.
I saw you coming out of our meeting.

409
00:29:31,014 --> 00:29:32,015
Oh.

410
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:34,101
You could have mentioned that
in the elevator.

411
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:39,189
If we had met in
a taller building,

412
00:29:40,065 --> 00:29:41,817
I would have had
time to cover that.

413
00:29:46,071 --> 00:29:49,616
I don't know about you,
but I'm ready for some donating.

414
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:52,286
Great. I'll be here.

415
00:29:52,786 --> 00:29:55,789
No way. I would like for you
to accept the books on behalf of the library.

416
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:57,291
Oh, no. I can't do that.

417
00:29:57,374 --> 00:29:58,375
Yes, you can.

418
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,711
No. I don't want my photo taken.

419
00:30:01,003 --> 00:30:02,588
Don't worry. You look stunning.

420
00:30:02,671 --> 00:30:06,884
It's not about vanity.
I just don't like people taking my photograph.

421
00:30:08,594 --> 00:30:12,431
Suit yourself.
If you won't accept them, I won't donate them.

422
00:30:12,556 --> 00:30:15,809
- You wouldn't do that.
- I will. I'll even have a book burning.

423
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:22,149
I just...
I don't like having my photo taken, Ellis.

424
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:26,445
Okay, fine, fine.
Here's an alternative.

425
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:29,281
Let me take you out tomorrow.

426
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:32,993
Okay.

427
00:30:33,702 --> 00:30:35,370
That's impossible.

428
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:44,087
All right. Well, I'll just pack up the books
then. It's fine. Yeah.

429
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,590
(SIGHS)

430
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:48,759
Where?

431
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:54,181
Someplace you've never been.

432
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,101
Well, if it's in this city,
that's unlikely.

433
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:00,854
Try me.

434
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,025
MAN: You can leave your boots at the front
when you're done.

435
00:31:05,108 --> 00:31:07,486
- And I'll be right outside.
- We will. Thank you, Tom.

436
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:08,904
All right.

437
00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:14,868
All right. I give up.

438
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,122
In the first year
of the gold rush,

439
00:31:19,206 --> 00:31:22,417
about 60,000 people
came to San Francisco by ship.

440
00:31:22,876 --> 00:31:25,379
And a lot of them
hightailed it straight into the hills,

441
00:31:25,462 --> 00:31:27,339
leaving their boats behind.

442
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:30,300
Hundreds of boats
were left on shore.

443
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:34,721
Downtown San Francisco
was built right on top of them.

444
00:31:34,972 --> 00:31:36,223
Oh, I didn't know that.

445
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:41,645
Now, city services found this
when they were digging for a utility line.

446
00:31:43,564 --> 00:31:44,940
Oh, my God.

447
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,234
Isn't it something?

448
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,360
Oh...

449
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:49,444
Is that...

450
00:31:49,528 --> 00:31:50,779
Yeah, that's a boat.

451
00:31:51,863 --> 00:31:53,574
Oh, wow.

452
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:55,993
This is incredible.

453
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:58,829
So, we had the digging
stopped immediately, of course

454
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:01,540
because we want
this made available to the public.

455
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:02,708
We?

456
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:05,419
The San Francisco
Historical Preservation Society.

457
00:32:05,502 --> 00:32:07,754
Let me guess.
You're on the board.

458
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:10,549
Yeah, well,
they'll let anyone on the board these clays.

459
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:22,436
So, how did you come by
your fortune anyway? Inheritance?

460
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,354
Luck.

461
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:26,857
I was a math major
in college,

462
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,445
and in my spare time I developed an
algorithm for analyzing climate data.

463
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:36,575
But my roommate figured out that it could
also be used to make economic forecasts.

464
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:39,494
So we started a company
in our dorm room,

465
00:32:39,578 --> 00:32:43,665
sold it three years later,
and then with his half, he retired to Fiji,

466
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:46,835
and with my half, um,
you know, I'm doing this.

467
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,296
Your job
is giving away money.

468
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:50,380
Yeah, that's right.

you have to go out with me one more time
before you move away.

But it's subtle,
sophisticated,

488

won't even get it.

Oh, come on. "The Thumper."

What? Yeah.
That Ted Williams.

496
00:34:21,638 --> 00:34:23,724
Anyway, so,
he's hanging around Fenway,

497
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:25,267
and this horse walks up
and says,

498
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,643
"I want to play
for the Sox..."

- An actual horse? Hmm.
- An actual horse.

500
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:31,231
So, Ted's like,
"Okay, what can you do?"

501
00:34:31,314 --> 00:34:34,276
And the horse says, "I can hitjust like you
only a whole lot better."

502
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:38,029
So he picks up
a bat with his teeth and Ted's like, "Okay."

503
00:34:38,113 --> 00:34:40,782
And he throws him
a few and sure enough...

"Woah, what else can you do?"

507
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,418
And the horse says,
"Well, I can play shortstop."

508
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:54,588
So Ted hits him
a few ground balls and sure enough...

He's a vacuum cleaner.

510

and says, "Pitch?

The first time I saw you,
coming out of the board meeting,

00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:24,561
you were reading.

did you watch for?</i>

Yes, um, it was a book
in Norwegian,

641

and because of all
the umlauts over the vowels,

Yes, of course I am.

It was braille for beginners
or nursery rhymes or something.

and I'll believe it.

00:55:04,546 --> 00:55:05,714
I bet you got a name.

786
00:55:06,006 --> 00:55:07,299
Jennifer Larson.

787
00:55:08,383 --> 00:55:12,304
Please tell him
I understand if he doesn't want to see me.

788
00:55:12,387 --> 00:55:14,723
I'm just here to say I'm sorry.

789
00:55:15,307 --> 00:55:18,852
And that my life
has been unbelievable

790
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:23,148
since longer than he can imagine. And I just...

791
00:55:23,273 --> 00:55:25,650
I was emotional the other day. And...

792
00:55:27,402 --> 00:55:30,822
Now I realize
how incredibly kind to me he's been,

793
00:55:30,906 --> 00:55:33,658
and I've just been
too stupid to accept it.

794
00:55:33,742 --> 00:55:35,577
And I know better now.
And...

795
00:55:36,786 --> 00:55:40,415
And that's why
I want to tell him how sincerely sorry I am.

796
00:55:41,082 --> 00:55:42,083
Okay.

797
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:45,003
And ask if he could
come downstairs, maybe,

798
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:49,674
and let me make it up to him
by taking him out tonight.

799
00:55:51,134 --> 00:55:52,344
Please.

800
00:55:54,387 --> 00:55:58,516
Uh, there's a Jennifer Larson.
She says she understands if you don't...

801
00:55:59,142 --> 00:56:01,686
Oh, you heard that.
Okay, good.

802
00:56:02,771 --> 00:56:04,773
He wants to know
where you're taking him.

803
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:08,818
Someplace he's never
been before.

804
00:56:34,969 --> 00:56:36,638
- Hello.
- Hey, Jenny.

805
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:37,972
Come on.

806
00:56:45,813 --> 00:56:49,066
ELLIS: All right. You don't actually think
this is my first chop shop, do you?

807
00:56:49,149 --> 00:56:52,820
ADALINE: Oh, be quiet.
There's more here than meets the eye.

808
00:56:53,737 --> 00:56:57,866
This used to be one
of the most popular picture houses in the city.

809
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:01,036
- A movie theater?
- Yes.

810
00:57:02,496 --> 00:57:05,583
In the 1930s,
a woman named Mary Elizabeth Woods

811
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:09,378
read about a chemical magnate
who had created a drive-in theater

812
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:11,255
in Camden, New Jersey.

813
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:14,508
And so, naturally, she needed one of her
own here in San Francisco.

814
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:17,970
Everyone thought
she was crazy as a loon, which she was.

815
00:57:18,053 --> 00:57:20,097
She would sleep with anyone
who wasn't her husband.

816
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,100
And she used to put on these airs
like she was better than everyone else.

817
00:57:23,183 --> 00:57:24,810
Which, in fact...
(CHUCKLES)

818
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:28,022
- Anyway.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

819
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:31,734
Because of local ordinances,
she couldn't have an open-air theater,

820
00:57:31,817 --> 00:57:33,319
so she brought all
the cars in here.

821
00:57:33,861 --> 00:57:36,113
That's the screen
right there.

822
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:38,824
It was spectacular...

823
00:57:39,116 --> 00:57:40,367
I imagine.

824
00:57:44,038 --> 00:57:46,457
- Are you ready for the best part?
- Sure.

825
00:57:46,874 --> 00:57:48,375
Okay. Look up.

826
00:57:52,754 --> 00:57:54,131
ELLIS: Oh!

827
00:57:58,886 --> 00:58:02,306
ADALINE: She had
photo-luminescent filaments installed.

828
00:58:04,141 --> 00:58:06,894
They took the time
to create the constellations.

829
00:58:10,022 --> 00:58:11,732
ADALINE: Isn't it beautiful?

830
00:58:16,236 --> 00:58:17,362
Yeah.

831
00:58:26,371 --> 00:58:28,373
Haha. What are you doing?

832
00:58:29,208 --> 00:58:30,417
Come on.

833
00:58:35,589 --> 00:58:36,590
(GIGGLES)

834
00:58:42,596 --> 00:58:43,597
Cheers.

835
00:58:45,015 --> 00:58:47,768
ELLIS: The great paradox
of all this is that

836
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:51,522
the better our instruments get,
the farther we can see,

837
00:58:52,814 --> 00:58:55,609
but not into the future,
into the past,

838
00:58:56,443 --> 00:58:59,071
events whose light
hasn't even reached us yet.

839
00:58:59,154 --> 00:59:03,158
ADALINE: I don't think I'll ever understand
why so few people care about history.

840
00:59:03,242 --> 00:59:05,536
The future has
its charms, too.

841
00:59:08,163 --> 00:59:10,165
We could talk about ours.

842
00:59:12,251 --> 00:59:14,795
- Ellis...
- Not the distant future.

843
00:59:15,921 --> 00:59:18,215
I'm talking
about this weekend.

844
00:59:18,632 --> 00:59:20,008
What did you have in mind?

845
00:59:20,509 --> 00:59:25,013
My parents are having a party
to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary.

846
00:59:25,806 --> 00:59:27,933
It's just a couple hours
from here.

847
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,520
Come with me.

848
00:59:46,326 --> 00:59:47,411
Okay.

849
00:59:49,496 --> 00:59:51,123
- Can I drive?
- Huh.

850
00:59:58,088 --> 00:59:59,715
(ELLIS LAUGHING)

851
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:04,136
Oh, my God. You know,
you rarely see a Saab in the Daytona 500.

852
01:00:04,845 --> 01:00:06,096
There's a reason for that.

853
01:00:06,555 --> 01:00:09,016
You might want to consider
an occasional tap

854
01:00:09,099 --> 01:00:10,851
on that square pedal by your foot.

855
01:00:11,059 --> 01:00:12,811
I don't know what you're talking about.

856
01:00:12,894 --> 01:00:14,896
Oh! Woah, woah,
woah, woah, woah.

857
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,440
Oh, my God!

858
01:00:16,565 --> 01:00:17,566
(LAUGHS)

859
01:00:17,691 --> 01:00:19,026
Oh, I'm sorry.

860
01:00:20,152 --> 01:00:21,236
What's wrong with you?

861
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:31,622
Do me a favor.
Stop and pick her up.

862
01:00:31,705 --> 01:00:34,166
Oh, I'd rather not get stabbed. (SNICKERS)

863
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:35,334
That's my sister.

864
01:00:35,542 --> 01:00:36,877
- ADALINE: Oh!
-(BRAKES SCREECHING)

865
01:00:39,546 --> 01:00:40,922
- Sorry.
- (CHUCKLES)

866
01:00:46,261 --> 01:00:48,221
- What's up, pussycat?
- Do you need a ride?

867
01:00:48,889 --> 01:00:50,891
- What's it look like?
- (LAUGHS)

868
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,188
- How are you?
- Good. Hi.

869
01:00:56,396 --> 01:00:59,983
- Oh!
- Get out. Still driving the Saab. huh?

870
01:01:00,067 --> 01:01:01,026
ELLIS: Yeah. It's good to see you, too.

871
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:02,110
- Hello.
- Hey.

872
01:01:02,194 --> 01:01:03,987
Kikki, this is Jenny.

873
01:01:04,404 --> 01:01:05,989
Jenny, this is my sister.

874
01:01:06,073 --> 01:01:07,824
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

875
01:01:08,283 --> 01:01:10,410
You should have told me
you were taking the bus.

876
01:01:10,494 --> 01:01:11,870
We would have picked
you up at the station.

877
01:01:11,953 --> 01:01:14,790
I stopped using
telephones two months ago.

878
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:17,167
Any particular reason?

879
01:01:17,668 --> 01:01:19,670
To protest the involvement
of telecom firms

880
01:01:19,753 --> 01:01:22,089
in the development
of high-tech weapons systems.

881
01:01:22,172 --> 01:01:23,173
Oh.

882
01:01:23,757 --> 01:01:25,967
- Kikki graduated from Berkeley.
- Ah.

883
01:01:27,094 --> 01:01:29,096
So, this is the new one, huh?

884
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:31,348
(CLEARS THROAT)

885
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:33,266
Have you done him yet?

886
01:01:34,518 --> 01:01:36,728
Yes, 10 minutes ago,
right where you're sitting.

887
01:01:36,812 --> 01:01:38,271
(SOFT SNICKERING)

888
01:01:40,273 --> 01:01:43,735
So, what's the story with this girl?
She works there?

889
01:01:44,069 --> 01:01:46,780
I've told you
everything Ellis told me.

890
01:01:49,366 --> 01:01:50,617
Thank you.

891
01:01:50,701 --> 01:01:52,285
A beautiful girl

892
01:01:54,413 --> 01:01:56,540
working in a public library.

893
01:01:56,957 --> 01:01:59,710
Maybe she likes books.
And silence.

894
01:01:59,793 --> 01:02:01,294
Or maybe she Googled him,

895
01:02:01,378 --> 01:02:04,381
and found out about
his generous contribution and then

896
01:02:04,673 --> 01:02:08,176
worked her way in there
so she could get her hooks into him.

897
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:09,636
Yeah, I'll bet that's it.

898
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,304
Shouldn't they be here
by now?

899
01:02:11,471 --> 01:02:13,098
You clear the table.

Yeah, yeah.

How do I look?

903
01:02:29,906 --> 01:02:31,074
Very pretty.

Oh, honey.
Oh, you look great.

on the road.

- Hi, baby.

You must be exhausted
after your trip.

911

- Oh, no, it was nothing.
- We made it in, like, 18 minutes.

Now, I'm not amused.
He knows I hate it when he speeds.

you been?

Yeah. Yeah, I mean...

932
01:04:00,664 --> 01:04:02,499
We were very close. I...

933
01:04:02,582 --> 01:04:04,376
I knew her in London.

934
01:04:05,335 --> 01:04:08,004
Yeah. Yeah, she lived there in the '60s.

935
01:04:08,588 --> 01:04:12,425
Right before she moved to Paris,
and met my father.

- Incredible. What are the odds?
- What a small world.

Wow, wow.

The resemblance is...
ls absolutely amazing.

You must hear that
all the time.

For as long
as I can remember.

01:04:26,189 --> 01:04:30,277
You said that already, honey.
I can't believe you never mentioned her.

943
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,987
Oh, yeah, I must have.

944
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,865
No, no. I remember your close, close friends.

945
01:04:34,948 --> 01:04:37,117
How is she?
How is she doing?

946
01:04:39,452 --> 01:04:41,079
She passed away.

947
01:04:41,997 --> 01:04:43,498
Six years ago.

948
01:04:44,082 --> 01:04:45,458
No. Really?

949
01:04:46,835 --> 01:04:48,253
Oh, wow.

950
01:04:48,336 --> 01:04:49,796
I'm so sorry.

951
01:04:52,966 --> 01:04:53,967
Um...

952
01:04:55,176 --> 01:04:56,970
Extraordinary woman.

953
01:04:57,846 --> 01:05:00,307
Yeah, well,
it runs in the family.

01:05:05,437 --> 01:05:07,606
Come on.
Do you want something to eat or drink?

957
01:05:07,689 --> 01:05:09,649
KATHY: Yeah, yeah,
I made cheesecake.

958
01:05:10,025 --> 01:05:11,693
Um...

959
01:05:11,776 --> 01:05:13,361
We're kind of tired, actually.

960
01:05:14,654 --> 01:05:16,364
I think we'll head up
if that's okay with you.

961
01:05:16,823 --> 01:05:18,283
- Me, too. Mm-hmm.
- Really?

962
01:05:18,366 --> 01:05:20,285
All right.
Now, I have you in the back bedroom.

963

ELLIS: Ah, you're in the back.

964
01:05:23,121 --> 01:05:24,331
- Hey.
- Hey.

965
01:05:24,623 --> 01:05:25,916
It's so nice to meet you.

966
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:28,793

You know, if you keep doing that,
you're going to flood your engine.

971
01:06:38,822 --> 01:06:41,324
Thank you.
Thank you for the useful tip.

972
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:43,702
Well, you're going to get
one hell of a tan at least.

973
01:06:46,788 --> 01:06:50,667
I'm sorry. I've done everything
I could to get this thing started.

974
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:52,752
It just... It won't work.

975
01:06:54,254 --> 01:06:56,965
All right, all it needs
is a push start. Um...

976
01:06:57,048 --> 01:06:59,134
Just lose the brake,
I'll give you a push,

977
01:06:59,217 --> 01:07:01,219
you pop your clutch
and you'll take off.

Okay.

01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:07,308
Thank you.

- Ready. You ready?

981
01:07:11,146 --> 01:07:12,564
- Okay!
- Okay!

982
01:07:14,566 --> 01:07:16,026
Okay, now pop your clutch.

I didn't mean to embarrass you. It just...

- Hey.
- When did you come up?

1004
01:09:28,241 --> 01:09:30,034
Not too late.
I read for a while.

1005

Hmm.

Hi, baby.

1008

in a sec.

1009
01:09:38,251 --> 01:09:41,087
- She was up all night tossing and turning.
- KATHY: Oh.

1010
01:09:41,462 --> 01:09:43,464
You know,
you've never told us how you guys met.

1011
01:09:44,424 --> 01:09:47,343
Uh, we met in an elevator
on New Year's Eve.

1012
01:09:48,261 --> 01:09:49,429
Some coffee?

1013
01:09:49,554 --> 01:09:50,722
No, thank you.

1014
01:09:51,347 --> 01:09:53,766
ELLIS: But I'd seen her
once before that.

1015
01:09:54,267 --> 01:09:55,351
Hey.

1016
01:09:55,435 --> 01:09:58,771
It was at the library.
She was reading a book in braille and I just...

1017
01:09:58,855 --> 01:10:00,690
I knew she was an original.

1018
01:10:00,815 --> 01:10:03,276
Here you go, baby.
So was her mom.

1019
01:10:03,735 --> 01:10:05,361
How did you meet her mother?

1020
01:10:05,445 --> 01:10:05,777
WILLIAM: Uh, it was outside London.

1021
01:10:05,778 --> 01:10:08,364
WILLIAM: Uh, it was outside London.

1022
01:10:08,448 --> 01:10:11,201
Her car broke down.
I helped her fix it.

1023
01:10:12,118 --> 01:10:13,620
So, she was English.

1024
01:10:13,703 --> 01:10:16,122
Oh, no, no.
She was just there studying French.

1025
01:10:16,915 --> 01:10:18,499
She spoke, like,
what, four languages?

1026
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:19,876
I... I think so.

1027
01:10:19,959 --> 01:10:20,960
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1028
01:10:21,044 --> 01:10:23,755
- Jenny's brilliant with languages, too.
- WILLIAM: Really?

1029
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,507
So, um, how old were you
when you met her?

1030
01:10:26,799 --> 01:10:28,468
Oh, I was about...

1031
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:32,722
Let's see, it was the second
year of med school, so I was, like, 26.

1032
01:10:34,891 --> 01:10:38,186
I was thinking about quitting medicine.
I was bored.

1033
01:10:39,354 --> 01:10:40,647
But I was...

1034
01:10:41,648 --> 01:10:44,442
I was afraid I was too old to start over.

1035
01:10:46,027 --> 01:10:47,320
I told...

1036
01:10:48,571 --> 01:10:51,866
I told Adaline about it
and she just laughed in my face.

1037
01:10:52,075 --> 01:10:55,286
She said, "Go for it.
Don't be silly.

1038
01:10:56,162 --> 01:10:57,830
"Life's too short."

1039
01:10:58,206 --> 01:11:02,627
If it wasn't for her, I probably wouldn't
have found astronomy, physics.

1040
01:11:03,169 --> 01:11:06,673
She was only a couple years older than I was,
but she was so wise.

1041
01:11:06,756 --> 01:11:09,175
She was so sophisticated.

1042
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,517
Um...

1043
01:11:18,184 --> 01:11:19,352
She, uh...

What? What's going on?

1047
01:11:39,205 --> 01:11:40,873
What, you think this is funny?

1048
01:11:41,374 --> 01:11:43,501
What do you mean? What did I do?

1049
01:11:43,584 --> 01:11:46,170
"You were very close."
"You were very close."

1050
01:11:46,254 --> 01:11:48,631
You said that to me twice now.

1051
01:11:49,173 --> 01:11:51,884
And you should see your face
when you talk about her.

1052
01:11:51,968 --> 01:11:54,595
Are you going to wax nostalgic
this whole goddamn weekend?

1053
01:11:54,929 --> 01:11:58,558
Look. It's just that she looks
so much like her mother

1054
01:11:58,641 --> 01:12:02,437
that I'm remembering things
that I didn't even know I remembered.

1055
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,939
Well, I hate feeling
like second choice.

1056
01:12:05,023 --> 01:12:06,733
- What do you mean second choice?
- Especially this weekend.

1057
01:12:06,816 --> 01:12:08,234
- Second choice?
- Yes.

1058
01:12:08,609 --> 01:12:10,737
Forty years, baby.
Come on.

1059
01:12:11,321 --> 01:12:12,739
Second choice? Uh-uh.

1060
01:12:13,614 --> 01:12:16,284
Honey, you're blowing
this all out of proportion.

1061
01:12:16,367 --> 01:12:17,452
Am I?

1062
01:12:18,202 --> 01:12:19,370
Are you jealous?

1063
01:12:19,787 --> 01:12:20,788
Huh?

1064
01:12:20,913 --> 01:12:23,708
Well, yeah, as a matter of fact. (LAUGHING)

1065
01:12:24,876 --> 01:12:26,252
Look. Look.

1066
01:12:26,794 --> 01:12:28,421
It was fleeting.

1067
01:12:29,547 --> 01:12:31,132
Inconsequenfial.

1068
01:12:33,509 --> 01:12:36,262
It sounded like you
were more than that.

1069
01:12:38,306 --> 01:12:39,682
I love you.

1070
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,602
- I love you, too.
- Come on.

01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:07,668
It's not the most
romantic weekend.

1074
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:10,254
Thanks for being
such a good sport.

1075
01:13:10,338 --> 01:13:12,924
- Of course.
- I promise I'll make it up to you.

1076
01:13:26,771 --> 01:13:29,690
Sorry about my dad.
It's really embarrassing.

1077
01:13:30,817 --> 01:13:32,235
He's lovely.

1078
01:13:34,487 --> 01:13:37,615
Hey, your mom must have
really been something.

1079
01:13:39,033 --> 01:13:40,535
Yeah, she was.

1080

WILLIAM: (SHOUTING)
Kikki!

1081
01:13:50,795 --> 01:13:52,004
30, guys.

1082
01:13:52,088 --> 01:13:54,966
Dad is riding a
47 game winning streak.

1083
01:13:55,925 --> 01:13:57,844
All the money I spent
on your education,

1084
01:13:57,927 --> 01:13:59,720
I was hoping
for stronger competition.

1085
01:14:00,012 --> 01:14:02,056
- Have you played this before?
- No, never.

1086
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,266
Kikki, come on!

1087
01:14:03,349 --> 01:14:04,475
KIKKII DO I have 110?

1088
01:14:04,559 --> 01:14:05,643
ALL: Yes.

1089
01:14:07,019 --> 01:14:10,398
The idea is to get enough
of these little wedges...

1090
01:14:10,481 --> 01:14:12,442
- Of pie.
- They're cheese.

1091
01:14:12,859 --> 01:14:16,446
They're wedges. You get enough
of them to fill up your circle and you win.

1092
01:14:16,529 --> 01:14:17,488
Okay?

1093
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:20,366
KIKKI: Most of the questions
are about the stupidest stuff.

1094
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:21,951
Hence the word "trivial."

1095
01:14:22,034 --> 01:14:24,120
Yeah, like,
here's an example for you.

1096
01:14:24,203 --> 01:14:29,917
Um, "On June 22nd, 1938, this American boxer
retained his heavyweight championship

1097
01:14:30,001 --> 01:14:32,712
"when he beat Max Schmeling
in the first round."

1098
01:14:33,337 --> 01:14:36,799
- Well, that is a tough one.
- I know. What do you think?

1099
01:14:38,468 --> 01:14:39,594
Um...

1100
01:14:40,219 --> 01:14:41,262
Sonny Liston?

1101
01:14:41,888 --> 01:14:42,847
Joe Louis.

1102
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:44,015
Good guess, though. Really.

1103
01:14:44,098 --> 01:14:47,643
Yeah. Women and boxing. It's cute. Okay.

1104
01:14:47,727 --> 01:14:50,438
Excuse me. What did you say?

1105
01:14:50,521 --> 01:14:52,648
Okay, you know what?
Fine then. Ladies, we're on a team.

1106
01:14:52,732 --> 01:14:54,567
- Here, roll the dice.
- Here we go. All right.

1107
01:14:54,775 --> 01:14:56,152
Here we go.

1108
01:14:56,486 --> 01:14:58,237
The women are pink.

1109
01:14:58,488 --> 01:15:00,031
Women are pink?

1110
01:15:03,409 --> 01:15:07,079
"Who was the first United States
President to be born in a hospital?"

1111
01:15:07,163 --> 01:15:08,623
Jimmy Carter.

1112
01:15:12,376 --> 01:15:13,377
Jimmy Carter.

1113
01:15:13,461 --> 01:15:15,004
(CHEERING)

1114
01:15:15,087 --> 01:15:16,506
KIKKI: She's fast.

1115
01:15:16,589 --> 01:15:17,673
WILLIAM: Beginner's luck.

1116
01:15:17,757 --> 01:15:19,675
KATHY: I don't think so.
Try again.

1117
01:15:23,054 --> 01:15:25,348
"At what event
did the hula hoop make its debut?"

1118
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,730
In 1956 at the World's Fair
in Schenectady, New York.

1119
01:15:36,317 --> 01:15:38,986
"1956 World's Fair,
Schenectady, New York."

1120
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:41,614
Oh, my God.

1121
01:15:42,323 --> 01:15:43,699
- Nice one.
- Wow.

1122
01:15:45,117 --> 01:15:46,786
- Cheese.
- Pie.

1123
01:15:47,745 --> 01:15:48,913
Wedge.

1124
01:15:51,457 --> 01:15:54,001
All right.
Come on, let's do this.

1125
01:15:54,919 --> 01:15:56,212
- A lot of pressure.
- Do you smell something?

1126
01:15:56,295 --> 01:15:58,214
Like your winning streak
going up in smoke?

1127
01:15:58,297 --> 01:15:59,382
(LAUGHING)

1128
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:01,259
We used to have
this family joke.

1129
01:16:01,342 --> 01:16:04,512
<i>What</i> would happen <i>first,
Dad</i> loses <i>in Trivial Pursuit</i>

1130
01:16:05,137 --> 01:16:06,806
or Della finally appears?

1131
01:16:08,975 --> 01:16:10,184
"Della"?

1132
01:16:10,309 --> 01:16:11,936
Yeah, you remember
the comet I told you about,

1133
01:16:12,019 --> 01:16:13,437
the one that
my dad discovered?

1134
01:16:13,521 --> 01:16:16,357
He named it "Della C 1981"

1135
01:16:17,483 --> 01:16:19,610
After my great aunt, Adele.

1136
01:16:20,486 --> 01:16:21,946
- Okay, let's go.
- Yeah.

1137
01:16:22,029 --> 01:16:24,073
- Dad, come on.
- Here we go.

1138
01:16:24,657 --> 01:16:25,825
Jenny.

1139
01:16:27,285 --> 01:16:28,661
For the win.

1140
01:16:30,162 --> 01:16:35,209
"Of what country was Albert Einstein
offered the presidency in 1952?"

1141
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,842
Um, Israel.

1142
01:16:45,553 --> 01:16:46,762
Israel.

1143
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,599
(LAUGHING)

1144
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:55,271
It's okay. We still love you.

1145
01:16:55,354 --> 01:16:58,733
How does that feel, Dad?
Are you sad?

1146
01:16:59,609 --> 01:17:00,651
I'm all right.

1147
01:17:02,987 --> 01:17:05,364
Let's look at page two, okay?

1148
01:17:05,698 --> 01:17:07,825
Section three, paragraph H.

1149
01:17:08,534 --> 01:17:10,953
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, I'm going to go for a walk.

1150
01:17:11,037 --> 01:17:12,163
Sure.

1151
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:16,542
ELLIS: Uh-huh.

1152
01:17:19,253 --> 01:17:21,547
Yes. Now let's look at page 10.

1153
01:17:41,734 --> 01:17:45,071
How many stars
do you think there are in our galaxy?

1154
01:17:47,531 --> 01:17:49,533
I don't know, 500 million.

1155
01:17:49,617 --> 01:17:50,785
(LAUGHING)

1156
01:17:51,452 --> 01:17:53,329
Couple of 100 billion.

1157
01:17:59,585 --> 01:18:01,295
Plato believed that

1158
01:18:02,088 --> 01:18:05,758
every soul has a companion star
it returns to after death.

1159
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:08,552
If you lived a moral life.

1160
01:18:09,428 --> 01:18:10,429
You believe that?

1161
01:18:11,681 --> 01:18:13,391
No. No. I'm a...

1162
01:18:14,058 --> 01:18:18,688
I'm a scientist.
Plato was a philosopher, a poet.

1163
01:18:26,028 --> 01:18:28,948
Why did you name your comet
after my mother?

1164
01:18:32,785 --> 01:18:36,997
If my calculations were correct...
They turned out to be wrong.

1165
01:18:37,081 --> 01:18:43,129
It would have been the closest approach to
Earth of any comet in 200 years.

1166
01:18:44,797 --> 01:18:46,340
In other words,

1167
01:18:47,466 --> 01:18:49,176
like your mother...

1168
01:18:49,927 --> 01:18:51,303
A near miss.

1169
01:18:53,681 --> 01:18:55,474
What does that mean?

1170
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:02,273
I was going
to propose to her.

1171
01:19:05,985 --> 01:19:07,319
I had a... (LAUGHING)

1172
01:19:08,404 --> 01:19:11,031
I had an engagement ring in my pocket.

1173
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,786
She stood me up.

1174
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,168
A near miss.

1175
01:19:23,627 --> 01:19:25,004
Good night.

1176
01:19:32,136 --> 01:19:33,220
William.

1177
01:19:37,516 --> 01:19:39,268
She loved you, too.

1178
01:20:00,706 --> 01:20:01,707
ELLIS: Wow.

1179
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:06,712
And we just met, right?
I know that.

1180
01:20:09,548 --> 01:20:12,259
And I should probably
shut up right now.

1181
01:20:16,388 --> 01:20:18,057
I'll just shut up.

1182
01:20:18,349 --> 01:20:19,850
Come on. What?

1183
01:20:25,272 --> 01:20:26,649
What is it?

1184
01:20:26,732 --> 01:20:29,276
(STAMMERING)
I just got to tell you the truth. I...

1185
01:20:30,653 --> 01:20:33,197
I can't imagine
my life without you.

1186
01:20:33,948 --> 01:20:37,785
I know it's probably the last thing
you want to hear right now. But...

1187
01:20:39,745 --> 01:20:42,498
But I'm falling in love with you, Jenny.

1188
01:20:42,623 --> 01:20:44,250
I can't help it.

1189
01:20:46,252 --> 01:20:47,336
I...

1190
01:20:49,255 --> 01:20:51,257
I don't know what to say.

1191
01:20:52,633 --> 01:20:54,051
Um...

1192
01:20:55,636 --> 01:20:57,179
I wasn't expecting...

1193
01:20:57,263 --> 01:21:01,725
Please don't say anything, all right?
I just want you to know how I feel.

(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

Oh, hello.

01:21:20,703 --> 01:21:21,954
Jenny.

1197
01:21:22,955 --> 01:21:24,582
Do you know
where everyone went?

1198
01:21:24,832 --> 01:21:29,253
Yeah. Kathy and Kikki went to the market
and Ellis went for a run.

1199
01:21:29,795 --> 01:21:32,548
- Okay.
- Hold on. You have a bug in your hair.

1200
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,508
- It's all right.
- Oh! What is it?

1201
01:21:34,592 --> 01:21:35,676
It's a ladybug.

1202
01:21:37,511 --> 01:21:39,638
Oh, they say
they're good luck.

1203
01:21:41,015 --> 01:21:42,558
Did you get it?

1204
01:21:43,642 --> 01:21:45,603
- I got it.
- Thank you.

1205
01:21:50,649 --> 01:21:52,610
Please tell Ellis
I went for a walk.

- Della, are you okay?
- Oh, my God.

01:22:59,134 --> 01:23:00,302
This is going to sting
a little, okay?

1212
01:23:00,386 --> 01:23:01,470
Okay. Just do it quickly.

Uh, do you mind taking our photo?

- Sure.
- No, no.

No, it's okay. I don't...

- No, we're wasting film.

The scar. The same scar.

How? How is this possible?

01:25:50,889 --> 01:25:52,015
I...

1238
01:25:53,183 --> 01:25:54,643
I don't know.

1239
01:25:57,479 --> 01:25:59,273
(STAMMERING) I was normal.

1240
01:26:02,109 --> 01:26:04,528
And then one day,
I just stopped.

1241
01:26:07,573 --> 01:26:09,825
I wanted to tell you
so badly.

But I couldn't.

I would've been a...

A curiosity.

- A specimen.
- Yes.

1246
01:26:27,551 --> 01:26:29,303
That's why you left?

1247
01:26:30,262 --> 01:26:33,599
That's why you disappeared?

01:26:34,933 --> 01:26:36,226
- Oh.
- (MILD SOBBING)

1249

I think I can.

1253
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,163
And you've never
told anyone?

No.

There you are, honey.
Good girl.

1424
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:42,126
Yeah.

1425
01:43:45,671 --> 01:43:47,924
Hey, you guys,
you better hurry up.

1426
01:43:48,007 --> 01:43:49,592
You're going to be
late for the event.

1427
01:43:49,675 --> 01:43:51,469
ELLIS: Yeah, I've been

- Thank you.

1429

I'm ready, too.

1430
01:43:55,973 --> 01:43:57,099
Wow!

1431
01:43:57,183 --> 01:43:58,809
I just need this zipped.

1432
01:43:58,893 --> 01:44:00,353
Are you sure
you don't want to come with us?

1433

- I'm positive.

1434
01:44:03,272 --> 01:44:06,275

-Yeah.

FLEMMING: Yeah, it is.

1442
01:44:22,625 --> 01:44:24,502
Now he's really waiting
for the rest of his body

1443
01:44:24,585 --> 01:44:27,755
to catch up with the size
of his whiskers, right?

1444
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:52,697
ELLIS: Adaline, are you okay?

1445
01:44:56,659 --> 01:44:57,702
