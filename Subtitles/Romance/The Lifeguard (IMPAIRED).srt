This parking lot,

it was like the beating heart of our

We used to come here
every night.

230

Then we'd try and think of what
we were gonna do that night.

But really we would just end up
standing around the parking lot.

00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,823
You gonna quit?

324
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,993
I don't want to.

325
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:37,995
I really don't, but--

326
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,305
thought you were supposed
to be healthy, lifeguard.

327
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,942
I'm just supposed to
make sure you don't die.

328
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,317
You're talking about
middle schoolers?

329
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,552
There were four of them.

330
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:05,323
Leigh, were they standing on each other's shoulders,
or how did this--

331
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,592
I told mel
we'd pick her up later.

332
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,329
Do we have reservations?
For what?

333
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,498
Let's just, you know,
do whatever.

334
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,934
You don't even have to come.

335
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,670
Really. It might not even
be fun for you.

336
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,007
If you don't want me to come,
just say so, okay?

337
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:28,012
Maybe stay home?
Is that okay?

338
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,514
I just want to get it out of her-- you know,
what she's doing.

339
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,417
And then I'll come home
and tell you everything.

340
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,120
Yeah.
I really don't care.

341
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,923
You don't... Care?

342
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,628
You can't drink though.

343
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:48,999
One glass of red wine
is... Fine.

344
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,869
Honestly. How else would
french women get pregnant?

345
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,839
Oh, okay. Yeah.

346
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:56,574
Whatever, mel.

347
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,581
[Whispers]
Asshole.

348
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,049
[Exhales]

349
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:08,486
Hey.
Mmm. Jesus.

350
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,955
Hi. So--

351
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,825
lifeguard.

352
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,560
Yeah?

353
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,096
Can you buy us beer?

354
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:22,433
Please? Yeah.
Lumpy's brother was supposed to,

355
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:26,003
but circumstances
intervened.

356
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,072
No.
Why?

357
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,741
I mean, because
we have lives...

358
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:34,879
That don't need to be interrupted
by the long arm of the law.

359
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,714
What would we
get out of it?

360
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,150
I don't know.

361
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:41,051
I think you do.

362
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:46,991
What is valuable to someone
looking to broaden his mind?

363
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:50,161
Something you could perhaps purchase.
It grows in nature.

364
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,565
Oh.

365
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,867
A moment, please,
while we conference.

366
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,438
What about mel?

367
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,973
I don't know, lifeguard.
What about mel?

368
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,544
No. No, no, no.
Excuse me.

369
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:10,047
You didn't say anything about getting
weed from my 16-year-old students.

370
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,749
They look older.

371
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:14,018
Yeah. No.
We should go then.

372
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,753
Hey. No. No.

373
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,988
If you're so worried,
then don't do it.

374
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:22,726
Oh, that's so much fun.
I'm so glad that I left my car at home.

375
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:25,095
Then do it.
They'll think you're awesome.

376
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:29,700
Keep your voice down. No.
This is not-- I could get fired.

377
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,670
'Sup?
Vice principal smith-lentz.

378
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:35,172
[Sighs]

379
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:38,509
Hi, boys.
Um-- all right.

380
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:41,011
Let's talk about this,
because this is potentially...

381
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:44,515
Very confusing, I think,
for everyone.

382
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:48,519
I came here with these people not
knowing what they were intending to do...

383
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:51,689
Or with whom...

384
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:54,692
Or... What.

385
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:57,895
I don't care if you smoke weed with us...

386
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,632
Because
I'm droppin' out.

387
00:25:01,634 --> 00:25:03,968
Yeah, me too.
Yeah, I don't give a shit.

388
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,870
Are you insane?

389
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:08,239
Do-- do you actually want to face this cold,
harsh world...

390
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:10,508
Without
a high school diploma?

391
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,776
Why don't you just blind yourself while you're at it?

392
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:16,046
No.
I hate it here.

393
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:17,715
We're moving
to Vermont.

394
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,984
- [Mel] Vermont?
- Yeah.

395
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:22,253
I definitely am.
My sister's up there.

396
00:25:22,255 --> 00:25:26,056
Yeah, my mom's there with my stepdad,
like an hour away.

397
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,659
It's way better
than here.

398
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,761
You heard
what they said.

399
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:33,797
They're not
your students, so--

400
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,299
shall we?
Todd?

401
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,902
Great.
No. This is wrong.

402
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,937
To you, it is, mel.

403
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,239
Not to the rest of us.

404
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,675
Oh, wow.
This is-- now you see what I have to put up with.

405
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,677
Mm-hmm. But--

406
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,979
I-- hey. Hey.

407
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,249
No, I do not approve
of this!

408
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,594
You went to RH.S. Too?

409
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:05,729
Yeah.

410
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,600
Um, leigh was actually
valedictorian.

411
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,870
What were you?

412
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,306
Um, I--

413
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:17,975
well--

414
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:22,313
leonard, it actually took me
until after high school...

415
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:24,915
To really focus.

416
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,584
Really?

417
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,353
Oh, yeah.

418
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,328
[Todd] Do not share this
location with anyone unworthy.

419
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:43,601
Does the old lady have, like,
a fuckin' shotgun for trespassers?

420
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,703
She doesn't have
a shotgun.

421
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:49,707
But if I find out any
of your friends came here...

422
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,776
And desecrated
a tiger lily...

423
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:54,878
Or littered,
I <i>will</i> have a shotgun.

424
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,247
[Chuckling]

425
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:58,882
That's cool.

426
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,723
What?
Don't be an idiot.

427
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,825
Just--

428
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,361
I wish I could
impress that upon you.

429
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:15,899
Okay.

430
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,669
I know you think
this town is bad...

431
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,771
And, you know,
you need to leave,

432
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:24,675
but I don't think you realize how
privileged this experience is.

433
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,314
How's it privileged?

434
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,789
Nature, for one.

435
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,726
Excellent public school
education,

436
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:45,162
for two.

437
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:50,367
It's safe.
You're sheltered-- which you never will be again.

438
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:54,004
Well, me and him
get arrested one more time,

439
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,707
we're tried as adults.

440
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:59,143
My classes suck, so--

441
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:01,178
well, stop doing
dumb shit, "a."

442
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,747
And "b,"
Your classes don't suck.

443
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,716
I'm in special ed.

444
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,354
I have AD.D., so--

445
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,094
what?

446
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:22,066
Having AD.D. Does not mean
you should be in special ed.

447
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,035
Thanks.

448
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:27,905
I know.

Orion's belt.

450

Big dipper.

451
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,326
Mmm... Seven sisters.

452
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,005
You're 16.
You have your whole life ahead of you.

453
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,344
You have no idea
how lucky you are right now.

454
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,091
[Engine off]

455
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,127
Thank you for driving.

456
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:26,497
That was...
Probably unfortunate.

457
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,505
Fuck you guys.

458
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:41,078
- What?
- I really needed to have fun tonight.

459
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,880
And you didn't even care.

460
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:45,549
And you don't even--

461
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:48,952
you never ask
how I am or--

462
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,122
mel, what's-- what's wrong?

463
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,561
It's just really hard,
trying to get pregnant.

464
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,933
I-- I think
that's normal, right?

465
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,304
Isn't your life perfect?

466
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,140
No!

467
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,809
Oh!

468
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,579
Hey. Hey.

469
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:29,193
I read somewhere they did a
study of children in jamaica...

470
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:31,495
Whose mothers smoked weed
during utero,

471
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:35,532
and they were actually happier and
more creative than other children.

472
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,534
I believe that.
Absolutely.

473
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,137
Absolutely.
Mm-hmm.

474
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:44,241
"Remember to not be too nostalgic for this time.

476

[Coughing, laughing] In this
uncharted territory of our dreams.

Aw.

00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,552
Be brave and bold--

With both hands."
Both hands.

00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,964
Oh. So embarrassing.

Really?
It's that funny? Yeah.

And virgin?

488
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:23,480
Yes. See? What did I know?
[Phone ringing, muffled]

489
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:26,516
Absolutely nothing.
Mm-hmm.

Hi.
<i>[John speaking, faint]</i>

00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,894
Right.

495
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,364
I don't want to drive.

496
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:42,366
[Whispering] tell him you're too tired.
I'm very tired.

497
00:31:44,202 --> 00:31:46,503
I'm tired!

498
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,538
Because I've had
a long week.

499
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,042
No. John, I'm just tired.

500
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,680
Okay.

501
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,049
All right.
See you tomorrow.

502
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:01,318
Hey. I love you.

503
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,328
I'm sleeping over.
Yes!

504
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,497
I will prepare us
cereal.

[Exhales]

507
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,475
I'm so jealous of you.

508
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,713
Me? Why?

509
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,483
Because you
get to be lost.

510
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,572
It's okay.
Hey.

511
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,645
I thought you lived
in fox crest.

512
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,248
Yeah.

513
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,752
And you were too fucked up to walk
the 20 yards back to your bed?

514
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,655
My mom kicked me out.

515
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,657
Because you were
fucked up.

516
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,766
[Sighs]
I'm gonna go puke.

517

Here.

518
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:48,525
Better be careful, man. You pass out like
that in Vermont, you froze in the snow.

519
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,460
Ah, the myth of Vermont.

520
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,262
Myth?

521
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,297
Shee-at.
It's on the map.

522
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,037
Next week.
Well, that's just not gonna happen, man.

523
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,172
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. I know.

524
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:06,343
But that's why I'm trying to have a
conversation with you about cap rates. Right.

525
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:09,713
Exactly. Yes.
Well, that's why I hired you.

526
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,816
Don't be an asshole about it.
No, we don't trust bankers.

527
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:15,152
We do not trust bankers.
Okay?

[Dog barking in distance]

that's what you do.

00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:29,299
It's sort of like--
right. Yeah.

He's actually gotten worse.
I don't think that's--

548
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,746
no, because you started out
as a fairly good driver.

549
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:20,183
It was intentional bad driving.
Was it? It was intentional?

Hi, rick. How are ya?

00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:44,341
Listen, I know these guys.
Can I help at all in this situation?

557
00:35:44,343 --> 00:35:46,576
No.
This is police business.

558
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,679
- They're skating.
- And someone complained?

559
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:52,916
Or-- is there an ordinance against it?
I didn't think there was.

560

Ma'am, I'm gonna have to
ask you to go away now.

561
00:35:56,155 --> 00:36:00,323
Unless you have a valid reason to
be cornering these underage youths,

562
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,792
what you're doing right now
is called harassment.

563
00:36:02,794 --> 00:36:05,495
Maybe I should take you downtown
for impeding an arrest.

564
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,864
Am I impeding
an arrest?

565
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:11,268
If you have a reason to arrest
them and you can prove it,

566
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,436
then, I mean,
by all means take me down,

I will understand.

[Leigh]
Uh, I don't know.

Okay, well,
are you gonna look for something else around here?

579
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,443
Or were you gonna go back to
the city once the pool closes?

580
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,845
- I have no idea.
- Okay.

That's... Good.
Good.

will not.

[Laughs]
Okay.

588
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,867
[John] I can't believe it's not developed yet.

589
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,536
It's a park, john.

00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,805
Nature.
It's "pra-served."

Remember leigh had all these plans
about getting married under the arbor?

593
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:28,912
I'm thinking
it's water table issues.

594
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,514
Otherwise the city would've developed
the shit out of this place by now.

595

No way.

[Clears throat]

608

Me, on the other hand--

614
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:59,336
yeah, well, you know,
real life can be disappointing...

are so high.

Why not?

like, rape those kids.

Hey. Hey.

You can't say that.

631

Look, I just wanna hang out with adults.
Okay?

to ask?
