athletic build, blue eyes.
He's 5'9".

studies that show

180
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:55,546
tap water and bottled water
are basically the same thing.

181

And they recently passed
a law where restaurants

182
00:06:57,716 --> 00:07:00,250
have to filter their tap water,
so it's not really tap water,

183
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:01,986
it's filtered water,
which is the same

except you don't have to pay
$7 for it. Right?
