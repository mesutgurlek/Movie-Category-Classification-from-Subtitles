1
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,673
(sighs)

2
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,682
(howling in distance)

3
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,817
(inhales deeply)

4
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,326
(roaring in distance)

5
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,416
(sighs)

6
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,501
I have dogs bigger than that.

7
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,588
I thought you said
there were panthers here.

8
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,595
I ain't seen a panther
in these mountains for nine years.

9
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,055
Then what about the carcass
Snipes found up in Noland?

10
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,812
- Something mauled that.
- That weren't no panther.

11
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,853
The chest weren't tore open.

12
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,604
They eat the heart first.

13
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,194
You find me an honest-to-God panther
to hunt

14
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,495
and I'll give you a $20 gold piece.

15
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,871
If there's a panther still around,
it's likely touched by the devil.

16
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,327
May end up hunting you.

17
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,291
Well, I want one.

18
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,386
(grunts)

19
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,980
Vaughn. Would you have the girl
bring me my meal?

20
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,324
(church bell tolling)

21
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,320
(man 1) Coming down!
(man 2) Stand clear!

22
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,198
(man 1) Timber!

23
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,203
(indistinct conversations)

24
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,135
George!

25
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,263
All right, bring her around.

26
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,262
Albert! What are you doing out here?

27
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,440
Well, a letter came from the bank.

28
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,650
Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

29
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,651
Look, you're going to have to
renegotiate the loan.

30
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,019
I'll go up to Boston next week
and settle it. Don't fret.

31
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,290
(man) Get it up! Come on.

32
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,846
- My uncle's a partner. Don't forget.
- That's right but still.

33
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,088
See, if we go up the north ridge
and we carry it all the way down...

34
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,211
(grunts)

35
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,251
(man screaming)

36
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,884
(man) Get it off!

37
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,597
(groaning)

38
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,106
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

39
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,603
(brakes squealing)

40
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:14,083
Rumour has it that Congress is creating
a national park in Carolina.

41
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,967
Well, the park may come.

42
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,380
By the time the government takes
the land,

43
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,884
there won't be a tree standing.

44
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,594
The trouble is, George,
with this recent market crash,

45
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:28,018
I'm afraid your stocks are no longer
sufficient collateral

46
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,098
for us to roll a loan over.

47
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,938
I mean, all my capital
is wrapped up in Carolina.

48
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,988
What about this land in Brazil?

49
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,075
I'd rather not touch that.

50
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,449
(applause)

51
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,494
You should have married Peg Lowell
when you had the chance.

52
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,854
Then you wouldn't have to bow
and scrape for your bankers.

53
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,832
Well, you're up on the news, aren't you?

54
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,790
I am. That's why you should
talk to your sister more often.

55
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,796
- I came to visit you this week.
- Once.

56
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:57,967
In how long?

57
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,801
I don't know what you're doing
tearing down that mountain,

58
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,848
God knows where, and for what?

59
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,143
Why can't you ever do anything sensible?

60
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,553
I'm doing quite well, thank you.

61
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,226
- Will there be anything else?
- No, thank you.

62
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,993
(applause)

63
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,630
That woman you're slavering over
is practically an aborigine, you know.

64
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,797
Raised on a timber camp.

65
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,592
A timber camp?

66
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,716
Yes, I thought you'd like that.

67
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:45,181
Unfortunately, it burned down
and killed her whole family.

68
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,010
And two days after the fire,

69
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,347
a rescue party found Serena
wandering in the ruins,

70
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,272
calling for her dead brothers
and sisters.

71
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,352
She was so covered in ash,
they thought she was a ghost.

72
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,566
She is beautiful.

73
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,198
Wounded.

74
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,822
Mad for trees.

75
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,957
(George) Hmm.

76
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,619
It's a pity you don't stand a chance
with her.

77
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,542
What are you doing?

78
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,428
- I just wanted to say hello.
- (laughs) Well, hello.

79
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,427
George Pemberton.

80
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,972
Serena Shaw.

81
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,653
I think we should be married.

82
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,864
I can't wait to get there.

83
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,432
Oh! Welcome back!

84
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,732
- Splendid trip.
- Good!

85
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,401
- I can't wait to fill you in.
- Yeah.

86
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,070
I hope you didn't get all dolled up
on my account.

87
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,362
Oh, no, no.

88
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,037
- Hello.
- (Serena) Hello. (chuckles)

89
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,078
(stammers) What...

90
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,205
Well, what do you think of my wife?

91
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,588
What? Why didn't you tell me?
I, you know...

92
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,449
- Jesus, George! Why didn't you tell me?
- (both laughing)

93
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,758
I would have, you know...

94
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,553
This is Buchanan.
He's my right-hand man.

95
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,392
- Serena Pemberton.
- Oh.

96
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,012
Don't you know how to shake hands
properly, Mr. Buchanan?

97
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,605
Well, of course I do.
I'm very happy to meet you.

98
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,274
And, uh, well, welcome!

99
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,979
So did Galloway find my panther yet?

100
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,278
Well, a worker found some tracks
up on Laurel Creek

101
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,193
but Galloway thinks that was a bobcat.

102
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,866
- Are panthers common here?
- No, no, nothing to worry about.

103
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,070
I mean, there's some question
as to whether there are any left at all.

104
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,921
I was hoping to see my new home
before it gets dark.

105
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,836
Yes, of course.

106
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,678
- That girl...
- It doesn't matter.

107
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,094
Our love began the day we met.

108
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,064
Nothing that happened before
even exists.

109
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,868
(engine stops)

110
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,206
Keep your eyes closed.

111
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,047
- Give me your hand.
(giggles)

112
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,044
Step down. Watch your head.

113
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,968
One more. One more.
Okay. Okay. Wait.

114
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,722
On three, you can open your eyes.

115
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,097
One, two, three.

116
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,597
That's beautiful, George.

117
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,316
And that's just the start.

118
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,440
I bought an amazing property in Brazil.

119
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,651
- Brazil?
- Yes.

120
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,618
Virgin forest for hundreds of miles.
Mahogany.

121
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,372
Raw and beautiful.

122
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,795
Completely untouched.

123
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,875
Can't find something like that
in America.

124
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,717
You want that, don't you?

125
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,344
More than anything.

126
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,644
I never thought I'd find you.

127
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,103
I never thought I'd find anyone.

128
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,318
Really. You have no idea.

129
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,378
Doc! Doc!

130
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,334
Come on.

131
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,670
(man wheezing in pain)

132
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,593
(Campbell) Chaney!
Got ourselves another one.

133
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,969
Ah, you're too late. There's nothing
I can do. Put him in the chair.

134
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,555
(George) Rattlesnake?

135
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,386
(Buchanan) Yeah,
it's gotten worse since you left.

136
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,721
The crews get spooked and fall behind.

137
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,602
We've lost six men
in the last two months.

138
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,103
Shit.

139
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,611
In Colorado, we had a trained eagle
to keep the snakes under control.

140
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,363
Right. Well, I don't think
you'll find any eagles in Carolina,
Mrs. Pemberton.

141
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,574
Well, we should import one.

142
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,860
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, we should import one. Why not?

143
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,044
(man continues wheezing)

144
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:02,053
So I understand you have
some experience in the lumber
business, Mrs. Pemberton?

145
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,506
My father had 40,000 acres in Colorado.

146
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:05,886
Had?

147
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,934
I do hope he didn't lose them
in this awful crash.

148
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,266
He died.

149
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,436
(George) Her father was
a first-rate timber man, Dr. Chaney.

150
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,397
He had her riding the slope
before she could walk.

151
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,572
Well, that gives you
the advantage over us, Mrs. Pemberton.

152
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,366
I sure would like to
know what you think
of our little operation here.

153
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,448
Aside from our obvious lack
of an eagle, that is.

154
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,995
(all laughing)

155
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,037
I think you've taken nine months
to do about six months' work.

156
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,370
But a few changes should greatly
increase profitability.

157
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,914
What did you find, a wife or a partner?

158
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,424
Both.

159
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,091
I suppose Mrs. Buchanan
takes no interest in your work?

160
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,388
Oh, I'm a bachelor.

161
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,767
I can assure you, Mr. Buchanan,

162
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,265
I didn't come to Carolina
to do needlepoint.

163
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,938
Of course not.

164
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,526
She is a pistol.

165
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,125
Buchanan's a funny one, isn't he?

166
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,210
He seems a little bit, I don't know,

167
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,625
too fond of you.

168
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,967
What do you mean?

169
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,970
He'll loosen up.

170
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,639
Yeah.

171
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,536
(moaning softly)

172
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,556
- Good morning.
- (all) Good morning.

173
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:26,027
Mrs. Pemberton's father owned
the Vulcan Lumber Company in Colorado.

174
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,783
And she's equal to any man here.

175
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,864
I expect you to follow her orders

176
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,626
the same way you follow mine
or Mr. Campbell or Mr. Buchanan's.

177
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,381
And she'll take no quarter
and she'll expect none.

178
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,262
You'll soon see the truth of that.

179
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,967
Good day.

180
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,050
- Good morning.
- (all) Good morning.

181
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,135
(Campbell) Come on, now.
Let's get to it.

182
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,892
The trees ain't gonna
cut themselves, boys.

183
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,473
(clicks tongue)

184
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,838
- Mrs. Pemberton.
- Campbell.

185
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,125
How's everything going?

186
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,094
Well, good as can be expected, ma'am.

187
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,681
(Serena) Don't notch so high!

188
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,475
You're wasting a foot of timber.

189
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:41,018
Any lower won't fall clear, ma'am.
Yonder's in the way.

190
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,099
Give me your axe.

191
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,276
- Ma'am?
- You heard me.

192
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,662
- It'll clear.
- Ma'am.

193
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,169
What do you think?

194
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,217
She'll clear.

195
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,632
(Serena) Get back to work.

196
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,806
Who's that man up there?

197
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,058
His name is Galloway, ma'am.

198
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,982
- He seems standoffish.
- He is.

199
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,480
He's the best hunting guide
in over a hundred miles.

200
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:31,148
Track a grasshopper on a cap rock.
He say he has a gift of visioning.

201
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,862
Whatever that is, I don't know.

202
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,078
Mr. Galloway.

203
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,994
Serena Pemberton.

204
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,586
You were in prison.

205
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,846
Why?

206
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,599
Manslaughter.

207
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,096
He had it coming.

208
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,518
(man) Stand back, now.

209
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,779
(man 1) Timber!
(man 2) Tree down!

210
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,915
<i>(Kephart) Our Smoky Mountains contain
the last virgin forests</i>

211
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:25,626
<i>in the eastern United States.</i>

212
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,288
But with every passing year,
we're losing 'em

213
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:33,627
to the cut-and-run philosophy
of the logging barons.

214
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:40,805
But we're fools if we think
that what God has created

215
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,557
can be sacrificed for a quick profit.

216
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,311
The simple question before us is this,
ladies and gentlemen.

217
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:53,731
Do we want our Smoky Mountains
to be made a national park?

218
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,108
Or do we want them to be made a desert?

219
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,784
(men murmuring)

220
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,244
(applause)

221
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,999
Thank you, Mr. Kephart.
And thank you all for
showing up this afternoon.

222
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:07,918
- (George) What about the jobs, Sheriff?
- (men agreeing)

223
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,620
These men need to work, don't they?

224
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,942
And the logging camps bring
in railroads and electric lines

225
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,751
to places that never had them before.

226
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,587
We're bringing progress to Carolina.

227
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,598
Progress? Progress for whom,
Mr. Pemberton?

228
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,930
All the profits are going north.

229
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,432
Well, what is it
that your park's providing?

230
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,813
I'm sure your park
will be very nice for you

231
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,353
and your rich friends to go
on a Sunday afternoon hike

232
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,981
but for the working men,
the men in this room, Sheriff,

233
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,448
the men unlike you, Mr. Kephart,
it's a matter of survival.

234
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,157
He's right, Sheriff.

235
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:43,121
The logging barons always cry "jobs"
and "free enterprise"

236
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,291
but the truth is,
you barely pay enough
to put food on the table.

237
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:50,787
Oh, we pay more than
any job these men can get.

238
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,550
And that's why there's a line 50-deep
every time there's an opening.

239
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,385
Openings. Yes, you always have openings,
don't you, Mr. Pemberton?

240
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,805
Because your camps
have killed more men than
the War Between the States.

241
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,471
(George) It's dangerous work.

242
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,644
And every logger will tell you
he's proud of what he does.

243
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,319
And I don't think he wants
the government

244
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,972
to build him a pretty park, Sheriff.

245
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,728
I think he wants the freedom.

246
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,059
(crowd agreeing)

247
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:17,147
The freedom to work hard
and to better himself.

248
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,153
That's what this country
is supposed to be about, Sheriff!

249
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,985
(man 1) Yeah! That's right!
(man 2) Yeah! Yeah!

250
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,996
- You did wonderfully.
- Just told the truth.

251
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,663
One, two, three, smile! And flash!

252
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,041
(footsteps approaching)

253
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,173
I love you so much.

254
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,771
I have your child inside me.

255
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,377
(George laughing)

256
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,906
<i>- Namaste.
- Namaste.</i>

257
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,500
Vaughn!

258
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:01,309
Put my horse in the stable.
They need to get used to each other.

259
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,926
Yes, ma'am.

260
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,102
- I'll get you some food and blankets.
- Don't bother.

261
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,309
I won't eat or sleep until she does.

262
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,524
- Well, I'm staying here with you.
- No, you're not.

263
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,815
I need to do this alone.

264
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,608
They need to know that it was a woman
who tamed the eagle.

265
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,155
(George) All right. Everybody out.

266
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,803
Hi.

267
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,530
The prey believes that
if it keeps still, it won't be noticed.

268
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,817
But eventually it flinches.

269
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,327
And when it does,

270
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,871
the eagle always sees.

271
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,543
This, uh, park business
seems to be picking up speed.

272
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,254
Now that Rockefeller's
thrown in with them,
they're making real offers.

273
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,590
- They'll be coming to us next?
- Yeah.

274
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,381
Rockefeller's $5 million behind them.

275
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,087
We're not interested.

276
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,219
Well, I was asking your husband's
opinion, Mrs. Pemberton, not yours.

277
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,432
Easy.

278
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,065
Well, I don't want you
to worry about it.

279
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,733
Well, I do.

280
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,492
We'll need about a million
to pay off the loan

281
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,991
and have enough money
to get going in Brazil.

282
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,630
That's two more years here in Carolina,

283
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,078
assuming this park business
doesn't shut <i>us</i> down.

284
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,993
We're going to have to
pay off a senator.

285
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,622
Listen. What do you think of Serena?

286
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,760
Oh, well, she's a lovely girl.

287
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,467
I'm sorry. I should have
said something to you earlier.

288
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:53,965
But Serena is different, you know.

289
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,010
She'd rather come to a godforsaken place
like Carolina

290
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,104
than sip tea with society ladies.

291
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,522
Can you imagine a woman like that?

292
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:09,697
Well, I don't have to imagine her,
George. She's right here with us.

293
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,942
I just don't want you to think of her
as my wife.

294
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,993
I want you to think of her as a partner.

295
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,612
Because she is.

296
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,030
A partner.

297
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,000
- Every cent she has, she gave to us.
- Right.

298
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,121
Well, I will indeed. A partner.

299
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,151
(lock clicks)

300
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,485
- Good morning, Sheriff.
- Ladies.

301
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,207
(Buchanan) So, this is for you, Senator.

302
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:04,167
- You have a nice campaign, now.
- I will.

303
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,328
Good day, Mr. Buchanan.

304
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:10,883
Does Mr Pemberton think bribes
can stop the park?

305
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,878
Oh, well, nothing wrong
with having friends in high places.

306
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:18,181
I'm surprised Mrs. Pemberton
isn't handling the bribery by now.

307
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,185
I hear she's taken charge
of everything else at the camp.

308
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,847
I understand why
you might think so, Sheriff.

309
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,232
But you don't really know.

310
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,189
We'd like to make you a proposition.

311
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,294
- Sheriff McDowell.
- Buchanan.

312
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,217
- (Buchanan) Welcome. How are you today?
- Good. Thank you.

313
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,715
Good. Good to see you.

314
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,046
Mr. Kephart.

315
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,555
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

316
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,885
- How are you?
- All right.

317
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,391
They seem chummy.

318
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,724
Has Buchanan ever done business
for them before?

319
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,563
Not that I know of.

320
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,230
This is your offer, then?

321
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,569
$400,000.

322
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,401
That's a good deal more
than you'd get on the open
market, Mr. Pemberton.

323
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,781
Well, maybe that's true, Mr Kephart.

324
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,496
But we're asking
for a million dollars firm, so...

325
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,582
The land was appraised at 300.

326
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,088
Before the crash.

327
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,930
Well, I am very sorry
to have wasted your time today,
gentlemen but, um,

328
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:42,758
we were all under the assumption

329
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,014
that you were coming to us
with a formidable offer.

330
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,437
If we have to take this land
by eminent domain,

331
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,310
you'll be lucky to get a half
of what we're offering.

332
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,980
- Is that a threat, Sheriff?
- No, no, it's a fact.

333
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,024
Gentlemen, gentlemen, uh,
why don't we all, um,

334
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,480
reconsider our positions

335
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,108
and convene whenever
the Pembertons
and I have looked through...

336
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,193
(George) The fact is, Sheriff,

337
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,867
you need our land to build your park.

338
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,287
And our price is a million dollars.

339
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,871
Well, think a second time.

340
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,796
Because one false step
and those bankers you're in hock to

341
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,672
will be picking on the bones
of your fortune.

342
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,294
And I personally would hate to see
your pretty wife humiliated in that way.

343
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,304
You don't ever get to talk about wife,
let alone look at her.

344
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,885
You can leave now.

345
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,679
(McDowell) Good day. Good day, ma'am.

346
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,657
- How are you, Mr. Galloway?
- Well, Mr. Pemberton.

347
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,661
(engine sputtering)

348
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,341
I thought you were coming with us?
Galloway's got a line on a panther.

349
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,261
Oh. I'm afraid not.
I've got business in Asheville.

350
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,843
- On a Sunday?
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.

351
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,190
(Galloway) Bobcat.

352
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,361
But, um, that ain't what you want,
is it, Mr. Pemberton?

353
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:26,946
No, it's not.

354
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,781
Next time, we come at nightfall.

355
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,368
If there's a panther roundabout,
you'll hear it.

356
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,921
You know that, uh,

357
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,717
that park agitator, Kephart?

358
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,544
He has a cabin here.
Do you know where that is?

359
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:44,054
I reckon I do.

360
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:47,716
I'd like to take a look.

361
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,023
I went by Kephart's cabin.

362
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,530
I, uh... Yeah, I've been negotiating
with them.

363
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,493
- Behind my back.
- Yeah. Well, look. Listen.

364
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,495
Listen, they'll go <i>as</i> high as 450 now.

365
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,953
You said a million.
That's what you always said.

366
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,365
George, you're going to have to forget
about Brazil.

367
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,999
That's...

368
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,723
You're not the same any more.

369
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,385
The only thing that's changed is you.

370
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,225
Look. I just want out.

371
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,023
I'll buy you out
<i>as</i> soon as we move to Brazil.

372
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,900
Oh, I'm afraid I can't wait that long.

373
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,995
Well, I'm not going to sell, Albert,
so you can't do anything about it.

374
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,030
That's the agreement, till I sell.

375
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,241
You know what?
I'll tell them about the bribes.

376
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,537
- Go ahead. You're as guilty as I am.
- No.

377
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,883
You're going to take the fall, George.
I get a deal if I testify.

378
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:29,545
I've had that arranged.

379
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,383
You're going to go to prison.
That's what's going to happen.

380
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,606
You're a son of a bitch.

381
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,531
It's so obvious now. My friend?
He was never my friend.

382
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,405
He'd come here and threaten me
in my home?

383
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,945
What we've built?
What I promised you, Serena?

384
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,414
What I've promised you!

385
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,745
How did we lose Brazil, George?

386
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,085
I don't understand.

387
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,420
Well, I had to put the land up
as collateral,

388
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,756
otherwise the bank wouldn't
roll over the loan.

389
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,794
Because that's what he's doing.
He's going to make us sell

390
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,421
and we're going to lose it, Serena,
everything.

391
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,591
Our future.
Everything that we talked about.

392
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,767
Why didn't you tell me about the land?

393
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,599
Well, I didn't think
that it would matter.

394
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:23,064
How was I supposed to
know that he was doing back-door
deals with Kephart?

395
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,602
We promised
to tell each other everything.

396
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,898
(George sighs)

397
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,491
- I didn't want to frighten you.
- I'm not that kind of woman.

398
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,575
The only thing that frightens me
is the thought that you don't trust me.

399
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,291
I'm sorry.

400
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,586
I told you what he was
on the first night, George.

401
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,623
He's jealous of me.
He's trying to destroy what we have.

402
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,444
Well, we're running out of time.

403
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,255
He said he's already
making up the paperwork.

404
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,135
Then we have a real problem.

405
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,340
I go to prison, it'll be over for us.

406
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,934
Then solve it.

407
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:06,858
He betrayed you, George.
He was never your friend.

408
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,716
(dogs barking)

409
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,431
(Galloway) Keep the horses back,
Campbell.

410
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,354
You hear me, boys?

411
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,562
Let Mr. Pemberton and Mr. Buchanan
set up on the orchard.

412
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,398
(man) Come on. Get! Come on, now.

413
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,237
(Galloway) The bear's hunkered down
in them trees, Mr. Pemberton.

414
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,206
- Dogs will flush him out in no time.
- Thanks, Mr. Galloway.

415
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,252
(man) Get, get! Come on.
Go get him. Come on.

416
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,384
(Buchanan) Did Serena
take the news well?

417
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:03,259
Yeah, well, she's handled worse
than this, hasn't she?

418
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,561
Keeps her pride.
No matter what other people say.

419
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,800
(dogs barking in distance)

420
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,990
(roaring in distance)

421
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,158
(bear roars)

422
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,002
Well, did you see that?

423
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,842
What...

424
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,304
(stammers)

425
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,512
(cocks gun)

426
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,865
(cocks gun)

427
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,217
Help!

428
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,098
(dogs barking in distance)

429
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:18,401
Come on! Help me get him!

430
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,237
(man) We need help over here!
We got a man down!

431
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,122
- (McDowell) Chaney...
- One shot. Rifle.

432
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,930
(George) Sheriff.

433
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:51,471
We were set up on the same line
and the bear had come in between us

434
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,311
and by the time it had crossed through,
he was in my crosshairs.

435
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,439
Anyone with you?

436
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,276
No.

437
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,789
You see anything, Campbell?

438
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,471
No, I didn't see nothing, Sheriff.

439
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,642
Well, looks like your shot hit
dead centre of his heart.

440
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,477
Pretty amazing accident.

441
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,022
You and Buchanan got on, did you?

442
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,029
He was my best friend.

443
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,819
Take the body downtown.

444
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,829
I'm going to have an autopsy done.

445
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,836
You got anything to add?

446
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,874
It was an accident.

447
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:07,635
How do you know that?

448
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,473
He ain't a good enough shot
to do it on purpose.

449
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,557
Anything else, Sheriff?

450
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,686
Not today, Mr. Pemberton.

451
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,192
Not today.

452
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,368
I had decided not to...

453
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,876
But then he turned around.

454
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,831
I wish I could have been beside you.

455
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,716
He was never your friend.

456
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,882
He betrayed you, George.

457
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,096
You don't understand.

458
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:04,442
Everything you did, you did for us.

459
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:06,895
For our future.

460
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,258
Come in.

461
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,766
- Uh, Mr. Buchanan's things.
- Ah.

462
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,648
The coroner agreed it was an accident.

463
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:54,484
Wrote it in the report.

464
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,577
(footsteps receding)

465
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,789
(sighs)

466
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,325
(Serena) I love you so much.

467
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,851
(baby crying)

468
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,553
Thank you, sir.

469
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,559
Oh! Come on.

470
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,234
Four. So, 41.

471
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,240
(baby continues crying)

472
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,881
(water splashing)

473
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,766
Does my scar bother you?

474
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,932
Of course not.

475
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,562
Whatever happened in that fire?

476
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,115
I was 12.

477
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,668
I used to sleep downstairs
because I would wake up early

478
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,291
to take care of the horses.

479
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,834
And I didn't want
to wake the little ones.

480
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:06,304
That's how I got out in time.

481
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,974
I knew they were still inside.

482
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,320
But I just kept running.

483
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:28,449
And I kept going until
I couldn't hear them
screaming any more.

484
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,505
I was the oldest.

485
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,841
They were screaming for me.

486
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,817
You were only a child.

487
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:03,570
After that day, I swore that
I would never love
anyone ever again.

488
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:09,872
I can't lose you.

489
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,166
You won't.

490
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,874
Ever.

491
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:29,516
What is it?

492
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,892
Rachel Hermann has come.
She's looking for her old job back.

493
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,561
Well, where is she?

494
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,355
Over in the chapel.

495
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,737
But there ain't no work in this town,
not for a young lady of her kind.

496
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,108
Widow Jenkins is kind of looking after
that boy of hers.

497
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,312
If she don't get a job,
her and that boy will starve.

498
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:54,746
We both know it wasn't
her fault that she got pregnant
out of wedlock, now.

499
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:26,782
So you want your old job back?

500
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:28,784
Yes, sir.

501
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,781
- Well, you can start Monday.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,998
The, uh, child. What's the child's name?

503
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,961
Jacob. That's from the Bible.

504
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,264
That's a beautiful name.

505
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,809
Thank you.

506
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,306
Monday.

507
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:05,480
She knows that
she has no claim on us,
of course? Nor her child.

508
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:06,818
No, she knows that, of course.

509
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,191
Campbell just said that
there's no work in town

510
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,755
and I don't want to let them starve.

511
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,824
Does she intend to bring the child
to work with her?

512
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,368
No, there's an old widow
that's going to take care of him.

513
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,326
Him.

514
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,169
- So it's a boy.
- Apparently.

515
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,040
Look, it doesn't make
one difference to me.

516
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,676
It's just I don't want them to struggle,
that's all.

517
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,170
Nor do I.

518
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,355
(whistle blows)

519
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,196
(Galloway) All right, boys.
Break's over!

520
00:51:58,032 --> 00:51:59,500
Give me that.

521
00:52:02,995 --> 00:52:04,212
(inhales)

522
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,378
Sorry.

523
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:36,237
(photographer) Get his chin up.
Smile for me, Jacob.

524
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,784
Big smile, now.

525
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,075
That's it. Look at the birdie.

526
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,246
And, uh, hold it there now.

527
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:48,090
Can you get... Just raise him up
just a little bit higher, please?

528
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,878
That's good. That's good.
Just hold him there, now.

529
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,091
Okay. Jacob!

530
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,890
- Come on, now.
- (Rachel) Come on, now.

531
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,972
(photographer) Just look at me.

532
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,602
Look at me please, Jacob. There you go.

533
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:06,108
Smile for me, now! Smile!

534
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,941
- And flash!
- (flash fires)

535
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,323
Hold him still, miss.

536
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,668
Look at the birdie!
And flash!

537
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,969
(church bell tolling)

538
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,761
(door opening)

539
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,431
- You okay?
- Yes.

540
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:09,398
Come feel.

541
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,893
He's moving.

542
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,567
Right here.

543
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,202
Oh. Yeah.

544
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,578
The first of our dozen.

545
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,129
- You want me to take that?
- No, no, no!

546
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,378
I got it, Mr. Vaughn. Thank you.

547
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,427
It's perfect, George. He'll love it.

548
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:50,056
- How do you know it's a boy?
- I just do.

549
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:52,433
Well, maybe I'd like a girl.

550
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:55,148
No. You're not getting one.

551
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:57,442
- Is that right?
- Mmm-hmm.

552
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,776
Thank you.

553
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,837
- (whistle blowing)
- (man 1) Over here!

554
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,285
(man 2) Pick it up, now.

555
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,286
This one here.

556
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,973
(screaming)

557
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,816
Somebody give me a belt!
Give me your belt!

558
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:36,526
(groaning)

559
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,282
(screams)

560
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,285
(Serena) It's okay.
It's okay.

561
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,279
Get him on the car.

562
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:51,708
Campbell!
Chaney!

563
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,165
Load him up in the truck!

564
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,665
Campbell, go with him.

565
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,046
Get him in the van.
Come on, get in the truck.

566
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,003
Turn him around. Come on. I got him!

567
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:07,345
I'll live.

568
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,139
It's done been prophesied.

569
00:57:13,889 --> 00:57:16,017
Damn fine job,
whoever tied that tourniquet.

570
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:17,901
He would have bled out otherwise.

571
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,191
Did you do that?

572
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,201
Yes.

573
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,876
- Were you riding a horse?
- Uh-huh.

574
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,204
(groaning)

575
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,754
Most likely something hasn't
lain right on your stomach.

576
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,096
It really does not feel
like a stomach-ache.

577
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:46,430
Well, it certainly isn't labour.

578
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,177
Now, the hospital at Asheville

579
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:51,344
can give you a second opinion,
if the discomfort is too much for you.

580
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,682
Well, let's go there, then.

581
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,513
<i>That's not necessary.</i>

582
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,228
- Mmm-hmm. All right.
- (George) Bye.

583
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,363
(door closes)

584
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,233
(groaning)

585
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,446
<i>- I'll</i> get the doctor.
- No, George. George.

586
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,907
(breathing heavily)

587
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,454
(sighs)

588
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,081
I just want to try
to go to sleep.

589
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,965
All right.

590
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,425
You sure you don't want to
go to the hospital?

591
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,551
Yeah.

592
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,054
I'll feel better in the morning.

593
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,468
I love you.

594
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,595
I love you, too.

595
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:47,400
(Serena moaning)

596
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:48,909
Campbell!

597
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,153
(dogs howling)

598
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:53,580
Campbell!

599
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,418
- (Serena groans)
- Oh, God.

600
00:59:03,123 --> 00:59:04,625
(screaming)

601
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:12,637
- She's going to need more blood.
- (George) Use mine.

602
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,822
(sighs) It's going to be okay.

603
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,994
You're going to be fine.

604
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,168
(door opens)

605
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:04,188
(door closes)

606
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,212
The child is dead?

607
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,211
Yes.

608
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,347
A boy?

609
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,718
(George breathes deeply)

610
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,767
What?

611
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,561
What?

612
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,192
We won't be able to have another.

613
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,484
Take a warm bath
and I'll get the rest of the things.

614
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:18,194
- Get rid of it!
- What? What?

615
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,527
- Get rid of it! Get rid of it now!
- Okay, I'll...

616
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,346
(door closes)

617
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,097
(grunting)

618
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,778
(knocking)

619
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:37,290
I need to see your missus.

620
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:40,794
Well, she's resting now.

621
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,005
I can wait.

622
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,134
What for?

623
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,100
The day I was born, my mama had a vision

624
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,981
that I would lose much
but be saved by a woman.

625
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,148
Your missus <i>is</i>
the one from that prophecy.

626
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,150
And I'm honour-bound to her.

627
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,001
(lock clicking)

628
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,509
(men talking in distance)

629
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,677
(men grunting)

630
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:28,220
(axes chopping)

631
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:17,099
(sighs)

632
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,259
Mr. Pemberton!

633
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,141
(George) What is it?
We're about to leave.

634
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:36,353
Uh, payday.

635
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,141
Need you to come open the safe.

636
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,475
Here, you do it.

637
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,893
- Don't forget to bring the key back.
- Thank you.

638
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,904
Watch your head.

639
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,485
Okay.

640
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:48,879
You'll have to testify to what you saw.

641
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:50,677
And what you did.

642
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,383
I can't promise you won't do time.

643
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,967
Don't have to.

644
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,809
I fully understand the consequences
of my actions.

645
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:03,018
There's a judge in Raleigh
you can show these to.

646
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,150
One they don't own yet.

647
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,693
You sure you still want to
go through with this?

648
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,396
You want me to take 'em?

649
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,086
You look stunning.

650
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:32,923
Thank you.

651
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,185
Everything's going to be all right.

652
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,346
I know.

653
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,729
We're going to go downstairs
and we're going to
eat and dance and...

654
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:51,067
We're going to forget about
everything but each other.

655
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,951
- I won't be long.
- Okay.

656
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:08,375
(door closes)

657
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,489
(♫ man singing Bye Bye Blackbird)

658
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,418
(Calhoun) What level of investment
do you require?

659
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,003
(laughs) What's this, George?

660
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,680
This is my lovely wife.
This is Mr. Lowenstein.

661
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,349
The woman who tames eagles.

662
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,348
- Your reputation precedes you.
- (laughs)

663
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,688
Now, this is Mr. Calhoun.
These two gentlemen are...

664
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,314
(laughing)

665
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,021
(sighs)

666
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,189
Serena.

667
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,489
I want to dance.

668
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,275
These gentlemen are interested
in investing in Brazil.

669
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,861
But I love this song
and I really want to dance.

670
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:23,863
I think you should sit down.

671
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,207
- Will you dance with me, Mr. Lowenstein?
- No, that's not a good idea.

672
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:27,826
- Don't...
- Well, uh...

673
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,002
Of course, I'd be delighted to,
Mrs. Pemberton.

674
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,879
But I...

675
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:36,884
It's fine. Fine.

676
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,845
Thank you.

677
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:42,052
My husband is apparently
too busy to dance with me.

678
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,702
(both moaning)

679
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,025
Campbell's gone missing.

680
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,353
You might want to check the safe.

681
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,277
He took the ledgers.

682
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,407
(sighs)

683
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,963
He can destroy us, George.

684
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,256
Just like Buchanan.

685
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,441
(humming)

686
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,303
Hmm?
Hmm?

687
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,928
(continues humming)

688
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,516
(woman humming)

689
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:45,654
♫ Your daddy is a loving working man...

690
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:57,243
I know where Campbell is.

691
01:14:57,702 --> 01:14:59,079
Good.

692
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:27,861
Locking yourself in?

693
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,286
I saw some tracks by the falls.

694
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:34,701
Looks like a panther.

695
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:38,788
Let me know when you want to kill it.

696
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:37,351
(indistinct conversations)

697
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,201
(Galloway) Mr. Campbell?

698
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:17,910
(sobbing)

699
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:47,974
(screaming)

700
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,104
(gasps)

701
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:00,153
(screaming)

702
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:04,995
Get out!
Get out!

703
01:19:10,663 --> 01:19:12,131
(Campbell coughs)

704
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,594
(gurgling)

705
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,236
(cocking gun)

706
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:30,166
Vaughn?

707
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:37,424
Mr. Pemberton's going
to be very hungry
when he gets home.

708
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:38,884
Have cook make up all of his favourites

709
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,919
and bring them to the cabin
when he gets back.

710
01:20:41,712 --> 01:20:42,838
Yes, ma'am.

711
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,440
(men talking in distance)

712
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:13,789
Here's your supper.

713
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,964
I have some business to go take care of.

714
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,423
I'm doing this for us, George.

715
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,634
For our new world.

716
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,091
What are you talking about?

717
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:29,434
Brazil, of course.

718
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:32,309
We're going to be so happy there.

719
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,653
(door closes)

720
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,780
(engine starts)

721
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,168
(breathing deeply)

722
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:21,186
Give me the Sheriff. Quick!

723
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:32,198
(Galloway) Rachel stays with
the widow Jenkins sometimes.

724
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:33,703
It ain't far.

725
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:39,038
(doors closing)

726
01:23:19,495 --> 01:23:21,213
Mrs. Jenkins?

727
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,249
It's Sheriff McDowell.

728
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:28,512
Mrs. Jenkins?

729
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,779
We gotta get you out of here.

730
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,706
Is she all right?

731
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:21,728
- Mrs. Sloan.
- Come on in. Come on.

732
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,277
(knocking on door)

733
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:46,001
What can I do for you, Sheriff?

734
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,259
There was a murder
up on Colt Ridge last night.

735
01:24:49,835 --> 01:24:51,007
Widow named Jenkins.

736
01:24:51,503 --> 01:24:54,347
Never hurt a soul.
Somebody slashed her throat.

737
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,512
And, uh...

738
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:59,683
why are you telling me?

739
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,310
I'd like to speak to your wife,
if you don't mind.

740
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:05,604
My wife?

741
01:25:06,685 --> 01:25:08,028
She's not in there.

742
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:11,528
She went out with the cutting crew
earlier this morning.

743
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,692
That's convenient.

744
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:18,865
You happen to know
where she and that mongrel of
hers were last night?

745
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:22,330
I know she had nothing to do
with some old woman's murder.

746
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:28,374
Well, that woman was looking
after Rachel Hermann's boy.

747
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:36,715
Is the child all right?

748
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,635
Ask your wife.

749
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:46,896
I don't need to.

750
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:53,569
You make no mistake.

751
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:56,034
They were coming for your boy.

752
01:25:57,569 --> 01:26:00,038
Galloway slit Campbell's throat
the other day.

753
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,746
Your boy was next.

754
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:06,704
Expect your wife
can tell you why,
Mr. Pemberton.

755
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:18,090
(car door closes)

756
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:19,845
(car drives away)

757
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:06,771
Tell me you didn't do it.

758
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,735
Tell me you didn't send Galloway.

759
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:20,615
It's okay, George.

760
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:30,120
It's okay.

761
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:32,836
It had to be done.

762
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,167
For us.

763
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:46,762
What had to be done?

764
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:52,776
You hurt me.

765
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,863
You said that
I was enough for you.

766
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:03,369
You are enough for me.

767
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:05,864
You're lying.

768
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:10,707
I found the picture of your baby.

769
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:16,504
Our love is more important
than that child, isn't it?

770
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,055
Isn't it, George?

771
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:29,517
You just tell me where Galloway is.

772
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,982
- Just tell me where he is.
- No, come on. No...

773
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,400
- It'll all be over.
- No.

774
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:34,894
- Just tell me. Just...
- No.

775
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:39,402
It'll never be over
as long as that child is alive.

776
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,576
No, please... No...

777
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:46,493
You'll never be free of him.
Can't you see?
He looks just like you.

778
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:48,741
I had to.

779
01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,247
Just let the child go!

780
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:54,087
George. Stop.

781
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:55,922
George!

782
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,445
If you love your bastard child
as much, then just kill me.

783
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,600
That's the only way you'll ever stop me.

784
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,267
(coughs)

785
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,348
(choking)

786
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,575
(gasping)

787
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:51,728
(coughing)

788
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:22,133
(car engine starts)

789
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:27,597
(car driving away)

790
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:29,405
Where did you send Rachel and the boy?

791
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:31,866
That's a matter for the law.

792
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:34,744
This is everything you need
to put me away forever.

793
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:37,372
And what's that supposed to mean?

794
01:31:37,826 --> 01:31:39,874
It means that I'm turning myself in.

795
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,084
You just tell me where they are

796
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,165
and when I get back,
you'll have your arrest.

797
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,172
I don't need your help.

798
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:51,093
Do you know that Galloway never
came back to the camp last night?

799
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:53,091
I'll contact Rachel.
Tell her to move on.

800
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,093
He is going to find them, Sheriff.

801
01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:56,808
You know that <i>as</i> well as I do.

802
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:59,602
And what do you propose
to do about that?

803
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,901
Tell me where they are.

804
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:07,944
That's my boy, Sheriff.

805
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:12,782
(crowd murmuring)

806
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:23,121
- (Mrs. Sloan) So you'll be fine?
- Mmm.

807
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:24,460
I'll be back soon.

808
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:26,632
Bye-bye.

809
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:29,461
Bye.

810
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:37,018
(Rachel gasps)

811
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,814
Kingsport, Tennessee. Name of Sloan.

812
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:52,196
You got 24 hours,
then I'm calling the judge.

813
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:00,388
I need the next train to Washington.

814
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,960
There ain't one for another two hours.

815
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:04,838
- There anything sooner?
- No.

816
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:06,356
- (baby crying)
- (Rachel shushing)

817
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:28,687
- (Jacob fussing)
- Shh, shh. Hush.

818
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:53,086
(train whistle blowing)

819
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,179
Shh.

820
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:39,591
(inaudible)

821
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:01,321
(baby crying)

822
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:07,160
(sobbing) Hush...

823
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:16,173
(crying continues)

824
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:19,006
Please, no.

825
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:23,805
Mr. Galloway...

826
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:46,658
Stop.

827
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,536
It's okay.

828
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,708
- You say he'll be hunting?
- Yes, sir.

829
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:39,093
- Up in Noland.
- Hmm.

830
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:48,053
Let's go.

831
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:54,859
(train whistle blowing)

832
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:58,571
(Rachel) I told him if he's real quiet,

833
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:02,909
Joel'll give him some
more cars for his choo-choo
when we get there.

834
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:04,284
(train approaching)

835
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:05,574
Joel Vaughn?

836
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:08,698
Yeah.
He's going to take care of us now.

837
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:10,750
Jacob's real sweet on him.

838
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,974
You best say goodbye to him now.

839
01:37:36,142 --> 01:37:37,769
(babbling)

840
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:33,157
(grunts)

841
01:39:44,437 --> 01:39:45,780
(man 1) Spread out, boys.

842
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:47,774
(man 2) There, there.

843
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:49,776
All right. All right, come on.

844
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:15,927
(growls)

845
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:26,024
Son of a bitch.

846
01:41:02,807 --> 01:41:04,150
(car doors opening)

847
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:23,536
Mrs. Pemberton!

848
01:41:23,661 --> 01:41:25,663
- (banging on door)
- Mrs. Pemberton?

849
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,424
You need to come and identify.

850
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:29,875
(continues banging)

851
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,344
Mrs. Pemberton?

852
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:44,523
Mrs. Pemberton?

853
01:41:44,932 --> 01:41:47,776
Mrs. Pemberton, you need to come out
and identify your next of kin.

854
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:50,567
(exhales deeply)

855
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,535
All right. Let's take him away, then.

856
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:59,247
Come on, boys,
let's get back in the car.

857
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:03,372
(car doors closing)

858
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:02,570
(wood crackling)
