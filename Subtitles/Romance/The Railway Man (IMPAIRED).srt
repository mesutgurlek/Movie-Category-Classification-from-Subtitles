here in Thailand into Burma.

...building a railway,

409
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,993
is a hard, miserable job.

410
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,456
It's usually done by poor
immigrant workers.

411

were built by Chinese peasants.

And even the British railways,

00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:14,176
they were built by Irish navvies
fleeing from famine.

415
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,808

419

that to build such a railway,

420
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,996
it would be an act not
of engineering,

421
