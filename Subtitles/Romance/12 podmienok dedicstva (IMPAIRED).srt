the rest of the estate?

773
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,165
Sarah?

774
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:43,967
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

775
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,203
Well, you were
the last one in there.

776
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:50,974
- No, I wasn't.
- Well, that's just ridiculous, darling.

777
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,277
When we left, you were
the only one there.

778
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:58,117
Well, Jason was also there.

779
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,287
- Ah. Jason.
- [  jack ] Do enlighten us, Jason.

780
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,418
You certainly could not
have been the one...

781
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,054
that received the bulk
of Red's estate.

782
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:11,464
- [ Ruth ] Or are you?
- Is that why you insisted we
get together for Thanksgiving-

783
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,833
so you could reveal
your newly enhanced trust fund to us?

784
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:19,364
It's Thanksgiving. I was hoping
maybe we could all go around the table...

785
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,910
and each say something
that we're most thankful for.

786
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:27,307
[ Others Laughing ]

787
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,818
- Are you on crack, Jason?
- Again?

788
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,820
[ Laughing ]

789
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,118
Well, here's a thanks.

790
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,489
We don't have to put up with Dad's endless
litany of clichéd quotes this season.

791
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,495
Or hand-spun,
cornpone wisdom.

792
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,066
Who is that?

793
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,161
I think he works
down at the video store.

794
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:52,732
Well, Jason will tell you
all you need to know about this man...

795
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:56,245
this... dearly departed.

796
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,280
I mean, he more
than anyone here...

797
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:01,283
has a bone to pick
with the late, great Red Stevens.

798
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:05,344
[ Red ] Jason, I can only imagine
what you'vejust been through.

799
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:09,381
- I could never get them to be
thankful for anything either.
- [ Boy ] What have you got?

800
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,620
- Hey.
- [ Bill ] What in the world is that?

801
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:16,028
- All right, give it back.
- [ Boy ] Pass it to me. Come on.

802
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,727
- Give it back!
- [ Red Continues ] ...and if you do succeed...

803
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:22,795
- Here. Take it!
-you'll be one step closer to all I have for you.

804
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,568
What's ''all I have for you''?

805
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:28,133
It's between him and me.
It's none of your business.

806
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:32,079
It has everything to do with us.
It's our money!

807
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:34,742
So he's making you work
for your inheritance?

808
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:38,481
Not anymore, 'cause I don't
think I could ever win at this one.

809
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,080
Alexia, let's go.

810
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:45,924
- Jason. Wait. Wait!
- Don't!

811
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,986
Just tell them
what they want to hear.

812
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:50,362
I don't have
to tell them anything.

813
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:53,732
 Jason, you're gonna hear
from my attorney Monday morning.

814
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,067
- Yeah. Ditto.
- Shut up, jack.

815
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,299
You're all pathetic.

816
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:05,577
Wait.
 Jason, slow down.

817
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,310
I put up with that for years.
I was a part of that.

818
00:58:11,855 --> 00:58:14,824
What happened
to your dad?

819
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,689
He's dead. What else
do you want to know?

820
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,629
How'd he die?

821
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:23,427
The only person who really knows
just took it to his grave.

822
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:28,231
 Jason, there's something
I always want you to remember, okay?

823
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,534
When I met you,
you were a homeless person.

824
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:33,940
And you made friends
with my daughter.

825
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,342
We shared
peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches.

826
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,880
All this without me knowing
anything about your background.

827
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:44,813
Yeah, well, the problem is,
that's me back there.

828
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:49,382
Yeah, but you can walk away from all that.
You already have.

829
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:53,327
I appreciate what you're saying,
but money changes things.

830
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:57,833
It gets you stuff. It's a- It's a way
to live life worry free.

831
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:01,769
- Money takes away the worry.
- Yeah, I saw what money can do.

832
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:05,106
And your worries-

833
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:08,166
or whatever
you want to call them-

834
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,178
they're not
life or death, Jason.

835
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:14,114
Okay, I'm sorry, but my getting
my inheritance is a matter of life or death.

836
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:17,016
And I know when I say that,
I sound like I'm being a Stevens...

837
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,020
and being a Stevens
is all about money.

838
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:21,022
But it's not.
It's more.

839
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,423
[ Siren Wailing In Distance ]

840
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:36,994
So, I'll pay you back
as soon as possible.

841
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:40,966
What?

842
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:44,844
Uh, the money I owe you-
the 1,600.

843
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,642
Happy Thanksgiving.

844
