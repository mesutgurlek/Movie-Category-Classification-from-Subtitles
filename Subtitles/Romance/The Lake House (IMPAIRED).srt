Hey, uh, have you eaten?

642
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:04,548
No, but I'm not...

643
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,716
Neither have I.

644
00:40:05,718 --> 00:40:07,551
I just realized
I'm totally starving.

645
00:40:07,553 --> 00:40:08,719
We could grab a quick bite.

646
00:40:08,721 --> 00:40:09,987
Okay.

647
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:10,988
Yeah?

Oh.

00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:19,696
Perfect.

654
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:21,498
No, Morgan, it's...
It's not.

655

No, no, trust me.

656
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:25,036
It's... Okay.

Hi there.

658
00:40:27,374 --> 00:40:28,506
One sec.

659
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:30,174
Could you hold on
for a moment, please?

660
00:40:30,176 --> 00:40:31,409
We'd love a table for two.

661
00:40:31,411 --> 00:40:32,710
The name?

662
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:36,481
Oh, um... we don't...
We don't have a reservation.

663

I'm sorry, sir, we're booked...

until October.

Well...

I'll get back to you.

668
00:40:50,996 --> 00:40:51,996

It's the best restaurant
in town.

674
00:41:02,375 --> 00:41:04,074
Nobody gets a table here.

675
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:05,443
No, it's not that.

676
00:41:05,445 --> 00:41:07,712
Well, what is it?

677
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:14,352
I didn't do this right.

678
00:41:14,354 --> 00:41:15,853
There wasn't a meeting,
was there?

679
00:41:15,855 --> 00:41:17,422
You'd see me
if there was no big deal.

680
00:41:17,424 --> 00:41:18,856
If it was just...
Mm-hm, ambush.

681
00:41:18,858 --> 00:41:21,793
You know, coffee,
and coffee can turn into dinner,

682
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:22,893
and dinner can turn into...

683
00:41:22,895 --> 00:41:24,395
Turn into what?

684
00:41:24,397 --> 00:41:26,864
I'll admit, I do sometimes get
a few steps ahead of myself.

685
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:28,032
Morgan, a few steps?

686
00:41:28,034 --> 00:41:32,069
You're always leaping...
10 steps ahead.

687
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:35,573
We were dating, what, a week?

688
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:38,609
And you had our entire future
mapped out for us?

689
00:41:38,611 --> 00:41:40,010
Still in my residency,

690
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:41,479
you were picking out
real estate.

691
00:41:41,481 --> 00:41:43,180
I would go to your house
for the weekend,

692
00:41:43,182 --> 00:41:46,217
you'd have the entire town
in your house to meet me.

693
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:48,152
You know, I do seem
to remember that

694
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:50,555
you made pretty fast friends
with one of them.

695
00:41:50,557 --> 00:41:52,022
What are you talking about?

696
00:41:52,024 --> 00:41:53,591
Oh, you know
what I'm talking about.

697
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:54,792
That guy.
What guy?

698
00:41:54,794 --> 00:41:56,627
The guy I caught you
making out with.

699
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:58,195
I wasn't making out with him.

700
00:41:58,197 --> 00:41:59,230
What, are we in...

701
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:00,765
junior high school right now?

702
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,967
What do you call it, then?

703
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:05,770
A kiss.

704
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:10,040
It was just one kiss
with some random guy that just...

705

The guys are getting
to know their job,

717

but we could use
another backhoe.

needs to be resealed.

I'm kind of disappointed
in you.

722
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,743
Why?

723
00:42:45,745 --> 00:42:48,245
Because you're supposed to be
on top of things around here.

Well, you never noticed these.

726
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:55,119
Don't you remember?
You told me to get 'em.

Right, right.

728
00:42:56,656 --> 00:42:59,356
Wow. Not exactly
what I had in mind, but...

729
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:01,358
You like 'em?

730
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,627

<i>He wasn't at the funeral.</i>

1113
01:02:49,664 --> 01:02:51,497
<i>When I asked him why...</i>

1114
01:02:57,571 --> 01:03:00,039
Go on, Alex.
What did he say?

1115
01:03:04,445 --> 01:03:05,545
He said, "She was dead to me

1116
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:07,747
the moment she stepped
out of the house."

1117
01:03:11,184 --> 01:03:12,184
And then he gave me

1118
01:03:12,186 --> 01:03:15,020
one of his
architect-of-the-year grins.

1119
01:03:30,487 --> 01:03:31,988
I hope you appreciate this.

1120
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:34,958
I had to sneak past
three nurses and your Attending.

1121
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,593
Oh, jeez, it's hot.

1122
01:03:37,595 --> 01:03:39,195
It's not decaf, is it?

1123
01:03:39,197 --> 01:03:40,930
It should be, but it isn't.

1124
01:03:40,932 --> 01:03:44,868
Ah... Mm.

1125
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,603
That's not bad.
Thank you...

1126

You're welcome.

1128
01:03:50,475 --> 01:03:52,642
Where's your brother?

1129
01:03:52,644 --> 01:03:55,078
I sent him away.
He wasn't feeling well.

1130
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,946
You know how he is.
He worries.

1131
01:03:56,948 --> 01:03:58,181
Yeah, I know.

1132
01:03:58,183 --> 01:04:00,383
He gets that from your mother,
I'm afraid.

1133
01:04:00,385 --> 01:04:02,719
She always worried too much.

1134
01:04:02,721 --> 01:04:04,154
What are you looking at?

1135
01:04:04,156 --> 01:04:05,155
Hm?

1136
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:07,157
Oh, yeah, here, take a gander.

1137
01:04:07,159 --> 01:04:10,359
It's a proposal for a museum.

1138
01:04:10,361 --> 01:04:11,895
Who is it?

1139
01:04:11,897 --> 01:04:14,831
Oh, someone new.

1140
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:18,334
Oh, I like the walkways,
where the light falls.

1141
01:04:18,336 --> 01:04:20,103
What are the materials?

1142
01:04:20,105 --> 01:04:22,572
Granite. Aluminum.

1143
01:04:22,574 --> 01:04:25,075
White panels
are straight out of Meier,

1144
01:04:25,077 --> 01:04:27,543
but the interior color coming
through the front windows,

1145
01:04:27,545 --> 01:04:30,413
that's different.

1146
01:04:30,415 --> 01:04:33,983
It's not new,
but it's clean, uncluttered.

1147
01:04:33,985 --> 01:04:35,852
I like it.

1148
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:39,322
When was the last time
you were in Barcelona?

1149
01:04:41,092 --> 01:04:43,760
Years ago, with you,
Mom and Henry.

1150
01:04:43,762 --> 01:04:46,495
Do you remember visiting
Casa de la Caritat?

1151
01:04:47,564 --> 01:04:49,398
The almshouse.
Mm-hm.

1152
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,068
That's right.
You mentioned Meier.

1153
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:54,904
His Barcelona museum
stands in the same area

1154
01:04:54,906 --> 01:04:57,173
as Casa de la Caritat.

1155
01:04:57,175 --> 01:04:59,375
It drinks the same light.

1156
01:04:59,377 --> 01:05:03,046
Meier designed
a series of louvered skylights

1157
01:05:03,048 --> 01:05:04,513
to capture that light

1158
01:05:04,515 --> 01:05:07,617
and cast it inward
to illuminate the art within,

1159
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,518
but indirectly.

1160
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:10,754
And that was important,

1161
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:14,323
because although light
enhances art,

1162
01:05:14,325 --> 01:05:16,059
it can also degrade it.

1163
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:18,561
But you know all that already,
you son of a...

1164

(CHUCKLES)

(COUGHS)

1167
01:05:23,534 --> 01:05:25,701
where do you suppose
this is to be built?

1168
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:26,936
I have no idea.

1169
01:05:26,938 --> 01:05:28,271
Oh, but you said you liked it.

1170
01:05:28,273 --> 01:05:29,538
Conceptually.

1171
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,041
Now, come on.

1172
01:05:32,043 --> 01:05:34,744
You know as well as I do
that the light in Barcelona

1173
01:05:34,746 --> 01:05:37,446
is quite different
from the light in Tokyo.

1174
01:05:37,448 --> 01:05:40,750
And the light in Tokyo is
different from that in Prague.

1175
01:05:40,752 --> 01:05:42,986
A truly great structure,

1176
01:05:42,988 --> 01:05:46,956
one that is meant
to stand the tests of time,

1177
01:05:46,958 --> 01:05:49,659
never disregards
its environment.

1178
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:51,661
A serious architect
takes that into account.

1179
01:05:51,663 --> 01:05:53,629
He knows
that if he wants presence,

1180
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:56,599
he must consult with nature.

1181
01:05:56,601 --> 01:05:58,968
He must be captivated

1182
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:01,137
by the light.

1183
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:04,573
Always the light.
Always.
