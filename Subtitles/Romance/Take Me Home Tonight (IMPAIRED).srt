Her parents sent her
to Europe for the summer

as a graduation gift,
but she's back.

sightings of her in this mall.

about Tori Frederking.

That was in the tenth grade.

It was literally
seven minutes in heaven.

14

When we got out of that closet,
she told everyone at that party

15

that I was an amazing kisser.

16
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:34,434

- She did.

17

But you didn't kiss her.

her so fucking awesome.

When I got out of the closet,

21
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:43,308
everyone started ragging
on me for choking,

22
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:45,782
she lied and said
that I was an amazing kisser.

23
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:48,445
- Pretty stellar move, huh?
- To the max.

to ask her out after that?

950
00:51:34,603 --> 00:51:36,594
Say yen gets, uh...

951
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:41,672
...transferred from...
Mr. Nariata's bank...

952
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:45,840
...in Tokyo, on a Monday,
and it lands in Rome.

953
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:50,450
So what's.467 times 32?

954
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:53,852
149.5... lire. Right?

955
00:51:53,923 --> 00:51:56,824
Wham. Mr. Roma takes that, flips
it over to Mr. Queen Elizabeth.

956
00:51:56,892 --> 00:51:59,918
So what's 149.5 divided by 22.3?

957
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:02,862
Six pounds British sterling
and 78 pence, right?

958
00:52:02,932 --> 00:52:06,424
Wham, he takes it, flips it over
to Mr. USA Today before opening bell,

959
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:10,802
so what's 6.78 divided by 1.68?
It's 3.99 big, bad greenbacks,

960
00:52:10,873 --> 00:52:12,397
and guess who Mr. Yankee
Doodle Dandy wires it to

961
00:52:12,475 --> 00:52:14,409
over the international date line?
Mr. Nariata.

962
00:52:14,477 --> 00:52:17,935
How much is that yen worth now?
1.012, 1.2 percent more in one day.

963
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:22,074
1.2 percent times 365 days?
I'll do the math, but...

964
00:52:22,151 --> 00:52:23,880
It's a lot of fucking blowfish.

(GASPING)

1106
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,407
Hey! What the hell's he doing?

1107
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:34,608
Oh, he's getting a better angle.

1108
00:59:34,683 --> 00:59:36,480
OK, he can't come near me.

1109
00:59:36,552 --> 00:59:38,645
- How close?
- I don't want him touching me at all.

1110
00:59:41,156 --> 00:59:42,748
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1111
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:44,816
- Let me outta here.
- What, you don't like this?

1112
00:59:44,893 --> 00:59:45,882
Shit no!

1113
00:59:46,528 --> 00:59:47,620
Ow!

1114
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:49,561
- Yeah!
- You crazy bitch!

1115
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,622
Yeah, come on.
Lash out at me, Barry!

1116
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:54,566
Get the... I'll kill you!

1117
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:57,264
- I'll kill you!
- FRANCES: Fantastic!

1118
00:59:57,339 --> 00:59:58,431
Jesus!

1119
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:04,140
You people! Freakin' sick!

1120
01:00:04,213 --> 01:00:06,443
I didn't go to college, OK?

1121
01:00:06,515 --> 01:00:09,678
You people crossed the line
here today! This is entrapment!

1122
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:11,274
No thank you!

1123
01:00:11,353 --> 01:00:13,287
- (GASPING)
- (LAUGHING)

1124
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:17,918
God, it's like, "Who lives
in this neighborhood," right?

1125
01:00:17,993 --> 01:00:19,085
Yeah, I know.

1126
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:20,753
Actually... hang on one sec.

1127
01:00:24,766 --> 01:00:28,031
How do you feel about
a little bit of yard-hopping?

1128
01:00:28,103 --> 01:00:29,092
Uh... I don't...

1129
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:30,900
Come on, let's get out of here.

1130
01:00:36,245 --> 01:00:38,110
- Oh, my God!
- Shh...

1131
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:42,313
I don't think anyone's home.

1132
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:44,174
Really?

1133
01:00:45,087 --> 01:00:46,782
Welcome to your new house.

1134
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:48,789
How are you like this?

1135
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:50,882
No one else I work with is
this much fun.

1136
01:00:51,927 --> 01:00:53,792
I can't believe you're a banker.

1137
01:00:54,429 --> 01:00:56,488
Yeah. Me neither.

1138
01:01:00,636 --> 01:01:02,160
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1139
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:04,671
- Oh, yeah.
- Uh, no...

1140
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:07,573
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- No, not...

1141
01:01:07,643 --> 01:01:10,305
- Oh, we're doing this.
- I'm not getting on that thing.

1142
01:01:10,379 --> 01:01:11,471
Oh, yeah!

1143
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:14,481
Smooth. That was really smooth!

1144
01:01:14,549 --> 01:01:16,176
- Come on!
- No, I'm not!

1145
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:17,650
- I know you want to.
- I will watch...

1146
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:19,516
- Come on.
...safely from down here, thank you.

1147
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:22,751
Tori, tonight we're not thinking,
we're doing.

1148
01:01:22,824 --> 01:01:26,089
(♪ FREUR: "DOOT-DOOT")

1149
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:27,822
Come on. Whoa!

1150
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,591
(GIGGLING)

1151
01:01:36,905 --> 01:01:38,634
Yeah, this is
just coming back to me.

1152
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:41,005
Do you remember
when we played truth or dare

1153
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:42,668
at Lisa Mandriko's house?

1154
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:46,771
I think that you and I got dared
into seven minutes in heaven?

1155
01:01:46,848 --> 01:01:50,545
Hmm... No, doesn't ring a bell.

1156
01:01:52,554 --> 01:01:56,217
But, you know, maybe
if we played again...

1157
01:01:56,291 --> 01:01:57,553
You wanna play...

1158
01:01:58,827 --> 01:02:00,556
...truth or dare?
- Truth or dare?

1159
01:02:01,229 --> 01:02:02,890
OK. Wow.

1160
01:02:02,965 --> 01:02:04,956
Uh... Yeah, truth.

1161
01:02:05,033 --> 01:02:08,901
If I was your high school crush,
how come you never asked me out?

1162
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,935
Uh... You know, I just never had my in.

1163
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,307
Your "in"?

1164
01:02:16,378 --> 01:02:19,609
Yeah, you know, the right moment.

1165
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:22,650
You know, the perfect
confluence of events, where...

1166
01:02:27,789 --> 01:02:29,017
No.

1167
01:02:29,925 --> 01:02:33,554
No, I've been telling myself
that since high school.

1168
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:35,357
And it's bullshit.

1169
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,955
I had plenty of opportunities
to ask you out.

1170
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:41,801
I was afraid.

1171
01:02:44,172 --> 01:02:45,662
Truth.

1172
01:02:45,741 --> 01:02:48,232
If I had asked you out in high school,

1173
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,540
would you have said yes?

1174
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:55,748
Hm... That's not fair.

1175
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:57,648
If I had known then,
what I know now...

1176
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:00,984
Tori... come on.

1177
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:04,586
(SIGHING)

1178
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,989
No. I probably
wouldn't have said yes.

1179
01:03:12,234 --> 01:03:13,531
(CHUCKLING)

1180
01:03:13,602 --> 01:03:14,660
Why do you look so relieved?

1181
01:03:14,736 --> 01:03:17,170
(CHUCKLES) Because I am.

1182
01:03:17,906 --> 01:03:22,843
My biggest regret is not having
the balls to ask you out in high school.

1183
01:03:22,911 --> 01:03:24,811
And now I know that it
wouldn't have made a difference.

1184
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,111
Besides which, if I had, and you had
rejected me, I would have despised you,

1185
01:03:28,183 --> 01:03:29,673
and I wouldn't be sitting here
with you right now,

1186
01:03:29,751 --> 01:03:33,084
having the... (STAMMERS)

1187
01:03:33,155 --> 01:03:35,487
...having the best night
of my entire life.

1188
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:44,730
Dare.

1189
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:47,635
Come over here,

1190
01:03:47,702 --> 01:03:51,103
and bring your lips
as close to mine as possible

1191
01:03:51,173 --> 01:03:53,004
without touching.

1192
01:03:55,343 --> 01:03:57,106
Truth.

1193
01:03:57,179 --> 01:04:00,080
Are you messing with me right now?

1194
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,175
Dare.

1195
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,047
Come and find out.

1196
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:17,394
Come on...

1197
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:19,556
That good?

1198
01:04:19,634 --> 01:04:21,829
No, not good. A little closer.

1199
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,363
That's it.

1200
01:04:31,046 --> 01:04:32,570
What's that sound?

1201
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,944
I think that's my heart, beating like...

1202
01:04:38,887 --> 01:04:41,253
...really fast.

1203
01:04:43,058 --> 01:04:45,390
Dare me to make it go faster.

1204
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,893
I double dare you.

1205
01:05:13,788 --> 01:05:16,256
Oh... Hey, yeah, look...

1206
01:05:16,324 --> 01:05:18,690
No, you know what?
No pressure, OK?

1207
01:05:20,061 --> 01:05:21,619
Tonight, no thinking. Just doing.

1208
01:05:42,751 --> 01:05:44,912
BOTH: Now.

1209
01:05:54,763 --> 01:05:56,458
What's going on, Wenders?

1210
01:05:56,531 --> 01:05:59,762
Could we just sit down
for a second? I just want to talk.

1211
01:05:59,834 --> 01:06:01,426
(SIGHS)

1212
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:04,631
Well, this is a big step.

1213
01:06:04,706 --> 01:06:06,674
But I think it's the right thing.

1214
01:06:06,741 --> 01:06:08,208
Hell yes.

1215
01:06:08,276 --> 01:06:11,404
It doesn't exactly take
a rocket surgeon to figure that out.

1216
01:06:14,683 --> 01:06:16,446
Kyle, I have to tell you something.

1217
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:18,777
Please tell me you missed your period.

1218
01:06:18,853 --> 01:06:21,287
No, no...

1219
01:06:22,257 --> 01:06:23,815
I applied to grad school.

1220
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:25,723
Oh.

1221
01:06:25,794 --> 01:06:28,354
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Wow, grad school.

1222
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:30,990
Wow. Where?

1223
01:06:32,234 --> 01:06:34,668
- Cambridge?
- Is that in the Valley?

1224
01:06:34,736 --> 01:06:36,363
England.

1225
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:41,301
You want to go to England?

1226
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:43,469
Well, I mean, I don't... I don't know.

1227
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:46,207
I just thought we could talk about it.

1228
01:06:46,281 --> 01:06:48,511
- I don't even...
- What about the condo?

1229
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:51,211
Well, we could always
rent it out if we had to.

1230
01:06:51,286 --> 01:06:54,983
I don't know. I've got six franchises
opening in Encino alone next year.

1231
01:06:55,056 --> 01:06:56,318
I know.

1232
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:58,154
Honey, my dad is gonna
be fucking pissed.

1233
01:06:58,226 --> 01:07:00,319
Oh, goddamn it.

1234
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:02,158
I thought this was
gonna be a special night.

1235
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:03,788
- It is. No, it is.
- Guess I was wrong.

1236
01:07:03,865 --> 01:07:07,164
No, you're kind of questioning
the whole thing. Aren't you?

1237
01:07:07,235 --> 01:07:08,497
What, you just want to call
the whole thing off? Is that it?

1238
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:09,935
I don't even know if I got in yet, Kyle.

1239
01:07:10,005 --> 01:07:12,371
- Oh.
- (SIGHING)

1240
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,342
I've been too scared to open it,
so why don't you do it for me?

1241
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:18,606
Sure. Sure, Wenders.

1242
01:07:24,686 --> 01:07:26,449
"Dear Miss Franklin,

1243
01:07:26,521 --> 01:07:30,013
Thank you for your interest
in Cambridge University.

1244
01:07:30,091 --> 01:07:32,889
We regret to inf..."

1245
01:07:34,095 --> 01:07:36,791
Oh... sorry.

1246
01:07:37,632 --> 01:07:41,659
"We regret to inform you
that you have not been accepted

1247
01:07:41,736 --> 01:07:44,261
into our graduate program."

1248
01:07:45,206 --> 01:07:47,299
Goddamn it.

1249
01:07:50,278 --> 01:07:52,371
Hey, wait, come on.

1250
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:56,042
No, don't let some fancy-pants school
in England ruin our night.

1251
01:07:56,117 --> 01:07:58,847
Honey, you can still
do your writing thing,

1252
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,616
and now you get to do it
right here next to me.

1253
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:04,490
OK?

1254
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,528
What can I do to make
you feel better? Huh?

1255
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:11,965
What about some bathroom sex?

1256
01:08:12,033 --> 01:08:13,466
Will that do it?

1257
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:20,570
How many times
have you done that?

1258
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:23,008
Uh... You know, like three...

1259
01:08:24,412 --> 01:08:26,744
...and a half times.

1260
01:08:29,317 --> 01:08:30,944
Oh, God.

1261
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:34,455
See, that is what I really
like about you, Matt.

1262
01:08:34,522 --> 01:08:36,990
