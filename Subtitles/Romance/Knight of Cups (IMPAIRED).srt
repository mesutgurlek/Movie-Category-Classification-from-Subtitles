<i>But the soul lost its wings

<i>There it took an earthly body.</i>

104

<i>And now, while it lives in this body,</i>

105

<i>no outward sign of wings can be seen.</i>

106

<i>Yet the roots of its wings are still there.</i>

107
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,846
<i>And the nature of wings is to try to raise
the earthbound body</i>

<i>and soar with it into heaven.</i>

<i>When we see a beautiful woman, or a man...</i>

it used to know in heaven.</i>

111

So what'd we do? Said, double your quote.
And he did it.

128
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,926
And that, Chuck signed off of that.
Teddy gets who he wants.

129
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,162
The biggest comedy star wants you.

130

I picked him up and I had him
in my car, and a cop pulled us over.

I tell him, "I'm a Methodist minister
and I'm looking after you, alright?"

I tell you stuff.

<i>(Rick) I loved my brother then.</i>

210

<i>I hated him, too.</i>

211
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,963

<i>To build us back up after Billy died.</i>

213

219

220

<i>(Rick) Like a snake.</i>

<i>Find it.</i>

next week. Have you ever heard of that?</i>

323
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,129
<i>You're here for 20 seconds and then,
wham, you're out. You're in another room.</i>

324
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,841
Your wife. You're in another one.
You oughtta do that.

325
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,721
Have you been to Sarajevo?
I have prayed, man,

326
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,808
for God to take my arm, take both arms.
I felt so useless.

327
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,724
What's your name?

328
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,804

(British man) Dear friend.

332

<i>I wonder where I was in all that time.</i>

333
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,690
<i>A sleepwalker.</i>

334

<i>In love with the world,

<i>Mum The world's a swamp.</i>

<i>You have to fly over it.</i>

<i>(Nancy) You changed.</i>

344
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,330
<i>The world absorbed you.</i>

345
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,045
<i>More and more.</i>

346
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,051
<i>I regret that it turned out the way it did.</i>

347

<i>You always wanted to get away.
I wanted a mate.</i>

348
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,930
<i>I couldn't have you.</i>

349
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,563
<i>Just didn't wanna be alone.</i>

350
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,966
Are you sorry that you brought me here?

351
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,725
Are you sorry you came?

352
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,208
(Nancy) Do you remember how happy we were?
Different these days.

353
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,364
What's going on with you?

354
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,483
(Nancy) You used to sing in the morning
coming down the stairs.

355
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,769
I meant to make you happy.
I wanted nothing else.

356
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,691
But then you began to be angry with me...

357
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,644
just for little things.

358
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,529
<i>(Nancy) I don't wanna accuse you,
bu! you turned more unkind toward me.</i>

359
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,450
<i>Almost cruel.</i>

360
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,530
Just don't threaten me with leaving, okay?

361
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,370
Just do what you wanna do!

362
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,764
Just go!

<i>Ambition.</i>

<i>Fear.</i>

<i>Your head was turned

Can you move all your fingers?

384
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,360
Yeah, they look a little bit bruised.

385

(string music continues)

386
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,363
<i>(Nancy) You never really wanted
to be totally inside our marriage.</i>

387

<i>Nor outside it, either.</i>

388
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,250

<i>Afraid of life.</i>

<i>Should I tell you that?</i>

410
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,682
(agent 1) Drinking is bad.
Bu! feelings are worse.

411
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,526
Sober girls are the worst,
but so are really drunk ones.

412
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,723
The sweet spot is one xanie,

You worked long and hard

Freedom.
What are you gonna do?

423
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,207
Crawl back down because
you don't like the altitude?

I wanna make you rich.

Is there anyone you wanna sit
in a room with?

429

<i>Don't get your head

They didn't count the pros
and cons... (drowned out by noise)

446

I gave my life up for you kids.

447
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,841
It wasn't a noble sacrifice.
It was what we were supposed to do.

01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,723
to be no part of the world
nor of the things in it.

636
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,363
But my eyes are now simple,
and I'm carnal when I see beautiful women

637
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:26,206
and big cars and lots of money,
and I wanna be a part of it.

638
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,007
(Karen) I mean, who needs a bed
this big? Pretty good, huh?

639
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,685
Look at you,

640
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,568
hanging out there with your girls and your
money. Are you feeling happy?

641
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,489
- Yes.
- It makes you happy?

642
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:48,561
- (man) It depends who owns the money.
- It's my new fur. He bought it for me.

643
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,769
This man is in love with me.

644
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,649
Just some other girl.

645
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,370
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

646
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,646
<i>(Rick) And the world held up a mirror.</i>

647
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,484
(woodwind music)

648
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,210
<i>Here.</i>

649
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,324
<i>Take the things you want.</i>

650
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,330
<i>They can be yours.</i>

651
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,410
<i>Why do you hold back?</i>

652
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,481
(Karen) I thought you were dead.

653
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,964
- I can't believe I actually met Elvis.
- You never know in this town.

654
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,721
That's my move.
Do you think I'll be as famous as Elvis?

655
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,802
(woodwind music continues)

656
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,009
<i>(narrator) What a fool am I?</i>

657
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:25,403
<i>Just to fie in a stinking dungeon.</i>

658
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,567
<i>When I may as well walk a! liberty.</i>

659
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,811
<i>I have a key in my bosom called promise.</i>

660
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,650
<i>And will I am persuaded,</i>

661
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:42,364
<i>open any lock in Doubting Castle.</i>

662
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,680
<i>Though in this dark and dismal state,</i>

663
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,407
<i>he hath turned the shadow
of death into the morning,</i>

664
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:04,248
<i>(music fades out)</i>

665
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,962
(silent)

666
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,888
(ominous, unearthly tones)

667
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,645
(Rick) Go,

668
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,329
<i>Where?</i>

669
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,170
<i>Find it.</i>

670
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,522
(unearthly tones continue)

671
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:49,365
<i>How do I reach you?</i>

672
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,650
<i>Find my way there?</i>

673
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,126
(monotonous trombone-like tone)

674
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,524
<i>(Isabel) Are you afraid?</i>

675
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,687
(deep, growling tone)

676
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,727
<i>(Elizabeth) Sweetheart, my lave,</i>

677
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,646
<i>I don't feel guilty
that I've fallen in love with you.</i>

678
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:39,965
<i>I'm glad.</i>

679
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,608
<i>Grateful I still can.</i>

680
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,961
<i>(Elizabeth) You're afraid
you're making me break my vows.</i>

681
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:04,650
<i>But the vow comes out
of the love behind it.</i>

682
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,680
<i>Love's so rare that when you find it</i>

683
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:15,210
<i>you can't doubt it.</i>

684
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,490
<i>Let it go.</i>

685
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,202
(they laugh)

686
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:52,490
<i>(Christopher) I remember when
I came down out of the mountains</i>

687
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,286
<i>and I was conditioned with
being absolutely clear.</i>

688
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,965
<i>Absolutely...</i>

689
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,522
<i>if not enlightened,
at least wiser than I had been.</i>

690
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:08,600
You have to kneel in a certain way and
you have to bow at the appropriate time.

691
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:13,448
And it's all beautifully timed,
even the sound of when they announce...

692
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,045
We walked 250 miles over the mountains,

693
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,567
into Tibet area.

694
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,370
And every... couple days,

695
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,045
every 20 miles or so,

696
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,805
you knew you were
going back in history, in time...

697
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,122
(indistinct)

698
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,404
But don't forget
their life is so circumscribed.

699
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:59,169
If you're living in a cave eating nettles,
it's not so difficult to keep life simple.

700
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:05,489
You don't have honking horns and your wife
running in saying "You screwed up!"

701
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:11,164
The distractions are very few, and that's
the great attraction of the monk's life.

702
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:16,406
<i>(Christopher)
Teaching now... I only teach one thing.</i>

703
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,647
<i>I just teach this moment.</i>

704
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,006
<i>Pay attention to this moment.</i>

705
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,563
<i>And everything is there...</i>

706
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,730
<i>perfect...</i>

707
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,810
<i>and complete.</i>

708
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,405
<i>Just as it is.</i>

709
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,166
(rattling of countless marbles)

710
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,328
(Elizabeth) You're so <i>quiet.</i>

711
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,687
<i>You keep everything to yourself.</i>

712
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:25,050
<i>You have love in you.</i>

713
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,610
<i>I know it.</i>

714
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,810
<i>When I'm with you...</i>

715
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,168
<i>I forget everything else.</i>

716
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,688
<i>My husband...</i>

717
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,370
<i>my life as I knew it.</i>

721
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,530
<i>Can it be?</i>

01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,402

727
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,330
<i>(Rick) Answer me.</i>

728

<i>So this is what we are.</i>

729
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,245
<i>A fire.</i>

(music ends abruptly)

736
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,965
Open your mouth.

738
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,647
<i>(Rick) I wanna go away with you.</i>

739
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,650
<i>Marry you.</i>

740
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,526
<i>(Rick) Save what you can of your life.</i>

741
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,250
<i>Look at me.</i>

742
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,322

<i>Don't lose it all

(exhales)

756
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,529

757
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:14,126
She's like "I had four of them.
You have to get over it and stop crying."

<i>That never gets out.</i>

765
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:00,484
<i>(Joseph) Have mercy an me.</i>

766

<i>I know you have a soul.</i>

<i>by a way you cannot see.</i>

778
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:34,649
If you are unhappy, you shouldn't
take it as a mark of God's disfavor.

779
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:40,962
Just the contrary.
Might be the very sign He loves you.

780
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:45,808
He shows His love
not by helping you avoid suffering,

781
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:49,169
by sending you suffering,

782
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,530
<i>by keeping you there.</i>

783
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:01,087
To suffer binds you to something
higher than yourself,

784
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:03,288
higher than your own will.

785
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,283
Takes you from the world
