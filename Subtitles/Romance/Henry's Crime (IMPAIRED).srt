Thanks.

How was your night?

You OK?

Are you going to go with me

Sure. What time?

46
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,811
For the baby shower?

47
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,691
Right.

48
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,279
- I don't want to go.

I want Cindy and Bill to come here.

Cindy and Bill are welcome here
whenever they want.

Don't you think it's time?

54
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,759
You're talking about kids.

55
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,841
Of course I am.

56
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,640
- OK.
- "OK", you want kids?

57
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,676
I love kids.

58
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,813
Henry, do you still love me?

59
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,850
Of course I do.

60
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,394

So how you been?

- I'm OK. What's going on?
- (GROANING)

66
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,718
Ah, we got a man down here.

67
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,517
I was wondering
if we could come in for a second.

68
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,025
Joe! Joe. Come on.

- I'm sorry.

71
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,825
Come with me.
Just get right to the back.

72
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,332
- Straight back to the kitchen.
- I'm sorry.

73
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,960
- Goddamn sausages at Pinwheels.
- Yeah?

74
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,207
So, er...
we're in a bit of a bind here, Henry.

75
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,502
We got a big play-off game
in the next half-hour

00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,636
and buddy boy there's
our first baseman.

77
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,719
But as you can see,
he's not exactly game-ready.

78
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,889

- You can't be thinking nothing.

"How in hell did I get here?"

How do you think we all got here?

I don't know.

134
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,619
We committed crimes, Henry.

135
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,505
But we committed to the wrong thing.

136
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:08,419
See, that was a mistake.
We never fulfilled our potential.

137

See this guy here in the middle?

He wanted to be a doctor.

Thanks.
And he could have been a good one.

Well, good or bad, I don't know.

142
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,185
But he chose not to fulfill
his potential. Now look at him.

143
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,855
So I'm talking about bad choices.

00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,992
I recommend these potatoes.
They're really terrific.

Give him a little extra,
please, Charlie. Thank you.

is not committing to your dream.

I'm really sorry.

No.

what you did last time for the board.

- Come on, show us.

- Leave me alone, OK?

So last time, um... I'm sitting there,

182
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,170
and um... the Head of the Board
comes and says,

183
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,880
"OK, Max, what are you going to do
for us this time if we let you out?"

I get the old twitch working,

185
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,258

00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,342
- That.
- What?

325
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,933
Take a chance on life.
Take a chance on (SINGS) Buffalotto.

326
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,019
- Oh. That's you.
- Unfortunately, yeah.

327
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:56,277
Er... I mean, look,
you seem to be OK, right?

328
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,812
Yeah, I'm OK.

329
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,106
Great. So I can go now, right?

330
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,865
- Sure.
- OK, then.

331
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,776
Goodbye.

332
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,617
And, you know, be more careful.

333
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,838
(CAR HORN)

334
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,754
I told you I never wanted
to see that face again.

335
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,173
So?

336
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,176
I figured it out.

337
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,310
- Figured what out?
- My dream.

338
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,438
Oh, that's good. So what is it?

339
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,315
The bank.

340
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,943
- The bank is your dream?
- Yeah.

341
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,480
- Um... what bank?
- The one I didn't rob.

342
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,148
- That's your dream?
- Yeah.

343
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,735
What kind of
cockamamie dream is that?

344
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,281
I did the time,
I may as well have done the crime.

345
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,950
Yeah. Time, crime, right.

346
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,707
- So what do you say?
- About what?

347
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,373
- Will you help me?
- Help you what?

348
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,339
(Will you help me rob the bank?)

349
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:31,382
You came to jail to ask me
to help you rob a bank?

350
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,050
Yeah.

351
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,604
I missed you, Henry.

352
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,982
You've got your review coming up.

353
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,689
- Yeah, so?
- So you can get out of here.

354
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,774
- it's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

355
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,564
- it's not.
- It is.

356
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,700
No, it is not.
This is my home, buddy.

357
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,862
This is not a home, Max.
it's a prison.

358
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,905
Call it what you like. I'm happy here.

359
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,449
Max.

360
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,168
You can't die in this place.

361
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,295
I can die
pretty much wherever I want.

362
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,207
I'm asking for your help.

363
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,092
I need your help.

364
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,552
- I got cards, kid.
- Max.

365
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,809
Come on. Look, I've thought about...

366
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,856
# I got a thing on my mind

367
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,692
# Sure enough gonna find it

368
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,327
# I got a thing on my mind

369
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,407
# Sure enough gonna find it

370
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,252
# Don't let nobody tell me

371
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,039
# My thing, it won't come true

372
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,126
# Cos I ain't lying down

373
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,129
# Till I get my dues

374
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,716
# I got a thing on my mind

375
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,473
# I'm sure enough gonna find it... #

376
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,069
God knows, I love my country.
I love it deeply.

377
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,701
I couldn't see out of the train window,
I was crying so much.

378
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,081
(LAUGHS) But I must drink my coffee.

379
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,040
Firs, coffee. Firs?

380
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,705
Where's Firs?

381
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,919
I'm sorry, Firs is sick today.

382
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,708
- What?
- He's... He's sick.

383
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,128
He's sick. You know it. Continue.

384
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,638
Fine, I'll pretend Firs is here.

385
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,766
Thank you, Firs, you dear old man.

386
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,599
I'm so glad to find you still alive.

387
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:43,731
I said I'm so glad
to find you still alive.

388
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,562
He's a little deaf.

389
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,185
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich

390
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,947
says that I'm an upstart,
a money-grubber.

391
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:56,403
He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care. A bit.

392
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:02,329
I just want you to believe in me.
Like in the old days.

393
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,587
I just want your wonderful tender
eyes to look on me like they used to.

394
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:11,376
(RUSSIAN ACCENT) No, no, no, no, no.
Stop, stop. It just is bloody.

395
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,010
No! Simone.

396
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,675
It's too small. it's too safe.

397
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,435
- Stop showing me that safe face.
- Good, I won't.

398
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,473
No, I'm not talking about you.
You're doing the best you can.

399
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,266
I'm talking to you.

400
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,309
- What are you doing?
- Me?

401
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,898
Yes.

402
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,322
Well, l... I'm listening.

403
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:38,611
Listening?
Well, it looks like you're...

404
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,781
"hearing, and to hear is to be weak.

405
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,791
To listen is to be strong.

406
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,045
Why? Because to listen is an action.

407
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,043
No. What... What is that?

408
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,007
It's an action. I'm listening.

409
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,930
I mean, is that what you want?
Is that what you mean?

410
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:06,017
- No, Djula.
- Mm-hm. GK.

411
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,181
Then what do you want?

412
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,771
You're performing, you're performing.

413
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:15,314
Nothing comes out.
You're just performing. Performing.

414
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,982
Well, that's what I do, Derek.

415
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,526
I'm an actress.

416
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,696
You can call yourself
whatever you want,

417
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,583
but so far
you haven't shown me anything real.

418
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,118
You see, here on stage,

419
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:32,040
every moment, every word,
every breath should be a risk.

420
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:36,381
Where is your risk, Djula?

421
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,216
I don't know, Darek. In your ass?

422
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:43,426
Good! Finally she's listening! Hah!

423
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,515
From the top, everybody.

424
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,054
I'm going to grab some coffee.

425
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,315
Well, you do that, Djula.
Go and grab a coffee.

426
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:55,731
Let's all have coffee and think about
what we're willing to risk in life.

427
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:59,116
What are you doing here?
You here to sue me?

428
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,322
- No.
- Good.

429
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,283
(DAREK) 20 minutes. I don't care.

430
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,823
- Is it always like that?
- What?

431
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,616
- That.
- In rehearsal?

432
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,036
- Yeah.
- it's a process.

433
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,585
Looks complicated.

434
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,170
Yeah, it is.

435
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,389
- Madame Julie.
- Coffee, Pierre.

436

GOUNOD'S "ROMEO ET JULIETTE")

437
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,524
You want one?

438
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,355
- Sure.
- Deux.

439
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,145

- Oui.

00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,365
You looked like you were listening.

443
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:47,782
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

444
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:49,370
Really?

445
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,160
In a way.

446
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,499
Yeah. Yeah, I wasn't.

447
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,835
I wasn't. I was playing it safe.

448
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,596
You know, "The Cherry Orchard"
was Chekhov's last play.

449
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,931
He was dying when he wrote it.

450
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,892
It's kind of perfect.

451
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,149
- Why?
- Because it's my last play, too.

452
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,275
Here in Buffalo.

453
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,359
I'm leaving. Right after this.

454
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:27,071
So who are you?

455
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,114
You mean my name?

00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,409
OK.

457
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,953
I'm Henry.

Well, I wanna thank you

why you believe
we should grant you a parole.

Come on, Mr Saltzman.

464

What have you got for us this time?

00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,178
See you, George.

469

- I knew you could do it.
- Yeah.

470
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,144
Um...

471
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,983
..where is your car?

472
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,944
I don't have a car.

473
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,528
You don't have a car?

474
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,193
I sold it.

475
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,112
Well, what is the matter with you?

and you don't have a car.

That is not the way
you pick up a person!

Yes, it is. I'm here.
I'm picking you up.

Look, I really don't know about this.

480
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,963
I think I'm making
a pretty big mistake.

Look, Max,
the bus station's just a short walk.

482

Bus station?

483
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,387
Don't worry, Max.

484
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,177
Carl? Hey, Dave!

485
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,765
Let me in, will you? Open up!

486
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:16,896
Max, it's gonna be OK.

487
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,109
Are you kidding me?
This is your plan?

488
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,825
An old cartoon in a pissoir?

489
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,786
- it's a start.
- No, this is 80 years ago.

490
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:40,121
Wait. I tell you what we do.
We do it the old-fashioned way.

491
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,039
- We go in with guns.
- No guns.

492
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,253
- Why?
- Someone could get hurt.

493
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,552
That's very sweet of you, Henry.

494
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,888
Maybe the tunnel's still there, Max.

495
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,640
Yes, I'm sure it is, right (!)

496
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,927
- Maybe it is.
- Maybe it is.

497
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,848
But maybe it's not.
I tell you what we do.

498
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:02,814
First we go to this bank of yours
and see if that's there.

499
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,353
It is.

500
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,648
I'm sure it is. But maybe it's not.

501
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,503
Now, which kind of account
would you like to open?

502
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,414
Well, which kind have you got?

503
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,959
Er... savings, interest-only,
commercial...

504
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,752
Excuse me for interrupting.

505
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,341
I was just thinking,
it's such a small world.

506
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:37,011
My uncle... My uncle, he put all his
money in your vault when I was a kid.

507
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,475
I mean, after we came from Europe.

508
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,061
Before the War.

509
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,227
The brownshirts and...

510
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,566
Well, what was my point, anyway?

511
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,947
I... Yes, and I remember him,
my uncle, telling me

512
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,783
that your vault
would probably be here for 300 years.

513
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,666
- Well, we hope he's right.
- The man was never wrong.

514
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,078
Er...
how long has that vault been here?

515
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,497
Er... since 1891.

516
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:10,215
Wow. And I'm just assuming
it's in the same spot.

517
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,345
Oh, yeah, yeah. Exact same spot.

518
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,882
History, son. it's all about history.

519
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,471
As I was saying,
we have savings, interest-only...

520
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:21,639
Again, pardon me,
but you'll have to just give us

521
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:25,059
a little time to decide
which of those we prefer.

522
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,603
But I want to thank you so very much.

523
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:31,239
- Oh, well, no, thank you.
- No, thank you for being so kind.

524
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,073
OK, we'll get in touch with you.

525
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,832
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

526
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,919
The vault is somewhere in here.

527
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:54,713
The tunnel runs somewhere under here

528
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,678
and ends up somewhere in there.

529
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,308
It's virtually robbing itself,
isn't it?

530
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,936
Goddamn Chekhov shit!

531
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,602
Jesus. Henry?

532
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,645
Hi.

533
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,656
Julie, Max. Max, Julie.

534
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:15,442
How do you do?

535
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,827
- What are you doing here?
- Er...

536
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:22,742
I was er... I was just showing Henry
the place where I used to perform.

537
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,625
Oh. What?

538
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,833
- That's lunch, Julie.
- Oh. Thank God.

539
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,124
Yes,
Chekhov can be extremely difficult.

540
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,463
It sometimes takes
a cast-iron stomach.

541
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,253
- Why, you know Chekhov?
- Of course.

542
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,175
Next to Gorbachev,
he's my favourite Russian.

543
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,971
Excuse me, would you mind terribly
if I er... took a look inside?

544
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,981
It's been maybe 30 years
since I've been in there.

545
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,687
- Really?
- Yes.

546
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,187
Well, er... yeah, sure.

547
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,105
Very kind of you.

548
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,155
How are you doing?

549
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,070
Great (!) I'm in hell.

550
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,458
Home again.

551
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,710
- What shows did you do?
- Ma'am?

552
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,471
What productions were you in?

553
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,723
Ah.

554
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,850
Er... some of the greats.

555
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,137
Er... Shakespeare, of course.

556
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:29,308
Er... Ibsen, er... Yeats, Williams.

557
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,148
Yeats. Yeats?
What play did Yeats write?

558
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,564
No, it was about Yeats,
when he was a young man.

559
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,452
Julie. Excuse me. Julie,
Mary wants to fit your wig at four

560
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:43,489
and Darek says to stay hungry.

561
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:46,534
- Fuck him.
- Got it.

562
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,043
Um...
can I be a bit of a nuisance, please?

563
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:52,251
I'd very much appreciate
a small tour around the old place,

564
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,790
if you wouldn't mind.

565
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,085
He used to perform here.

566
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:59,505
- I suppose it's OK. We're on a break.
- Oh, thank you.

567
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,469
- Henry?
- Sure. Go ahead.

568
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,474
Julie, thanks so much.

569
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,098
Is that your dad?

570
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:14,486
- No, he's a friend.
- Really? Cos he seems like your dad.

571
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,949
It's peaceful out here.

572
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,706
Ah, the inner Sanctum.
Like it was yesterday.

573
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,246
Down here.

574
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,460
People often make the mistake
of going down

575
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:40,300
but in Chekhov,
you must always, always go up.

576
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,007
- Bring back some memories?
- Oh, indeed.

577
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,477
Let me tell you something.

578
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:53,563
Did you know that there used to be
a Speakeasy here during Prohibition?

579
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,729
And they hid the booze in the bank.

580
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,317
Exactly.

581
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,982
Did you know there was a tunnel?
There was a tunnel.

582
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:06,701
I know that. I know that.
As a matter of fact, that tunnel...

583
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,616
That tunnel was um...

584
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,876
I know where it is.

585
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:13,628
- I'll show it to you.
- Really?

586
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,629
- Mm-hm.
- Um...

587
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,587
You did some acting yourself,
didn't you?

588
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,673
I could tell.

589
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,258
"The Cherry Orchard".

590
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,594
So what's it about?

591
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:31,059
A woman returns to her family estate
in the Russian countryside

592
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:36,818
and she realises that she has
to sell her beloved cherry orchard,

593
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,729
which is
the magical place of her youth.

594
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,524
It's the only place
she's ever felt safe.

595
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,577
And it's about um...

596
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,073
being forced to let go of the past

597
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:56,205
and create a new life
in order to survive.

598
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,252
We're going to have to be quick

599
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,716
because Arnold hates
people in his dressing room.

600
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,597
- Arnold?
- Oh, Lopakhin.

601
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,133
Of course.

602
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,972
Hello?

603
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:15,148
And I think it was right here.

604
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,560
Yeah.

605
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:21,483
Huh. Amazing.

606
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,398
(TAPS ON HOLLOW WALL)

607
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,532
Oh, boy. Lots of whisky.

608
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,490
Filled with ladies and gentlemen.

609
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,494
The good old days. Can you imagine?

610
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,160
- (TAPS THE WALL)
- I think they sealed it up in 1931

611
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,203
when they built the theatre.

612
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,872
Yeah, times have changed.

613
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:44,670
Well, all good things
must come to an end, unfortunately.

614
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,760
So what's your story, Henry?

615
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,641
- My story?
- Like, what do you do?

616
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,347
I'm figuring that out.

617
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,888
Does that mean you don't have a job?

618
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,399
I er...

619
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,105
..just got out of prison.

620
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,691
- Prison?
- It sounds worse than it is.

621
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,824
Really? Cos prison sounds bad.

622
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:09,236
Why were you there?
Are you a murderer or something?

623
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,406
No. Do I look like one?

624
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:15,075
- No.
- What do I look like?

625
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,996
Oh, this place is
just full of treasures.

626
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:21,756
Thank you so much.
It was great. Thank you.

627
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,217
- And thank you, Simon.
- My pleasure.

628
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,720
- And I'll see you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

629
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,927
Max has offered
to volunteer at the theatre.

630
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,682
Oh.

631
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,218
Work.

632
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:37,514
Work. it's time to work,
you lazy Americans.

633
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,057
(TAPS ON STAGE)

634
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,646
Even you, Djula. Top of act two.

635
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:51,911
What are you doing afterwards?

636
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,538
- Why?
- You like Chinese?

637
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,698
- Yeah.
- Jinlan?

638
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,084
- Yeah, it's OK.
- Eight o'clock?

639
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,210
Sure.

640
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,417
- Great.
- Great.

641
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,675
Djula, can we please start?

642
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,844
Stay out of prison.

643
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,381
- Djula, please.
- Yes, yes!

644
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,265
- Can we start?
- I'm here!

645
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,802
Good. You're coming in stage right.

646
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,055
I can see it all, Henry.

647
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,644
The bank,

648
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,519
the vault, the theatre, the tunnel.

649
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,315
See,
we got all the pieces of the puzzle

650
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,279
sitting right there on the table.

651
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:33,820
Now all we gotta do
is put 'em in the right order.

652
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,081
The only thing is the dirt.

653
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,790
Where does the dirt
from the tunnel go?

654
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,545
What about the vault?

655
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:47,083
- I'm thinking dirt right now, Henry.
- OK.

656
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,465
(EXHALES)

657
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,548
How do I look?

658
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,594
- Huh?
- How do I look?

659
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,762
You look like Henry.

660
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,315
You gonna be all right?

661
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,902
Yeah, we had a great day, kid.
Have yourself a nice dinner.

662
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,478
Julie.

663
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,646
Sorry I'm late.

664
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,649
That guy's a total dick.

665
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,188
Hi, Henry.

666
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,073
Hi. So how was the rehearsal?

667
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,829
I feel like duck.

668
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,668
Yeah, I think I'm good.
The reviews are mostly good.

669
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:10,709
But the problem is I don't just
wanna be good. I wanna be great.

670
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,549
And I don't just
wanna be great in Buffalo.

671
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,798
Where, then?

672
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,384
Don't laugh.

673
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,768
Hollywood.

674
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,977
I guess that's where people go.

675
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,023
Yeah.

676
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:39,238
You know, I just don't want my legacy
to be a Buffalotto commercial.

677
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,030
You know what? it's not going to be.

678
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,666
Because the moment
this thing is done, I'm out of here.

679
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,954
I'm just... I've gotta get out
before it's too late.

680
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,586
Sounds like a plan.

681
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,376
Yeah.

682
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,265
I hate fortune cookies.

683
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:08,691
I like 'em.

684
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:20,198
Are we going anywhere in particular?

685
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,988
Mm-hm.

686
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:27,247
You want some?

687
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,378
- No.
- No?

688
00:46:29,537 --> 00:46:33,542
Come on, take a chance.
Take a chance on life.

689
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:53,607
There's a whole bunch of bodies
down there just churning around,

690
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,281
caught in the current.

691
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,588
So what did you do before jail,
Henry?

692
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,719
I worked at a tollbooth.

693
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,051
- Yeah? Which one?
- Eden.

694
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,590
'No!
'Yes.

695
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,510
Yay! I had family on the other side.

696
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,556
We must have seen
each other 100 times.

697
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,440
So, er... wow.

698
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,569
You were one of those guys
in the tollbooth with the er...

699
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,526
those weird... those rubber gloves.

700
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,156
Yeah.

701
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,827
What's so funny?

702
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,737
It's just...

703
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:47,373
You were watching everyone
go someplace

704
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,705
and you were going nowhere.

705
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,121
- That's funny?
- Yeah.

706
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,005
It's funny-sad.

707
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,215
So what did you go to jail for,
Henry?

708
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,678
- Trying to rob Buffalo Savings Bank.
- What?

709
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,096
I thought I was on my way
to a softball game but l... wasn't.

710
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,231
- But now I'm gonna rob it for real.
- What?

711
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:14,518
I'm going to rob it for real.

712
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,607
You're going to rob the bank
that you went to jail for robbing?

713
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,738
Yeah.

714
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,608
- There's a tunnel.
- What tunnel?

715
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,777
It runs from the bank to the theatre.

716
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:27,367
- My theatre?
- Yeah.

717
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,250
Fucking hilarious, Henry.

718
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,548
You know what?

719
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,959
- What?
- I'm hungry.

720
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,094
- For what?
- Ice cream.

721
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:43,880
Ice cream.

722
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,476
Let's get some ice cream.

723
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,325
I can't believe I'm sitting here.

724
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,907
Neither can I.

725
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,665
I want to dance and clap my hands.
I think I must be dreaming.

726
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,754
You know,
"God knows, I love my country.

727
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,292
"l love it deeply.

728
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,258
"l couldn't see out of the train window,
I was crying so much."

729
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,923
Page 21.

730
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:36,975
Could you read Lopakhin?

731
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,688
Sure.

732
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:47,785
"l have to go to Kharkov on the
five o'clock train. Such a bother.

733
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,616
"l wanted to stay and talk to you.

734
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,657
"You're as wonderful as ever."

735
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,575
Read the next line.

736
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,207
"Even more beautiful,

737
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,214
"and dressed like a Parisian...
You could blow me down."

738
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:05,052
Um...

739
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,179
could you say it like you feel it?

740
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,715
Like it's real.

741
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,009
Just say it to me.

742
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,852
OK.

743
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,731
"Even more beautiful.

744
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,063
"And dressed like a Parisian...

745
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,070
"You could blow me down."

746
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,487
You're good. That's really good.

747
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:36,751
You know what, I want you to keep
reading, but get up and walk around.

748
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,170
- "Your brother Leonard..."
- Leonid.

749
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,835
- Leonid.
- Leonid.

750
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:49,596
"Your brother Leonid says
I'm an upstart. A money-grubber."

751
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,053
Yes, you are, Henry.
You're a bank robber.

752
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,762
"He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care a bit.

753
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,648
"l just want you to believe in me
like in the old days."

754
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,480
Again.

755
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,103
"l just want you...

756
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:07,319
"l just want you to believe in me
like in the old days.

757
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,529
"l just want
your wonderful, tender eyes

758
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:11,410
"to look at me like they did then."

759
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,492
Say it without the book now.

760
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:25,925
"l just want
your wonderful, tender eyes

761
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,801
"to look at me

762
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,804
"like they did then."

763
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,056
Oh, I'm so glad I ran you over.

764
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,521
Me too.

765
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,760
Good morning.

766
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,885
Good morning.

767
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,446
Good morning.

768
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,629
- Henry!
- Morning, Max.

769
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:54,763
Hey, listen. I figured it out.

770
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:58,768
The dirt from the tunnel
goes on the roof.

771
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,850
Ah, company.

772
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:06,017
- Good morning, Max.
- I'm sorry about the um...

773
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,857
- it's all right. She knows.
- She does?

774
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,240
I didn't know the dirt
from the tunnel goes on the roof.

775
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:17,279
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anyone.

776
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,742
Could I just have a second with you?

777
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,375
Pardon us, will you?

778
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,458
- What do you mean, you told her?
- I told her.

779
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,592
- You told her everything?
- Yeah.

780
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,096
Henry, it's a crime.
A crime's supposed to be secret.

781
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:39,725
- it's OK, Max.
- No, it is not. It's not kosher.

782
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,808
How do you like your bacon?

783
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,479
Crispy.

784
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:56,068
- What were you in prison for, Max?
- I was a confidence man.

785
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,906
You mean a con man?

786
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,617
I um... l don't like that word.

787
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,328
Er, "confidence"
is a little more elegant.

788
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:08,291
"Confidence" comes from the Greek
"fides", meaning faith and belief.

789
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,422
Greek?

790
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,424
I thought it was Latin.

791
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,757
Well, yes, it is... it is now.

792
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:24,058
So, essentially, you make people
feel good and then you rip 'em off?

793
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,190
Yes. But I was always a little better
at the feeling good part

794
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,318
than I was with the ripping off part,
hence jail.

795
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,199
Aren't you worried
about getting caught?

796
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,156
Well, it's kind of
a win-win situation for me.

797
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,787
Why?

798
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,039
I like jail.

799
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:47,202
What about you, Henry?

800
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,744
You like jail?

801
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:50,584
No.

802
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,498
I like it out here.

803
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,587
So why would you take the risk?

804
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:58,091
Or is it the money?

805
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,426
Well, it must be the money.

806
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,601
Boy, you are a criminal.

807
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,933
You're a greedy little criminal.

808
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:10,440
Your brother Leonid says
I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.

809
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,151
But I don't care a bit.

810
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,029
I just want you to believe in me
like in the old days.

811
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:19,032
Cute! You remember. Good!

812
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,123
Excuse me.

813
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,783
- Excuse me.
- What?

814
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,328
- Um... what exactly was that?
- It was Chekhov.

815
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,039
Chekhov?

816
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:36,334
- Oh, of course. Yeah.
- We read it last night.

817
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,379
Yeah. He was so good.

818
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:43,220
- You're really good. He's a natural.
- He is.

819
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:46,636
Um... l thought you guys
were out on a date last night.

820
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,224
We were.

821
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,435
So now
going on a date is reading Chekhov?

822
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,191
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

823
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,069
I gotta get to the theatre.

824
00:55:57,563 --> 00:56:00,282
Um... excuse me. Excuse me.

825
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,486
Um... can you give me a ride
to the theatre?

826
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,039
Why?

827
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,370
I'm a volunteer now.

828
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:16,165
You were never in any of those plays,
were you?

829
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:18,584
No.

830
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,218
But can you give me a ride?

831
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:32,098
- (CRYING)
- Why didn't you listen to me? Why?

832
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:35,564
We can't turn back the clock now,
poor dear

833
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,774
Crying, crying, crying.

834
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,109
Oh, God. This is driving me crazy.

835
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:42,900
- What?
- We could be digging right now.

836
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,866
- We could?
- If we were in that dressing room.

837
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:51,660
- it's rehearsal. There are people.
- Right. Just pissing me off.

838
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,044
Well, what can we do, Max?

839
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,793
What?

840
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,429
- I got an idea.
- What?

841
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,464
What if you played Lopakhin?

842
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,350
- What?
- If you played Lopakhin,

843
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,478
we could
get into that tunnel any time.

844
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,356
They have a Lopakhin.

845
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,017
- What if they didn't?
- What do you mean?

846
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:21,610
What do I mean?
What if they didn't have a Lopakhin?

847
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,400
I can't be Lopakhin.
I'm not an actor.

848
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,160
You're not a bank robber
and you're doing that.

849
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:28,696
Max, come on.

850
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,991
- She said you were a natural.
- So?

851
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,627
So a natural is a natural.
And a natural means you can do it.

852
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:39,541
- It doesn't.
- You're gonna be Lopakhin.

853
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:43,210
- There has to be another way.
- No. This is the way.

854
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,635
- I don't know, Max.
- You want the bank, don't you?

855
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:50,096
- Yeah, I do.
- Then you're gonna be Lopakhin.

856
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,602
End of story. You're gonna be great.

857
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,604
I swear to you.

858
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,811
- it's crazy.
- You're gonna be great.

859
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,521
I'll call you back.

860
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:02,484
Darek, she's taking
a phone call in the middle...

861
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:07,152
I did not take it.
It's exactly what I did not do.

862
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,449
Listen, I was thinking here,
you could step backstage.

863
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,492
(SHOUTING>

864
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:24,210
- What's going on?
- You unprofessional...

865
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:27,220
- Mr Milodragovich.
- ..shit!

866
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,756
Arnold's quitting.

867
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,095
- What?
- He's quitting.

868
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,102
We're talking about Willie Loman.

869
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:37,561
The West End.
A Ken Waterstone production.

870
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:40,272
Ooh, a Ken Waterstone production!

871
00:58:40,434 --> 00:58:41,902
The heavens have opened (!)

872
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,483
You're a lucky boy. Well, go, yes.

873
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,866
Run, run to that
pampering, populist...

874
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,402
(SIGHS) Great (!)

00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:56,417
_.piece of shit Ken Waterstone
and his finest productions. Ha!

876
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:59,419
Goodbye, Darek. I'm sorry.

877
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,580
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo (!)

878
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,668
(SHOUTS)

879
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:11,052
We could have auditions
this afternoon.

880
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,093
- I have a list of...
- That's a shit list!

881
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,636
What do you want me to do?

882
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,930
I can't hear you when you're yelling.

883
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,993
What?

884
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,285
No, no, no, sorry.
I can't give you a ride.

885
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:38,917
I know, no. Before I start,

886
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:43,001
I just want you to remember
that you said he'd be a natural.

887
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,834
Stan, let me call you back.

888
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:50,466
- What?
- Henry.

889
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:52,472
- Henry what?
- He'd be perfect.

890
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,383
Perfect for what?

891
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,768
For Lopakhin.

892
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,476
You mean
Henry should play Lopakhin?

893
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,437
- Yes.
- What the fuck! He's not an actor!

894
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,648
Exactly. He's natural.
He'd just be playing himself.

895
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:09,031
Just give this a little thinkage.

896
01:00:09,189 --> 01:00:11,362
The man is Lopakhin.

897
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:14,199
I mean, he's a man
who's come from nothing,

898
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:18,241
he's a man who's not afraid to create
a new life, put his past behind him,

899
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,625
and he's a man in love with you.

900
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:23,003
Er... Madame Ravinsky.

901
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,788
Ranevsky.

902
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,502
- What did I say?
- Ravinsky.

903
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,338
- I did?
- it's Ranevsky.

904
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,922
That's weird. OK.

905
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:35,182
Can you maybe
get him in to see Darek?

906
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,932
What's going on here, Max? Hm?

907
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:41,062
What's going on? What are you doing?

908
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:44,646
Listen. The truth is,
you need a Lopakhin

909
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:48,233
and Lopakhin needs a dressing room.

910
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,148
You did this, didn't you?

911
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,623
OK, that... that's fair enough.

912
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,375
OK. OK.

913
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,384
Confidence man.

914
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:15,639
- Now, get out.
- I was just... I was getting out.

915
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,932
Thanks.

916
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,150
You have no training,

917
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:28,106
you've never been in a production.

918
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:29,895
You don't even know the play.

919
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,234
I've read it.
I think I know this scene.

920
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,115
Oh, you think you know? What?

921
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,948
You're a peasant, a nobody.

922
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,121
Start.

923
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:54,511
Your brother Leonid Andrevich
says I'm an ups...

924
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:59,800
How can you perform Chekhov
and not be able to say Andre-ye-vich?

925
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,264
- Say it.
- Andreyevich.

926
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,101
Good. Got the name right. Continue.

927
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:09,439
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich
says I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.

928
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:11,274
A what?

929
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:14,315
- A money-grubber.
- Really?

930
01:02:14,481 --> 01:02:15,858
Are you?

931
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:17,446
- No.
- No?

932
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:20,328
- No!
- No? But convince her, not me.

933
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:24,332
Convince her!

934
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:29,709
Your brother Leonid Andreyevich
says I'm an upstart. A money-grubber.

935
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:32,340
He can say whatever he likes.
I don't care a bit.

936
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,297
Neither do I.

937
01:02:35,669 --> 01:02:37,637
I just want you to believe in me,

938
01:02:37,796 --> 01:02:39,218
like in the old days.

939
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,055
Now, do you, Djula?

940
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:45,346
Show me. Tell me.

941
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:50,234
Yes, please can you show us
something we don't know?

942
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,987
Good God in heaven.

943
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,364
My father
was one of your father's serfs,

944
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,321
and your grandfather's serf
before that.

945
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,201
Boring!

946
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,454
It's all ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

947
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,990
It must come from here.
Speak with your heart.

948
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:08,000
She's your angel.

949
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,708
Beg her. Beg her for forgiveness.

950
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,168
(Because you're going
to destroy her life.)

951
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:18,508
(Ask her for forgiveness.)

952
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,642
My father
was one of your father's serfs,

953
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,978
and your grandfather's serf
before that.

954
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:37,276
But you, you did so much
for me in the old days.

955
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,283
I'd forgotten all that.

956
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,072
I love you.

957
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,162
Like a sister.

958
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:51,585
More than a sister.

No.

more interesting since you showed up.

You mean, since you ran me over.

- No.
- Then why are you doing it?

I didn't know I could change it.

So now I'm changing it.

Looking forward to it.

OK, let's take five minutes.
We'll go from the top of act three.

- Yeah.

We were banking on that money, Henry.

No, of course not.

I think we should get some guns and
get the money through the front door.

across the border to Canada,

1078

takes up all the currency
and brings it back home.

would rob that bank any other time.

which you're not, of course,

01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:11,410
um... why would you help us
rob your own bank?

01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:16,669
- Got my reasons.
- This sounds like a set-up, man.

have to forgive us, Frank.

all the cost so I went to the bank.

1095

cover the difference.

1097
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:49,827
We had to use all of our savings
to cover the bills.

1098
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,201
Spent everything we had.

1099

Look,
why should I be ashamed to say it?

1109
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,962
Oh. Why Should.._

1110

Why should I be ashamed to say it?
I love him. I love him.

1111
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:50,050
My love is like a stone round my neck

01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,886
and it's dragging me down
to the bottom.

1117
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,940
He's a scoundrel.
Everybody sees it but you.

1118
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,946
A petty scoundrel. A user.

1119
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:10,199
And you are what? 26 or what?

1120
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:14,237
Ah, please, please,
please, please, stop.

1121
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,701
No. Look. (GROANS)

1122
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:22,871
Djula, I can hear you
because you're acting very loudly.

1123
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:26,416
But I can't feel you.

1124
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,676
(SNIFFS)

1125
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,922
Can I ask you a question?

1126
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:36,263
- It is very personal.
- Mm-hm.

1127
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,723
Have you ever been in love?

1128
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:42,189
- Of course.
- Huh. Liar.

1129
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,850
Fuck you, Darek!

1130
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,518
Then show us!

1131
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,527
Show us what love is all about.

1132
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:50,405
How it rips you apart
and then puts you together.

1133
01:16:50,564 --> 01:16:54,660
It carries you to the heavens
and then smashes you to the ground.

1134
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,368
Now, if you want
to become a great actress,

1135
01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:00,249
then you
have to reveal something, Djula.

1136
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:03,877
What are you so afraid of, huh?

1137
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:08,166
Maybe you want to die
old, alone, unemployed.

1138
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,585
Is that what you want, hm?

1139
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,170
Djula!

1140
01:17:16,215 --> 01:17:18,013
Oh, that's right, Djula.

1141
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:22,305
Run, Buffalotto. Run.

1142
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,018
You're very good at that.

1143
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,854
Five minutes, people.

1144
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:27,393
Five minutes, everyone.

1145
01:17:30,437 --> 01:17:31,984
(SOBS)

1146
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:37,031
- (KNOCKING)
- What?

1147
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:44,456
- Are you OK?
- (WHIMPERS)

1148
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,709
I... hate him.

1149
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:53,507
I'm a good actress.
I am a damn good actress.

1150
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:57,845
What, I have to love someone
to be a great actress? Horse shit.

1151
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:04,681
I've heard it my whole goddamn life.

1152
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:07,441
- What?
- That I'm cold.

1153
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:15,983
No, you're not.

1154
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,500
Ice cold.

1155
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,964
Arctic cold.

1156
01:18:55,856 --> 01:18:58,234
Mm.

1157
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,402
This is it. I got the place.

1158
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,446
South Beach, Florida.

1159
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:03,990
Incredible.

1160
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:06,250
I'm talking palm trees,

1161
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:09,708
all-you-can-eat sunshine,
nice sandy beach,

1162
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:13,420
surrounded by grapefruits
the size of your head.

1163
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,552
Now, is that living it?
Is that living it? What?

1164
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:20,385
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, that's living it.

1165
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:23,930
- (KNOCKING)
- Who the hell's that?

1166
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:27,347
- I'll check.
- Grapefruits, Henry, grapefruits.

1167
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:30,725
Large, large grapefruits.

1168
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:34,521
- Who is it?
- it's me. Joe.

1169
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:40,151
I'm sorry, Henry.

1170
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,792
The same bank.

1171
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,626
Shit, Henry. Now, that's poetry.

1172
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,464
(GROANS)

1173
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,012
How you doin', Joe?

1174
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,547
(HE GROANS)

1175
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:03,925
Hello.

1176
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:05,843
Hello. Um...

1177
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,684
Who's this guy?

1178
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,724
I'm your new partner.

1179
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,113
- Who's this guy?
- I know the whole story.

1180
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:22,823
Joe told me you guys need someone
to help get you into that vault.

1181
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,408
And I don't dig. Dig?

1182
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:28,324
I'm sorry, Max.

1183
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:33,038
Somebody tell me,
who the hell is this guy?

1184
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:36,002
I'm in... or you're out.

1185
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:41,094
Henry, how about a cold one, huh?

1186
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,304
Let me explain something.

1187
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:49,892
This poor guy
doesn't know what he's talking about.

1188
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:52,227
He's a drunk bum.

1189
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:54,441
He makes mistakes.

1190
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,604
Drunken bums make mistakes.

1191
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:01,365
Now, you'll please
get the hell out of that chair.

1192
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,781
Henry and I go way back.

1193
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,913
We went to high school together,
right, Henry?

1194
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:11,451
- Yeah, I knew you.
- So just relax, old man.

1195
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:16,789
Max! Max, Max, it's OK. Max.

1196
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,708
- I know him. I know him.
- All right. All right.

1197
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:29,764
I appreciate
you keeping your mouth shut, Henry.

1198
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:34,933
If there's one quality
I admire in a man, it's loyalty.

1199
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,021
What do you want, Eddie?

1200
01:21:40,187 --> 01:21:42,155
The American dream.

1201
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:47,949
Deb says we can't have sex
till the baby is born.

1202
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:50,490
She says the kid'll know.

1203
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:56,208
Get the fuck out of here, Joe.
Just shut up and go home, please.

1204
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,507
So, Henry, what about that beer?

1205
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,138
Shit.

1206
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,678
Opening night.

1207
01:22:12,845 --> 01:22:14,222
Shit, What?

1208
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:17,062
- Opening night.
- Yeah, so?

1209
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:18,601
It's soon.

1210
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,735
Correct. So let's go dig it.

1211
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:23,067
I'm gonna have to leave her.

1212
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:27,906
Of course you have to leave her.
You're robbing a bank.

1213
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:29,615
Max, maybe we should wait.

1214
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,701
Wait for what? A bus?

1215
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:34,458
What are you talking about?
it's a one-time deal.

1216
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:36,368
The guy's retiring. We can't.

1217
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:38,287
What is the matter with you, anyway?

1218
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,297
Come on.

1219
01:22:56,805 --> 01:23:01,060
What?

1220
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:02,978
I can't do it.

1221
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,989
- You can't do what?
- I can't leave her, Max.

1222
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,991
Leave who? Do what?

1223
01:23:09,943 --> 01:23:12,321
- I can't do this.
- Henry.

1224
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,073
Henry, listen.

1225
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,586
You forced me out of jail to help you

1226
01:23:19,745 --> 01:23:22,123
and I'm gonna goddamn help you.

1227
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:28,838
See, I got through my whole life with
my mouth, you know, bullshitting.

1228
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:32,053
I've been nothing
but a fucking coward.

1229
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:35,595
But now I am going to do something.

1230
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:37,729
So here's the deal, Henry.

1231
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:42,146
We're gonna dig this tunnel.

1232
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,522
Then we're gonna rob the bank
and we're gonna take the money,

1233
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:50,067
we're gonna put it in a car
and then we are going to drive away.

1234
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:55,827
Do you understand, Henry?

1235
01:23:57,199 --> 01:24:01,375
Yeah.

1236
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,380
(SIMON) Henry to the stage, please.

1237
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,843
Henry to the stage.
Lopakhin to the stage.

1238
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,308
(LAUGHTER ON TELEVISION)

1239
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,234
I'll be right out.

1240
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:30,904
Take a chance on life.

1241
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,161
Take a chance on (SINGS) Buffalotto.

1242
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,163
Oh, I hate this commercial.

1243
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:43,829
- I like it.
- Why?

1244
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:46,294
You're in it.

1245
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,304
Come on. I'm starving. Let's go.

1246
01:24:54,965 --> 01:24:57,718
We have to do it opening night.

1247
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:00,888
- What?
- it's the only time we can get in.

1248
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,769
- But that's in two days.
- Yeah.

1249
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,441
So you're leaving?

1250
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,740
Yeah.

1251
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:17,404
Wow.

1252
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:20,120
Oh, wow.

1253
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,080
Fuck.

1254
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:25,121
Fuck, Henry.

1255
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,719
- I was thinking we could meet.
- What?

1256
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:35,222
I was thinking California.

1257
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:38,350
You were thinking
we could meet in California?

1258
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,226
Yeah.

1259
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:49,395
You know what?
You really are a thief, Henry.

1260
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:51,814
I mean, California?

1261
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:56,656
Why would I go anywhere with you?
You can't cross a fucking street.

1262
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,286
You wreck my play,

1263
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:00,288
you make me an accessory to a crime.

1264
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:02,791
I should call the cops
and you should go to hell.

1265
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:07,170
- I didn't know it would be this way.
- Henry, you're a bank robber.

1266
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:10,003
You're a bank robber. Henry.
You're a bank robber.

1267
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,668
Th... I mean,
you knew that you had to leave?

1268
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,713
- No.
- That's exactly what you wanted.

1269
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:20,885
- So that we could be together.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

1270
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:36,321
You know what?
We screwed a couple of times.

1271
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:38,030
Right? So what?

1272
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:43,040
- It was more than that.
- No, really, just a couple of times.

01:40:17,136 --> 01:40:19,230
(MUTTERING FROM AUDIENCE)

1433
01:40:22,475 --> 01:40:24,068
I had to come back.

1434
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:29,024
I couldn't get on the train.

1435
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:31,318
The moment I stepped on the platform,

1436
01:40:31,484 --> 01:40:34,488
the blood drained from my heart.

1437
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:38,158
I knew I would never see you again.

1438
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:43,913
What... is he doing?

1439
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:46,253
I had to come back.

1440
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:49,965
Oh, come on, Henry.
What is this? What are you doing?

1441
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:53,097
This is the only way you'll listen.

1442
01:40:53,256 --> 01:40:55,679
(SOBS)

1443
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:57,514
(WHISPERING)

1444
01:40:57,677 --> 01:41:02,274
You should have gotten on that
stupid train. You made a mistake.

1445
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:06,561
The mistake would have been leaving
and not telling you how I feel.

1446
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:11,278
Don't pretend you care!
All you care about is money!

1447
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,659
- You think it's about money?
- Yes.

1448
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:19,120
- it's never been about money.
- My sister. Everything all right?

1449
01:41:19,282 --> 01:41:21,910
- Get out!
- Don't you have a train to catch?

1450
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:24,124
Get out! Go away!

1451
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:27,917
Well, here he is,
ladies and gentlemen.

1452
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:33,555
The selfish peasant who's taken
the orchard right out from under us,

1453
01:41:33,713 --> 01:41:38,264
who's destroying it
right in front of our very eyes.

1454
01:41:38,426 --> 01:41:44,104
Sometimes
you must destroy in order to create.

1455
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:46,643
We have to let go of our pasts
in order to live.

1456
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:49,483
You are no angel.
I see what you are by your actions.

1457
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:51,818
I came back, didn't I?

1458
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:54,234
I came back for you.

1459
01:41:57,987 --> 01:41:59,830
Henry, just...

1460
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:04,581
..leave.

1461
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:06,997
Meet me in Moscow.

1462
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:11,300
Get off the fucking stage.

1463
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:18,467
What? What are you running from?
What are you afraid of?

1464
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:20,351
- I'm not afraid.
- Yes, you are.

1465
01:42:20,509 --> 01:42:25,356
- Of what, Henry? Tell me.
- You're afraid...

1466
01:42:25,514 --> 01:42:27,983
_.because I love you.

1467
01:42:32,021 --> 01:42:33,568
What?

1468
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:36,735
Meet me in Moscow.

1469
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:39,495
Tell me you'll meet me in Moscow.

1470
01:42:39,654 --> 01:42:41,406
(WOMAN) Go with him!

1471
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:43,666
(MAN) Meet him in Moscow!

1472
01:42:50,498 --> 01:42:53,251
(Henry, you're bleeding.)

1473
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:59,807
- Meet me.
- Light... lights down ten.

1474
01:42:59,965 --> 01:43:01,933
OK.

1475
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:07,398
Ten more.

1476
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,982
(Djula.)

1477
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:14,989
(Say yes.)

1478
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:20,153
Ah, fuck, Henry.

1479
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:47,729
# Let them knock upon my door

1480
01:43:51,934 --> 01:43:55,438
# Until their hands
are black and blue

1481
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:02,237
# I'm not answering for no one

1482
01:44:05,406 --> 01:44:08,876
# Until my man and I are through

1483
01:44:10,453 --> 01:44:12,797
# Ooh

1484
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:18,928
# When we 're makin' love

1485
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:23,801
# You know the world
ain't got nothing

1486
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:26,185
# Oh, nothing to do

1487
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:30,598
# Cos when we 're makin' love

1488
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:35,817
# I won't answer to nobody but you

1489
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:38,781
# Nobody but you, babe

1490
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:42,865
#I ain't gonna answer to nobody,
no, no

1491
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:48,453
# They can call me on the phone

1492
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:56,545
# But no matter
how many times that phone rings

1493
01:44:59,168 --> 01:45:02,672
# I'm not pickin' up for no one

1494
01:45:05,883 --> 01:45:09,979
# Until that fat lady sings

1495
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:13,353
# Ohh

1496
01:45:13,516 --> 01:45:19,148
# When we 're makin' love

1497
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:22,700

# Oh, yeah, yeah

1503
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:41,256
# Listen now

1504
01:45:42,086 --> 01:45:45,260
# People, they ask a lot of me

1505
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:48,926
# Always want more than
they got of me, yeah

1506
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:55,608
# Let them say I'm hard to find

1507
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:58,610
# I'll do what I got to do

1508
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:01,818

1512
