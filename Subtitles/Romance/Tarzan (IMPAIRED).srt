From this day on
now and forever more

1095
01:24:31,904 --> 01:24:36,702
Don´t listen to them
´cause what do they know

1096
01:24:36,827 --> 01:24:41,664
We need each other
to have, to hold

1097
01:24:41,789 --> 01:24:44,376
They´ll see in time

1098
01:24:46,502 --> 01:24:48,671
I know

1099
01:24:51,757 --> 01:24:56,596
When destiny calls you
you must be strong

1100
01:24:56,721 --> 01:25:01,601
I may not be with you
but you´ve got to hold on

1101
01:25:01,726 --> 01:25:06,148
They´ll see in time

1102
01:25:06,314 --> 01:25:08,984
I know

1103
01:25:09,109 --> 01:25:11,319
We´ll show them together

1104
01:25:11,485 --> 01:25:15,990
´Cause you´ll be
in my heart

1105
01:25:16,115 --> 01:25:20,494
Believe me
you´ll be in my heart

1106
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:23,957
l´ll be there
from this day on

1107
01:25:24,123 --> 01:25:29,171
Now and forever more

1108
01:25:31,088 --> 01:25:36,386
-  Oh, you´ll be in my heart
-  You´ll be here in my heart

1109
01:25:36,552 --> 01:25:41,641
No matter what they say
l´ll be with you

1110
01:25:41,807 --> 01:25:44,810
You´ll be here
in my heart

1111
01:25:44,978 --> 01:25:48,356
l´ll be there always

1112
01:25:51,193 --> 01:25:54,613
Always

1113
01:25:56,113 --> 01:25:58,908
l´ll be withyou

1114
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:04,997
Well, l´ll be there
for you always

1115
01:26:05,122 --> 01:26:08,126
Always and always

1116
01:26:10,753 --> 01:26:13,798
Just look over your shoulder

1117
01:26:15,634 --> 01:26:18,595
Just look over your shoulder

1118
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:24,016
Just look over your shoulder

1119
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:28,604
l´ll be there always

1120
01:26:38,407 --> 01:26:42,578
Put your faith
in what you most believe in

1121
01:26:42,703 --> 01:26:46,539
Two worlds
One family

1122
01:26:46,707 --> 01:26:50,711
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

1123
01:26:50,877 --> 01:26:55,716
Toguide these lives we see

1124
01:26:55,882 --> 01:27:00,052
A paradise
un touched by man

1125
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:03,431
Within this world
blessed with love

1126
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:08,979
A simple life
They live in peace

1127
01:27:09,104 --> 01:27:12,774
Raise your head up
Lift high the load

1128
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:16,944
Take strength
from those that need you

1129
01:27:17,069 --> 01:27:21,240
Build high the walls
Build strong the beams

1130
01:27:21,365 --> 01:27:23,452
A new life is waiting

1131
01:27:23,577 --> 01:27:27,413
But danger´s
no stranger here

1132
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:43,596
No words describe
a mother´s tears

1133
01:27:43,764 --> 01:27:47,141
No words can heal
a broken heart

1134
01:27:48,726 --> 01:27:52,605
A dream isgone
But where there´s hope

1135
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:56,818
Some where something
is calling for you

1136
01:27:56,944 --> 01:28:00,738
Two worlds
One family

1137
01:28:00,863 --> 01:28:04,868
Trust your heart
Let fate decide

1138
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:09,831
Toguide these lives we see
