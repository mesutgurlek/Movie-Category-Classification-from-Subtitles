00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,060
[Chattering]

2
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,202
Thank you.

3
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,634
Hall.

4
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,712
<i>Come here, please.</i>

5
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,584
<i>- Sir?</i>
- Come on.

6
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,720
Have a good send-off?

7
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,722
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

8
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,724
Mr. Abrahams gave me a picture...

9
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,987
<i>The Light of the World.</i>

10
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,063
The fellas have given me a set of Guatemalas.

11
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,358
Up to two dollars!

12
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,832
The ones with the parrot
and the pillar on.

13
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,460
Look, sir.

14
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,904
Oh, splendid, splendid.

15
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:51,443
And, um, what did Mr. Abrahams say to you?

16
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,705
Told you you were a miserable sinner, I hope.

17
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,713
[Chuckles]

18
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,840
Mr. Abrahams said I'm never to do anything...

19
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,215
I'd be ashamed to do
in front of my mother.

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,220
He said my next school...

21
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,222
will be more like the world.

22
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,259
Did he? Did he?

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,591
What's the world like, do you suppose?

24
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:13,097
Don't know, sir. I'm a boy.

25
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,929
Do you, um, have
any older brothers, Hall?

26
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,935
No, sir. Only Kitty and Ada.

27
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,937
They're my sisters, sir.

28
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,404
No uncles?

29
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,702
No, sir.

30
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,404
There's Dr. Barry.
He knew my father before he died.

31
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:30,313
So you don't really know
a-a great many grown-up fellows.

32
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,316
No, not really, sir.

33
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,318
Mother keeps a coachman...

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,320
and George for the garden.

35
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,322
But of course, you mean gentlemen.

36
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,791
Hall, I'm going to talk to you
for a few moments...

37
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,954
as if I were your father.

38
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,429
It isn't anything your mother could say.

39
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,501
Do you... Do you see?

40
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,593
Your body...

41
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:56,107
is about to experience
various changes.

42
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,177
Physical changes.

43
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:01,441
Now, Mr. Abrahams has explained
to you that in the beginning...

44
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,914
"...God created he
man and woman...

45
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,076
that the earth
should be peopled abundantly."

46
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,154
Yes, sir. Sir...

47
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,517
what changes?

48
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:18,062
I speak, Hall...

49
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,395
of the sacred mystery of sex...

50
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,435
the act of procreation...

51
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,470
<i>between a man and his wife.</i>

52
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,699
<i>The... The procreation indeed...</i>

53
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,742
<i>of all creeping things.</i>

54
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,542
You will discover...

55
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,344
that your <i>membrum virilis...</i>

56
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:42,444
- That's Latin from <i>vir.</i>
<i>- Vir,</i> sir. It means man, sir.

57
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,319
Very good. Very good.
Um, uh, look.

58
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,394
Uh, this might be easier if I...

59
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,967
That. That... That, um...
That thing.

60
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,594
There. Now, that will...

61
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:03,542
develop and grow larger.

62
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,611
You see?

63
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,907
<i>And when that happens...</i>

64
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:11,916
<i>the man lies</i>
<i>very, very close to his wife...</i>

65
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:16,478
and he puts his <i>membrum virilis...</i>

66
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,615
into her vagina...

67
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,626
<i>thus.</i>

68
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,289
<i>Then, in due course,</i>
<i>she will bring forth his child.</i>

69
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,389
Seminiferous tubules...

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,231
<i>labia major and minor, ducts...</i>

71
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,674
vulva.

72
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,904
<i>That... That is</i>
<i>the very crown oflife, Hall.</i>

73
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,451
God's wondrous purpose.

74
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,680
<i>Your body is his temple.</i>

75
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,556
You must never, ever
pollute that temple.

76
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,926
And when,
as one day I... I'm sure you will...

77
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,000
you fall in love and marry,
you will discover...

78
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,127
to serve and protect a woman...

79
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,263
and have children by her...

80
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:11,002
is life's chiefest glory.

81
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,544
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,343
You must never, ever mention
any of this to your mother...

83
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,509
or... or... or indeed to any lady.

84
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,985
And if at your next school
the fellows mention it...

85
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,988
just shut them up.

86
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,990
Tell them you know.

87
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,060
I think I shan't marry.

88
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,857
What?
[Laughs]

89
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:34,558
Look, um, in 10 years to the day...

90
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,603
I invite you and your wife to dine
with me and my wife as our guests.

91
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,673
- What do you say?
- Oh, sir.

92
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,264
Yes. It's a bargain then, is it?
[Laughs]

93
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:50,147
[Grunts]
Oh, God. Those infernal designs.

94
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:57,385
Sir, won't they be all right?
The tide will have covered them by now.

95
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,925
[Sighs]

96
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,018
Oh, yes, the rising tide.

97
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,927
<i>I only hope to God he's right...</i>

98
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,660
<i>by God.</i>

99
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,105
[Gasps] Come, Victoria. Come.

100
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,072
<i>[Man] Wagner's utter rubbish.</i>
<i>Fat women with horns on their heads...</i>

101
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,048
<i>singing at the tops of their voices...</i>

102
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,050
<i>about how happy they are to be dying.</i>

103
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,052
<i>It's a horrible noise. And it's unhealthy.</i>

104
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,384
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>But music is about death. It always has been.</i>

105
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,390
<i>[Man #1] I think he's trying to provoke us.</i>

106
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,426
<i>Go on then, Risley. Enlighten us.</i>

107
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,087
<i>[Risley]</i>
<i>A superior mind wouldn't need enlightening.</i>

108
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,063
<i>Music is the highest of the arts.</i>

109
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,498
<i>It needs no reference to the figurative...</i>

110
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,502
or the corporeal.

111
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,869
It is therefore, of all the arts,
the closest to death.

112
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,943
Wagner's by no means unhealthy.

113
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,035
He's merely expressing
most exactly the state of things.

114
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,878
<i>[Man] Help yourselves to potatoes, Hall.</i>
<i>Don't stand on ceremony.</i>

115
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,077
I can't stand music.

116
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,587
Or concert halls.
I don't go in for being superior.

117
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,149
- Don't you? I do.
- Come along, Chapman. You're in need of food.

118
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,821
I expect Lord Risley isn't.

119
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,989
I've put him off with my low talk.

120
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,436
I simply can't think of a reply to that.

121
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,006
<i>What about saying nothing?</i>

122
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,132
Say nothing? Horrible.

123
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,267
He must be mad.

124
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,778
<i>[Man] What you do</i>
<i>is more important than what you say.</i>

125
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,411
Your deeds are more important
than your words.

126
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,749
<i>What is the difference?</i>
<i>Words</i> are <i>deeds.</i>

127
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,119
Are you trying to say
that these few minutes talking...

128
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,249
in the dean's rooms
have done nothing for you?

129
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,789
Will you, for instance,
ever forget that you've met me?

130
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:49,629
- [Laughing]
- You're confusing what is important...

131
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,499
with what is impressive.

132
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,268
Chapman and Hall will always remember
they've met you. Of that I have no doubt.

133
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,366
Exactly. Because of my conversation.

134
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,447
Oh, they'll forget that they were engaged
in the act of eating a cutlet.

135
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,643
At least the cutlet does some good to them.
You do not.

136
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:10,279
I mean, Dean, that a cutlet
merely influences their subconscious life.

137
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,653
I, by my words,
shape the consciousness.

138
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:16,159
<i>I am therefore not only</i>
<i>more impressive than the cutlet...</i>

139
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,628
but infinitely more important.

140
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,727
Your dean here dwells in superstitious clouds
of Christian self-righteousness.

141
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,364
Your dean pretends that
only insensate faith is of any significance.

142
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,807
<i>And daily he droops,</i>
<i>soporific, into his soup.</i>

143
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:35,677
Oh, Risley, shut up.
Come on.

144
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,215
I think if a man has ideas like that...

145
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,751
he should have the courtesy
to keep them to himself.

146
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,879
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>On the contrary, one must talk, talk, talk.</i>

147
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,153
<i>It's only by talking</i>
<i>that we shall caper upon the summit.</i>

148
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,854
Otherwise the mountains
will overshadow us.

149
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,861
<i>I'm sure, Hall, you will agree.</i>

150
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,573
Wait.

151
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,905
I'm eager to hear
more of your interesting ideas...

152
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,005
about words and deeds.

153
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,041
My rooms are in Trinity.

154
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,246
And I have a dining club
whose members would...

155
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,550
if I'm not mistaken, interest you.

156
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,328
No need to bring your chum.

157
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,432
Oh, well...

158
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,270
You're not going, are you?

757

1204
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:57,693
<i>I offered him five shillings,</i>
<i>but he wouldn't take it, damn cheek.</i>

1205
01:28:57,799 --> 01:29:01,633
Best of luck.
I'm so glad you're not really horrible.

1206
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:04,330
<i>- [Hall] Are you?</i>
<i>- [Pippa] Good-bye, dear Maurice.</i>

1207
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:07,670
<i>Good-bye.</i>
<i>You gave him more, I suppose.</i>

1208
01:29:09,877 --> 01:29:13,836
Five shillings not good enough?
You'll only take gold?

1209
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:26,350
I'll take it.

1210
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:32,866
<i>- Clive.</i>
- You're coming back very soon.

1211
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:34,901
- Good luck.
- Thanks, old man.

1212
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:38,938
Cheerio, old man.

1213
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,974
- Archie, good-bye.
- [Anne] Good-bye.

1214
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,212
Thank you, Simcox.

1215
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:48,215
- [Anne] Good-bye.
- [Durham] Bye, Maurice.

1216
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:50,284
- Good-bye.
- [Archie] See you soon.

1217
01:29:51,786 --> 01:29:54,152
- Bye, Maurice.
- Good-bye.

1218
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:59,653
I do wish I knew the girl's name.

1219
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:17,341
You're not quite off yet, I think.

1220
01:30:22,116 --> 01:30:24,050
No, I'm not.

1221
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:39,690
I'm nearer off now.

1222
01:30:42,403 --> 01:30:44,303
Hmm.

1223
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:58,808
How do you like
my consulting room?

1224
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:06,321
- It's a nice room.
- Not too dark.

1225
01:31:06,427 --> 01:31:08,395
Rather dark.

1226
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:12,998
You can see the picture
on the wall ahead of you?

1227

Mr. Hall.

1229

Take care of that crack
in the carpet, though.

1230
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,248
How broad is the crack?

1231
01:31:28,349 --> 01:31:30,817
You can jump it.

1232
01:31:37,625 --> 01:31:39,855
Admirable.

1233
01:31:41,662 --> 01:31:44,688
Now, what do you suppose
this picture is of?

1234
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:48,030

01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:58,734
Miss Edna May.

1237
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:07,878
I want to go home to my mother.

Miss Edna May is beautiful.

1240
01:32:16,597 --> 01:32:19,464
She is attractive.

1241
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:23,867
- She's not attractive to me.
<i>- What an ungallant remark.</i>

1242
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:27,400
Oh...

01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:29,499
Mr. Hall...

1244
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:33,970
Iook at her lovely hair.

1245
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:38,378
I like short hair best.

1246
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:40,852
<i>Why?</i>

1247
01:32:42,924 --> 01:32:44,892
Because...

1248
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,758

[Crying]

<i>Did it get anywhere near?</i>

1251
01:33:11,852 --> 01:33:16,915
You're open to suggestion.
I made you see a picture on the bare wall.

1252
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:22,162
I'd... I'd like another appointment.

1253
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:25,264
Telephone me in two weeks.

1254
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:28,164
In the meantime, uh,
take exercise in moderation.

1255
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:32,763
A little tennis,
stroll around with a gun.

1256
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,980
Go back to the country.

1257
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:46,918
It... It seems rather foolish
to make that journey twice in one day.

[Chattering]

1259

Hale fellow!
[Chuckles]

1260
01:34:05,773 --> 01:34:08,071
Good Lord.
You did rush back. What a shame.

1261
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:11,440
We're just off electioneering overnight.
I'm sorry. I... I had no idea.

1262
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:18,841
But I understood distinctly from you
that all your servants had been confirmed.

1263
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:22,912
I thought so.
I did think so, Mr. Borenius.

1264
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:28,819
The trouble is, Mrs. Durham,
that even if the bishop can be prevailed upon...

1265
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:32,126
- I have not time to prepare him before he sails.
<i>- [Door Opens]</i>

- Mr. Hall.
- Ah, Mr. Hall.

01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,465
<i>[Mrs. Durham]</i>
<i>Simcox informed us that you'd returned.</i>

<i>Did you have a successful trip?</i>

1269
01:34:40,307 --> 01:34:42,104
That remains to be seen.

Ah.

1271
01:34:44,211 --> 01:34:47,772

Pardon me, sir. Um, will the gentleman
be shooting tomorrow?

1274
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:17,369
I don't think so.
Obviously not, it's the cricket match.

1275
01:35:17,478 --> 01:35:22,177
I'm sure, sir, I'm very sorry if I failed
to give you and Mr. London full satisfaction, sir.

1276
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:24,183
That's all right, Scudder.

1277
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:30,247
Glad to see you
down again so soon, sir.

1278
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:33,917
That's all right, Scudder.

1279
01:35:36,597 --> 01:35:40,294
<i>[Mrs. Durham]</i>

Excuse me, sir.

The underkeeper wonders
whether you have orders.

1285
01:35:58,252 --> 01:36:00,652
I saw him before dinner, Simcox.
Nothing, thanks.

1286
01:36:00,755 --> 01:36:02,916
Tomorrow's the match.
I did tell him.

1287
01:36:03,023 --> 01:36:06,925
He wonders whether the gentleman wished
to bathe between innings, sir.

1288
01:36:07,027 --> 01:36:08,995
He's just bailed out the boat.

Very good, sir.

Good night.

Well, good luck to you.

Seems rather strange.

01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:56,699
- The Argentine, I understand.
- That's right, sir.

1299
01:36:57,845 --> 01:37:00,541
Have you ever visited it yourself, sir?

1300

[Chuckling]
No. No. England for me.

Only Mr. Hall's pleasure to wait upon.

02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:58,932
When the nations went a-whoring,
they invariably ended up by denying God.

1654
02:07:59,038 --> 02:08:01,871
Until all sexual irregularities,
and not some of them, are penal...

1655
02:08:01,974 --> 02:08:04,807
the church will never again
reconquer England.

1656
02:08:04,910 --> 02:08:07,037
I have reason to believe...

1657
02:08:07,146 --> 02:08:11,310
Scudder spent
Tuesday night... in London...

1658
02:08:13,018 --> 02:08:14,986
fornicating.

1659
02:08:16,989 --> 02:08:21,722
I'm telling you all this
because of your charitable interest in him.

1660
02:08:21,827 --> 02:08:23,988
<i>[Bell Clanging]</i>

1661
02:08:24,096 --> 02:08:27,122
- But surely he wouldn't have missed his train.
<i>- [Whistle Blowing]</i>

1662
02:08:27,232 --> 02:08:31,032
- Well, they wouldn't leave without him.
<i>- [Frederick] He's late.</i>

1663
02:08:31,136 --> 02:08:33,661
He's bloody well missed
his bleeding train!

1664
02:08:33,772 --> 02:08:35,933
Gentlemen! Gentlemen.

1665
02:08:37,743 --> 02:08:39,870
Gentlemen, I do assure you...

1666
02:08:39,978 --> 02:08:43,709
<i>Mr. Scudder was booked for a passage.</i>

1667
02:08:43,816 --> 02:08:46,785
But his kit's aboard.
His kit's aboard.

1668
02:09:38,604 --> 02:09:40,572
[Chattering]

1669
02:09:49,815 --> 02:09:52,147
Clive.

1670
02:09:52,251 --> 02:09:54,617
Don't tell Anne I'm here.
I've only a few minutes.

1671
02:09:57,923 --> 02:10:00,391
I mean...
Look here, man, that's fantastic.

1672
02:10:00,492 --> 02:10:03,256
<i>She'll be furious</i>
<i>if you don't stay the night.</i>

1673
02:10:03,362 --> 02:10:05,455
Maurice, I hope nothing's wrong.

1674
02:10:05,564 --> 02:10:08,226
[Chuckles]
Pretty well everything.

1675
02:10:09,935 --> 02:10:11,903
You'd think so.

1676
02:10:32,491 --> 02:10:35,949
Very well. I'm at your service.

1677
02:10:36,061 --> 02:10:40,293
My advice, though, is to sleep here tonight
and ask Anne in the morning.

1678
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:44,233
Where a woman is in question,
it's always better to ask another woman...

1679
02:10:44,336 --> 02:10:46,998
and particularly if she has
Anne's almost uncanny insight.

1680
02:10:47,105 --> 02:10:49,369
I'm not here to see Anne.

1681
02:10:49,474 --> 02:10:52,068
Or you, Clive.
It's miles worse for you.

1682
02:10:53,545 --> 02:10:55,775
I'm in love with Alec Scudder.

1683
02:11:00,953 --> 02:11:03,353
What a grotesque announcement.

1684
02:11:08,327 --> 02:11:10,318
Most grotesque.

1685
02:11:10,429 --> 02:11:12,454
- But I felt I ought to tell you.
- Maurice...

1686
02:11:12,564 --> 02:11:15,795
Maurice, we did everything we could
when you and I thrashed out the subject.

1687
02:11:15,901 --> 02:11:19,302
- When you brought yourself to kiss my hand.
- Don't allude to that.

1688
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:24,775
Come in here.

1689
02:11:28,347 --> 02:11:31,248
I'm more sorry for you
than I can possibly say.

1690
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:35,719
And I do, do beg you to resist
the return of this obsession.

1691
02:11:35,821 --> 02:11:37,721
I don't need advice.

1692
02:11:37,823 --> 02:11:41,816
I'm flesh and blood, Clive,
if you'll condescend to such low things.

1693
02:11:43,929 --> 02:11:45,920
I've shared with Alec.

1694
02:11:47,132 --> 02:11:49,123
Shared... Shared what?

1695
02:11:50,168 --> 02:11:52,136
Everything.

1696
02:11:53,305 --> 02:11:56,468
Alec slept with me in the Russet Room
when you and Anne were away.

1697
02:11:56,575 --> 02:11:58,475
Oh, good God.

1698
02:12:00,946 --> 02:12:03,414
Also in town.

1699
02:12:03,515 --> 02:12:08,578
The sole excuse for any relationship between
two men is that it remain purely platonic.

1700
02:12:08,687 --> 02:12:12,487
- Surely we agreed that.
- I don't know.

1701
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:14,957
I've come to tell you what I did.

1702
02:12:15,994 --> 02:12:21,830
Well, Alec... Scudder... is in point of fact
no longer in my service.

1703
02:12:21,934 --> 02:12:26,030
In fact, he's no longer in England.
He sailed for Buenos Aires this very day.

1704
02:12:26,138 --> 02:12:30,165
He didn't.
He sacrificed his career for my sake...

1705
02:12:30,275 --> 02:12:32,971
without a guarantee.

1706
02:12:33,078 --> 02:12:36,070
I don't know whether
that's platonic of him or not...

1707
02:12:36,181 --> 02:12:38,877
but it's what he did.

1708
02:12:38,984 --> 02:12:41,384
Scudder missed his boat?

1709
02:12:43,155 --> 02:12:45,248
Maurice, you're going mad.

1710
02:12:45,357 --> 02:12:49,088
- May I ask if you intend to pursue...
- No. No, you may not ask.

1711
02:12:49,194 --> 02:12:51,788
I'll tell you everything up to this minute.
Not a word beyond.

1712
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:08,402
<i>[Bird Squawking]</i>

1713
02:13:25,731 --> 02:13:27,631
Alec?

1714
02:13:55,227 --> 02:13:57,195
<i>[Water Drips]</i>

1715
02:14:10,142 --> 02:14:12,042
Alec.

1716
02:14:14,579 --> 02:14:16,979
So you got the wire, then?

1717
02:14:17,082 --> 02:14:19,573
What wire?

1718
02:14:19,684 --> 02:14:22,050
The wire I sent to your house...

1719
02:14:24,356 --> 02:14:26,347
telling you...

1720
02:14:26,458 --> 02:14:28,392
Oh, sorry.

1721
02:14:28,493 --> 02:14:30,484
I'm a bit tired,
what with one thing and another.

1722
02:14:33,598 --> 02:14:35,498
No. Telling you to come here...

1723
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:37,932
to the boathouse
at Pendersleigh without fail.

1724
02:14:51,983 --> 02:14:54,781
[Whispering]
Now we shan't never be parted.

1725
02:14:54,886 --> 02:14:56,854
It's finished.

1726
02:15:24,316 --> 02:15:26,284
Will that be all, sir?

1727
02:15:26,384 --> 02:15:28,284
Yes. Thank you, Simcox.

1728
02:15:28,386 --> 02:15:30,411
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1729
02:16:45,330 --> 02:16:47,298
<i>Come on!</i>

1730
02:17:02,013 --> 02:17:04,208
Who were you talking to?

1731
02:17:04,316 --> 02:17:06,648
[Chuckles]
No one. No one.

1732
02:17:06,751 --> 02:17:09,049
I was just trying out a speech.
