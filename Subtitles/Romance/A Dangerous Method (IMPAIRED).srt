51

What's odd is, that case
I was writing up last week,

52
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,086
I happened to pick
the code name "Sabina S."

53
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,547
And here she is,
Sabina Spielrein.

54
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,758
Quite a coincidence.

55
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,803
As you know, I don't believe
there is such a thing.

56

a very Russian name.

No, Jewish.

The one you've been looking for.

64
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,830
For your experimental treatment,
the talking cure.

70
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:49,767
What I don't understand
is why Freud,

71
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,729
having proposed this
radical therapeutic idea,

72
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,399
this talking cure,
this psychanalysis,

73
00:05:56,566 --> 00:06:00,862
then lets years go by without giving
an outline of his clinical procedures.

74
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:02,155
What's he playing at?

75
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,324
Presumably he uses
the method on his patients.

76

No idea.

77
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,163
So might you be
the first doctor to try this out?

78

It's possible.

As it happens,

82

Spielrein's mother wanted
to take her to see Freud.

83
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:26,512
Another coincidence.

84
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,851
My father thinks my mother
doesn't love him.

I was an exceptional person.

he always spoke in German.

93

00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:15,218
I dreamed about a horse

379
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:19,723
being hoisted by cables
to a considerable height.

380
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,268
Suddenly a cable breaks, and the
horse is dashed to the ground.

But it's not hurt.

it's obliged to drag along the ground.

Then a rider on a small horse
appears in front of it

385
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,241
so that it's forced to slow down.

I think Freud's
obsession with sex

probably has a great deal to do
with the fact that he never gets any.

true perversity of the human race

that one of its very few
reliably pleasurable activities

should be the subject of
so much hysteria and repression.

549
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,604
But not to repress yourself

550
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:38,484
is to unleash all kinds of
dangerous and destructive forces.

Our job is to make our patients

She was resolutely suicidal.

I just explained how she could do it
without botching it.

555

Then I asked her if she didn't prefer
the idea of becoming my lover.

can only be arrived at

through what is conventionally
thought of as sin. Right?

When my father brought me

Explain this analogy you make

between the sex instinct
and the death instinct.

1017
01:13:34,787 --> 01:13:37,873
Professor Freud
claims that the sexual drive

1018
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,876
arises from a simple urge
towards pleasure.

1019

If he's right, the question is:

1020
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:45,506
Why is this urge so often
successfully repressed?

1021
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:48,884
You had a theory involving
the impulse towards destruction

1022
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:52,054
and self-destruction,
losing oneself.

01:13:52,638 --> 01:13:56,391
Well, suppose we think
of sexuality as fusion.

1024
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:59,812
Losing oneself, as you say,
but losing oneself in the other.

1025
01:13:59,978 --> 01:14:03,273
In other words, destroying
one's own individuality.

1026
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,277
Wouldn't the ego, in self-defense,
automatically resist that impulse?

01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:10,614
For selfish, not for social reasons?
Yes.

I'm saying that perhaps true sexuality
demands the destruction of the ego.

Yes, at the same time
