00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:09,485
- Oh, my name's Fiona.
- Um, I'm Gerald.

164
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,237
- What do you do?
- I'm training to be a priest.

165
00:14:14,327 --> 00:14:16,204
Good Lord.

166
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:19,281
- Do you do weddings?
- No. No, not yet.

167
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,961
I will, of course. Jolly nerve-racking.

168
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:25,244
Yes, rather like the first time one has sex.

169
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:28,797
Um... W-well, I suppose so.

170
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:33,165
Though rather less messy, of course,
and far less call for condoms.

171
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,238
(giggles nervously)

172
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,000
How're you doing?

173
00:14:44,087 --> 00:14:47,159
Remember the time
you started Dad's boat...

174
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:49,477
..and the propeller
cut my leg to shreds?

175
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,159
This is worse.

176
00:14:56,047 --> 00:15:00,279
- Who's that boy over there in the grey?
- Uh, his name's David.

177
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:03,202
Something of a dish, isn't he?

178
00:15:03,287 --> 00:15:05,437
Well, I've always thought so.

179
00:15:05,527 --> 00:15:08,200
- Why are they, um...?
_ The dish can't hear.

180
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,359
Oh... Gosh.

181
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:13,438
Yeah, silent...

182
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:15,722
..but deadly attractive.

183
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,358
Bang, bang, bang. That's it.

184
00:15:18,447 --> 00:15:21,166
Into the marquee, please.
Dinner is served.

185
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,560
- How do you do?
- Hello. Tom. Splendid to meet you.

186
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:29,638
Very exciting.

187
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:42,560
Hi.

188
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:48,397
My name's Scarlett. Don't let me
drink too much cos I'll get really flirty.

189
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:54,484
- How do you do? My name's Charles.
_ Don't be ridiculous!

190
00:15:54,567 --> 00:16:00,005
- Charles died 20 years ago.
- Must be a different Charles, I think.

191
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:02,396
Are you telling me
I don't know my own brother?

192
00:16:02,487 --> 00:16:03,363
No, no.

193
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:23,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to drag you from your desserts.

194
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:27,120
There are just one or two little things
I feel I should say, as best man.

195
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:31,917
This is only the second time I've been
a best man. I hope I did OK that time.

196
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:35,238
The couple in question
are at least still talking to me.

197
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,680
(laughter)

198
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:40,521
U-unfortunately, they're not
actually talking to each other.

199
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:43,917
The divorce came through
a couple of months ago.

200
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:49,202
But I'm assured it had
absolutely nothing to do with me.

201
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:54,805
Paula knew Piers had slept with her sister
before I mentioned it in the speech.

202
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:59,443
The fact that he'd slept with her mother
came as a surprise,...

203
00:16:59,527 --> 00:17:04,647
..but, um, I think, was incidental
to the nightmare of recrimination...

204
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:07,002
..and, um... violence...

205
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:09,920
..that became their two-day marriage.

206
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:13,204
Anyway, enough of that!
My job today is to talk about Angus.

207
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:16,006
There are no skeletons in his cupboard.

208
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:19,443
- Or so I thought!
- (guests) Ooh!

209
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:23,406
I'll come on to that in a minute.
I would just like to say this.

210
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:24,920
Um...

211
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,246
I am,...

212
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:34,960
..as ever, in bewildered awe of anyone
who makes this kind of commitment...

213
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:38,039
..that Angus and Laura have made today.

214
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:41,524
I know I couldn't do it and, uh...

215
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:44,519
..I think it's wonderful they can.

216
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,724
- So, back to Angus and those sheep!
- (laughter)

217
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:51,078
(applause)

218
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:54,565
So, ladies and gentlemen,
if you'd raise your glasses.

219
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:57,036
The adorable couple.

220
00:17:57,127 --> 00:17:59,880
(all) The adorable couple.

221
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:02,162
The adorable couple.

222
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:04,878
(cheering)

223
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:10,318
(# band strikes up)

224
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:24,760
# I remember when rock was young

225
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:27,486
# Me and Susie had so much fun

226
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,798
# Holding hands and skimming stones

227
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:33,845
# Had an old gold Chevy
and a place of my own

228
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:36,600
# But the biggest kick I ever got

229
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:39,838
# Was doing a thing
called the Crocodile Rock

230
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:42,805
# While the other kids
were rockin' round the clock

231
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:46,562
# We were hoppin' and boppin'
to the Crocodile Rock, well...

232
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:48,877
# From outer space

233
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:52,721
# I just walked in and found you here
with that sad look upon your face

234
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,559
# I should have changed that stupid lock

235
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:56,717
# I should have made you leave the key

236
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:58,365
# I should have known for just one second

237
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:00,563
# You'd be back to bother me...

238
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:03,081
I remember the first time
I saw Gareth dancing.

239
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:05,556
I feared lives would be lost!

240
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:10,879
She's a pretty girl...
the one you can't take your eyes off.

241
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,606
Is it love at first sight?

242
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:16,804
Oh, good Lord, no!
It's the bloke she's dancing with.

243
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:21,642
I played rugby with him at school.
I'm wondering what position he played.

244
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:25,560
Though, let's say,
for the sake of argument,...

245
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:28,878
..one did take a fancy
to someone at a wedding.

246
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,879
Do you think there really
are people who can say...

247
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,596
.."Hi, babe. My name's Charles.
This is your lucky night"?

248
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:39,764
- Well, if there are, they're not English.
_ Quite.

249
00:19:41,287 --> 00:19:44,597
Three weeks is about
my question-popping minimum.

250
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:49,162
You know I love you, Jean, don't you?
I love you. I love you.

251
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:52,520
And, Mike, I've never met you before,...

252
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:54,996
..but I love you very much. I really do.

253
00:19:56,727 --> 00:19:59,400
Ignore her. She's drunk.

254
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:03,082
At least I hope she is.
Otherwise, I'm in real trouble.

255
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:08,326
- How's it going, Lyds?
- Bloody awful.

256
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,285
Oh, dear! What's the prob?

257
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:14,518
I was promised sex. Everybody said it.

258
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:18,486
"You be a bridesmaid, you'll get sex.
You'll be fighting them off."

259
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:22,162
But not so much as a tongue in sight.

260
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:27,124
Well, I mean, if you fancy... anything,...

261
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:31,283
-..I could always...
- Oh, don't be ridiculous, Bernard.

262
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:34,598
- I'm not that desperate.
- No, right. Of course.

263
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,963
Fair enough. It's a good point.

264
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:40,038
(cheering)

265
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:46,799
Whoo_hoo!

266
00:20:50,287 --> 00:20:51,402
(baas)

267
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:55,201
(Laura) Bye!

268
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,606
(car horn)

269
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:59,997
Have a lovely, lovely time! Bye!

270
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,922
# Love is all around me

271
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:16,560
# And so the feeling grows

272
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:24,203
# It's written on the wind

273
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:27,438
# It's everywhere I go...

274
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:32,442
Where are you staying tonight, Charles?

275
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:35,439
Oh, um... Scarlett and I are at some pub.

276
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:39,236
The Lucky Boat, something like that.
Aren't we all?

277
00:21:39,327 --> 00:21:42,364
Ah, no. Slight change of plan.

278
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:45,598
The others are coming back to my place.
Nansy's in residence.

279
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:49,123
Might knock us up a plate of eggs
and bacon over a late-night Scrabble.

280
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:53,439
- I wondered if you'd like to join.
- Oh, yeah! Thanks very much.

281
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:56,041
_ Is there room for Scarlett?
- Oh, absolutely.

282
00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:58,118
1 37 rooms, actually.

283
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,644
Right. Tommy, are you
the richest man in England?

284
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:06,117
Oh, no, no!

285
00:22:06,207 --> 00:22:09,643
_ I believe we're about... seventh.
_ Mm_hm.

286
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:12,036
The Queen, obviously,...

287
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:15,881
..and, uh, that Branson bloke's
doing terribly well.

288
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,926
Well, excellent news.
I'll go and tell Scarlett.

289
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,156
Yeah.

290
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:24,523
That's, uh... unless you get lucky first.

291
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:33,642
Hi.

292
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,480
Hi. Hi. I thought you'd gone.

293
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:41,482
No, not yet. I was just wondering
where you were staying tonight.

294
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,683
Uh, well, um...

295
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:47,043
I was staying at some pub
called The Lucky...

296
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:50,324
-..The Boat or something like that.
_ Boatman.

297
00:22:50,407 --> 00:22:53,524
Right. But now I'm going to stay
at some friends' house...

298
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:56,075
..with, um... some friends.

299
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,842
Well, I think "enormous castle"
is a more accurate description.

300
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:02,236
That's too bad,
because I'm at The Boatman.

301
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,477
Oh.

302
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:08,719
Well, it was... nice not quite meeting you.

303
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:12,636
- It was a great speech.
_ Thanks.

304
00:23:18,327 --> 00:23:23,481
- Well, I'm going now.
- No! No, no. Don't go. We can meet now.

305
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:27,685
- The evening's just getting going.
- We both know that's a big lie.

306
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:33,646
Fuck.

307
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:38,644
# Come on and let it show

308
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:43,241
# Come on and let it show

309
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:48,365
# Sometimes it's hard to be a woman

310
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:53,326
# Giving all your love

311
00:23:53,407 --> 00:23:56,319
# To just one man...

312
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,601
The castle beckons, Tom. Are you sober?

313
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:05,636
- Absolutely. Orange juice all night.
- # I'll be proud of him

314
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:06,796
Come on.

315
00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:10,846
# Cos, after all, he's just a man

316
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,201
Bye, everybody!

317
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:16,246
- All together now!
- # Stand by your man

318
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:21,195
# Give him two arms to cling to...

319
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,998
Bernard!

320
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:28,957
# When nights are cold and lonely

321
00:24:29,327 --> 00:24:31,682
(all) # Stand by your man

322
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,120
# Wah wah wah

323
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:36,597
# And tell the world you love him

324
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:41,966
# And give him all the love you can

325
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:44,083
_ Ow!
- # Stand by...

326
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:46,476
(Charles) Tom, Tom,
can you stop the car?

327
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,558
Stop the car!

328
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:54,045
Sorry. Sorry. I just think
I might, um, stay in that pub after all.

329
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:56,277
- Why on earth...?
_ Um...

330
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:58,358
(all make silly noises)

331
00:25:04,847 --> 00:25:10,126
No, seriously. I'm doing some research
into pubs with the word "boat" in the title.

332
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:13,438
- Oh, well. Please yourself.
- It's a silly thing.

333
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:21,118
Right.

334
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:25,798
Odd decision.

335
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:08,363
Hello.

336
00:26:08,447 --> 00:26:10,438
_ Hi.
_ Hi.

337
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:13,397
In the end there wasn't room for all of us.

338
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:15,557
You said it was a castle.

339
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:20,038
Yes, it is a castle.
It's, um, just a very, very small one.

340
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:22,766
Tiny, in fact.
Just one up, one down, which is rare.

341
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:24,644
Drink, sir?

342
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:27,799
Yeah. I'd like a glass of whisky, please.
Thanks.

343
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,117
- Do you want...?
- Yeah, sounds good.

344
00:26:30,207 --> 00:26:32,198
- Another for the lady.
- Doubles, sir?

345
00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:33,686
Mm. Thanks.

346
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,405
(whistling)

347
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:38,076
Ah! You here, too? How are you?

348
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:42,682
_ Hello. I'm fine.
- Haven't seen Carrie, have you?

349
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,725
_ Who?
- Carrie. American girl. Lovely legs.

350
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:48,802
Wedding guest. Nice smell.

351
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:51,560
- Uh, no. Sorry.
_ Damn!

352
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:54,320
Blast! I think I was in there.

353
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:59,398
If you do see her,
could you tell her I've gone to my room?

354
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:00,840
Yeah, yeah.

355
00:27:00,927 --> 00:27:02,963
- Your whisky, sir.
- Thank you.

356
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:05,322
_ And one for the...
- Road. Lovely.

357
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:08,877
I think I might have one of those.
Do you mind if I join you?

358
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:12,801
- No. It'd be lovely.
- Another glass of whisky and a cigar.

359
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:16,516
Hold on. Make that a bottle.
We might as well settle in, eh?

360
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:18,962
Let's see if we can push on till dawn.

361
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:21,925
- Lovely wedding.
- Yes, yes.

362
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,999
I was at school with his brother Bufty.
Tremendous bloke.

363
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:27,806
He was head of my house.
Buggered me senseless.

364
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:31,084
- Still, it taught me about life.
_ Mm.

365
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,635
Where do you know him from?

366
00:27:33,727 --> 00:27:36,605
- University.
- Oh! Splendid.

367
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:38,678
Splendid. Yep.

368
00:27:39,447 --> 00:27:42,041
I didn't go myself. I couldn't see the point.

369
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:45,642
When you work in the money markets,
what use is Wordsworth, eh?

370
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:49,481
Excuse me, sir. Your wife says
could you come upstairs at once?

371
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,956
Room 1 2, in case you're so drunk
you can't remember.

372
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,197
- My wife?
- Yes, sir.

373
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:57,122
Oh, my wife! Ha ha! My wife!

374
00:27:57,207 --> 00:28:00,404
God! You are drunk
if you can't remember you've got a wife!

375
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:02,284
Yeah, yeah!

376
00:28:02,887 --> 00:28:06,926
- Do you mind if l...
- No, no. Off you go. Best of luck.

377
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:10,716
Lucky bachelor, me. I'll have
another search for that Katie creature.

378
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:13,924
_ Carrie.
- That's the one. Damn fine filly.

379
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:16,558
I think I'm in there.

380
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,164
_ Hi.
_ Hello.

381
00:28:34,247 --> 00:28:37,364
- Sorry about that.
- He was hard to get rid of.

382
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:39,438
Yeah.

383
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:41,518
So, um...

384
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:50,643
Maybe we could just...
skulk around here for a bit...

385
00:28:50,727 --> 00:28:53,560
..and then... go back down.

386
00:28:54,887 --> 00:28:57,321
That's a thought. I don't usually skulk,...

387
00:28:57,407 --> 00:29:01,116
..but I suppose I could skulk
if skulking were required.

388
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,596
Do you skulk regularly?

389
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:08,605
No. No, I don't normally
think of myself as a skulker...

390
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:10,678
..but, um...

391
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:17,037
Well, why don't you come in
and skulk for a while...

392
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,038
..and we'll see?

393
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:32,596
I noticed the bride and groom didn't kiss
in the church, which is kind of strange.

394
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,485
Where I come from, kissing is very big.

395
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:40,365
Is it? Well, I think you're right.
We are probably more reserved.

396
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:43,519
"You may kiss the bride" isn't
actually in the Book of Common Prayer.

397
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:47,316
I always worry I'll go too far
in the heat of the moment.

398
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:49,800
Uh_huh?

399
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:53,002
How far do you think too far would be?

400
00:29:53,087 --> 00:29:55,476
I don't know.

401
00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:58,439
Maybe...

402
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:02,636
..that would be all right.

403
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:07,278
_ I think that would be fine.
- In fact, it might be a bit dismissive.

404
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,598
Maybe this...

405
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:13,962
..would be better.

406
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:19,920
Yeah, I think it would be dangerous
to take it any further.

407
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:22,758
I mean, um...

408
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:26,038
You know...

409
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:36,926
That might be taking it a little far.

410
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:44,246
What about this?

411
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:49,117
Do you think the vicar would think things
had slipped a little out of his control?

412
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:54,327
I think he might. This kind of thing
is really better suited...

413
00:30:54,407 --> 00:30:57,319
..to the honeymoon
than to the service itself.

414
00:30:57,407 --> 00:31:00,240
Why do you think
it's called a honeymoon?

415
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:01,840
Um, I don't know.

416
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:06,398
I suppose it's, uh... "honey"
cos it's sweet as honey...

417
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:11,003
..and, um... "moon"
because it was the first time...

418
00:31:11,727 --> 00:31:14,446
..a husband got to see his wife's bottom.

419
00:31:53,727 --> 00:31:55,718
What's happening?

420
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:59,238
I have to go.

421
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:03,320
_ Where?
_ America.

422
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,998
That is a tragedy.

423
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,283
Just before I go,...

424
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:14,519
..when were you thinking of
announcing the engagement?

425
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:19,355
Sorry. Whose engagement?

426
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:21,879
Ours.

427
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:26,358
I assumed since we slept together
and everything, we'd be getting married.

428
00:32:26,447 --> 00:32:28,836
What did you think?

429
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:32,640
W-w-w... I, um...

430
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:38,962
Gosh! You know, that... that, um...

431
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:42,244
..takes a lot of thinking about,
that kind of thing.

432
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,716
Obviously, I'm... I, um...

433
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:48,685
You're joking.

434
00:32:52,007 --> 00:32:55,716
God! For a moment there,
I thought I was in Fatal Attraction.

435
00:32:55,807 --> 00:33:00,119
You were Glenn Close and I was
gonna find my pet rabbit on the stove.

436
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:03,198
No.

437
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:08,520
But I think we both missed
a great opportunity here.

438
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:15,318
Bye.

439
00:33:21,927 --> 00:33:23,918
(door closes)

440
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:30,766
(alarm rings)

441
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:39,164
THREE MONTHS LATER

442
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:42,002
(Charles) Oh, fuck!

443
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,598
(Scarlett) Mm?

444
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:46,242
Fuck!

445
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:50,760
- Fuck! Fuckity fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

446
00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:53,998
_ Car or taxi?
- Taxi. We could never park.

447
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,602
Car seems a good idea.

448
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:08,238
_ Fuck!
_ Fuck!

449
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:20,399
- Hey...
_ Leave it. No one will notice.

450
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:44,003
Well...

451
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:46,282
Sorry I'm late. Traffic.

452
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:51,679
Yeah... Who is it today?

453
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:23,763
(photographer) One more, please.

454
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,838
They're ready.

455
00:35:33,527 --> 00:35:36,519
(# Handel "The Arrival
of the Queen of Sheba")

456
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:20,403
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

457
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:22,478
_ Amen.
- (all) Amen.

458
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:25,118
Let us pray.

459
00:36:25,207 --> 00:36:29,723
Father, you have made
the bond of marriage a holy mystery,...

460
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:33,962
..a symbol of Christ's love for his church.

461
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:37,881
Hear our prayers for Bernard and Lydia...

462
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:42,519
..through your Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord,...

463
00:36:42,607 --> 00:36:46,361
..who lives and reigns
with you and the Holy Goat...

464
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:48,836
Uh... uh, Ghost.

465
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:52,001
One God, for ever and ever.

466
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:53,795
Amen.

467
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:57,596
- It's his first time. He's a family friend.
_ Ah! Excellent!

468
00:36:57,687 --> 00:36:59,518
Bernard and Lydia,...

469
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:04,317
..I shall now ask if you freely undertake
the obligations of marriage.

470
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:07,285
Bernard, repeat after me.

471
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:11,599
- I do solemnly declare...
- I do solemnly declare...

472
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,326
..that I know not
of any lawful impediment...

473
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,559
..that I know not

00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:49,837
..may not be joined in matrimony

481
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:54,644
Lydia, repeat after me.

482
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:58,763

483

492
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:39,717
I call upon those persons

..to be my awful wedded wife.

499
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:06,639
..to be my lawful wedded wife.

500
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:08,763
That's ri... That's right.

501
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,281
May Almighty God bless you all.

502
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:15,076
The Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spigot... Spirit.

503
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:16,156
(all) Amen.

504
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:18,238
Bravo!

505
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:23,359
(# Handel "The Arrival
of the Queen Of Sheba")

506
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:39,881
(Tom) Thanks.

507
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,958
- Coming, Bernie!
_ Come here!

508
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:43,636
Sorry.

509
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:46,085
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

510
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:47,999
That way?

511
00:39:48,087 --> 00:39:50,601
Sorry. Could you two... Sorry.

512
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:53,358
Sorry!

513
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,756
I've got a new theory about marriage.

514
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:17,044
Two people are in love, they live together,
and one day they run out of conversation.

515
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:21,006
Totally. They can't think of
a single thing to say to each other.

516
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:23,157
That's it! Panic!

517
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:29,083
Then suddenly, it occurs to the chap
that there is a way out of the deadlock.

518
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:33,519
- (Charles) Which is?
- He'll ask her to marry him.

519
00:40:33,607 --> 00:40:35,518
Brilliant! Brilliant!

520
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:39,998
(Gareth) They've got something
to talk about for the rest of their lives!

521
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:43,682
So it's just a way out of
an embarrassing pause in conversation.

522
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:46,281
The definitive icebreaker!

523
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:50,565
- Tom! How's the speech coming along?
- It's pretty good, I think.

524
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:53,878
Something for everyone.
Tears, laughter...

525
00:40:55,447 --> 00:40:58,757
_ Excellent!
- It's a very good theory, Gareth.

526
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:03,602
There is another argument, of course,
that it has something to do with true love.

527
00:41:03,687 --> 00:41:05,723
Well, there's a thought.

528
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:13,726
- Can I help you, sir?
- Can I have three brandies, please?

529
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,798
Hi.

530
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:17,842
Hello!

531
00:41:17,927 --> 00:41:20,441
- How are you?
_ Fine! Fine!

532
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:24,520
Sorry. I'm...
I'm overwhelmed to see you.

533
00:41:25,447 --> 00:41:28,359
Um... Look, don't go back
to America. Please.

534
00:41:29,127 --> 00:41:31,960
- I'll be back in two secs, OK?
_ OK.

535
00:41:33,687 --> 00:41:35,166
Hi, Fi.

536
00:41:35,887 --> 00:41:37,878
Those are yours.
See you in five hours.

537
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:41,960
- Something happened?
- It has. This is a bloody great wedding!

538
00:41:47,127 --> 00:41:48,446
Hi.

539
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:52,361
Well, you look perfect.
In fact, you probably are perfect.

540
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:55,120
- Well, how are you?
- I'm really well.

541
00:41:55,207 --> 00:41:58,597
Charles, I'd like you
to meet Hamish, my fiancé.

542
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:04,485
Excellent! Excellent.

543
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:07,365
How do you do, Hamish?
Delighted to meet you.

544
00:42:07,447 --> 00:42:09,597
Charming surprise to find Carrie back.

545
00:42:09,687 --> 00:42:11,723
Took a lot of persuading, I can tell you.

546
00:42:11,807 --> 00:42:14,275
Darling, I told James
I was going to get you.

547
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:17,359
He'll think I've totally
lost control of you already.

548
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,642
I'll see you later.

549
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:30,561
How are you doing, Charles?

550
00:42:31,367 --> 00:42:33,835
Not great, actually... suddenly.

551
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:38,718
I don't know...

552
00:42:39,647 --> 00:42:43,765
I mean, um...
what the hell's going on here?

553
00:42:43,847 --> 00:42:48,318
Why am I always at weddings
and never actually getting married, Matt?

554
00:42:48,407 --> 00:42:51,365
It's probably because you're a bit scruffy.

555
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:56,318
Or it could also be
cos you haven't met the right girl.

556
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,602
Ah, but you see, is that it?

557
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:04,080
Maybe I have met the right girls.
Maybe I meet the right girls all the time.

558
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:06,317
- Maybe it's me.
_ Nonsense.

559
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:09,080
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,...

560
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,362
..dinner is served.

561
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:15,280
Come on. Odds on,
you meet your wife at dinner.

562
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,404
Yes!

563
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:30,278
Oh, my God!

564
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:35,123
Charles?

565
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:44,077
_ Hi.
_ Hello. I'm Alistair.

566
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:45,156
Great.

567
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:48,478
- I believe you know Veronica.
- Yeah. Hi, Vee. Hi.

568
00:43:48,567 --> 00:43:50,558
Nicki.

569
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:54,318
Great.

570
00:43:59,127 --> 00:44:01,595
Tell me, are you married?

571
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,361
No.

572
00:44:03,447 --> 00:44:06,280
- Are you a lesbian?
_ Good Lord!

573
00:44:07,087 --> 00:44:09,681
Um... Well, what made you say that?

574
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:12,486
It's one of the possibilities
for unmarried girls.

575
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:17,243
It is a bit more interesting than saying
"just never found the right chap", eh?

576
00:44:17,327 --> 00:44:21,366
- Quite right. Why be dull?
- Thank you.

577
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:29,758
The truth is... I have met the right person,
only he's not in love with me.

578
00:44:29,847 --> 00:44:33,237
And until I stop loving him,
no one else stands a chance.

579
00:44:33,327 --> 00:44:35,716
_ Bad luck!
- Yes, isn't it?

580
00:44:37,847 --> 00:44:40,998
I was a lesbian once at school,
but only for 15 minutes.

581
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,317
I don't think it counts.

582
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:52,482
There are 400 different kinds of tea,...

583
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:56,116
..and that's not including
all these so_called fruit teas.

584
00:44:56,207 --> 00:44:59,995
I took Veronica out to lndia at Christmas
to look at the plantations.

585
00:45:00,087 --> 00:45:02,965
_ You and her went there once.
- That's right.

586
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:07,245
Charles was vile. He insisted on
cracking jokes all the time I was ill.

587
00:45:07,327 --> 00:45:10,478
- Trying to cheer you up.
- Oh, you're thatVeronica!

588
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:13,240
Which Veronica? Charlie?

589
00:45:13,327 --> 00:45:16,160
- Remember Bombay?
- When Charles and I were going out,...

590
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:19,922
..he told me he'd had this...
interesting journey round lndia...

591
00:45:20,007 --> 00:45:23,317
..with Vomiting Veronica.
I think that was it.

592
00:45:23,407 --> 00:45:26,524
I don't remember ever mentioning it.
Maybe I did.

593
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:30,759
Oh, come on, Charles! I don't think I've
ever been out with anyone less discreet.

594
00:45:30,847 --> 00:45:34,760
- That's a bit of an exaggeration, isn't it?
_ It is not!

595
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,759
I remember you going on
about this girl Helena...

596
00:45:37,847 --> 00:45:41,078
-..whose mother made a pass at you.
_ I remember this!

597
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:45,240
You couldn't work out whether it would
be impolite not to accept her advances!

598
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:48,364
That's right. Mrs Piggy!
Helena was Miss Piggy,...

599
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:50,881
..so her mother was Mrs Piggy!

600
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,522
I... I think perhaps it was a...

601
00:45:53,607 --> 00:45:56,280
We've both lost a lot of weight since then.

602
00:46:00,807 --> 00:46:01,922
(banging)

603
00:46:02,447 --> 00:46:05,041
Ah, great! The speeches.

604
00:46:05,407 --> 00:46:08,240
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,...

605
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:10,443
..pray silence for the best man.

606
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:26,043
Um, when Bernard told me
he was getting engaged to Lydia,...

607
00:46:26,127 --> 00:46:30,996
..I congratulated him because all his other
girlfriends were such complete dogs!

608
00:46:33,527 --> 00:46:37,315
Although may I say how delighted we are
to have so many of them here today.

609
00:46:40,087 --> 00:46:44,922
I'm particularly delighted to see Camilla,
who many of you will remember...

610
00:46:45,007 --> 00:46:49,717
..as the first person
Bernard asked to marry him.

611
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,243
If I remember rightly,
she told him to sod off!

612
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:54,919
(Gareth laughs)

613
00:46:56,887 --> 00:46:58,878
And lucky for Lydia that she did.

614
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:06,278
It's very disappointing!

615
00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:13,877
We had the most adorable girl
at our table called Carrie.

616
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:17,960
Apparently her fiancé's awfully grand
and he owns half of Scotland.

617
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:21,244
- How are you?
- I'm stuck in the wedding from hell.

618
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:23,921
Ghosts of girlfriends past at every turn.

619
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:26,567
If I meet Henrietta,
the horror will be complete.

620
00:47:26,647 --> 00:47:28,717
Hello, Charles.

621
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,798
Hello, Hen. How are you?

622
00:47:32,247 --> 00:47:33,236
Oh, Hen...

623
00:47:33,327 --> 00:47:36,956
Why can't you leave her alone?
Haven't you hurt her enough?

624
00:47:38,847 --> 00:47:40,439
(sobs)

625
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:44,156
Excuse me. I think I'd better be
where other people are not.

626
00:47:51,487 --> 00:47:52,476
Hello.

627
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:57,483
I'm S_e_r_e_n_a.

628
00:47:58,487 --> 00:48:00,478
Hello.

629
00:48:01,807 --> 00:48:04,367
I'm just learning.

630
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:11,717
I'm probably naking tols of nistakes.

631
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:16,602
No - perfect. Perfect.

632
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:21,366
Would you like to dance?

633
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:27,596
That would be... mice.

634
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:40,638
(girls giggling)

635
00:48:56,527 --> 00:48:58,165
(sighs)

636
00:48:58,247 --> 00:48:59,839
(doorman) Taxi!

637
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:08,960
Good night, sir.

638
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:11,038
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

639
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:22,282
# My true love was true

640
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:25,359
# Ooh

641
00:49:25,447 --> 00:49:28,883
# l, of course, replied

642
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:32,198
# Something here inside

643
00:49:32,287 --> 00:49:38,601
# Cannot be denied...

644
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:41,880
(door opens)

645
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:50,723
(Bernard) It's all right.
Oh, God! This is wonderful.

646
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:54,077
(giggling)

647
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:02,166
(Lydia) Please!

648
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:04,283
_ Ooh!
_ Ooh!

649
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:06,358
(moaning)

650
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:12,760
Wait a minute. This is no fun!
I want to see my lovely husband!

651
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:14,838
(moaning)

652
00:50:35,447 --> 00:50:40,396
Who's a very bad bridegroom indeed?

653
00:50:40,927 --> 00:50:43,122
# Boom boom, boom boom

654
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:46,997
# Gonna get along without you now

655
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:49,681
# Boom boom, boom boom

656
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:53,123
# Gonna get along without you now

657
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:57,475
- Have you got a boyfriend?
_ Yes.

658
00:50:57,567 --> 00:51:01,037
_ What's his name?
- Dolph. He's good at table tennis.

659
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:03,846
- What about you?
_ No. Afraid not.

660
00:51:04,807 --> 00:51:06,798
Why not?

661
00:51:06,887 --> 00:51:09,082
Don't know.

662
00:51:09,727 --> 00:51:14,755
Because most of the blokes I fancy
think I'm stupid and pointless,...

663
00:51:14,847 --> 00:51:17,520
..so they just bonk me
and then leave me,...

664
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:21,441
..and the kind of blokes that do fancy me,
I think are drips.

665
00:51:21,527 --> 00:51:24,041
I can't even be bothered to bonk them,...

666
00:51:24,127 --> 00:51:27,164
..which does sort of
leave me a bit nowhere.

667
00:51:27,727 --> 00:51:30,116
What's bonking?

668
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:34,923
Well, it's kind of like table tennis,...

669
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:37,396
..only with slightly smaller balls.

670
00:51:37,487 --> 00:51:39,079
(moaning)

671
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:41,078
(giggling)

672
00:51:43,207 --> 00:51:45,198
(door creaks)

673
00:51:45,287 --> 00:51:47,278
(gasping)

674
00:51:56,727 --> 00:51:59,082
(laughing)

675
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:01,237
So good!

676
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,677
Oh! Ho_ho_ho_ho!

677
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:17,443
- I love my wife!
- And I love my husband!

678
00:52:17,527 --> 00:52:19,757
_ Oh!
_ Ahh!

679
00:52:20,687 --> 00:52:24,600
- Do you think we'd better get back?
- We could just wait a few minutes...

680
00:52:24,687 --> 00:52:26,678
..and have another go!

681
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:30,646
Naughty, naughty little rabbit!

682
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,278
Found it.

683
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:44,996
Charles! Charles, we must talk.

684
00:52:47,327 --> 00:52:48,726
Right. Right.

685
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:52,163
The thing is, Charlie,
I've spoken to lots of people about you.

686
00:52:52,247 --> 00:52:53,236
Oh, God!

687
00:52:53,327 --> 00:52:56,637
Everybody agrees
you're in real trouble, Charles.

688
00:52:56,727 --> 00:52:57,716
Am l?

689
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:02,039
You see, you're turning into
a kind of serial monogamist.

690
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:06,439
One girlfriend after another,
yet you never really let anyone near you.

691
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:08,404
On the contrary...

692
00:53:08,487 --> 00:53:11,524
You're affectionate to them
and sweet to them.

693
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:14,041
Even to me,
although you thought I was an idiot.

694
00:53:14,127 --> 00:53:16,118
_ I did not.
_ You did.

695
00:53:16,207 --> 00:53:19,358
- I thought U2 was a type of submarine.
- In a way, you were right.

696
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:22,723
- Their music has a naval quality.
- Be serious, Charles!

697
00:53:22,807 --> 00:53:26,436
Give people a chance! You don't
have to think "l must get married",...

698
00:53:26,527 --> 00:53:30,281
..but you mustn't start relationships
thinking "l mustn't get married".

699
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:34,076
Most of the time I don't think at all.
I just potter along.

700
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:35,805
Oh, Charlie!

701
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:39,323
Oh, God! The way you used to look at me!

702
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,716
I just misread it, that's all.

703
00:53:41,807 --> 00:53:44,321
I thought you were going to propose...

704
00:53:44,407 --> 00:53:46,921
..and you were just working out
how to leave!

705
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:50,795
- No, no. I wasn't.
- Oh, God, this is ridiculous!

706
00:53:50,887 --> 00:53:51,876
_ Hen...
_ No.

707
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:55,004
_ Hen... Hen...
_ No.

708
00:53:55,087 --> 00:53:58,363
- Having a good night?
- Yes, yes...

709
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:03,282
It's... it's right up there with my father's
funeral for sheer entertainment value.

710
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:07,121
- I thought you'd gone.
- No. Hamish took the Edinburgh sleeper.

711
00:54:07,207 --> 00:54:09,482
I'm off now. Keep me company?

712
00:54:23,647 --> 00:54:25,638
Here, please.

713
00:54:26,407 --> 00:54:28,875
You wanna come up for a nightcap?

714
00:54:30,807 --> 00:54:34,117
_ You sure?
- Well, yes. I think we can risk it.

715
00:54:34,207 --> 00:54:37,961
I'm pretty sure I can resist you.
You're not that cute.

716
00:54:38,527 --> 00:54:40,677
Sorry... Yeah, great.

717
00:55:51,327 --> 00:55:54,444
Morning, Charles.
Breakfast's up.

718
00:55:54,527 --> 00:55:58,918
ONE MONTH LATER

719
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,962
What are you up to today?

720
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:04,685
Oh, yeah...

721
00:56:05,647 --> 00:56:10,243
I'm taking advantage of the fact that,
for the first time in my entire life,...

722
00:56:10,327 --> 00:56:13,524
..it's Saturday
and I don't have a wedding to go to.

723
00:56:13,607 --> 00:56:15,882
All I have to do is not be late for David.

724
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,958
I was going to go for a job.

725
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:22,757
This new shop called Spank wants
a sales assistant. I think I'd be great.

726
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:26,237
- They sell all this funny rubber stuff.
- Oh, no!

727
00:56:26,327 --> 00:56:28,795
Another wedding invitation...

728
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:31,355
..and a list. Lovely!

729
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:33,961
They say rubber's mainly for perverts.

730
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,278
Don't know why.
I think it's very practical, actually.

731
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:40,086
You spill anything on it
and it just comes off.

732
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:42,806
That could be why the perverts like it.

733
00:56:42,887 --> 00:56:45,082
You all right?

734
00:56:46,087 --> 00:56:48,078
Yeah, yeah.

735
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:52,959
It's that girl, um... Carrie.
You remember the, uh...

736
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:55,242
The American.

737
00:57:04,807 --> 00:57:07,321
Uh, excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

738
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:10,524
- Do you have the wedding list for Banks?
- Certainly, sir.

739
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:14,077
Lots of beautiful things
for around about the £1,000 mark.

740
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:15,600
Uh_huh.

741
00:57:15,687 --> 00:57:19,805
What about things around
the sort of £50 mark? Is there much?

742
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:24,202
Well, you could get
that Pygmy warrior over there.

743
00:57:24,887 --> 00:57:26,878
This? Excellent!

744
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:30,642
If you could find someone
to chip in the other 3,950.

745
00:57:30,727 --> 00:57:33,161
Or our carrier bags are £1.50 each.

746
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:35,636
Why don't you just get 33 of them?

747
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,440
Well, l... I think I'll probably leave it.

748
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:43,485
Thanks very much.
You've been very, um...

749
00:57:44,207 --> 00:57:47,244
- What did you get?
- Blimey!

750
00:57:47,327 --> 00:57:49,602
Well, I never! Um...

751
00:57:49,687 --> 00:57:52,759
Um... nothing yet.
I'm just, you know, deciding.

752
00:57:52,847 --> 00:57:55,919
- It's nice to see you.
- It's nice to see you.

753
00:57:56,887 --> 00:58:01,244
This present thing is great.
I should've gotten married years ago.

754
00:58:01,327 --> 00:58:04,205
- Anybody get the Pygmy?
- The young man thought about it...

755
00:58:04,287 --> 00:58:06,755
Oh, no! (giggles)

756
00:58:06,847 --> 00:58:09,407
Just... just get me an ashtray.

757
00:58:10,007 --> 00:58:13,124
Uh, are... are you free
for about a half_hour?

758
00:58:13,207 --> 00:58:14,560
Yeah, yeah.

759
00:58:14,647 --> 00:58:17,764
I'm meeting my brother,
but... I can be a bit late.

760
00:58:17,847 --> 00:58:21,203
Oh, good! You have
an important decision to make.

761
00:58:21,287 --> 00:58:24,802
- (Carrie) Now, you mustn't laugh!
- OK. Right.

762
00:58:24,887 --> 00:58:29,005
# They're writing songs of love

763
00:58:29,327 --> 00:58:31,716
# But not for me...

764
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,640
What do you think?

765
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:37,919
Divine.

766
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:40,760
- Bit of a meringue?
_ Um...

767
00:58:40,847 --> 00:58:41,836
Grrr...

768
00:58:41,927 --> 00:58:44,395
Oh, don't worry.
We've only just begun!

769
00:58:47,207 --> 00:58:49,596
What do you think?

770
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:52,962
- You're kidding.
_ But it would be wonderful.

771
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:55,561
Maybe next time.

772
00:58:57,207 --> 00:58:59,596
What do you think?

773
00:59:01,607 --> 00:59:03,996
_ Um... uh...
_ I knew it.

774
00:59:04,087 --> 00:59:08,558
- With a staff, you could look after sheep!
_ Don't be rude!

775
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:11,558
It's a bit sexy, this.

776
00:59:12,847 --> 00:59:14,644
Well...

777
00:59:14,727 --> 00:59:17,844
If I were your husband,
I would die of pride.

778
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:19,918
You may be right. It is dangerous.

779
00:59:20,007 --> 00:59:23,716
There's nothing worse at a wedding
than a priest with an erection.

780
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:32,124
It's strange thinking
you'll never sleep with anyone else.

781
00:59:32,207 --> 00:59:36,598
- You don't think you'll be unfaithful?
_ No. Not once I'm married.

782
00:59:36,687 --> 00:59:40,077
I told Hamish I'll kill him if he does,
so I'd better stick to that.

783
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:41,566
Quite right.

784
00:59:41,647 --> 00:59:44,639
Anyway, I reckon
I've had my fair run at it.

785
00:59:45,287 --> 00:59:48,757
What is a fair run these days,
down your way?

786
00:59:48,847 --> 00:59:51,315
Oh, I don't know.

787
00:59:51,407 --> 00:59:53,398
More than one.

788
00:59:53,487 --> 00:59:55,682
Well, come on! Tell me.

789
00:59:56,687 --> 00:59:59,520
I've seen the dress.
We have no secrets.

790
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:05,398
Well...

791
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,203
The first one,...

792
01:00:08,287 --> 01:00:11,404
..of course not easily forgotten,
was kinda nice.

793
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:15,758
- Two... hairy back.
- (Charles chuckles)

794
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:17,925
Three, four, five...

795
01:00:18,007 --> 01:00:22,046
Um, six... was on my birthday
in my parents' room.

796
01:00:22,367 --> 01:00:24,597
- Which birthday?
_ 17th.

797
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:27,565
- We've only reached 17?
- I grew up in the country.

798
01:00:27,647 --> 01:00:30,161
Lots of rolling around in haystacks.

799
01:00:30,687 --> 01:00:33,679
OK. Seven... Mmm...

800
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:36,759
Eight... unfortunately, was quite a shock.

801
01:00:37,807 --> 01:00:41,516
Nine, against a fence.
Very uncomfortable. Don't try it.

802
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:42,596
I won't.

803
01:00:42,687 --> 01:00:46,157
10, oh... was gorgeous.
Just heaven, just...

804
01:00:47,007 --> 01:00:49,282
- Oh, he was wonderful!
_ I hate him.

805
01:00:51,887 --> 01:00:54,845
1 1, obviously after 10, disappointing.

806
01:00:54,927 --> 01:00:57,441
12 through 17, the university years.

807
01:00:57,527 --> 01:00:59,643
Sensitive, caring, intelligent boys.

808
01:00:59,727 --> 01:01:02,480
Sexually speaking, a real low patch.

809
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:04,000
Um...

810
01:01:04,087 --> 01:01:06,237
18... broke my heart.

811
01:01:06,327 --> 01:01:08,716
- Years of yearning.
- I'm sorry.

812
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:12,084
20... Oh, my God!
I can't believe I've reached 20.

813
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:15,886
21, elephant tongue.

814
01:01:17,367 --> 01:01:20,962
22 kept falling asleep.
That was my first year in England.

815
01:01:21,447 --> 01:01:22,436
I do apologise.

816
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:25,519
- 23 and 24 together. That was something!
- Seriously?

817
01:01:25,607 --> 01:01:27,802
27... That was a mistake.

818
01:01:28,887 --> 01:01:32,675
- Suddenly at 27 you make a mistake?
- Yes, he kept screaming.

819
01:01:32,767 --> 01:01:35,839
Very off-putting.
I nearly gave up on the whole thing.

820
01:01:35,927 --> 01:01:38,566
But Spencer changed my mind. That's 28.

821
01:01:38,647 --> 01:01:41,559
- His father, 29.
_ With his father?

822
01:01:41,967 --> 01:01:44,481
30... ugh!

823
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:46,558
31... oh, my God.

824
01:01:47,367 --> 01:01:50,439
32... was lovely.

825
01:01:51,847 --> 01:01:55,283
And then my fiancé, that's 33.

826
01:01:56,407 --> 01:01:58,716
Wow!

827
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:02,277
So... I, uh... came after your fiancé?

828
01:02:02,647 --> 01:02:05,036
No, you were 32.

829
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,645
_ Oh!
- So there you go.

830
01:02:08,727 --> 01:02:12,356
Less than Madonna,
more than Princess Di - I hope!

831
01:02:12,927 --> 01:02:15,361
And how about you?
How many have you slept with?

832
01:02:15,447 --> 01:02:18,439
Christ! Nothing like that many.
I don't know...

833
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:21,519
I don't know what the fuck
I've been doing with my time.

834
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:25,885
Work, probably. Yeah, work.
I have been working late... a lot.

835
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:35,876
I wish I'd rung you.

836
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,956
But then you never rang me.

837
01:02:40,887 --> 01:02:44,562
You ruthlessly slept with me twice
and never rang me.

838
01:02:48,327 --> 01:02:50,318
Oh, bollocks!

839
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:53,242
Help me, please! Please!

840
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:03,645
You're no longer my brother,
you're just some git I once met.

841
01:03:03,727 --> 01:03:05,479
I'm sorry.

842
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:08,320
Carrie, this is David, my brother.

843
01:03:08,407 --> 01:03:10,398
This is Carrie.

844
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:12,840
Hi.

845
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:15,760
We were buying her a wedding dress.

846
01:03:15,847 --> 01:03:18,486
Pathetic excuse.
Who's she marrying?

847
01:03:18,567 --> 01:03:20,523
Some total penis.

848
01:03:20,607 --> 01:03:24,236
What is it about penises
that they get such great wives?

849
01:03:26,567 --> 01:03:29,684
I was just telling him about,
um, you marrying Hamish...

850
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:33,362
..and he said it couldn't have happened
to a nicer fellow.

851
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:36,680
Didn't you do it with her once?

852
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:39,759
- Where are you doing it?
_ Scotland.

853
01:03:39,847 --> 01:03:41,280
Yes.

854
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:44,040
Beautiful breasts.

855
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:47,039
He says that's a beautiful place. Hilly.

856
01:03:48,047 --> 01:03:50,322
You should come to the wedding, too.

857
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:55,481
I want lots of friends to make up for
the gruesome stiffs that Hamish knows.

858
01:03:56,287 --> 01:03:58,517
Well, you'd better go in.

859
01:03:58,927 --> 01:04:00,246
Bye.

860
01:04:00,327 --> 01:04:02,522
- Bye.
- Bye.

861
01:04:06,247 --> 01:04:09,080
Come on _ we're late.

862
01:04:12,407 --> 01:04:14,398
(Charles) Fuck it!

863
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:28,444
Um, look. Sorry.

864
01:04:28,527 --> 01:04:29,642
Sorry.

865
01:04:29,727 --> 01:04:33,163
I just, um, well...
This is a really stupid question,...

866
01:04:33,247 --> 01:04:36,045
..particularly in view
of our shopping excursion,...

867
01:04:36,127 --> 01:04:39,802
..but, uh... I just wondered
if by any chance...

868
01:04:39,887 --> 01:04:44,756
Um, uh... I mean, obviously not,
because I've only slept with nine people.

869
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:47,077
But l... I just wondered, uh...

870
01:04:47,167 --> 01:04:49,635
I really feel, um... uh...

871
01:04:49,727 --> 01:04:54,005
In short, to recap
in a slightly clearer version, uh...

872
01:04:54,087 --> 01:04:58,558
..in the words of David Cassidy,
while still with the Partridge Family,...

873
01:04:58,647 --> 01:05:01,684
..I think I love you. And, uh...

874
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:06,602
I... I... I... just wondered whether
by any chance you wouldn't like to, um...

875
01:05:06,687 --> 01:05:08,678
Uh... uh...

876
01:05:09,487 --> 01:05:12,445
No. No. No, of course not.

877
01:05:12,807 --> 01:05:13,796
Um...

878
01:05:13,887 --> 01:05:16,162
I am an idiot. He's not.

879
01:05:16,247 --> 01:05:18,283
Excellent. Excellent. Fantastic.

880
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:21,598
Lovely to see you.
Sorry to disturb. Better get on.

881
01:05:22,007 --> 01:05:25,124
_ Fuck!
- That was very romantic.

882
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:32,365
Well, I thought it over a lot, you know.
I wanted to get it just right.

883
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:36,600
Important to have said it, I think.

884
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:38,996
Said what, exactly?

885
01:05:40,847 --> 01:05:44,840
Said, uh... you know,
what I just said about, uh...

886
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:48,158
..David Cassidy.

887
01:05:51,527 --> 01:05:54,246
You're lovely.

888
01:06:18,487 --> 01:06:20,523
(thunder)

889
01:06:21,367 --> 01:06:24,996
ONE MONTH LATER

890
01:06:44,287 --> 01:06:48,838
It was ordained for lifelong faithful
relationships and conjugal love.

891
01:06:48,927 --> 01:06:51,725
It was ordained
for the welfare of human society,...

892
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:53,798
..which can be strong and happy...

893
01:06:53,887 --> 01:06:56,879
..only when the marriage bond
is held in honour.

894
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:02,437
Into this holy estate
these two persons now desire to enter.

895
01:07:03,407 --> 01:07:06,365
Wherefore, if anyone can show
any just cause...

896
01:07:06,447 --> 01:07:09,917
..why they may not lawfully
be joined together in marriage,...

897
01:07:10,007 --> 01:07:11,998
..Iet him now declare it.

898
01:07:12,087 --> 01:07:13,645
(latch clicks)

899
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:17,839
(whispers) Sorry.

900
01:07:17,927 --> 01:07:19,918
Please rise.

901
01:07:22,647 --> 01:07:27,516
Do you, Hamish, take this woman
Caroline to be your wedded wife...

902
01:07:27,607 --> 01:07:31,486
..and do you, in the presence of God
and before this congregation,...

903
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:35,799
..promise and covenant to be to her
a loving and faithful husband...

904
01:07:35,887 --> 01:07:38,685
..until God shall separate you by death?

905
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:40,723
I do.

906
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:45,039
Do you, Caroline, take this man Hamish
to be your wedded husband...

907
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:48,915
..and do you, in the presence of God
and before this congregation,...

908
01:07:49,007 --> 01:07:52,522
..promise and covenant to be to him
a loving and faithful wife...

909
01:07:52,607 --> 01:07:55,041
..until God shall separate you by death?

910
01:07:55,127 --> 01:07:56,196
I do.

911
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:58,198
As a token of the covenant...

912
01:07:58,287 --> 01:07:59,515
Fuck_a_doodle_doo!

913
01:07:59,607 --> 01:08:02,201
..these rings are given and received.

914
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:04,164
By these signs...

915
01:08:24,807 --> 01:08:28,004
- How awfully nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

916
01:08:28,087 --> 01:08:30,078
How do you do?

917
01:08:30,447 --> 01:08:32,438
_ Hello.
_ Fred...

918
01:08:33,967 --> 01:08:36,686
You look beautiful.
Not a meringue in sight.

919
01:08:36,767 --> 01:08:38,758
Thanks.

920
01:08:43,767 --> 01:08:45,758
Blimey!

921
01:08:46,527 --> 01:08:49,564
It's Brigadoon!
It's bloody Brigadoon!

922
01:08:59,967 --> 01:09:03,403
Dear old things, as you know,
I've always been proud...

923
01:09:03,487 --> 01:09:06,763
..that there's not a wedding ring
between the lot of us.

924
01:09:06,847 --> 01:09:10,362
Over the passing of the years,
it's beginning to distress me.

925
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:14,326
I'd like to go to the wedding
of someone I really loved for a change.

926
01:09:14,407 --> 01:09:17,479
Don't blame me.
I've asked practically everyone I know.

927
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:19,956
_ You haven't asked me.
_ Haven't l?

928
01:09:20,047 --> 01:09:23,323
Oh, Scarlett... Well, would you like to?

929
01:09:23,407 --> 01:09:25,967
No, thank you.
It was very nice of you to ask.

930
01:09:26,047 --> 01:09:27,844
Well... Any time.

931
01:09:27,927 --> 01:09:30,805
Quite right, Tom, quite right.
That's the spirit.

932
01:09:30,887 --> 01:09:33,685
Tonight, these are your orders.

933
01:09:33,767 --> 01:09:37,760
Go forth and conjugate.
Find husbands and wives.

934
01:09:37,847 --> 01:09:41,283
Excellent. What do you think, Fifi?
Spot a potential hubby?

935
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:43,642
- Bugger off, Tom.
- Quite right.

936
01:09:43,727 --> 01:09:46,366
A toast... before we go into battle.

937
01:09:47,927 --> 01:09:49,599
True love.

938
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:52,042
In whatever shape or form it may come.

939
01:09:52,127 --> 01:09:57,201
May we all in our dotage be proud to say
"l was adored once, too."

940
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,399
- True love.
- (all) True love!

941
01:10:08,887 --> 01:10:11,845
Apparently,
a-a-a-an enormous number of people...

942
01:10:11,927 --> 01:10:15,158
..actually bump into
their future spouses at weddings,...

943
01:10:15,247 --> 01:10:17,238
..w-w-w-which is interesting.

944
01:10:17,327 --> 01:10:20,478
- Yes, I met my husband at a wedding.
_ Ah.

945
01:10:27,727 --> 01:10:32,323
Good Lord, I seem to have
finished my drink. If you'll excuse me.

946
01:10:36,687 --> 01:10:39,326
Hello. My name's Scarlett.

947
01:10:39,407 --> 01:10:42,365
Named after Scarlett O'Hara,
but much less trouble.

948
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:44,756
- What's your name?
- My name's Rhett.

949
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:46,920
No...

950
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:49,237
- Not really?
- No, not really.

951
01:10:49,327 --> 01:10:52,285
- In fact, it's Chester.
_ You kidder!

952
01:10:53,527 --> 01:10:56,678
I always imagine Americans
are gonna be dull as shit.

953
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,758
Of course you're not, are you?

954
01:10:58,847 --> 01:11:01,441
Steve Martin's American, isn't he?

955
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,123
Yes, he is.

956
01:11:04,207 --> 01:11:06,926
You're lovely!

957
01:11:07,447 --> 01:11:09,438
Come on!

958
01:11:14,887 --> 01:11:17,276
Hello, Charles.

959
01:11:17,367 --> 01:11:19,562
Oh, Hen. Hi.

960
01:11:19,647 --> 01:11:22,480
Um... Look, I couldn't
really bear a scene today.

961
01:11:22,567 --> 01:11:25,320
I know we've probably
got tons to talk about...

962
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:28,126
Did I behave that atrociously last time?

963
01:11:28,727 --> 01:11:31,639
Well, you remember
the shower scene in Psycho?

964
01:11:32,207 --> 01:11:34,198
Scarier.

965
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:37,043
God, I'm depressed, Hen! How are you?

966
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:42,247
I'm cheerful! I weigh almost nothing
and I've got a divine new boyfriend.

967
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:46,915
Perhaps you were right.
We should've got married.

968
01:11:47,007 --> 01:11:49,077
No! I'd have had to marry your friends...

969
01:11:49,167 --> 01:11:52,842
_..and I'm not sure I could take Fiona.
- Fiona loves you.

970
01:11:52,927 --> 01:11:56,761
_ Fiona calls me Duckface.
- Well, I never heard that.

971
01:11:56,847 --> 01:11:59,725
Look, darling, come to lunch soon.
Give me a ring.

972
01:11:59,807 --> 01:12:01,798
Oh, still cute!

973
01:12:06,327 --> 01:12:08,318
How's Duckface?

974
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,318
Good form, actually. Not too mad.

975
01:12:10,847 --> 01:12:14,123
- (bagpipes)
- Ladies and gentlemen,...

976
01:12:14,207 --> 01:12:16,402
..the bride and groom!

977
01:12:52,607 --> 01:12:54,996
You like this girl, don't you?

978
01:12:57,367 --> 01:12:59,358
Yes.

979
01:13:01,687 --> 01:13:03,678
Yes, it's, uh...

980
01:13:04,487 --> 01:13:07,479
It's a strange thing
when at last it happens.

981
01:13:07,567 --> 01:13:09,558
And, uh... (chuckles)

982
01:13:09,687 --> 01:13:12,076
..she's marrying someone else.

983
01:13:19,927 --> 01:13:24,045
How about you, Fifi? Have you
identified a future partner for life yet?

984
01:13:25,007 --> 01:13:27,396
No need, really.

985
01:13:28,247 --> 01:13:30,522
The deed is done.

986
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:33,644
I've been in love
with the same bloke for ages.

987
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:37,046
Have you? Who's that?

988
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,836
You, Charlie.

989
01:13:58,407 --> 01:14:00,716
It's always been you.

990
01:14:01,727 --> 01:14:04,639
Since first we met...

991
01:14:04,727 --> 01:14:06,718
..oh, so many years ago.

992
01:14:07,887 --> 01:14:10,117
I knew the first moment.

993
01:14:10,207 --> 01:14:13,085
Across a crowded room! A lawn, in fact.

994
01:14:18,567 --> 01:14:20,762
Doesn't matter.

995
01:14:21,807 --> 01:14:25,402
Nothing either of us can do on this one.
Such is life.

996
01:14:30,047 --> 01:14:33,119
Friends isn't... bad, you know.

997
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:35,516
Friends... is quite something.

998
01:14:37,287 --> 01:14:39,278
Oh, Fi...

999
01:14:42,167 --> 01:14:44,158
Fi...

1000
01:14:45,327 --> 01:14:47,318
(sighs)

1001
01:14:49,807 --> 01:14:52,196
It's not all easy, is it?

1002
01:14:52,887 --> 01:14:54,878
No.

1003
01:14:56,647 --> 01:14:59,366
Just forget this business. Not to be.

1004
01:15:02,807 --> 01:15:04,877
Matthew, darling.

1005
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:08,198
_ Where's Gareth?
- Torturing Americans.

1006
01:15:08,887 --> 01:15:11,082
How thoughtful of him.

1007
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,959
Do you actually know Oscar Wilde?

1008
01:15:17,047 --> 01:15:19,880
(Scottish accent) Not personally, no.

1009
01:15:20,327 --> 01:15:24,764
But I do know someone
who could get his fax number for you.

1010
01:15:25,207 --> 01:15:27,198
Shall we dance?

1011
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:50,318
(Gareth whoops)

1012
01:15:53,767 --> 01:15:57,123
Ohhh!

1013
01:16:01,567 --> 01:16:03,558
Whoo_hoo!

1014
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:13,047
Well? Any rings on fingers?

1015
01:16:13,127 --> 01:16:15,243
Gareth, you don't know
how lucky you are.

1016
01:16:15,327 --> 01:16:17,966
Finding someone to marry
is a tricky business.

1017
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:22,723
It's hell out there! Matthew's trapped
with an evangelist from Minnesota.

1018
01:16:22,807 --> 01:16:24,843
Sweet Jesus, cast out the devil!

1019
01:16:25,487 --> 01:16:30,515
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
please charge your glasses.

1020
01:16:30,607 --> 01:16:34,486
First, and rather unusually,
we have the bride.

1021
01:16:36,047 --> 01:16:38,242
Excellent. I love this girl.

1022
01:16:39,407 --> 01:16:41,398
(Carrie) Thank you.

1023
01:16:41,487 --> 01:16:46,277
First of all, I'd like to thank all of you
who've flown in from the States.

1024
01:16:46,807 --> 01:16:51,323
As for the rest of you, I'd have thought
that lots of frightful Americans flying in...

1025
01:16:51,407 --> 01:16:54,479
..was an excuse for staying away.
So I thank you, too.

1026
01:16:58,327 --> 01:17:02,843
If my darling dad had been here today,
he would have been speaking now,...

1027
01:17:02,927 --> 01:17:04,997
..and I know what he would have said:

1028
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:10,878
"Great dress, babe, but why in the hell
are you marrying the stiff in the skirt?"

1029
01:17:13,247 --> 01:17:17,126
And I would have given him
the same answer that I give you:

1030
01:17:17,207 --> 01:17:19,198
"Because I love him."

1031
01:17:19,287 --> 01:17:22,757
As John Lennon said,
who died the same year as my dad,...

1032
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:26,556
.."Love is the answer,
and you know that for sure."

1033
01:17:27,927 --> 01:17:30,521
(applause)

1034
01:17:31,087 --> 01:17:34,124
Oh! And, um... one more thing.

1035
01:17:34,207 --> 01:17:38,439
Someone told me here that, if things with
Hamish didn't work out, he would step in.

1036
01:17:38,527 --> 01:17:41,883
I just wanted to say:
thanks, and I'll keep you posted.

1037
01:17:46,567 --> 01:17:47,556
Bravo!

1038
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:51,435
Now, my lords, ladies and gentlemen,
Sir Hamish Banks.

1039
01:17:57,687 --> 01:18:00,360
Anyone involved in politics
for the last 20 years...

1040
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,519
..has got used to being
upstaged by a woman!

1041
01:18:04,807 --> 01:18:07,924
I didn't expect it to happen to me
on my wedding day!

1042
01:18:08,007 --> 01:18:11,795
However, I must also say
that I'm quite happy...

1043
01:18:11,887 --> 01:18:15,516
..to be upstaged by this woman
for the rest of my life.

1044
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:19,839
Is that some barracking at the back?
We politicians are used to that.

1045
01:18:20,007 --> 01:18:22,840
_ Shit! Find a... find a doctor!
- Right. OK.

1046
01:18:22,927 --> 01:18:25,680
First of all,
my compliments to the bridesmaids.

1047
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,076
You did your duties superbly.

1048
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:32,479
And obviously I intend to use you
every time I get married from now on!

1049
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:41,956
(Hamish) I want to thank
all those wonderful ladies of the parish...

1050
01:18:42,047 --> 01:18:44,197
..who did the flowers in the church.

1051
01:18:44,287 --> 01:18:48,360
The stern old building took on
a look of flushed youth today.

1052
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:53,398
(applause)

1053
01:18:56,447 --> 01:18:59,996
I remember the first time
I laid eyes on Caroline.

1054
01:19:00,087 --> 01:19:04,763
I thought to myself:
"lf by any chance she's short-sighted,...

1055
01:19:04,847 --> 01:19:08,157
..I might just be happy
for the rest of my life."

1056
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:12,085
I thought I could see my future
for the first time.

1057
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:17,400
It was a joyful one
for years and years to come.

1058
01:19:23,567 --> 01:19:26,718
(all) # For they are jolly good fellows

1059
01:19:27,007 --> 01:19:29,965
# For they are jolly good fellows

1060
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:34,280
# For they are jolly good fellows

1061
01:19:34,727 --> 01:19:37,161
# And so say all of us

1062
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:49,205
Good morning, and a warm welcome
to you all on this cold day.

1063
01:20:49,607 --> 01:20:52,201
Our service will begin in a few minutes.

1064
01:20:52,287 --> 01:20:56,758
But first we have asked Matthew,
Gareth's closest friend,...

1065
01:20:56,847 --> 01:20:59,441
..to say a few words.

1066
01:21:07,527 --> 01:21:10,644
Gareth used to prefer funerals
to weddings.

1067
01:21:10,727 --> 01:21:13,446
He said it was easier to get enthusiastic...

1068
01:21:13,527 --> 01:21:18,362
..about a ceremony one had an outside
chance of eventually being involved in.

1069
01:21:20,087 --> 01:21:23,204
In order to prepare this speech,
I rang a few people...

1070
01:21:23,287 --> 01:21:27,838
..to get a general picture of how Gareth
was regarded by those who met him.

1071
01:21:29,247 --> 01:21:33,126
"Fat" seems to have been a word
people most connected with him.

1072
01:21:35,127 --> 01:21:37,846
"Terribly rude" also rang a lot of bells.

1073
01:21:39,647 --> 01:21:41,842
So "very fat" and "very rude"...

1074
01:21:41,927 --> 01:21:45,442
..seems to have been
the stranger's viewpoint.

1075
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:49,202
But some of you have rung me
and let me know that you loved him,...

1076
01:21:49,287 --> 01:21:52,404
..which I know he would have been
thrilled to hear.

1077
01:21:52,927 --> 01:21:58,126
You remember his fabulous hospitality,
his strange experimental cooking.

1078
01:22:00,327 --> 01:22:05,037
The recipe for duck à la banana
fortunately goes with him to his grave.

1079
01:22:06,487 --> 01:22:10,924
Most of all, you tell me of
his enormous capacity for joy.

1080
01:22:11,647 --> 01:22:14,559
And, when joyful,...

1081
01:22:14,647 --> 01:22:17,559
..when joyful,
for highly vocal drunkenness.

1082
01:22:19,927 --> 01:22:22,521
I hope joyful is how
you will remember him.

1083
01:22:25,127 --> 01:22:27,516
Not stuck in a box in a church.

1084
01:22:30,847 --> 01:22:34,886
Pick your favourite of his waistcoats
and remember him that way.

1085
01:22:35,287 --> 01:22:39,041
The most splendid, replete,...

1086
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:43,159
..big-hearted,...

1087
01:22:43,687 --> 01:22:46,281
..weak-hearted, as it turned out,...

1088
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:49,359
..and jolly bugger most of us ever met.

1089
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:55,398
As for me, you may ask
how I will remember him.

1090
01:22:56,807 --> 01:22:59,196
What I thought of him.

1091
01:23:03,127 --> 01:23:06,039
Unfortunately, there I run out of words.

1092
01:23:09,207 --> 01:23:11,402
Forgive me
if I turn from my own feelings...

1093
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:16,641
..to the words of
another splendid bugger, WH Auden.

1094
01:23:17,367 --> 01:23:19,517
This is actually what I want to say:

1095
01:23:23,007 --> 01:23:26,397
Stop all the clocks,
cut off the telephone,

1096
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:31,284
Prevent the dog from barking
with a juicy bone,

1097
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:36,398
Silence the pianos
and with muffled drum

1098
01:23:36,487 --> 01:23:40,844
Bring out the coffin,
let the mourners come.

1099
01:23:42,407 --> 01:23:45,046
Let the aeroplanes circle
moaning overhead

1100
01:23:45,127 --> 01:23:49,245
Scribbling on the sky
the message 'He is dead'.

1101
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:54,682
Put crepe bows round
the white necks of the public doves,

1102
01:23:56,727 --> 01:24:00,037
Let traffic policemen
wear black cotton gloves.

1103
01:24:01,647 --> 01:24:05,401
He was my North, my South,
my East and West.

1104
01:24:07,087 --> 01:24:10,318
My working week
and my Sunday rest,

1105
01:24:11,887 --> 01:24:15,846
My noon, my midnight,
my talk, my song;

1106
01:24:18,447 --> 01:24:21,564
I thought that love
would last for ever:

1107
01:24:22,447 --> 01:24:24,642
I was wrong.

1108
01:24:27,807 --> 01:24:30,002
The stars are not wanted now:

1109
01:24:31,367 --> 01:24:33,756
Put out every one;

1110
01:24:34,927 --> 01:24:37,839
Pack up the moon
and dismantle the sun;

1111
01:24:40,447 --> 01:24:43,245
Pour away the ocean
and sweep up the wood;

1112
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:48,323
For nothing now
can ever come to any good.

1113
01:25:23,807 --> 01:25:28,323
It was good of you to come. Must have
been the shortest honeymoon in history.

1114
01:25:28,407 --> 01:25:30,967
No, it's fine.
We'll do it some other time.

1115
01:25:35,767 --> 01:25:37,962
You know, what you said in the street...

1116
01:25:38,047 --> 01:25:41,323
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.
- No, I liked it.

1117
01:25:41,407 --> 01:25:44,080
I liked you saying it.

1118
01:25:54,087 --> 01:25:57,636
- Charlie, I'll take Scarlett home, all right?
_ Yeah.

1119
01:25:58,407 --> 01:26:00,398
Darling Fi.

1120
01:26:08,407 --> 01:26:12,605
- Walk, Charlie?
- Yeah. Yeah, that would be grand.

1121
01:26:16,207 --> 01:26:19,836
Never felt like that.
I mean, something vaguely similar...

1122
01:26:19,927 --> 01:26:22,566
..for Jilly... when I was young.

1123
01:26:22,647 --> 01:26:25,400
- Jilly?
_ Labrador.

1124
01:26:27,847 --> 01:26:30,202
Yes, it's odd, isn't it?

1125
01:26:30,287 --> 01:26:32,755
All these years
we've been single and proud of it...

1126
01:26:32,847 --> 01:26:37,477
..and never noticed that two of us were,
in effect, married all this time.

1127
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,876
Traitors in our midst.

1128
01:26:43,527 --> 01:26:47,406
You know, I think death is hardest
for the parents, don't you?

1129
01:26:47,487 --> 01:26:49,796
I hope I die before my children.

1130
01:26:49,887 --> 01:26:54,199
Tom... There's one thing I find really, uh...

1131
01:26:57,247 --> 01:27:01,001
Well... It's your total confidence
that you will get married.

1132
01:27:01,087 --> 01:27:03,885
I mean, what if
you never find the right girl?

1133
01:27:05,087 --> 01:27:06,076
Sorry?

1134
01:27:06,167 --> 01:27:09,523
Surely, if that service shows anything,...

1135
01:27:09,607 --> 01:27:12,804
..it shows that there is such a thing
as a perfect match.

1136
01:27:12,887 --> 01:27:17,802
If we can't be like Gareth and Matthew,
then maybe we should just let it go.

1137
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,081
Some of us are not gonna get married.

1138
01:27:21,167 --> 01:27:23,556
Well, I don't know, Charlie.

1139
01:27:24,327 --> 01:27:28,878
The truth is, unlike you,
I never expected the thunderbolt.

1140
01:27:29,847 --> 01:27:33,476
I always just hoped that I'd meet
some nice, friendly girl,...

1141
01:27:33,567 --> 01:27:38,197
..Iike the look of her, hope the look of me
didn't make her physically sick,...

1142
01:27:38,287 --> 01:27:42,758
..then pop the question
and... settle down and... be happy.

1143
01:27:44,247 --> 01:27:47,922
It worked for my parents.
Well, apart from the divorce...

1144
01:27:48,247 --> 01:27:51,284
I'll give you six months
at the outside, Tom.

1145
01:27:52,247 --> 01:27:54,238
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1146
01:27:55,167 --> 01:27:59,160
Maybe all this waiting
for one-true_love stuff...

1147
01:27:59,247 --> 01:28:01,636
..gets you nowhere.

1148
01:28:03,127 --> 01:28:05,243
(alarm rings)

1149
01:28:11,247 --> 01:28:13,124
- (another alarm)
_ Mm?

1150
01:28:13,207 --> 01:28:16,597
- (third and fourth alarms)
_ Mmm?

1151
01:28:16,687 --> 01:28:17,836
Ahh!

1152
01:28:17,927 --> 01:28:21,078
- What the fuck is going on?
- (all alarms ringing)

1153
01:28:24,247 --> 01:28:27,956
I thought we'd better make
absolutely sure we weren't late.

1154
01:28:28,527 --> 01:28:30,165
Excellent wedding hairstyle.

1155
01:28:30,767 --> 01:28:33,725
TEN MONTHS LATER

1156
01:28:33,807 --> 01:28:37,277
Matthew...
the best-looking best man in the world.

1157
01:28:37,887 --> 01:28:42,039
Listen... Thank you for doing this today.

1158
01:28:42,127 --> 01:28:44,322
Of course.

1159
01:28:46,527 --> 01:28:49,439
I wish Gareth was here.

1160
01:28:49,527 --> 01:28:51,722
Bet he does, too.

1161
01:28:54,127 --> 01:28:57,597
I'm sorry we're so late.
The others are just parking the car.

1162
01:28:57,687 --> 01:28:59,678
I thought we'd all go with Tom.

1163
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:03,476
_ Late? So late?
_ Yeah. It's 9.45.

1164
01:29:03,567 --> 01:29:07,958
_ 9.45?
- Yep. 45 minutes till "l do".

1165
01:29:08,047 --> 01:29:11,244
Oh, bloody Tom!
I told him to set the alarm for eight!

1166
01:29:11,607 --> 01:29:13,598
Fuck it! Fuck!

1167
01:29:17,687 --> 01:29:20,406
_ Scarlett.
- Oh, hi!

1168
01:29:20,487 --> 01:29:23,877
- You ready?
- Absolutely. Give me 20 seconds.

1169
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:34,925
_ Time.
- Honestly?

1170
01:29:35,007 --> 01:29:35,883
Yes! Time!

1171
01:29:35,967 --> 01:29:38,117
It's about ten to nine.

1172
01:29:38,207 --> 01:29:40,198
(giggling)

1173
01:29:47,447 --> 01:29:49,483
(click)

1174
01:29:55,647 --> 01:29:57,638
Bastards.

1175
01:29:59,807 --> 01:30:02,480
Jessica, stop jumping
up and down, please.

1176
01:30:05,927 --> 01:30:08,487
(Scarlett) One, two, three, smile!

1177
01:30:11,527 --> 01:30:16,123
- This is splendid tuck.
- Yes, I think I might say a little word.

1178
01:30:16,207 --> 01:30:20,962
As you know, I've been a close observer
of Charles's love life for many years.

1179
01:30:21,047 --> 01:30:25,723
But recently I'd started to despair and fear
that really he was married to us,...

1180
01:30:25,807 --> 01:30:30,039
-..except that we won't have his babies.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

1181
01:30:30,127 --> 01:30:33,597
But it's all turned out splendidly.
The girl is sadly crazy,...

1182
01:30:33,687 --> 01:30:35,803
..but perhaps that's why he loves her.

1183
01:30:35,887 --> 01:30:40,642
I'd like to propose a toast to my Charlie
and his beautiful girl on this tragic day.

1184
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:44,276
- So, be happy and don't forget us.
- Thank you.

1185
01:30:44,367 --> 01:30:48,121
_ To Charles and Duckface.
- (others) Charles and Duckface!

1186
01:30:54,087 --> 01:30:56,396
- What do you think?
_ You look divine.

1187
01:30:56,487 --> 01:30:58,921
It does work, doesn't it? Yes.

1188
01:31:01,847 --> 01:31:05,840
I'd like to thank Fiona for those
charming words about my future wife.

1189
01:31:05,927 --> 01:31:09,966
I'd like to take this opportunity
to read a message from her to you all.

1190
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:11,685
Oh, this is exciting!

1191
01:31:11,767 --> 01:31:15,760
She says "Any of you come near
the house, I'll set the dogs on you."

1192
01:31:15,847 --> 01:31:18,520
I think that's a nice touch.

1193
01:31:18,607 --> 01:31:20,518
Sweet! Sweet.

1194
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:22,598
"Set the dogs on you"!

1195
01:31:24,287 --> 01:31:26,437
John, hi.

1196
01:31:26,527 --> 01:31:28,483
- John, you made it.
- Oh, yes.

1197
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:32,242
I hope me damn sister turns up.
Not much of a wedding without a bride.

1198
01:31:32,327 --> 01:31:34,443
_ Tom!
- Hello, John.

1199
01:31:34,527 --> 01:31:37,041
Bit of a poor show
you not having a stag night.

1200
01:31:37,127 --> 01:31:38,276
We did! We did!

1201
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:42,326
We didn't think it was a very good idea
in this day and age.

1202
01:31:42,407 --> 01:31:45,160
Really? Oh!

1203
01:32:03,327 --> 01:32:05,761
Fi, you do look lovely today.

1204
01:32:05,847 --> 01:32:11,001
- I've abandoned my traditional black.
- Yes, so you have.

1205
01:32:11,087 --> 01:32:13,885
From now on, I shall be
all the colours of the rainbow...

1206
01:32:13,967 --> 01:32:18,085
..and fall in love with someone
who fancies me for a change.

1207
01:32:18,167 --> 01:32:20,158
Darling Fi!

1208
01:32:26,407 --> 01:32:28,637
_ Oh... Look.
_ What?

1209
01:32:28,727 --> 01:32:31,366
Lipstick everywhere.
That won't do at all.

1210
01:32:31,727 --> 01:32:33,797
(bells ringing)

1211
01:32:34,727 --> 01:32:36,718
_ Hi.
_ Hi.

1212
01:32:52,247 --> 01:32:54,238
Good luck.

1213
01:32:59,127 --> 01:33:01,561
(Scarlett) Hello.
Glad you could come.

1214
01:33:03,007 --> 01:33:05,157
Groom's on the right.
Bride's on the left.

1215
01:33:08,727 --> 01:33:12,276
- Groom on the right. Bride on the left.
- Oh, my God!

1216
01:33:16,367 --> 01:33:18,517
I thought you'd gone back to Texas!

1217
01:33:19,207 --> 01:33:21,198
Without you, never.

1218
01:33:25,447 --> 01:33:27,438
Good luck.

1219
01:33:31,047 --> 01:33:33,038
Bride or groom?

1220
01:33:35,207 --> 01:33:37,198
Bride or groom?

1221
01:33:37,407 --> 01:33:41,878
It should be perfectly obvious I'm neither.
Great God!

1222
01:33:42,927 --> 01:33:45,316
- Bride or groom?
_ Bride.

1223
01:33:55,207 --> 01:33:58,961
Yes, um... (clears throat) I'm fine.

1224
01:34:01,487 --> 01:34:03,842
You know, I've a feeling we've met before.

1225
01:34:03,927 --> 01:34:06,885
We have. About 25 years ago.

1226
01:34:07,487 --> 01:34:10,877
I'm second cousin Harold's
daughter Deirdre. You're Tom.

1227
01:34:10,967 --> 01:34:12,559
Good Lord!

1228
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,002
- So, you're family.
_ Yes.

1229
01:34:15,807 --> 01:34:19,800
- Only very distant.
- Well, yes... of course.

1230
01:34:21,287 --> 01:34:24,404
You said you were, uh, bride?

1231
01:34:24,487 --> 01:34:25,761
Yes.

1232
01:34:25,847 --> 01:34:27,838
Well, do sit.

1233
01:34:28,207 --> 01:34:30,596
Do sit here, Deirdre.

1234
01:34:34,767 --> 01:34:36,758
Golly!

1235
01:34:37,327 --> 01:34:39,079
Thunderbolt city.

1236
01:34:40,087 --> 01:34:42,521
- Hello, Matthew.
- Nice to see you.

1237
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:45,440
- Hello, Charles.
- Bernard. How are you?

1238
01:34:45,527 --> 01:34:48,121
- Exhausted, actually.
- (Lydia) Oh, bunny!

1239
01:34:48,207 --> 01:34:50,198
_ Charles.
- Hello, Lyd.

1240
01:34:55,647 --> 01:34:57,638
_ Hi.
_ Hi.

1241
01:34:59,287 --> 01:35:03,360
You look lovely. But then I always
did like you dressed for weddings.

1242
01:35:03,727 --> 01:35:07,242
_ And on time.
- Yeah! Extraordinary thing, isn't it?

1243
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:12,003
_ How's Hamish?
- Oh, he's fine... I believe.

1244
01:35:12,087 --> 01:35:14,362
_ You believe?
- Well, yes.

1245
01:35:14,447 --> 01:35:17,120
He wasn't the man for me after all.

1246
01:35:19,647 --> 01:35:22,480
_ You left him?
_ We left each other.

1247
01:35:25,247 --> 01:35:29,126
_ When?
- Oh, a few months now.

1248
01:35:29,207 --> 01:35:32,677
March was, uh... hell.
By April, it was sordid.

1249
01:35:32,767 --> 01:35:36,726
That's the last time
I marry someone three times my age.

1250
01:35:36,807 --> 01:35:39,401
(Matthew) Charles, time to travel.

1251
01:35:39,487 --> 01:35:41,478
Yeah. Yeah.

1252
01:35:43,167 --> 01:35:45,397
Coming. Good. Good...

1253
01:35:48,487 --> 01:35:53,038
- So why didn't you get in touch, then?
_ I did think about it.

1254
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:57,200
I wanted to, but, um... I was in a state.

1255
01:35:58,647 --> 01:36:01,400
So, anyway, I don't want to keep you.

1256
01:36:02,767 --> 01:36:05,201
And... I'll see you afterwards.

1257
01:36:05,287 --> 01:36:07,039
Yeah. Fine.

1258
01:36:07,127 --> 01:36:09,118
Wait!

1259
01:36:13,447 --> 01:36:15,438
I'll show you to your seat.

1260
01:36:17,167 --> 01:36:19,556
Just showing her to her seat.

1261
01:36:31,567 --> 01:36:34,127
Our timing's been really bad, hasn't it?

1262
01:36:34,207 --> 01:36:36,641
It's been bad, yes.

1263
01:36:36,727 --> 01:36:38,922
It's been a disaster.

1264
01:36:39,007 --> 01:36:41,396
It has, as you say, been...

1265
01:36:42,567 --> 01:36:44,956
..very bad indeed.

1266
01:36:48,127 --> 01:36:50,721
God, it's lovely to see you!

1267
01:36:52,847 --> 01:36:55,077
Well, good luck.

1268
01:36:55,167 --> 01:37:00,287
It's pretty easy. Just say "l do"
whenever anyone asks you a question.

1269
01:37:05,647 --> 01:37:07,638
Um...

1270
01:37:08,887 --> 01:37:11,606
Could you just give me a sec, Matthew?

1271
01:37:11,687 --> 01:37:14,804
Yes, of course. Freshen up at will.

1272
01:37:33,167 --> 01:37:35,158
Dear Lord,...

1273
01:37:35,247 --> 01:37:37,761
..forgive me for what I'm about to...

1274
01:37:39,647 --> 01:37:43,640
..say in this magnificent place of worship.

1275
01:37:45,167 --> 01:37:46,566
Bugger.

1276
01:37:48,407 --> 01:37:50,716
Bugger!

1277
01:37:50,807 --> 01:37:53,082
Bugger! Bugger! Bugger!

1278
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:55,158
Bugger!

1279
01:37:56,527 --> 01:37:58,643
Can I help at all?

1280
01:37:58,727 --> 01:38:01,082
Huh? No. Thanks.

1281
01:38:01,727 --> 01:38:02,921
Sorry.

1282
01:38:03,007 --> 01:38:06,682
Um, vocal exercises. Big church.

1283
01:38:06,767 --> 01:38:09,281
Excellent. Often do the same myself.

1284
01:38:09,367 --> 01:38:14,236
Not exactly the same vocab, obviously.
Rather more alleluias!

1285
01:38:14,327 --> 01:38:16,522
I'll leave you.

1286
01:38:30,087 --> 01:38:32,078
(baby cooing)

1287
01:38:33,807 --> 01:38:35,877
- Bride's arriving.
- Oh, fabulous!

1288
01:38:35,967 --> 01:38:38,356
We seem to have lost the groom.

1289
01:38:38,887 --> 01:38:42,800
_ Stall her and I'll see if I can find him.
- Roger. Wilco.

1290
01:38:49,887 --> 01:38:51,878
_ Charles.
_ Mm.

1291
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:55,556
It's good to see you.

1292
01:38:57,647 --> 01:38:59,956
Yeah. Yeah.

1293
01:39:00,047 --> 01:39:01,605
Um...

1294
01:39:01,687 --> 01:39:04,838
Matt, what do we, uh,
think about marriage?

1295
01:39:05,687 --> 01:39:08,838
Well... Gosh! Uh...

1296
01:39:08,927 --> 01:39:11,646
- Well, I think it's really good...
_ Mm...

1297
01:39:11,727 --> 01:39:14,958
..if you love the person
with all your heart.

1298
01:39:15,047 --> 01:39:18,244
Well, exactly. Quite.

1299
01:39:21,527 --> 01:39:25,361
All these weddings.
All these, um... years.

1300
01:39:26,727 --> 01:39:29,844
All that blasted salmon and champagne.

1301
01:39:29,927 --> 01:39:35,843
Here I am on my own wedding day
and l, uh, I'm... still thinking.

1302
01:39:36,527 --> 01:39:38,722
Can I ask about what?

1303
01:39:38,807 --> 01:39:40,798
Um...

1304
01:39:41,447 --> 01:39:43,358
No.

1305
01:39:43,447 --> 01:39:45,438
No, I think best not.

1306
01:39:46,087 --> 01:39:49,318
I'm sorry, there's a delay.
A problem with the flowers.

1307
01:39:49,407 --> 01:39:50,396
Flowers?

1308
01:39:50,487 --> 01:39:54,560
There seems to be a staggeringly
high proportion of hay fever sufferers...

1309
01:39:54,647 --> 01:39:57,400
..and they're right next to
the damn flowers.

1310
01:39:57,487 --> 01:39:59,557
So we're moving the congregation.

1311
01:39:59,647 --> 01:40:01,956
Don't want the vows
obliterated by sneezing.

1312
01:40:02,047 --> 01:40:06,325
Charles, would it be out of place
for me to say that time is ticking by?

1313
01:40:08,367 --> 01:40:10,358
What's happening?
Tell me.

1314
01:40:14,287 --> 01:40:17,085
Oh, God.

1315
01:40:17,167 --> 01:40:20,523
I just saw Carrie...
and she's separated.

1316
01:40:20,607 --> 01:40:23,838
Charles. It's your wedding day.

1317
01:40:27,127 --> 01:40:29,118
Should have started by now.

1318
01:40:30,887 --> 01:40:32,878
I think I've fooled them so far.

1319
01:40:32,967 --> 01:40:36,039
When people think you're stupid,
they're less suspicious.

1320
01:40:36,127 --> 01:40:37,958
What's your advice?

1321
01:40:38,047 --> 01:40:41,198
You've got three choices:
one - go ahead with it...

1322
01:40:42,927 --> 01:40:45,919
Two - go outside and say
"Sorry, folks, it's all off!"

1323
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:48,677
Not tempting. Next?

1324
01:40:49,767 --> 01:40:51,758
Third...

1325
01:40:52,807 --> 01:40:55,526
I can't think of a third.

1326
01:40:56,967 --> 01:40:58,366
(knocking)

1327
01:40:58,447 --> 01:41:00,642
Hello.

1328
01:41:00,727 --> 01:41:02,319
Here you are!

1329
01:41:02,407 --> 01:41:04,557
Ready to face the enemy?

1330
01:41:06,247 --> 01:41:08,238
Are we?

1331
01:41:11,567 --> 01:41:13,558
Yes.

1332
01:41:14,887 --> 01:41:16,878
Excellent.

1333
01:41:38,687 --> 01:41:40,564
(# Mendelssohn "Wedding March")

1334
01:42:08,967 --> 01:42:10,958
Not so tight, Dad!

1335
01:42:38,487 --> 01:42:42,844
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God...

1336
01:42:42,927 --> 01:42:45,441
..and in the face of this congregation...

1337
01:42:45,527 --> 01:42:48,917
..to join together this man
and this woman in holy matrimony,...

1338
01:42:49,007 --> 01:42:51,123
..which is an honourable estate,...

1339
01:42:51,207 --> 01:42:54,517
..instituted of God
in the time of man's innocence,...

1340
01:42:54,607 --> 01:42:59,920
..signifying unto us the mystical union
that is betwixt Christ and his Church...

1341
01:43:00,367 --> 01:43:03,359
..and therefore is not
by any to be enterprised...

1342
01:43:03,447 --> 01:43:07,122
..nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
lightly, or wantonly,...

1343
01:43:07,207 --> 01:43:10,483
..but reverently, discreetly, advisedly,...

1344
01:43:10,567 --> 01:43:12,046
..soberly,...

1345
01:43:12,127 --> 01:43:14,118
..and in the fear of God.

1346
01:43:14,807 --> 01:43:17,401
Therefore, if any man
can show any just cause...

1347
01:43:17,487 --> 01:43:20,081
..why they may not
lawfully be joined together,...

1348
01:43:20,167 --> 01:43:24,445
..Iet him speak now or else hereafter
for ever hold his peace.

1349
01:43:26,607 --> 01:43:28,086
(knocking)

1350
01:43:29,327 --> 01:43:32,842
I'm sorry.
Does someone have something to say?

1351
01:43:38,607 --> 01:43:40,802
(vicar) Yes? What is it?

1352
01:43:42,687 --> 01:43:44,200
One... one second.

1353
01:43:44,287 --> 01:43:45,800
What's going on?

1354
01:43:47,447 --> 01:43:49,517
I thought of a third option.

1355
01:43:50,727 --> 01:43:52,604
What?

1356
01:43:52,687 --> 01:43:55,201
Will you translate?

1357
01:43:55,287 --> 01:43:58,563
Translate what?

1358
01:43:58,647 --> 01:44:01,480
He wants me to...
translate what he's saying.

1359
01:44:01,567 --> 01:44:03,000
What is he saying?

1360
01:44:03,087 --> 01:44:05,920
I think the groom is having doubts.

1361
01:44:06,007 --> 01:44:08,965
He says "l suspect the groom
is having doubts."

1362
01:44:10,007 --> 01:44:12,123
"l suspect the groom would like to delay."

1363
01:44:12,207 --> 01:44:16,120
I think the groom really loves
someone else. That's true, isn't it?

1364
01:44:16,207 --> 01:44:17,879
"l suspect the groom..."

1365
01:44:17,967 --> 01:44:21,846
Because, Charlie -
this is for the rest of your life.

1366
01:44:21,927 --> 01:44:26,796
Finally, you've got to marry the person
you love with your whole heart.

1367
01:44:26,887 --> 01:44:29,606
And by the way -
your flies are undone.

1368
01:44:30,127 --> 01:44:32,118
What's he saying?

1369
01:44:34,647 --> 01:44:36,956
He says...

1370
01:44:37,047 --> 01:44:40,005
..he suspects the groom...

1371
01:44:40,087 --> 01:44:42,362
..Ioves someone else.

1372
01:44:43,127 --> 01:44:44,606
(vicar) Do you?

1373
01:44:44,687 --> 01:44:47,440
Do you love someone else?
Do you, Charles?

1374
01:44:58,727 --> 01:45:01,036
_ I do.
_ Ohhhh!

1375
01:45:04,087 --> 01:45:05,964
(Henrietta) Aaaah!

1376
01:45:06,047 --> 01:45:08,038
Get out of my way! Let me kill him!

1377
01:45:13,447 --> 01:45:15,438
(thunder)

1378
01:45:17,927 --> 01:45:19,918
Blimey!

1379
01:45:21,367 --> 01:45:23,642
At least it's one we won't forget.

1380
01:45:23,727 --> 01:45:26,605
A lot of weddings
just blend into each other, don't they?

1381
01:45:26,687 --> 01:45:30,236
_ For God's sake!
- This one will stick out in the memory.

1382
01:45:30,327 --> 01:45:33,125
For not actually including
a wedding service.

1383
01:45:33,207 --> 01:45:35,801
(Fiona) Poor girl. No, I mean it! Poor girl!

1384
01:45:35,887 --> 01:45:39,926
She's not my favourite person, but I think
what you did today was unforgivable.

1385
01:45:40,007 --> 01:45:42,316
I can't bear to think about it.

1386
01:45:43,327 --> 01:45:44,806
Poor Hen.

1387
01:45:44,887 --> 01:45:48,277
- (Tom) Though... Iet's face facts.
- I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

1388
01:45:48,367 --> 01:45:52,076
If you weren't sure you wanted
to marry her today of all days,...

1389
01:45:52,167 --> 01:45:55,239
..i.e., your wedding day,...

1390
01:45:55,327 --> 01:45:58,763
..then it must be the right decision,
mustn't it?

1391
01:45:59,487 --> 01:46:00,522
Quite right.

1392
01:46:00,607 --> 01:46:04,600
It was a lovely dress.
I'm sure she'll find it useful for parties.

1393
01:46:08,087 --> 01:46:11,159
- What did he say, Charles?
- Says he blames himself.

1394
01:46:11,247 --> 01:46:14,364
- (Tom) Oh... Absolutely not.
- (Matthew) No, you mustn't, David.

1395
01:46:14,447 --> 01:46:16,438
They all blame you too.

1396
01:46:17,687 --> 01:46:21,282
- (doorbell)
- No, no. If there's music to be faced,...

1397
01:46:21,367 --> 01:46:23,562
..I should be facing it.

1398
01:46:31,967 --> 01:46:33,923
Hello.

1399
01:46:34,007 --> 01:46:36,965
- Hi! You're soaking. Come in.
- No, no. I'm fine.

1400
01:46:37,047 --> 01:46:39,197
Comes a point when you can't get wetter.

1401
01:46:39,287 --> 01:46:42,120
- OK, I'll come out.
- No, please don't. I...

1402
01:46:42,207 --> 01:46:44,767
I just wanted to check you're OK.

1403
01:46:44,847 --> 01:46:48,203
Not busy killing yourself
or anything, but...

1404
01:46:49,647 --> 01:46:52,036
But you're fine, so...

1405
01:46:53,687 --> 01:46:57,396
I shouldn't have come
to the church this morning. I'm sorry.

1406
01:46:58,127 --> 01:47:00,118
No! No!

1407
01:47:00,687 --> 01:47:04,965
Wait. It was all myfault.
I mean, l... I'm the bastard here.

1408
01:47:06,447 --> 01:47:08,438
And it sorted out one thing.

1409
01:47:08,527 --> 01:47:12,725
Marriage and me were...
very clearly not meant for one another.

1410
01:47:12,807 --> 01:47:14,798
It sorted out another big thing, too.

1411
01:47:14,887 --> 01:47:17,765
There I was,
standing there in the church,...

1412
01:47:17,847 --> 01:47:21,157
..and for the first time
in my whole life I realised l...

1413
01:47:21,247 --> 01:47:24,603
..totally and utterly loved one person.

1414
01:47:24,687 --> 01:47:27,121
And it wasn't the person
next to me in the veil.

1415
01:47:27,207 --> 01:47:30,756
It's the person
standing opposite me now...

1416
01:47:32,767 --> 01:47:34,166
..in the rain.

1417
01:47:34,247 --> 01:47:36,920
Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed.

1418
01:47:37,007 --> 01:47:41,603
The truth of it is, I've... Ioved you
from the first second I met you.

1419
01:47:42,527 --> 01:47:48,284
- You're not going away again, are you?
- No. I might drown. But otherwise, no.

1420
01:47:48,367 --> 01:47:50,835
OK... OK. We'll go in.

1421
01:47:53,807 --> 01:47:56,275
But first let me ask you one thing.

1422
01:47:58,247 --> 01:48:01,762
Do you think... after we've dried off,...

1423
01:48:02,207 --> 01:48:06,598
..after we've spent lots more
time together, you might agree...

1424
01:48:08,287 --> 01:48:10,562
..not to marry me?

1425
01:48:10,647 --> 01:48:13,286
And do you think...

1426
01:48:13,367 --> 01:48:18,282
..not being married to me might maybe
be something you could consider...

1427
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:20,835
..doing for the rest of your life?

1428
01:48:25,527 --> 01:48:27,916
Do you?

1429
01:48:29,447 --> 01:48:31,642
I do.
