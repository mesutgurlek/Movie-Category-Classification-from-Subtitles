00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:18,393
- Have you consulted the young lady?
- No, not yet.

300
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,767
As a matter of fact, our man Devlin just
brought here down here the other day.

301
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,239
Now we're waiting for Sebastian
to come back to Rio.

302
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,742
Has your Mr. Devlin told her
the nature of the work?

303
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:30,713
No, we haven't discussed it
with him at all. But I can set
your mind at rest about her.

304
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,875
- You're sure of her political side?
- Oh, oh, yes.

305
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:38,250
Well, there is nothing to be lost
if we proceed as you advise.

306
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,689
Now, that's fine. I'll give Devlin
his instructions right away.

307
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,584
It's nice out here.

308
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:47,749
Let's not go out for dinner.
Let's stay here.

309
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,053
We have to eat.

310
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:53,926
We can eat here.
I'll cook.

311
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:57,058
I thought you didn't
like to cook.

312
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,727
No, I don't like to cook.

313
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,804
But I have a chicken in the icebox,
and you're eating it.

314
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,275
What about all the washing up
afterward?

315
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,676
We'll eat it with our fingers.

316
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,715
Don't we need any plates?

317
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,183
Yes. One for you and one for me.

318
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,583
Mind if I have dinner
with you tonight?

319
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,228
I'd be delighted.

320
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:27,092
- Where are you going?
- Well, if we're going to stay in,

321
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,224
I have to telephone the hotel,
see if there are any messages.

322
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:33,337
- You have to?
- I have to.

323
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,478
<i>[Dialing Phone]</i>

324
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,745
This is a very strange
love affair.

325
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,980
Why?

326
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,387
Maybe the fact
that you don't love me.

327
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:59,757
<i>Hello? Palace Hotel?
Parle Anglais?</i>

328
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:03,527
This is T.R. Devlin.
Are there any messages for me?

329
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,502
When I don't love you,
I'll let you know.

330
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,538
You haven't said anything.

331
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,404
- Actions speak louder than words.
- [Chuckling]

332
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:14,478
There is? Good.
Read it to me, please.

333
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,090
Prescott wants me over
right away.

334
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,955
- Did he say what about?
- No.

335
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,859
- Maybe it's our assignment.
- Probably.

336
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,735
Do you want me to bring
anything back with me?

337
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,744
Yes. What about a nice bottle of wine?
We'll celebrate.

338
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,348
What time shall I come back?

339
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,450
Seven o'clock.

340
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,687
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

341
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:20,371
<i>[Prescott] What is it, Devlin?
What's the matter?</i>

342
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,707
<i>- I don't know if she'll do it.
- What do you mean,
you don't think she'd...</i>

343
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:25,908
<i>- You haven't discussed it
with her, have you?
- I didn't know what the job was.</i>

344
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,177
Well, what do you mean,
she wouldn't do it?

345
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,584
Well, I don't think she's that type
of woman. She strikes me as being...

346
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,691
<i>I don't understand your attitude.</i>

347
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:37,158
<i>- Why do you think she won't do it?
- Well, she's had no experience.</i>

348
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:41,026
<i>Oh, come now. What experience
does she lack, do you think?</i>

349
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,101
She's never been trained for that
kind of work. They'll see through her.

350
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,704
Miss Huberman was chosen
not only because her father...

351
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:49,397
gives her an ideal background,
but because Sebastian knows her.

352
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,808
Oh, yes. He was once
in love with her.

353
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,146
Oh, I didn't know that.

354
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,751
I don't see why we're arguing
about petty things like this.

355
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,786
We've got important work to do.
Sebastian's house is a cover-up...

356
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,186
for whatever this Farben
group's up to here in Rio.

357
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:10,260
<i>We've got to get Miss Huberman
inside that house and find out
what's going on there.</i>

358
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,830
So I think you'd better go back
to Miss Huberman and explain
to her what she has to do.

359
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,195
<i>- I, uh...
- Well, what is it?</i>

360
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,792
- Nothing, sir.
- Oh, I thought you were
going to say something.

361
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,168
<i>- How is the meeting to be arranged?
- Oh, well, we've discussed that.</i>

362
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,072
I think the riding club
would be the best place.

363
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:29,044
Sebastian usually
rides there in the mornings.

364
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,776
So the rest is up to you
and Miss Huberman.

365
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,682
- Okay, Devlin, that's all.
- All right.

366
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,527
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

367
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,730
<i>- [Alicia] Dev, is that you?
- Uh-huh.</i>

368
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,271
<i>I'm glad you're late. This chicken
took longer than I expected.</i>

369
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:59,275
<i>What did they say?
Hope it isn't done too much.</i>

370
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,675
It caught fire once.

371
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,976
<i>I think it's better
if I cut it up out here.</i>

372
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:08,108
<i>Unless you want a half a one
to yourself. [Chuckles]</i>

373
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,777
<i>We're going to have
knives and forks after all.</i>

374
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,117
<i>I've decided we're
going to eat in style.</i>

375
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:17,592
Marriage must be wonderful with this
sort of thing going on every day.

376
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,296
I wonder if it's too cold out here.
Maybe we should eat inside.

377
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,902
Hasn't something like this
happened before?

378
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,708
What's the matter?

379
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,715
Don't look so tense.
Troubles?

380
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:44,186
Well, handsome, I think you'd better
tell mama what's going on.

381
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,553
All this secrecy's going
to ruin my little dinner.

382
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:51,423
Come on, Mr. D.,
what is darkening your brow?

383
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,327
- After dinner.
- No, now.

384
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,535
Look, I'll make it easy for you.
The time has come...

385
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,833
when you must tell me that you have
a wife and two adorable children...

386
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:05,136
and this madness between us
can't go on any longer.

387
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:08,075
I'll bet you've heard
that line often enough.

388
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:16,544
Right below the belt every time.
Oh, that isn't fair, Dev.

389
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:20,919
Skip it. We have other things
to talk about. We've got a job.

390
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,359
Oh. So there is a job.

391
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:29,426
You, uh... You remember
a man named Sebastian?

392
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,128
<i>- Alex Sebastian?
- Yes.</i>

393
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:36,331
One of my father's friends, yes.

394
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,707
He had quite a crush on you.

395
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,778
I wasn't very responsive.

396
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:47,015
Well, he's here. The head
of a large German business concern.

397
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,177
His family always had money.

398
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,619
He's part of the combine that
built up the German war machine
and hopes to keep on going.

399
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:56,124
- Something big?
- It has all the earmarks
of being something big.

400
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,320
We have to contact him.

401
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,006
Go on.
Let's have all of it.

402
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:20,709
We're meeting him tomorrow.
The rest is up to you.

403
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:23,615
You've got to work on him
and land him.

404
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,919
Mata Hari.
She makes love for the papers.

405
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,085
<i>There are no papers.
You land him.</i>

406
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,662
Find out what's going on
inside his house,

407
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,733
what the group around him
is up to, and report to us.

408
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:42,267
I suppose you knew about this pretty
little job of mine all the time.

409
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:46,173
No. I only just
found out about it.

410
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,146
Did you say anything?

411
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,944
I mean, that maybe I wasn't
the girl for such shenanigans?

412
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,180
I figured that was up to you.

413
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,756
- If you'd care to back out...
- I suppose you told them,

414
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,861
"Alicia Huberman will have this
Sebastian eating out of her
hand in a couple of weeks.

415
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,192
- She's good at that. Always was."
- I didn't say anything.

416
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:14,995
Not a word for that little
lovesick lady you left an hour ago?

417
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,776
I told you,
that's the assignment.

418
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,741
Oh, well, now,
don't get sore, Dev.

419
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:27,784
I'm only fishing for
a little bird call from my dream man.

420
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,713
One little remark such as,

421
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,257
"How dare you gentlemen
suggest that Alicia Huberman...

422
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,295
the new Miss Huberman...
be submitted to so ugly a fate?"

423
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,763
That's not funny.

424
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,229
Do you want me to take the job?

425
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,740
- You're answering for yourself.
- I am asking you.

426
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,811
It's up to you.

427
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,279
Not a peep, hmm?

428
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:03,686
Oh, darling, what you didn't
tell them, tell me...

429
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:07,622
that you believe I'm nice and that
I love you and I'll never change back.

430
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,954
I'm waiting for your answer.

431
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,261
What a little pal you are.

432
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:25,899
Never believing me, hmm?
Not a word of faith.

433
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,604
Just down the drain with Alicia.
That's where she belongs.

434
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:34,649
Oh, Dev, Dev.

435
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,331
When do I go to work
for Uncle Sam?

436
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,433
Tomorrow morning.

437
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:05,211
<i>Oh, we shouldn't have had this out here.
It's all cold now.</i>

438
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,586
What are you looking for?

439
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,688
I had a bottle of champagne.
I must have left it somewhere.

440
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,733
In case you're asked,
I'm with Pan American Airways.

441
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,361
- As Devlin?
- Yes. Public relations office.

442
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,531
Anything else?

443
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,370
No, except we met on the plane
coming in from Miami.

444
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,536
Less detail, the better.

445
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,918
- Are you sure that's him?
- Yes.

446
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:52,654
We'll go by him easy,
let him spot you. Come on.

447
00:34:22,527 --> 00:34:24,961
I guess I'm the girl
nobody remembers.

448
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,063
- Was it Sebastian?
- Yes.

449
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,689
We'll stick around,
give him another chance.

450
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:55,392
<i>[Bell Ringing]</i>

451
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,363
<i>##[Orchestral]</i>

452
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,381
My dear Alicia, will you
forgive me for being late?

453
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:22,384
Last minute conference at the office.
You got my message?

454
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,216
- Yes. It's all right, Alex.
- Sweet of you to wait.

455
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:28,484
- I was afraid you might run on.
- Oh, I'm not that easily put off.

456
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,890
I was too anxious
to meet you again.

457
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,054
You know, I'm tired.

458
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:36,667
The worst thing about business
is it makes you feel old and look old.

459
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,564
You seem to have escaped
all of that.

460
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,400
Four years of dullness
and disintegration. Awful.

461
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,031
Alex, you look younger
than you did in Washington.

462
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:48,667
Well, it's a temporary improvement,
entirely due to your presence, my dear.

463
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,280
You always affected me like a tonic.

464
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,884
Perhaps now
with you here in Rio...

465
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,919
unless you insist
on running away from me again...

466
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:59,523
Oh, uh, would you like
another drink?

467
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,558
<i>- Yes. Thank you.
- Deux martinis.</i>

468
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,935
You know him?

469
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,662
No, I don't think so.
But he seems familiar.

470
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,703
Captain Prescott,
intelligence man.

471
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,808
He's down here as part
of a Washington espionage.

472
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:21,207
<i>- The American embassy
is loaded with them.
- Really?</i>

473
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,806
Hey, he's rather
handsome, isn't he?

474
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,417
I'm allergic
to American agents.

475
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:30,419
Their fine points don't
particularly appeal to me.

476
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,149
Have the bothered you
since you came down?

477
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,315
No. No, not yet.

478
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,561
They were troublesome in Miami?

479
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,631
Yes. That's why I left
right after the trial,

480
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,767
to get away from their snooping.

481
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:47,132
I wondered why
you left your father.

482
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,266
He insisted.
He was so unselfish.

483
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:54,775
He kept worrying about me,
begging me to leave.

484
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,437
I had no idea
he was going to die.

485
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,015
Many things have died
for all of us.

486
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:03,643
We mustn't let our spirit
die with them.

487
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:07,052
Perhaps I can help you
to forget. I'd like to.

488
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:11,757
It's odd...

489
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,387
but I feel at home with you.

490
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,434
You know, my dear,
I knew this was going to happen.

491
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,666
I knew when we met the other day
that if I saw you again,

492
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,299
I'd feel what I used to for you.

493
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,207
<i>The same hunger.</i>

494
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,747
<i>You're so lovely, my dear.</i>

495
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:35,284
Oh, now I'm going
to make a fool of myself again.

496
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,321
There's someone else, of course.
Who is it this time?

497
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:41,152
That Mr. Devlin you were with?

498
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,226
There is no one.

499
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,226
<i>He seemed attentive.</i>

500
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,331
Mr. Devlin has pestered me with his
attentiveness ever since I arrived.

501
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,835
<i>- I met him on the plane from Miami.
- You made a pretty couple.</i>

502
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:57,737
Oh, Alex, Mr. Devlin
doesn't interest me.

503
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:04,072
I was so lonely that day, I could
have gone riding with Peter Rabbit.

504
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:07,274
You'll let me help
your loneliness?

505
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:13,889
You are very sweet to forget
what a brat I was... once.

506
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:18,461
My dear, I shall test out
your repentance at once.

507
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,655
Will you have dinner with me
again tomorrow night?

508
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,028
- Thank you very much.
- My house?

509
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:29,371
<i>- Yes, how nice.
- My mother is giving a dinner party.</i>

510
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,498
She won't mind an extra guest?

511
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,645
An old friend
is never an extra guest.

512
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,713
Well, shall we order now?

513
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,944
- Yes, yes. I'm starved.
- Garcon.

514
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,523
<i>Now, let's see, what shall we...
what shall we have for our first
dinner together?</i>

515
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,498
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

516
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,797
- Good evening.
- Very good.

517
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,034
Yes, yes, isn't it?

518
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,179
Oh, I'd like you to wear these.
They're rented for the occasion.

519
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,315
Oh. All right.

520
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:15,381
Would you help me,
please? L...

521
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,886
- Why-Why, yes, certainly.
- Thank you.

522
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,388
So, uh, the old boy knew me, eh?

523
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,652
Yes. He thought
you were very handsome.

524
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,523
Oh, you don't say?
Sorry I'm not going with you.

525
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,654
- Oh, Dev'll pick those up later.
- All right.

526
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,699
Now, try to memorize the names
of all the people you see there tonight.

527
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,702
The men, I mean. And get their
nationalities. That's very important.

528
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,238
You mean the Germans?
That won't be difficult for me.

529
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,537
And I suggest that you don't ask any
questions. Just use your eyes and ears.

530
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,771
They're a pretty keen and desperate
bunch. Don't underestimate them.

531
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,541
Right. Thank you for your
instructions. Good evening.

532
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:48,583
Oh, by the way, unless you have
something very urgent to report,

533
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,449
I suggest that you two keep shy
of each other for the next few days.

534
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,387
That's in case Sebastian's people
want to check on you after your visit.

535
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:56,516
- Yes, I understand.
- That's all. Good luck.

536
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,559
- Good evening.
- Good night.

537
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,720
<i>- ##[Piano]
- Good evening. I'm Miss Huberman.</i>

538
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,766
Will you tell Mr. Sebastian
that I'm here?

542
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,955
Please forgive me
for keeping you waiting.

543
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:37,356
<i>- Not at all.
- You resemble your father very much.</i>

544
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,521
<i>- I'm Alex's mother.
- I knew when I saw you.</i>

545
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:44,225
Alex has always admired you.
Now at last I know why.

546
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:46,267
You're very kind.

547
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:50,204
You did not testify at your father's
trial. We thought that unusual.

548
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,777
He didn't want me to. He refused
to let his lawyers call me on the stand.

549
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,844
I wonder why.

550
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,915
<i>Hello... Alicia.</i>

551
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,780
I'm so glad.
You met my mother.

00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,910
- Yes, we just met.
- You didn't meet Alicia...

553
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,283
when we were in Washington
four years ago, did you, Mother?

554
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,619
I don't know where
you were at the time.

555
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,353
Alex, I think we should
join our other guests.

556
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,662
- May I take your wrap?
- Thank you.

557

<i>[Sebastian] Miss Huberman,
may I present Eric Mathis?</i>

564
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,195
Delighted.

Dr. Anderson is our guest
of honor tonight.

570
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,913
You mustn't bore Miss Huberman,
Alex, with discourses on science.

571
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,987
Not before dinner, anyway.

<i>[Butler]
Dinner is served, madame.</i>

Dr. Anderson, you will sit
beside me, over there.

574
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:24,032
Eric, you will sit
next to Miss Huberman.

<i>[Dr. Anderson]
You have just come from Spain, senora?</i>

<i>[Mrs. Sebastian]
A few weeks ago. It seems ages.</i>

577
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:33,036
<i>Travel does not mean anything
anymore. It goes so swift.</i>

578
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,043
<i>- [Indistinct Whispering]
- One has the feeling
of not going anywhere.</i>

00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:41,413
<i>I suppose we can expect
rocket ships to be carrying us
across the ocean very soon.</i>

580
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,611
<i>[Dr. Anderson]
You can expect many strange things.</i>

581
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,814
- See a good movie
this afternoon, Eric?
- No. I was disappointed.

582
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:50,586
Hmm, must have been a comedy. You know,
Eric loves to go to the movies to cry.

583
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,752
He's very sentimental.

584
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,694
<i>[Mrs. Sebastian Rambling]</i>

585
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:59,234
<i>It takes nearly as long to go
from the city to the airport...</i>

586
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,237
<i>as it does to cross
over the Atlantic.</i>

587
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:18,253
I'm afraid, gentlemen, that
something must be done about Emil.

588
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:23,725
I don't know. It was an understandable
slip. The man was tired.

589
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,887
No. It was
a very dangerous slip.

590
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:30,363
It's not the first one. There have been
several other lapses before.

591
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,867
There'll be more,
if we permit them.

592
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,403
That's bad.
That's very bad.

593
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,133
I think, gentlemen, you can
leave it to me to find some way.

594
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:41,972
When you drive up to Petropolis,
the road winds quite a bit.

595
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,011
It is very high.

596
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:46,514
There are some
very awkward turns.

597
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,485
I'm sure I will not have
any difficulty in getting Emil
to give me a lift in his car.

598
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:54,716
It's quite a trick to jump clear.

599
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,918
I'll just have to be careful,
that is all.

600
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:00,222
Turned my ankle the last time.

601
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,337
Madame says,
will you join the others...

602
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,876
or will you take
your coffee in here?

603
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:17,776
Oh, I think we'll take
coffee in here, Emil.

604
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,110
I'm very sorry, gentlemen,
to make such an exhibition.

605
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,451
Ah, nonsense.
We all have nerves.

606
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:31,755
You have been overworking.
Don't you think so, Rossner?

607
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:35,491
You need a rest. Your health
is very important to us.

608
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:39,067
Oh, that's very considerate.
I am very tired.

609
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:43,196
So, now I think perhaps
if-if you'll make my pardon...

610
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:46,605
to the ladies, Alex, for my
leaving so early, then l...

611
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,145
Maybe, Emil, it would be better
if I came with you.

612
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:53,078
I think that perhaps
if you try to drive yourself...

613
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,947
all the way up to Petropolis,
it might be too much for you.

614
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,077
I shall drive you.

615
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,746
No. That would be
too much for you.

616
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,018
All that way.
That's too much to ask.

617
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,127
Nonsense.
I'd love to go.

618
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,356
Come on, Emil.
Good night, gentlemen.

619
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,329
Good night, Alex.

620
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,402
I hope you'll feel better
in the morning, Emil.

621
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,903
Thank you.
And I'm very sorry...

622
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,634
to make a scene
before strangers.

623
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:20,709
Very sorry.

624
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,937
Thank you, Alex,
for an excellent dinner.

625
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:26,674
And please tell your mother
for me that the dessert was superb.

626
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:32,587
[Crowd Cheering]

627
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:40,889
Miss Huberman has
been gone a long time.

628
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:44,228
Mother, is it necessary for you to
always address Alicia as Miss Huberman?

629
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:46,563
I do wish you'd be
a little more cordial to her.

630
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:49,036
Really, I thought I was
behaving rather well.

631
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,164
- Has she been complaining about me?
- Oh, no.

632
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,970
- I'm grateful.
- You might smile at her.

633
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,773
Wouldn't it be a little too much if
we both grinned at her like idiots?

634
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,109
Please, Mother,
I want to enjoy myself.

635
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,582
Is it so boring
to sit with me alone?

636
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,984
Not at all, not at all.

637
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,492
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

638
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,655
- I thought I saw you.
- How are you?

639
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,029
- Fine, thanks.
Great turnout, isn't it?
- Yes.

640
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,660
- Where are they?
- In a box in the stand.

641
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,808
I don't think they can see us,
Alex and his mother.

642
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:28,877
Don't telephone me anymore.
Just rely upon my popping up.

643
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,573
- Can you hear me?
- Sure. Go ahead.

644
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,843
Heard of a Dr. Anderson?

645
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,715
- No.
- He's some kind of a scientist.

646
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:42,724
Kind face, 60 years old, gray hair,
deep crease in forehead.

647
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,727
- Tall or short?
- Short.

648
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,388
- Uh-huh.
- Emil Hupka? Heard of him?

649
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,430
No.

650
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:55,163
He made quite a scene
about a wine bottle the other night.
