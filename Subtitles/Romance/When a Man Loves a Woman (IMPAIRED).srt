I'm talking about some losers at my

1076
01:31:21,789 --> 01:31:24,451
The trouble with all these losers
at your meeting...

1077
01:31:24,525 --> 01:31:26,925
is that they're not perfect
like some people.

1078
01:31:26,994 --> 01:31:31,055
They're married to alcoholics who are
bouncing off the walls,

1079
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:33,396
and they don't know
what the fuck to do.

1080
01:31:33,468 --> 01:31:35,993
So you might have to
be a little tolerant,

01:31:36,070 --> 01:31:40,530
give them the benefit of your
expertise in problem solving.

1088

01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:40,884

My wife is an alcoholic,
and we're separated.

And she's doing great.

1230
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:54,562
She has her life, uh, back.

1231
01:42:54,633 --> 01:42:57,966
She seems
to have her life back.

1232

so good, which is funny, I guess.

I look at her now when I drop off
the kids at the house,

she's doin' with the kids,

1242
01:43:57,378 --> 01:43:59,312

1243

That maybe she never
really needed me...

she needed me.

But, uh, you really
have to watch 'em closely,

1250

because, you know,
they just--

1251

even from themselves.

That's what it's for.

1266

No wonder I'm confused.

1267

- Well, I'll sleep on you-- it.
- [ Laughing ]

1269

You wanna go home
with me, huh?

1270
01:46:28,863 --> 01:46:31,024
- Never entered my mind.
- Enters mine.

- Really?
- Yeah, all the time.

1272
01:46:35,536 --> 01:46:39,336
I just don't know
what it would be like.

1273
01:46:39,407 --> 01:46:43,104
- Because I'm really afraid
of that roller coaster thing...
- I hate that.

1274
01:46:43,177 --> 01:46:46,613
- when people break up
and make up and break up.
- People can be immature.

1275
01:46:46,681 --> 01:46:50,583
And the very thing that attracts them is
the reason they shouldn't be together.

1276
01:46:50,651 --> 01:46:55,054
And I can't do that, Michael.
I can't do that anymore.

They're talking about rollbacks
in this domicile,

from the bottom scale.

1284

Well, you've worked a lot of years
to just start at the bottom.

I can bid for

I couldn't stop
getting drunk.

1380
01:55:14,246 --> 01:55:19,650
Ithad never really happened quite
like that, and I still don't know why.

1381
01:55:19,718 --> 01:55:22,551
I've lied to everyone
that I know,

1382
01:55:22,621 --> 01:55:25,112
everyone I love,
and, um...

1383
01:55:26,191 --> 01:55:28,125
I was ashamed
and terrified...

1384
01:55:28,193 --> 01:55:30,718
and humiliated every day.

1385
01:55:32,131 --> 01:55:35,100
Um, one day l...

1386
01:55:35,167 --> 01:55:38,398
got out of the shower,
grabbed a towel...

1387
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:40,404
and decided
to go get the paper.

1388
01:55:40,472 --> 01:55:43,635
And nobody saw me go out
the front door or at the curb,

1389
01:55:43,709 --> 01:55:45,643
which was
a very good thing,

1390
01:55:45,711 --> 01:55:49,010
because I was holding the towel
just folded in my hand.

[ Sighs ]

1393
01:55:54,553 --> 01:55:56,578
I know how lucky
I've been,

1394
01:55:56,655 --> 01:55:59,749
'cause there were times when I drove
my little girls around...

1395
01:55:59,825 --> 01:56:01,793
just ripped out of my mind.

1396
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:04,294
One Saturday I took
my baby girl on errands,

1397
01:56:04,363 --> 01:56:06,763
and when I got home,

1398
01:56:06,832 --> 01:56:09,801
I realized
she wasn't with me.

1399
01:56:11,737 --> 01:56:13,967
I had left her someplace.

1400
01:56:15,174 --> 01:56:18,109
And since I couldn't
remember where I'd been,

1401
01:56:18,177 --> 01:56:21,271
I had no idea where, so--

1402
01:56:24,650 --> 01:56:26,743
[ Sighs ]

1403
01:56:26,819 --> 01:56:30,755
I spent the next few hours calling
every shop I'd ever been to...

1404
01:56:30,823 --> 01:56:34,418
until finally the tile guy
rang my front doorbell.

1405
01:56:34,493 --> 01:56:37,428
They had found
my address on a check.

1406
01:56:39,097 --> 01:56:43,500
I rewarded him, of course, you know,
by never going back to his store.

1407
01:56:43,569 --> 01:56:48,529
<i>My bottom</i>

1408
01:56:49,675 --> 01:56:52,303
when my, uh,

1409
01:56:52,377 --> 01:56:54,902
my little girl
watched me...

1410
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:58,347
wash down aspirin
with vodka.

1411
01:56:59,618 --> 01:57:01,552
And then I hit her.

1412
01:57:04,623 --> 01:57:08,286
And when I passed out,
she was alone with me,

1413
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:10,351
and she thought
I was dead.

1414
01:57:14,933 --> 01:57:20,235
And all of my life, I will never know
what that did to her.

1415
01:57:23,742 --> 01:57:26,939
I know I have to
forgive myself for that.

1416
01:57:29,681 --> 01:57:34,209
And I have to forgive myself
for what I've done to my husband.

1417
01:57:34,286 --> 01:57:38,450
<i>It's horrifying how much you can</i>
<i>hate yourself for being low and weak.</i>

1418
01:57:38,524 --> 01:57:41,618
And he couldn't save me from that,
so I turned it on him.

1419
01:57:41,693 --> 01:57:45,823
I tried to empty it onto him,
but there was always more, ya know?

1420
01:57:45,898 --> 01:57:48,230
<i>When he tried to help,</i>

1421
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:52,930
I told him that he made me
feel small and worthless.

1422
01:57:54,206 --> 01:57:57,232
But nobody makes us
feel that, man.

1423
01:57:57,309 --> 01:58:00,005
We do that for ourselves.

1424
01:58:01,747 --> 01:58:04,409
I shut him out because...

1425
01:58:04,483 --> 01:58:08,385
I knew if he ever
really saw...

1426
01:58:08,453 --> 01:58:10,387
who I was inside,

1427
01:58:11,723 --> 01:58:13,782
that he wouldn't love me.

1428
01:58:17,129 --> 01:58:19,791
And we're separated now.

1429
01:58:19,865 --> 01:58:21,799
He's moved away.

1430
01:58:21,867 --> 01:58:25,803
And it was so hard
not to beg him to stay.

1431
01:58:28,707 --> 01:58:31,642
And I don't know if I'm
gonna get a second chance,

1432
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:35,874
but I have to believe
that I deserve one.

1433
01:58:37,015 --> 01:58:39,813

I can do it too.

Like a cigarette?

- Yes. Thank you, sponsor.

just like that.

1450
01:59:57,696 --> 02:00:00,688
They can even make you cry,
just like that.

1451
02:00:02,834 --> 02:00:05,325
And that's
just with her smiles.

1452
02:00:06,571 --> 02:00:09,938
You'd have to see her
with her kids.

You'd have to see
how they look at her...

when she's not lookin'.

1455
02:00:19,451 --> 02:00:21,919
To think of all the things
she lived through,

1456
02:00:21,987 --> 02:00:23,921
and I couldn't help her.

1457
02:00:25,290 --> 02:00:27,918
Maybe helping
wasn't your job.
