1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:03,695
<i>You think I can't hear you</i>
<i>every day talking about visions</i>

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:05,663
<i>and three-eyed ravens</i>
<i>and black magic?</i>

3
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:07,998
I don't want you talking to him till
we get to Castle Black.

4
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:10,701
We're not going to Castle Black.
Jon Snow isn't there.

5
00:00:10,736 --> 00:00:12,496
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

6
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:14,172
Oh, no, I'm not
going back there.

7
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:17,342
I promised your maester I'd get you
to Castle Black and no further.

8
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:19,945
You won't win. You don't
have the discipline.

9
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:22,114
- You don't know how to fight together.
- You don't know that.

10
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:24,817
If you attack the Wall
you'll die, all of you.

11
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:26,585
All of <i>us.</i>

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,055
I can't force them
to meet us in the field.

13
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:32,525
- Casterly Rock can't run away.
- Can you do it?

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,394
There is only one person
in this kingdom

15
00:00:34,429 --> 00:00:36,964
with that kind of army.
Walder Frey.

16
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:39,867
We will do whatever we can to
give Lord Frey what he needs.

17
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:43,370
Our father requires Lord Edmure
to wed one of his daughters.

18
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:46,073
- You were sent here to kill me?
- I don't want to.

19
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:48,108
What do your captains
have to say about that?

20
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,778
Daario:
<i>You should ask them.</i>

21
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:53,147
Will you fight for me?

22
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:56,217
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

23
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:58,286
My sword is yours,
my life is yours,

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,054
my heart is yours.

25
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,625
- Is that the Blackwater?
- Where do you think I'm taking you?

26
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:06,194
- Back to King's Landing.
- That's the Red Fork.

27
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:07,729
I'm taking you
to the Twins.

28
00:01:07,764 --> 00:01:10,398
Your uncle's marrying
one of the Frey girls.

29
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,567
Your mother and brother
will be there

30
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,536
and they'll pay me for you.

31
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:16,839
That rain will cost
us another day.

32
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:19,475
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

33
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:22,144
- He's getting the wedding he wanted.
- He's getting a wedding.

34
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:24,147
<i>It was a king he wanted.</i>

35
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:26,582
It's come for the baby.

36
00:01:26,617 --> 00:01:27,884
You stay back!

37
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:32,455
- ( grunts )
- No, you can't have him.

38
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,224
- <i>No!</i>

No.

49

It's dangerous.

50
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,207
If we take Tywin's
castle from him,

51
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,510
the lords of Westeros will
realize he's not invincible.

52

Take his home,

Why are you telling me?

55
00:04:14,987 --> 00:04:16,821
You begged me
not to send Theon

56
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,759
to negotiate with his father
and I ignored your advice.

57
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,097
Now Winterfell is burnt
to the ground,

58

the North is overrun
with ironborn,

and Bran and Rickon
are gone.

60
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,805
So Casterly Rock...

61
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:40,111
I'm asking your advice.

62
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,386
We have enough men?

63
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,226
If Walder Frey cooperates.

64
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,229

cooperates.

<i>before we take</i>
<i>the castle...</i>

67
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:13,044
we'll be caught between
Tywin's army and the sea.

68
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:20,817
We'll lose the war and die
the way Father died.

69
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:22,852
Or worse.

70
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:31,694
Show them how it feels
to lose what they love.

71
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:04,493
Walder:
<i>My honored guests...</i>

We thank you for your
hospitality, my lord.

77
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:28,485
I have come to make
my apologies, my lord,

78
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,387
and to beg
your forgiveness.

79
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:33,790
Don't beg my forgiveness,
Your Grace.

80
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:38,328
It wasn't me you spurned.
It was my girls.

<i>One of them was supposed</i>

Now none of them are.

83
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:59,782
This is Arwyen
my daughter.

84
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:04,420
<i>My daughter Walda,</i>
<i>my daughter Derwa,</i>

<i>Ginia and Neila.</i>

88

<i>Serra and Sarra,</i>
<i>granddaughters, twins.</i>

89
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:24,773
You could have
had either.

90
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:28,077
<i>Could have had both</i>
<i>for all I care.</i>

91
00:07:28,111 --> 00:07:30,545
My granddaughter
Marianne.

92
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,448
<i>My granddaughter Freya.</i>

93
00:07:34,884 --> 00:07:37,285

Wertha.

Waldina.

- I'm Merry.
- Fine.

98
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,900
And here's my youngest
daughter Shirei,

99
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:55,871
<i>though she hasn't</i>
<i>bled yet.</i>

100
00:07:55,905 --> 00:07:58,774
Clearly you don't have
the patience for all that.

101
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:01,777
My ladies.

102
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:05,314
All men should keep their
word, kings most of all.

103
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:09,885
I was pledged to marry one
of you and I broke that vow.

104
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,087
<i>The fault</i>
<i>is not with you.</i>

105
00:08:12,155 --> 00:08:15,524
<i>Any man would be lucky</i>
<i>to have any one of you.</i>

106
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:18,460
<i>I did what I did</i>
<i>not to slight you,</i>

107
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:20,329
but because I loved another.

108
00:08:20,363 --> 00:08:22,264
<i>I know these words</i>
<i>cannot set right</i>

109
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:24,332
<i>the wrong I have done</i>
<i>to you and your house.</i>

110
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:27,669
I beg your forgiveness

111
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:30,805
and pledge to do
all I can to make amends

112
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:33,675
so the Freys of the Crossing
and the Starks of Winterfell

113
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:35,643
may once again be friends.

114
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:44,853
Walder:
<i>Very good.</i>

115
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:48,990
There she is.

116
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:51,159
<i>Come closer.</i>

117
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,160
Let me have a look at you.

118
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:02,302
Still can't see you.

119
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:04,471
Old eyes.

120
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:21,356
Love.

121
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,261
<i>That's what the Starks</i>
<i>of Winterfell call it, eh?</i>

122
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:27,329
( chuckles )

123
00:09:27,364 --> 00:09:29,398
Very honorable.

124
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:31,700
I call it a pretty face.

125
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:34,804
Mmm, very pretty.

126
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,008
Prettier than this lot,
that's for sure.

127
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,612
Very shapely as well.

128
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:47,317
<i>Oh, you try to hide her</i>
<i>under that dress.</i>

129
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:49,319
If you wanted to hide her,

130
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:51,722
you shouldn't have brought her
here in the first place.

131
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:59,397
I can always see

132
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,266
what's going on
beneath a dress.

133
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,203
<i>Been at this a long time.</i>

134
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,106
<i>I bet when you take</i>
<i>that dress off,</i>

135
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,842
everything stays
right where it is.

136
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,676
Doesn't drop an inch.

137
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:19,214
Your king says he betrayed
me for love.

138
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:21,984
I say he betrayed me
for firm tits

139
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:24,620
and a tight fit.

140
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:27,322
And I can respect that.

141
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:32,360
When I was your age,
I'd have broken 50 oaths

142
00:10:32,394 --> 00:10:35,829
to get into that
without a second thought.

143
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:42,636
Well, I've enough room
in the hall for you lot.

144
00:10:42,671 --> 00:10:44,738
We'll set up
tents outside

145
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:47,141
with food and ale
for the rest of your men.

146
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:49,343
Thank you, my lord.

147
00:10:52,614 --> 00:10:54,182
Well, let's get ready.

148
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:56,251
The wine will flow red

149
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:59,755
<i>and the music</i>
<i>will play loud</i>

150
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:03,993

this mess behind us.

151

- <i>( horse neighs )</i>
- <i>( weapons clang )</i>

152
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:14,703
Where?

153
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,338
There.

154
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:26,315
There.
It's a back gate.

155
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:29,251
My men use it when they
visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

156
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:30,987
Your men,
but not you?

157
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:32,655
Daario: <i>I have no interest</i>
<i>in slaves.</i>

158
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,958
A man cannot make love
to property.

159
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:39,863
This is where
we enter the city.

160
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:41,365
Very few guards.
They know me.

161
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,900
They let me inside--

162
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:45,169
We're not gonna sneak
an army through a back gate.

163
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,173
I kill the guards.
I take your two best men

164
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,576
and lead them through the back
streets, which I know well,

165
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,711
and open the front gates.

166
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,346
Then comes the army.

167
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,015
Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.

168
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,953
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey
Worm and me to the slaughter,

169
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,455
cutting the head
off our army.

170
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,225
<i>The masters of Yunkai</i>
<i>will pay you your fee</i>

171
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,627
and you won't have
to split it three ways

172
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:09,662
'cause you've already
slaughtered your partners.

173
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:12,165
You have
a very suspicious mind.

174
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,268
In my experience, only dishonest
people think this way.

175
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,639
You command the Unsullied.

176
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,042
<i>What do you think?</i>

177
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,644
<i>( Daenerys speaking</i>
<i>Valyrian )</i>

178
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,022
You leave tonight.

179
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,157
Very good.

180
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,992
We'll prepare.

181
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,698
Ser Jorah.

182
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,402
You can use
an extra sword.

183
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,938
You're the Queensguard,
Ser Barristan.

184
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,007
Your place
is by the queen.

185
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,476
If we are truly
her loyal servants,

186
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,545
we'll do whatever
needs to be done

187
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,716
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

188
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,289
We're west
of Castle Black,

189
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:11,324
but the Nightfort's
closest to us.

190
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,494
It was the first
castle on the Wall.

191
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,930
The Watch abandoned it during
the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

192
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,634
Too big.
Impossible to maintain.

193
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,003
Other than
Castle Black itself,

194
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,505
the Nightfort's
the perfect castle for us.

195
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,009
It's got a secret
sally port,

196
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,645
the Black Gate,
as old as the Wall itself.

197
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,415
No one's used it
in centuries most likely.

198
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,117
It leads through the Wall

199
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,052
right down
into the Nightfort,

200
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,954
if one knows
how to find it,

201
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,890
which, it just
so happens, I do.

202
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,230
How do you know
all that?

203
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:57,201
I read about it
in a very old book.

204
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:04,274
You know all that

205
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:07,243
from staring
at marks on paper?

206
00:14:08,312 --> 00:14:10,313
Yes.

207
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:13,116
You're like a wizard.

208
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,302
Our father
used to tell us

209
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:34,707
that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.

210
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:37,243
Here we are.

211
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,613
Alive.

212
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,919
<i>( donkey braying )</i>

213
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:58,631
Remember what happens
to children who run.

214
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:01,501
I'm your father
and I'll do the talking.

215
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,747
The roads have gone
right to hell, haven't they?

216
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:15,916
Cracked three spokes
this morning.

217
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,952
- Need a hand?
- Need about eight hands.

218
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:19,920
Oh!

219
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:22,122
Got to get this
salt pork to the Twins

220
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:24,758
in time for the wedding.

221
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:27,294
Many thanks.

222
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:31,031
Don't!

223
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:32,366
Don't kill him.

224
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,568
Dead rats don't squeak.

225
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,270
You're so dangerous,
aren't you?

226
00:15:36,337 --> 00:15:38,338
Saying scary things
to little girls.

227
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:41,141
Killing little boys
and old people.

228
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,609
A real hard man you are.

229
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:44,611
More than anyone
you know.

230
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:47,380
You're wrong.
I know a killer.

231
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:50,050
- A real killer.
- That so?

232
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:51,685
You'd be like
a kitten to him.

233
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,054
He'd kill you
with his little finger.

234
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:56,189
That him?

235
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,592
- No.
- Good.

236
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:02,562
Don't kill him.

237
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,864
Please.

238
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,033
Please don't.

239
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,737
You're very kind.

240
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:13,739
Someday it'll
get you killed.

241
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,208
( groaning )

242
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,247
( grunts )

243
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,925
Where are we?

244
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,160
The Gift, I think.

245
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,829
Brandon the Builder
gave all this land

246
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,931
<i>south of the Wall</i>
<i>to the Night's Watch</i>

247
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:41,901
for their sustenance
and support.

248
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:44,204
Maester Luwin
taught me that.

249
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:48,275
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

250
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:52,012
It's good land
and there's no war up here.

251
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:53,547
Why leave?

252
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:55,282
Wildlings.

253
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,050
Sorry.

254
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,786
But they come over
the Wall and raid,

255
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,654
steal, carry off women.

256
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,889
Old Nan said they turn
your skull into a cup

257
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,991
and make you drink
your own blood from it.

258
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,362
That's what Old Nan said.

259
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,064
There's a storm coming.

260
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,734
- I don't see any--
- <i>( thunder rolling )</i>

261
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,939
It's as good a place
to shelter as any.

262
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,545
We can drink some blood
while we wait.

263
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,713
I don't need much.

264
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,516
( screeching )

265
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,962
Only one old man
and eight good horses.

266
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,098
What's one old man
doing with eight horses?

267
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,999
He breeds them
for the Watch.

268
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:50,002
How's he keep folks
from stealing them?

269
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,371
The Watch protects him.

270
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,640
Not today they don't.

271
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,344
He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.

272
00:17:57,378 --> 00:18:00,580
- Tormund: <i>And proper steel.</i>
- Let's carve him up.

273
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:01,982
We just take
the horses and go.

274
00:18:02,016 --> 00:18:04,685
The old man's no threat.

275
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,154
I keep telling you.

276
00:18:07,188 --> 00:18:09,323
He's an old man.

277
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,825
A spear through the heart's
a better way to die

278
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:14,373
than coughing up your last with
no one but your horses to hear.

279
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:19,199
The Watch might send a few men
looking for a horse thief.

280
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:22,102
They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.

281
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:23,971
I hope so.

282
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:26,941
Killing crows
in their castle is tough.

283
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:28,910
Killing them out here
in the open,

284
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,645
that's what we do.

285
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,413
Spread out.

286
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:35,016
Surround the hut
and move in.

287
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:01,976
- ( sword clangs )
- ( snorts )

288
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:04,479
( neighing )

289
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:19,026
Ygritte!

290
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:23,597
Man:
<i>Clear the barn!</i>

291
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:04,170
No one's going to believe you're a
hog farmer if you eat them all.

292
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:06,506
Best part of the animal.

293
00:20:11,213 --> 00:20:13,414
Don't worry.
They're still there.

294
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,251
I know
they're still there.

295
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:18,019
You check
every five minutes

296
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:20,621
like you're afraid
they're gonna move.

297
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:22,423
I'm not afraid.

298
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,692
Of course you are.

299
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:27,028
You're almost there

300
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:29,664
and you're afraid
you won't make it.

301
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:33,101
The closer you get,
the worse the fear gets.

302
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:36,572
No point in trying to hide
behind that face.

303
00:20:36,606 --> 00:20:39,508
<i>I know fear</i>
<i>when I see it.</i>

304
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,410
Seen it a lot.

305
00:20:42,712 --> 00:20:45,247
I knew fear
when I saw it in you.

306
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:49,519
You're afraid of fire.

307
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:51,288
When Beric's sword
went up in flames,

308
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:53,156
you looked like
a scared little girl.

309
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:59,129
And I know why, too.

310
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:03,434
<i>I heard what</i>
<i>your brother did to you.</i>

311
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,870
Pressed your face
to the fire

312
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:08,506
like you're a nice
juicy mutton chop.

313
00:21:12,311 --> 00:21:14,479
That give you some ideas?

314
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:19,985
Might do.

315
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:22,354
Go ahead, then.

316
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:24,756
You might get away.

317
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,326
Might even make it
there on your own.

318
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:30,629
They're just over
the river.

319
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:32,798
The closest you've
been to family

320
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,867
since Ilyn Payne
snipped your daddy's neck.

321
00:21:39,305 --> 00:21:42,307
Someday I'm gonna put
a sword through your eye

322
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:43,975
and out the back
of your skull.

323
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,655
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

324
00:21:57,689 --> 00:22:00,457
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

325
00:22:08,699 --> 00:22:12,134
How are we going
to get past the Wall?

326
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,103
My uncle said
it's 700 feet high.

327
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:16,773
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

328
00:22:19,443 --> 00:22:21,010
How did you get past it?

329
00:22:25,048 --> 00:22:27,783
Got in a boat and rowed
past the Bay of Seals.

330
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:31,019
It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.

331
00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:33,188
Some climb
straight up the ice.

332
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:36,524
Even Hodor's not strong enough to
climb the Wall with me on his back.

333
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:39,761
Hodor.

334
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:42,330
- 19 castles guard the Wall.
- <i>( thunder booms )</i>

335
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:45,734
- Only three are still manned.
- Hodor!

336
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:48,003
One of those abandoned fortresses
will give us a way through.

337
00:22:48,037 --> 00:22:50,272
My uncle said the gates were
sealed with ice and stone

338
00:22:50,306 --> 00:22:51,740
when the castles
were deserted.

339
00:22:51,774 --> 00:22:55,077
Well, we'll have
to open them up again.

340
00:22:55,111 --> 00:22:56,646
<i>( hoofbeats, horse neighs )</i>

341
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,415
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Meera: <i>There's a rider out there.</i>

342
00:23:00,718 --> 00:23:02,652
- Just one?
- <i>( thunder crashes )</i>

343
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:04,454
- Meera: <i>There's more.</i>
- Hodor!

344
00:23:04,488 --> 00:23:05,788
<i>( horses neighing )</i>

345
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:07,323
Shh. Shh.

346
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:10,093
- It's just thunder, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

347
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:12,495
Man:
I yield.

348
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:14,197
- <i>I yield.</i>
- Wildlings.

349
00:23:14,232 --> 00:23:16,867
<i>( men shouting )</i>

350
00:23:19,304 --> 00:23:20,805
Where's Shaggydog
and Summer?

351
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,840
- Hunting.
- <i>( horses neighing )</i>

352
00:23:22,908 --> 00:23:24,876
- <i>( thunder crashes )</i>
- Hodor!

353
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,211
- Shh, quiet, Hodor.
- Hodor!

354
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,246
Make him shut up.
If they hear us...

355
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:31,449
- Hush, Hodor. No-- no more Hodoring.
- Hodor!

356
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:34,385
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

357
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,753
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.

358
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:37,955
- <i>( Hodor shouting )</i>
- Bran: <i>Hodor, be quiet.</i>

359
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:39,524
<i>( thunder crashes )</i>

360
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:41,626
- Ah! Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

361
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:44,662
- Hodor! Hodor!
- Hodor, be quiet!

362
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,619
What did you do?

363
00:24:08,653 --> 00:24:11,388
Nothing.

364
00:24:11,422 --> 00:24:13,357
I don't know.

365
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:15,425
<i>( horse screaming )</i>

366
00:24:17,462 --> 00:24:19,063
What's that?

367
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:22,567
That's a horse dying.

368
00:24:32,644 --> 00:24:35,212
Man:
<i>Bring them over here.</i>

369
00:24:35,246 --> 00:24:38,415
Man #2: <i>That was the last of them.</i>
<i>The rest are dead.</i>

370
00:24:38,449 --> 00:24:40,683
Orell:
<i>I heard shouting up there.</i>

371
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:42,852
Thunder.

372
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:45,454
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

373
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:48,623
Maybe it's ghosts.
( laughs )

374
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:53,461
( eagle screeching )

375
00:24:58,534 --> 00:25:00,869
That won't
help you, grandpa.

376
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:06,908
Where you riding?

377
00:25:06,942 --> 00:25:08,943
Doesn't matter now,
does it?

378
00:25:08,978 --> 00:25:11,713
No, it doesn't
matter now.

379
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:16,818
Cut his throat or he'll
tell the crows we're here.

380
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:24,459
You understand.

381
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:26,461
Let me stand at least.

382
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,898
<i>Let me go</i>
<i>with a bit of dignity.</i>

383
00:25:34,937 --> 00:25:36,638
Make the crow kill him.

384
00:25:40,176 --> 00:25:43,579
You're one of us now.
Prove it.

385
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:50,387
The wolves are out there.

386
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,025
I can't do it by choice.

387
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:59,097
I don't know how.
It happens in my dreams.

388
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:01,233
You're a warg, Bran.

389
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,335
It's in your blood.

390
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,837
I can't.

391
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:06,772
You just did with him.

392
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,808
A wolf is nothing
compared to that.

393
00:26:16,516 --> 00:26:18,250
She looks sharp.

394
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:23,489
( muttering prayer )

395
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:29,930
Do it.

396
00:26:30,932 --> 00:26:32,399
Do it.

397
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:35,568
I told you.
He's still one of them.

398
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:39,338
Go on, boy.

399
00:26:42,242 --> 00:26:43,542
Go on!

400
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,284
( groans )

401
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:54,119
He's a crow.

402
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:56,087
<i>He'll always be a crow.</i>

403
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:58,489
And here's his crow wife
guarding him.

404
00:26:58,523 --> 00:27:01,726
He'll stab us in the back
first chance he gets.

405
00:27:04,663 --> 00:27:07,031
- Kill him.
- ( Jon shouts )

406
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:22,280
( screaming )

407
00:27:22,314 --> 00:27:24,349
- He's one of them.
- No!

408
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:25,883
Do you hear me?

409
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:27,519
( screams )

410
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:35,193
You're not gonna die
for one of them.

411
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:39,498
Do it.

412
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,366
They'll find us
if you don't.

413
00:27:41,401 --> 00:27:44,303
<i>( swords clanging )</i>

414
00:27:48,742 --> 00:27:51,411
( breathing heavily )

415
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:53,613
( growling )

416
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:03,190
( Orell shouts )

417
00:28:08,831 --> 00:28:11,032
( gasps )

418
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,034
You were right
the whole time.

419
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,702
( gasps )

420
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,637

421
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:25,678
( Jon screaming )

422
00:28:39,026 --> 00:28:40,593
Hyah!

423
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:02,282
Daario: <i>When you hear a songbird's</i>
<i>whistle, you come.</i>

424
00:29:02,316 --> 00:29:06,086
I'm a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.

425
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:14,060
- ( guard shouts in Valyrian )
- Daario Naharis.

426
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:31,078
<i>( whistling )</i>

427
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:44,323
Daario:
<i>That one was quick.</i>

428
00:29:47,093 --> 00:29:49,127
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.

429
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,030
The Yunkish prefer to let their
slaves do their fighting for them.

430
00:29:52,064 --> 00:29:54,032
( guards shouting )

431
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:39,947
That's what you call
a few guards?

432
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,187
( guards shouting )

433
00:30:53,863 --> 00:30:55,931
<i>( men shouting )</i>

434
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,341
Come on!
What do you got, huh?

435
00:31:08,244 --> 00:31:10,212
( cheering )

436
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:23,116
Lord Edmure...

437
00:32:24,786 --> 00:32:27,054
I hope I'm not
a disappointment to you.

438
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:28,689
( chuckles )

439
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:38,066
You're a delight
to me, my lady.

440
00:32:39,702 --> 00:32:41,370
You may now cloak
the bride

441
00:32:41,404 --> 00:32:43,472
and bring her under
your protection.

442
00:33:12,536 --> 00:33:14,136
In the sight of the Seven,

443
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:17,840
I hereby seal
these two souls,

444
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:21,477
binding them as one
for eternity.

445
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:24,447
<i>Look upon each other</i>
<i>and say the words.</i>

446
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:29,285
Both:
Father, Smith,

447
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:31,687
Warrior, Mother,

448
00:33:31,722 --> 00:33:34,758
Maiden, Crone,
Stranger...

449
00:33:34,792 --> 00:33:36,893
- I am hers...
- I am his...

450
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:39,062
- <i>and she is mine...</i>
- <i>and he is mine...</i>

451
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:43,100
Both: <i>...from this day</i>
<i>until the end of my days.</i>

452
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:50,675
- Is that safe?
- They're long gone.

453
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:57,647
You were right.

454
00:33:57,715 --> 00:34:00,216
I can get inside Summer's
mind whenever I want.

455
00:34:00,283 --> 00:34:02,451
Of course you can.

456
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:05,053
North of the Wall
there are wildlings

457
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:08,089
who can control
all sorts of animals.

458
00:34:08,124 --> 00:34:10,458
<i>But you did a lot</i>
<i>more than that.</i>

459
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:15,363
You got inside
Hodor's mind.

460
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:18,232
They can't do that
north of the Wall?

461
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,671
No one can do that...

462
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:23,806
<i>anywhere.</i>

463
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,115
When I was looking
through Summer's eyes,

464
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:34,816
- I saw Jon.
- Where?

465
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:36,618
He was with the wildlings.

466
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:38,687
They tried to kill him,
but he got away.

467
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:40,355
Osha: <i>He'll be heading back</i>
<i>to Castle Black, then.</i>

468
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,224
That's where we should go.

469
00:34:42,258 --> 00:34:44,626
For all we know, Castle
Black's already under attack.

470
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:47,462
- If this many wildlings got through--
- I already told you.

471
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,498
I'm not going
north of the Wall.

472
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:52,501
Everything Jojen
told me is true.

473
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:56,705
You saw what I did
to Hodor.

474
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,707
<i>I have to find</i>
<i>the three-eyed raven.</i>

475
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:00,309
Listen to me,
little lord.

476
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:01,576
Don't worry.

477
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,713
I'm not asking you
to come with me.

478
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,417
It won't be safe
for Rickon.

479
00:35:08,452 --> 00:35:11,521
Me?
I'm coming with you.

480
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:14,057
No.

481
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:16,726
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

482
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:19,963
The Umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.

483
00:35:19,998 --> 00:35:21,732
I'm coming with you.

484
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:23,634
I'm your brother.

485
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:25,970
I have to protect you.

486
00:35:27,873 --> 00:35:31,208
Right now I have
to protect you.

487
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:34,378
Robb's at war and I'm
going beyond the Wall.

488
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:36,781
If something
happens to us,

489
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:38,883
you're the heir
to Winterfell.

490
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:43,121
Would you know how
to find the Last Hearth?

491
00:35:43,155 --> 00:35:46,258
You southerners build your big
castles and you never move.

492
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:47,926
You're easy to find.

493
00:35:47,994 --> 00:35:50,696
We're not southerners.

494
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,799
And I don't want
to leave you.

495
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,635
Shh, shh.
Come here, little soldier.

496
00:35:58,104 --> 00:36:01,707
You and me, we're gonna
have some adventures.

497
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,110
You don't have to do
any of this.

498
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:05,411
( crying )

499
00:36:05,445 --> 00:36:06,912
Your family
took me in

500
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:09,282
and was good to me when
they had no cause to be.

501
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:11,651
<i>Shh.</i>

502
00:36:11,685 --> 00:36:13,953
We'll be fine,
you and me.

503
00:36:13,987 --> 00:36:16,222
The Umbers
are great warriors.

504
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,891
Even I heard
about them growing up.

505
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,294
They'll teach you
how to swing a sword.

506
00:36:21,328 --> 00:36:24,864
I know how
to swing a sword.

507
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:29,635
( kisses )

508
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:34,540
You're leaving now?
It's the middle of the night.

509
00:36:34,574 --> 00:36:36,442
I learned to walk
in darkness.

510
00:36:38,912 --> 00:36:40,613
Say your good-byes,
little man.

511
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:50,789
Keep this one safe.

512
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:54,625
He means
the world to me.

513
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:18,250
We've been waiting
a long time.

514
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:22,288
Haven't we?

515
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:25,224
I don't know,
you tell me.

516
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:27,460
How long does it take
to sack a city?

517
00:37:35,702 --> 00:37:37,803
It was just as you said.

518
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:41,239
They did not believe
until it was too late.

519
00:37:41,273 --> 00:37:43,274
Their slave soldiers

520
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:46,778
threw down their spears
and surrendered.

521
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:53,451
And Daario Naharis?

522
00:37:57,623 --> 00:38:01,059
<i>( footsteps )</i>

523
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:16,576

They're good,

527
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:43,003
They ought to be

- ( Catelyn laughs )

531
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:59,053
He complained
about this marriage

532
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,322
the entire ride
from Riverrun,

533

<i>and now look at him.</i>

534

Blackfish: <i>The gods love</i>
<i>to reward a fool.</i>

535
00:39:04,893 --> 00:39:07,394
- Uncle.
- What?

536
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,397
He's my nephew.
I love him.

537
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,433
And he's a damned fool.

538
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:14,835
( chuckles )

539
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:20,207
Don't you drink,
Lord Bolton?

540
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:22,543
Never do, my lady.
Dulls the senses.

541
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,812
That's the point.

542
00:39:24,846 --> 00:39:26,647
Didn't you marry
one of these Frey girls?

543
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:28,149
Aye.

544
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:30,251
Lord Walder let me choose
any of his granddaughters

545
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:34,388
and promised me the girl's
weight in silver as a dowry.

546
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,257
So I have
a fat young bride.

547
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,259
( laughs )

548
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,261
I hope she makes you
very happy.

549
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,096
Well, she's made me
very rich.

550
00:39:42,164 --> 00:39:44,766
Pardon, my lord,
my lady.

551
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,268
I need to find
a tree to piss on.

552
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:51,673
My mother's alone
with Roose Bolton.

553
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,141
I should rescue her.

554
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:55,109
Your mother is less
in need of rescue

555
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:57,111
than any woman
I've ever met.

556
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:58,213
Be kind.

557
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:00,248
She's finally starting
to like you.

558
00:40:01,917 --> 00:40:03,718
And I like her.

559
00:40:03,753 --> 00:40:06,955
But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis

560
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:10,258
playing my harp and you
would be sitting over there

<i>out of Roslin Frey's hand.</i>

a terrible mistake.

( scoffs )

564
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:21,303
Striking your king

No, don't.

566
00:40:27,344 --> 00:40:28,978
Don't insult them.

567

00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:51,365
has wrapped my daughter

But they are not yet
man and wife.

Every bride

I'm sure you endured
yours with grace.

594

Oh, Ned forbade it.

595

He said it wouldn't be right

That is a very
strange custom.

599
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:42,112
I suppose it does
seem strange

600
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:43,813
from a foreigner's
perspective.

601
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:45,649
It seems normal
to you?

602
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:48,085
It's a tradition.

603
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:52,789
Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

604
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:55,359
the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

605

But there are other ways
of providing proof.

606
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:02,866
Boy or girl?

607
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:06,938
I don't know.

608
00:43:06,972 --> 00:43:10,141
But if it's a boy, I know
what we should name him.

Oh, do you?

610

It seems to me the father

611
00:43:13,777 --> 00:43:15,790
should have some say in
his son's naming.

612

Eddard.
