what say you to my suit?

of assailing eyes,

to saint-seducing gold.

that she will still live chaste?

00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,631
It is the east,

490
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,964
and Juliet is the sun.

491
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,640
Arise, fair sun,

492
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,642
and kill the envious moon,

493
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,144
who is already
sick and pale with grief

494
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,614
that thou her maid
art far more fair than she.

495
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:01,618
Be not her maid,
since she is envious.

496
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,553
Her vestal livery
is but sick and green,

497
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,022
and none but fools do wear it.

498
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,926
Oh...

499
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,394
cast it off.

00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,369
[Elevator Bell Rings]

501
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,641
It is my lady. It is my love.

502
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,609
O that she knew she were.

503
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,745
Ay me.

504
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,087
[Whispering]
She speaks.

505
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,160
Speak again, bright angel.

506
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,630
Romeo.

507
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,598
O, Romeo,

508
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,134
wherefore art thou Romeo?

509
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,641
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name.

510
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:01,974
Or, if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,

511
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,038
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

512
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,550
Shall I hear more,

513
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,552
or shall I speak at this?

514
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,555
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.

515
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,024
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.

516
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,560
What's Montague?

517
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:22,599
It is not hand nor foot
nor arm nor face...

518
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:28,730
nor any other part
belonging to a man.

519
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,401
O, be some other name.

520
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,603
What's in a name?

521
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:39,082
That which we call a rose
by any other word would smell as sweet.

522
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,586
So Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,

523
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,589
retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title.

524
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,922
Romeo, doth thy name,

525
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,962
and for thy name,
which is no part of thee,

526
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,463
take all myself.

527
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,760
I take thee at thy word.

528
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,800
Aah!

529
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:09,078
Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?

530
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,047
Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.

531
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,549
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me, and wherefore?

532
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,051
The garden walls are high
and hard to climb,

533
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,554
and the place death,
considering who thou art.

534
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:21,557
With love's light wings
did I o'er perch these walls,

535
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,559
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,

536
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,221
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.

537
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,764
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me!

538
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,918
If they do see thee,

539
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,423
they will murder thee.

540
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,130
I have night's cloak to hide me

541
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:02,631
from their eyes.

542
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,636
But thou love me,
let them find me here.

543
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,639
My life were better
ended by their hate

544
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,140
than death prorogued,

545
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,112
wanting of thy love.

546
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,155
Juliet: Thou knowest
the mask of night is on my face,

547
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:01,657
else would a maiden blush
bepaint my cheek

548
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,592
for that which thou
hast heard me speak tonight.

549
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:07,129
Fain would I dwell on form-

550
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:09,632
Fain, fain deny what I have spoke.

551
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,134
But farewell compliment.

552
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,433
Dost thou love me?

553
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,143
I know thou wilt say "Ay,"
and I will take thy word.

554
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,645
Yet, if thou swearest,
thou mayst prove false.

555
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,773
O gentle Romeo, if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.

556
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,614
Lady, by yonder
blessed moon I vow,

557
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,780
that tips with silver
all these fruit-tree tops.

558
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,017
O, swear not by the moon,

559
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,615
the inconstant moon,

560
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,161
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,

561
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,164
lest that thy love
prove likewise variable.

562
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,666
What shall I swear by?

563
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:45,668
Do not swear at all.

564
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,670
Or if thou wilt,

565
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,672
swear by thy gracious self,

566
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,174
which is the god of my idolatry,

567
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,177
and I'll believe thee.

568
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:58,306
If my heart's dear love-

569
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,092
Well, do not swear.

570
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,128
Although I joy in thee,

571
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,721
I have no joy
of this contract tonight.

572
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,629
It is too rash,
too unadvised, too sudden;

573
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,134
too like the lightning,
which doth cease to be

574
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,137
ere one can say "It lightens. "

575
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,638
Sweet, good night.

576

This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath,

577
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,643
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

578
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,235
Good night.

579
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,280
Good night.

580
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:38,777
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

581
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,324
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

582
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:46,651
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.

583
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,668
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it!

If that thy bent of love be honorable,
thy purpose marriage,

send me word tomorrow by one
that I'll procure to come to thee,

where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite,

589

and all my fortunes
at thy foot I'll lay

by-and-by I come-

A thousand times the worse,
to want thy light.

Love goes toward love as schoolboys
from their books;

605
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,923
but love from love,

606
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,821
toward school with heavy looks.

00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,193

What o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?

609
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,431
By the hour of 9:00.

610
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,632
I will not fail.
'Tis twenty year till then.

614

Parting is such sweet sorrow,

that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

623

Almighty is the powerful grace
that lies in plants,

624
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,966
herbs, stones,
and their true qualities.

625
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:44,640
For naught so vile
that on the earth doth live,

626
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,575
but to the earth
some special good doth give...

627
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:53,609
and naught so good but,
strained from that fair use,

628
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:57,415
revolts from true birth,
stumbling on abuse.

629
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,614
Virtue itself turns vice,
being misapplied,

630
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:04,388
and vice sometimes
by action dignified.

631
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:08,921
Within the infant rind
of this weak flower

632
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,763
poison is resident...

633
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,769
and medicine power.

634
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:18,604
For this, being smelt,
with that part cheers each part;

635
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:24,375
being tasted,
slays all senses with the heart.

636
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:29,579
2 such opposed kings encamp
them still in man as well as herbs:

637
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,587
grace and rude will;

638
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:34,089
and where the worser is predominant,

639
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:38,652
full soon the canker death
eats up that plant.

640
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,821
Romeo: Good morrow, Father!

641
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,831
Benedicite!

642
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,132
What early tongue
so sweet saluteth me?

643
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,638
Boys: Good morrow, Romeo.

644
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,139
Romeo: Good morrow.

645
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:54,371
Young son,
it argues a distempered head

646
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:57,607
so soon to bid
good morrow to thy bed.

647
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:01,617
Or if not so,
then here I hit it right-

648
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:05,177
Our Romeo hath not
seen his bed tonight.

649
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:08,247
Romeo: The last is true.
The sweeter rest was mine.

00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,725
God pardon sin.
Wast thou with Rosaline?

651
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,728
Rosaline? My ghostly father, no.

652
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,594
I have forgot that name
and that name's woe.

653
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:17,098
That's my good son.

654
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,725
But where then hast thou been?

655
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,770
I have been feasting
with mine enemy,

656
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,602
where on a sudden one hath wounded me
that's by me wounded.

657
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,110
Both our remedies within thy help
and holy physic lies.

658
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,078
Be plain, good son,
and homely in thy drift.

659
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,614
Riddling confession
finds but riddling shrift.

660
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,914
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set

661
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,978
on the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.

662
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,581
We met, we wooed,

663
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:44,889
we made exchange of vow.

664
00:47:44,995 --> 00:47:47,088
I'll tell thee as we pass,

665
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,997
but this I pray,
that thou consent to marry us today.

666
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,971
Holy Saint Francis.

667
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,939
What a change is here.

668
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:02,308
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love
so dear, so soon forsaken?

669
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,371
Young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts,

670
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:06,939
but in their eyes.

671
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:10,043
Thou chid'st me oft
for loving Rosaline.

672
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,055
For doting, not for loving,
pupil mine.

673
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,225
I pray thee...

674
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,262
chide me not.

675
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:24,596
Her I love now doth grace for grace
and love for love allow.

676
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,602
The other did not so.

677
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,606
O, she well knew thy love
did read by rote,

678
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,642
that could not spell.

679
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:36,145
Boys Choir:
#... father, too bold #

680
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:42,413
# Maybe you're just like my mother #

681
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:47,423
# She's never satisfied... #

682
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:51,587
Friar's Voice:
For this alliance may so happy prove

683
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:57,123
to turn your households' rancor
to pure love.

684
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,135
#This is what it sounds like #

685
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:06,075
#When doves cry... #

686
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,078
Come, young waverer.
Come, go with me.

687
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,047
In one respect I'll thy assistant be.

688
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,711
For this alliance may so happy prove

689
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,221
to turn your households'
rancor to pure love.

690
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,757
O, let us hence!
I stand on sudden haste!

691
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,988
# How could you
leave me standing?... #

692
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,586
Wisely and slow.

693
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,427
<i>They stumble that run fast.</i>

694
00:49:29,533 --> 00:49:32,969
# Maybe I'm just too demanding #

695
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,938
# Maybe I'm just like my father,
too bold #

696
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:40,443
# Maybe I'm just like my mother #

697
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:44,606
# She's never satisfied #

698
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:48,247
#Why do we scream at each other? #

699
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,252
#This is what it sounds like #

700
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,915
#When doves cry #

701
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:57,688
#Yeah, yeah #

702
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,088
#This is what it sounds like #

703
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,964
#This is what it sounds like #

704
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,502
#This is what it sounds like ##

705
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:11,302
Where the devil
should this Romeo be?

706
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,275
Came he not home tonight?

707
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,312
Not to his father's.
I spoke with his man.

708
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,611
Why, that same pale,
hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,

709
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,948
torments him so
that he will sure run mad.

710
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,614
Tybalt hath sent a letter
to his father's house.

711
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,281
A challenge, on my life.

712
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,790
Romeo will answer it?

713
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,123
Any man that can write
may answer a letter.

714
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:34,652
Nay, he will answer the letter's master,
how he dares, being dared.

715
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:38,292
Alas, poor Romeo,
he is already dead!

716
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,131
Stabbed with a white wench's
black eye,

717
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,296
run through the ear
with a love song,

718
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,637
the very pin of his heart cleft with
the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft.

719
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,075
Mercutio: And is he a man
to encounter Tybalt?

720
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,373
Why, what is Tybalt?

721
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,471
More than Prince of Cats.

722
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:55,678
He is the courageous
captain of compliments.

723
00:50:55,752 --> 00:51:00,052
He fights as you sing prick-song-

724
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:03,786
keeps time, distance, and proportion.

725
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,090
He rests his minim rests,

726
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,130
one, two...

727
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,632
and the third in your bosom.
