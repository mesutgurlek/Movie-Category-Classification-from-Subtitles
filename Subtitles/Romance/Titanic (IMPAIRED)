00:02:32.50,00:02:36.00
Okay ,  take her up  [br]  and over the bow rail.

00:02:36.50,00:02:39.00
( Over Radio): [br] Okay ,  Mir2 , we're going over the bow.

00:02:39.50,00:02:41.00

00:03:14.50,00:03:17.00
Okay ,  quiet. We're rolling.

00:03:17.50,00:03:20.00
Seeing her coming out of [br] the darkness like a ghost ship

00:03:20.50,00:03:22.00
still gets me every time--

00:03:22.50,00:03:28.00
To see the sad ruin [br] of the great ship sitting here

00:03:28.50,00:03:33.00
where she landed at 2:30 [br] in the morning of April 1 5 ,  1 91 2

00:03:33.50,00:03:37.00
after her long fall [br] from the world above.

00:04:20.50,00:04:21.00

The pressure outside is [br] 3 1/2 tons per square inch.

00:04:24.50,00:04:27.00
These windows are nine inches thick [br] and if they go

00:04:27.50,00:04:31.00
it's sayonara [br] in two microseconds.

00:04:31.50,00:04:33.00

00:05:11.50,00:05:14.00
Man ( Over Radio): Okay ,  Brock ,  [br] we're dropping down along the hull.

00:05:14.50,00:05:16.00


00:05:16.50,00:05:20.00

Brock: [br] Snoop Dog is on the move.

00:05:47.50,00:05:49.00
We're headed down the stairwell.

00:05:49.50,00:05:52.00


00:05:52.50,00:05:55.00
Okay ,  Lewis ,  drop down to B deck. [br] A deck.

Who's the best ,  baby? [br] Say it. Say it.

Shit.

00:10:00.50,00:10:03.00
No diamond.

00:10:03.50,00:10:06.00
You know ,  boss ,  this same thing [br] happened to Geraldo

00:10:06.50,00:10:08.00
and his career never recovered.

00:10:08.50,00:10:11.00


00:10:11.50,00:10:13.00
Turn the camera off.

Bobby: Brock ,  the partners [br] would like to know how it's going.

00:10:18.50,00:10:21.00
Hey ,  Dave ,  Barry ,  hi. [br] Look ,  it wasn't in the safe

00:10:21.50,00:10:23.00
but hey ,  hey ,  [br] don't worry about it.

00:10:23.50,00:10:25.00
There's still plenty [br] of places it could be.

00:10:25.50,00:10:30.00
Hell yes! Floor debris in the suite ,  the [br] mother's room ,  purser's safe on C deck.

00:10:30.50,00:10:33.00
Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase. [br] Brock: A dozen other places.

00:10:33.50,00:10:36.00
Guys ,  look , you've just got to trust [br] my instincts. I know we're close.

00:10:36.50,00:10:40.00
We just got to go through [br] a little process of elimination.

00:10:40.50,00:10:42.00
Hang on a second.

00:10:42.50,00:10:45.00


00:10:45.50,00:10:48.00
- Let me see that. [br] - We might have something here ,  guys.

00:10:48.50,00:10:49.00


00:10:49.50,00:10:51.00
Where's the photograph [br] of the necklace?

00:10:51.50,00:10:52.00


00:10:52.50,00:10:54.00
We'll call you right back.

00:10:54.50,00:11:05.00


00:11:05.50,00:11:07.00
I'll be goddamned.

Reporter: Treasure hunter Brock Lovett [br] is best known for finding Spanish gold.

00:11:13.50,00:11:15.00
It's okay. [br] I'll feed you in a minute.

00:11:15.50,00:11:16.00


00:11:16.50,00:11:18.00
Now he has chartered [br] Russian subs to reach

00:11:18.50,00:11:21.00
the most famous ship wreck [br] of all: the Titanic.

00:11:21.50,00:11:23.00
He is with us live [br] via satellite

00:11:23.50,00:11:26.00
from the research ship Keldysh [br] in the North Atlantic.

00:11:26.50,00:11:29.00
- Hello ,  Brock. [br] - Brock: Hello ,  Tracy.

00:11:29.50,00:11:31.00
Everyone knows the familiar [br] stories of Titanic--

00:11:31.50,00:11:34.00
the nobility ,  the band playing [br] till the very end and all that.

00:11:34.50,00:11:37.00
But what I'm interested in [br] are the untold stories

00:11:37.50,00:11:40.00
the secrets locked deep [br] inside the hull of Titanic.

00:11:40.50,00:11:42.00
We're out here using [br] robot technology

00:11:42.50,00:11:46.00
to go further into the wreck [br] than anybody's ever done before.

00:11:46.50,00:11:49.00
Your expedition is at the center [br] of a storm of controversy

00:11:49.50,00:11:51.00
over salvage rights [br] and even ethics.

00:11:51.50,00:11:53.00
Many are calling you [br] a grave robber.

00:11:53.50,00:11:57.00
Nobody called the recovery of artifacts [br] of King Tut's tomb "grave robbing."

00:11:57.50,00:11:59.00
- Woman: What is it? [br] - Turn that up ,  dear.

00:11:59.50,00:12:02.00
I have museum-trained experts [br] out here making sure

00:12:02.50,00:12:04.00
that these relics are preserved [br] and catalogued properly.

00:12:04.50,00:12:05.00


00:12:05.50,00:12:07.00
Take a look at this drawing [br] that we found just today:

00:12:07.50,00:12:12.00
A piece of paper that's been [br] under water for 84 years

00:12:12.50,00:12:15.00
and my team were able [br] to preserve it intact.

00:12:15.50,00:12:20.00
Should this have remained unseen at [br] the bottom of the ocean for eternity?

00:12:20.50,00:12:22.00
I'll be goddamned.

00:12:22.50,00:12:25.00
Man (Over Loud speaker): [br] Vnimanye ,  vnimanye...

00:12:25.50,00:12:29.00
Bobby: Brock! [br] There's a satellite call for you.

00:12:29.50,00:12:32.00
Bobby ,  we're launching. You see [br] these submersibles going in the water?

00:12:32.50,00:12:35.00
Trust me ,  buddy. [br] You want to take this call.

00:12:35.50,00:12:36.00


00:12:36.50,00:12:38.00
This better be good.

00:12:38.50,00:12:39.00


00:12:39.50,00:12:42.00
You got to speak up. [br] She's kind of old.

00:12:42.50,00:12:45.00
Great. This Brock Lovett.

00:12:45.50,00:12:46.00


00:12:46.50,00:12:49.00
- How can I help you ,  Mrs.-- [br] - Calvert. Rose Calvert.

00:12:49.50,00:12:51.00
Mrs. Calvert?

00:12:51.50,00:12:57.00
I was just wondering if you had found [br] the Heart of the Ocean yet ,  Mr. Lovett.

00:12:57.50,00:12:58.00


00:12:58.50,00:13:01.00
Told you you wanted [br] to take the call.

00:13:01.50,00:13:03.00


00:13:03.50,00:13:05.00
All right , you have [br] my attention ,  Rose.

00:13:05.50,00:13:06.00


00:13:06.50,00:13:09.00
Can you tell us who the woman [br] in the picture is?

00:13:09.50,00:13:13.00
Oh , yes. [br] The woman in the picture is me.

00:13:13.50,00:13:29.00


00:13:29.50,00:13:30.00
( Yelling Over Engine Noise): [br] She's a goddamned liar--

00:13:30.50,00:13:31.00


00:13:31.50,00:13:33.00
Some nut case seeking [br] money or publicity.

00:13:33.50,00:13:37.00
God only knows why ,  like that [br] Russian babe ,  Anesthesia.

00:13:37.50,00:13:39.00
They're inbound!

00:13:39.50,00:13:44.00


00:13:44.50,00:13:48.00
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic [br] when she was 1 7 ,  right?

00:13:48.50,00:13:52.00
- That's right. [br] - If she had lived ,  she'd be over 1 00.

00:13:52.50,00:13:54.00
101 next month.

00:13:54.50,00:13:57.00
Okay ,  so she's a very old [br] goddamned liar.

00:13:57.50,00:13:58.00


00:13:58.50,00:14:00.00
Look ,  I've already done [br] the background on this woman

00:14:00.50,00:14:04.00
all the way back to the '20s [br] when she was working as an actress.

00:14:04.50,00:14:07.00
An actress! There's [br] your first clue ,  Sherlock.

00:14:07.50,00:14:12.00
Her name was Rose Dawson back then. [br] Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

Now ,  Calvert's dead ,  and from what [br] I hear ,  Cedar Rapids is dead.

00:14:19.50,00:14:21.00
And everybody who [br] knows about the diamond

00:14:21.50,00:14:25.00
is supposed to be dead [br] or on this boat ,  but she knows.

Mrs. Calvert ,  I'm Brock Lovett. [br] Welcome to the Keldysh.

00:14:45.50,00:14:47.00


00:14:47.50,00:14:50.00
Okay ,  let's get her [br] inside there.

00:14:50.50,00:14:52.00
- Hi ,  Ms. Calvert. [br] - Hi.

00:14:52.50,00:14:55.00

- Are your staterooms all right? [br] - Rose: Oh , yes ,  very nice.

00:15:09.50,00:15:12.00
Have you met [br] my grand daughter Lizzie?

00:15:12.50,00:15:15.00
She takes care of me.

00:15:15.50,00:15:17.00
We met just [br] a few minutes ago.

00:15:17.50,00:15:19.00
Remember ,  Nana ,  up on deck?

00:15:19.50,00:15:22.00
There ,  that's nice.

00:15:22.50,00:15:25.00
Have to have my pictures [br] when I travel.

00:15:25.50,00:15:27.00
Can I get you anything? [br] Is there anything you'd like?

00:15:27.50,00:15:29.00


00:15:29.50,00:15:31.00
Yes.

00:15:31.50,00:15:33.00
I would like to see my drawing.

00:15:33.50,00:15:46.00


00:15:46.50,00:15:49.00
Brock: [br] Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone

00:15:49.50,00:15:52.00
that was called [br] the Blue Diamond of the Crown

00:15:52.50,00:15:55.00
which disappeared in 1 792

00:15:55.50,00:15:59.00
about the same time old Louis [br] lost everything from the neck up.

00:15:59.50,00:16:03.00
The theory goes that [br] the crown diamond was chopped ,  too

00:16:03.50,00:16:07.00
recut into a heart-like shape that [br] became known as "Heart of the Ocean."

00:16:07.50,00:16:10.00
Today it would be worth more [br] than the Hope Diamond.

00:16:10.50,00:16:14.00
It was a dreadful ,  heavy thing. [br] I only wore it this once.

00:16:14.50,00:16:18.00
Lizzie: [br] You actually think this is you ,  Nana?

00:16:18.50,00:16:22.00
It is me ,  dear. [br] Wasn't I a dish?

00:16:22.50,00:16:24.00


00:16:24.50,00:16:26.00
I tracked it down [br] through insurance records--

00:16:26.50,00:16:30.00
An old claim that was settled [br] under terms of absolute secrecy.

00:16:30.50,00:16:32.00


00:16:32.50,00:16:34.00
Can you tell me [br] who the claimant was ,  Rose?

00:16:34.50,00:16:37.00
I should imagine [br] someone named Hockley.

00:16:37.50,00:16:41.00
Brock: Nathan Hockley ,  that's right. [br] Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

00:16:41.50,00:16:42.00


00:16:42.50,00:16:43.00
Claim was for [br] a diamond necklace

00:16:43.50,00:16:44.00


00:16:44.50,00:16:47.00
his son Caledon [br] bought his fiancée--you

00:16:47.50,00:16:50.00
a week before [br] he sailed on Titanic.

00:16:50.50,00:16:54.00
It was filed right [br] after the sinking

00:16:54.50,00:16:57.00
so the diamond had to have [br] gone down with the ship.

00:16:57.50,00:16:58.00


00:16:58.50,00:17:01.00
You see the date?

00:17:01.50,00:17:03.00
"April 1 4 ,  1 91 2."

00:17:03.50,00:17:06.00
Which means if your grandmother is [br] who she says she is

00:17:06.50,00:17:09.00
she was wearing the diamond [br] the day the Titanic sank.

00:17:09.50,00:17:13.00
And that makes you [br] my new best friend.

00:17:13.50,00:17:17.00
These are some of the things [br] we recovered from your stateroom.

00:17:17.50,00:17:19.00


00:17:19.50,00:17:22.00
This was mine.

00:17:22.50,00:17:25.00
How extraordinary!

00:17:25.50,00:17:29.00
And it looks the same as it did [br] the last time I saw it.

00:17:29.50,00:17:34.00


00:17:34.50,00:17:37.00
The reflection [br] has changed a bit.

00:17:37.50,00:17:41.00


00:17:41.50,00:17:43.00
( Gasps Quietly)

00:17:43.50,00:17:53.00


00:17:53.50,00:17:56.00
Are you ready to go [br] back to Titanic?

00:17:56.50,00:17:59.00


00:17:59.50,00:18:04.00
Lewis: Okay ,  here we go. She hits [br] the berg on the starboard side ,  right?

00:18:04.50,00:18:07.00
She kind of bumps along punching holes [br] like Morse code-- dit-dit-dit--

00:18:07.50,00:18:10.00
along the side ,  [br] below the waterline.

00:18:10.50,00:18:12.00
Then the forward compartments [br] start to flood.

00:18:12.50,00:18:16.00
Now as the water level rises ,  it [br] spills over the watertight bulkheads

00:18:16.50,00:18:19.00
which unfortunately [br] don't go any higher than E deck.

00:18:19.50,00:18:23.00
So now as the bow goes down ,  [br] the stern rises up

00:18:23.50,00:18:26.00
slow at first ,  then faster [br] and faster until finally

00:18:26.50,00:18:29.00
she's got her whole ass is sticking [br] up in the air and that's a big ass.

00:18:29.50,00:18:33.00
We're talking [br] 20 , 000 ,  30 , 000 tons ,  okay?

00:18:33.50,00:18:37.00
And the hull's not designed to deal [br] with that pressure ,  so what happens?

00:18:37.50,00:18:39.00
She splits ,  [br] right down to the keel

00:18:39.50,00:18:40.00


00:18:40.50,00:18:42.00
and the stern [br] falls back level.

00:18:42.50,00:18:48.00
Then as the bow sinks ,  it pulls the [br] stern vertical and finally detaches.

00:18:48.50,00:18:51.00
Now ,  the stern section just [br] kind of bobs there like a cork

00:18:51.50,00:18:56.00
for a couple of minutes ,  floods and [br] finally goes under about 2:20 a.m.

00:18:56.50,00:18:59.00
two hours and 40 minutes [br] after the collision.

00:18:59.50,00:19:03.00
The bow section planes away [br] landing about a half a mile away

00:19:03.50,00:19:06.00
going 20 ,  30 knots when [br] it hits the ocean floor.

00:40:28.50,00:40:30.00
Well ,  they have some [br] of the coldest winters around.

00:40:30.50,00:40:33.00
I grew up there [br] near Chippewa Falls.

00:40:33.50,00:40:37.00
I remember when I was a kid ,  [br] me and my father ,  we went ice fishing

00:40:37.50,00:40:38.00


00:40:38.50,00:40:39.00
out on Lake Wissota.

00:40:39.50,00:40:40.00


00:40:40.50,00:40:42.00
Ice fishing is ,  you know ,  [br] where you--

00:40:42.50,00:40:44.00
( Angrily): [br] I know what ice fishing is!

00:40:44.50,00:40:47.00
Sorry.

00:40:47.50,00:40:52.00
You just seem like ,  you know ,  [br] kind of an indoor girl.

00:40:52.50,00:40:55.00
Anyway ,  I ,  uh... 

00:40:55.50,00:40:57.00
I fell through some thin ice

00:40:57.50,00:41:00.00
and I'm telling you...

00:41:00.50,00:41:04.00
water that cold ,  [br] like right down there

00:41:04.50,00:41:08.00
it hits you like a thousand knives [br] stabbing you all over your body.

00:41:08.50,00:41:12.00
You can't breathe ,  [br] you can't think--

00:41:12.50,00:41:13.00


00:41:13.50,00:41:16.00
at least not about anything [br] but the pain.

00:41:16.50,00:41:19.00


00:41:19.50,00:41:23.00
Which is why I'm not looking forward [br] to jumping in there after you.

00:41:23.50,00:41:26.00
Like I said...

00:41:26.50,00:41:28.00
I don't have a choice.

00:41:28.50,00:41:32.00


00:41:32.50,00:41:35.00
I guess I'm kind of hoping [br] you'll come back over the rail

00:41:35.50,00:41:37.00
and get me off the hook here.

00:41:37.50,00:41:40.00
You're crazy.

00:41:40.50,00:41:45.00
That's what everybody says ,  [br] but with all due respect ,  miss

00:41:45.50,00:41:48.00
I'm not the one hanging off [br] the back of a ship here.

00:41:48.50,00:41:49.00


00:41:49.50,00:41:51.00
Come on.

00:41:51.50,00:41:55.00
Come on ,  give me your hand. [br] You don't want to do this.

00:41:55.50,00:42:09.00


00:42:09.50,00:42:11.00

00:42:43.50,00:42:47.00
I've got you. I won't let go. [br] Now pull yourself up. Come on.

00:42:47.50,00:42:49.00
( Grunts)

00:42:49.50,00:42:52.00
Come on. That's right.

00:42:52.50,00:42:55.00
You can do it.

00:42:55.50,00:42:59.00


00:42:59.50,00:43:01.00
I got you.

00:43:01.50,00:43:05.00


00:43:05.50,00:43:08.00
What's all this?

00:43:08.50,00:43:13.00


00:43:13.50,00:43:18.00
You stand back! [br] And don't move an inch!

00:43:18.50,00:43:21.00
- Fetch the master-at-arms! [br] - Care for a brandy?

00:43:21.50,00:43:24.00
Cal: This is completely unacceptable! [br] What made you think

00:43:24.50,00:43:26.00
that you could put your hands [br] on my fiancée?

00:43:26.50,00:43:28.00


00:43:28.50,00:43:30.00
- Look at me ,  you filth! [br] - Cal...

00:43:30.50,00:43:33.00
- What do you think you were doing? [br] - Cal ,  stop.

00:43:33.50,00:43:34.00


00:43:34.50,00:43:37.00
- It was an accident. [br] - An accident?

00:43:37.50,00:43:41.00
It was. Stupid really.

00:43:41.50,00:43:44.00
I was leaning over ,  [br] and I slipped.

00:43:44.50,00:43:46.00


00:43:46.50,00:43:50.00
I was leaning far over [br] to see the ,  uh...

00:43:50.50,00:43:53.00
uh... uh... [br] the ,  uh... uh...

00:43:53.50,00:43:56.00
- Propellers? [br] - propellers and I slipped.

00:43:56.50,00:44:00.00
And I would have gone overboard [br] but Mr. Dawson here saved me

00:44:00.50,00:44:02.00
and almost went over himself.

00:44:02.50,00:44:05.00
You wanted to see... [br] She wanted to see the propellers.

00:44:05.50,00:44:08.00
Like I said ,  [br] women and machinery do not mix.

00:44:08.50,00:44:11.00
Was that the way of it?

00:44:11.50,00:44:13.00


00:44:13.50,00:44:15.00
Yeah. Yeah ,  [br] that was pretty much it.

00:44:15.50,00:44:19.00
Well ,  the boy's a hero then. [br] Good for you ,  son. Well done.

00:44:19.50,00:44:24.00
So it's all's well [br] and back to our brandy ,  eh?

00:44:24.50,00:44:28.00
Look at you. You must be freezing. [br] Let's get you inside.

00:44:28.50,00:44:30.00
Perhaps a little something [br] for the boy.

00:44:30.50,00:44:33.00


00:44:33.50,00:44:38.00
Of course. Mr. Lovejoy ,  [br] I think a 20 should do it.

00:44:38.50,00:44:41.00
Is that the going rate [br] for saving the woman you love?

00:44:41.50,00:44:42.00


00:44:42.50,00:44:46.00
Rose is displeased. [br] What to do?

00:44:46.50,00:44:47.00


00:44:47.50,00:44:49.00
I know.

00:44:49.50,00:44:51.00


00:44:51.50,00:44:54.00
Perhaps you could join us [br] for dinner tomorrow evening

00:44:54.50,00:44:59.00
to regale our group [br] with...your heroic tale.

00:44:59.50,00:45:01.00


00:45:01.50,00:45:03.00
Sure ,  count me in.

00:45:03.50,00:45:06.00
Good. Settled then.

00:45:06.50,00:45:09.00
This should be interesting. Mmm.

00:45:20.50,00:45:29.00


00:45:29.50,00:45:31.00
You'll want to tie those.

00:45:31.50,00:45:32.00


00:45:32.50,00:45:34.00
It's interesting.

00:45:34.50,00:45:37.00
The young lady slips so suddenly [br] and you still had time

00:45:37.50,00:45:40.00
to remove your jacket [br] and your shoes.

00:45:52.50,00:45:56.00


00:45:56.50,00:45:59.00
I know you've been melancholy.

00:45:59.50,00:46:02.00
I don't pretend to know why.

00:46:02.50,00:46:03.00


00:46:03.50,00:46:06.00
I intended to save this

00:46:06.50,00:46:10.00
until the engagement gala

00:46:10.50,00:46:12.00
next week.

00:46:12.50,00:46:16.00
But I thought tonight.

00:46:16.50,00:46:17.00


00:46:17.50,00:46:19.00
Good gracious.

00:46:19.50,00:46:22.00
Perhaps as a reminder [br] of my feelings for you.

00:46:22.50,00:46:25.00
- Is it a... [br] - Diamond? Yes.

00:46:25.50,00:46:27.00


00:46:27.50,00:46:30.00
56 carats to be exact.

00:46:30.50,00:46:32.00


00:46:32.50,00:46:35.00
It was worn by Louis XVI

and they called it [br] "Le Coeur De La Mer. "

Both: [br] The Heart of the Ocean.

00:46:40.50,00:46:42.00
Yes.

00:46:42.50,00:46:47.00


00:46:47.50,00:46:49.00
It's overwhelming.

00:46:49.50,00:46:52.00
Well ,  it's for royalty.

00:46:52.50,00:46:54.00
We are royalty ,  Rose.

00:46:54.50,00:46:58.00


00:46:58.50,00:47:01.00
You know ,  there's nothing [br] I couldn't give you.

00:47:01.50,00:47:04.00
There's nothing I'd deny you

00:47:04.50,00:47:07.00
if you would not deny me.

00:47:07.50,00:47:10.00


00:47:10.50,00:47:12.00
Now open your heart [br] to me ,  Rose.

00:47:12.50,00:47:28.00


00:47:28.50,00:47:31.00
Jack: Well ,  I've been on my own since [br] I was 1 5 since my folks died.

00:47:31.50,00:47:33.00


00:47:33.50,00:47:35.00
And I had no [br] brothers or sisters

00:47:35.50,00:47:37.00
or close kin in that part [br] of the country.

00:47:37.50,00:47:41.00
So I lit on out of there [br] and I haven't been back since.

00:47:41.50,00:47:45.00
You could just call me [br] a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

00:47:45.50,00:47:46.00


00:47:46.50,00:47:48.00
Well ,  Rose...

00:47:48.50,00:47:50.00
we've walked about a mile [br] around this boat deck

00:47:50.50,00:47:54.00
and chewed over how great [br] the weather's been and how I grew up

00:47:54.50,00:47:57.00
but I reckon that's not why [br] you came to talk to me ,  is it?

00:47:57.50,00:47:59.00


00:47:59.50,00:48:01.00
- Mr. Dawson ,  l-- [br] -Jack.

00:48:01.50,00:48:04.00
Jack...

00:48:04.50,00:48:07.00
I want to thank you [br] for what you did.

00:48:07.50,00:48:11.00
Not just for... for pulling me back [br] but for your discretion.

00:48:11.50,00:48:12.00


00:48:12.50,00:48:14.00
You're welcome.

00:48:14.50,00:48:19.00
Look ,  I know [br] what you must be thinking.

00:48:19.50,00:48:23.00
Poor little rich girl. [br] What does she know about misery?

00:48:23.50,00:48:27.00
No. No ,  that's not what [br] I was thinking.

00:48:27.50,00:48:28.00


00:48:28.50,00:48:30.00
What I was thinking was [br] what could have happened to this girl

00:48:30.50,00:48:33.00
to make her think [br] she had no way out?

00:48:33.50,00:48:35.00


00:48:35.50,00:48:37.00
Well ,  l--

00:48:37.50,00:48:39.00
It was everything.

00:48:39.50,00:48:43.00
It was my whole world [br] and all the people in it

00:48:43.50,00:48:45.00
and the inertia of my life [br] plunging ahead

00:48:45.50,00:48:48.00
and me ,  powerless to stop it.

00:48:48.50,00:48:50.00
God! Look at that thing.

00:48:50.50,00:48:53.00
You would have gone [br] straight to the bottom.

00:48:53.50,00:48:55.00


00:48:55.50,00:48:57.00

All of Philadelphia society [br] will be there

00:49:00.50,00:49:02.00
and all the while [br] I feel I'm...

00:49:02.50,00:49:05.00
standing in the middle [br] of a crowded room

00:49:05.50,00:49:08.00
screaming at the top of my lungs [br] and no one even looks up.

00:49:08.50,00:49:09.00


00:49:09.50,00:49:12.00
Do you love him?

00:49:12.50,00:49:15.00
- Pardon me? [br] - Do you love him?

00:49:15.50,00:49:18.00
You're being very rude. [br] You shouldn't be asking me this.

00:49:18.50,00:49:22.00
Well ,  it's a simple question. [br] Do you love the guy or not?

00:49:22.50,00:49:23.00


00:49:23.50,00:49:26.00
This is not [br] a suitable conversation.

00:49:26.50,00:49:30.00
-Why can't you just answer the question? [br] -( Nervous Laughter)

00:49:30.50,00:49:33.00
This is absurd. You don't know me ,  [br] and I don't know you

00:49:33.50,00:49:36.00
and we are not having [br] this conversation at all.

00:49:36.50,00:49:40.00
You are rude and uncouth [br] and presumptuous and I am leaving now.

00:49:40.50,00:49:41.00


00:49:41.50,00:49:43.00
Jack. Mr. Dawson ,  [br] it's been a pleasure.

00:49:43.50,00:49:46.00
I sought you out to thank you [br] and now I have thanked you...

00:49:46.50,00:49:49.00
- And you've insulted me. [br] - Well ,  you deserved it.

00:49:49.50,00:49:52.00
- Right. [br] - Right.

00:49:52.50,00:49:54.00


00:49:54.50,00:49:57.00
- I thought you were leaving. [br] - I am.

00:49:57.50,00:49:58.00


00:49:58.50,00:50:01.00
You are so annoying.

00:50:01.50,00:50:02.00
- ( Chuckles) [br] - Wait.

00:50:02.50,00:50:07.00
I don't have to leave. [br] This is my part of the ship. You leave.

00:50:07.50,00:50:09.00
Oh-ho-ho ,  [br] well ,  well ,  well.

00:50:09.50,00:50:12.00
Now who's being rude?

00:50:12.50,00:50:15.00

00:50:34.50,00:50:40.00


00:50:40.50,00:50:43.00
Jack ,  this is exquisite work.

00:50:46.50,00:50:51.00

00:50:51.50,00:50:53.00

00:50:56.50,00:50:59.00

00:51:18.50,00:51:23.00

You liked this woman.

00:51:25.50,00:51:29.00
You used her several times.

00:51:29.50,00:51:33.00
Well ,  she had beautiful hands ,  [br] you see?

00:51:33.50,00:51:35.00


00:51:35.50,00:51:37.00
I think you must have had [br] a love affair with her.

00:51:37.50,00:51:40.00
No ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no. [br] Just with her hands.

00:51:40.50,00:51:41.00


00:51:41.50,00:51:43.00

00:51:54.50,00:51:56.00


00:51:56.50,00:51:59.00
Oh ,  and this lady...

00:51:59.50,00:52:02.00
she used to sit [br] at this bar every night

00:52:02.50,00:52:03.00


00:52:03.50,00:52:05.00
wearing every piece [br] of jewelry she owned

00:52:05.50,00:52:07.00

00:52:07.50,00:52:08.00


00:52:08.50,00:52:10.00
Called her Madame Bijou.

00:52:10.50,00:52:14.00
See how her clothes [br] are all moth-eaten?

00:52:14.50,00:52:17.00
Well ,  you have a gift ,  Jack.

00:52:17.50,00:52:20.00
You do. You see people.

00:52:20.50,00:52:23.00
I see you.

00:52:23.50,00:52:24.00

And?

00:52:42.50,00:52:46.00
Quickly ,  get up [br] before she sits with us.

00:52:46.50,00:52:49.00
Hello ,  girls. I was hoping [br] I'd catch you at tea.

00:52:49.50,00:52:51.00
We're awfully sorry [br] you missed it.

00:52:51.50,00:52:54.00
The countess and I were just off [br] to take the air on the boat deck.

00:52:54.50,00:52:57.00
What a lovely idea. [br] I need to catch up on my gossip.

So you've not yet [br] lit the last four boilers?

00:53:06.50,00:53:10.00
No ,  I don't see the need. [br] We are making excellent time.

00:53:10.50,00:53:13.00
The press knows [br] the size of Titanic.

00:53:13.50,00:53:16.00
Now I want them to marvel [br] at her speed.

00:53:16.50,00:53:19.00
We must give them [br] something new to print.

00:53:19.50,00:53:20.00


00:53:20.50,00:53:24.00
This maiden voyage of Titanic [br] must make headlines.

00:53:24.50,00:53:29.00
Mr. Ismay ,  I would prefer [br] not to push the engines

00:53:29.50,00:53:32.00
until they've been [br] properly run in.

00:53:32.50,00:53:34.00
Of course [br] I'm just a passenger.

00:53:34.50,00:53:37.00
I leave it to your good offices [br] to decide what's best.

00:53:37.50,00:53:40.00
But what a glorious end [br] to your final crossing

00:53:40.50,00:53:43.00
if we were to get into New York [br] on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

00:53:43.50,00:53:47.00

00:53:47.50,00:53:51.00


00:53:51.50,00:53:53.00
Good man.

00:53:53.50,00:53:57.00
Well ,  after that I worked on [br] a squid boat in Monterey.

00:53:57.50,00:54:00.00
Then I went down to Los Angeles [br] to the pier in Santa Monica

00:54:00.50,00:54:04.00
and started doing portraits there [br] for ten cents a piece.

00:54:04.50,00:54:08.00
Why can't I be like you ,  Jack-- [br] just head out for the horizon

00:54:08.50,00:54:11.00
whenever I feel like it?

00:54:11.50,00:54:14.00
Say we'll go there [br] sometime to that pier

00:54:14.50,00:54:16.00
even if we only [br] ever just talk about it.

00:54:16.50,00:54:18.00
No ,  we'll do it.

00:54:18.50,00:54:23.00
We'll drink cheap beer. We'll ride [br] on the roller coaster till we throw up.

00:54:23.50,00:54:26.00
Then we'll ride horses on the beach [br] right in the surf.

00:54:26.50,00:54:30.00
But you'll have to do it like a real [br] cowboy. None of that sidesaddle stuff.

00:54:30.50,00:54:34.00
- You mean ,  one leg on each side? [br] - Yeah.

00:54:34.50,00:54:38.00
- Can you show me? [br] - Sure... if you like.

00:54:38.50,00:54:39.00


00:54:39.50,00:54:44.00
- Teach me to ride like a man. [br] - And chew tobacco like a man.

00:54:44.50,00:54:46.00
And spit like a man.

00:54:46.50,00:54:48.00

00:54:48.50,00:54:52.00
- No. [br] - Well ,  come on ,  I'll show you.

about the man [br] who had saved my life

No-- the Chippewa Falls Dawsons ,  [br] actually.

01:01:06.50,01:01:08.00
Oh ,  yes. Yes.

01:01:08.50,01:01:09.00


01:01:09.50,01:01:14.00
He must have been nervous ,  [br] but he never faltered.

01:01:14.50,01:01:16.00
They assumed [br] he was one of them--

01:01:16.50,01:01:20.00
Heir to a rail road fortune ,  [br] perhaps.

01:01:20.50,01:01:25.00
New money ,  obviously ,  [br] but still a member of the club.

01:01:25.50,01:01:28.00
Mother ,  of course ,  [br] could always be counted upon.

01:01:28.50,01:01:32.00
Tell us of the accommodations [br] in steerage ,  Mr. Dawson.

01:01:32.50,01:01:34.00
I hear they're quite good [br] on this ship.

01:01:34.50,01:01:39.00
The best I've seen ,  ma'am. [br] Hardly any rats.

Mr. Dawson is joining us [br] from the third class.

01:01:44.50,01:01:48.00
He was of some assistance [br] to my fiancée last night.

01:01:48.50,01:01:50.00
It turns out that Mr. Dawson [br] is quite a fine artist.

01:01:50.50,01:01:53.00
He was kind enough to show me [br] some of his work today.

01:01:53.50,01:01:56.00
Rose and I differ somewhat [br] in our definition off art.

01:01:56.50,01:01:58.00
Not to impugn your work ,  sir.

but in the eyes of God ,  [br] she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

01:02:09.50,01:02:11.00
( Whispering): [br] Are these all for me?

01:02:11.50,01:02:13.00
Just start from the outside [br] and work your way in.

01:02:13.50,01:02:16.00

And where ,  exactly ,  [br] Do you live ,  Mr. Dawson?

01:02:32.50,01:02:35.00
Well ,  right now ,  my address [br] is the R.M.S. Titanic.

01:02:35.50,01:02:37.00

01:02:37.50,01:02:38.00

And how is it [br] you have means to travel?

01:02:40.50,01:02:42.00
I work my way [br] from place to place--

01:02:42.50,01:02:44.00
You know ,  [br] tramp steamers and such.

01:02:44.50,01:02:47.00
But I won my ticket [br] on Titanic here

01:02:47.50,01:02:49.00
at a lucky hand at poker.

01:02:49.50,01:02:52.00

01:03:04.50,01:03:06.00


01:03:06.50,01:03:08.00
Well ,  yes ,  ma'am ,  I do.

Got air in my lungs [br] and a few blank sheets of paper.

or who I'm going to meet ,  [br] where I'm going to wind up.

01:03:23.50,01:03:27.00
Just the other night ,  I was sleeping [br] under a bridge ,  and now here I am

01:03:27.50,01:03:30.00
on the grandest ship in the world [br] having champagne with you fine people.

Of course I know it's gone.

01:12:58.50,01:13:00.00
You remind me every day.

01:13:00.50,01:13:06.00
Your father left us nothing but a legacy [br] of bad debts hidden by a good name.

01:13:06.50,01:13:09.00
That name is the only card [br] we have to play.

01:13:09.50,01:13:13.00
I don't understand you. [br] It is a fine match with Hockley.

01:13:13.50,01:13:18.00
- It will ensure our survival. [br] - How can you put this on my shoulders?

01:13:18.50,01:13:19.00


01:13:19.50,01:13:23.00
- Why are you being so selfish? [br] - I'm being selfish?

01:13:23.50,01:13:26.00
 

01:13:26.50,01:13:29.00
Do you want to see me [br] working as a seamstress?

01:13:29.50,01:13:31.00


01:13:31.50,01:13:33.00
Is that what you want?

01:13:33.50,01:13:35.00


01:13:35.50,01:13:39.00
To see our fine things [br] sold at auction?

01:13:39.50,01:13:40.00


01:13:40.50,01:13:42.00
Our memories [br] scattered to the winds?

01:13:42.50,01:13:52.00


01:13:52.50,01:13:55.00
( Sighs) [br] It's so unfair.

01:13:55.50,01:13:56.00


01:13:56.50,01:13:59.00
Of course it's unfair.

01:13:59.50,01:14:01.00
We're women.

01:14:01.50,01:14:03.00


01:14:03.50,01:14:05.00
Our choices are never easy.

01:14:05.50,01:14:12.00


01:14:12.50,01:14:14.00
Hmm?

01:14:14.50,01:14:26.00


01:14:26.50,01:14:31.00
Congregation: [br] ** Protect them by Thy guardian hand **

01:14:37.50,01:14:42.00

01:15:03.50,01:15:06.00
- Hello ,  Mr. Andrews. [br] - Hello ,  Jack.

01:15:06.50,01:15:14.00


01:15:14.50,01:15:18.00
- Sir. [br] - I need to talk to somebody for a sec.

01:15:18.50,01:15:20.00
You're not supposed [br] to be in here.

01:15:20.50,01:15:24.00
** ...fire and foe [br] Protect them... **

01:15:24.50,01:15:26.00
I was just here last night. [br] You don't remember me?

01:15:26.50,01:15:28.00
No ,  I'm afraid I don't. [br] Now you're going to have to turn around.

01:15:28.50,01:15:31.00
He'll tell you. [br] I just-- I just need--

01:15:31.50,01:15:34.00
Mr. Hockley [br] and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater

01:15:34.50,01:15:37.00
continue to be appreciative [br] of your assistance.

01:15:37.50,01:15:41.00
They asked me to ,  uh... [br] give you this in gratitude.

01:15:41.50,01:15:44.00
- I don't want your money. Please ,  l-- [br] - And also to remind you...

01:15:44.50,01:15:46.00
that you hold [br] a third-class ticket

01:15:46.50,01:15:49.00
and that your presence here [br] is no longer appropriate.

01:15:49.50,01:15:51.00
Please ,  I just want [br] to speak to Rose for--

01:15:51.50,01:15:55.00
Gentlemen ,  will you please see that [br] Mr. Dawson gets to where he belongs

01:15:55.50,01:15:57.00
and that he stays there?

01:15:57.50,01:16:00.00
Yes ,  sir. [br] Come along ,  you.

01:16:00.50,01:16:02.00


01:16:02.50,01:16:05.00
** Oh ,  hear us [br] when we cry to Thee **

01:16:05.50,01:16:11.00
** For those in peril [br] on the sea. **

01:16:11.50,01:16:13.00
Ruth: And why Do you have [br] two steering wheels?

01:16:13.50,01:16:15.00
We really only use [br] this near shore.

01:16:15.50,01:16:18.00
Excuse me ,  sir. Another ice warning. [br] This one's from the Noordam.

01:16:18.50,01:16:19.00


01:16:19.50,01:16:21.00
Thank you ,  Sparks.

01:16:21.50,01:16:22.00


01:16:22.50,01:16:26.00
Oh ,  not to worry. [br] Quite normal for this time of year.

01:16:26.50,01:16:28.00
In fact ,  we're speeding up.

01:16:28.50,01:16:31.00
I've just ordered [br] the last boilers lit.

01:16:31.50,01:16:35.00


01:16:35.50,01:16:38.00
Man: Okay ,  son ,  [br] wind it up tight like I showed you.

01:16:38.50,01:16:40.00
Okay ,  now ,  let it go.

01:16:40.50,01:16:43.00


01:16:43.50,01:16:45.00
- Was good ,  wasn't it? [br] - Quite nice.

01:16:45.50,01:16:48.00
That's excellent ,  son.

01:16:48.50,01:16:52.00


01:16:52.50,01:16:55.00
Rose: [br] Mr. Andrews ,  forgive me...

01:16:55.50,01:16:59.00
I did the sum in my head [br] and with the number of lifeboats

01:16:59.50,01:17:01.00
times the capacity you mentioned

01:17:01.50,01:17:05.00
forgive me ,  but it seems that there [br] are not enough for everyone aboard.

01:17:05.50,01:17:08.00
About half ,  actually.

01:17:08.50,01:17:13.00
Rose ,  you miss nothing ,  Do you? [br] In fact ,  I put in these new type davits

01:17:13.50,01:17:15.00
which can take an extra row [br] of boats inside this one

01:17:15.50,01:17:16.00


01:17:16.50,01:17:20.00
but it was thought by some [br] that the deck would look too cluttered

01:17:20.50,01:17:23.00
so I was overruled.

01:17:23.50,01:17:26.00
Waste of deck space as it is [br] on an unsinkable ship.

01:17:26.50,01:17:31.00
Sleep soundly ,  young Rose. I have built [br] you a good ship ,  strong and true.

01:17:31.50,01:17:33.00
She's all the lifeboat you need.

01:17:33.50,01:17:37.00
Just keep heading aft. [br] The next stop will be the engine room.

01:17:37.50,01:17:39.00
Come on.

01:17:39.50,01:17:41.00


01:17:41.50,01:17:46.00
Jack ,  this is impossible. [br] I can't see you.

01:17:46.50,01:17:50.00
- I need to talk to you. [br] - No ,  Jack ,  no.

01:17:50.50,01:17:54.00
Jack ,  I'm engaged.

01:17:54.50,01:17:58.00
I'm marrying Cal. [br] I love Cal.

01:17:58.50,01:18:00.00


01:18:00.50,01:18:04.00
Rose ,  you're no picnic.

01:18:04.50,01:18:07.00
All right ,  you're a spoiled [br] little brat ,  even

01:18:07.50,01:18:11.00
but under that you're the most [br] amazingly astounding

01:18:11.50,01:18:12.00


01:18:12.50,01:18:16.00
wonderful girl-- woman-- [br] that I've ever known and...

01:18:16.50,01:18:18.00
-Jack ,  l... [br] - No ,  let me try and get this out.

01:18:18.50,01:18:22.00
You're , you're ama--

01:18:22.50,01:18:25.00
I'm not an idiot. [br] I know how the world works.

01:18:25.50,01:18:26.00


01:18:26.50,01:18:27.00
I've got ten bucks [br] in my pocket.

01:18:27.50,01:18:28.00


01:18:28.50,01:18:30.00
I have nothing to offer you [br] and I know that.

01:18:30.50,01:18:33.00
I understand.

01:18:33.50,01:18:37.00
But I'm too involved now. [br] You jump ,  I jump ,  remember?

01:18:37.50,01:18:42.00
I can't turn away [br] without knowing you'll be all right.

01:18:42.50,01:18:44.00
That's all that I want.

01:18:44.50,01:18:47.00
Well ,  I'm fine.

01:18:47.50,01:18:50.00
I'll be fine ,  really.

01:18:50.50,01:18:52.00
Really?

01:18:52.50,01:18:54.00


01:18:54.50,01:18:58.00
I don't think so. [br] They've got you trapped ,  Rose

01:18:58.50,01:18:59.00


01:18:59.50,01:19:00.00
and you're going to die [br] if you don't break free--

01:19:00.50,01:19:04.00
Maybe not right away [br] because you're strong ,  but

01:19:04.50,01:19:08.00
sooner or later that fire [br] that I love about you ,  Rose...

01:19:08.50,01:19:10.00
that fire is going to burn out.

01:19:10.50,01:19:15.00


01:19:15.50,01:19:17.00
It's not up to you [br] to save me , Jack.

01:19:17.50,01:19:19.00


01:19:19.50,01:19:24.00
You're right. [br] Only you can do that.

01:19:24.50,01:19:30.00


01:19:30.50,01:19:33.00
I'm going back. [br] Leave me alone.

01:19:33.50,01:19:44.00


01:19:44.50,01:19:48.00
Countess: Tell Lucille about the [br] disaster you had with the stationer's.

01:19:48.50,01:19:51.00
Well ,  of course ,  the invitations [br] had to be sent back twice.

01:19:51.50,01:19:54.00
- Oh ,  my dear! [br] - And the dreadful bridesmaid's gowns--

01:19:54.50,01:19:56.00
Let me tell you what an odyssey [br] that has been.

01:19:56.50,01:20:00.00
Rose decided [br] she wanted lavender.

01:20:00.50,01:20:03.00
She knows I detest the color ,  [br] so she did it only to spite me.

01:20:03.50,01:20:05.00
Lucille: [br] If only you'd come to me sooner.

01:20:05.50,01:20:08.00
Ruth saw some of my designs [br] in "La Mode Illustree."

01:20:08.50,01:20:12.00
They were for Trousseau of the Duchess [br] of Malborough's youngest daughter.

01:20:12.50,01:20:15.00
Theyw ere quite charming ,  but I think [br] you'll agree ,  my dear ,  that together

01:20:15.50,01:20:17.00
we've created something of a phoenix [br] from the ashes.

01:20:17.50,01:20:19.00
( Women Laugh Politely)

01:20:19.50,01:20:33.00


01:20:33.50,01:20:35.00
Hello , Jack.

01:20:35.50,01:20:40.00


01:20:40.50,01:20:42.00
I changed my mind.

01:20:42.50,01:20:47.00


01:20:47.50,01:20:49.00
- They said you might be-- [br] - Shh.

01:20:49.50,01:20:50.00


01:20:50.50,01:20:53.00
Give me your hand.

01:20:53.50,01:21:01.00


01:21:01.50,01:21:03.00
Now close your eyes.

01:21:03.50,01:21:05.00
Go on.

01:21:05.50,01:21:07.00


01:21:07.50,01:21:10.00
Step up.

01:21:10.50,01:21:13.00


01:21:13.50,01:21:15.00
Now hold on to the railing.

01:21:15.50,01:21:18.00
- Keep your eyes closed ,  don't peek. [br] - I'm not.

01:21:18.50,01:21:19.00


01:21:19.50,01:21:22.00
Step up onto the rail.

01:21:22.50,01:21:25.00


01:21:25.50,01:21:29.00
Hold on. Hold on. [br] Keep your eyes closed.

01:21:29.50,01:21:32.00
- ( Giggles) [br] - Do you trust me?

01:21:32.50,01:21:34.00
I trust you.

01:21:34.50,01:21:43.00


01:21:43.50,01:21:47.00
All right ,  open your eyes.

01:21:47.50,01:21:53.00


01:21:53.50,01:21:56.00
I'm flying! Jack!

01:21:56.50,01:22:20.00


01:22:20.50,01:22:24.00
( Softly): [br] ** Come , Josephine ,  my flying machine **

01:22:24.50,01:22:27.00
** Going up ,  she goes **

01:22:27.50,01:22:30.00
** Up ,  she goes... **

01:22:30.50,01:23:17.00


01:23:17.50,01:23:20.00
That was the last time Titanic [br] ever saw daylight.

01:23:20.50,01:23:24.00
So we're up to dusk [br] the night of the sinking.

01:23:24.50,01:23:27.00
- Six hours to go. [br] - Incredible.

01:23:27.50,01:23:29.00
There's Smith and he's standing there [br] and he's got the iceberg warning...

01:23:29.50,01:23:34.00
in his fucking hand-- excuse me-- [br] his hand ,  and he's ordering more speed.

01:23:34.50,01:23:37.00
26years of experience [br] working against him.

01:23:37.50,01:23:39.00
He figures anything big enough [br] to sink the ship

01:23:39.50,01:23:41.00
they're going to see [br] in time to turn

01:23:41.50,01:23:44.00
but the ship's too big [br] with too small a rudder.

01:23:44.50,01:23:47.00
Doesn't corner worth a damn.

01:23:47.50,01:23:50.00
Everything he knows is wrong.

01:23:50.50,01:24:02.00


01:24:02.50,01:24:04.00
( Laughing) [br] It's quite proper ,  I assure you.

01:24:04.50,01:24:08.00
This is the sitting room.

01:24:08.50,01:24:10.00
- Will this light do? [br] - What?

01:24:10.50,01:24:12.00
Don't artists need good light?

01:24:12.50,01:24:14.00
( In French Accent): [br] That is true

01:24:14.50,01:24:17.00
but I'm not used to working [br] in such horrible conditions.

01:24:17.50,01:24:20.00
Monet!

01:24:20.50,01:24:23.00
- Do you know his work? [br] - Of course.

01:24:23.50,01:24:25.00
Look at his use of color here. [br] Isn't he great?

01:24:25.50,01:24:27.00
I know ,  it's extraordinary.

01:24:27.50,01:24:29.00


01:24:29.50,01:24:34.00
Cal insists on carting [br] this hideous thing everywhere.

01:24:34.50,01:24:37.00
Should we be expecting him [br] anytime soon?

01:24:37.50,01:24:41.00
Not as long as the cigars [br] and brandy hold out.

01:24:41.50,01:24:43.00


01:24:43.50,01:24:47.00
- That's nice. [br] - What is it ,  a sapphire?

01:24:47.50,01:24:51.00
A diamond ,  [br] a very rare diamond.

Of course he could. [br] It's easy enough for a professional.
