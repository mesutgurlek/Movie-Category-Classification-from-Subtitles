1
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,192
BROKEN EMBRACES

2
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:49,417
(Newspaper sheets)

3
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:57,483
What's your name?

4
00:01:58,441 --> 00:01:59,733
Harry Caine.

5
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:03,150
(Voiceover) I used to be called Mateo.
and I was a film director.

6
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:07,983
I was always tempted by the idea
of being someone else,

7
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,275
as well as myself.

8
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:13,108
Living one life
wasn't enough for me.

9
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,025
So I invented a pseudonym:

10
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:16,733
Harry Caine,

11
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:21,775
an adventurer who, as fate
would have it, became a writer.

12
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:26,483
I made him sign all
the stories and scripts I wrote.

13
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:30,691
For years,
Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine

14
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,941
shared the same body.

15
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:34,358
Mine.

16
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:37,191
But there came a time when,

17
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:40,941
suddenly, I could only
be Harry Caine.

18
00:02:41,691 --> 00:02:43,650
I became my alter-ego.

19
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,733
a self made writer
created by himself.

20
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,358
There was just one unexpected detail.

21
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:55,358
Harry Caine
would be a blind writer.

22
00:02:57,608 --> 00:02:59,108
Ernesto Martel is dead!

23
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:01,150
Who?

24
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:04,733
Ernesto Martel.
I know his granddaughter.

25
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,858
So he's dead...

26
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:08,816
Yes. Did you know him?

27
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:14,941
What interests you?

28
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:16,900
Politics,

29
00:03:17,608 --> 00:03:19,150
the economy, culture...?

30
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:21,066
I'm interested in you.

31
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,066
What are you like?

32
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:25,816
Can you describe yourself?

33
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:31,358
What do you want to know?

34
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:34,733
Your measurements, for example.

35
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,941
36- 26- 36.

36
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:41,441
What color are your eyes?

37
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:44,275
Green,

38
00:03:44,941 --> 00:03:46,983
With blue highlights in the summer.

39
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:48,983
Your hair?

40
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,441
How are you dressed?

41
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,983
I'm blonde,

42
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:58,650
with long, straight hair.

43
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:03,483
I'm wearing a purple tank top,

44
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,566
tight jeans...

45
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,066
Tight?

46
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,400
Yes, tight.

47
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:12,691
And heels.

48
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:13,900
High heels?

49
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,150
Very high.

50
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:20,858
Let's see...

51
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:25,400
Blonde hair,

52
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:27,775
long.

53
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:30,733
Let's see your eyes...

54
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,691
Green eyes

55
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,941
with blue highlights in the summer.

56
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,858
and your skin...

57
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:40,941
Such beautiful skin.

58
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,858
Lips...

59
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,108
juicy.

60
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:15,333
(pleasure grunts)

61
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,691
May I use the washroom?

62
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:46,274
(Breatheless) 
At the end of the hallway.

63
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:53,792
(Doorbell)

64
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:01,708
(Keys)

65
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:05,233
Sorry, I thought you were alone.

66
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:07,816
Can I come in or
are you having another round?

67
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:10,108
No, no, come in please.
We've finished.

68
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:17,191
She helped me cross the street,
so I invited her in to read me the paper.

69
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:21,399
This place is in shambles.

70
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:26,858
- What are you looking for?
- My shirt.

71
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,149
Here.

72
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:30,649
Your shirt.

73
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,066
Something else?

74
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:34,483
your socks?

75
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,375
Yes, thanks.

76
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,667
There you go.

77
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:40,042
Thanks.

78
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,958
(WC flushing)

79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,333
(Surprised) Hello...

80
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,833
(Unfriendly) Hi.

81
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,108
Well Harry, I'll be off.

82
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:01,608
- Thanks for your help.
- You're welcome.

83
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:04,358
- You're standing on my foot.
- I'm sorry!

84
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:07,816
It was a pleasure.

85
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:09,233
Likewise.

86
00:07:09,858 --> 00:07:11,524
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

87
00:07:13,774 --> 00:07:15,149
Well, I have to go.

88
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:17,358
I hope we meet again.

89
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:30,691
You can't just bring home the first person
who helps you cross the street!

90
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,566
Something might happen to you.

91
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:35,524
Everything has already
happened to me

92
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:38,441
All I can do now is enjoy life.

93
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:44,816
Diego told me that you finished
the script yesterday.

94
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:48,358
Almost, I want to add a final epilogue.

95
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,066
I was supposed to deliver it to the
producer and director today.

96
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:54,816
You'll have it tomorrow,
don't worry.

97
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:57,899
Ernesto Martel is dead.

98
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,483
He was very ill.

99
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,691
It's been a long time
since we last spoke of him.

100
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,274
Yes, that's true.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,083
(doorbell and keys) Hello.

102
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:18,858
You look awful.

103
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,441
Because I was running.

104
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:22,149
It's Monday

105
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:25,774
You don't have to run for my sake, Diego
We're in no rush.

106
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:28,774
I am.
I promised the script.

107
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:31,358
Don't worry you'll have it tonight

108
00:08:31,816 --> 00:08:33,691
Diego, we're changing the ending.

109
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:34,941
Right away?

110
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,774
I've been thinking about the next script.

111
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:42,941
Some fantasy or horror for teens.

112
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,732
That's what sells best.

113
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:47,191
I don't know if I can.

114
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,232
I'd thought about,

115
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:53,482
developing a story based
on Arthur Miller's son.

116
00:08:55,149 --> 00:08:57,482
- The writer who married Marilyn?
- Yes.

117
00:08:57,732 --> 00:09:01,232
It was in Vanity Fair.
I read it in the paper.

118
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:05,107
After Marilyn,
he married the photographer Inge Morath

119
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:06,816
and they had a child.

120
00:09:07,107 --> 00:09:10,357
He was born with Down's syndrome
and Miller hid him away.

121
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:14,191
He didn't even mention him
in his memoirs.

122
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:16,149
and he never wanted to see him.

123
00:09:16,774 --> 00:09:19,482
Despite his wife's pleas,
he would never see the child.

124
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:23,149
That's horrible!

125
00:09:24,232 --> 00:09:26,482
One day,
they met by chance.

126
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:31,066
Miller gave a lecture in defense
of a mental retard,

127
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:35,191
who'd been sentenced to death
after making a forced confession.

128
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:38,982
His son with Down's syndrome
was in the audience.

129
00:09:39,024 --> 00:09:40,357
After the speech,

130
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,857
the son went up to the podium
and embraced his father.

131
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:47,524
Miller didn't know how to
get free of that man,

132
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:51,441
until the stranger let go
and said:

133
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,899
"I am your son Daniel

134
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:56,441
"and I'm very proud of you, dad."

135
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,607
I don't think we can write
about Arthur Miller

136
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,232
Without asking the family
for permission.

137
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:06,691
We can change the names.

138
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,857
It isn't about the
pettiness of the father.

139
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,274
but the strength of the son,
who survives without any grudge

140
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:14,399
towards the parent who ignored
him his whole life.

141
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,607
The subject is interesting.

142
00:10:18,524 --> 00:10:20,732
But years ago

143
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:23,566
when you got back to
writing scripts

144
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:27,899
You told me you would never write
remakes, sequels, or biopics.

145
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:31,107
(Nervous) I remember perfectly, because
I was surprised about biopics.

146
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:31,705
(Doorbell)

147
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:32,316
It isn't a biopic,

148
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:35,607
it's about surpassing oneself
and inate goodness.

149
00:10:36,232 --> 00:10:37,441
Yes, I'll get it.

150
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,441
I brought yogurt

151
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:45,982
but he's out of cleaning
products and juice too

152
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,732
and pick up his dry cleaning.

153
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,191
Hey guys, I'm going.

154
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:56,732
- Talk to you later, Henry
- OK, Judit, OK.

155
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:07,042
(Song: "Vitamin C" By "CAN"
"Communism, Anarchism & Nihilism")

156
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,482
- How's it going?
- Good. You?

157
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:21,899
Good. Do you have the set?

158
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:24,899
Freshly downloaded from eMule!

159
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:26,357
Cool!

160
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,899
Do you want a hit of Crystal?

161
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:35,482
Not tonight. I need to sleep
once in awhile.

162
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:36,941
Cover me.

163
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:39,607
Try to be discreet.

164
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,982
There's no one around!

165
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:50,732
Buy me a drink?

166
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:52,441
Order what you want.

167
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:55,648
- You want something?
- No.

Death of businessman
Ernesto Martel.

175
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:20,274
Obituary: Ernesto Martel,

176
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:23,107
the Chilean-born financier
died yesterday

177
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:24,940
at his residence in Madrid.

178
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:29,149
Living in Spain since childhood, Martel was
one of the leading businessmen of the 90s

179
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:32,482
Ermar Capital, his empire
created in the 80's,

180
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:36,774
financed major infrastructure
projects in latin america.

181
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:38,857
Maried twice,
with two children,

182
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,107
his reputation was tainted
in recent years

183
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:44,190
by his involvment in the
Apresto scandal

184
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:47,274
Accused of fraud and tax evasion
in 2002

185
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:49,982
He was sentenced to
three years in prison.

186
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:53,524
I just spoke with
the Transport Minister

187
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,649
The project is under way.

188
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,774
We will build the subway in Caracas.

189
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,315
For sure, there is a lot of money.

190
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:07,065
For at least five years.

191
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:14,107
I'm looking for a qualified company
and thought of you.

192
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:18,065
Of course.
Everything will go through me.

193
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:20,774
The president told me himself.

194
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:27,458
(Hears his mother calling)

195
00:13:32,732 --> 00:13:34,482
I'll call you later, OK?

196
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:36,667
(internal line)

197
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
Yes Mr. Martel?

198
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,524
Lena...

199
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,232
Can you come into my office?

200
00:13:41,982 --> 00:13:43,899
I want to dictate.

201
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:46,357
Yes sir, right away.

202
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:07,065
It's for the Industry Minister.

203
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,940
"Dear Antonio, I am pleased..."

204
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:12,107
Sorry, I'm sorry.

205
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:13,690
Are you feeling alright?

206
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:17,982
"I am pleased to announce that soon,

207
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,190
"I'll be meeting with a
Venezuelan delegation..."

208
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:22,815
Sorry.

209
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,482
Tell me what's wrong.

210
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,107
I'm sure I can help.

211
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,399
My father is very i'll

212
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,315
He's being discharged this afternoon
and I want to be there.

213
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,857
Of course.
What's wrong with him?

214
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:41,149
Stomach cancer,
and it's metastasized

215
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:44,732
Oh, I'm sorry.

216
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:02,565
Where's Papa?

217
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:04,857
He's waiting inside.

218
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:07,649
I can't believe they left you here,

219
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,232
on the street, like dogs.

220
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:12,857
Wasn't the doctor
operating this week?

221
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,149
He was supposed to.

222
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,482
This morning he told us
they were discharging him.

223
00:15:18,524 --> 00:15:20,482
I asked what that meant.

224
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:23,149
He said: "It's simple,
it's July, I'm going on vacation."

225
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:24,940
What?

226
00:15:24,982 --> 00:15:26,482
I asked: "Are you putting us
on the street?"

227
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:29,232
"No, ma'am.

228
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,649
"I'm sending him home."

229
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,690
"But what can I do with him
at home?"

230
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:38,732
"That's your problem.
I'm going on vacation."

231
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:40,232
"He's dying."

232
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,732
"So, he can die
peacefully at home.'

233
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:48,232
They can't torture him for 20 days
with tests and then do this.

234
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,023
(Whispers) Ladies!

235
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,648
Have you forgotten about me?

236
00:15:52,982 --> 00:15:54,773
What are you saying, dad!

237
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:56,398
No one could forget you.

238
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,815
Sweetheart.

239
00:15:58,898 --> 00:16:00,023
Take it easy.

240
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:02,357
Isn't it nice to get out?

241
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:16,190
I'll put the bags in.

242
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:46,190
You'll be comfortable here.

243
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,148
I'll bring your pills.

244
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:51,107
Try to rest.

245
00:16:57,023 --> 00:16:59,315
I'm leaving now.
I've a lot to do.

246
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,607
Call me if there's anything.

247
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,107
I'll come by in the morning.

248
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,607
Bye, mom.

249
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:12,190
Take care.

250
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:33,815
Madame Mylène? Hi it's Séverine.

251
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:37,607
Severine! It's been so long.
How nice to hear from you.

252
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:39,940
- I need some money.
- When?

253
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:43,732
Now. I'm free on the week-end.
During the week I'm busy.

254
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:47,023
I'll see what I can do.

255
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:50,398
Can I call you tonight?

256
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,773
Of course.
I'll be waiting.

257
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,875
(Phone)

258
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:04,321
Yes?

259
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:05,315
Séverine?

260
00:18:06,523 --> 00:18:07,273
Who's this?

261
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:09,648
I'm calling on behalf of
Madame Mylène.

262
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:13,398
(they recognize their voices) You're mistaken.
There's no Séverine here.

263
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:16,565
I must have the wrong number.
Forgive me.

264
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,898
Your rails, ma'am.

265
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,315
(Phone) Hi, has he called you?

266
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,315
(off) Who?

267
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,148
The client, who else?

268
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:33,107
How dare you give him my number!

269
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:34,523
I couldn't refuse.

270
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,565
That's not how it works!
Are you crazy?

271
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:39,690
He knows all about you.

272
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:42,732
I didn't tell him
he found out by himself.

273
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:45,857
He knows that you
tried your hand at acting,

274
00:18:45,898 --> 00:18:47,398
and at times you've
"performed" for me.

275
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:50,398
Months ago he made me promise

276
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,857
that if you contacted me again
I'd call him.

277
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,732
I couldn't refuse,
he's my best client.

278
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,833
(Hangs)

279
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:05,667
(Phone)

280
00:19:08,608 --> 00:19:09,171
Yes?

281
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:10,315
Oh, Magdalena!

282
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:12,398
Mom, how's dad?

283
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,356
Awful!

284
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:17,231
We had a terrible night.

285
00:19:17,273 --> 00:19:20,148
He's been vomiting blood
and everything.

286
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,106
it's like he'd burst inside.
I don't know what to do.

287
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:25,440
I'm coming.

288
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:34,208
(Phone)

289
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:41,128
Yes?

290
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:42,856
Mr. Martel? It's Lena.

291
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,065
I'm sorry to bother you.

292
00:19:47,106 --> 00:19:48,356
You never bother me.

293
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,398
I'm calling because
my father is dying.

294
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:54,190
He has to be hospitalized,

295
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:56,065
but i don't know where.

296
00:19:56,398 --> 00:20:00,940
They sent him home yesterday
and we don't know what to do.

297
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:02,815
Don't worry.

298
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,690
We'll take him to a private clinic.

299
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:07,773
I'll take care of it.

300
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:12,273
Don't worry, Dr. Blasco is
the best digestive surgeon in Europe.

301
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:13,856
Here.

302
00:20:17,356 --> 00:20:18,815
How's the patient?

303
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:21,981
He arrived in very poor condition.
I think you know that.

304
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:23,481
Can you save him?

305
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,315
I am Ernesto Martel.

306
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:27,023
We'll try our very best.

307
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:30,481
- But right now we can't operate.
- And tomorrow?

308
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:33,773
Perhaps.
We're feeding him intravenously

309
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,356
and he'll need a transfusion
to survive.

310
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:38,731
Do the impossible to save him.

311
00:20:38,773 --> 00:20:41,065
Of course.
That's my duty.

312
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:43,940
I'll keep you informed on the progress

313
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:45,690
Can I stay?

314
00:20:45,731 --> 00:20:49,565
(Surprised) Of course, you can stay
with him as long as you wish.

315
00:20:53,481 --> 00:20:56,190
I can't thank you enough.

316
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:58,815
I'm at your disposal ma'am.

317
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:01,606
Do you want me to stay with you?

318
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,440
No, go on, love,
you've done enough.

319
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:07,148
Should I bring you some food?

320
00:21:08,273 --> 00:21:10,815
No, don't bother
I'll get something later.

321
00:21:11,106 --> 00:21:12,481
I'll call you.

322
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,958
(Whispers) Thanks...

323
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:36,292
(doorbell)

324
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:55,898
Who's there?

325
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,356
It's Ray X.

326
00:21:57,398 --> 00:21:59,898
Ray X?
Nobody's called that.

327
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,523
It's a nickname

328
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:03,565
I used to do lots of ecstasy.

329
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:05,065
What do you want?

330
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:08,481
I want to write a script with you
and direct it myself.

331
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:09,815
You're a director?

332
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:13,231
I made a very good documentary
14 years ago.

333
00:22:13,273 --> 00:22:15,356
This would be my first fiction.

334
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,940
Call my agent Judit Garcìa,
and talk to her

335
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:22,023
She can make an appointment for you

336
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:23,773
I'm going for a shower.

337
00:22:23,815 --> 00:22:25,898
You got me out of the bathroom.

338
00:22:32,023 --> 00:22:34,106
You gonna stay there all day?

339
00:22:34,148 --> 00:22:36,315
You didn't give me
Judit Garcìa's number

340
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,648
Look it up.
She's a well-known production manager.

341
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:40,981
I'm going.

342
00:22:41,731 --> 00:22:43,189
(off) Yes, go on.

343
00:22:54,583 --> 00:23:00,042
(mobile phone)

344
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,792
Yes?

345
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:03,333
Hi, Harry. It is I.

346
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:04,625
Hi, Judit.

347
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:07,856
A young director rang me.
Ray X.

348
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:10,773
He wants to write a script with you.

349
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,398
- You know about it? Yes
- He wants to see you this afternoon.

350
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:14,898
Or tomorrow.

351
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:18,148
I asked for an advance,
and he agreed.

352
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,898
but I can't go with you,
I'm busy with the Americans.

353
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:24,939
OK, I'll see him
and tell you about it.

354
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:27,939
I hope you like him,
he seems to be well-heeled.

355
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:29,439
Have you seen him?

356
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:33,398
No from his voice,
and from the check he's going to sign.

357
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:35,856
I'll send Diego so you're not alone.

358
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:37,398
Ciao

359
00:23:42,773 --> 00:23:44,981
Alicante or Barcelone?

360
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:45,792
Barcelona.

361
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:50,667
The director really wants Barcelona.
I think Alicante it's a better option.

362
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:02,125
(Doorbell)

363
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,542
Hello.

364
00:24:04,606 --> 00:24:07,939
- I'm here to see Harry.
- Yes, he's in his office.

365
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:25,314
Hi, I'm Ray X.

366
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:27,148
How are you?

367
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:29,814
Have a seat.

368
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:43,023
I'm listening

369
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:45,814
I really like your work.

370
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:47,648
I've seen all of it.

371
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:50,148
Thank you very much.

372
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:52,731
Let's get to the point.

373
00:24:53,273 --> 00:24:55,354
What kind of story
do you want to write?

374
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:57,958
(doorbell)

375
00:25:00,939 --> 00:25:03,731
I'd like to write a story about

376
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:07,773
a son's revenge on his
father's memory.

377
00:25:07,814 --> 00:25:09,898
Why does the son want revenge?

378
00:25:12,356 --> 00:25:14,356
The father destroyed him
and ruined his life.

379
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:16,064
How?

380
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:20,398
The father is a violent man,
a homophobe.

381
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:23,231
unscrupulous and very powerful.

382
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:26,773
But the son is a sensitive boy,

383
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:28,439
but he's got lots of complexes
and he's weak.

384
00:25:29,606 --> 00:25:31,939
He always tries to please his father.

385
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:35,481
He's a homosexual but
he got married twice, like his father.

386
00:25:35,856 --> 00:25:37,773
And he separated,
like he did.

387
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:42,481
He's got a son, who hates him
as much as he hated his father.

388
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:44,648
When the father dies.

389
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:47,439
the son can finally rebuild his life.

390
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:50,689
That's his salvation, his revenge.

391
00:25:50,731 --> 00:25:52,481
and the story I want to tell.

392
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:55,731
I fear I'm not the writer
you're looking for.

393
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:57,356
You are!

394
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,023
More than you know.

395
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:01,981
I'll pay whatever you ask.

396
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:03,814
It's too personal.

397
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:06,356
Make it your own.

398
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,606
Thank's, but no.
Now, if you don't mind... Diego!

399
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:16,522
I'll leave you my number.

400
00:26:21,897 --> 00:26:23,647
If you change your mind.

401
00:26:23,939 --> 00:26:26,022
- Come along!
- Leave me alone!

402
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:30,189
I'm sure we'll see each other again.

403
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:32,022
In my case,
that would be a miracle.

404
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,189
- Please, come with me
- I'm coming!

405
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,792
Good bye.

406
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:44,625
(leaves and closes the door)

407
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,356
Son of a bitch!

408
00:26:52,064 --> 00:26:55,064
- He was talking about himself, right?
- I guess.

409
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:57,189
Look in the top drawer.

410
00:26:57,772 --> 00:27:00,564
Look through the photos
of the '94 shoot.

411
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:02,064
He may be in one of them.

412
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:26,356
Keep looking.

413
00:27:44,231 --> 00:27:45,106
Here he is.

414
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:46,897
Describe the photo.

415
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:49,606
He's with you on the shoot.

416
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:53,522
He's got long, straight hair
and he's holding a camera.

417
00:27:53,564 --> 00:27:54,897
I knew it.

418
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,272
Who is he?

419
00:27:57,106 --> 00:27:59,106
Ernesto Martel's son.

420
00:27:59,147 --> 00:28:01,439
What can he want now?

421
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,939
Put the photos away and
close the drawer.

422
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:33,167
(phone)

423
00:28:33,939 --> 00:28:35,564
(Off Ex wife)
Ernesto, it's me.

424
00:28:36,939 --> 00:28:39,439
We have to talk about our son.

425
00:28:39,856 --> 00:28:40,814
Not now, Rosanna

426
00:28:40,856 --> 00:28:43,106
(Off) I caught him trying on my dresses.

427
00:28:43,147 --> 00:28:46,647
It's your fault. You made him
effeminate to humiliate me.

428
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:49,439
(Off) I'm sending him to you.
After all, you're his father.

429
00:28:49,481 --> 00:28:53,772
If I haven't been a good father
for 19 years, I doubt I'll learn now.

430
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:55,606
I have to go.

431
00:28:56,647 --> 00:29:00,147
And tell him if he wants to talk to me
he can call me himself.

432
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:04,939
- Don't be so hard on them.
- Theyr'e blackmailers!

433
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:07,106
- Help me with my necklace
- Of course.

434
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:10,106
Why no invite your son here
for a few days?

435
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:12,314
That's what his mother just said.

436
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:16,814
(whispers) But it's best not
to involve you with them.

437
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,272
He'd keep me company.

438
00:29:19,606 --> 00:29:22,856
- Does he like the cinema or theatre?
- Very much I think.

439
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:26,814
His mother says
he's a bit of a fairy.

440
00:29:27,522 --> 00:29:30,897
If I invite him
I'd like you to tell me if it's true.

441
00:29:31,147 --> 00:29:32,731
and if it can be fixed.

442
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:36,064
- How will I know?
- You don't have to screw him.

443
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:37,314
Oh thanks alot.

444
00:29:37,564 --> 00:29:39,522
But you pretty girls
know those things.

445
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:41,772
Call him, but I won't do that.

446
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:46,104
(Off) This is shameful, Ernesto!

447
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:48,355
What I don't like is
that you're living with a man.

448
00:29:48,397 --> 00:29:49,730
What'll your children think?

449
00:29:49,772 --> 00:29:51,730
That their father is homosexual.

450
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:54,980
He's got good taste
and that hes lucky.

451
00:29:55,939 --> 00:29:58,439
If they love me, they'll accept it.

452
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,980
(Off) You should've told me
before we got married.

453
00:30:01,022 --> 00:30:05,064
If you'd stopped thinking about
my father's fortune you'd have realized.

454
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:05,980
(Off) What do you mean?

455
00:30:06,022 --> 00:30:07,980
I'm hangin up. Pain in the ass!

456
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:09,480
I've got another call.

457
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:15,939
- I hope it's not your other ex-wife?
- I hope not.

458
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:18,147
Never get married, Mario.

459
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:20,480
I'm not planning to right now.

460
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:21,958
(Off) Hello?

461
00:30:22,314 --> 00:30:23,355
It's Judit Garcìa.

462
00:30:23,772 --> 00:30:25,647
Hi, did you get the money?

463
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:28,022
I don't want it.

464
00:30:28,605 --> 00:30:30,855
I'm sending it back.
Ernesto.

465
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,230
Won't you call me Ray?
That's my artistic name.

466
00:30:34,772 --> 00:30:36,230
Artistic?

467
00:30:37,147 --> 00:30:38,230
What are you trying to do?

468
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:39,897
Erase my father's name.

469
00:30:40,647 --> 00:30:42,355
What's that got to do with Harry?

470
00:30:42,772 --> 00:30:44,897
I've wanted to see him for ages.

471
00:30:44,939 --> 00:30:48,439
And it's true I want to make a film
and have him write the script.

472
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,439
I've got the male lead.

473
00:30:52,814 --> 00:30:53,939
You're not a director.

474
00:30:54,272 --> 00:30:57,272
If you saw my documentary
you'd change your mind.

475
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:00,939
Ernesto, forget about us.

476
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,022
Don't be afraid of me.
I'm not my father.

477
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:06,355
Stay away from Harry.

478
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,480
Or else I'll report you for harassment!

479
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:15,355
I really don't want to
scout for locations.

480
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,439
But the Americans are paying
me a fortune and we need it.

481
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,897
Go on,
don't worry about me.

482
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:24,897
Give me Tonino Guerra's book.

483
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:27,689
I'm worried about Harry too.

484
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:29,689
Look after him while I'm away

485
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,147
I'm busy,
I can't spend all day with him.

486
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,730
It's only 2 weeks.

487
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:37,314
Harry's fine on his own.

488
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:40,189
It's because of Ernesto Junior.

489
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:43,064
If he shows up again or calls

490
00:31:43,105 --> 00:31:44,647
let me know right away.

491
00:31:44,689 --> 00:31:46,397
Why are you so worried?

492
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:48,605
He's crazy.
I don't trust him.

493
00:31:48,647 --> 00:31:49,814
Why not?

494
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:52,939
- It's a long story.
- Summarize.

495
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:55,772
This isn't the time.

496
00:31:57,647 --> 00:31:58,855
For you, it never is!

497
00:32:00,105 --> 00:32:03,564
If you really mind looking after Harry,
i'm staying in Madrid.

498
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:04,939
Or hire someone else.

499
00:32:05,772 --> 00:32:09,480
I don't mind keeping him company,
but I'm sick of all the secrets.

500
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:15,564
When's your mother back?

501
00:32:15,855 --> 00:32:18,689
I'm not sure,
in ten days, I think.

502
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:24,814
What are you looking at?

503
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:26,814
A poster that says
"Give blood".

504
00:32:26,855 --> 00:32:28,605
- You want to give yours?
- No, no.

505
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:32,439
I just like the sound of it.

506
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,855
It would be a great film title.

507
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:36,772
It sounds good

508
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:38,772
Like a vampire film.

509
00:32:38,814 --> 00:32:40,230
That's true.

510
00:32:40,439 --> 00:32:43,189
Imagine that behind the ad
there's a group of vampires

511
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,522
who work in various donor clinics
they keep the donated blood

512
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:49,355
and use it themselves.

513
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:52,689
Your mother would like that story.
We'll write it.

514
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:55,625
"Dona Sangre"("Give Blood")

515
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:57,939
The vampires live like the Chinese,

516
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,605
as part of Spanish society
but without attracting attention.

517
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:04,397
and like the Chinese they
also control several industries.

518
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:06,522
Like sunglasses, for example.

519
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:10,438
And late night bars, discos,
after hours clubs.

520
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,730
They don't need drugs to stay awake
so they're the best night workers.

521
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:16,522
And the sun cream business.

522
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:20,522
They're sensitive to climate change
and to holes in the ozone.

523
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:23,480
Their sun creams
are the best on the market.

524
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:24,480
That's good.

525
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:27,522
It must be a thick cream
like armor,

526
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:29,147
to protect them all day

527
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,772
That's how the story begins.

528
00:33:31,813 --> 00:33:34,647
A very beautiful girl,
totally naked.

529
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:37,480
covering her body
with a really thick cream

530
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:40,063
before going to work in a donor clinic.

531
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:43,438
Her body has a beautiful,
velvety pallor.

532
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,647
Great beginning.

533
00:33:46,105 --> 00:33:47,647
We need a love story.

534
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,605
A mixed love story

535
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:53,188
between the young vampire girl
and a normal boy.

536
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,313
She works in one of those
blood donor clinics

537
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:58,063
where they use the blood themselves.

538
00:33:58,105 --> 00:33:59,855
He goes there to give blood.

539
00:33:59,897 --> 00:34:01,688
They instantly like each other.

540
00:34:02,313 --> 00:34:05,938
After she puts the needle in his vein,
she get really aroused.

541
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,522
They start dating,
but she doesn't want him to become a vampire

542
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:12,938
Those vampires don't proselytize.
They don't bite people.

543
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,147
unless it's really necessary.

544
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:17,355
But they like sex right?

545
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:18,730
Sure.

546
00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:23,063
That'll be one of the problems
because we need some tension.

547
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,397
They relaly desire each other

548
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:28,813
but when it comes to screwing,
she holds back.

549
00:34:29,313 --> 00:34:30,355
Why?

550
00:34:30,397 --> 00:34:33,897
In case she loses control and bites
his jugular in the heat of passion

551
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:37,438
She lets him do everything, in front
behind, whatever

552
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
Except kiss her on the mouth.

553
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:40,688
And her breasts?

554
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,188
That's a high risk area.

555
00:34:44,397 --> 00:34:46,063
When he kisses her breasts,

556
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:50,188
She hides her face with the pillow
and she rips it apart with her teeth.

557
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,938
And when she sucks on him?

558
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:55,188
No blowjobs!
She'd tear it off right away

559
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:58,230
Well, a man can do without kisses,

560
00:34:58,272 --> 00:34:59,897
but it's tough when
they won't suck your dick!

561
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:03,105
He's so in love
he accepts it.

562
00:35:03,355 --> 00:35:06,063
When they know each other better,
she'll wear a muzzle

563
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,938
to protect both of them.

564
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,897
When she gets aroused,
she has a kind of dental erection,

565
00:35:11,938 --> 00:35:14,855
and her mouth grows out
like shes a wolf.

566
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,272
I really like your story.

567
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,438
You will sign this one.

568
00:35:22,147 --> 00:35:25,480
I'll be your sparring partner,
like you've always been for me.

569
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:33,855
The music you play
is fucking great!

570
00:35:35,105 --> 00:35:37,438
And I really like you.
Did Alex tell you?

571
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:40,272
I want us to be great friends

572
00:35:40,313 --> 00:35:42,397
and you have to tell me everything.

573
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:43,980
Let me work.

574
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,522
You have to tell me everything.

575
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,938
I need a drink.

576
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:57,272
Sorry, he's high on GHB.

577
00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:59,730
I don't like being touched up.

578
00:36:00,355 --> 00:36:03,230
You want some MDMA?

579
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,313
- Just a bit!
- OK.

580
00:36:07,022 --> 00:36:08,730
I'm working tomorrow.

581
00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:14,730
We're working on a great vampire script.

582
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,542
Are you?

583
00:36:15,792 --> 00:36:20,125
(Plays "Robot Ouef" By "Uffíe")

584
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:35,480
Want some GHB?

585
00:36:36,147 --> 00:36:38,188
I've had some MDMA.

586
00:36:49,605 --> 00:36:51,896
I think your friend likes me.

587
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:53,480
Are you ok, Diego?

588
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:55,271
What is it?

589
00:36:55,521 --> 00:36:57,105
What happened?

590
00:36:57,771 --> 00:36:59,813
- Is that your glass?
- Coke and GHB.

591
00:36:59,855 --> 00:37:02,563
Asshole!
Why did you put it next to his glass!

592
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:06,980
Take it easy.

593
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,271
Get some ice!
Call an ambulance!

594
00:37:13,542 --> 00:37:16,833
(ambulance)

595
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,833
(Diego's mobile rings)

596
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,355
Hello?

597
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:37,428
(Off Harry) Diego?

598
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:40,105
No, I'm a friend of his.
Diego sick.

599
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:42,438
We're taking him to Emergency

600
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,105
(Off Harry) What happened?
Can I speak to him?

601
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:49,896
(Off Harry) Where are you taking him?

602
00:37:49,938 --> 00:37:52,188
- Where are you going?
- Quiròn hospital.

603
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,688
Come on, get in!

604
00:37:57,063 --> 00:37:59,063
He's coming.

605
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:00,896
That's his jacket.

606
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,480
Do you need help?

607
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:33,105
I have to go.

608
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,938
You want the hospital?

609
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,438
- Yes, I do.
- I'll go with you.

610
00:38:36,896 --> 00:38:38,313
I'll hold on to you.

611
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:41,438
- You want Reception?
- Yes.

612
00:39:10,313 --> 00:39:12,021
How do you feel?

613
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:15,063
I don't know... shocked.

614
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:18,146
Did you speak to my mother?

615
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:23,230
- Did you tell her about the coma?
- No! Are you crazy?

616
00:39:23,855 --> 00:39:26,105
Anyway, it was only six hours.

617
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:30,646
If you ever tell her,
say you fainted.

618
00:39:30,896 --> 00:39:32,480
Or whatever.

619
00:39:33,646 --> 00:39:37,355
I told her you ate something
that disagreed with you.

620
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,355
Did she believe you?

621
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:42,230
I don't know.

622
00:39:43,105 --> 00:39:47,313
She wanted to rush back
but I persuaded her not to.

623
00:39:51,146 --> 00:39:52,605
Are you sleeping?

624
00:39:53,605 --> 00:39:55,271
No I'm not sleepy.

625
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:58,355
- You want to talk?
- No.

626
00:40:01,146 --> 00:40:02,688
You want me to talk?

627
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,021
I don't know.
If you want to.

628
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:08,354
I mean to distract you.

629
00:40:09,354 --> 00:40:11,479
Before I went into films.

630
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:14,563
I was very good at telling stories

631
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:20,188
Then will you tell me why my mother
is so afraid of Ernesto Junior?

632
00:40:20,938 --> 00:40:22,438
Is she?

633
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:25,813
She made me promise
I'd keep an eye out.

634
00:40:25,854 --> 00:40:27,646
In case he reappeared.

635
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:31,188
She didn't say why?

636
00:40:32,146 --> 00:40:34,104
She never explains anything.

637
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:38,396
It's a long story.

638
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:40,604
That's what she says

639
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:43,271
How do you know him?

640
00:40:45,146 --> 00:40:47,771
It was 14 years ago,

641
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:53,104
In an office we'd rented
to prepare my latest film.

642
00:40:55,688 --> 00:40:58,521
After writing and directing
five dramas,

643
00:40:58,729 --> 00:41:01,479
I'd finally written a comedy,

644
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:03,188
or so I thought.

645
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:06,771
I wanted to change genres
and take a risk.

646
00:41:07,521 --> 00:41:09,188
And I certainly did.

647
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:11,146
Take a risk, I mean.

648
00:41:15,854 --> 00:41:16,688
Mateo!

649
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:21,354
There's a girl here.
She doesnt have an appointment.

650
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,604
What's she like?

651
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:26,646
Too pretty to be funny.

652
00:41:27,938 --> 00:41:30,854
She's the financier Ernesto Martel's
mistress.

653
00:41:30,896 --> 00:41:32,313
She's here with his son.

654
00:41:32,354 --> 00:41:33,646
Is she an actress?

655
00:41:34,188 --> 00:41:37,021
If she's been with that man
for two years she must be.

656
00:41:37,604 --> 00:41:40,604
But come out and say hello,
just to be polite.

657
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:43,563
You have to be nice to important men.
You never know.

658
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:44,688
OK.

659
00:41:49,438 --> 00:41:50,729
GIRLS AND SUITCASES

660
00:42:08,646 --> 00:42:09,563
Lena.

661
00:42:09,979 --> 00:42:10,979
Mateo.

662
00:42:11,021 --> 00:42:13,479
I'm Ernesto Martel... Junior.

663
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:16,563
I apologize for turning up like this.

664
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:19,396
I heard you were holding auditions for
your next film.

665
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,771
- Yes
- I'd love to audition.

666
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:24,688
I can come another day.

667
00:42:26,688 --> 00:42:29,021
Now that you're here,
we'll read something.

668
00:42:32,604 --> 00:42:34,396
(Whispers) Stay here.

669
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:45,104
(Off Harry) The reading didn't work out.

670
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,271
We were both too nervous.

671
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:52,438
The first meeting
only served to show me

672
00:42:52,896 --> 00:42:56,521
that the mere presence
of that woman disturbed me.

673
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:09,021
Where were you this morning?

674
00:43:09,729 --> 00:43:11,146
Didn't Ernesto tell you?

675
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,896
I didn't ask him.

676
00:43:14,729 --> 00:43:17,063
We went to see a film director.

677
00:43:17,104 --> 00:43:18,229
to do an audition.

678
00:43:18,521 --> 00:43:20,313
An audition? Why?

679
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:22,604
I want to work.

680
00:43:23,438 --> 00:43:25,396
Weren't you going
to redecorate the house?

681
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:27,813
You have to change the furniture,
carpets, lamps...

682
00:43:27,854 --> 00:43:29,104
I don't know how to do that.

683
00:43:29,146 --> 00:43:31,646
Hire a decorator.

684
00:43:31,688 --> 00:43:34,979
Even if I do,
you'll have to guide him.

685
00:43:35,438 --> 00:43:37,271
I want to be an actress.

686
00:43:37,312 --> 00:43:39,062
I always have.

687
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:42,729
You tried before...

688
00:43:43,437 --> 00:43:45,271
and look how you ended up.

689
00:43:46,771 --> 00:43:48,229
That was a low blow.

690
00:43:50,104 --> 00:43:52,187
I'm sorry, my love,
forgive me.

691
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:56,521
I'm going upstairs.

692
00:43:58,312 --> 00:43:59,687
Lena, please.

693
00:44:00,562 --> 00:44:03,396
Don't get angry, darling,
I beg you.

694
00:44:03,437 --> 00:44:06,229
In any case, don't worry.
I was no good.

695
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,021
I was too nervous.

696
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:11,812
(Knocks on the door) (Off)
Telephone. Its Mr. Mateo Blanco.

697
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:14,187
Enter!

698
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:17,729
He says it's important.

699
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:29,292
(listens) Yes? Yes, yes, of course...
Very good, very good, thanks.

700
00:44:33,312 --> 00:44:35,271
It was the director.

701
00:44:35,687 --> 00:44:38,896
The audition wasn't enough,
he wants to see me again.

702
00:44:39,396 --> 00:44:40,562
What are you going to do?

703
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:42,812
Go and see him, no?

704
00:44:44,437 --> 00:44:47,687
I need to do something.
I've always wanted to be an actress.

705
00:44:47,729 --> 00:44:49,562
And what about me?

706
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:52,396
Hi this is Magdalena Rivero.

707
00:44:52,437 --> 00:44:55,396
I want to cancel my massage tomorrow.

708
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:58,312
I'll call you another time.
Thank you.

709
00:44:59,437 --> 00:45:01,021
They still haven't given me the part.

710
00:45:01,062 --> 00:45:02,396
They will.

711
00:45:02,646 --> 00:45:04,854
If they do, it wont change a thing.

712
00:45:04,896 --> 00:45:07,562
except that I'll be working too,
like you.

713
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,812
And at night we'll tell each other
what we've done.

714
00:45:12,146 --> 00:45:13,771
Why don't we get married?

715
00:45:15,271 --> 00:45:17,521
I'm asking you to marry me.

716
00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:20,854
Haven't you got married
and divorced enough times?

717
00:45:20,896 --> 00:45:23,354
With you, it would be the first time.

718
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:27,604
We've been living together for two years.

719
00:45:27,937 --> 00:45:29,854
We're fine like this.

720
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:31,521
Don't you think?

721
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:34,896
It seems you don't

722
00:45:36,062 --> 00:45:38,854
(Off Harry) Ernesto Martel offered to
produce the film.

723
00:45:38,896 --> 00:45:40,479
You mother didn't want that.

724
00:45:40,687 --> 00:45:42,854
We were waiting for a grant from
the Minstry...

725
00:45:42,896 --> 00:45:46,104
- You want help?
- No, I'll show you.

726
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:48,271
...and a television pre-sale

727
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,229
But that would take months.

728
00:45:51,521 --> 00:45:53,979
And I was in a real hurry
to start shooting.

729
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:56,687
Just like Audrey!
Spot on, faggot!

730
00:45:56,729 --> 00:45:58,396
(Portuguese accent) Totally Audrey!

731
00:45:58,437 --> 00:45:59,562
Divine!

732
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:02,271
Move closer to the mirror.

733
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:09,729
Light up your face.

734
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:11,771
Now look at me in profile.

735
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:15,062
with an exaggerated smile,
like the model.

736
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:17,187
Like that one?

737
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:20,312
Yes. Come on.

738
00:46:21,354 --> 00:46:24,354
Open your eyes more
and close your mouth a bit.

739
00:46:24,396 --> 00:46:25,896
Come on. Now.

740
00:46:29,729 --> 00:46:30,854
Very good. Again.

741
00:46:31,687 --> 00:46:33,771
Open your mouth a little more.
Now.

742
00:46:34,729 --> 00:46:35,937
Wonderful.

743
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:37,771
Again.

744
00:46:39,646 --> 00:46:41,187
- Art!
- Totally!

745
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:46,021
Now i'd like to try something
much more daring.

746
00:46:46,062 --> 00:46:48,937
A platinum blonde wig.
Something very pop.

747
00:46:48,979 --> 00:46:50,021
I've got one.

748
00:46:50,771 --> 00:46:53,562
I've got a Goldie Hawn type,
with much more volume.

749
00:46:53,604 --> 00:46:55,229
That'll look fabulous.

750
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,187
- But she mustn't look like a poodle.
- No?

751
00:46:58,229 --> 00:47:01,062
If she isn't a poodle
she isn't Goldie.

752
00:47:01,104 --> 00:47:04,354
I told you he wouldn't like Goldie, faggot!

753
00:47:04,396 --> 00:47:06,312
He wears it when he gets dressed.

754
00:47:06,937 --> 00:47:08,812
- So, platinum blonde.
- Yes.

755
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:10,770
I'll change your make up.

756
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:13,270
Get out of the way!

757
00:47:13,645 --> 00:47:15,312
Look, the wig's false,
it's really bad.

758
00:47:15,562 --> 00:47:19,229
It's Kanecalon fiber,
but it looks fabulous.

759
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,854
OK, let's have a look.

760
00:47:21,812 --> 00:47:23,145
You'll flip out.

761
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:29,520
Put these on.

762
00:47:42,645 --> 00:47:44,562
Judit, can you move to your left?

763
00:47:56,937 --> 00:47:57,854
Are you tired?

764
00:48:02,687 --> 00:48:05,937
Don't smile,
The wig is false enough.

765
00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:09,062
That's it.
Wonderful.

766
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,104
(Off Mateo) From the start,
Judit didn't like Lena.

767
00:48:13,187 --> 00:48:15,937
But I like her more every day.

768
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:19,812
And Ernesto Junior liked me.

769
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:22,104
and I intended to use that.

770
00:48:22,979 --> 00:48:26,437
His father had asked him to make a
documentary about the shoot.

771
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,729
As for Ernesto Sr.

772
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:34,562
I'd never met a man
so obsessed by a woman.

773
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:38,645
He was producing the film
in a desperate attempt not to lose Lena.

774
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,355
(far away voices, cutting off)

775
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,729
This is shit!
It's incomprehensible!

776
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:46,042
(shouting) Action!

777
00:48:46,104 --> 00:48:48,812
(Off Mateo) In the midst of that
emotional panorama,

778
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,854
we started shooting.

779
00:48:55,437 --> 00:48:58,854
Now think of all the times
you've made gazpacho for Iván.

780
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,854
How he enjoyed it.

781
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,437
And that breaks your heart.

782
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,479
We'll do the first time you come
home after a photo session.

783
00:49:31,812 --> 00:49:35,187
As soon as you open the door,
you look over at the answering machine.

784
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,187
If it's flashing, it may be Ivan.

785
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,729
"If it isn't flashing,
it'll be another day of despair

786
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:43,812
because you've been
looking for him for two days.

787
00:49:43,854 --> 00:49:45,729
All right. OK, OK.

788
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,687
Listen, did you like the
bit with the tomatoes?

789
00:49:48,979 --> 00:49:49,729
Yes a lot.

790
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:51,229
It moved me.

791
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:53,687
Me too,
It really moved me.

792
00:49:53,729 --> 00:49:57,145
It's amazing that you could
be moved by tomatoes.

793
00:49:57,187 --> 00:49:58,645
It wasn't the tomatoes

794
00:49:58,687 --> 00:50:01,437
it was the nice things
you were saying to me."

795
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:05,145
They like each other?

796
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:09,812
Do you think they like each other?

797
00:50:10,312 --> 00:50:11,229
Me?

798
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,895
I don't know anything.

799
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,437
I only look at their lips.

800
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:18,520
Samples?

801
00:50:19,187 --> 00:50:20,062
What do you think?

802
00:50:26,895 --> 00:50:27,770
Cut!

803
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:29,437
Very good. Print it.

804
00:50:33,729 --> 00:50:36,270
- Are you going to do anything?
- No, you can go.

805
00:50:36,312 --> 00:50:38,062
I don't mind staying.

806
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:41,103
You should go.
I'm going to check some wigs.

807
00:50:41,145 --> 00:50:43,020
Wigs? I love that!

808
00:50:43,062 --> 00:50:47,020
Enough! You've filmed hours of wigs.
This is more of the same.

809
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:48,228
And Lena?

810
00:50:51,312 --> 00:50:54,937
After we've tried the new wigs
she wants a massage.

811
00:50:54,978 --> 00:50:56,187
She's got a contraction.

812
00:50:56,228 --> 00:50:59,020
I haven't got any contractions.

813
00:50:59,062 --> 00:51:00,062
Couldn't I film it?

814
00:51:00,103 --> 00:51:02,937
Ernesto, please,
don't be such a pain. Go home!

815
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:04,812
Bye.

816
00:51:10,395 --> 00:51:11,353
Edurne...

817
00:51:12,187 --> 00:51:15,187
I'm going to speak to Lena.
I don't want to be interrupted.

818
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:17,687
Don't worry, I'll see to it.

819
00:51:18,062 --> 00:51:19,728
I'll be your watchdog.

820
00:51:39,978 --> 00:51:42,020
Wait.
Is his son out there?

821
00:51:42,062 --> 00:51:46,353
No, I sent him home.
Edurne's keeping watch.

822
00:51:51,228 --> 00:51:53,228
Mateo, this is crazy.

823
00:51:54,083 --> 00:52:03,500
(pleasure grunts)

824
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,750
Hello.

825
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:52,042
Hello.

826
00:52:52,145 --> 00:52:53,603
What are you doing?

827
00:52:54,062 --> 00:52:54,978
Nothing.

828
00:52:56,103 --> 00:52:57,395
Waiting for you.

829
00:52:57,437 --> 00:53:00,103
I didn't think filmmaking was
such hard work.

830
00:53:01,562 --> 00:53:02,603
Yes. It doesn't stop.

831
00:53:03,145 --> 00:53:04,978
It's very absorbing.

832
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,562
Aren't you tired?

833
00:53:07,562 --> 00:53:09,478
Chocolate gives me energy.

834
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,437
I love bitter orange with chocolate.

835
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,228
I meant the shoot, not the chocolate.

836
00:53:16,853 --> 00:53:19,353
Oh, very.
At the end of the week, I'm exhausted.

837
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:21,270
But I'm happy.

838
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:24,062
I thought we could take a break.

839
00:53:24,103 --> 00:53:26,728
A weekend, just you and I.

840
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,812
in the house on Ibiza.

841
00:53:29,978 --> 00:53:32,145
We rehearse on weekends.

842
00:53:32,812 --> 00:53:35,687
Don't you rehearse during the shoot?

843
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:38,645
Do you spend
the whole day rehearsing?

844
00:53:38,978 --> 00:53:40,603
That's how films are made!

845
00:53:40,895 --> 00:53:44,395
What about our life?
You can't just set it aside for months.

846
00:53:44,812 --> 00:53:46,895
The film sets the rules.

847
00:53:48,062 --> 00:53:51,020
No, I set them.
I'm the producer.

848
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:55,062
- Is there a problem?
- Yes.

849
00:53:55,353 --> 00:53:57,270
It's completely impersonal.

850
00:53:57,562 --> 00:54:01,228
I asked for a graphic set
but this is totally dead!

851
00:54:01,478 --> 00:54:02,895
Shall I speak to Antxon?

852
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,812
No, I'll do it.

853
00:54:05,395 --> 00:54:06,686
What's wrong with you?

854
00:54:06,978 --> 00:54:08,186
You look awful.

855
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:09,936
Its Diego.

856
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,395
He could hardly breathe all night.
Neither of us got any sleep.

857
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,520
You still don't know what it is?

858
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,686
Some doctors say it's asthma,
others that he's allergic.

859
00:54:19,978 --> 00:54:21,603
but we don't know to what.

860
00:54:22,186 --> 00:54:24,561
They're still investigating,

861
00:54:24,853 --> 00:54:26,395
but we're desperate.

862
00:54:26,686 --> 00:54:28,645
Take all the time that you need.

863
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:31,645
Right now,
your son is what matters.

864
00:54:35,478 --> 00:54:36,311
Another thing,

865
00:54:36,603 --> 00:54:38,686
- I was talking to the producer.
- And?

866
00:54:39,686 --> 00:54:42,270
He's complaining that Lena's
too absorbed by the shooting.

867
00:54:44,478 --> 00:54:47,020
How does he think films are made?

868
00:54:47,561 --> 00:54:50,645
Ernesto is a business man,
not an artist.

869
00:54:50,686 --> 00:54:53,020
No one asked him
to become a producer!

870
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:55,770
It's too late to argue about that.

871
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:03,186
He's taking her to Ibiza this weekend.
So you cannot rehearse.

872
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:06,520
Son of a bitch.

873
00:55:08,811 --> 00:55:12,228
(Off Harry) Get rid of the table,
lamps and chairs!

874
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,770
I wanted a graphic set
but it should be alive.

875
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:30,958
(grunts and groans)

876
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:44,583
(Deep breathe)

877
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:28,667
(Deep breathe)

878
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:52,125
(Groan)

879
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:11,311
God I look terrible!

880
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,292
(SCREAM)

881
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,894
You are scared when I touch you

882
00:58:03,186 --> 00:58:05,686
but not when you see me dead?

883
00:58:06,811 --> 00:58:08,811
I didn't think you were dead.

884
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:11,228
I thought you were sleeping.

885
00:58:12,103 --> 00:58:13,769
I usually snore.

886
00:58:15,269 --> 00:58:18,603
If I'd thought you were dead
I wouldn't have got made up for you.

887
00:58:19,686 --> 00:58:23,478
Any man of my age could have a heart attack
after screwing six times.

888
00:58:25,894 --> 00:58:27,728
You're not a man of your age.

889
00:58:32,978 --> 00:58:34,644
I wouldn't mind dying

890
00:58:34,936 --> 00:58:38,186
after fucking you for days,
weeks, months,

891
00:58:38,478 --> 00:58:39,978
years, centuries.

892
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:43,561
I'm crazy about you,

893
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,603
you drive me crazy.

894
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:48,144
I guess you know that.

895
00:58:49,144 --> 00:58:52,269
Yes.
I think I do.

896
00:58:53,042 --> 00:58:56,000
(Shouting) Action!

897
00:58:56,728 --> 00:58:59,978
Look at what I found on the sidewalk.
They fell off your terrace.

898
00:59:00,019 --> 00:59:02,061
(Serious, not acting) They were gifts
from Ivan, I threw them out.

899
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:04,686
You can't do that, Miss Pina.

900
00:59:05,228 --> 00:59:07,019
You could kill someone.

901
00:59:07,061 --> 00:59:10,436
In Naples, on New Year's Eve,
they even throw out furniture.

902
00:59:10,978 --> 00:59:14,144
My grandpa was Neapolitan
and it's in my blood.

903
00:59:14,186 --> 00:59:17,061
But this isn't Naples
and today isn't New Year's Eve.

904
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:22,186
I was nervous, throwing them out
relaxes me. You keep them.

905
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:24,353
They'll come in handy.

906
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:26,603
"Love... '

907
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:30,603
You say "love", I say "sex"!

908
00:59:31,103 --> 00:59:31,978
Cut!

909
00:59:32,728 --> 00:59:34,769
- Shall we print it?
- Like hell!

910
00:59:35,853 --> 00:59:37,603
I'll fix your make up after, OK?

911
00:59:44,603 --> 00:59:46,019
You're not on form today.

912
00:59:46,978 --> 00:59:47,894
I know.

913
00:59:48,769 --> 00:59:50,103
What's wrong?

914
00:59:50,144 --> 00:59:51,769
(Crying) I'll tell you later.

915
00:59:53,519 --> 00:59:55,519
- Take a sandwich break.
- 30 minutes?

916
00:59:56,811 --> 00:59:58,561
We'll take a 30 minute sandwich break!

917
00:59:59,019 --> 01:00:01,311
Let's clear this a bit and go outside.

918
01:00:16,603 --> 01:00:17,644
(Off lip reader) No lips.

919
01:00:20,978 --> 01:00:23,394
I've had a horrible weekend.

920
01:00:23,894 --> 01:00:26,894
But we didn't rehearse
so that you could rest.

921
01:00:27,228 --> 01:00:28,269
Rest?

922
01:00:28,561 --> 01:00:32,061
I had that son of a bitch
on top of me for 48 hours.

923
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:35,894
He didn't let up for a second.
The bastard.

924
01:00:36,644 --> 01:00:38,853
I'm living on tranquilizers

925
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:40,686
No lips.

926
01:00:45,269 --> 01:00:47,144
No, no.
I'll get over it and I'll do it.

927
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:49,186
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

928
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:52,769
You have to be witty
and light.

929
01:00:54,269 --> 01:00:55,186
Of course.

930
01:00:55,936 --> 01:00:56,894
Light...

931
01:01:01,478 --> 01:01:04,436
You don't know what it's like
having that monster on top of you

932
01:01:04,478 --> 01:01:06,311
for 48 hours.

933
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:07,894
It makes me sick.

934
01:01:09,811 --> 01:01:11,561
It's best
if you don't think about it.

935
01:01:12,019 --> 01:01:14,644
It's best if you and I
never talk about Ernesto.

936
01:01:15,102 --> 01:01:15,936
It's best not to

937
01:01:16,394 --> 01:01:18,061
open that can of worms.

938
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:23,519
What do you do with your notebooks?

939
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:25,894
I fill them.

940
01:01:26,269 --> 01:01:27,227
And then?

941
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:28,352
I burn them.

942
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:30,894
I'd rather the notebooks slept here.

943
01:01:32,311 --> 01:01:33,102
Slept?

944
01:01:33,561 --> 01:01:36,394
Leave them here,
you'll get them back tomorrow.

945
01:01:37,977 --> 01:01:39,519
When you finish,
I'll keep them.

946
01:01:40,061 --> 01:01:41,769
Very well.
Whatever you say.

947
01:01:45,561 --> 01:01:49,102
- What time tomorrow?
- I'll call you when the material is ready.

948
01:01:50,144 --> 01:01:53,561
I presume you are aware of the total
confidentiality of your work.

949
01:01:54,061 --> 01:01:55,102
Of course.

950
01:02:17,644 --> 01:02:21,311
My father was asking why
I don't go with you to yoga.

951
01:02:21,769 --> 01:02:25,811
Tell him that I'm grown up, and free,
and that I've forbidden you to follow me.

952
01:02:26,269 --> 01:02:27,727
I can't tell him that.

953
01:02:27,769 --> 01:02:29,936
Try it.
It would do you good.

954
01:02:29,977 --> 01:02:31,144
I can't.

955
01:02:31,602 --> 01:02:34,061
Do what you like,
but don't come with me.

956
01:02:34,102 --> 01:02:35,936
You're such a pain!

957
01:03:32,561 --> 01:03:33,936
What are you doing?

958
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:35,977
Working.

959
01:03:37,144 --> 01:03:38,061
Turn that off!

960
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:40,894
Didn't Mateo
forbid you to tape us off the shoot?

961
01:03:41,227 --> 01:03:43,936
My father told me to ignore that,
he wants to see everything.

962
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:47,019
Neither of you has any scruples!

963
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:48,852
Fucking leave me alone!

964
01:03:49,477 --> 01:03:50,852
Remember I'm taping you.

965
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:53,894
Stop, I said.

966
01:03:54,894 --> 01:03:55,727
Stop!

967
01:03:57,477 --> 01:03:59,269
I told you to stop!
Give me the fucking camera!

968
01:03:59,894 --> 01:04:00,727
You're crazy!

969
01:04:01,352 --> 01:04:03,644
- Give it to me!
- Let go! My camera!

970
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:26,542
(Door slamming)

971
01:04:27,186 --> 01:04:28,561
Focus on me.

972
01:04:37,769 --> 01:04:39,185
Listen carefully.

973
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,560
Yes, I'm talking to you.

974
01:04:42,894 --> 01:04:44,352
I've just been with the man I love.

975
01:04:45,685 --> 01:04:48,060
and I'm happier than I've ever been

976
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,852
beacuse that man loves me too,
a lot.

977
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:56,519
Don't worry,
I'll leave you in peace very soon.

978
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,144
You needn't spy on us anymore.

979
01:05:01,227 --> 01:05:02,894
There's nothing to hide now.

980
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:14,167
(door slam)

981
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:38,083
(steps getting closer)

982
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:48,625
(steps walking away)

983
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:04,917
(wood cracks)

984
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:20,250
(ice clings)

985
01:06:28,727 --> 01:06:31,560
I don't know if you got back a
little late or early.

986
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,852
It was raining, we couldn't shoot.

987
01:06:34,352 --> 01:06:35,477
Where are you going?

988
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:38,477
I am leaving you.

989
01:06:39,477 --> 01:06:40,644
Shouldn't we talk first?

990
01:06:40,977 --> 01:06:42,769
I've said all I had to say to you.

991
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,560
Lena, please!

992
01:06:46,352 --> 01:06:47,185
Goodbye.

993
01:06:48,602 --> 01:06:49,727
Listen to me.

994
01:06:50,102 --> 01:06:50,894
Let go.

995
01:07:16,042 --> 01:07:22,583
(grunts)

996
01:07:30,394 --> 01:07:32,852
Turn over, my love.
I'll help you.

997
01:07:33,894 --> 01:07:34,977
Let me do it.

998
01:07:36,477 --> 01:07:38,769
Relax, I'll help you.

999
01:07:40,685 --> 01:07:42,269
You could have broken something.

1000
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:44,144
I'll take off your shoes.

1001
01:07:48,769 --> 01:07:50,394
You'll be more comfortable.

1002
01:07:52,227 --> 01:07:54,394
I'll see to everything.
Come on!

1003
01:07:56,185 --> 01:07:57,060
Help me.

1004
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,643
Sit down, but be careful.

1005
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,018
My darling.

1006
01:08:32,352 --> 01:08:33,560
That's it.

1007
01:08:34,018 --> 01:08:35,727
I'll take you to the hospital.

1008
01:09:11,768 --> 01:09:15,143
My wife fell down the stairs.
Be careful.

1009
01:09:19,393 --> 01:09:20,643
Watch her head.

1010
01:09:25,018 --> 01:09:25,893
Easy does it.

1011
01:09:26,643 --> 01:09:28,518
Be careful with my legs.

1012
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,893
Take her to trauma.

1013
01:10:15,893 --> 01:10:18,893
- Can I used the phone?
- Not in here, in the Doctor's office.

1014
01:10:19,268 --> 01:10:20,143
It's urgent.

1015
01:10:20,185 --> 01:10:22,560
We'll take you there right away.

1016
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:29,643
What's wrong?
Aren't you coming?

1017
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,268
No, not tonight.

1018
01:10:31,893 --> 01:10:33,560
Has something happened?

1019
01:10:35,018 --> 01:10:36,435
Something came up unexpectedly.

1020
01:10:37,018 --> 01:10:39,143
but don't worry,
everything's fine.

1021
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:42,268
Tomorrow is an evening shoot.
Will I see you before?

1022
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:44,643
No, I can't make it.

1023
01:10:45,393 --> 01:10:48,018
I've got a lot to do.
I'll see you at the studio.

1024
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:49,518
You sound odd.

1025
01:10:50,518 --> 01:10:51,768
There's really nothing wrong?

1026
01:10:54,435 --> 01:10:56,018
I'll see you tomorrow.

1027
01:11:00,268 --> 01:11:02,935
(Off) There they are.
Ask no questions.

1028
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:14,060
- How are you ma'am?
- Fine.

1029
01:11:14,518 --> 01:11:15,768
Can I help you?

1030
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,393
No, I'm all right,
thank you.

1031
01:11:17,893 --> 01:11:19,393
It was nothing.

1032
01:11:19,435 --> 01:11:22,435
Martìn, go on ahead and
open the door.

1033
01:11:32,185 --> 01:11:34,310
Thank you for your discretion.

1034
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:40,060
Can you take off your glasses, please?

1035
01:11:50,518 --> 01:11:52,268
What can i do...

1036
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:54,393
so that you'll forgive me?

1037
01:11:55,018 --> 01:11:56,518
Take me to the studio.

1038
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,810
You shouldn't move.

1039
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,768
If you don't, I'll drag
myself there if I have to.

1040
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:02,268
What'll you say?

1041
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:05,643
How will you explain the
cast and the bruises?

1042
01:12:06,185 --> 01:12:07,393
It depends on you.

1043
01:12:13,268 --> 01:12:16,768
I'll do what you want
if you promise to stay with me.

1044
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:21,560
I'll stay with you.

1045
01:12:22,435 --> 01:12:26,393
if you let Mateo finish the film
however he wishes.

1046
01:12:26,435 --> 01:12:28,893
He'll interrogate you,
he isn't stupid.

1047
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:31,018
I'll say I tripped.

1048
01:12:33,268 --> 01:12:34,935
How can you work
if you can't walk?

1049
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:36,935
He'll decide that.

1050
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:40,185
but I want to be sure
you'll respect his decision.

1051
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,268
no matter what it costs
or the time it takes.

1052
01:12:44,143 --> 01:12:44,935
Is that clear?

1053
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,268
I live there.

1054
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,143
That's everything.

1055
01:13:19,518 --> 01:13:21,685
Ernesto will back
whatever you decide.

1056
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:23,018
Decide what?

1057
01:13:23,393 --> 01:13:26,518
I can't go from a shot of you
walking normally to one in a cast.

1058
01:13:28,643 --> 01:13:30,393
When can you take it off?

1059
01:13:30,768 --> 01:13:31,643
In 3 weeks.

1060
01:13:33,685 --> 01:13:35,768
May I speak to Lena alone?

1061
01:13:53,893 --> 01:13:55,268
Tell me the truth.

1062
01:13:56,643 --> 01:13:58,518
People don't fall down stairs.

1063
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,685
That only happens in films.

1064
01:14:01,018 --> 01:14:02,393
(whispers) Keep your voice down.

1065
01:14:03,143 --> 01:14:06,768
We have to finish shooting as soon as we can.
Until then, I can't leave Ernesto.

1066
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,143
Why?
He's a psychopath.

1067
01:14:09,643 --> 01:14:11,310
What more proof do you need?

1068
01:14:25,518 --> 01:14:26,768
I can't leave.

1069
01:14:27,018 --> 01:14:30,143
I promised to stay with him
if he lets you finish the film

1070
01:14:30,393 --> 01:14:32,685
under your conditions.

1071
01:14:34,768 --> 01:14:37,060
There must be a better solution.

1072
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:38,143
Whatis it?

1073
01:14:38,643 --> 01:14:41,643
The only solution is that I
stay with him until it's finished.

1074
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,685
What have you promised exactly?

1075
01:14:44,018 --> 01:14:45,810
To live under the same roof

1076
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,435
in separate bedrooms.

1077
01:14:48,768 --> 01:14:50,143
He's got no rights.

1078
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:52,518
Do you think he'll accept that?

1079
01:14:53,435 --> 01:14:54,768
I don't know!

1080
01:14:55,018 --> 01:14:57,643
But the sooner we finish the better.

1081
01:14:57,893 --> 01:14:59,560
We mustn't stop now.

1082
01:15:04,059 --> 01:15:06,143
We just have one scene on the stairs.

1083
01:15:08,143 --> 01:15:10,018
We'd have to repeat the ending.

1084
01:15:11,768 --> 01:15:14,143
Retake 23. One, first.

1085
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,833
(shouts) Action!

1086
01:15:23,809 --> 01:15:26,018
So you're Ivan's ex-wife?

1087
01:15:26,309 --> 01:15:29,393
the one who's been
in a mental hospital for 20 years.

1088
01:15:32,143 --> 01:15:34,768
Yes, but I'm not
in a mental hospital now.

1089
01:15:35,434 --> 01:15:37,018
I'm here with you.

1090
01:15:37,893 --> 01:15:39,643
On top of the stairs.

1091
01:15:40,518 --> 01:15:43,143
From the note, it seems
You're anxious to see him.

1092
01:15:44,143 --> 01:15:45,893
Yes, but you go first.

1093
01:15:46,893 --> 01:15:48,559
You're the one in a hurry.

1094
01:15:48,893 --> 01:15:51,143
I've been waiting 20 years.

1095
01:15:52,393 --> 01:15:53,309
Go on.

1096
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,059
As I was saying,

1097
01:16:06,768 --> 01:16:10,934
after I split up with my husband
I went out on the street.

1098
01:16:11,268 --> 01:16:12,559
and there was a guy eyeing me,
good looking,

1099
01:16:12,893 --> 01:16:15,393
his ass...
his feet...

1100
01:16:16,059 --> 01:16:18,559
I brought him home
and screwed him several times.

1101
01:16:18,934 --> 01:16:22,143
I'm very interested in sex
as a social matter.

1102
01:16:22,893 --> 01:16:24,143
- How was it?
- In bed?

1103
01:16:24,184 --> 01:16:26,684
Divine! A virtuoso!
I've never seen anything like it.

1104
01:16:26,726 --> 01:16:27,809
Incredible.

1105
01:16:28,143 --> 01:16:29,018
This is the good take.

1106
01:16:29,268 --> 01:16:31,059
His big toe!

1107
01:16:33,309 --> 01:16:36,018
(Off Mateo) Every morning,
Lena arrived at the shoot exhausted.

1108
01:16:37,143 --> 01:16:38,684
By sheer repetition,

1109
01:16:39,018 --> 01:16:42,309
there was always a take
in which she managed to do it well.

1110
01:16:43,018 --> 01:16:46,143
Living with Martel
had become hell.

1111
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,643
Lena didn't say anything
but it was obvious.

1112
01:16:50,143 --> 01:16:52,893
When shooting finished
I begged her to leave him.

1113
01:16:53,143 --> 01:16:55,518
but she was scared for the film.

1114
01:16:56,143 --> 01:17:00,309
She didn't want to leave him until
I'd chosen all the good takes.

1115
01:17:01,167 --> 01:17:02,583
(Phone)

1116
01:17:03,512 --> 01:17:04,074
(Off) Hello?

1117
01:17:04,174 --> 01:17:05,184
(Off) It's Magdalena.

1118
01:17:05,559 --> 01:17:06,684
(Off) Is something wrong?

1119
01:17:06,726 --> 01:17:09,809
(Off) No, I'm down below.
I've got no money for the taxi.

1120
01:17:09,851 --> 01:17:11,518
I'm coming down.

1121
01:17:12,809 --> 01:17:13,643
I'll be right back.

1122
01:17:33,934 --> 01:17:35,268
She's in the washroom.

1123
01:17:44,643 --> 01:17:46,309
What's happened?

1124
01:17:48,684 --> 01:17:50,643
We had a terrible fight.

1125
01:17:51,309 --> 01:17:55,268
He tore off my clothes
and threw me out on the street.

1126
01:17:56,143 --> 01:17:59,184
Give the taxi driver a tip.

1127
01:17:59,518 --> 01:18:01,018
He lent me his jacket, otherwise...

1128
01:18:01,893 --> 01:18:03,184
Son of a bitch!

1129
01:18:03,643 --> 01:18:05,684
We'll report him
to the police right now.

1130
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:10,643
Take me far away from here, please.

1131
01:18:13,059 --> 01:18:14,268
Yes, of course.
Whatever you want.

1132
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:36,958
("Werewolf" by Cat Power)

1133
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,392
Give me the camera!

1134
01:19:35,767 --> 01:19:37,017
What are you writing?

1135
01:19:39,017 --> 01:19:40,892
"The secret of Golfo Beach."

1136
01:19:42,267 --> 01:19:44,892
When I took the photo
I didn't see the couple kissing.

1137
01:19:46,267 --> 01:19:47,767
And what's the secret?

1138
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:49,392
I don't know.

1139
01:19:50,267 --> 01:19:52,392
I have to write it to find out.

1140
01:19:56,017 --> 01:19:57,559
We're that couple.

1141
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:09,517
(Off TV) What is it?

1142
01:20:11,642 --> 01:20:13,309
(Off TV) It looks like a leg.

1143
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:17,142
(Off TV) It's an arm.

1144
01:20:18,809 --> 01:20:20,517
(Off TV) and two other legs.

1145
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,309
(Off TV) Two people, just like when they died.

1146
01:20:25,642 --> 01:20:27,392
(Off TV) A man and a woman.

1147
01:20:28,517 --> 01:20:30,767
(Off TV) They died together.

1148
01:20:35,392 --> 01:20:36,809
(Off TV) What is it?

1149
01:20:36,851 --> 01:20:38,392
(Off TV) I don't know.

1150
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:40,101
(Off TV) Catherine,

1151
01:20:40,309 --> 01:20:41,892
(Off TV) what happened?

1152
01:20:42,184 --> 01:20:45,017
(Off Harry) Alex, it's too much.

1153
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:58,601
(beeps)

1154
01:21:09,642 --> 01:21:11,892
(Off Harry) Before we knew it,
a month had passed.

1155
01:21:12,142 --> 01:21:14,642
Sooner or later,
we'd have to go back.

1156
01:21:14,934 --> 01:21:16,809
But we kept putting it off.

1157
01:21:17,142 --> 01:21:19,642
I was only worried
about your mother and you.

1158
01:21:19,684 --> 01:21:22,142
I hadn't even said goodbye to you,

1159
01:21:22,184 --> 01:21:25,142
and you had all those allergies
when we left.

1160
01:21:26,042 --> 01:21:30,792
(In english) Ok. The man with the bleach
is here. Do we need bleach? No? Ok. Over.

1161
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:39,250
Hi, sorry to interrupt... I just wanted to ask if
you have any possiblilities for work with you here.

1162
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:45,083
Well, we could use the help, especially
now that the high season is about to start.

1163
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:48,625
Have you got any experience?

1164
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:53,500
Yes, I have worked as a secretary
in Madrid. I am quite bilingual.

1165
01:21:54,167 --> 01:21:57,375
She could start working here in the
afternoons... and then we could see.

1166
01:21:58,458 --> 01:22:00,083
Wonderful!

1167
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:06,833
Excuse me, excuse me. We were just saying
that the girl in the ad looks exactly like you.

1168
01:22:13,542 --> 01:22:16,417
No. It's not me.

1169
01:22:06,059 --> 01:22:07,434
OPENING SOON

1170
01:22:10,684 --> 01:22:12,059
GIRLS AND SUITCASES

1171
01:22:23,892 --> 01:22:26,059
I was wondering when he'd turn up.

1172
01:22:26,392 --> 01:22:29,142
But they can't open the film
so soon, can they?

1173
01:22:29,392 --> 01:22:31,934
It's a trick so that we'll go back.

1174
01:22:31,975 --> 01:22:34,642
All the ad needed
was the word "WANTED".

1175
01:22:34,934 --> 01:22:36,142
What'll we do?

1176
01:22:36,434 --> 01:22:38,559
Nothing.
Fuck him!

1177
01:22:50,892 --> 01:22:53,309
PREMIERE TONIGHT

1178
01:22:54,309 --> 01:22:55,517
DISASTER

1179
01:23:28,142 --> 01:23:29,059
What does it say?

1180
01:23:31,267 --> 01:23:34,559
That the only intelligent thing we did
was not attend the premiere.

1181
01:23:35,892 --> 01:23:37,267
Bastards!

1182
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:52,017
(Off Harry) Judit?

1183
01:23:53,392 --> 01:23:54,267
It's me.

1184
01:23:55,517 --> 01:23:57,017
I need to talk to you.

1185
01:23:57,892 --> 01:23:59,559
Call me, please.

1186
01:24:00,434 --> 01:24:01,892
I'll give you the number:

1187
01:24:04,642 --> 01:24:05,559
28 first.

1188
01:24:05,892 --> 01:24:09,392
Sorry: 28845132.

1189
01:24:10,892 --> 01:24:14,184
Ask for Harry Caine.
I'm registered under that name.

1190
01:24:15,767 --> 01:24:16,892
Are you there?

1191
01:24:19,934 --> 01:24:21,392
I'll be expecting your call.

1192
01:24:22,684 --> 01:24:24,309
Mom didn't call you back?

1193
01:24:25,642 --> 01:24:26,642
Why?

1194
01:24:29,517 --> 01:24:31,267
She was angry, I guess.

1195
01:24:32,809 --> 01:24:36,642
Even so, she should've told you
what was happening.

1196
01:24:38,892 --> 01:24:42,017
But she didn't
and we've never talked about it.

1197
01:24:44,642 --> 01:24:46,267
Weren't you curious?

1198
01:24:46,559 --> 01:24:49,142
Me?
I was dying of curiosity!

1199
01:24:49,392 --> 01:24:52,684
For two days I kept calling
your mother and the editor,

1200
01:24:53,017 --> 01:24:54,559
but neither one answered.

1201
01:24:56,267 --> 01:24:58,059
So I decided to go back to Madrid

1202
01:24:58,392 --> 01:25:00,934
and see with my own eyes
what was happening.

1203
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:08,267
It's the first time we've been apart.

1204
01:25:09,392 --> 01:25:11,684
I'll be back on the weekend.

1205
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:16,267
But if you're worried
come with me.

1206
01:25:17,309 --> 01:25:18,767
No, I'm better here.

1207
01:25:20,017 --> 01:25:21,434
Madrid scares me.

1208
01:26:34,517 --> 01:26:37,892
(Off Harry) Magdalena's death
didn't surprise us locked in an embrace,

1209
01:26:37,933 --> 01:26:39,642
as we'd dreamed,

1210
01:26:40,142 --> 01:26:42,392
but sitting in separate seats.

1211
01:26:43,642 --> 01:26:45,892
It even surprised me
by leaving me alive.

1212
01:26:48,517 --> 01:26:49,392
Mateo...

1213
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,642
Say something.

1214
01:26:54,933 --> 01:26:56,433
Mateo is dead Judit.

1215
01:26:58,933 --> 01:27:00,308
Don't say that.

1216
01:27:00,892 --> 01:27:04,183
We address him by his name
but he refuses to answer.

1217
01:27:04,517 --> 01:27:06,183
He insists that Mateo is dead.

1218
01:27:08,642 --> 01:27:11,017
His work revolves around images.

1219
01:27:12,767 --> 01:27:15,517
I guess that for him,
living in the dark

1220
01:27:15,808 --> 01:27:16,808
is death.

1221
01:27:19,642 --> 01:27:21,142
Is there any chance that he'll see?

1222
01:27:21,808 --> 01:27:22,767
None.

1223
01:27:23,683 --> 01:27:28,142
He has what we call
cortical blindness and it's irreversible.

1224
01:27:28,417 --> 01:27:30,083
(Strong wind)

1225
01:27:29,892 --> 01:27:31,767
That's very good.

1226
01:27:37,183 --> 01:27:39,267
There are some steps to the right.

1227
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:43,433
But not here.

1228
01:27:43,767 --> 01:27:45,517
Move forward a bit more.

1229
01:27:48,058 --> 01:27:50,392
I'll guide you to the edge.

1230
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:52,058
Come on.

1231
01:27:54,142 --> 01:27:55,642
That's it.

1232
01:27:57,558 --> 01:27:59,017
We're almost there.

1233
01:28:02,558 --> 01:28:05,017
Now there are a few steps
down to the car.

1234
01:28:05,267 --> 01:28:08,267
We'll take them carefully,
they're very high.

1235
01:28:08,517 --> 01:28:11,142
They're 10 inches,
I measured them earlier.

1236
01:28:11,433 --> 01:28:12,642
Wait, I'll put down your bag.

1237
01:28:15,267 --> 01:28:16,183
Come on.

1238
01:28:20,808 --> 01:28:21,767
Let's go.

1239
01:28:22,517 --> 01:28:25,808
The first step is the hardest,
but I'm holding on to you.

1240
01:28:31,142 --> 01:28:33,017
Yes, slide your feet along.

1241
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:34,892
That's it, let's go.

1242
01:28:35,183 --> 01:28:36,267
Down.

1243
01:28:41,392 --> 01:28:42,433
Very good.

1244
01:28:43,267 --> 01:28:46,183
Now, the second one.
That's right.

1245
01:28:51,017 --> 01:28:52,308
A little more.

1246
01:28:54,642 --> 01:28:56,392
That's it, no more steps

1247
01:28:57,642 --> 01:29:00,392
Did you go to see Lena's mother
in the village?

1248
01:29:02,891 --> 01:29:04,516
What did she say?

1249
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:11,016
She was very grateful to Ernesto
for taking care of everything.

1250
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:16,641
- Is she there?
- Yes.

1251
01:29:18,058 --> 01:29:19,891
They buried her with her father.

1252
01:29:21,433 --> 01:29:22,641
Did you see the grave?

1253
01:29:28,016 --> 01:29:29,141
What's it like?

1254
01:29:31,891 --> 01:29:33,058
Simple.

1255
01:29:33,516 --> 01:29:35,641
Her mother didn't want
anything fancy.

1256
01:29:46,266 --> 01:29:47,891
Look, mom, the sea!

1257
01:29:50,391 --> 01:29:52,058
We're in Famara.

1258
01:29:52,891 --> 01:29:55,058
Stop, please.
I'll get out here.

1259
01:29:55,391 --> 01:29:56,183
No, wait a minute.

1260
01:29:56,225 --> 01:29:57,933
How can you get out?

1261
01:29:59,266 --> 01:30:01,891
Go to Reception
and do what you have to do.

1262
01:30:03,058 --> 01:30:04,433
I'll wait for you on the beach.

1263
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:06,391
I want to get out here too.

1264
01:30:06,683 --> 01:30:08,391
How can you get out in this wind?

1265
01:30:08,683 --> 01:30:11,391
- I don't mind the wind.
- Be quiet, Diego!

1266
01:30:15,016 --> 01:30:16,183
Stop the car please.

1267
01:30:30,516 --> 01:30:33,391
Mom, please, can I stay?

1268
01:30:33,683 --> 01:30:36,641
It's the first time I've seen the sea.

1269
01:30:37,016 --> 01:30:38,016
- Please.
- All right.

1270
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:39,683
- Wrap yourself up.
- OK.

1271
01:30:40,016 --> 01:30:41,433
And don't go near the water.

1272
01:30:41,766 --> 01:30:43,016
Give him your hand.

1273
01:30:43,433 --> 01:30:44,891
Don't let go of him, please.

1274
01:30:46,766 --> 01:30:48,391
You wrap up too.

1275
01:30:56,891 --> 01:30:59,391
Careful, there's a step.

1276
01:31:09,766 --> 01:31:10,766
Let's go.

1277
01:31:21,141 --> 01:31:22,808
Wait for me here, please.

1278
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:38,292
Good morning... (In
english) Good morning.

1279
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:39,750
Good morning. Good morning.

1280
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:42,583
I am here to pay the Mateo
Blanco's bill, please.

1281
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:43,875
Who?

1282
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:45,500
Mateo Blanco.

1283
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:48,917
We dont have anyone here
registered by that name, right?

1284
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:51,958
Its the man who had the accident.

1285
01:31:53,458 --> 01:31:55,792
You mean Harry Caine?

1286
01:31:56,792 --> 01:31:59,250
Yes... of course...

1287
01:33:18,875 --> 01:33:25,792
(Barking and wind)

1288
01:33:43,016 --> 01:33:43,933
(Shouts) Harry Caine!

1289
01:33:47,308 --> 01:33:48,558
We're here!

1290
01:34:00,808 --> 01:34:02,558
We have to go, Harry.

1291
01:34:03,683 --> 01:34:05,433
Come on, Dieguito!

1292
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:08,141
Give me your hand.

1293
01:34:10,766 --> 01:34:12,933
Can't we stay a bit longer?

1294
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:17,516
No, you have to obey your mother.
You've had enough wind for today.

1295
01:34:22,641 --> 01:34:23,933
(whispers) I'm here, Harry.

1296
01:34:25,141 --> 01:34:27,516
Careful you don't trip.

1297
01:34:42,516 --> 01:34:44,433
Do you remember Famara?

1298
01:34:45,766 --> 01:34:49,058
Perfectly. It was the first time
I saw the sea.

1299
01:34:50,266 --> 01:34:53,683
I remember the kites
and a dog that was barking.

1300
01:34:55,516 --> 01:34:58,183
I remember the dog barking too.

1301
01:35:07,766 --> 01:35:08,516
What are you doing?

1302
01:35:09,558 --> 01:35:12,266
I'm trying to reconstruct
some of your photos.

1303
01:35:30,641 --> 01:35:32,391
I've got one that's almost complete.

1304
01:35:36,558 --> 01:35:38,141
What do you want to see
to cheer you up?

1305
01:35:38,516 --> 01:35:40,433
I'd like to hear
Jeanne Moreau's voice.

1306
01:35:40,891 --> 01:35:42,016
I don't have her number.

1307
01:35:42,766 --> 01:35:45,308
Find "Elevator to the Gallows",
by Louis Malle.

1308
01:35:47,058 --> 01:35:48,308
Fritz Lang...

1309
01:35:48,641 --> 01:35:50,808
Jules Dassin, Nicholas Ray...

1310
01:35:50,849 --> 01:35:52,391
Look up above.

1311
01:35:55,141 --> 01:35:58,516
Fanny and Alexander, Fellini 81/2,
Magnificent Obsession...

1312
01:35:59,058 --> 01:36:01,433
Elevator to the Gallows!
Here it is.

1313
01:36:01,766 --> 01:36:03,057
I've never seen it.

1314
01:36:03,266 --> 01:36:04,807
I hope you like it.

1315
01:36:09,516 --> 01:36:11,016
(TV) How can I throw it out?

1316
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:13,807
The police have to find it...

1317
01:36:14,141 --> 01:36:16,516
Leave it!
It's "Girls and Suitcases".

1318
01:36:17,266 --> 01:36:18,682
I don't understand.

1319
01:36:20,057 --> 01:36:21,307
It's simple babe.

1320
01:36:22,266 --> 01:36:26,057
If the cops find 30 pounds
of uncut cocaine in my house

1321
01:36:26,391 --> 01:36:27,641
they could arrest me.

1322
01:36:29,766 --> 01:36:34,016
But I don't understand how
that suitcase appeared in your house.

1323
01:36:36,182 --> 01:36:37,641
Doesn't it sound odd?

1324
01:36:41,891 --> 01:36:43,557
As I was saying,

1325
01:36:45,391 --> 01:36:47,516
after I split up with my husband

1326
01:36:48,391 --> 01:36:49,766
I went out on the street
and there was a guy eyeing me,

1327
01:36:50,016 --> 01:36:53,391
good-looking.
his ass... his feet...

1328
01:36:54,891 --> 01:36:56,891
I brought him home
and screwed him several times.

1329
01:36:57,141 --> 01:36:59,141
They're completely off key.

1330
01:36:59,391 --> 01:37:00,432
In bed?

1331
01:37:01,557 --> 01:37:02,641
A virtuoso.

1332
01:37:03,057 --> 01:37:05,182
Look, my hairs are standing on end.

1333
01:37:05,224 --> 01:37:08,141
How could I have chosen those takes?
They're both terrible!

1334
01:37:12,141 --> 01:37:13,641
What do you want to do today?

1335
01:37:14,891 --> 01:37:15,891
I have to go home.

1336
01:37:16,682 --> 01:37:21,057
Mom left a message that she's coming back today,
to celebrate your birthday.

1337
01:37:22,557 --> 01:37:23,766
It's my birthday?

1338
01:37:24,891 --> 01:37:26,141
That's what she says.

1339
01:37:26,891 --> 01:37:27,891
If Judit says so...

1340
01:37:29,141 --> 01:37:30,141
Happy Birthday!

1341
01:37:30,766 --> 01:37:32,932
I'll have to take you out to dinner.

1342
01:37:38,807 --> 01:37:40,516
Anyone at home?

1343
01:37:44,516 --> 01:37:45,766
Love,

1344
01:37:46,516 --> 01:37:48,057
I was dying to see you.

1345
01:37:51,891 --> 01:37:52,891
What's up?

1346
01:37:53,432 --> 01:37:54,891
Do they show a lot?

1347
01:37:56,432 --> 01:37:59,266
Today I didn't even have time
to wipe my ass.

1348
01:38:00,016 --> 01:38:01,516
Don't look at me like that.

1349
01:38:01,557 --> 01:38:03,307
I thought you'd be used to it.

1350
01:38:03,641 --> 01:38:04,682
Yes, I'm sorry.

1351
01:38:06,016 --> 01:38:08,182
You're so handsome!

1352
01:38:09,141 --> 01:38:11,807
Are you all right?
I was worried about you.

1353
01:38:12,266 --> 01:38:13,307
I'm fine.

1354
01:38:13,766 --> 01:38:15,557
Mateo looked after me day and night.

1355
01:38:15,891 --> 01:38:16,766
Mateo?

1356
01:38:17,891 --> 01:38:19,516
Don't you call him Harry anymore?

1357
01:38:24,557 --> 01:38:26,432
We have to buy him
a birthday present.

1358
01:38:28,891 --> 01:38:31,391
What have you been doing
all this time?

1359
01:38:31,641 --> 01:38:32,557
Nothing...

1360
01:38:32,891 --> 01:38:35,307
Watching films and talking.

1361
01:38:36,182 --> 01:38:37,057
Talking?

1362
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:40,141
(Dry) About what?

1363
01:38:41,141 --> 01:38:42,391
Mom, for God's sake!

1364
01:38:49,432 --> 01:38:51,141
And what was wrong with you?

1365
01:38:51,391 --> 01:38:53,557
I'm not sure if
I believe the gastoenteritis.

1366
01:38:53,891 --> 01:38:56,266
You used it as an excuse in a script.

1367
01:38:56,682 --> 01:38:59,932
I had an accident, but I'd rather
not talk about it now.

1368
01:39:01,057 --> 01:39:02,307
An accident?

1369
01:39:03,141 --> 01:39:04,682
What kind of accident?

1370
01:39:05,766 --> 01:39:09,182
- It's hard to explain.
- Try, I'm not so dumb!

1371
01:39:09,516 --> 01:39:11,891
We'll leave it for another day.
I'm fine now.

1372
01:39:14,141 --> 01:39:16,557
I'm going to buy some DVDs for Mateo.

1373
01:39:52,932 --> 01:39:56,390
I don't know what you've talked about
all these days,

1374
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:01,640
but I do know what I haven't told you
in all these years.

1375
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:04,140
I never asked you.

1376
01:40:04,182 --> 01:40:07,265
But you'll have asked yourself
a thousand times.

1377
01:40:08,057 --> 01:40:10,307
This is your birthday present, Mateo.

1378
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:14,015
It's also for you, Diego.

1379
01:40:19,515 --> 01:40:23,557
After you two disappeared,
Ernesto Sr. only wanted revenge.

1380
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:24,890
- Forget it, Judit.
- No.

1381
01:40:26,182 --> 01:40:28,640
- You've had a bad day today
- That's why.

1382
01:40:28,932 --> 01:40:31,390
I'd like to end it better.

1383
01:40:33,265 --> 01:40:36,390
Ernesto had a crazy plan
to get his revenge on you,

1384
01:40:37,390 --> 01:40:40,265
but to carry it out
he had to bribe us,

1385
01:40:40,557 --> 01:40:43,390
at least, me and Luis, the editor.

1386
01:40:45,015 --> 01:40:48,140
Even though it was crazy,
there was no problem.

1387
01:40:48,557 --> 01:40:51,015
We both sold out
without any objection.

1388
01:40:51,307 --> 01:40:52,390
Luis and I.

1389
01:40:54,307 --> 01:40:55,390
With me,

1390
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:58,557
he was courteous enough
to provide me with an alibi.

1391
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:03,182
He suggested I went to the U.S.
for six weeks, to the Mayo Clinic

1392
01:41:03,515 --> 01:41:06,807
so Diego could be cured
of his aspergilosis.

1393
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:10,140
That way,
I wouldn't be present while he...

1394
01:41:10,765 --> 01:41:12,515
destroyed your film.

1395
01:41:13,932 --> 01:41:16,015
Because that was his plan:

1396
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:18,932
To reduce the film to rubble.

1397
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:26,890
I prefered to stay in Madrid

1398
01:41:27,182 --> 01:41:28,932
and have Diego cured here.

1399
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,515
I wanted to witness everything.

1400
01:41:31,807 --> 01:41:33,390
If I was to betray you,

1401
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,057
I wanted to suffer the price
I had to pay.

1402
01:41:40,057 --> 01:41:41,557
It was torture

1403
01:41:42,432 --> 01:41:45,640
seeing how Ernesto chose
all the worst takes

1404
01:41:45,682 --> 01:41:47,140
and how Luis edited them,

1405
01:41:47,182 --> 01:41:49,890
turning your film into a monster.

1406
01:41:52,015 --> 01:41:55,765
The only way to bear all that
was to suffer more.

1407
01:41:57,057 --> 01:42:00,765
I sold myself to Ernesto
out of pain and jealousy.

1408
01:42:01,557 --> 01:42:03,307
I couldn't bear or forgive

1409
01:42:03,349 --> 01:42:06,890
that you left with Lena
without saying a word.

1410
01:42:08,015 --> 01:42:11,640
With my treachery, I got my revenge
on you, on her and on myself.

1411
01:42:13,807 --> 01:42:15,890
The only innocent one was Diego.

1412
01:42:17,765 --> 01:42:19,140
Forgive me my love,

1413
01:42:19,932 --> 01:42:23,015
for how bitter I've been
all these years.

1414
01:42:24,432 --> 01:42:26,932
No one deserves to grow up with that.

1415
01:42:44,307 --> 01:42:46,515
Another gin and tonic, please.

1416
01:42:55,890 --> 01:42:57,390
Don't look at me like that.

1417
01:43:22,807 --> 01:43:25,515
Don't go on.
It isn't necessary.

1418
01:43:27,307 --> 01:43:30,182
Now that you're calling yourself
Mateo again, I've got no excuse.

1419
01:43:30,515 --> 01:43:32,140
You've told us everything.

1420
01:43:35,515 --> 01:43:36,557
No, not everything.

1421
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:49,307
No one knew where you were.
We had no idea.

1422
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,265
Ernesto organized all that,

1423
01:43:52,515 --> 01:43:55,515
the premiere, all that fuss,
so that you'd react.

1424
01:43:56,057 --> 01:44:00,015
His revenge was meaningless
if neither of you responded.

1425
01:44:01,515 --> 01:44:04,765
He asked me constantly
about your whereabouts

1426
01:44:05,057 --> 01:44:08,265
but I knew nothing either,
which was true.

1427
01:44:08,557 --> 01:44:12,265
That's why I didn't wan't to call you,
so as not to complicate your life.

1428
01:44:13,765 --> 01:44:17,140
Ernesto hired various detectives
to look for you.

1429
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:20,307
But before they could find you.

1430
01:44:21,432 --> 01:44:22,765
You called me

1431
01:44:23,682 --> 01:44:25,765
two days after the premiere.

1432
01:44:28,515 --> 01:44:32,682
I was too ashamed to answer

1433
01:44:33,807 --> 01:44:36,640
and too dazed.
I still am.

1434
01:44:39,432 --> 01:44:42,265
When Ernesto asked me
about you again,

1435
01:44:43,932 --> 01:44:45,265
I don't know why,

1436
01:44:46,515 --> 01:44:48,765
I gave him the number in Famara.

1437
01:44:53,182 --> 01:44:56,307
He sent his son
to look for you on Lanzarote.

1438
01:45:04,765 --> 01:45:08,182
It was Ernesto Jr.
who found you after the accident

1439
01:45:08,765 --> 01:45:10,265
and called the hospital.

1440
01:45:10,557 --> 01:45:12,682
Did he have anything
to do with the accident?

1441
01:45:14,515 --> 01:45:16,390
But I keep thinking

1442
01:45:16,432 --> 01:45:19,015
that if I hadn't given
that number to his father

1443
01:45:19,265 --> 01:45:21,557
perhaps nothing would have happened.

1444
01:45:24,682 --> 01:45:26,057
Why do you think that?

1445
01:45:28,765 --> 01:45:29,682
I don't know.

1446
01:45:30,932 --> 01:45:32,557
A guilty conscience, I suppose.

1447
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:34,015
Well, that's enough!

1448
01:45:34,307 --> 01:45:37,140
14 years with a guilty conscience
is enough.

1449
01:46:04,890 --> 01:46:06,515
Wait, I'll help you down.

1450
01:46:09,432 --> 01:46:10,515
Good night.

1451
01:46:18,057 --> 01:46:19,765
Call if you need anything.

1452
01:46:39,625 --> 01:46:43,750
(mobile phone)

1453
01:46:46,431 --> 01:46:47,265
(Off answering machine) Diego...

1454
01:46:47,306 --> 01:46:50,056
Is not available.
Leave a message.

1455
01:46:51,681 --> 01:46:52,681
Hey Diego, it's Mateo.

1456
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:57,640
I'm sorry to call so early.

1457
01:46:58,556 --> 01:47:00,515
Tell your mother to call me
when she can.

1458
01:47:34,515 --> 01:47:35,890
Harry, why so early?

1459
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:37,556
I couldn't sleep.

1460
01:47:38,265 --> 01:47:39,306
Coffee and toast?

1461
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,890
Yes, but first would you

1462
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:43,390
call this number for me?

1463
01:47:45,890 --> 01:47:47,265
Ray X?

1464
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:55,640
Here.

1465
01:47:56,515 --> 01:47:57,931
I'll get your coffee.

1466
01:48:00,515 --> 01:48:01,431
(Off) Who is this?

1467
01:48:01,765 --> 01:48:03,181
Sorry to disturb you.

1468
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:05,265
This is Mateo Blanco.

1469
01:48:20,890 --> 01:48:22,306
Look at this!

1470
01:48:23,306 --> 01:48:25,140
You have to start the day well.

1471
01:48:28,515 --> 01:48:29,765
How do you feel?

1472
01:48:30,265 --> 01:48:32,640
A little bit hung over
but OK.

1473
01:48:33,765 --> 01:48:36,640
I think the catharsis last night
did me good.

1474
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:39,931
- Let me help you
- No, sit down.

1475
01:48:46,265 --> 01:48:48,765
Yesterday I had one more thing
to tell you.

1476
01:48:49,056 --> 01:48:51,556
Tell me later.
We'll have breakfast now.

1477
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:55,015
If I don't tell you now,
I may never tell you.

1478
01:48:56,931 --> 01:48:58,765
At the end of the 80s

1479
01:48:59,306 --> 01:49:01,890
Mateo and I,
had a love affair.

1480
01:49:03,265 --> 01:49:04,890
I thought so,

1481
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:06,931
even before the catharsis last night.

1482
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,056
- You did?
- It's obvious!

1483
01:49:10,098 --> 01:49:12,431
The same curtains
in your bedroom and in his,

1484
01:49:12,473 --> 01:49:14,515
souvenirs of Mexico and the Caribbean
in both houses,

1485
01:49:14,765 --> 01:49:15,890
the crosses...

1486
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:20,140
There's something else you don't know.

1487
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:24,765
Mateo is your father.

1488
01:49:25,931 --> 01:49:27,265
My father?

1489
01:49:30,765 --> 01:49:32,140
And the fleeting lover?

1490
01:49:33,015 --> 01:49:34,890
My supposed biological father?

1491
01:49:35,765 --> 01:49:37,015
Did you make him up?

1492
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:39,931
I can hide things,

1493
01:49:40,265 --> 01:49:42,515
but I'm incapable
of making things up.

1494
01:49:43,640 --> 01:49:45,640
The fleeting lover existed.

1495
01:49:46,015 --> 01:49:48,140
We had an affair.
He was gay

1496
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,806
and the affair was very brief.

1497
01:49:54,056 --> 01:49:55,515
Does Mateo know?

1498
01:49:56,681 --> 01:49:58,015
Are you crazy?

1499
01:49:58,431 --> 01:50:01,264
At the time he asked me
and I denied it, of course.

1500
01:50:02,014 --> 01:50:03,889
I didn't want
to pressure him

1501
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:06,056
I didn't want that
to change our relationship.

1502
01:50:06,389 --> 01:50:08,806
And I'd never asked him
if he wanted to be a father.

1503
01:50:10,389 --> 01:50:11,306
Fuck!

1504
01:50:11,348 --> 01:50:13,306
So Mateo is my father...

1505
01:50:15,806 --> 01:50:18,139
By the way,
he rang early this morning.

1506
01:50:19,306 --> 01:50:20,764
Mateo? What did he want?

1507
01:50:21,139 --> 01:50:22,264
For you to call him.

1508
01:50:22,556 --> 01:50:24,181
Why didn't you wake me?

1509
01:50:24,514 --> 01:50:27,639
Because after last night you
needed to rest

1510
01:50:27,889 --> 01:50:29,431
and he didn't say it was urgent.

1511
01:50:29,764 --> 01:50:31,306
Pass me the phone.

1512
01:50:38,889 --> 01:50:42,306
Diego told me you called.
Are you OK? Do you need anything?

1513
01:50:42,681 --> 01:50:44,056
No, I'm not OK.

1514
01:50:44,389 --> 01:50:46,431
And yes, I do need something.

1515
01:50:47,014 --> 01:50:49,264
The 40,000 meters of negative

1516
01:50:49,306 --> 01:50:51,389
we shot in my last film, to edit it.

1517
01:50:52,764 --> 01:50:53,889
I'm at Ernesto Jr.'s house.

1518
01:50:54,514 --> 01:50:58,139
and I've found out that
the material was destroyed in '94.

1519
01:50:59,389 --> 01:51:01,181
I imagined something like that

1520
01:51:01,806 --> 01:51:03,431
but I didn't think
they'd do it so soon.

1521
01:51:03,473 --> 01:51:04,931
Why are you in Ernesto's house?

1522
01:51:05,306 --> 01:51:06,931
I think I'll blackmail him.

1523
01:51:07,889 --> 01:51:10,056
We need money
and he's got lots to spare.

1524
01:51:10,098 --> 01:51:12,514
I don't want Diego
going back to that damn bar.

1525
01:51:12,806 --> 01:51:14,514
I want to pay him a salary.

1526
01:51:17,181 --> 01:51:18,556
Don't be crazy!

1527
01:51:19,014 --> 01:51:21,556
There's no one else
to accuse of Magdalena's death.

1528
01:51:25,639 --> 01:51:27,389
Wait, I've got something to tell you.

1529
01:51:27,431 --> 01:51:30,056
Last night you said enough.

1530
01:51:30,389 --> 01:51:31,639
Listen to me!

1531
01:51:32,681 --> 01:51:34,889
I was production manager
on the film.

1532
01:51:35,181 --> 01:51:38,056
the only person with access
to the lab and the material.

1533
01:51:39,639 --> 01:51:43,639
After giving Ernesto's order
to destroy it, I intercepted it

1534
01:51:44,264 --> 01:51:45,139
I've got it all at home.

1535
01:51:46,431 --> 01:51:47,764
You're lying.

1536
01:51:48,764 --> 01:51:51,931
I didn't tell you last night because
I didn't know you wanted to edit it.

1537
01:51:52,806 --> 01:51:54,181
I took it all,

1538
01:51:55,014 --> 01:51:58,764
the double takes, the interneg,
the sound tapes, everything!

1539
01:51:59,139 --> 01:52:00,764
You can have it all.

1540
01:52:01,264 --> 01:52:02,264
That changes everything.

1541
01:52:02,306 --> 01:52:04,056
Get out of there, Mateo

1542
01:52:04,431 --> 01:52:06,056
and leave Ernesto in peace.

1543
01:52:06,389 --> 01:52:07,764
He's got nothing to do with this.

1544
01:52:08,014 --> 01:52:10,639
He still has to tell me
why he was in Lanzarote.

1545
01:52:10,889 --> 01:52:13,181
Bye, Judit.
I'll call you later.

1546
01:52:21,556 --> 01:52:23,264
Ernesto and his camera.

1547
01:52:25,014 --> 01:52:26,514
You remind me of a Peeping Tom

1548
01:52:29,139 --> 01:52:30,514
Yes,
but I never wanted to kill you.

1549
01:52:31,264 --> 01:52:32,639
I'm not so sure.

1550
01:52:35,639 --> 01:52:37,556
This copy of "The making of"
will prove it.

1551
01:52:39,889 --> 01:52:42,014
Why do I want it?
I can't see it.

1552
01:52:42,264 --> 01:52:45,014
Someone you trust can see it
and tell you. Excuse me.

1553
01:52:47,014 --> 01:52:49,764
These are the final images of
the documentary on Mateo Blanco,

1554
01:52:50,264 --> 01:52:51,889
also known as Harry Caine.

1555
01:53:37,139 --> 01:53:39,639
How's the "documentary",
as Ernesto calls it?

1556
01:53:42,139 --> 01:53:43,264
Very interesting.

1557
01:53:45,139 --> 01:53:46,306
What are you seeing now?

1558
01:53:48,264 --> 01:53:50,931
The last night
coming back from the restaurant.

1559
01:53:51,389 --> 01:53:54,181
How could he film us?
It was dark.

1560
01:53:56,764 --> 01:53:59,639
His headlights and the lighting
on the mobile sculpture

1561
01:54:00,139 --> 01:54:01,889
were enough to see what happened.

1562
01:54:03,264 --> 01:54:06,139
And he's retouched it digitally.

1563
01:54:07,764 --> 01:54:11,056
Ernesto didn't cause the accident,

1564
01:54:11,514 --> 01:54:13,764
and, as well,
he was the first to help you.

1565
01:54:14,389 --> 01:54:16,181
How could he film and drive at the same time?

1566
01:54:17,389 --> 01:54:18,514
I don't know.

1567
01:54:19,889 --> 01:54:21,639
Anything else I should know?

1568
01:54:23,889 --> 01:54:25,139
What are you watching now?

1569
01:54:26,931 --> 01:54:30,264
When you were waiting at the roundabout
for a car to pass on your left,

1570
01:54:30,889 --> 01:54:32,764
Lena and you kissed.

1571
01:54:34,014 --> 01:54:35,014
We kissed?
I don't remember that.

1572
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:40,514
It's a normal kiss, the kind couples give
each other out of habit.

1573
01:54:42,389 --> 01:54:43,681
The last kiss.

1574
01:54:48,181 --> 01:54:51,389
Lena didn't die in your arms
like you'd dreamed,

1575
01:54:52,681 --> 01:54:55,306
but the last sensation
she took from this world

1576
01:54:55,764 --> 01:54:57,514
was the taste of your mouth.

1577
01:55:07,014 --> 01:55:07,764
Is it here?

1578
01:55:13,181 --> 01:55:16,264
Play it frame by frame
so that it lasts longer.

1579
01:55:57,139 --> 01:55:59,264
(Off Harry) 14 years after shooting it,

1580
01:55:59,639 --> 01:56:02,139
I could finally edit
"Girls and Suitcases".

1581
01:56:17,264 --> 01:56:18,014
It's you.

1582
01:56:18,056 --> 01:56:20,806
- Did you get my messages!
- 1,000 from you and none from Ivan!

1583
01:56:21,639 --> 01:56:22,764
What's that suitcase?

1584
01:56:22,806 --> 01:56:24,556
It's Iván's. He's leaving me.

1585
01:56:25,139 --> 01:56:26,139
and the crutches?

1586
01:56:26,181 --> 01:56:29,389
His ex-wife, the lunatic,
pushed me down the stairs.

1587
01:56:29,806 --> 01:56:32,014
I've split up with my husband too.

1588
01:56:32,514 --> 01:56:33,764
I'm sorry.

1589
01:56:34,556 --> 01:56:36,889
I've made coffee,
do you mind pouring it?

1590
01:56:37,389 --> 01:56:39,264
I was looking for Ivan all night.

1591
01:56:39,764 --> 01:56:42,639
Then I had a photo session
and I still haven't slept.

1592
01:56:42,931 --> 01:56:44,056
Neither have K

1593
01:56:44,889 --> 01:56:47,389
- When did you two split up?
- Four days ago.

1594
01:56:47,806 --> 01:56:48,764
Sugar?

1595
01:56:49,764 --> 01:56:50,931
I saw it coming.

1596
01:56:51,389 --> 01:56:55,139
But after we broke up,
I went out on the street

1597
01:56:55,556 --> 01:56:57,639
and saw a guy looking at me.
Gazpacho! I'll have some.

1598
01:56:58,681 --> 01:57:00,264
I put in a whole box
of sleeping pills.

1599
01:57:01,597 --> 01:57:02,389
Why?

1600
01:57:03,389 --> 01:57:06,055
In case Ivan came.
He loves gazpacho.

1601
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:07,889
Really, Pina!

1602
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:10,889
That's nothing. Since he didn't call.
I tore out the phone.

1603
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:14,764
I tripped over it but I didn't ask
because I didn't want to be nosy.

1604
01:57:16,264 --> 01:57:17,305
The bed?

1605
01:57:17,889 --> 01:57:19,389
Is that smoke?

1606
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:23,514
I dropped a match and it went on fire.
I didn't want to put it out.

1607
01:57:24,055 --> 01:57:25,305
Fire purifies.

1608
01:57:25,764 --> 01:57:27,055
Get your coffee.

1609
01:57:31,389 --> 01:57:33,264
Were you telling me something?

1610
01:57:41,014 --> 01:57:43,305
I was telling you...

1611
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:46,264
that I've got a suitcase at home too.

1612
01:57:46,764 --> 01:57:47,514
Your husband's?

1613
01:57:49,639 --> 01:57:52,389
A suitcase with 30 pounds
of top quality, uncut cocaine.

1614
01:57:54,055 --> 01:57:55,014
Are you a dealer now?

1615
01:57:55,514 --> 01:57:57,514
No! I'm still a councilor
for Social Affairs.

1616
01:57:58,139 --> 01:58:00,805
The suitcase appeared in my closet,
all of a sudden.

1617
01:58:03,389 --> 01:58:06,014
I have to get rid of those 30 pounds
right away.

1618
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:08,889
There's a lot of drugs in politics,
because of the hours.

1619
01:58:09,305 --> 01:58:12,639
Between the party and the Council,
I could shift five pounds.

1620
01:58:13,055 --> 01:58:14,180
But the rest?

1621
01:58:14,514 --> 01:58:17,139
- Throw it away.
- Are you crazy?

1622
01:58:17,389 --> 01:58:20,055
I have to make sure the police
don't find it in my house.

1623
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:22,889
- I don't understand...
- It's obvious!

1624
01:58:22,930 --> 01:58:26,889
If they catch me with all that cocaine
they'll arrest me.

1625
01:58:27,305 --> 01:58:30,764
Yes, but I don't understand how
the suitcase got in your closet.

1626
01:58:35,514 --> 01:58:36,764
As I was saying,

1627
01:58:37,014 --> 01:58:40,514
after I split up with my husband,
I went out on the street

1628
01:58:41,514 --> 01:58:42,555
and there was a guy eyeing at me,
good-looking!

1629
01:58:43,264 --> 01:58:44,305
His ass!

1630
01:58:44,764 --> 01:58:46,014
His feet!

1631
01:58:46,555 --> 01:58:48,514
I brought him home
and screwed him several times.

1632
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:51,889
I'm very interested in sex
as a social matter.

1633
01:58:53,764 --> 01:58:54,514
How was it?

1634
01:58:55,139 --> 01:58:57,014
In bed? A virtuoso!

1635
01:58:57,514 --> 01:58:58,764
I've never seen anything like it!

1636
01:59:00,389 --> 01:59:01,764
What a big toe!

1637
01:59:02,889 --> 01:59:04,555
Look, my hairs are standing on end.

1638
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:06,639
Then what happened?

1639
01:59:07,055 --> 01:59:10,639
After we screwed, he asked if he could
stay with me for a few days.

1640
01:59:11,514 --> 01:59:14,180
- Got any muffins?
- Yes, on the shelf.

1641
01:59:15,639 --> 01:59:17,180
And there's a creme caramel.

1642
01:59:17,222 --> 01:59:18,889
I'll have that afterwards.

1643
01:59:20,264 --> 01:59:23,555
So, he asked if he could stay
and I said all right,

1644
01:59:23,889 --> 01:59:27,389
but I wasnt promising anything.
I didn't want him to think I was easy.

1645
01:59:27,805 --> 01:59:31,180
Anyway, he turned up
with a suitcase and moved in.

1646
01:59:33,055 --> 01:59:35,264
Last night, on TV,

1647
01:59:36,139 --> 01:59:40,389
I saw he'd been arrested
in a drug bust.

1648
01:59:41,264 --> 01:59:44,014
He's one of the biggest
drug traffickers in the country.

1649
01:59:44,930 --> 01:59:46,014
What?

1650
01:59:47,555 --> 01:59:49,305
So, kind of suspicious,

1651
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:51,764
I open the suitcase

1652
01:59:52,430 --> 01:59:55,305
and I find it full
of bags of cocaine.

1653
01:59:59,389 --> 02:00:00,264
I took one,

1654
02:00:01,639 --> 02:00:04,055
went out on the street
and haven't been back since.

1655
02:00:06,389 --> 02:00:07,639
What a story!

1656
02:00:08,139 --> 02:00:10,264
I was surprised he screwed so well.

1657
02:00:12,014 --> 02:00:15,639
For men who live at that level of risk,
it's like evey screw is the last.

1658
02:00:16,139 --> 02:00:17,639
And there is no comparison.

1659
02:00:18,055 --> 02:00:19,514
Look at those goose bumps!

1660
02:00:20,014 --> 02:00:22,264
Yeah, I saw it before,
You've got a talent...

1661
02:00:22,889 --> 02:00:23,889
And the suitcase?

1662
02:00:28,014 --> 02:00:30,388
I was going to ask
if I could bring it here?

1663
02:00:31,513 --> 02:00:32,388
You hear?

1664
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:34,888
(Off) I'll bring it here.

1665
02:00:35,555 --> 02:00:36,888
If they find it in my house,
it's not for what could happen to me,

1666
02:00:37,305 --> 02:00:40,888
although it's not ideal for
a councilor for social affairs,

1667
02:00:41,305 --> 02:00:43,263
but the mayor would be so upset.

1668
02:00:43,305 --> 02:00:46,888
And my party?
It couldn't take another scandal!

1669
02:00:47,388 --> 02:00:48,638
Don't shout.

1670
02:00:48,731 --> 02:00:49,574
(doorbell)

1671
02:00:49,638 --> 02:00:50,388
(whispers) The police!

1672
02:00:51,138 --> 02:00:53,763
How could it be?
No one knows you are here.

1673
02:00:54,263 --> 02:00:56,763
I've been
very striking since I was a child.

1674
02:00:56,805 --> 02:00:59,263
Act like you've come for coffee.

1675
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:17,305
That's what we've got re-edited.

1676
02:01:18,805 --> 02:01:20,888
Do you think it's worth carrying on,

1677
02:01:21,555 --> 02:01:22,888
or is it crazy?

1678
02:01:23,388 --> 02:01:25,513
What?
I pissed myself laughing!

1679
02:01:26,013 --> 02:01:27,638
I'm dying to see what happens.

1680
02:01:32,013 --> 02:01:33,513
(Emotional) It's wonderful, Mateo.

1681
02:01:34,263 --> 02:01:36,013
It's hilarious.
You have to re-release it.

1682
02:01:36,055 --> 02:01:38,263
No, what matters is to finish it.

1683
02:01:38,638 --> 02:01:41,888
Films have to be finished,
even if you do it blindly.

1684
02:01:59,763 --> 02:02:01,013
