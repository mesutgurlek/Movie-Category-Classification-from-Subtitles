1
00:00:04,597 --> 00:00:06,214
Buy passage far from Capua

2
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,097
and the things that
have been done to you.

3
00:00:08,165 --> 00:00:09,399
I will see you again one day.

4
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,734
Go.

5
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:16,007
<i>Dagan is now blind
to attack from the right.</i>

6
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:18,076
<i>I cannot stay within
these walls</i>

7
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,878
<i>and be denied your touch.</i>

8
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:22,546
<i>Why did you drop your guard?</i>

9
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:23,948
You are champion now.

10
00:00:24,015 --> 00:00:25,582
That is all that matters.

11
00:00:26,617 --> 00:00:28,519
<i>I have come to make amends</i>

12
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:30,687
with a gift.

13
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:33,890
A more permanent solution
was required between us.

14
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,759
<i>One that I added
to Tullius' gift.</i>

15
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:38,227
I would share drink.

16
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:45,433
<i>Quintus will not forgive
Tullius this</i>

17
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:48,570
<i>and Gaia's death
with be avenged.</i>

18
00:00:48,770 --> 00:01:29,970
warwerwor

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,281
It is a heavy thing...

20
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:35,882
Seeing a father,
so strong in life,

21
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,417
unable to rise.

22
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,486
The weight of it keenly felt.

23
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:42,588
Titus was much loved
by this city.

24
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,324
Hold comfort in the knowledge.

25
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:56,870
The magistrate himself
pays respect?

26
00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:59,072
It's a great honor.

27
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,774
For my father.

28
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:04,211
Years I wished for
blistering tongue to cool.

29
00:02:04,279 --> 00:02:06,746
Only to long for it
to scorch ear once more.

30
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:11,417
<i>I know you did not wish
him gone in such a manner.</i>

31
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,020
Nor did I,
despite our many differences.

32
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:19,324
Yet the gods have willed it.

33
00:02:19,392 --> 00:02:22,327
The gods had no
fucking hand in this.

34
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:24,829
Tullius' alone inflicts injury.

35
00:02:26,566 --> 00:02:29,268
And how shall it be answered?

36
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:31,002
Apologies.

37
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,004
Unwelcome guest
makes appearance.

38
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:39,078
Vettius.

39
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:42,883
Temper emotion, and greet him
with measured voice.

40
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,485
It would serve no purpose
to have confrontation here

41
00:02:44,552 --> 00:02:46,420
in front of the Magistrate.

42
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:49,656
Good Batiatus.

43
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:53,393
My sympathy for
the passing of your father.

44
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:56,697
A titan, standing far
above all who follow.

45
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:57,764
You come absent Tullius?

46
00:02:57,832 --> 00:02:58,765
I thought nothing
could keep the man

47
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,968
from observance
of such a tragedy.

48
00:03:01,036 --> 00:03:04,071
He confers with dignitaries
from Antioch.

49
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,339
Antioch?

50
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:06,740
<i>He is engaged
in business there,</i>

51
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:09,076
to the further glory
of the Republic.

52
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:11,912
<i>He sends regret that
he could not be present.</i>

53
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,314
And a reminder

54
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:18,586
that a bargain was struck with
your father before he passed.

55
00:03:18,654 --> 00:03:20,988
<i>Concerning the sale
of Gannicus.</i>

56
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:23,557
You dare broach subject
on such a fucking day?

57
00:03:25,226 --> 00:03:28,162
We have respectfully waited
for eight of them to pass.

58
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:31,699
<i>Your period of mourning
comes to conclusion.</i>

59
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:34,568
<i>Tomorrow the sun
greets a ninth day,</i>

60
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:37,972
and with it we expect
delivery of Gannicus.

61
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,975
Turn desire towards
piss and shit,

62
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:43,577
<i>and see yourselves
well satisfied.</i>

63
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,045
<i>Then Tullius will be forced
to withdraw offer</i>

64
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:46,714
to include your men
in the opening games

65
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:47,916
of the new arena.

66
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,852
And all that follow.

67
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:11,036
<i>Apologies.</i>

68
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,038
Batiatus summons the men.

69
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:27,251
You will see her ashes
beneath the ground?

70
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:31,189
As is her people's custom.

71
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,025
<i>I did not know of them.</i>

72
00:04:35,494 --> 00:04:38,063
There were many things that
I did not pause to ask her of.

73
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:42,668
Now I am but filled
with questions.

74
00:04:42,736 --> 00:04:45,037
Speak of her, in quiet moments.

75
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:46,305
And see them answered.

76
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:50,709
Oenomaus...

77
00:04:55,013 --> 00:04:56,881
She was the rarest of women.

78
00:04:58,617 --> 00:05:00,719
A flower of beauty
and compassion,

79
00:05:00,786 --> 00:05:02,353
in a world of shit.

80
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:05,723
<i>I would assume her place,</i>

81
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,992
so that her laugh
may once again fill solemn air.

82
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:10,795
She would not wish it.

83
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:15,199
She loved you.

84
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,269
As a brother.

85
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,373
As I loved her.

86
00:05:33,986 --> 00:05:36,287
<i>We have known
the agony of heart ripped</i>

87
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:38,724
<i>yet beating
from sundered chest.</i>

88
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:42,061
And yet here we stand.

89
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,365
The House of Batiatus
is no stranger to misfortune.

90
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,335
<i>To the cruel whims of the gods,</i>

91
00:05:49,403 --> 00:05:52,004
<i>and base men that would
position themselves as such.</i>

92
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:53,005
And yet.

93
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:54,940
Here we stand.

94
00:05:58,144 --> 00:06:01,613
This house is built
atop unshakable foundation

95
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:03,916
of honor and respect.

96
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:08,855
<i>And in no man were these
qualities more evident</i>

97
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:11,157
than Titus Lentulus Batiatus.

98
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:15,194
<i>I will laud my father's memory</i>

99
00:06:15,262 --> 00:06:17,864
<i>by seeing
the House of Batiatus elevated</i>

100
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:20,399
<i>beyond the imagining
of my ancestors.</i>

101
00:06:21,535 --> 00:06:24,303
<i>I will need all
of you to see it done.</i>

102
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:27,840
Men of hard purpose and desire.

103
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:32,011
Let previous
decisions fall aside.

104
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,513
None among you will
be sent to the mines,

105
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,281
<i>regardless of standing!</i>

106
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:43,721
<i>The sun has set on an era.</i>

107
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:49,060
<i>Let us celebrate the name
Titus Lentulus Batiatus</i>

108
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:51,629
with drink
and the clash of swords!

109
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:53,898
Their sound to carry my father
to the afterlife!

110
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:00,906
Take position!

111
00:07:04,244 --> 00:07:06,078
Will you fight your man
to conclusion?

112
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:08,713
Or drop defense
and allow for hollow victory,

113
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,815
as you did with me
before Titus?

114
00:07:10,883 --> 00:07:12,717
You are champion now.

115
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:14,620
Do not broach
fucking subject again.

116
00:07:15,822 --> 00:07:17,622
<i>Spill blood upon the sand,</i>

117
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,828
yet live to one day die with
glory and honor in the arena!

118
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,916
Begin!

119
00:08:11,712 --> 00:08:14,414
This is all that remains.

120
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:17,184
When the smoke clears
and the embers die.

121
00:08:18,854 --> 00:08:21,656
<i>The sum total of a man's life.</i>

122
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:30,864
This was my father's
last act before his death.

123
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,635
A bill of sale,
transferring your ownership.

124
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:38,304
The cause that moved you
to seek audience,

125
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:39,972
on the day I watched
my father burn?

126
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,274
Apologies, Dominus.

127
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:43,843
I could wait no longer.

128
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:45,845
To honor my father's wishes
sees you fall to control

129
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:47,547
of a man most hated.

130
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,383
To defy them sees
this house forever

131
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,884
excluded from the new arena.

132
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:53,187
A cock in the ass,
from either direction.

133
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:56,958
Speak, and give reason

134
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:59,160
to see this join
my father's ashes.

135
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:02,363
I have no words
towards such end.

136
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,798
I come to see
agreement honored.

137
00:09:06,836 --> 00:09:08,302
You wish to leave this house?

138
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,805
I wish to see blood.

139
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:12,573
See me delivered to
Tullius' care,

140
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:14,742
and I will see his life
for your father's.

141
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,548
My father never aimed
a favored word towards you.

142
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:24,151
Yet you entreat to be
the instrument of his vengeance?

143
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,456
Or is it another
you seek it for?

144
00:09:31,393 --> 00:09:32,527
You would sacrifice your life,

145
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:34,162
in the memory of hers?

146
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,634
I would sacrifice a thousand
if I had but had them.

147
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:40,636
If you had such
stirrings for Melitta,

148
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:43,472
why did you not fight harder
in the contest before my father?

149
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:46,408
You could have taken Crixus,
and remained here,

150
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:48,477
close to your heart's desires.

151
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,679
The match was lost
before sword was ever raised.

152
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:53,015
The same can be said
of your plan against Tullius.

153
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,217
He is forever surrounded
not only by his own men,

154
00:09:55,285 --> 00:09:57,253
but by good citizens who
would quickly come to the aid

155
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,921
of such a "noble" Roman.

156
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,723
Then they too shall fall.

157
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,191
You do not fucking think!

158
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:04,293
This grants ownership
to Tullius'

159
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:06,696
lap dog Vettius!

160
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:08,898
You would be sent to
the boy's ludus in fucking Nola.

161
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:10,567
A year could pass
before you find yourself

162
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:12,002
close enough to Tullius.

163
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,672
I would suffer a lifetime but to
have the chance to strike.

164
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,609
This house would be
the one that suffers!

165
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:20,278
A year of the greatest
gladiator in the Republic

166
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:22,314
fighting for those shits!

167
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,249
A year of you needing
to win each fight

168
00:10:24,317 --> 00:10:26,751
against my fucking men

169
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:31,589
in the hopes of gaining
an audience with Tullius.

170
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:34,192
Will he not wish to see the man
he has fought so hard to gain?

171
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,259
When so delivered?

172
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,161
Your desires are well noted.

173
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:40,131
I will weigh argument,

174
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:43,534
and come to an answer
in the balance.

175
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:46,904
Dominus.

176
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:54,412
Fetch more wine.

177
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:58,248
Vettius' appearance
was ill timed.

178
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:01,418
He is a dog,
untrained where not to shit.

179
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:04,322
The hand that grips his leash
is of greater concern.

180
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,424
Has Quintus voiced thought
towards Tullius?

181
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:09,160
He has not.

182
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:11,129
Yet what would any of us do,

183
00:11:11,197 --> 00:11:13,432
to see the death
of one so loved avenged?

184
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,668
The very heart of my concern.

185
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:18,137
To take action against Tullius

186
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:20,005
is to invite
mortal consequence.

187
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:21,841
He has made repeated
attacks against this house.

188
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:23,142
You would have us do nothing?

189
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,777
I would have you live.

190
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:28,648
If the situation with Tullius
turns to further disadvantage...

191
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:31,885
Know that you may always
seek refuge beneath my roof.

192
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:36,891
As a friend.

193
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,994
Where is the fucking wine?

194
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:40,362
Naevia brings more.

195
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:42,931
I should take my leave.

196
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:43,932
<i>No, stay.</i>

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,300
<i>I would have your counsel.</i>

198
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:48,569
Gannicus presses to honor
terms towards his sale.

199
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:49,970
Then the matter is resolved.

200
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:51,438
<i>Fuck resolution.</i>

201
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:53,707
The man only desires
close proximity to Tullius,

202
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:55,508
and the villain's throat
beneath his hands.

203
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:57,778
He would kill Tullius for us?

204
00:11:57,845 --> 00:11:59,313
Do you believe it possible?

205
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,180
You speak of madness!

206
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:03,917
<i>Tullius is far too cautious
to ever lower guard.</i>

207
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:05,285
Especially in
the presence of a man

208
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:07,387
loyal to the House of Batiatus.

209
00:12:07,455 --> 00:12:10,023
And what would brave Solonius
do in my fucking position?!

210
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:12,492
Turn blind eye towards
the murder of his father?!

211
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,862
He would be certain to strike
appropriate target.

212
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:18,132
What if Tullius
had no hand in this?

213
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,501
His gift of wine
was tainted with death.

214
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:22,203
But was it by Tullius' hand?

215
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:24,406
Or another moved
by equal grievance?

216
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:27,375
<i>What if Vettius
is the true cause of this?</i>

217
00:12:27,443 --> 00:12:29,211
The boy's hatred for you
is well known.

218
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:31,213
<i>You are right.</i>

219
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,582
Vengeance would stand
a hollow vessel...

220
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,717
were it not filled
with retribution

221
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,719
against all who have
injured this house.

222
00:12:36,787 --> 00:12:38,488
Including young Vettius.

223
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:39,689
You twist my intention!

224
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:41,191
He but straightens purpose.

225
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:43,493
Is this not what
set tragedy in motion?

226
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,495
Arrogance and impatience?

227
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:46,962
You are forever
reaching beyond grasp,

228
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,764
and dragging those
beside you as you fall.

229
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:50,199
And you have never
had the stomach

230
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:52,334
to do what it takes to make
a fucking name in this world!

231
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:54,469
<i>Good Solonius,
forever bowing and scraping</i>

232
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:56,371
in the shit of his betters.

233
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:58,140
Is it any wonder
no woman would have you?

234
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,177
Emotion carries us
beyond reason.

235
00:13:02,244 --> 00:13:04,246
Solonius has been
as a brother to us.

236
00:13:06,248 --> 00:13:08,984
It has been a trying day,
in a long succession of many.

237
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,319
Apologies.

238
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:13,255
I have asked much
of our friendship,

239
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:14,457
with little reward.

240
00:13:14,525 --> 00:13:17,561
Yet I must seek more,

241
00:13:17,628 --> 00:13:20,297
if we are to see injuries
against our house redressed.

242
00:13:24,135 --> 00:13:26,236
What are your thoughts?

243
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:28,938
They yet stand clouded.

244
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:30,006
Come, let us
put minds together,

245
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:31,441
and see them cleared.

246
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:55,466
<i>This mark carries great honor.</i>

247
00:13:57,168 --> 00:13:59,370
And even greater
responsibility.

248
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,107
Melitta held many years
as my body slave.

249
00:14:06,577 --> 00:14:09,545
And shall be missed
beyond the measure of words.

250
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:17,553
I expect equal loyalty
from you now.

251
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,955
You must always
to stand by my side,

252
00:14:20,023 --> 00:14:21,556
never to leave it.

253
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:23,125
Or this house.

254
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:24,693
As Diona chose.

255
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:28,063
<i>I understand why she fled.</i>

256
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,333
<i>It was an unfortunate thing,</i>

257
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:34,303
to be so used by men
for base entertainment.

258
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:36,006
I understand.

259
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:37,874
Yet cannot forgive.

260
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:41,178
Yes, Domina.

261
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,114
<i>What I can do...</i>

262
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,953
is make promise
that no one will ever

263
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,723
lay hands upon you for sport.

264
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,025
Your maidenhood will be
preserved as precious gift,

265
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:57,294
and given only
to the most worthy.

266
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:59,629
As Melitta was
given to Oenomaus.

267
00:15:09,005 --> 00:15:10,673
There.

268
00:15:12,175 --> 00:15:14,877
We are forever
bound to each other.

269
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:17,146
Bring oil
and a sharpened blade.

270
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:19,347
I would be rid
of this fucking beard.

271
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:20,482
Solonius?

272
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:22,650
His courage hardened,
and hands set to task.

273
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:24,719
Then you have come to decision.

274
00:15:24,787 --> 00:15:27,055
One that not even
good Tullius will see coming.

275
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:28,422
Gather my father's ashes.

276
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,959
And tell Oenomaus to prepare
Gannicus to leave these walls.

277
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:44,439
Batiatus again
spits in my face?

278
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:46,241
News absent surprise.

279
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:50,512
A snake by nature favors
maneuvering upon its belly.

280
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,847
I would stand upright.

281
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,215
Among honorable men.

282
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,886
Where does he take Gannicus?

283
00:15:57,954 --> 00:15:59,454
Batiatus sent me to secure sale

284
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:01,957
to the Syrian trader Galeagra.

285
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:03,758
By morning Gannicus
will be on a ship

286
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:05,993
sailing towards points unknown.

287
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:08,296
Forever beyond your reach.

288
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:10,999
You aided Batiatus in this?

289
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:14,135
I have known the man
for many years.

290
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:15,169
I was...

291
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:16,203
conflicted.

292
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:17,371
As am I.

293
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,742
On whether to strip flesh
from your fucking face.

294
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,744
Wait!

295
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:23,978
I came to you with this!

296
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:25,313
After the fact.

297
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:26,514
There is still time!

298
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:28,750
He meets the Syrian
at the edge of the city!

299
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:34,089
Gather the men.

300
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,560
I cannot believe
even Batiatus so thick,

301
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:41,129
to imagine concealing
such an act.

302
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:43,165
He will spin story...

303
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:45,101
of Gannicus escaping.

304
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:46,369
To perhaps follow
his slave Diona,

305
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:48,204
who recently went to foot.

306
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:51,674
He thinks me the fool,
to accept the tale?

307
00:16:51,742 --> 00:16:53,576
Batiatus knows you will
summon him to meeting.

308
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:55,178
To "discuss" the matter.

309
00:16:55,246 --> 00:16:57,681
He lays plans to see much coin
in your men's hands.

310
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:01,652
Payment in aid against your life
when he stands before you.

311
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,390
The fucking cock on him.

312
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,930
Batiatus has always thought
himself above those around him.

313
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,932
Even closest friend.

314
00:17:17,068 --> 00:17:19,671
I shall prove the notion false.

315
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,708
And see fucking son
join his father.

316
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:42,425
Where are they?

317
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:44,559
I will search ahead.

318
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:45,727
Stay where you are.

319
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:48,196
I would not
have you from my fucking side.

320
00:17:48,264 --> 00:17:49,531
If you had sold me to Tullius,

321
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,533
no one else's
life would be at risk.

322
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,601
With great risk
comes greater reward.

323
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:55,603
And I would have mine.

324
00:17:57,973 --> 00:17:59,506
The Syrians arrives.

325
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:10,885
I grow weary
of these games, Batiatus.

326
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:15,356
<i>And would see them
to bitter end.</i>

327
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:17,358
As would I.

328
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:33,009
Come.

329
00:18:33,077 --> 00:18:36,213
Let us embrace,
you fucking cunt.

330
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,485
(yells)

331
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,122
Fucking kill him Barca!

332
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:28,031
Fuck you!

333
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:29,132
You fucking shit!

334
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,700
You fuck!

335
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:45,982
Wait, hold!

336
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,517
Said hold!

337
00:19:53,223 --> 00:19:55,058
Such a death...

338
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,826
would be far too quick.

339
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,630
Bind him.

340
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:10,607
And you.

341
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:17,747
You played your part
to fucking perfection!

342
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,384
It was not difficult.

343
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:23,786
When passion for vengeance
overtakes caution,

344
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:26,489
even the keenest of minds
is easily deceived.

345
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:28,558
Modest to the fucking last.

346
00:20:28,626 --> 00:20:30,527
See these bodies put to grass.

347
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,228
Then get yourself
to the Medicus.

348
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:33,430
You are sure to your purpose?

349
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:35,098
My path has never been clearer.

350
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,603
Good Tullius.

351
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,340
Let us have final words.

352
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:46,577
Before you depart this life.

353
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:58,355
The lamb finally wakes.

354
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,091
Calm yourself.

355
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,026
I merely wish to break words.

356
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:06,929
Seek to raise alarm,

357
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,097
and find throat slit
well in advance of aid.

358
00:21:09,165 --> 00:21:10,733
We are clear?

359
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:18,440
You are fucking dead.

360
00:21:18,508 --> 00:21:19,708
Threats absent form,

361
00:21:19,776 --> 00:21:22,978
without Tullius
to support them.

362
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:24,412
What have you done to him?

363
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,947
Me?

364
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:27,282
I have done nothing.

365
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:28,917
<i>In all of this,</i>

366
00:21:28,985 --> 00:21:31,187
I have never known
quarrel with good Tullius.

367
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:32,922
Yet Batiatus...

368
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:34,891
he is of a contrary nature.

369
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,860
And moves even
as we speak to end

370
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,328
his conflict with your man.

371
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:40,197
Forever.

372
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,533
The opening of the arena
is upon us.

373
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,435
Tullius' absence will be noted.

374
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,904
And your part
in it quick upon heel.

375
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,606
You are mistaken.

376
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:51,509
No one will suspect
Tullius has left this world.

377
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,578
Not when trusted
Vettius heralds news

378
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,215
that he has unexpectedly
set sail abroad.

379
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:59,185
To attend pressing
matters in Antioch.

380
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:02,722
What would move tongue
to voice such fucking lie?

381
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,624
It more easily forms words
to see you and Batiatus

382
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,459
executed for your crimes.

383
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:10,296
Based upon what evidence?

384
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,931
We were not found
knife in hand,

385
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,399
kneeling beside body.

386
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,034
A body which even now Batiatus

387
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:18,136
conceals beyond
reach of human eyes.

388
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:21,706
No, my concern rests
with your safety.

389
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,777
Attempt to raise
unwarranted suspicion,

390
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,614
and Batiatus would
be sure to take offense.

391
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,950
And without Tullius
to protect you...

392
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,988
Ah.

393
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,656
Youth finally matures.

394
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,194
Now that we have settled issue,

395
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,963
let us turn to other matters.

396
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,598
Of a more personal nature...

397
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:53,139
<i>(Lucretia) All things change...</i>

398
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,840
<i>What we hold close
to our hearts</i>

399
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:56,709
eventually pass from this world.

400
00:22:58,779 --> 00:23:03,151
And what we once
turned from in disgust...

401
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:06,220
We embrace as necessity.

402
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:11,892
Raise your eyes.

403
00:23:15,797 --> 00:23:17,931
What do you see?

404
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:19,834
The Domina of this house.

405
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:20,968
Is that all?

406
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:24,204
I see a woman.

407
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:26,173
Unlike any I have seen before.

408
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:28,676
Better.

409
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:32,679
I did not think I pleased you.

410
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:34,715
When last called
to your chambers.

411
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:39,052
I love my husband,
beyond all men.

412
00:23:41,322 --> 00:23:43,690
I would do anything for him.

413
00:23:43,758 --> 00:23:45,959
And his legacy.

414
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:51,331
I do not need seek pleasure.

415
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:53,300
I need only your cock.

416
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:54,335
Speak of this,

417
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:56,203
and see it parted
from your body.

418
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:05,881
Yes, Domina.

419
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:09,684
Your hair and your beard

420
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:14,523
give the appearance
of a fucking animal.

421
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:18,494
I would have you reformed
into the semblance of a man.

422
00:24:18,561 --> 00:24:21,096
To make the lie I must
tell myself more convincing...

423
00:25:00,235 --> 00:25:02,136
A game well played, Batiatus.

424
00:25:03,372 --> 00:25:06,674
Now let us come to terms.

425
00:25:09,011 --> 00:25:12,346
<i>Your man Gannicus obviously
means a good deal to you,</i>

426
00:25:12,414 --> 00:25:15,317
to press to such extremes.

427
00:25:15,384 --> 00:25:17,986
I will cease my pursuit of him.

428
00:25:18,588 --> 00:25:20,489
Offer more.

429
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:21,591
I will see your house
take prominence

430
00:25:21,658 --> 00:25:23,359
in all upcoming games.

431
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:26,029
More.

432
00:25:26,096 --> 00:25:28,365
Speak desire,
and see it attended.

433
00:25:28,432 --> 00:25:30,900
I desire to see you suffer.

434
00:25:30,968 --> 00:25:33,370
As I have suffered
at your fucking hands.

435
00:25:33,438 --> 00:25:37,007
Your suffering
has only begun, lanista.

436
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:39,677
When it is discovered
what you have done to me!

437
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:41,445
You will not be discovered.

438
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:43,447
Nor missed.

439
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:45,082
Solonius moves young Vettius,

440
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,684
<i>towards offering
proper explanation</i>

441
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:48,252
<i>for your disappearance.</i>

442
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,053
Vettius?

443
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:52,389
The city will mourn.

444
00:25:52,457 --> 00:25:55,292
Soon your name will
be spoken of less and less.

445
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,595
Until it is lost to history.

446
00:25:58,663 --> 00:26:02,599
<i>I should have had your life
at the beginning of this.</i>

447
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,569
The mistake is mine,

448
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:09,739
having stayed hand
in respect of your father.

449
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:11,775
Respect?

450
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,719
Then pay it to the remains
of the man himself!

451
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:27,691
Tell him how high you hold him!

452
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,927
Even as your poisoned wine
robs him of fucking life!

453
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:31,928
Tell him!

454
00:26:31,996 --> 00:26:34,497
Tell him, you fucking shit!

455
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:38,435
Why should I strike
against your father?

456
00:26:39,203 --> 00:26:40,938
He was an honorable Roman.

457
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:45,442
A man who knew his place.

458
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:48,378
As I know yours.

459
00:26:48,446 --> 00:26:51,681
There will be an accounting,
Batiatus.

460
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:57,019
For this and everything
that follows.

461
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:01,056
The gods will
see to it some day.

462
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:04,325
But not this one.

463
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,140
This arena was your life.

464
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,476
Add to its foundation.

465
00:28:27,175 --> 00:28:30,010
<i>Have eyes ever beheld
such a sight?</i>

466
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:32,179
The laurel crown
of the Republic.

467
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:34,914
Its majesty even more evident
when viewed from the pulvinus.

468
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,950
A great honor,
to be invited by Tullius.

469
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:39,318
One I fear undeserved.

470
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:41,387
Yet he is a difficult
man to turn from.

471
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:44,423
A fact well known
to all present.

472
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:46,258
I am surprised by his delay.

473
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:47,526
The opening of the arena

474
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:49,528
<i>has been the only
subject on his tongue.</i>

475
00:28:49,596 --> 00:28:51,698
Now he stands late
to his own celebration.

476
00:28:59,074 --> 00:29:00,942
Apologies.

477
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:06,381
Tullius regrets
he will be absent altogether.

478
00:29:06,449 --> 00:29:08,783
What could wrest him
from so high a perch?

479
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,018
Pressing concerns
abroad in Antioch.

480
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:12,753
His departure was...

481
00:29:12,821 --> 00:29:14,955
unexpected.

482
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:17,023
<i>The arena would not exist
without Tullius.</i>

483
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:19,325
We would not be standing here,

484
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:21,060
were it not for his actions.

485
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:22,795
We should halt the celebrations
until his return.

486
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:23,795
Agreed.

487
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:24,963
I shall address the crowd...

488
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:27,132
<i>Tullius sends hard
instruction for ceremony</i>

489
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,834
to carry without him.

490
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,471
<i>This arena was a gift
to his beloved city.</i>

491
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:34,807
He would not see misfortune

492
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,576
to stand in the way
of the giving of it.

493
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:39,845
<i>A most gracious offer,
well received.</i>

494
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:41,514
Come.

495
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:42,982
Haunt Tullius'
place by my side,

496
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:45,050
possessing his spirit
for the occasion.

497
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:47,453
Again I must offer apology.

498
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:50,690
I make preparations
to follow Tullius to Antioch.

499
00:29:50,757 --> 00:29:51,691
What of your ventures here?

500
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:53,259
Your ludus?

501
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:57,296
I am retiring from
the lowly call of the lanista.

502
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,232
In favor of station more
befitting a man of breeding.

503
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,635
What will become of your men?

504
00:30:02,703 --> 00:30:04,170
They fight this very day.

505
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:06,974
I would not see your brief
labors turn to naught.

506
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,877
Solonius and I can make
fair offer to divide them.

507
00:30:09,945 --> 00:30:11,278
<i>Deeply appreciated.</i>

508
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:13,314
Yet unnecessary.

509
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:15,550
Solonius and I have
already come to terms.

510
00:30:15,618 --> 00:30:17,519
Terms?

511
00:30:17,587 --> 00:30:21,289
I have transferred deed to all
my gladiators to Solonius,

512
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:24,893
<i>under whose noble banner
they will fight this day.</i>

513
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:27,462
<i>You are indeed blessed,
Solonius.</i>

514
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,698
<i>Your ludus now stands above
all others in sheer numbers.</i>

515
00:30:30,766 --> 00:30:32,634
May the gods continue
to show favor.

516
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:36,405
<i>I must take my leave.</i>

517
00:30:36,472 --> 00:30:38,340
Give good Solonius
all consideration

518
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:40,776
towards future games.

519
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:42,744
Tullius and I would have it so.

520
00:30:44,947 --> 00:30:46,548
You are overly generous.

521
00:30:46,616 --> 00:30:48,483
Come. I would see you away.

522
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:54,523
The boy all but runs from us.

523
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:01,064
Vettius has always been
little more than Tullius' pet.

524
00:31:01,132 --> 00:31:02,733
<i>Is it any wonder
he runs to heel</i>

525
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,301
when leash is jerked?

526
00:31:05,136 --> 00:31:07,138
Batiatus speaks truth.

527
00:31:07,205 --> 00:31:09,106
Let us put absent
friends from mind,

528
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:11,775
and turn towards
the glories of the day.

529
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:20,616
You have done well.

530
00:31:20,684 --> 00:31:22,418
I but dance
to the yank of strings.

531
00:31:22,486 --> 00:31:24,686
Avoid them forming a noose,

532
00:31:24,754 --> 00:31:27,789
and never return to Capua
while I draw breath.

533
00:31:27,857 --> 00:31:29,958
I shall pray
for the day it ceases.

534
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:35,030
We were supposed to divide
Vettius' men among us.

535
00:31:35,098 --> 00:31:36,965
What the fuck are you doing?

536
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:39,468
What it takes to make
a name in this world.

537
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:42,638
After years of
"bowing and scraping in shit".

538
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:43,772
Is that what this is about?

539
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,041
A few words spoken
in anger absent thought?

540
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:47,943
A few words?

541
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:49,545
You name me friend and brother,

542
00:31:49,613 --> 00:31:53,116
yet at every turn remind
that I lack this trait or that.

543
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:54,551
You take information
given to aid

544
00:31:54,619 --> 00:31:56,220
and move against Tullius,

545
00:31:56,288 --> 00:31:59,490
absent regard of the difficult
position it places me.

546
00:31:59,558 --> 00:32:01,058
You talk of nothing.

547
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:04,128
Every tongue that is not
your own is accused of the same.

548
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:08,098
It has taken years
and the price of blood,

549
00:32:08,166 --> 00:32:10,967
but I at last see you
for what you are.

550
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:14,337
A man that holds no one
in esteem beyond himself.

551
00:32:14,405 --> 00:32:17,207
I owe you gratitude.

552
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:19,709
Without you to show the way,

553
00:32:19,777 --> 00:32:21,378
I would never have
raised nerve to betray

554
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:22,945
those closest to me.

555
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:38,196
What excuse does Solonius give?

556
00:32:38,263 --> 00:32:40,699
None that merit consideration.

557
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:46,972
<i>What has the crowd
in such a state?</i>

558
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,707
Sextus announces executions
before the games begin.

559
00:32:59,116 --> 00:33:01,484
(crowd yelling)

560
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:13,497
Is that not one of yours,
Batiatus?

561
00:33:13,565 --> 00:33:16,501
The girl on the end,
what was her name...

562
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:22,541
Diona.

563
00:33:27,948 --> 00:33:31,249
Diona, yes.

564
00:33:31,317 --> 00:33:32,917
Apologies, Batiatus.

565
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:35,386
The girl was only
rounded up this morning.

566
00:33:35,454 --> 00:33:37,588
If you wish her removed
to be dealt with personally...

567
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:41,357
No.

568
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,159
<i>Let her death stand as warning.</i>

569
00:33:43,227 --> 00:33:45,661
To all others who would
seek to betray me.

570
00:33:57,675 --> 00:34:00,477
Caburus is your man now,
Solonius.

571
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:02,979
Rise, and see him to purpose.

572
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:04,647
As you wish.

573
00:35:34,872 --> 00:35:40,008
A pity,
to lose one so fetching.

574
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:42,711
Soon you join. Cunt.

575
00:35:45,047 --> 00:35:46,814
Doctore.

576
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,551
I can fight.

577
00:35:51,386 --> 00:35:52,687
Have word with dominus

578
00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:57,058
I already have.

579
00:35:57,126 --> 00:35:59,694
Aid your brothers in
preparing for the day.

580
00:35:59,762 --> 00:36:02,497
You will fight again
when you are able.

581
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:04,332
Yes, Doctore.

582
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,709
You will face
Tasgetius and Synetos.

583
00:36:13,777 --> 00:36:15,111
In the match before the primus.

584
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:20,017
<i>Our days have been filled.</i>

585
00:36:20,085 --> 00:36:23,721
Show all of Capua why you are
considered such a prize.

586
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:24,988
Fight.

587
00:36:25,056 --> 00:36:27,057
And honor
the House of Batiatus.

588
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:30,027
There are many things
I would die for.

589
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:32,196
<i>Many I deserve to die for.</i>

590

This house is
no longer among them.

591
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:38,135
Then fight for her.

592
00:36:40,404 --> 00:36:42,105
Every life you take.

593
00:36:42,173 --> 00:36:44,006
The blood you shed.

594
00:36:44,074 --> 00:36:45,842
She will see it
from the afterlife.

595
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:52,883
Then I shall fill her eyes.

596

Yet this arena towers above
all others in the republic.

656
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,699
<i>It is a vast beast.</i>

657
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:17,768
<i>And it yet hungers!</i>

658
00:44:20,472 --> 00:44:23,508
<i>Two great houses
face each other.</i>

659
00:44:23,575 --> 00:44:25,577
<i>Yet every man
must ultimately stand</i>

660
00:44:25,644 --> 00:44:29,079
<i>for himself and himself alone.</i>

661
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:44,059
What are they doing?

662
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:45,260
It matters not.

663
00:44:48,964 --> 00:44:52,200
<i>Fire burns
within their breasts.</i>

664
00:44:52,268 --> 00:44:56,071
<i>And it is fire that shall
bind them in final contest!</i>

665
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,588
<i>Fall to the sands
beyond the flames,</i>

666
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:17,091
<i>and find yourself
removed from the primus.</i>

667
00:45:17,158 --> 00:45:21,495
<i>Fall within them,
and be removed from this world.</i>

668
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:23,463
<i>Take position!</i>

669
00:45:46,423 --> 00:45:48,257
Do not die before we meet.

670
00:45:52,262 --> 00:45:55,831
<i>Split heaven with
the sound of your fury!</i>

671
00:46:03,707 --> 00:46:05,174
Begin!

672
00:46:43,381 --> 00:46:44,814
First blood to Solonius!

673
00:47:00,065 --> 00:47:01,699
Yeah!

674
00:47:46,044 --> 00:47:47,378
Yes!

675
00:48:07,533 --> 00:48:08,733
Yes!

676
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:09,901
It is a pity you did not land

677
00:48:09,969 --> 00:48:12,503
more men
in the primus, Solonius.

678
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:14,672
I fear you may be
eliminated prematurely.

679
00:48:25,783 --> 00:48:27,217
You crazy fuck.

680
00:48:32,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Batiatus' men think
so little of his house,

681
00:48:33,859 --> 00:48:35,793
<i>they seek to kill each other.</i>

682
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:06,757
Who stands now?

683
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:34,887
(screaming)

684
00:49:52,105 --> 00:49:53,339
Capua!

685
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:57,309
Fuck!

686
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,437
Let us press advantage, brother!

687
00:50:26,505 --> 00:50:28,639
<i>Kill Gannicus!</i>

688
00:50:28,707 --> 00:50:31,142
Then decide who
is champion between us!

689
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:34,479
No!

690
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:41,587
Your men again
set upon each other

691
00:50:41,655 --> 00:50:43,256
before common foe is defeated.

692
00:50:43,323 --> 00:50:45,925
To be expected, when animals
are not properly trained.

693
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:49,562
Gannicus is mine!

694
00:51:24,265 --> 00:51:26,333
It appears odds have shifted.

695
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:50,690
The odds return to balance.

696
00:53:59,623 --> 00:54:01,624
Yes!

697
00:54:22,781 --> 00:54:26,685
The House of Batiatus
stands fucking triumphant!

698
00:54:27,853 --> 00:54:29,287
Apologies.

699
00:54:29,355 --> 00:54:31,323
(laughs)
None required.

700
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:33,358
A most impressive showing.

701
00:54:33,425 --> 00:54:35,160
I do but honor this city.

702
00:54:35,227 --> 00:54:37,662
And my champion
continues to do the same.

703
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:40,198
I have mind towards
your man for my own games.

704
00:54:40,265 --> 00:54:41,865
<i>As do I.</i>

705
00:54:41,933 --> 00:54:44,301
Listen how he
ignites the crowd.

706
00:54:48,973 --> 00:54:51,341
(crowd chanting)
Gannicus!

707
00:54:57,115 --> 00:54:59,082
Would they not forever
remember this day,

708
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:00,984
and the men
responsible for it...

709
00:55:01,052 --> 00:55:04,054
if Gannicus
were granted freedom?

710
00:55:04,122 --> 00:55:06,356
Freedom?

711
00:55:06,424 --> 00:55:08,225
I would have granted the same
in deference to the crowd.

712
00:55:08,293 --> 00:55:09,226
<i>Had my man survived.</i>

713
00:55:09,294 --> 00:55:12,230
An excellent suggestion.

714
00:55:12,298 --> 00:55:13,932
You can always train
another gladiator.

715
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:16,635
<i>Yet to conclude
the opening ceremonies</i>

716
00:55:16,703 --> 00:55:18,805
with such a blessing...

717
00:55:18,872 --> 00:55:20,340
As I said.

718
00:55:20,407 --> 00:55:22,175
I but honor this city.

719
00:55:35,021 --> 00:55:38,157
Gannicus has proven himself
to the city of Capua!

720
00:55:39,526 --> 00:55:41,660
Let him be rewarded...

721
00:55:42,695 --> 00:55:44,495
With freedom!

722
00:55:52,205 --> 00:55:55,174
(crowd chanting)
Gannicus!

723
00:56:08,256 --> 00:56:10,490
(chanting)
Gannicus!

724
00:56:19,733 --> 00:56:21,400
(cheering)

725
00:56:22,903 --> 00:56:23,869
After all we have suffered.

726
00:56:23,937 --> 00:56:25,604
Gannicus is still lost to us.

727
00:56:26,272 --> 00:56:28,040
I offered the man coin.

728
00:56:28,107 --> 00:56:29,608
Freedom to come
and go as he pleases.

729
00:56:29,676 --> 00:56:30,843
If he would yet
fight for our house.

730
00:56:33,747 --> 00:56:35,447
Memories haunt the man.

731
00:56:36,616 --> 00:56:38,484
<i>Drive him from our walls.</i>

732
00:56:40,687 --> 00:56:43,155
Crixus afforded himself
well in the games.

733
00:56:44,658 --> 00:56:47,159
Let us turn
our hope towards him,

734
00:56:47,227 --> 00:56:50,628
<i>that he may bring us honor
and good fortune.</i>

735
00:56:55,768 --> 00:56:57,835
Yes.

736
00:56:57,903 --> 00:57:00,471
Let us place stock in the Gaul.

737
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:03,006
And see what ends
he may service.

738
00:57:03,074 --> 00:57:04,941
Real proud of you brother.

739
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,183
I shall join you one day,
you mad fuck.

740
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:15,153
Of that there is no doubt.

741
00:57:28,267 --> 00:57:31,269
We have not yet
had proper contest.

742
00:57:31,337 --> 00:57:34,272
Win your own freedom,
and seek me out.

743
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:42,914
Crixus.

744
00:57:45,652 --> 00:57:46,652
I was given this when I became

745
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:48,553
champion of this house.

746
00:57:55,796 --> 00:57:57,897
Wear it with more honor
than I have.

747
00:58:29,564 --> 00:58:31,931
You have earned the rudis.

748
00:58:31,999 --> 00:58:34,868
Proof you no longer
stand a slave.

749
00:58:44,178 --> 00:58:45,946
A lifetime of blood.

750
00:58:46,014 --> 00:58:47,715
And victory.

751
00:58:47,783 --> 00:58:49,117
It lifts troubled heart,

752
00:58:49,184 --> 00:58:51,052
to see my brother
gain his freedom.

753
00:58:52,053 --> 00:58:53,888
Melitta would have been proud.

754
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,663
Oenomaus...

755
00:59:04,134 --> 00:59:05,768
She loved you.

756
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,671
Above all others.

757
00:59:11,641 --> 00:59:14,343
The thought shall keep me warm.

758
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:17,246
Until I join her
in the afterlife.

759
00:59:17,314 --> 00:59:19,181
I shall meet you both there.

760

♪

761
01:00:26,687 --> 01:00:28,421
Doctore.

762
01:00:30,191 --> 01:00:31,757
Begin the day's training.

763
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:43,968
<i>First position!</i>

764
01:00:52,712 --> 01:00:54,079
I would not hear
the name Gannicus

765
01:00:54,147 --> 01:00:56,215
spoken within these walls.

766
01:00:56,283 --> 01:00:59,285
Nor that of Tullius
or his cock eating apprentice.

767
01:00:59,353 --> 01:01:01,755
These things are of the past.

768
01:01:04,392 --> 01:01:06,160
Let us look towards
brighter future.

769

My eyes are firmly fixed.

770
01:01:16,872 --> 01:01:19,808
We will see this house elevated.

771
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,409
Beyond my father.

772
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:22,477
Beyond Solonius.

773
01:01:22,544 --> 01:01:25,346
Beyond the fucking gods
themselves.

774
01:01:25,414 --> 01:01:28,583
We will leave
our mark upon this city.

775
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:31,185
And one day,

776
01:01:31,253 --> 01:01:34,322
see proper reward
for all we have done.
