1
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,440
MORTDECAI:
As you may well know, I am many things.

2
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,500
An arts dealer, an accomplished fencer,

3
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,140
fair shot with most weapons.

4
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,823
I am loved and respected
by all who know me...

5
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,585
Slightly.

6
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,660
But I have always felt

7
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,900
there's something missing, you see.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,300
Some final piece of my personal puzzle.

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,900
I needed something bold, distinctive.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,300
Ah, thank you.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,060
The work of art with which

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,580
I could declare to the heavens,

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,700
I am Lord Charlie Mortdecai,

14
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,189
and this little bit of magic

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,708
is my mustache.

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,900
I see.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,706
Shall we to business then, Fang?

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,909
Would you mind?

19
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,429
"Find," you said.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,910
Mmm, and find, I have done.

21
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,381
The Qianlong vase.

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,180
Very, very rare.

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,269
Low-fired with an immersion glaze?

24
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,300
None of the southern

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,900
Yangtze ceramics are low-fired.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,700
But you know that. You're testing me.

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,900
(GROANS)

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,380
I'm so terribly sorry. Mosquito.
You see it?

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,580
(MORTDECAI CHUCKLES)

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,900
Why don't you test the vase instead?

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,460
I am sure that you will agree

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,900
it is a bargain at two million pounds.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,829
Everyone knows you're broke.

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,341
You will take one million.

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,980
Ooh.

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,786
Golly, that was a big one! (CHUCKLES)

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,142
Well, have it your way, Fang.

38
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,310
One million pounds.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,866
I trust that you have, um,
brought the treasuries?

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,549
I think I'll keep the money.

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,021
And the vase.

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,500
(MUMBLES)

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,660
You cheated me in our last deal.

44
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,021
(STAMMERING)

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,230
I paid three million for that tapestry,

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,784
then found out it is worth only one!

47
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,140
(GRUNTS)

48
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,620
(CHUCKLES)

49
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,791
You took from me.
Now I will take from you.

50
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,180
Now, you look here, Fang! Fat. Fang Fat.

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,140
I'm an art dealer, not a charlatan.

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,780
A rogue, perhaps, a scamp

53
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,260
or scoundrel, I will grant you.

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,020
But never an outright mountebank.

55
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,221
Enough!

56
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,506
You owe me.

57
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,780
I believe a finger would be fair.
Don't you?

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,186
No!

59
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,661
Oh!

60
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,901
Jock!

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,107
I wouldn't, mate. I really wouldn't.

62
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,427
(MORTDECAI YELPS)

63
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,060
Jockie, thank heavens!
Where have you been, man?

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,103
Right behind you as always, sir.

65

00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,864
Well done, Jockie.

(GRUNTING)

77
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,780
Well, I think our work here is done.

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,505
- Time to go, sir.
- Ah.

79
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,265
(SIRENS WAILING)

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,300
MORTDECAI: Jock laid out
the state of our financial affairs.

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,821
Basically, they involved debt.

82
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,108
Massive, crushing debt.

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,780
We hurried back to Mortdecai Manor,
where my beloved wife, Johanna,

84
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,420
having heard of our financial distress,

85
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,740
was arriving home

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,307
to sell off some
of my prized possessions.

87
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,581
Even my horsey picture was on the block.

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,900
But I was hopeful my new moustache

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,220
would cheer her up.

90
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,546
JOHANNA: Darling!

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,340
Oh, God, I missed you terribly.

92
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,140
MORTDECAI: Johanna. Love of my life.

93
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,740
Apple of my eye.

94
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,820
I so wish you had been there.

95

(SIGHS)

96
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,420
Can you imagine the two of us

97
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,020
in that frigid city,

98
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,660
only our passions keeping us...

99
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,386
Whoa! (LAUGHING) What is that?

100
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,100
Just a little something I cooked up

101
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,711
whilst you were away, my darling.

102
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,180
I do believe it was Maggie Thatcher
who said that kissing a man without

103
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,546
a moustache is rather like
eating an egg without salt.

104
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,700
Oh, don't point that thing at me.

105
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,881
Told ya.

106
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,340
I have put no inconsiderable thought

107
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,340
and effort into this endeavor.

108
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,540
You see, the domain of a man's upper lip

109
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,860
is his sovereign ground...

110
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,460
You have five minutes to shave it off.

111
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,063
Every Mortdecai man before me
had the same. Why can't I?

112
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,700
Oh, I happen to be terribly fond of it,

113
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,667
and I have had every intention
of seeing it through.

114
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,190
You mean it's going to get bigger?

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,021
It will come to fruition, yes.

116

Oh...

120
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,580
I can't, my duck. Not at this juncture.

121
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,431
It's not even fully corked. It's a baby.

122
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,382
- Jock?
- Yes, madam?

123

Please, will you make up

124
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,740
the guest bedroom for Mr. Mortdecai?

125
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,380
Already have, madam.

126
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,500
And I shan't be having dinner
downstairs this evening.

127
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,580
I'll just have a supper tray in my room.

Very good, madam.

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,740
I do believe Jock has informed you

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,420
that we are staring down
the barrel of insolvency.

132
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,340
What do you plan to do about it?

133
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,986
Right. Yes, well...

134
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,066
That... Well... Quite.

135
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,951
First thing we're doing
is selling off that Sheridan.

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,780
Oh, my sweet little love beast,

138
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,940
I am sure that we will
come up with the necessary funds

139
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,940
by the end of the month.
What is today, the fifth!

140
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,300
The 26th, sir.

141
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,700
All right. That gives us six...

142
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,780
Four days, sir.

143
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,420
Jock? Please can you take the Sheridan

144
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,780
up to London in the morning?

145
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,780
I'm entering it
in the Autumn Masters Auction.

Right you are, madam.

Come, come. Let's not be rash.

JOHANNA: Oh, hello, Poppet.

149
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,980
We cannot go about selling off
family heirlooms willy-nilly.

150
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,420
I'm afraid I shall have to
put my foot down, darling.

152

She'll come around, Jock.
How could she not?

She's only human, sir.

MORTDECAI: A quick aside about Jock.

159
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,431
In addition to being
my manservant and thug,

160
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,300
he also maintains an enviable rate

161
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,150
of sexual intercourse,

162
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,180
which can be occasionally problematic.

163
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,340
Recently, after we'd concluded
the sale of a painting

164
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,383
to a wealthy turkey farmer...

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,020
(GUNSHOT)

166
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,301
What was that?

167
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,500
Get your head down, sir.

168
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,340

00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,501
MORTDECAI: Martland
also met Johanna at school.

334
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,260
After a three-year courtship,
he finally worked up the courage

335
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,542
to express his feelings to her.

336
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,224
In verse.

337
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,030
- Johanna, do you...
- Oh!

338
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,383
MORTDECAI: Rotten timing for him.

339
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,190
- Hello! (CHUCKLES)
- Martland.

340
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,867
Would you mind terribly,
dear boy, the door?

341
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,700
Course, I'll just, uh...
I'll shut the door.

342
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,902
Now, what's all this
about a missing Goya?

343
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,820
Oh, it's the house. Terribly vast.

344
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,300
Echo-ey, don't you know?

345
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,740
(CHUCKLES)

346
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,380
Well, that's classified information,
I'm afraid.

347
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,060
You know, state secrets
and what have you.

348
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,220
Mmm.

349
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,500
My husband is trying
to reclaim his youth

350
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,220
by growing that horrible moustache.

351
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,741
Do inform him that that ship has sailed.

352
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,140
Every Mortdecai man
before me has had one.

353
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,300
And I will have you know
that some members

354
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,026
of the fairer sex
do find it quite appealing.

355
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,669
Whom exactly?

356
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,865
(SCOFFS)

357
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,380
No one in particular, of course.

358
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,180
Metaphoric woman... Women.

359
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,704
Metaphorically... General... You know.

360
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,540
If you are growing
that excrement on your lip

361
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,105
to please another, know this:

362
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,747
I will kill her.

363
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,786
Oh, Alastair. It's so lovely.
Do come back.

364
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,340
It's so wonderful to have someone

365
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,700
of reasonable intelligence
to converse with.

366
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,265
I'd be delighted.

367
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,862
Do I detect a slight crack
in the marital armor?

368
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,220
A mere tiff, old bean. Nothing more.

369
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,468
Oh, really? Seems like
more than a tiff to me.

370
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,108
My wife needs to come around
to a certain viewpoint. That is all.

371
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,745
Well, good luck, mate.

372
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,260
See what you can dig up about that Goya.
Usual channels.

373
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,460
We'll meet in London tomorrow.

374
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,661
Of course.

375
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,100
EMIL: I had the painting in my hand.

376
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,109
Someone must have known I was coming.

377
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,900
Milton Krampf? The American?

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,460
Well, it must have been his dealer.

379
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,991
(SIREN WAILING IN THE DISTANCE)

380
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,029
Krampf's dealer, what is his name?

381
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,630
Mortdecai.

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,820
MORTDECAI: Johanna, my darling.

My... My love. My...

385
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,980
My only true love. My love beast.

386
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,865
My rumpus room rascal. (INHALES)

387
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,660
Ooh, you have no idea

388
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,988
the beast you are about to receive.

389
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,986
Mmm...

390
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,986
Johanna?

391
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,149
Are you all right in there, darling?

392
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,860
It is I, Charlie. Your husband.

Oh, moon of my delight.
This is your own personalized

admission into your tent.

I have come to carry you off
to the burning desert,

My Sheik, does this mean
you have excommunicated

403
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,065
that moustache of the Prophet?

404
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,140
I'll trim it.

(SIGHS)

406
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,661
Darling,

407
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,868
I am embarking
on a very dangerous escapade

408
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,671
from which I may not well return.

409
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,020
And it is customary in these situations

410
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,585
for, you know,

411
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,267
a proper send-off.

412
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,580
Quick session of congress.

413
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,110
Sink the Bismarck, if you will.

414
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,789
And by the way, did I mention

415
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,110
it is a matter of national security.

416
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,101
Mmm.

417
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,860
It's very difficult for me
as well, you know,

418
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,789
this thing that's come between us.

419
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,304
I know, darling.

420
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,540
- Mmm.
- No, no. Steady yourself.

I beg you, darling, please.

You know I have
a sympathetic gag reflex.

424
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,460
Oh, God. (SWALLOWS) It's unbearable.

425
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,471
You will get used to it. I promise.
Why should I have to?

426
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,430
I'm invested in it.

427
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,504
Why can't you invest
in saving us from financial ruin?

428
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,662
Or do you want me
to sort it out for you?

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,142
Heavens, no. You needn't worry yourself.

430
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,945
I have things firmly in hand.

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,780
No, no, no, no.

497
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,701
Just getting rid of some choice items
while the market's right.

498
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,820
What do you make of
this Bronwen business, eh?

499
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,420
Huh. Ghastly affair.

500
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,146
One always bemoans
the loss of a great restorer.

501
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,144
Old bag.
She should have put locks on her doors.

502
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,224
You used her frequently, didn't you?

503
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,940
Not lately.

504
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,222
She's been unavailable for three months.

505
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,903
The Goya she was cleaning.

506
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,909
Rather simple job, wouldn't you say?

507
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,301
Usual dirt and grime
one finds on the Spaniards.

508
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,908
Haven't the foggiest
why it took her so long.

509
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,345
What's your sudden interest,
if I may ask?

510
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,380
A client with a mild curiosity,
that's all.

511
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,741
Oh.

512
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,666
Mmm...

513
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,587
We must go shooting again.
Jock has fully recovered.

514
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,420
Ooh.

515
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,180
There's only one reason

516
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,509
you might be interested
in a museum-owned Goya,

517
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,585
and that's because
there's money involved.

518
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,944
You are mistaken, sir.

519
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,350
There's a great deal of money involved.

520
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,031
(LAUGHING)

521
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,624
I've always admired your rapacity, sir.

522
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,700
I say, Sir Graham, I wonder,

523
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,631
your, mmm, protrusion...

524
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,740
Might it be
possible to swing the old fellow north,

525
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,066
as it were?

526
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,471
(INHALES SHARPLY)

527
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,791
Who's the client?

528
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,703
Terribly sorry, sworn to secrecy.

529
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,540
(EXHALES)

530
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,260
Perhaps a brisk walk down the stairs

531
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,225
will do some good. Yes.

532
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,751
So it's that sort of Goya.

533
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,060
ON PHONE: Romanov.

534
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,261
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

535
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,666
That painted lady
you've been searching for,

536
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,505
I believe she may be in play.

537
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,665
I want that painting.

538
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,501
MARTLAND: Johanna!

539
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,106
Alastair.

540
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,105
So glad you called.

541
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,470
I've asked for a Chardonnay.
That is your drink, isn't it?

542
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,510
- Oh, you remembered.
- Mmm.

543
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,420
Thank you. (CLEARS THROAT)

544
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,460
Oh, God. How thoughtless of me.

545
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,946
You're on duty.

546
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,866
And in charge, thank you very much.

547
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,300
Mmm.

548
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,260
To what do I owe the pleasure?

549
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,660
I was just in the neighborhood
and thought I'd pop 'round,

550
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,140
and see how
you secret agent men run the world.

551
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,140
(CHUCKLES) Not nearly.

552
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,660
Although it is terribly vital work.

553
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,830
It's not all chardonnay
and afternoon trysts.

554
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,541
Is this a tryst?

555
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,386
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

556
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,702
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

557
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,227
- No, I was just, um...
- Of course you were.

558
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,221
How are things at home?

(INHALES)

560
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,700
You've touched a nerve.

561
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,340
You've sensed it, Alastair.

562
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,224
You always were the sensitive one.

563
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,660
- You've got a difficult chap.
- Beastly.

564
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,140
Bit of a moron, actually.

565
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,183
Maybe I should have an affair.
(CHUCKLES)

566
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,543
- Wouldn't that be funny?
- Hilarious.

567
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,460
Do you think I could keep it a secret?

568
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,822
- Yes!
- Well then, what's the point?

569
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,940
Now, tell me,
what are you and my husband

570
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,426
working on at the moment?

571
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,820
Oh, uh... Well, in vague terms

572
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,700
there's a very bad man who wants
what I want, and I'm trying to stop him.

573
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,060
And what does a missing Goya

574
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,581
have to do with national security?

575
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,181
In vague terms.

576
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,460
- Johanna...
- (GASPS)

577
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,340
You think poor
Miss Fellworthy stumbled into something,

578
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,110
and that's why she got killed.

579
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,025
I really can't say.

580
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,263
Oh, this is interesting.

581
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,060
Creates quite a market when a painting
with a little mystery goes missing.

582
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,300
So much to do.

583
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,740
What was the name of
Bronwen's college at Oxford?

584
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,625
Johanna, I simply can't.

585
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,270
Right. Sorry.

586
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,420
Oh, golly. Look at the time.
I really must be going.

587
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,580
Oh.

588
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,900
It was lovely to see you, Alastair.

589
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,546
Thank you ever-so-much
for letting me confide in you.

590
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,102
I feel that I could share
anything with you.

591
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:36,706
Don't you feel the same?
That you could share with me?

592
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,391
Bronwen's college?

593
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,780
You're rather monstrous.

594
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,106
Of course you're aware of that.

595
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,146
- Blackfriar's Hall.
- We must do this again.

the finest garage man

599
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,991
in Western Civilization,

600
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,902
Spinoza was the best
art smuggler in the business,

601
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,986
and the eyes and ears
of the art world's underbelly.

Ah! Hello, Spinoza, you handsome devil!

It's a fine day to be alive, what?

You bloody chicken, bloody monkey,

605
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,620
so good-for-nothing pot of piss, innit?

Spinoza, you silver-tongued scallywag.

607
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,300
What's the matter with you, eh?

608
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,460
You one book short of a library,
you maggot? Eh?

You one megabyte short of a RAM?

MORTDECAI: The rest was a bit rude,
so I won't quote him verbatim.

611
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,420
But what vexed him so was a matter
of some overdue bills on the Rolls,

612
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,500
which I had now asked him to package

613
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,146
and ship off to America on credit.

Right.

Uh, Spinoza,
I did not come here to discuss

617
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,820
my relationship with my mother, uh,

618
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,829
nor my relationship to your mother.

619
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,340
Uh, no. We have two items of business.

620
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,620
Item one: The Rolls-Royce,

621
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,820
which I have reluctantly agreed to sell

622
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,785
to that thick-fingered American, Krampf.

623
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,300
Item the second: I need to ascertain

624
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,620
whether any unsavory types
have enlisted you

625
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,346
to smuggle a painting
out of the country recently.

626
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,223
And for your information,
I am holding up

627
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,187
a 50-pound note.

628
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,540
Never mind about that.

629
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,823
You should treat a jam jar car like this

630
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,460
with more respect when you drive it

631

The Duchess of Wellington.

822
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,424
Bronwen has found the lost Goya.

823
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,820
Goya was commissioned
by Charles IV of Spain

824
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,909
to paint her in 1792.

825
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,108
Uh, she was said to be
his greatest masterpiece.

826
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,986
Unfortunately,

827
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:53,461
she was also
said to have been the King's mistress.

828
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,429
The Queen was unamused.

829
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,909
Humiliated, she ordered
the painting to be burned.

830
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,420
But instead it was stolen
and secreted away.

831
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,660
(HORSE NEIGHING)

832
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,546
Some say that Goya himself
engineered the theft.

833
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:14,300
For 200 years, the painting
was sought by collectors,

834
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,900
craved by the mighty,

835
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,228
and became the stuff of legend.

836
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,860
And is the legend true?

837
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,220
Does it matter?

838
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,264
The truth is nice,
but a rumor is priceless.

839
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,140
What does Strago want with it?
If it does exist, it belongs to Spain.

840
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,461
If anyone tried to sell it,
they'd be arrested on the spot.

841
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,346
Yes, well, that is where the story
gets interesting, you see.

842
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,748
The Duchess pops up again
in France in 1943,

843
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,460
looted from some sealed room

844
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,470
in an unpronounceable chateau
by the jerrys.

845
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,860
Hermann Goering was said to have been

846
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,141
obsessed with the painting,

847
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,624
and there are rumors
that he inscribed on it

848
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,871
the codes to his numbered
Swiss bank account.

849
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,543
Untold riches and all that, what?

850
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,067
But

851
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,865
when the allies captured Goering...

852
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,387
Out of the way, out of the way.

853
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,510
...there was no mention of the painting.

854
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,464
It had vanished once again into history,

855
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,420
and the secret bank accounts
along with it.

856
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,780
What are we talking about here?

857
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,620
Hundreds and hundreds of millions,

858
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,901
surrounded by all that

859
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,060
Gruyere, chocolate, and fine wines.

860
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,700
Well, that's what Emil's after.

861
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,820
The fine wine?

862
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,700
No, the fortune to fund
violent worldwide revolution.

863
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,780
Right!

864
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,660
Multiple attacks over the years to come,

865
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,100
countless lives are at stake.

866
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,100
That painting should be destroyed.

867
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,620
Yeah. Fingers crossed, chaps,
you find it first.

868
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,867
I'm off for a wee.

869
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,981
Ah...

870
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,460

I'm deeply, deeply flattered, young man.

877
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,020
However, I myself do not swing that...

878
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,302
Oh, Golly! I have read about this.

879
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,461
Ohh.

880
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,064
I sunk into an uneasy slumber,

881
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,910
interspersed curiously
with erotic dreams.

882
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,028
Lady Mortdecai,
the Duke is expecting you.

883
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,021
This way.

884

(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV)

885
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,946
Her Lady Mortdecai to see you,

886
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,425
The Duke of Asherboroughdon.

You'll forgive me
just a moment, I'm sure?

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,791
- Of course.

Who is this woman Mortdecai
and what does she want? Hmm?

895
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,100
Well, I don't know. I don't know.

896
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,426
Why wasn't I told?

897
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,342
She's so damned attractive.

with Bronwen Fellworthy.

- Bunny has it.
- I beg your pardon?

During the War. Nazi bastards.

Bunny rolled it up
in a carpet and didn't tell a soul.

"Charlie, where could it be?"

However...

1642
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,828
I do have the slightest of queries.

What do we do next?

1644

Hmm.

1645
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,220
Because if Martland should get
his grubby hands on that painting,

1646
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,420
he would destroy
a magnificent work of art.

1647
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,940
And we will be out a finder's fee.

1648
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,940
If it falls into Strago's hands,

1649
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,500
he will unleash his unpleasantness

1650
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,668
to disastrous effect upon the world.

1651
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,140
And if we try to sell it to Romanov,

1652
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,660
he will kill us
and simply take it instead.

1653
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,460
And yet we must find a way to pay

1654
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,628
eight million in back taxes.

1655
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:26,660
Mmm. Quite, quite, yes, indeed, quite.

1656
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:28,500
Quite a conundrum, this.

1657
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,860
I shall need a moment
to think this through, I'm afraid.

1658
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,100
Yes, do. Do think.

1659
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,940
Just bear in mind,
I'm standing on a loo,

1660
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,505

1661

in Sedgwick's Friday auction,

1662
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,347

1663
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:42,867
Yes.

1664

Perfect.

1665

We are going to
enter the Goya into the auction,

1666

1667
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,700
But it's already at Sedgwick's.

1668

It's been authenticated.

1669
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,911
We'll make a switch.

1670
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,140
But first we must convince our buyers

1671
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,751
that the Goya's back in play.

1672
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,660
They won't take our word for it.

1673
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,340
They'll want to see it themselves.

1674
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,030
Then we'll show it to them.

to move it on the open market.

1688

1689
