00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:15,262
because we had a little debate
on the conference call
with New York about you.

155
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,428
You... About me?
You were talking about me?

156
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,101
We were wondering
aloud to one another

157
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,110
whether or not you would
be good for on camera.

158
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,941
What'd you decide?

159
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,983
They... They decided
that they like you,

160
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,453
and they would like
to put you on camera.

161
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,490
Really?
I know.
I was so surprised, too.

162
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,186
Oh, my God.
This is the best news ever.
Thank you so much.

163
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,819
This is great!
Congratulations.

164
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,660
Thank you.
I'll take that smile
as a "Yes, I'll do it."

165
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,996
Absolutely. I'm so excited!
Oh, my God.

166
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,468
It's a lot of work. Can't wait
to see what happens.

167
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,869
It's gonna be tough.
Tough job.

168
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,736
About the work,
most immediately,

169
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,072
there's gonna be
some things that you're
gonna be able to get...

170
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,407
ALLlSON: Okay.
...that other people
in the office don't get.

171
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,378
One of them, gym membership.

172
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,676
You want me to lose weight?

173
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,380
(LAUGHlNG) No, I don't
want you to lose weight.

174
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,852
No. We can't legally
ask you to do that.

175
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:12,254
We didn't say lose weight.
I might say tighten.

176
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,484
Tight.

177
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,585
A little tighter?

178
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,596
Just like toned and smaller.

179
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,395
Don't make everything smaller.
I don't want to
generalize that way.

180
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,662
Tighter.

181
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:26,204
We don't want you
to lose weight. We just
want you to be healthy.

182
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,366
Okay.
You know, by eating less.

183
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,503
We would just like it
if you go home
and step on a scale

184
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,015
and write down
how much you weigh
and subtract it by, like, 20.

185
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,916
Twenty.
And then weigh that much.

186
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,682
Just remember,
you've got it here,
you've got it here

187
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,884
and everybody's gonna
see you right there.

188
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,292
Yay! That's so exciting!
Oh, my God!

I got a promotion.

192
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,759
Oh, congratulations!
Thank you.

193
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,268
Hey, maybe you can
get your own place now.

194
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,134
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

195

Let's go celebrate.

196

I'm so excited!

202
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,150
I walked in on him
masturbating one night.

203
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:17,484
Did he get the
deer-in-the-headlights look?

204
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,615
(LAUGHlNG)
Did he freeze
or did he finish?

205
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,718
No, he tried to pretend
like he wasn't doing
anything under the covers.

206
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,024
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)

Oh, no!

208
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,097
I buy these nice towels,
and he whacks off into them.

209
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,400
Deb and Pete, forever.
And...

210
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,272
And once he does that
into them once,
they're never soft ever again.

211
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:44,273
I can always tell if I'm
looking good based on
whether or not we get in.

212
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,985
Ladies?
Guess we're looking good.

213
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,350
If I didn't get in,
I would've lost my shit.
What's going on, man?

214
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,320
How long you gonna
make us wait out here,

saw again the other day,
which is fucking, like,

218
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,091
mind-blowing,
and I haven't seen it
since it came out is Munich.

Oh, Munich!

Oh, man, Munich fucking rules.
Munich is awesome!

221

kicking fucking ass!

it's because
of Eric Bana in Munich.

Oh, cool. What is it?

466
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,698
I'll give you the virtual
experience, okay? How's that?

467
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,102
You're at your computer.
Mmm-hmm.

468
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,663
Who's an actress you like?

469
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,175
Mary Tyler Moore?
No.

470
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,404
That does not work at all.
No?

No.
Okay.

472
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:51,476
Let's say you love Meg Ryan.
I do.

473
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,881
Great. Who doesn't?
Yeah.

474
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,418
Let's say you like her so much

475
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:58,250
you wanna know every movie
where she shows her tits.

476

And not just that,
but how long into that
movie she shows her tits.

48 minutes in,
like an hour and 10 minutes...

479
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,063
She's, like, naked
that whole fucking movie.

480
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,196
She does full frontal
in that movie.
Wow.

481
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,504
They should've called her
Harry, not Sally.
Really.

482
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,737
I'll show it to you.
I'll show you Meg Ryan's bush.

483
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:20,937
Okay.
Cool.

Yeah, I actually need
to get going, so...

Well, could...
Can I get your number?
I mean, I don't...

486

We had fun, right?
We should hook up again.

487

I'm gonna give you my card
'cause that'll be
the best way to...

to contact me, I don't have
a cell, right now,

Okay.
So, awesome.

All right, then.
Nice to meet you.

Yeah. Okay.
Bye. Take care.

Yeah, that was brutal.

500

It was a huge mistake.
What's a mistake?

Nothing. Nothing that we need
to talk about right now.

503
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,664
Why did you do it?

504
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,132
Aunty Allison drank
too much chocolate milk.

505
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:29,009
And I was feeling weird
because of that.
And I made a...

506
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:30,308
I think that's enough.

Thank God.

Do you think
you'll do it again?
No, no way.

511
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,323
She was totally
repulsed by me.

512
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,657
What?
She just really
didn't seem to like me.

513
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,254
Like, she wasn't laughing at my jokes.
I mean, I'm like a funny guy.

00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,300
Fucking funny as balls.
Hilarious, man.

Nothing. She thought our
web page was a bad idea.

What?
That fucking stuck-up bitch.

Yeah, I think so, too.

I think it's awesome
that you had sex with her.

519

If a goofy guy like you
had sex with her, I feel like
I had sex with her also.

I just wish I remembered it.

I'm sorry,
let me take that again.
Okay.

Tell me, were you a big fan
of the comic books growing up?

No, actually,

the comic books until

of you puking?

fucking joke shows,
I'm not into it.

But it works out
in my advantage,
I think, ultimately,

709
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,162
'cause I don't have
to pay any taxes.

710

So financially that's helpful

711
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,168
'cause I don't have
a lot of money.

So, how do you... Right.
How do I pay rent and shit?

719
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,657
When I was in high school,
I got ran over
by a postal truck.

720
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:42,926
Oh, my God.
It just kind of...

721
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,662
It was my foot
more than anything.

722
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,796
But I got like 14 grand from
the British Columbia government.

723
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,500
Right.
And that really lasted me.

724
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,939
I mean, until now.

725
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,171
It's been almost 10 years.
I have like 900 bucks left.

726
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,009
So that should last me for,
like, I mean, I'm not
a mathematician,

727
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,515
but like another
two years or some shit.

I really need to tell you.

could this happen?

I don't know. I mean,
I thought you were
wearing a condom.

740
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,501
No.
What?

741
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,043
I wasn't.
Why not?

742
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:28,373
Because you told me not to.

743
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,878
What are you talking about?

744
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,812
What am I talking about?
You told me not to.

745
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,351
I did not tell you
not to wear a condom.

746
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,545
Here's what happened, okay?

747
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,088
I will give you a play-by-play
of my memory.

748
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,851
I almost had
the condom on my dick.

749
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,018
It was on the cusp,
and then you said,
"Just do it, already."

750
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,425
I didn't mean do it
without a condom.

751
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,258
I meant "do it"
like "hurry up,"

752

Iike "Get fucking going!"

753
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,033
Well, I assumed
you were wearing a patch,
or like a dental dam

754
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,433
or one of those
fucking butterfly clips
or something like that.

755
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,266
What the hell is a dental dam?
It's like Saran Wrap!

756
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,670
It's disgusting, okay?
But I thought you had one.

757
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,606
Why the fuck didn't you
stop me once we started?

758
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,076
I don't know! I couldn't tell
that you didn't have one on!

759
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,612
Obviously, I was drunk!

760
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,011
Was your vagina drunk?

761
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,107
Did you think
it's the thinnest condom
on earth I have on?

762
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,879
I'm a fucking inventor?
I made a dick-skin condom?

763
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,581

a penis and put it on?

764
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,850
What the fuck?

765
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,623
You are unbelievable.

766
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:23,230
Okay, you know what? Maybe
I've reacted unfavorably.

767
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,270

769
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,070
and I thought you could
come with me
to the gynecologist.

770
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,804
So you haven't seen him,
though?
No.

771
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,276
So you don't know
if you're pregnant.

772
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,248
Well, I'm not 100% sure.
You're not 100% sure.

773
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,784
I bet you're not pregnant.

No, they're not.

No, they're all in the bag.
They're in the bag.

Yeah. Come on.

I'm supposed to come?
Yes.

I'm... I'm Ben Stone.

Hi, there, champ.
Nice to meet you.

784
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,781
And you must be
Debbie's sister.
Yeah.

Allison. Hi.

00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,057
Hi. How are you?
Good.

787
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:24,891
So, what can
I help you with today,
Mr. and Mrs. Stone?

788
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,362
I took a home pregnancy test,
and it said I was pregnant,

Thank you.

Well, you do look
a lot like your sister.

(CHUCKLlNG)

00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,699
Okay, there is
the cervix and the uterus.

799
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,938
See that?

800
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:17,174
That dark sac there,
that's the amniotic sac.

801
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:21,212
And right there
in the middle is the embryo.

802
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,810
Do you see that flicker?
You know what that is?

803
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,981
Yeah, that's a heartbeat.

804

Yeah, it looks like
you are pregnant.

I'd say.

a picture for you, huh?

I can't fucking believe
you didn't wear a bag!

Who does that?

823
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,764
Why did we go to Costco
and buy a year's supply
of condoms

824
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,034
if you weren't gonna
use them, man?

825
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,077
I can't believe you did this.
You fucked everything up.

is not to get yourself
in this position.

827

That's what
you have to realize.

828
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,940
You gotta know
all the tricks.

829
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,541
Like, for example,
if a woman's on top,
she can't get pregnant.

830
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,711
It's just gravity.
Well, that's true.
Everyone knows that.

831
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,186
What goes up must come down.

832
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:34,349
I think it's awesome that
you're gonna have a kid, man.

833
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:38,418
Think about it like this.
It's just an excuse to play
with all your old toys again.

I think you should do?

to get an "A" word.

Yes, I do, and I won't say it
for little Baby Ears
over there,

838
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,871
but it rhymes
with "Shma-shmortion."

839
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:52,205
I'm just saying...
Hold on, Jay, cover your ears.

840
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:55,973
You should get
a shma-shmortion
at the shma-shmortion clinic.

Ben, you cannot let
these monsters have
any part of your child's life.

there to rear your child.

Don't let him near the kid.

to rear your child!

845

I just have a quick question.

846
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,560
Do you use that Canadian
flag tattoo as a cum target
of some sort?

847
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,757
How many points do you get if you hit
the leaf? Like a million?

Oh, great. Now he's upset.
I won't let him do it.

Take care of it. Move on.

What's gonna happen
with your career?

858
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:39,721
How are you gonna tell them?

859
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,984
I'm not gonna tell them
for a while.

860
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,026
I have a while
before I have to say anything.

861
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,119
How could you not tell them?
They're not gonna know.

862
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,959
I mean, I'm only gonna start
to show when I'm like,

863
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,329
I don't know,
six months or something.
Seven months.

864
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,923
Three months.
No.

865
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:54,199
Three months. Fat in the face,
jowls, fat ass.

866
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,599
Debbie didn't get fat.

867
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:58,539
Debbie is a freak of nature.

868
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,306
Mom, you know,
it's important to me
that you be supportive.

869
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,339
I cannot be supportive
of this. This is a mistake.
This is a big, big mistake.

870
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,145
Now, think about
your stepsister.

871
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,550
Now, you remember
what happened with her?

872
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:13,317
She had the same
situation as you,
and she had it taken care of.

873
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:16,383
And you know what?
Now she has a real baby.

874
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,394
Honey, this is not the time.

875
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,730
I'm gonna be a grandfather.

876
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:21,923
You happy about that?

877
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,660
Absolutely. Delighted.

878
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:24,826
This is a disaster.

879
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,096
No, this is not a disaster.

880
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,695
It is...
An earthquake is a disaster.

881
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,831
Your grandmother
having Alzheimer's so bad

882
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:33,502
she doesn't even know
who the fuck I am,
that's a disaster.

883
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,477
This is a good thing.
This is a blessing.

884
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:39,482
I have a vision
for how my life would go,

885
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,074
and this definitely is not it.

886
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,882
Wait. Is this your vision?
Are you living
your vision right now?

887
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,182
I am kind of living
my vision, yeah.

888
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,087
Well, that is sad,
I'm telling you.

889
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,592
Life doesn't care
about your vision. Okay?

890
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:52,026
Stuff happens.
You just got to deal with it.

891
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,929
You roll with it.
That's the beauty of it all.

892
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:58,263
I just don't get how I tell
the kid not to do drugs
when I do drugs.

893
00:38:58,369 --> 00:38:59,563
I'll feel like a hypocrite.

894
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,730
Well, remember what I told you
when you were a teenager?

895
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,774
What did you say?
I said,
"No pills, no powders."

896
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:05,933
That's right, that's right.

897
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,443
Right. If it grows
in the ground,
it's probably okay.

898
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,743
I mean, I guess it worked.
Like you told me not
to smoke pot all those years,

899
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,875
and then I found out
you were smoking pot
that whole time.

900
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,442
Not the whole time.

901
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,284
Just in the evenings
and all day every weekend.

902
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,914
Not that much.

903
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:26,361
Honestly, though,
when you look at me
do you not think at all, like,

904
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,057
"You know,
if he just never existed,

905
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,465
"l would have avoided
a massive heap of trouble,"
you know?

906
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,196
Absolutely not.

907
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,431
I love you totally
and completely.

908
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,905
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

909
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,533
I'm the best thing
that ever happened to you?

910
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,804
Yeah.

911
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,138
(LAUGHS)
Now I just feel bad for you.

Good, good.

To let you know that I've
decided to keep the baby.

918
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,128
I'm keeping it.

919
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,399
Oh.

920
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:14,172
Yeah. So, that's
what's happening with that.

921

I was hoping you'd do.

Yeah. Yeah, it is good.

Okay, I know
we didn't plan this,

925
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:28,087
and, you know,
neither of us really thought
it was gonna happen,

926
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,683
but life is like that,
you know,

927
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,387
you can't plan for it.

928
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,827
And even if we did plan,

your plans, necessarily.

to go with the flow and,

I'm gonna do,
you know. It's...

you saying that.

help me by telling me, like,

00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:57,438
I told my roommates
I thought I was gonna
get a B.J., so...

1075
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,606
You know what?

1076
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,515
For the sake of getting
to know one another,
can you not talk like that?

1077
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:05,486
Yeah, I can do that.
I'm... I'm really nervous.

1078
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,421
I'm nervous, too.
I'm really nervous.

1079
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,049
Yeah.

1080
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,028
You're a sweet guy, right?

1081
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,574
I think I am. Yeah.

1082
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,701
Don't fuck me over, okay?

1083
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,807
I wouldn't do that.

1084
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:34,048
Just so you know,
I'm the guy girls fuck over.

1085
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,244
I'm that guy.
So you don't fuck me over.

1086
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,411
Okay?
Okay.

1087
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,854
I couldn't take it.
I can't raise this baby alone.

1088
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,638
Who's he?

1089
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,336
I'm Ben Stone.

1090
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,109
He's my boyfriend.

1091
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,742
That's nice.

1092
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:08,511
I've never met him before.

1093
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,416
Well, he's a new boyfriend.

1094
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,714
But a boyfriend.

1095
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:14,951
So he came over
for breakfast because
he's your new boyfriend?

1096
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,923
DEBBlE: Yeah.
He came from his house.

1097
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:18,688
Drove over to our house

1098
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,595
because he thought
it would be fun
to have breakfast with us,

1099
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:25,794
so he drove his car
from his house to our house
to have breakfast.

1100
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,030
Because he likes
breakfast so much.

1101
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:30,039
I love breakfast.

1102
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:34,271
You guys wanna hear something neat?
We're gonna have a baby together.

1103
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,369
SADlE: What?
Yeah, a baby.

1104
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,777
Well, you're not married.

1105
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,974
Aren't you supposed
to be married to have a baby?

1106
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,277
You don't have to be.

1107
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,615
But they should be
because they love each other,

1108
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,212
and people who love each other
get married and have babies.

1109
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,280
Mmm-mmm.

1110
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,388
Do you love each other?

1111
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,793
Yes, they love each other.
Because that's what you do.

1112
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:57,890
When you love each other,
you get married
and have a baby.

1113
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,629
Where do babies come from?

1114
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,727
DEBBlE: Where do you think
they come from?

1115
00:49:01,805 --> 00:49:05,104
Well, I think a stork,
he drops it down,

1116
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,268
and then a hole goes
in your body,

1117
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,744
and there's blood everywhere,
coming out of your head,

1118
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:13,180
and then you push
your belly button,
and then your butt falls off,

1119
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,343
and then you hold your butt
and you have to dig,

1120
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,648
and you'll find a little baby.

1121
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,620
That's exactly right.

1122
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,855
Feed the teddy bear.

1123
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,485
Okay, I feed
your bear the grass?

1124
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,592
Okay.

1125
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,465
You know what your bear
would also like
to do with some grass?

1126
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:33,867
(LAUGHlNG) Smoke it.

1127
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:37,471
What do you think of him?
He's funny, right?

1128
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,769
Mmm-hmm.

1129
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:40,469
Fetch.

1130
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:42,307
All right, bring it back.

1131
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,171
He's playing fetch
with my kids.

1132
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:46,749
He's treating my kids
like they're dogs.

1133
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,216
No, he's not.

1134
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,513
Go get it! Fetch!

1135
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,520
DEBBlE: Who plays fetch
with kids?

1136
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,714
ALLlSON: He's trying.
He's making an effort.

1137
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,224
BEN: Bring it back.
He's overweight.

1138
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,691
Where does that end?

1139
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,557
How old is he?
23.

1140
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,028
Looks 33.

1141
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:04,361
He can barely get in and out
of that little house.

1142
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,402
Imagine how much bigger
he's gonna get.

1143
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,698
That means he has bad genes.

1144
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,035
Your kid is gonna
be overweight.

1145
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,405
Shit.

1146
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,033
I'm gonna get you!

1147
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,407
I'm gonna get...

1148
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,806
(GROANS)

1149
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,109
(KlDS LAUGHlNG)

1150
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,047
Just give him a break.

1151
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:22,882
(EXCLAlMS)

1152
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,981
Okay. I'll try.

1153
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,160
They seem to love bubbles.

1154
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:38,360
Oh, God. They go
ape shit over bubbles.

1155
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,527
They're really going ape shit.

1156
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:43,095
I mean, that's an incredible
thing about a child.

1157
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,696
I mean, what's so great
about bubbles?

1158
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,938
They float. You can pop them.
I mean, I get it. I get it.

1159
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,208
I wish I liked anything as much
as my kids like bubbles.

1160
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,613
That's sad.
It's totally sad.

1161
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:58,620
Their smiling faces just
point out your inability
to enjoy anything.

1162
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,713
Am I gonna be okay, man?

1163
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,616
Oh, who knows?

1164
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:06,789
Is anybody okay? I'm not okay.

1165
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,421
You're asking the wrong guy.

1166
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,592
Just don't ask me to lend you
any money, you know?

1167
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,566
Can I just have some?

1168
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,530
No.

1169
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,500
I have 15 years
of tennis lessons.

1170
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,741
And 12 years
of sucking dick lessons.

1171
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:25,907
So?

1172
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,643
I can't ref the next games,
by the way.

1173
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,720
I got to go meet
gynecologists with Allison.

1174
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,778
She doesn't like
her gynecologist.

1175
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,289
JAY: You think she likes you?
She's trying to.

1176
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:39,093
She's entertaining
the idea of liking you.
Exactly. I'll take that.

1177
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,562
Yeah, well, see,
she's bringing you
to the gynaechiatrist.

1178
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,826
She must like you.
Yeah. Pretty good, I think.

1179
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,664
You know who
I'd like to get pregnant,
is that Felicity Huffman, man.

1180
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,170
Ever since Transamerica, I can't
get her out of my mind.

1181
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,502
Okay, guys. I hate to
crack the whip,

1182
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,736
but it's kind of
business meeting time.

1183
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,176
I need moolah.

1184
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,804
When do you think
we can launch this site?
Jeez.

1185
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,405
Look, man. You can't rush this.

1186
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,179
You know what happens
to these sites when they go up

1187
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,946
and they don't function well?
They die.

1188
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,512
Seriously, guys, let's say
I want to launch today.

1189
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,422
Let's start. Let's use that
as a jumping off point.

1190
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:12,519
Let's make this happen.
What can we do?

1191
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,325
Look, man, I didn't go
to Yale so I could work
12 hours a day.

1192
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:16,956
I thought you went
to Santa Monica City College.

1193
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,591
I went where I went, Jason.

1194
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,533
BEN: I'm not asking you
to work 12 hours a day.

1195
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,265
I mean, you guys watch movies
without nudity in them.

1196
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,173
I'll tell you what, man.
We could probably
get it online in three months.

1197
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:27,937
Thank you. Yes! Three months.

1198
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,876
JONAH: Come on, Jason!

1199
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,379
Fuck off!

1200
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,847
Yeah, well, you still have
a little dick, Cartman.

1201
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,881
Do you have mints?
Yeah, right there.

1202
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,852
I see what you're saying.
Totally.

1203
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:40,855
I don't get how
you're comfortable
with any of these guys

1204
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:42,652
when they're doing
what they're doing to you.

1205
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,853
First guy...

1206
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,725
Oh, there that shit is.
I've been looking for that.

1207
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,800
The first guy,
when he put his finger in,
he gave me this look like,

1208
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:55,736
"Sorry, man, it's the job"
and I'm like, "Don't look
at me when your finger's..."

1209
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,672
I mean, get in and get out.
Get on with your day,
you know?

1210
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:02,234
That's the closest
I'll ever come to being
in a threesome, I think.

1211
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,403
Really?

1212
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,981
If you had to do a threesome
with me and one
of my other roommates,

1213
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,641
who would it be?

1214
00:53:07,717 --> 00:53:08,706
Um...

1215
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:10,410
I'm gonna have to go with Jay.

1216
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:11,715
Oh, no.

1217
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:12,981
Yeah.
Jay?

1218
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:16,219
I'm really turned on by his
sort of skinny awkwardness

1219
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:19,090
and his hot little Mohawk.
His Mohawk.

1220
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,529
You two are never allowed to be in
the same room ever again.

1221
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,727
If we ever had a three-way
with Jay, you turn around,
he'd be sucking my dick.

1222
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:26,927

Do you smoke cigarettes?

1225
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,775
I have on occasion.

1226
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:36,073
On occasion? When? When was
the last time you had one cig?

1227
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,646
You know, one, you know, little...

1228
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,342
I need to know,
or I will not be your doctor.

1229
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,681
How you doing?

1230
00:53:43,753 --> 00:53:46,916
I'm breathing like James
Gandolfini over here.

1231
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,392
Slow down, man.
You're making me look
like a jackass.

1232
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,121
How long you kids
been married?

1233
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,526
We're not.
No.

1234
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:54,586
You're single?

1235
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,030
She's not single.
She's just not married.

1236
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,091
Are you two together?

1237
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,361
Hey, you wanna
trade boyfriends?

1238
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,463
(LAUGHS)

1239
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,770
Just kidding. Kind of.

1240
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:09,667
(EXCLAlMS)

1241
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,149
That is not your vagina.
That's your asshole.

1242
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,117
That happens
about five times a day.

1243
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,718
Are you sure you don't
wanna come paintballing?

1244
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,984
Have fun, guys. Seriously.
Watch the eyes.

1245
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,889
See you, guys.
JASON: See you, Ally. Bye.

1246
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,293
I don't wanna go.
I swear to God.

1247
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,957
I wanna see Breathless
at the LACMA.

1248
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,635
Boobs! Boobs, boobs, boobs!

1249
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,136
Hold on, pause it,
pause it, pause it.

1250
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,763
Boobs and bush!
Boobs and bush.

1251
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,501
Good boobs.
Those are good ones!

1252
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,405
We're like
35 seconds in. Nice.

1253
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,308
Right in
the beginning credits.
Credit bush.

1254
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,846
You never get
opening credit bush.
I know. That's so crazy.

1255
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,642
No.

1256
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,684
You got me.

1257
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,580
You got me.

1258
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,415
How many doctors are there
in your practice?

1259
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,016
Just 'cause I'm sort of
looking for a more
personal experience.

1260
00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:00,255
I wanna make sure
that you're my doctor
on the day, and...

1261
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,127
Yeah, I understand.

1262
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:07,026
We have three other doctors
in the practice,
but I'm your man, okay?

1263
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,867
I don't take vacations.
I hate Hawaii.

1264
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,405
I went to the Caribbean
when I was 14,

1265
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,807
(ALL LAUGHlNG)
and I'm never going back.

1266
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,278
I feel really good about this.
I think we found our doctor.

1267
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,541
Really?
Yeah.

1268
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,910
All right.

1269
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,349
Are you serious right now?
Yeah.

1270
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,612
Wow.

1271
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,814
You look relieved.
I am very relieved.

1272
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,982
I can't imagine meeting
any more of you people.

1273
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,923
You're being dramatic.
We didn't meet that many.

1274
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,867
Do they know?

1275
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,063
Pardon?

1276
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,240
The belly.

1277
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,936
Oh, yeah. The donuts,
they call to me.

1278
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:51,608
Hey, Allison. Great job.
Thanks.

1279
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,880
You're pregnant, aren't you?
What?

1280
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,546
I mean, you've put on like,
eight pounds, nine.

1281
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,556
It's all in your uterus.

1282
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,489
Oh, shit.

1283
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:07,353
I haven't told them.
Do you think
they're gonna be mad?

1284
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:09,955
I'm, like, really
chickening out about this.

1285
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,058
It's okay. We can hide this.

1286
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:15,797
We'll dress you in black,
and we'll emphasize
your boobs.

1287
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,032
Awesome.

1288
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,700
I mean, your boobs
are gonna be big.

1289
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:22,073
And then they're
gonna be, like, scary big.

1290
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:25,807
But then they'll go down.
And then they'll stay down.

1291
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,544
Just... Just don't
say anything, okay?
Please don't say anything.

1292
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:32,417
Oh, no, I won't, I won't.
Just tell them. They'll be cool.

1293
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,883
Everybody loves
somebody pregnant.

1294
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,923
Did you see
this sex offender website?

1295
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,693
These are all the sex
offenders in our neighborhood.

1296
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,701
Looks like your computer
has chicken pox.

1297
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,464
Those are sex offenders.

1298
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,870
These people live
in our neighborhood.

1299
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,805
Well, I'll skip their houses
when we're trick-or-treating.

1300
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:55,276
What do you want me to do?
Form a posse?

1301
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,711
Got your six-shooter on you?
I got my lynching rope.

1302
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,008
You shouldn't take it
so lightly.

1303
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,242
I don't take it lightly.

1304
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:03,012
You know, I'm not gonna
go over to any of these
people's houses and say,

1305
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,212
"Hey, do you mind...
Can you baby-sit?"

1306
00:57:05,321 --> 00:57:07,221
If I didn't care about
these things,

1307
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:08,814
you wouldn't
care about anything.

1308
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,052
Care more.

1309
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,720
You're so concerned
with stuff, like
"Don't get them vaccinated.

1310
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:15,127
"Don't let them eat fish.
There's mercury in the water."

1311
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,792
Jesus, how much
Dateline NBC can you watch?

1312
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,335
I know we're supposed
to be nice
with each other right now,

1313
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:21,734
but I'm having
a really hard time.

1314
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:23,965
I'm struggling
with it right now.
What am I doing?

1315
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,170
'Cause I want to rip your
fucking head off because
you're so fucking stupid!

1316
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:31,509
This is scary.
These are our children.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

1317
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:35,381
You fucking dipshit.
God! You...
Mmm-hmm.

1318
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:38,079
I literally am at a point where
I don't know what I can say.

1319
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,348
So I'm the bad guy

1320
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:42,585
because I'm trying to protect
our kids from child molesters
and mercury?

1321
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:45,092
And you're cool
'cause you don't give a shit.

1322
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,686
Yeah.
Yeah? Is that it?

1323
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:50,494
Pretty much.
God, you're an asshole.

1324
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,762
Don't do this in front of Ben.

1325
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,997
I don't give a shit about Ben.

1326
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:56,265
Sorry, Ben.

1327
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,330
It's okay. I didn't think
she did, anyway.

1328
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,069
Okay, come on! Let's go.

1329
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,770
Oh, I can't go.

1330
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:04,678
This band is doing a showcase
out in the Valley. I got to go.

1331
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,271
It's Saturday.

1332
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,077
I got to go.

1333
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,420
DEBBlE: You don't want to know
the sex of the baby?

1334
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,183
That's no fun.

1335
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:16,623
Ben knows, but I've
sworn him to secrecy.

1336
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,387
I'll get it out of him.

1337
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:19,587
No.

1338
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:27,530
Hey.

1339
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:30,767
Think we'll ever be as happy
as Baby Bjrn couple is?

1340
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:32,603
We are that happy.

1341
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,433
Yeah. You look happy.

1342
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,104
Which is awesome,
'cause I never like
guys like you. It's great.

1343
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,976
You keep saying that. I know.

1344
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:41,312
This is it. This is perfect.

1345
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,416
Nice.

1346
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,420
Holy shit! It's 1,400 bucks.

1347
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:47,285
We can just borrow yours.
Is that okay?

1348
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,382
No. You need your own crib.

1349
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,087
You know, there's one
of these lying in an alley
behind my house.

1350
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,823
We could just grab that.
Just rub Purell all over it.

1351
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,296
You know what? Let me buy it.

1352
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,197
I need to get you
a baby present anyway.

1353
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,293
And I would love
to get it for you.
ALLlSON: No.

1354
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,665
I'm serious. I want to.

1355
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,706
No. It's too much.

1356
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,034
(SHUSHlNG)

1357
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,973
Yes. We'll take it.

1358
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:10,170
Obviously, I mean,
don't insult the woman.
She wants to get us a gift.

1359
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,304
Right.

1360
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,178
Wanna buy me some new shoes?
What else can l
squeeze out of you?

1361
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,115
Xbox 360. Xbox 360.

1362
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:19,778
So hot in the Valley.

1363
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:23,019
ASHLEY: Hey! Oh, Allison!
GlRL: Hi.

1364
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:24,684
How are you?

1365
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:27,285
It's so good to see you.

1366
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,422
We've been watching you on E!
It's the coolest thing.

1367
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,524
Yeah, it's been super
exciting, just crazy busy.

1368
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,124
I'm so sorry I haven't called.

1369
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:34,669
GlRL: Oh, it's fine.
Hi, I'm Ashley.

1370
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:35,931
This is my friend, Ben.
I'm Ben.

1371
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,336
I went to school with Allison.

1372
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,340
Okay, so, is Debbie
having another baby?

1373
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,809
No. Allison is.

1374
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:44,642
What? I just saw you
a couple months ago.
You're pregnant?

1375
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,705
It was a big surprise.

1376
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:48,943
It's actually... It's a really
funny story, actually.

1377
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,508
If you guys... If you got
a second to hear it.

1378
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,178
It's not really funny.
It's not funny.

1379
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:55,052
Let them be the judge, okay?
I think it's funny.

1380
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,955
You know they say
don't drink and drive?
Uh-huh.

1381
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,392
BEN: Don't drink and bone!
GlRL: Wow.

1382
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:00,553
Okay.

1383
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:03,721
Yeah, I mean,
she was acting weird,

1384
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,427
and I really think
it's just 'cause, like,

1385
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:07,469
you know, I haven't made
an honest woman out of her.

1386
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:10,028
She's carrying my bastard child.
No one wants that.

1387
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:12,334
That's what I did.
I mean, I married Debbie
when she got pregnant.

1388
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,966
You think she's, like,
hiding me?

1389
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,409
Like, she's, like, embarrassed
by me or something like that?

1390
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,571
Probably. I'd hide you.

1391
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:20,444
How much do wedding rings cost?

1392
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:21,983
I mean, it really depends,
you know?

1393
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,077
I think you're supposed to spend,
like, three months' pay on a ring.

1394
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,213
That'll be easy.
I don't make any money.

1395
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,814
Really? I thought there was
lot of money in porn.

1396
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,723
God, it's not porn, okay?

1397
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:35,696
All we do is we show you
what nude scenes
are in what movies.

1398
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,198
Oh, like Mr. Skin?

1399
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,528
Who's Mr. Skin?

1400
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:40,398
Dude, Mr. Skin.

1401
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:42,568
Mr. Skin?

1402
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,235
JONAH: No!

1403
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,572
JONAH: We've wasted
14 months of our lives.

1404
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,169
This is exactly
the same as our site.

1405
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:51,508
How the fuck did this happen?

1406
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,845
Mr. Skin. That's even
a better name than ours!

1407
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,076
Fuck me in the beard.

1408
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:57,379
Dude, they got the top 10
group shower scenes!

1409
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:58,852
Why didn't you think
of that, Jay?

1410
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:00,354
Don't put this on me!

1411
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:01,515
God damn it!

1412
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:05,721
Well, shit, I saw it online
at one point, but I guess
I didn't connect the dots.

1413
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:06,988
What are we gonna do now?

1414
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,156
All we need to do is think
of a new, better idea

1415
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:10,927
that no one else
has thought of already.

1416
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:13,764
Oh, dude, Spider-Man 3
starts in eight minutes.

1417
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,202
JONAH: Don't worry, man.
We'll figure it out.

1418
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,578
You know what?

1419
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,673
I think just because
this site exists

1420
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,082
doesn't mean our site
won't work, necessarily.

1421
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,585
Good things come
in pairs, man, you know.

1422
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,019
Oh, for sure.

1423
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:36,752
Volcano, Dante's Peak,
Deep Impact, Armageddon, right?

1424
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,520
Wyatt Earp, Tombstone.

1425
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:41,188
Panda Express,
Yoshinoya Beef Bowl.

1426
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:42,925
Exactly. We can work together.

1427
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,194
This can help us,
if anything, I think.

1428
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,599
We're fine. We're golden.

1429
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:52,106
Look, Allison, I'm sure
this isn't how you pictured
it being, exactly,

1430
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,540
and it's not
how I wanted it to be,

1431
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,636
but that is why I'm presenting
you this empty box.

1432
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,578
It's a promise, Allison.

1433
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:02,311
It's a promise
that one day I will...

1434
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:06,821
I will fill this box
with a ring that you deserve,
a beautiful ring.

1435
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:08,481
And I can't afford it yet.

1436
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:12,960
I've picked it out already,
though, and it's at De Beers,
and it's really nice.

1437
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:17,465
So basically I'm asking you,
will you marry me?

1438
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,161
Because I'm in love with you.

1439
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,972
I love you, too.

1440
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,530
Really?

1441
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:27,838
Oh, man,
that's so nice to hear.

1442
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:31,778
That's the first time a girl's
ever said that to me, so...

1443
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,974
But here's the thing.

1444
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,484
There's a thing?

1445
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,522
I don't really know yet what
that love means, you know.

1446
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:44,683
Just 'cause it's so new,
and it's so exciting
that it's great.

1447
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,754
I don't know. We've only
known each other
17 weeks, so it's...

1448
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,264
Okay.

1449
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:53,302
Honestly, I mean, I thought...

1450
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,963
I thought you felt weird
that we're having a baby

1451
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,596
and we're not
engaged or anything.

1452
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:58,970
I'm gonna get off my knee.
Yeah.

1453
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,565
It's hurting a little bit.

1454
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,940
No, I'm okay with that.

1455
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:04,673
You know, we're just doing
what we can.

1456
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,840
We're making the best of it,
and I don't want us

1457
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,315
to put any more pressure
on ourselves
than we already have.

1458
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:10,977
Okay. Yeah.
That makes perfect sense.

1459
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:12,611
Are you okay? I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

1460
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,623
No, no, no.
Honestly, I just wanted
to do right by you, you know?

1461
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:18,558
So if you don't want to,
that's totally cool, you know?

1462
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:19,889
Okay.

1463
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,292
I really do love you.

1464
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,957
I know. Thanks.

1465
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:26,365
You mentioned that. It's nice.
