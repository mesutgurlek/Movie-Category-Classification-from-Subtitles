I am a doctor.
This is my surgery.

-I don't care!

your authority!

What is wrong with your feet?

331
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:44,381
I have terrible corns.

332

You are a quartermaster.

334
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:50,500
You must have access
to medical supplies.

335
00:25:50,588 --> 00:25:54,264
To treat your corns,
I will need morphine...

sulphur ointment...

And not a single reply.

351

these men get into...

to look after them.

If we catch his fleas and lice,
I'm going to skin him alive.

and zinc for scabies.

and you know so many things.

At least you can see
what you are getting.

Not much of a bargain, is he?

You fall in love

is one of our heroes.

He has a hundred medals
for saving life...

377
00:29:01,162 --> 00:29:02,356
and none for taking it.

378

I want an explanation.

I want to know why
you have defaced the monument.

385

You have changed
the inscription to Latin.

Do you think you can
so easily erase our history?

387
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:24,795
Is this how you wage war?
By the chipping away of letters?

388
00:29:24,883 --> 00:29:26,032
I must protest.

389
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:27,762
You cannot protest.
There is no excuse.

390
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:30,881
I was about to protest because
I was not responsible for it.

391
00:29:30,964 --> 00:29:32,682
Pathetic.

If you could tell me
where I'm going to sleep...

But where will
your daughter sleep?

It's none of your business
where I sleep.

Ah. Tonight I'll sleep
in the yard.

397

Tomorrow I'll request
alternative accommodation.

398
00:29:47,725 --> 00:29:49,717
I have made an arrangement
with your quartermaster.

You are staying here
whether you like it or not.

IANNIS:
When you fall in love...

835
01:07:14,602 --> 01:07:18,755
it is a temporary madness.

It erupts like an earthquake,

And when it subsides,
you have to make a decision.

Because this is what love is.

Love is not breathlessness.
It is not excitement.

844
01:07:49,445 --> 01:07:52,278
It's not the desire to mate
every second of the day.

I withdraw your battery
from Antisamos Beach.

If they wanted to bring in

if you surrender your arms...
