(NORMAL VOICE) Uh.

170
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:12,991
Helen is the preeminent
Virginia Woolf scholar.

171
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,727
It was quite a coup
to get her from Cambridge.

00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,529
But I think
she has other plans.

176
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,207
Good. So do I.

It's so wonderfully simple.

I'll tell you
what I'd like to know.

235
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:11,796
Why should I apply
to an elitist institution

236
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,200
with a history
of anti-black, anti-gay,
and anti-female oppression?

237
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,936
Well, actually,
I reject that stereotype...

238
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,506
Speaking of rejection,
don't you reject
99.9% of your applicants?

Don't you just want
to drum up applications

number-one position

Actually,
I think it's number two

00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,814
Yes, but...

it's an aberration.

in your room

of spending
all that money?

Well, there you go.

257
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:05,083
Okay. Right.
Well, Nelson.

258
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,018
Sure, sitting in
a room and reading books

259
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,354
would be
very cost-effective,

270
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:40,885
Just how will you
leave the planet better?

271
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:42,053
Will you eradicate disease?

272
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,855
You're gonna need
a medical degree.

273
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,891
If you want to create
new drug therapies,
that's a PhD.

Do you want to defend
the innocent

I regret to inform you

to go to law school.

My parents
work in a minimart.

291

They're not very educated.
Do you think
that matters or...

292
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,152
Of course not.
It's your application.

293
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,421
Maybe I should apply then.
Princeton seems
like a cool place.

294
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,956
It's very cool.

295
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,424
So you're saying
I should apply?

296
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,593
I'm not really
your typical student.

297
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,229
My brain sort of goes
on a little walkabout,
you know?

298
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,934
Yes, yes.
You should apply.

299
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,470
And if you
would like
to visit the campus,

300
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,005
we can match you
up with an undergrad

301
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,339
and you can spend
the night in his room.
Oh.

302
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:12,377
Then you could hang out
and get to know each other.

303
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,246
Um, I don't really hang
out with the applicants.

304

That's not how it works.
Right.

305

Because there's
over 20,000 of them.
Exactly.

306
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,419
Still, I think you
should get to know this one.

Yes. My mother thought
if she named me that,

309
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,526
I would grow up to be wise.

310
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:32,597
Or Minerva. Or Sophie.
Except a lot
of people are named Sophie.

311
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,399
They probably
don't even know
what their name means.

312
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:39,604
Or if your name was Aushenaya,
or Ifiok or Saraswati.

313
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,540
I think you got lucky

314
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,475
if you had to be
called something
that stands for wisdom.

315
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,182
Well, thanks for this.

Interesting kid.
He's a great kid.

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,060
Yeah, he's become
like a part of my family.

319
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,561
I met him at a garage sale.

320
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,363
He was reading
a law encyclopedia.

321

We went and had coffee,
and talked for five hours.

Sixteen years.

That's a long time
to stay in one place.

I've got
to get up very early

00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,790

and race back
for Mark's department lunch.

Fake?
You mean you
had a boob job?

382
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:27,171
No, no,
I had a mastectomy.

383

These are prosthetic.

384
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,741
I was wondering,
you know, women who
have really big breasts,

385
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,478
I thought, "I'd like
to see what that is like."

386
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,481
And I tell you,
they get so in the way,
it's unbelievable.

387
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,883
I'm thinking of trading
them in for a mid-size.

388
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,818
When? When did you
have a mastectomy?

389
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,856
I don't know.
Five weeks ago, or so.
Who keeps track?

390
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:46,824
They found a lump,
it was aggressive.

391
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,826
Hadn't spread yet.
I'm aggressive, too.

392
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,729
So I said, "What the hell?
Why push my luck?
Take 'em both."

393
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,432
Why didn't you tell me?

394
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,300
I am telling you.

395
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,503
Now.

396

you to the hospital.

I'm okay.

616
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,921
Why would I?

617
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,558
Everyone knows?

618
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,861
About Mark, I mean.
Yes.

619
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,831
And that Woolf woman.

620
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,602
I'm very sorry about
the timing of this.

621
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:43,073
But I want you to know,
I am here for you 1,000%.

622
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:46,109
This is my life.
It's what I'm good at.

623
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,444
I know.

624
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,246
And, please,
rest assured, Clarence,

625
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:52,015
that nothing
will affect my work.

626
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,150
Nothing.

627
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:56,086
Well, that's great.
You just carry on.

628

629
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,997
Mmm.

630
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,299
And that was
the famous Blair Arch.

631
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,238
Here comes one
of our illustrious
admissions officers.

632
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,540
Clearly a very
busy time for you all.

633
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,243
Any words of wisdom
for hopefully
future Princetonians?

634
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,011
What?

635
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,079
Words of wisdom?

636
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:23,180
Oh.

637
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:27,084
Just get those
applications in,

638
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:29,887
and remember to be yourself,

639
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:34,191
'cause who else could you be,
that's who you're stuck with.

640
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:39,129
Okay, got the idea.
Let's keep moving.

641
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,333
Any budding
astrophysicists
in the crowd?

642
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,402
'Cause I've got
a treat for you next.

643
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,672
I'm Jeremiah, from Quest.
Hi. You remember me?

644
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,007
Yes, I remember you.

645
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,275
I'm Nelson.

646
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:52,476
I remember you, too.

647
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,077
I'm John.

648
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,178
Turns out we had
a chance to come

649
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,380
down here today,
to visit the campus.

650
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:57,581
What a surprise.

651
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,118
It's awesome.
It's like, ancient!

652
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,353
I'm sorry, but what...
What do you think
that you're doing here?

653
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,689
Jeremiah wanted
to see the place.
And you and I should talk.

654
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:07,057
You are out of your mind.

655
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,226
Almost forgot to ask.

656
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:12,496
Um, remember when you
said that I could spend
the night with an undergrad?

657
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,665
Is that still possible?

658
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,935
Okay. Yes.
That's possible.

659
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:20,938
Just catch up
with the tour and meet me
back at Admissions.

660
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,325
What are you doing?
You're not allowed in here!

661
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:44,127
Nothing happened
the other night.

662
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,564
Right, it was nothing,
so don't let it get
in the way of this.

663
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:52,336
This is Jeremiah's
birth certificate.

664
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:54,972
I knew Shelley,
your roommate
at Dartmouth.

665
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:57,541
She borrowed it to pick you
up after you had the baby.

666
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,343
Valentine's Day.

667
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:03,080
Shelley told me you
had the baby at 1:00 p.m.
on Valentine's Day.

668
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,983
That stuck with me.
I hate Valentine's Day.

669
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,584
It's a despicable holiday.
It sucks.

670
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:10,287
Here's the crazy part.

671
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,388
When Jeremiah
applied to Quest,

672
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,090
I saw this
and I put it together.

673
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,758
It says that he was born
and given up for adoption

674
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,295
Valentine's Day,
1995, at 1:00 p.m.
at Blaine Hospital.

675
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,298
I know you
didn't ask for this.

676
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,766
And I'm not trying
to ruin your life.

677
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:27,637
and I think he could use
a little more
connection in his life.

678
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,208
I didn't tell him anything.

679
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,143
It's your decision.
I'm just setting it up.

He has his parents.
He has you, right? Nelson?

682
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:41,051
Yeah, his parents
are great people.

683
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,119
But we're moving on.

684
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,388
Nelson and me.

685
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,489
Hey, maybe it
was meant to be.

686
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:49,393
And you don't
just barrel into other
people's lives like this.

687
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:52,095
This is bad form.
This is bad form.

It's quite
an operation
you have here.

694
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:14,584
Okay, well,
Mr. Pressman
was just leaving.

695
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,752
Right. Of course.

696
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:22,059
Hey, I heard about you guys
dropping to number two.

697
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:26,129
Sorry. But number
two is, you know...
That's good, too.

698
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:28,165
Here's the information
you wanted for your student,

699
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,067
the undergrad
he'll be spending
the night with.

700
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:33,336
Thank you.
And here is the information
you'll need on that student.

701
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,641
Ben, do you mind escorting
Mr. Pressman out?

702
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:39,409
And, Mr. Pressman,
in the future,

703
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,112
e-mail is the appropriate form
of communication.

704
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:43,346
JOHN: Right. Sorry.

705
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:46,416
Yeah, e-mail.
(LAUGHS) Will do.

706
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,152
All right. See ya.

707
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:56,259
You know, it's highly unusual,
it's actually unheard of,

708
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,628
for a school director
to be back here.

709
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,797
I know.

710
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,166
I think we should
hire a security guard
to keep the crazies out,

711
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,469
because it is
getting out of control.

are supposed to use, right?

might be more
for baby teeth.

What the hell
were you thinking?

00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:23,286
Did you read
the rest of it?

00:45:23,288 --> 00:45:26,489
Why, am I missing
a police record?

00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:30,393
Come on, man.
Quit half-assing it, huh?

945
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:58,888
So? Those kids are

JEREMIAH:
When I was eight years old,
I realized my teachers

980
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,406
were not going
to be able to teach me.

981
00:47:57,408 --> 00:48:00,276
So I became an autodidact.

982
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:01,377
I read everything.

983
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:10,019
<i>mainly because</i>
<i>I didn't know how other</i>
<i>people lived their lives.</i>

984
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,196
<i>I learned several years ago</i>
<i>that I was adopted,</i>

985
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:24,567
<i>that my parents</i>
<i>tried so hard</i>
<i>to have on their own.</i>

986
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:27,103
<i>I think my voracious reading</i>

<i>that was missing.</i>

1007
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:13,382

Then I think there
was an evaluation card

1013
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,695
that was placed
on the wrong file.

1014
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:28,164
A Jeremiah Balakian.

1015
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,365
Balakian.

1016
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,000

00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,303

00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:38,741
You didn't mean
to put "High Consider,"

Um, let me see.

No, that's right.

1022
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,184
But he has
D's and F's
and suspensions.

1023
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:52,221
But did you
notice that he also got
fives on all eight AP exams

1024
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:55,191
without ever
taking any AP courses?

1025
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:58,127
Yes. I'm going
to investigate that.
That's impossible.

1026
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:02,765
No, apparently not,
if the child in question
is a unique, special child.

1027
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,502
This isn't a child.
It's an applicant.

He's got no
extracurriculars at all.

at his old high school
said he was shocked

Jeremiah was even
applying to college.

1031
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:13,676
He's an autodidact.

1032
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,545
He's an advanced reader
from the age of eight.

1033
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:21,684
Leonardo da Vinci
was an autodidact.
So was Benjamin Franklin.

1034
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:24,453
Oh, did this Balakian kid
discover electricity
or paint the  <i>Mona Lisa?</i>

1035
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,322
I must have missed
that in his file.

1036
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:27,790
He's a great kid.

1037
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:29,525

1038
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,660

No, I'm sorry.

Maybe you'd like
to step outside

1044
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,510
Only kidding!
Only kidding.

1045
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:50,780
Just a little levity

00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,364
The sad lady?
That's not really
how I think of myself.

1079
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:16,699
How is your mother?

1080
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:18,400
She's fine.

1081
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,703
So, I wonder,
would you consider

1082
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:23,706
conducting some supplementary
admissions interviews?

1083
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,708
A scholar
of your stature
would carry

1084
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,676
a huge amount of weight
with the committee.

1085
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:30,880
In fact, there is one
extremely unusual applicant

1086
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:33,582
who's shown a strong interest
in literature and philosophy.

1087
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:36,852
Why would I want to speak
with a high school student?

1088
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:40,856
Of course, perhaps
we could make some
sort of arrangement.

1089
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,691
SUSANNAH: I can't believe
you're pimping me.

1090
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:45,895
I'm not pimping you.
He's a fan of your writing.

1091
00:52:45,897 --> 00:52:48,430
And I need him
to meet this applicant.

1092
00:52:48,432 --> 00:52:50,499
Besides, when's the last time
you went to a party?

1093
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,701
With racist jockey
statues? Never.

1094
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:53,769
Yeah, those are
pretty weird.

1095
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,478
Hey, Portia!
Thanks for coming
to my party!

1096
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,746
Hi, Nelson,
happy birthday!

1097
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,216
Hey! I'm glad you
could make it.

1098
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,185
So, this is
your parents' place?

1099
00:53:09,187 --> 00:53:11,820
Hmm. Yeah.
Well, my mom's now.

1100
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:14,190
My dad passed
away a few months ago.

1101
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,457
Oh, I'm sorry.
No.

1102
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,561
It's nice to
see you again.

1103
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:20,229
You're not packing heat
by any chance, are you?

1104
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:21,497
Should I be?

1105
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:22,631
No, we're all friendlies.

1106
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,667
So, what is this?

1107
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:27,870
That is a fossil
from the Jurassic era.

1108
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,873
It's been in the same place
for 150 million years.

1109
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,208
Oh, cool!

1110
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:34,443
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

1111
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:35,678
Mom, I would like
you to meet...

1112
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,880
I'm Johnny's mother,
Mrs. Pressman.

1113
00:53:37,882 --> 00:53:43,519
Ah, no. No, we are friends.
Just friendly acquaintances.
Portia Nathan.

1114
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:45,754
Of course.
What am I thinking?

1115
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:51,427
He can't love anything
that's less than
a 10-hour flight from JFK.

1116
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:52,761
Maybe we don't have to go.
Right, Grandma?

1117
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:54,230
Nelson.

1118
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,265
You're absolutely
right, Nelson.

1119
00:53:56,267 --> 00:54:00,402
There's nothing wrong
with staying in the same
place for a while.

1120
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,439
Ask Portia. She's
been in the same
job for 16 years!

1121
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:04,940
Yeah. And it's
a travesty, Nelson.

1122
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:07,676
Portia was president
of her high school class.

1123
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:09,612
Mom.
And she resigned
in protest over

1124
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:11,547
funding
for the girls'
sports program.

1125
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:14,383
She led
a school-wide walkout.

1126
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:15,684
And the relevance
of all this is?

1127
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:20,256
When you were nine months old,
you could walk.

1128
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:21,991
She actually walked.

1129
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:25,527
I don't mean
just stumble walking
like an infant or a toddler.

1130
00:54:25,529 --> 00:54:27,763
She walked with
absolute certainty.

1131
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,399
One day I saw her tumble
over her shoelaces, John,

1132
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:32,768
she did not cry,
she didn't fall down,

1133
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,939
she sat down, carefully,
tied her shoelaces
in a double knot...

1134
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,941
(LAUGHING)
...got up and kept going.

1135
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,576
At nine months old.

1136
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:42,378
There are a lot
of holes in that story.

1137
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,748
You were fearless.
You were born an Amazon.

1138
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,516
That's amazing.
I love it!

1139
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:49,652
And what makes you think
she needs your approval?

1140
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:52,521
Okay, that's
enough crazytown.

1141
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:53,756
When Johnny got
admitted to Harvard Law...

1142
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:55,424
Oh, God.

1143
00:54:55,426 --> 00:54:58,694
...he decided to go
and live in Outer
Mongolia instead.

1144
00:54:58,696 --> 00:55:00,763
Outer Mongolia?
You know what, Portia,

1145
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:02,564
I'm with you,
enough crazytown.

1146
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:05,901
Have another vat
of gin there, Mom.

1147
00:55:05,903 --> 00:55:08,671
Ms. Nathan,
Vladimir Polokov.

1148
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:18,047
You are just as
beautiful today
as you were 30 years ago.

1149
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:20,349
I just had a mastectomy.

1150
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:22,451
I was just translated
into Finnish.

1151
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:23,952
(CHUCKLING)

1152
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:24,987
(SPEAKING FINNISH)

1153
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,322
Brilliant.

1154
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,857
May I get you
some iced tea?

1155
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,893
Or something stronger,
perhaps?

1156
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,429
Why not.
I'll stroll with you.

1157
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:36,598
I'd love to.
It would be a pleasure.

1158
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,337
It was a pleasure.
Your lawn jockeys
are just outstanding.

1159
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:42,404
Aren't they fun?

1160
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:50,546
And now, with a special
performance for Nelson
on his big day...

1161
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:51,814
(WHOOPING)

1162
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:53,982
(ALL APPLAUDING)

1163
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:57,119
...performing
the act that won him
honorable mention

1164
00:55:57,121 --> 00:56:00,456
at the New Hampshire
state championships,
put your hands together,

1165
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,124
(DRUMMING)

1166
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:04,927
put your hands together,

1167
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:06,562
for Jeremiah Balakian!

1168
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:14,536
I want to dedicate
this performance to Nelson.

1169
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,904
Happy birthday, pal.

1170
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,942
Honorable mention?
I thought you said he won.

1171
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:21,443
He was robbed.

1172
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:23,979
This is my other friend,
René Descartes.

1173
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:25,981
Say, hello, René.

1174
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:26,982
ALL: Hello, René.

1175
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,618
How are you, René?

1176
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:35,157
I think,
therefore I am.

1177
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:37,926
(LAUGHING)

1178
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,763
Did you say you're pink,
therefore you're ham?

1179
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:43,732
Do you have any advice
for a young man, René?

1180
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:50,139
Whatever you do,
don't put the horse
before Descartes.

1181
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:51,974
(LAUGHING)

1182
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:58,414
Hey, do you guys
want to see Descartes
philosophize backwards?

1183
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,984
I think, therefore I am.

1184
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:03,018
Oh, God.

1185
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,053
That's terrible.

1186
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,561
What was that?

1187
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:14,129
Come on, that showed
originality, depth.

1188
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:15,664
Are you kidding me?

1189
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:16,698
Here, from the
Island of Misfit Toys,

1190
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,000
we bring you
Jeremiah Balakian!

1191
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:19,134
Are those birds?

1192
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:20,669
Those are doves.

1193
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:21,804
For the party?

1194
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:24,006
No. You know,
my mom has a dove room.

1195
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,876
Uh, by the way,
I know that wasn't
a perfect showcase,

1196
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,445
but he can't pretend
to be somebody he's not.

1197
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,613
Yes, he can.
You should try
it sometimes.

1198
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,782
It's how humans behave
here on planet Earth!

1199
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,617
I know how humans
behave on planet Earth

1200
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,486
because I've actually
lived a few places
on planet Earth.

1201
00:57:37,488 --> 00:57:39,688
Wait! God.
Here, help me.

1202
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,756
Aren't you ready yet?

1203
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:41,990
I'm lighting them
as fast as I can!

1204
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:44,893
Hurry up!
Do you like the cake?

1205
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:46,128
It's very patriotic!

1206
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,664
Nelson's idea.

1207
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,866
Ow, how many frigging
candles are on this cake?

1208
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:53,702
Oh, Fifty. You know,
it was my mom's idea.

1209
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:55,871
Polokov was
looking at Jeremiah
like he had two heads!

1210
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:57,673
Well, that's his
problem, isn't it?

1211
00:57:57,675 --> 00:57:58,907
Look, I want Jeremiah
to go to Princeton,

1212
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,843
because he wants
to go to Princeton,

1213
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:02,478
and I actually think
he'd do great there,

1214
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,479
but if he doesn't
get into Princeton,

1215
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:07,182
well, that's fine, too,
because where
you went to school,

1216
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:09,751
and what your background is,
that is just a box,
and I reject it.

1217
00:58:09,753 --> 00:58:12,554
I reject being put
into a box, okay?

1218
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,563
Hi.
Hi, Mom.

1219
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:22,764
How did it go?
It was good.

1220
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:34,042
Mr. and Mrs. Balakian?
I'm Portia Nathan.

1221
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:36,111
Oh.
I want to say
thank you so much

1222
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:38,280
for everything
that you have
done for this boy.

1223
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,716
You're wonderful people.

1224
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,254
Uh, she's from Princeton.

1225
00:58:45,256 --> 00:58:46,755
Oh!

1226
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:48,524
Well, you're welcome.

1227
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:49,791
I love you.

1228
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,527
Okay.

1229
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:53,028
Uh, bye.

(SCREAMS)

1231
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,041
What are you doing here?

1232
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,643
I want to come
live with you.

1233
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:10,546
Why in God's name
would you want
to live with me?

1234
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:12,915
Because you're a normal,
boring adult.

1235
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:15,017
I bet you'd
take me
to Chuck E. Cheese!

1236
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,919
What makes you
think I'm so boring?

1237
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:19,621
You just are.
It's good!

1238
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:21,323
At your age, you're
supposed to be boring!

1239
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:22,591
I am the same age
as your dad.

<i>John, it's Portia.</i>
<i>I have Nelson.</i>

1241
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:27,796
<i>You do?</i>
<i>He's fine.</i>

1242
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:29,197
<i>He is?</i>
<i>Yes, he's fine.</i>

1243
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:30,065
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

1244
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,944
Nelson, you know how much
I love this statue, right?

1245
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:43,779
Yeah.

1246
00:59:43,781 --> 00:59:45,714
You rode a horse
three days through

1247
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:47,883
Outer Mongolia
in the pouring rain,

1248
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:49,785

milk to bring it back.

1249
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,119
That's right.

1250
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:53,088
And I've dragged
it place to place,

1251
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,324
across the world,
ever since I was 22.

1252
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:03,265
That is nothing,
nothing compared
to how much I love you!

1253
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:06,068
Please don't scare
me like that again.

1254
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,936
Why? You do it
all the time.

1255
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,137
Hide out in cars?

1256
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:10,706
Run away!

1257
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:15,310
And going across the world
and helping people
is not running away.

1258
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:19,047
I know,
but why can't we ever
just do what I want?

1259
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:21,783
Because you are a kid,
I'm an adult,

1260
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:24,653
what I say
in this house goes!

1263
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:40,102
Oh, it's a disaster.

1264
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:41,403
So I hear.

1265
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:43,772
I'm screwing it up.

1266
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:45,374
Am I screwing it up?

1267
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:47,275
You're asking me?

1268
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:49,945
I don't know, it's just,
Nelson and I have
always traveled.

1269
01:00:49,947 --> 01:00:52,080
I wanted to give
him the kind of life
I didn't have as a kid.

1270
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:53,882
I wanted to give
him the opposite
of what I had as a kid.

1271
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:56,418
But, now, all of a sudden
he's turning into my mother.

1272
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,421
He plays bridge.
He listens to Lite FM.

1273
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:01,323
He asked for a blue
blazer with gold buttons

1274
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:03,859
and anchors on
them for Christmas.

1275
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,427
Does your mom
wear blue blazers?

1276
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:06,895
No, that was my father.

1277
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,797
How is it possible?

1278
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:10,832
What am I doing wrong?

1279
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,769
At least you're trying.

1280
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,404
I mean, there's so many
different kinds of parents.

1281
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,841
There's no one
best way to do it.

1282
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:24,046
Or so I've gathered
with my vast experience
reading personal essays.

1283
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:30,118
Speaking of which,
I have 15 essays
to get through tonight. So...

1284
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,821
Right. Yeah.

1285
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,359
Well, thank you
for bringing him back.

1286
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,994
Of course.

1287
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,464
So, you really are
leaving, aren't you?

1288
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:44,900
Um, in a month and a half.

1289
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:54,743
I thought...

1290
01:01:54,745 --> 01:01:56,745
Let's just
not think for a while.

1291
01:01:58,314 --> 01:01:59,381

Yes.

Hi.

01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:10,018
Did you stay over?

1303
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,353
Too long of
a drive back to campus?

1304

I slept on the sofa.
Ah.

So did your mother.

1306

We did not make it
all the way to the bedroom.

1307
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:19,394
I didn't need to know that.

Interesting.

1309

mean myself, like,

Alice would like to retry him

Jeremiah is our first
applicant from Quest,

Developmental,
but academically rigorous.

1488
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,251
Jeremiah is an only child.

1489
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:52,653
Parents both
work at a Stop-N-Go.

1490
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,789
Neither of them
attended college.

1491
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:59,994
The first three years
of his high school life
were a disaster.

1492
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:02,263
If you're wondering
why you are even
listening to this,

01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:07,902
Jeremiah is also
a self-described autodidact
since the age of eight.

1494
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:11,906
In fact, he is
the most well-read person
I have met.

1495
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:12,974
Ever.

1496
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:18,813
And why?
For his resume?
To impress someone?

1497
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:22,817
For the sake of learning,
his passion for knowledge.

1498
01:15:24,653 --> 01:15:26,120
He had no plans
to attend college

1499
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:29,290
until this past fall
when he switched to Quest

1500
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:34,962
and came into contact
with teachers
who recognized his potential.

1501
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:39,534
Last spring,
he took the SATs
and eight AP tests.

1502
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,869
Wait, so he took
AP classes?

1503
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:45,606
No AP classes,
no SAT prep courses.

1504
01:15:45,608 --> 01:15:48,743
But he got 5's
on all eight APs,

1505
01:15:48,745 --> 01:15:53,814
and 790,
780 and 790 on the SATs.

1506
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,716
That's amazing.

01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:56,651
I'm sorry,
what did you say?

1508
01:15:56,653 --> 01:15:58,019
That's amazing.

1509
01:15:58,021 --> 01:15:59,921
Amazing!
It's amazing.
Exactly.

1510
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:04,792
Do you think he can handle
an intense academic community?

1511
01:16:04,794 --> 01:16:05,893

That's a great question.

1518
01:16:21,611 --> 01:16:25,680

1520
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:33,120

and then he was found.

1521

01:16:44,633 --> 01:16:46,701
Well, he is like no
other applicant we
have ever considered.

1524
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,204
His alumni interview
was not so great.

1525
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:51,606
That guy sounded
like a jerk.

(LAUGHING)

1527
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:58,913
And he has
a positive
recommendation from

1528
01:16:58,915 --> 01:17:01,248
no less of a scholar
than Vladimir Polokov.

1529
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:10,024
Okay, maybe from
our perspective, he
could have done more,

1530
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:14,629
made himself
more of a resume
and a paper trail,

1531
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:18,265
but he took
himself from nowhere
to where he is today.

1532
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:20,968
He educated himself,

1533
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:24,005
purely by instinct,

1534
01:17:24,007 --> 01:17:26,007
not because he wants
to put away
his mother's killer.

1535
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:31,145
He was as isolated

No, no, Jeremiah.

You were born
on Valentine's Day

1691
01:29:36,505 --> 01:29:39,740
at 1:00 p.m.
at Blaine General to me.

No, I was born
at 11:00 p.m.

1693
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:45,779
They said my mom tried
like hell to hold off
till the last hour

1694
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:48,115

You see?

1698
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:06,066
I never told anybody,
because I didn't want
my parents to find out.

1699
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:08,635
I was worried
that it would
hurt their feelings.

1700
01:30:08,637 --> 01:30:11,738
And I don't want
to hurt them 'cause
they're my parents.

1701

This whole time,
you thought
you were my mother?

1704
01:30:17,513 --> 01:30:18,945
Why didn't you tell me?

1705
01:30:18,947 --> 01:30:21,415
I didn't want
anything to get in

getting into Princeton.

to recuse
myself and...

1708
01:30:24,686 --> 01:30:27,020
So everything
you did was because
you thought I was your son?

No. I completely
believe in you!

1711

But you were lying
to me the whole time.

to be an 11!

This is all a stupid dream.

to get pregnant,

really not so great.
You didn't even ask his name.

So I will never
know who my father is.

Maybe he's in Paris.
Maybe he's in Hoboken.

01:39:09,377 --> 01:39:11,477
I can't promise anything.

1842
01:39:11,479 --> 01:39:14,213
But we'll contact you
if there's any news.

1843
01:39:15,382 --> 01:39:16,449
Okay.

1844
01:39:17,217 --> 01:39:18,484
JOHN: Hey.
Hey.

1845
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,587
It's a thin envelope.

1846
01:39:22,723 --> 01:39:23,990
That doesn't mean anything.

1847
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,226
Open it.

1848
01:39:41,275 --> 01:39:44,243
It says he's not ready
to meet me at this time.

1849
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:47,747
Well, okay.

1850
01:39:50,017 --> 01:39:53,319
Well, then,
you're on the wait list.

1851
01:39:55,189 --> 01:39:56,689
That's not so bad.

1852
01:39:56,691 --> 01:39:58,157
No, it's not.

1853
01:40:09,036 --> 01:40:11,070
Hey, Portia,
everything okay?

1854
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:13,206
Yes.

1855
01:40:23,484 --> 01:40:25,718
PORTIA:
<i>What's the secret</i>
<i>to getting in?</i>

1856
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,321
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

1857
01:40:28,323 --> 01:40:30,723
<i>You'll have to</i>
<i>find out for yourself.</i>
