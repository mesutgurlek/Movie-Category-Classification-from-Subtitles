"Dear Mr. Inman,

"then the months.

4

"l don't count on anything anymore
except the hope that you will return,

5
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:50,383
"and the silent fear that in the years
since we saw each other,

6
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:57,019
this war, this awful war, will have
changed us both beyond all reckoning. "

7
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:52,383
This poor boy's from Alabama,

8
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,216
- He's a long way from home,
- Thank you,

9
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:02,783
Why don't them Yanks just attack?

10
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:14,636
(man #4) Got any shirts, son?

11
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:21,205
Mm-hm-hm-hm

12
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:23,577
It's Mo Oakley's boy,

13
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,518
Can't be old enough to fight, can he?

14
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:36,150
- Good morning,
- Morning, son,

15
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:39,489
Got some boots and jackets,
You want one?

16
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:42,226
- Here, You want that?
- Thanks,

17
00:02:43,635 --> 00:02:46,126
I hope these boots can hold up
for 400 miles,

18

Same as us, Seen too much war,

28
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:51,970
Hey, Oakley, Don't worry, son,
Them Yankee boys keep store hours,

They ain't open yet,

- Hey, that's fresh breakfast,

34
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:30,266
- (Butcher) I saw it first!

"so out of place.

you'll be fightin' for?

(man #3) I tell you,
as soon as I finish this chapel,

(minister) Ben, thank you,
Will you assist my daughter?

Esco, you remember my daughter, Ada,

60
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:23,447
- Miss Monroe,
- Good morning,

Now, if y'all will excuse me,

In Charleston, my congregation would still
be disputing the size of the windows,

66
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:37,563
(Esco) It's a chapel,

67
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:40,661
(woman) Miss Monroe,
I was just thinkin' about you,

68
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:44,538
Cold Mountain must feel
like the end of the world,

69
00:06:44,642 --> 00:06:47,202
Not at all,

70
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:51,749
- It's very beautiful,
- Well, you put us all to shame,

71
00:06:51,816 --> 00:06:54,979
Men up here had a bearing on
what they thought a woman was,

72
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,352
- and then you showed up,
- Oh,,,

73
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:00,687
- No, I doubt that,
- Oh, believe me,

74
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:05,889
If you was to say a word to one of these
fools, I could get my top field cleared,

75
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:09,664
- Any one?
- No, um,,,

76
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:12,900
Him in particular,

77
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:14,996
Up in the rafters,

78
00:07:15,073 --> 00:07:17,871
Won't normally say boo to a goose,

79
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,679
He's been pressin' me
since the day you arrived here,

80
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,951
- Your top field cleared?
- That's right,

81
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:40,121
Good morning, I'm Ada Monroe,

00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:00,581
How 'bout that? Inman speaks,

89
00:08:00,652 --> 00:08:04,679
If you were to take a glass of cider,
your friends might stop staring,

90

Inman,

91
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:15,790

take her for a walk at Bishop's Creek,

ain't a square angle anywhere near it,

Clear fields?

100
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:47,563
I can clear a field,

101
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:52,432
Was there something in particular
you wished to say to me?

102
00:08:57,008 --> 00:08:59,636
Not that comes to me,

103
00:09:05,984 --> 00:09:08,714
I'll say thank you,,, for the cider,

157
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:08,020
- Well, that's a fine-sounding thing,
- Oh,,,

158
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,824
My piano,

159
00:17:12,436 --> 00:17:14,563
Oh, I've been missing it,

160
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:19,371
Thank you, by the way,
lnman's in my top field clearing his debt,

161
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:21,445
Oh, dear,

162
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:25,272
(sighs)

163
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:27,714
And then he had nothing to say,

164
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:30,276
He was happy,

165
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:33,989
Really?

166
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:36,925
Are men so different in Charleston?

167
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:40,657
Men?

168
00:17:42,066 --> 00:17:44,057
I don't know,

169
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:49,869
If you're sayin' you might like him,
why not go over and say good mornin'?

170
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,931
I should be gettin' along,

171
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:54,875
(lnman) Walk on, quickly,

172
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:58,039
Come on, Walk on, Slowly,

173
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,049
Walk on,

174
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:02,949
(piano)

175
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:12,729
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

176
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:47,157
(Monroe) My dear daughter, Ada,

177
00:18:47,231 --> 00:18:53,795
who's given up so much for so long to help
me in my ministry, and upon whom I rely,

178
00:18:56,407 --> 00:19:02,642
Friends, we are both very happy
to have this opportunity tonight,,,

179
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:06,579
to thank you from our hearts,,,

180
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:12,917
for your kind welcome
and, most of all, such a fine chapel,

181
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,355
(Monroe coughs)

182
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:16,757
So,,, (coughs)

183
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:19,819
,,,thank you, and God bless you,

184
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:29,065
Our house is always open
to any of you at any time,

185
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:31,630
Welcome,

186
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:32,766
Esco?

187
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:39,082
That gentleman - he help build the chapel?

188
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:42,175
(Esco) Him? No, that's Teague,

189
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:46,155
At one time the Teague family
owned the whole of Cold Mountain,

190
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:50,751
My farm, your farm,
it all belonged to his grandpappy,

191
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:53,353
Teague wanted this place bad,
and you got it,

192
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,228
And he's here sniffin' out an advantage,

193
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:03,968
(Monroe) There's no advantage here,
except to celebrate a job well done,

194
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:06,167
And that is a good thing
in these troubled times,

195
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:09,371
- (man) Miss Monroe,
- Thank you,

196
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:19,383
- Were you never planning to come inside?
- I'm wetter than a fish,

197
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:23,722
- There's a good fire going,
- I'm all right,

198
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:26,389
(Ada sighs)

199
00:20:26,463 --> 00:20:29,364
You're always carrying a tray,

200
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:35,163
I was going to take some root beer
over to the Negroes,

201
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:46,249
Somebody said you were enlisting,

202
00:20:46,317 --> 00:20:50,117
- Are you?
- If there is a war, we'll all fight,

203
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:07,068
- Did you get a picture made?
- Say again?

204
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:11,631
A tintype, with your musket
and your courage on display,

205
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,501
You're laughin' at me,

206
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:19,447
I don't know you,

207
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,553
This doesn't come out right,

208
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:32,152
If it were enough just to stand,
without the words,,,

209
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:35,922
It is,

210
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:40,836
It is,

211
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,805
You,,, Look,

212
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,277
Look, Look at the sky now,
What color is it?

213
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:55,350
Or the way,,, a hawk flies?

214
00:21:58,021 --> 00:22:00,819
Or you wake up,,,

215
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:05,328
and your ribs are bruised
thinking so hard on somebody,

216
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,021
What do you call that?

217
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:19,576
I'll do that,

218
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:23,641
I can't get much wetter,

219
00:22:26,183 --> 00:22:30,552
(Ada) "What if you are killed,
and I'll never see you again?

220
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:35,456
"You said after a few years
I would barely remember your name.

221
00:22:35,526 --> 00:22:38,017
"Oh, lnman.

222
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:42,862
It is more than three years,
and I remember your name. "

223
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:46,632
Soldiers, Don't get up,

224
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:50,866
You are mentioned tonight in my report,

225
00:22:50,974 --> 00:22:55,911
You men from Cold Mountain have
once again been heroes for the cause,

226
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:59,779
There are Yankees in that stand of trees
between us, stuck there from the retreat,

227
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:05,652
If they stay there, tomorrow mornin'
they can shoot us down for sport..

228
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:10,817
Go around,

229
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:15,160
- (yells)
- (Yankee) It's a Reb!

230
00:23:15,232 --> 00:23:16,563
(Yankee #2) How many of them are there?

231
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,100
(Yankee) I think there's five,

232
00:23:18,168 --> 00:23:21,069
(Confederate) Under the trees,

233
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,131
- (Confederate) We got 'em,
- (lnman) Let's go, let's go,

234
00:23:25,209 --> 00:23:27,769
(Confederate) Butcher's down,

235
00:23:28,812 --> 00:23:33,010
(lnman) Leave him, leave him,
He's gone, Let's go,

236
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:37,251
(lnman) Go, go! Go! Run!

237
00:23:38,489 --> 00:23:42,391
- Go! Go! Go!
- (Confederate #2) Hold your fire!

238
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:44,586
(Confederate #3)
What's over by them trees?

239
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:47,289
(lnman) It's us! It's us!

240
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:52,902
I said hold your fire! Hold your fire,

241
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:59,069
(wounded man screams and grunts)

242
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:02,442
(Confederate #2) Leave him, Leave him,

243
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:04,609
Agh!

244
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:34,175
(Butcher) lnman'll get it.

245
00:24:34,244 --> 00:24:39,045
Supposed to bring good luck,
a bird caught in a room,

246
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:43,678
(Monroe) I'm so sorry to have kept you
waiting, She'll just be a few seconds,

247
00:24:47,357 --> 00:24:48,915
(whistles)

248
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:55,689
(whistles)

249
00:25:48,518 --> 00:25:50,611
- Mr, lnman,
- Reverend,

250
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:53,520
- What can I do for you?
- I have some sheet music,

251
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,048
It belonged to my father,
No use to me,

252
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:58,822
Thank you,

253
00:25:58,895 --> 00:26:01,125
- You must come in,
- I should probably get along,

254
00:26:01,198 --> 00:26:04,463
Mr, lnman is more comfortable outdoors,

255
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:08,300
Perhaps we might,,,
perhaps we might take a walk,

256
00:26:08,372 --> 00:26:10,363
A splendid idea,

257
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,678
Let me just get your hat,

258
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:24,015
I dragged my poor daughter 400 miles
from Charleston to Cold Mountain

259
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:28,456
because my doctors,
they've been sayin' my chest is weak,

260
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:31,323
So the air's supposed to do me good,

261
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,729
But it's the view I think heals,

262
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,360
(lnman) It's what people say
we're fightin' for, To keep it that way,

263
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:43,463
I have no plans to preach war
in my church, Mr, lnman,

264
00:26:44,975 --> 00:26:50,709
I imagine God is weary of being called
down on both sides of an argument,

265
00:26:52,883 --> 00:26:55,351
I imagine God is,

266
00:27:01,324 --> 00:27:03,315
Thank you,

267
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:07,863
Now, your father played the piano, did he?

268
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:10,126
That's right, He was a teacher,

269
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,634
And is your father living, Mr, lnman?

270
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:14,933
- He is not,
- And your mother?

271
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:18,270
No, sir, She died when I was born,

272
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,728
(choir singing "I'm Going Home")

273
00:27:46,136 --> 00:27:48,764
Farewell, vain world

274
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,830
I'm going home

275
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:55,105
My savior smiles and bids me come

276
00:27:55,212 --> 00:27:58,739
And I don't care to stay here long

277
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:03,377
Sweet angels beckon me away

278
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:07,787
To sing God's praise in endless day

279
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:11,157
And I don't care to stay here long

280
00:28:11,228 --> 00:28:15,028
Right up yonder, Christians

281
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:18,727
- Secession,
- North Carolina left the Union,

282
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:24,832
O, yes, my Lord,
for I don't care to stay here long

283
00:28:24,941 --> 00:28:25,965
Whoo!

284
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:28,544
- We got our war!
- Whoo-hoo!

285
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:31,113
¡Ó... that I am born to die

286
00:28:31,214 --> 00:28:35,878
From grief and woe my soul shall fly

287
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:39,319
And I don't care to stay here long

288
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:44,452
Bright angels shall convey me home

289
00:28:44,528 --> 00:28:48,760
Away to New Jerusalem

290
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:54,202
And I don't care to stay here long

291
00:28:55,639 --> 00:29:00,235
We got our war! We got it!
We got it! It's about time,

292
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:02,311
Whoo!

293
00:29:04,447 --> 00:29:06,915
- All right!
- (man) lnman! Inman!

294
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:09,508
Ready to fight, son, ready to fight,

295
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:10,678
Whoo!

296
00:29:10,754 --> 00:29:13,154
We got our war, man,

297
00:29:13,223 --> 00:29:15,714
Well, you have your war,

298
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,054
Ada,

299
00:29:19,062 --> 00:29:20,893
Ada,

300
00:29:22,032 --> 00:29:25,001
It's a great day for North Carolina,

301
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:29,095
Those who follow Lincoln
or preach abolition,,,

302
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:32,233
you best keep one eye open
when you're sleepin',

303
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:35,505
Ol' boogeyman might get you,

304
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:38,911
Are you the law all of a sudden,
Mr, Teague?

305
00:29:38,982 --> 00:29:41,143
That's right, son,

306
00:29:41,218 --> 00:29:45,211
Home Guard for Haywood County,
And I'm the law from today,

307
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:50,225
Y'all go fight now,
We'll watch over your sweethearts,

308
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:52,557
(man) Hey, Teague,
Why ain't you fightin'?

309
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:55,257
'Cause he's too old,

310
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:57,596
- Yeah!
- (whooping)

311
00:29:57,667 --> 00:29:59,430
Whoo!

312
00:30:00,437 --> 00:30:03,497
You might be safer back in Charleston,

313
00:30:07,444 --> 00:30:11,642
- But then who'll be waiting for you?
- Three cheers for North Carolina!

314
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:13,876
- All right,
- Three cheers for the South!

315
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,247
Hip hip hurrah!

316
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:17,553
Hip hip hurrah!

317
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:20,015
Hip hip hurrah!

318
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:34,602
Inman, It belongs to lnman,

319
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:37,003
I got it, He's here,

320
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:46,477
They found that book
you been worryin' about, soldier,

321
00:31:25,922 --> 00:31:27,685
Wait,

322
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,468
I found you this book to take with you,

323
00:31:41,538 --> 00:31:43,699
William Bartram,

324
00:31:45,108 --> 00:31:47,576
They tell me it's good,

325
00:31:48,511 --> 00:31:52,709
I think he writes about these parts,
the author, so,,,

326
00:31:53,717 --> 00:31:55,708
Thank you,

327
00:31:57,253 --> 00:31:59,187
And this,

328
00:32:07,397 --> 00:32:09,957
I'm not smiling in it,

329
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:15,567
I don't know how to do that,

330
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:17,629
hold a smile,

331
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:20,642
(brass band plays march)

332
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:41,156
(Ada sighs)

333
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:43,222
- Ada,
- What?

334
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:04,714
(footsteps and men's voices)

335
00:33:05,922 --> 00:33:08,413
- Whoa!
- He'll be back in a month,

336
00:33:11,094 --> 00:33:13,426
Kiss her for me,

337
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:22,929
Come on, let's go,

338
00:33:28,144 --> 00:33:31,045
I'll be waiting for you,

339
00:34:06,616 --> 00:34:08,083
(Teague) Lookin' good, Butcher,

340
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:10,517
(man) Bring home
some Yankee scalps, Swimmer,

341
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:12,418
Yee-haw!

342
00:34:16,993 --> 00:34:22,158
(man) Look out the window, ladies.
See what these poor fools are dyin' for.

343
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:26,430
How many would still lose a leg
for the rich man's slave?

344
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:32,834
Most of these soldiers'll be dead by
morning, or if they're stubborn, by nightfall,

345
00:34:32,942 --> 00:34:37,538
I've other men outside
in the courtyard waitin' for beds,

346
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:40,275
so any kind word will be a blessin',

347
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,181
(coughs)

348
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:46,380
It's the heat, I'm sorry, They rot,

349
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:48,981
Pigeon River,,,

350
00:34:49,058 --> 00:34:51,754
(doctor) How are you, son?

351
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:54,820
Cold,,, Mountain,,,

352
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,532
I-I'm sorry,

353
00:34:59,602 --> 00:35:03,971
- You want water?
- Cold,,, Mountain,

354
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:08,174
Cold Mountain?

355
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,813
Cold Mountain,

356
00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:20,122
Do you worry when there's no word
from him? From Mr, lnman?

357
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:23,589
Yes,

358
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:28,591
But then I've tried countin'
the number of words

359
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:33,602
which have passed between Mr, lnman
and me - not very many,

360
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:37,902
But I think about him, Daddy, all the time,

361
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:42,205
I lost your mother
after 22 months of marriage,

362
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:46,615
It was enough to fill a life,

363
00:35:52,822 --> 00:35:54,949
(Ada) That was the last of the ham,

364
00:35:55,024 --> 00:35:58,425
- (Monroe) It was delicious,
- I have to learn how to cook,

365
00:35:58,494 --> 00:36:00,860
I was thinking of saying
something in chapel,

366
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,955
Perhaps some of the womenfolk
will volunteer,

367
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:06,365
I can't have people coming here
and cooking for me,

368
00:36:08,238 --> 00:36:09,637
I so,,,

369
00:36:09,706 --> 00:36:11,298
I so regret,,,

370
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:17,710
I should have raised you less like a
companion and more like a young woman,

371
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,944
I'm sorry, Ada,
And for dragging you here,

372
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:24,009
I'm not sorry,

373
00:36:27,223 --> 00:36:30,021
I would have followed you anywhere,

374
00:36:32,462 --> 00:36:35,124
- To Mongolia,
- Mongolia,

375
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:41,566
But with no one left to work this place,
nothing to buy, nothing left to buy it with,,,

376
00:36:43,172 --> 00:36:47,131
I just don't know how we're gonna
get through another winter,

377
00:36:49,912 --> 00:36:55,680
Will you play me somethin'? Somethin'
peaceful while I look over my sermon,

378
00:36:55,752 --> 00:36:57,879
It's too damp out here,
You should come inside,

379
00:36:57,954 --> 00:36:59,649
No,

380
00:36:59,722 --> 00:37:01,883
I like it,

381
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,949
(plays soothing music)

382
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:19,531
Daddy, bring the tablecloth in,

383
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:24,613
Come inside before you drown,

384
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:31,543
(stops playing)

385
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:33,555
(thunder)

386
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:54,743
(breathes heavily)

387
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:14,557
(woman) You have a letter,

388
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,621
North Carolina,

389
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,962
It's come a long way,

390
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,172
It's not too recent,

391
00:38:26,275 --> 00:38:28,743
It's written this past winter,

392
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,481
I'm afraid I can't read who it's from,

393
00:38:38,254 --> 00:38:40,688
"Dear Mr, lnman,,,"

394
00:38:41,424 --> 00:38:47,056
(Ada) "Since you've left, time has been
measured out in bitter chapters.

395
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:49,792
"Last fall, my poor father died.

396
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:54,635
"Our farm at Black Cove is abandoned.

397
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,601
"Every house in these mountains
touched by tragedy.

398
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:08,882
"Each day the dread...
of learning who has fallen...

399
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:13,055
who will not return from this terrible war.

400
00:39:15,124 --> 00:39:18,093
"And no word from you.

401
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:20,288
"Are you alive?

402
00:39:20,363 --> 00:39:23,161
"l pray to God you are.

403
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,566
"This war is lost on the battlefield

404
00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:31,403
and is being lost twice over
by those who stayed behind. "

405
00:39:31,507 --> 00:39:34,965
He ain't comin' back, you know that,

406
00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:41,742
You must know that in your heart,

407
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:46,615
Look at me,

408
00:39:48,257 --> 00:39:50,589
- (sighs)
- Look at me,

409
00:39:55,398 --> 00:39:58,026
I'm not nothin',

410
00:40:00,236 --> 00:40:04,639
(Ada) "I'm still waiting,
as I promised I would.

411
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:11,346
"But I find myself alone
and at the end of my wits...

412
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:17,146
too embarrassed to keep taking
from those who can least afford to give. "

413
00:40:18,287 --> 00:40:21,256
Ada! It's Sally!

414
00:40:21,324 --> 00:40:22,552
Ada!

415
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:24,889
(Esco) Look at the state of this place,

416
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:28,522
- Well, set it on the porch,
- (clears throat)

417
00:40:30,032 --> 00:40:33,559
(Sally) She let them slaves go free,
and now,,,

418
00:40:33,636 --> 00:40:38,471
Poor soul, she's got nobody and nothin',
and waitin' on a ghost,

419
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:42,169
- (rooster clucks)
- (Ada gasps)

420
00:40:42,278 --> 00:40:43,768
(clucks)

421
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,771
Shoo!

422
00:40:46,883 --> 00:40:49,317
(crows)

423
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:51,353
Go away,

424
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,648
(Ada screams)

425
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:57,758
Devil!

426
00:41:01,264 --> 00:41:05,792
"My last thread of courage now
is to put my faith in you...

427
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:11,001
"and to believe I will see you again.

428
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:16,645
"So now I say to you, plain as I can...

429
00:41:18,114 --> 00:41:21,379
"if you are fighting, stop fighting.

430
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:25,985
"lf you are marching, stop marching.

431
00:41:28,024 --> 00:41:30,515
"Come back to me,

432
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:36,395
Come back to me is my request,"

433
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,202
(Ada whispers) "Come back to me.

434
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:52,147
Come back to me is my request. "

435
00:41:54,617 --> 00:41:58,576
(man) Wounded men, don't stray
from the hospital grounds,

436
00:41:59,155 --> 00:42:01,146
(man) Hey!

437
00:42:03,025 --> 00:42:04,515
(man #2) If they send us back to fight,,,

438
00:42:04,594 --> 00:42:08,530
(man) Hey, get your peanuts now,
from the blind man,

439
00:42:09,966 --> 00:42:13,424
- Hey, your hot goobers here,
- (man #3) It's a sad day,

440
00:42:17,373 --> 00:42:20,206
Gettin' better, soldier?

441
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:23,005
Seems that way,

442
00:42:23,112 --> 00:42:25,080
I wouldn't hurry,

443
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:29,208
The war's almost done,
Don't need your help to lose it,

444
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:30,343
(chuckles)

445
00:42:30,419 --> 00:42:35,482
(man) You got ten minutes now, boys, Ten
minutes to get your haircuts and shaves,

446
00:42:35,558 --> 00:42:38,425
I've been meanin' to ask you,
Where'd you take your wound?

447
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:40,860
(blind man) Oh, before I was born,

448
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,364
Never set eyes on a thing in this world,

449
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:48,927
Not a tree, a gun or a woman,
Put my hand on all three, though,

450
00:42:49,005 --> 00:42:50,632
(laughs)

451
00:42:50,706 --> 00:42:53,504
- What would you give for that?
- Hm?

452
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:58,012
- To have your eyeballs for ten minutes,
- Ten minutes?

453
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,605
I wouldn't give an lndian head cent,

454
00:43:00,683 --> 00:43:04,710
- Might turn me hateful,
- That's sure what seein's done to me,

455
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:07,722
No, that's not the way I meant it,

456
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,350
You said ten minutes,

457
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:14,863
It's havin' a thing and then
the loss of it I'm talking about,

458
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:20,596
Then we don't agree, There's not much l
wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace,

459
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:24,766
Yeah, someplace,,, or someone,

460
00:43:27,843 --> 00:43:30,812
You watch yourself, now,

461
00:43:30,913 --> 00:43:33,905
They're shootin' men
who take themselves a walk,

462
00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:36,548
(grunts)

463
00:44:12,755 --> 00:44:15,815
(man) By order of Zebulon Vance,

464
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:18,792
governor of this great state
of North Carolina,

465
00:44:19,428 --> 00:44:24,593
any soldier turned deserter
is guilty of treason,

466
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:27,568
and should be hunted down like a dog,

467
00:44:28,938 --> 00:44:34,342
Any man who takes in a deserter
is likewise guilty of treason,

468
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:40,747
The Home Guard is powered to enter any
place it sees fit without notice or constraint,

469
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:44,720
Captain Teague needs more volunteers,

470
00:44:44,787 --> 00:44:48,985
Any man whose age or infirmity
prevents him from fightin' shall join us

471
00:44:49,058 --> 00:44:53,654
to protect this county from Yankee raiders
and traitors to the cause,

472
00:44:53,729 --> 00:44:55,526
- Is there a letter for me?
- Nothin',

473
00:44:55,598 --> 00:45:00,467
We've been gettin' no post through at all,
The sooner we lose this war the better,

474
00:45:00,536 --> 00:45:03,767
They say not one boy in ten
is comin' home to these mountains,

475
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,970
Teague and his rabble throwin' their weight
around, They're worse than the Yankees,

476
00:45:09,078 --> 00:45:11,706
Might I speak with you, please?

477
00:45:13,315 --> 00:45:15,875
This was the Reverend Monroe's,

478
00:45:18,621 --> 00:45:21,419
I don't knowwho would want a watch,

479
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:25,719
Who can bear to look at the time?

480
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:32,294
I've got a little salt pork you can have,

481
00:45:34,003 --> 00:45:36,403
Keep your daddy's watch,

482
00:45:38,073 --> 00:45:40,439
Thank you,

483
00:45:42,344 --> 00:45:44,141
I was talkin' to some of the other womenfolk

484
00:45:44,213 --> 00:45:46,977
about maybe lookin' in on you
at Black Cove, It's hard right now, but,,,

485
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:50,917
Oh, no, I manage very well,
whatever the talk is,

486
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:55,780
I'm very grateful for the pork,

487
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,323
Which I intend to pay for, of course,

488
00:46:09,905 --> 00:46:12,601
Is everything all right?

489
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:14,505
Mm-hmm,

490
00:46:29,258 --> 00:46:31,055
(Sally) Ada,

491
00:46:31,126 --> 00:46:32,957
Ada,

492
00:46:34,897 --> 00:46:38,458
Why, Ada, you are skinny
as a whippet, girl,

493
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:41,992
- You are comin' indoors with me,
- No, I can't,

494
00:46:42,071 --> 00:46:44,062
I don't,,,

495
00:46:45,307 --> 00:46:47,400
I can't keep countin' on your kindness,

496
00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:49,534
Now, come on, I'm makin' a stew,

497
00:46:49,645 --> 00:46:54,548
We'd be proud to have you,
Esco's gonna be wantin' his dinner,

498
00:46:55,851 --> 00:46:59,287
(Esco) I just wanna stop, I tell you, Yeah,

499
00:46:59,355 --> 00:47:03,792
Sit on the porch with Sal,
watch my boys in the fields,

500
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:07,795
holler "Good job" every hour or so,

501
00:47:07,863 --> 00:47:11,629
That'll be a good day,
when our boys get home,

502
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,760
What about your people in Charleston?

503
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:20,470
There are no people,

504
00:47:20,576 --> 00:47:23,238
And there's no money,

505
00:47:23,345 --> 00:47:27,338
My father had some bonds
and investments,

506
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:31,112
They're worthless now, of course,
The war,,,

507
00:47:32,688 --> 00:47:37,591
They're not worth anything,
I don't have anywhere else to go,

508
00:47:43,265 --> 00:47:45,529
I don't wanna go,

509
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,730
- You're waiting on a feller,
- (Sally) Oh!

510
00:47:53,742 --> 00:47:55,801
- Look down our well,,,
- Esco,,,

511
00:47:55,911 --> 00:47:57,879
She should,

512
00:47:58,681 --> 00:48:03,983
If you look down our well with a mirror,
you'll see the future, It's what they say,

513
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:08,251
You do it,
She does it,

514
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,254
What kind of mirror?

515
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:17,160
- We'll hold on to you, Esco, you hold on,
- I got her,

516
00:48:17,232 --> 00:48:19,723
- (Sally) We got you,
- Mm,

517
00:48:21,303 --> 00:48:23,294
See anything?

518
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:26,901
Uh,,,

519
00:48:27,576 --> 00:48:29,134
Uh,,,

520
00:48:29,244 --> 00:48:32,213
- I don't know,
- (Sally) I tried many a time,

521
00:48:32,314 --> 00:48:35,613
Iookin' for a sign
my boys were comin' home,

522
00:48:35,684 --> 00:48:38,084
I never saw a dickey bird,

523
00:48:53,168 --> 00:48:56,069
- Oh!
- (Sally) Are you all right? Ada?

524
00:48:56,138 --> 00:48:59,073
What? What happened?

525
00:49:00,843 --> 00:49:03,505
What'd you see? What'd you see?

526
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,913
"Yesterday,
I saw you walkin' back to me...

527
00:49:08,717 --> 00:49:11,049
"or thought I did.

528
00:49:11,987 --> 00:49:16,424
"l found myself crouching
over Sally Swanger's well...

529
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,350
(crows)

530
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:25,297
"... Iike a madwoman
staring into its secrets.

531
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:32,932
"Was it you I saw walking home to me,
or was it your ghost?

532
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:37,172
"After so long, I know I must learn
to survive on my own

533
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,407
"and accept you will not return.

534
00:49:40,482 --> 00:49:43,883
And yet I cannot. I cannot. "

535
00:49:46,021 --> 00:49:47,010
(sighs)

536
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:49,455
(cows mooing)

537
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:51,755
Them cows wants milkin',

538
00:49:51,827 --> 00:49:55,092
If that letter ain't urgent,
them cows is is what I'm sayin',

539
00:49:55,164 --> 00:49:57,189
I don't know you,

540
00:49:57,266 --> 00:50:00,463
Old lady Swanger says you need help,

541
00:50:00,536 --> 00:50:03,437
Here I am,

542
00:50:03,505 --> 00:50:08,442
I,,, I need help but,,, I need,,,
I do need help, but I need a laborer,

543
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:13,504
There's,,, there's plowing and rough work,
I think there's been a misunderstanding,

544
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:16,482
What's that rake for?

545
00:50:16,552 --> 00:50:19,316
- The rake?
- Well, it ain't for gardenin', that's for sure,

546
00:50:19,388 --> 00:50:23,017
Number one, you got a horse?
I can plow all day, I'm a worker,

547
00:50:23,092 --> 00:50:25,526
Number two, ain't no man better'n me,

548
00:50:25,594 --> 00:50:29,860
'cause there ain't no man around
who ain't old or full of mischief,

549
00:50:31,266 --> 00:50:34,861
- I know your plight,
- My plight?

550
00:50:34,937 --> 00:50:38,464
Am I hard to hear?
'Cause you keep repeatin' everything,

551
00:50:38,574 --> 00:50:42,169
I ain't lookin' for money, I never cared for it
and now it ain't worth nothin',

552
00:50:42,277 --> 00:50:45,508
I expect to board and eat,
at the same table,

553
00:50:45,581 --> 00:50:48,744
- I ain't a servant, if you get my meanin',
- You're not a servant,

554
00:50:48,817 --> 00:50:53,516
People's gonna have to empty
their own night jars is my point,

555
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:56,456
And I don't expect to work
whilst you sit around and watch, neither,

556
00:50:56,525 --> 00:50:57,651
Right,

557
00:50:57,726 --> 00:51:00,559
Right, Is that a yes or a no?

558
00:51:00,629 --> 00:51:03,029
(rooster crows)

559
00:51:03,098 --> 00:51:06,158
There's a rooster,
He's the devil, I'm sure of it,

560
00:51:06,235 --> 00:51:08,795
I go near him
and he is at me with his spurs,

561
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:11,066
He's Lucifer himself,

562
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,473
- I despise a floggin' rooster,
- (crows)

563
00:51:15,444 --> 00:51:17,412
Oh, no, I wouldn't,,,

564
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:20,482
My name's Ruby Thewes,
I know your name,

565
00:51:24,253 --> 00:51:27,086
- (rooster squawks)
- (neck snaps)

566
00:51:27,156 --> 00:51:28,623
(gasps)

567
00:51:29,925 --> 00:51:32,416
Let's put him in a pot,

568
00:51:33,629 --> 00:51:36,325
("You Will Be My Ain True Love")

569
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:40,066
Mm-hm-hm-hm

570
00:51:40,402 --> 00:51:44,498
Mm-hm-hm-hm

571
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:47,637
Mm-hm-hm-hm

572
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:52,276
Mm-hm-hm-hm

573
00:51:54,883 --> 00:51:56,544
(grunts)

574
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,183
Urgh!

575
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,860
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm

576
00:52:03,936 --> 00:52:07,599
Mm-hm-hm-hm-hm

577
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:15,113
I've gone to find my ain true love

578
00:52:35,668 --> 00:52:40,071
(man) You're my angel, my butterfly,

579
00:52:41,473 --> 00:52:43,964
Come fly away,

580
00:52:44,043 --> 00:52:46,671
(groans)

581
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:49,680
My love,,,

582
00:52:49,748 --> 00:52:52,740
God forgive me for doin' this,

583
00:52:52,818 --> 00:52:55,048
I'm so sorry,

584
00:52:55,154 --> 00:52:57,918
I'm sendin' you to a better place,

585
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:59,787
(groans)

586
00:52:59,858 --> 00:53:02,793
You go fly away,

587
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:04,761
Hey!

588
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:09,893
- Don't do that,
- Don't pull that trigger, I'm a man of God,

589
00:53:09,968 --> 00:53:14,496
- I killed several of them,
- I mean I'm God's minister,

590
00:53:14,573 --> 00:53:18,600
What part of God's business
is throwin' a woman down a gorge?

591
00:53:18,677 --> 00:53:20,975
A slave woman,

592
00:53:21,046 --> 00:53:24,846
Can you see that in this light?
Black as a bucket of tar,

593
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:27,886
- Is she dead?
- No, I drugged her,

594
00:53:27,953 --> 00:53:30,183
Iike you would a butterfly,

595
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:33,258
And I care for her,
That's the heartbreak of it,

596
00:53:33,992 --> 00:53:36,984
She's got my bastard in her belly,

597
00:53:37,062 --> 00:53:39,530
Come on, Back up,

598
00:53:39,598 --> 00:53:41,691
(wheezes)

599
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:44,258
- I'm beggin' you,
- Git,

600
00:53:44,336 --> 00:53:50,002
It's better you blow out my brains
than return me to this place,

601
00:53:50,909 --> 00:53:54,003
You're gonna put her back
where she sleeps,

602
00:53:55,114 --> 00:53:58,277
I do that, the members will lynch me

603
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:02,844
for sirin' a bastard while servin' as
their preacher, We're a strict congregation,

604
00:54:02,955 --> 00:54:06,652
We've churched men
for pickin' up a fiddle on the Sabbath,

605
00:54:06,725 --> 00:54:09,626
So you reckon to kill her?
What, because she's a slave?

606
00:54:09,695 --> 00:54:12,061
(breathes heavily)

607
00:54:12,131 --> 00:54:13,860
I,,, um,,,

608
00:54:13,932 --> 00:54:16,332
There's a back door, Have pity,

609
00:54:18,604 --> 00:54:20,834
Thank you,

610
00:54:20,906 --> 00:54:23,568
I was gonna do a grievous wrong,

611
00:54:26,245 --> 00:54:29,146
I think I should go back up to my wife,

612
00:54:30,749 --> 00:54:32,842
She wakes at the slightest noise,

613
00:54:32,951 --> 00:54:34,885
Agh! Ohh,,,

614
00:54:34,953 --> 00:54:36,944
Where's some paper and a pencil?

615
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,387
(tries to speak)

616
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:44,595
(tries to shout)

617
00:54:48,066 --> 00:54:51,729
- (knock at door)
- (Ruby) Hey, Ada! You up?

618
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,770
- Yes,
- (knocking)

619
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,365
Wha,,,? It's still dark,

620
00:54:57,443 --> 00:55:00,173
Tell that to the cows, It's late,

621
00:55:07,085 --> 00:55:09,383
You all set?

622
00:55:09,488 --> 00:55:11,547
Oh, l-I just have to eat somethin',

623
00:55:11,657 --> 00:55:14,626
Well, then, you got to get up earlier,
What's that?

624
00:55:16,628 --> 00:55:18,892
A novel,

625
00:55:18,964 --> 00:55:22,297
You wanna carry a book,
carry one you can write in,

626
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:29,970
We got our own story,
It's called Black Cove Farm: Catastrophe.

627
00:55:31,043 --> 00:55:35,503
I can spell it, too, Learned it the same place
you did, in the schoolhouse,

628
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:38,141
One of the first words they taught me,

629
00:55:38,217 --> 00:55:43,655
"Ruby Thewes,
you are a c-a-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h-e,"

630
00:55:43,722 --> 00:55:46,418
Three years I was in school,
before my daddy,,,

631
00:55:46,492 --> 00:55:49,859
Sayin' God rest his soul is like
wishin' him what he had in life,

632
00:55:49,928 --> 00:55:52,761
He lived to rest, He was born tired,

633
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,322
He decided,,, better use for me

634
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,166
than havin' me sat all day
in front of a chalkboard,

635
00:56:01,373 --> 00:56:03,705
(grunts)

636
00:56:03,775 --> 00:56:05,868
(groans)

637
00:56:06,512 --> 00:56:11,950
Number one, lay out a winter garden
for cool-season crops,

638
00:56:12,017 --> 00:56:15,544
Turnips right there, onions, cabbage,

639
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,050
Collards,

640
00:56:19,157 --> 00:56:22,786
Number two,
patch the shingles on the barn roof,

641
00:56:22,861 --> 00:56:25,159
Have we got a maul and frow?

642
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:29,098
- Maul?
- Maul, M-a-u-l,

643
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:32,364
Number three, clear and turn this field,

644
00:56:39,211 --> 00:56:42,806
No harm done lettin' it go,
Now we'll do well,

645
00:56:43,649 --> 00:56:44,741
Number 1 5,,,

646
00:56:44,816 --> 00:56:45,714
1 8,

647
00:56:45,817 --> 00:56:47,216
- Number 1 6,,,
- Number 1 6,,,

648
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:51,779
Put up some gourds for a martin colony,
Keep away these crows,

649
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:56,987
One thing in abundance on this farm,
and that's crows, Shut the gate,

650
00:56:57,029 --> 00:56:59,156
(caws)

651
00:57:40,238 --> 00:57:42,900
I'd pay a dollar for an egg,

652
00:57:43,976 --> 00:57:46,570
I've got no quarrel with you,

653
00:57:46,645 --> 00:57:48,112
Hey!

654
00:57:49,081 --> 00:57:52,073
Am I near the Cape Fear River?

655
00:58:24,016 --> 00:58:27,076
- (man) Home Guard! Get back there!
- (gunfire/horses neighing)

656
00:58:27,185 --> 00:58:28,846
- (man #2) Runaways!
- (gunfire/shouting)

657
00:58:28,954 --> 00:58:31,445
(gunfire and shouting)

658
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:36,327
(man) Come on, boys!

659
00:58:37,629 --> 00:58:39,324
(man #2) Let's get 'em!

660
00:58:39,398 --> 00:58:42,231
(man #3) They're spreadin' out in the field!

661
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:48,465
- (man #2) Come back here!
- (man #3) They're in the field,

662
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,031
(man #2) They're in the field!

663
00:58:56,948 --> 00:58:58,779
(grunts)

664
00:59:00,852 --> 00:59:03,218
(man) I can get you outta here,

665
00:59:08,794 --> 00:59:11,922
I daresay that's Home Guard followin' you,

666
00:59:11,997 --> 00:59:15,831
They're out on the road,
huntin' down deserters,

667
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:18,233
And I don't recommend that way,

668
00:59:18,303 --> 00:59:22,103
You'll meet half the town comin' after me
with a noose, thanks to you,

669
00:59:22,174 --> 00:59:24,972
I should have shot you
when I had the chance,

670
00:59:25,043 --> 00:59:29,480
I know where there's a ferry crossin',
Or you can stubborn yourself to death,

671
00:59:30,916 --> 00:59:36,445
- (lnman) If this is a trap,,,
- Please yourself, I'm just bein' a Christian,

672
00:59:36,555 --> 00:59:39,115
- You got any money?
- (man) $5,

673
00:59:39,224 --> 00:59:42,819
For $5 I wouldn't give a parched man
a dipper of this river water,

674
00:59:42,894 --> 00:59:45,021
The sign says "Ferry $5,"

675
00:59:45,097 --> 00:59:50,057
Nobody crosses these waters
unless they're runnin' from someplace,

676
00:59:50,969 --> 00:59:53,437
You wanna wait for your friends?

677
00:59:53,505 --> 00:59:55,700
I can give you $30 Confederate,

678
00:59:55,774 --> 00:59:58,106
Well, all right, let's go,

679
00:59:58,176 --> 01:00:00,167
Whatever that's worth,

680
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,175
They cut off my hair,

681
01:00:08,553 --> 01:00:11,181
That was hard,

682
01:00:11,289 --> 01:00:13,348
I was vain about my hair,

683
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:16,650
I had curls,

684
01:00:17,295 --> 01:00:20,128
But I deserved it,

685
01:00:20,198 --> 01:00:25,033
I'm the Reverend Veasey,
Have I seen you in church?

686
01:00:25,103 --> 01:00:27,936
No, Not likely to, neither,

687
01:00:28,006 --> 01:00:32,306
I'd say these days, the devil rules the roost,

688
01:00:35,147 --> 01:00:37,445
30 more dollars,
we can go over to that cabin

689
01:00:37,516 --> 01:00:40,644
and I can pull this dress over my head,

690
01:00:42,888 --> 01:00:45,254
Have we got $30?

691
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:47,086
(gunshot)

692
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:51,027
- Get down!
- (soldier) I got one,

693
01:00:59,237 --> 01:01:03,264
- Is there any other way to cross?
- Barge or boat, The water's full of gators,

694
01:01:04,709 --> 01:01:06,734
(Ruby) What's this wood?

695
01:01:06,812 --> 01:01:09,303
- I don't know,
- ln,

696
01:01:10,148 --> 01:01:11,638
- I don't know,
- Pine,

697
01:01:11,716 --> 01:01:15,208
- Locust?
- Pine, Where's north?

698
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,312
North? Uh,,,

699
01:01:19,357 --> 01:01:22,053
Name me three herbs
that grow wild on this farm,

700
01:01:22,127 --> 01:01:24,595
I can't, I can't, all right?

701
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:29,298
I can talk about farming in Latin,

702
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:32,996
I can,,, I can read French,

703
01:01:33,071 --> 01:01:35,938
I know how to lace up a corset,
God knows,

704
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:38,134
I can name the principal rivers in Europe,

705
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:41,771
Just don't ask me
to name one stream in this county!

706
01:01:41,847 --> 01:01:44,941
I can,,, I can embroider
but I can't darn!

707
01:01:45,016 --> 01:01:49,077
I can arrange cut flowers
but I can't grow them!

708
01:01:51,423 --> 01:01:54,358
If a thing has a function,
if I might do something with it,

709
01:01:54,426 --> 01:01:57,862
then it wasn't considered suitable!

710
01:02:00,065 --> 01:02:02,056
Why?

711
01:02:04,202 --> 01:02:07,694
Ruby, you can ask why about
pretty much everything to do with me,

712
01:02:11,576 --> 01:02:15,979
This fence is about the first thing
that I've ever done

713
01:02:16,047 --> 01:02:19,016
that might produce an actual result,

714
01:02:24,422 --> 01:02:26,390
(panting)

715
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:33,424
So you never wrapped your legs
around this lnman?

716
01:02:34,299 --> 01:02:36,267
Oh!

717
01:02:39,738 --> 01:02:41,729
Come on,

718
01:02:45,777 --> 01:02:47,768
(Ada playing piano)

719
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:25,238
(pig squeals)

720
01:03:26,685 --> 01:03:28,380
Fine piano,

721
01:03:30,422 --> 01:03:31,389
(sighs)

722
01:03:34,826 --> 01:03:36,794
(grunts)

723
01:03:43,101 --> 01:03:45,092
(sighs)

724
01:03:54,145 --> 01:03:57,911
If we're careful,
now we'll get through winter,

725
01:03:57,983 --> 01:04:00,417
I got old man Roy
to give me ten of them sheep,

726
01:04:00,518 --> 01:04:02,509
on account of I said they's so small,

727
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:06,386
put together they weren't no bigger
than six proper sheep,

728
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:09,655
My father
always wanted sheep on this farm,

729
01:04:12,998 --> 01:04:15,626
I cut off my hair once for money,

730
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:21,570
My daddy got $2 for it,
Made a wig for some rich feller in Raleigh,

731
01:04:23,675 --> 01:04:27,076
I'm just sayin'
I'm real sorry you had to lose your piano,

732
01:04:27,145 --> 01:04:29,113
Ruby, it was my idea,

733
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:32,274
Stobrod liked to call himself a musician,

734
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:36,912
My daddy,
He could play six tunes on a fiddle,

735
01:04:37,022 --> 01:04:40,514
Got hisself shot dead at Petersburg,

736
01:04:41,493 --> 01:04:44,121
I was like his goat,

737
01:04:44,195 --> 01:04:46,663
Or some critter tethered to a post,

738
01:04:50,502 --> 01:04:53,471
He left me once,
Up in them mountains,

739
01:04:53,538 --> 01:04:56,006
I was eight,
He was gone over two and a half weeks,

740
01:04:56,074 --> 01:04:58,406
He left you?

741
01:05:00,745 --> 01:05:03,942
Uh-huh, I was all right,

742
01:05:04,015 --> 01:05:09,817
My daddy, he'd walk 40 miles for liquor
and not 40 inches for kindness,

743
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,586
(Veasey) I'm so plugged up,

744
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:18,425
Used to be as regular as morning prayers,

745
01:05:18,496 --> 01:05:22,159
Matter of fact,
I could set my watch by my bowels,

746
01:05:23,668 --> 01:05:30,369
Open my gut now, they'd find turds
stacked up like little black twigs,

747
01:05:31,776 --> 01:05:33,767
(whispers) Home Guard!

748
01:05:33,845 --> 01:05:35,836
(Home Guard riders yelling)

749
01:05:47,725 --> 01:05:49,659
- Hey,
- Shh,

750
01:05:49,727 --> 01:05:52,696
- Look at this,
- Keep your voice down,

751
01:05:53,932 --> 01:05:55,923
Look at this!

752
01:05:57,836 --> 01:06:00,498
- It's a good saw!
- And it's not yours,

753
01:06:01,706 --> 01:06:05,767
You're a Christian,
Don't you know your Commandments?

754
01:06:06,778 --> 01:06:11,738
You'll find the good Lord
very flexible on the subject of property,

755
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:15,480
We could do a lot with this saw,

756
01:06:15,587 --> 01:06:19,648
Cut down a tree,
Play music with it,

757
01:06:21,192 --> 01:06:23,524
You're gonna thank me for this saw,

758
01:06:23,595 --> 01:06:27,429
I'll say thank you when I've lost you
and I've found some food,

759
01:06:27,499 --> 01:06:29,729
You'll see,
You'll thank me,

760
01:06:41,146 --> 01:06:43,080
Shh,

761
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:49,744
Good day to you,

762
01:06:56,628 --> 01:07:01,964
My old bull,,, wandered off,,,
and died in this here creek,

763
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:05,560
Poisonin' up ourwater
is how I found him,

764
01:07:08,673 --> 01:07:11,506
Thank you,
You are a true Christian,

765
01:07:13,011 --> 01:07:17,641
- That's a rank odor from that animal,
- Been dead a good while, I reckon,

766
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:21,074
- This is a tricky one,
- (sniffs)

767
01:07:23,555 --> 01:07:27,514
You fellers help me out,
my woman'll cook you up a good dinner,

768
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:29,923
I'm gettin' an idea,

769
01:07:31,429 --> 01:07:33,624
My saw's the remedy,

770
01:07:33,698 --> 01:07:37,293
I believe you need two people,
one on either end,

771
01:07:37,368 --> 01:07:38,858
Yeah,

772
01:07:38,937 --> 01:07:40,928
Give me that saw,

773
01:07:46,844 --> 01:07:48,311
Let's do this in chapters,

774
01:07:48,379 --> 01:07:50,006
- That's right,
- Yeah,

775
01:07:50,081 --> 01:07:52,879
Start at the neck,

776
01:07:53,384 --> 01:07:55,352
Aw,,,!

777
01:07:55,453 --> 01:07:57,421
(sawing)

778
01:07:57,989 --> 01:08:00,549
Oh, well,,, That is unpleasant,

779
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,628
(farmer) There's my place,

780
01:08:04,696 --> 01:08:08,291
Hope you can stomach
a yard chock full of female,

781
01:08:08,366 --> 01:08:11,335
Oh, God, Oh, my God,

782
01:08:11,402 --> 01:08:12,994
Hallelujah,

783
01:08:13,071 --> 01:08:18,065
Hallelujah! Oh, hallelujah!
The lsraelites!

784
01:08:18,142 --> 01:08:19,734
(farmer) What happened?

785
01:08:19,811 --> 01:08:21,972
He's got a shit comin',
It's overdue,

786
01:08:22,046 --> 01:08:27,848
The tribes of lsrael are about to flee
from the banks of Egypt!

787
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,617
Good God,

788
01:08:30,722 --> 01:08:33,520
These boys are stoppin' for supper!

789
01:08:39,564 --> 01:08:41,088
Brought my woman home,

790
01:08:41,165 --> 01:08:45,659
she showed up with her three sisters,
so-called, and their brats,

791
01:08:45,737 --> 01:08:48,035
That's Mae, Dolly, Shyla,

792
01:08:48,106 --> 01:08:50,939
and the pretty one in blue is my wife, Lila,

793
01:08:53,378 --> 01:08:55,676
Those are fine examples of the female,

794
01:09:00,151 --> 01:09:02,142
(squawking)

795
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:15,222
- Oh, I'm about to pass out,
- (laughter)

796
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:20,795
(farmer) My home brew sneaks up on you,
It curdles your durdles,

797
01:09:20,872 --> 01:09:23,397
Oh, Oh, look, He's gone now,

798
01:09:23,474 --> 01:09:25,465
Look, He's gone now,

799
01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:28,504
His eyes, they've gone,

800
01:09:28,579 --> 01:09:31,377
- His eyes are gone,
- What?

801
01:09:31,449 --> 01:09:35,510
- (woman) Gone, gone, gone, gone!
- (laughter)

802
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:43,049
I'm leavin' soon as I'm full,
Y'all havin' too much fun for me,

803
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:44,992
Really? Goodbye,

804
01:09:45,063 --> 01:09:48,692
Well, yeah,
I got a bunch of traps need visitin',

805
01:09:48,766 --> 01:09:52,395
but I'll be back before,,,
before dark tomorrow,

806
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:56,099
- Y'all still be here?
- That's my fervent prayer,

807
01:09:56,174 --> 01:10:00,008
I'll say my goodbyes,
I gotta go,

808
01:10:00,078 --> 01:10:06,745
I got miles and miles and miles and miles
ahead of me before I reach the Blue Ridge,

809
01:10:06,818 --> 01:10:09,048
Blue Ridge? What's the hurry?

810
01:10:09,153 --> 01:10:12,589
- Maybe I will just lie down a moment,
- Yeah,

811
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:17,286
- This house is on a bit of a tilt,
- Yeah, it is a bit crooked,

812
01:10:17,362 --> 01:10:19,159
(giggling)

813
01:10:21,399 --> 01:10:23,060
Lie down,

814
01:10:23,134 --> 01:10:25,125
What about you, Reverend?

815
01:10:26,704 --> 01:10:29,730
I'm headin' for that smokehouse,

816
01:10:29,807 --> 01:10:32,139
And I'm ready
to be washed clean of my dirt,

817
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:35,270
- Yeah, Mae, you go tend to him,
- Mm-hm,

818
01:10:35,346 --> 01:10:36,335
All right,

819
01:10:36,414 --> 01:10:38,974
Y'all get to bed,

820
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:41,541
Everybody else got their job,

821
01:10:41,652 --> 01:10:43,620
- Come on, get to bed,
- Now?

822
01:10:43,721 --> 01:10:47,248
Everybody to bed,
Lila, you stay with them kids,

823
01:10:47,358 --> 01:10:49,622
Get on up those stairs,

824
01:10:49,694 --> 01:10:51,559
I'll be seein' you.

825
01:10:52,296 --> 01:10:55,356
(moans) Look,,,

826
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:59,392
He's mine,
You go rub yourself off on the preacher,

827
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:03,031
I'm gonna make him hug me till I grunt,

828
01:11:03,107 --> 01:11:05,974
He's purty, ain't he?

829
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:08,971
Git,

830
01:11:09,046 --> 01:11:12,038
She ain't even supposed to get a man,

831
01:11:14,252 --> 01:11:16,220
Hey,

832
01:11:20,124 --> 01:11:22,524
(mumbles)

833
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:25,752
I know, I know,

834
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:29,322
I,,,

835
01:11:30,668 --> 01:11:32,693
How about that?

-,,,gotta go,
- Get on,

838
01:11:40,611 --> 01:11:44,945
And ride me all the way to China,

839
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,741
(moans sensually)

840
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,185
You shy?

841
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:01,953
- Do you need a hand?
- No, Uh,,,

842
01:12:02,029 --> 01:12:05,328
Let's have a look
and see what we can muster,

843
01:12:06,066 --> 01:12:09,058
Oh, no,
Look what you made me do,

844
01:12:11,271 --> 01:12:13,171
Slut!

845
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,470
Home Guard!

846
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:17,237
Cover yourself up!

847
01:12:17,311 --> 01:12:20,075
I told you, you don't touch the money!

848
01:12:20,981 --> 01:12:22,949
(moans of pleasure)

849
01:12:25,118 --> 01:12:29,054
- I had a special prayer you'd come visit,
- (Mae giggles)

850
01:12:29,156 --> 01:12:31,215
- Get up,
- (Mae) Evenin', Hank,

851
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:32,952
Evenin', Hank,

852
01:12:33,627 --> 01:12:36,721
- You took your time,
- I said get up!

853
01:12:37,998 --> 01:12:41,991
Get in line,
You fools fall for it every time,

854
01:12:43,737 --> 01:12:46,865
(Veasey) God will judge you, you Judas,

855
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:50,341
- Thanks,
- God will judge you!

856
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:55,074
- Move out!
- Our lives are on your rotten soul,

857
01:12:55,182 --> 01:12:56,979
- Mister?
- Your rotten soul!

858
01:12:57,084 --> 01:12:59,052
Shut your mouth!

859
01:13:00,954 --> 01:13:03,787
- Pleasure doin' business with you, boys,
- Judas!

860
01:13:03,857 --> 01:13:05,620
Save your breath,

861
01:13:05,692 --> 01:13:08,354
You got a long walk back to the fightin',

862
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,894
Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes,
look at you both,

863
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:18,369
Look at us both what?

864
01:13:18,438 --> 01:13:21,066
Like a couple of scarecrows
after a thunderstorm,

865
01:13:21,141 --> 01:13:25,305
We need a scarecrow,
Birds done ate up half our winter garden,

866
01:13:25,379 --> 01:13:29,315
For all your kindness, coffee,,, and a pie,

867
01:13:29,383 --> 01:13:35,015
Yeah, and that's real coffee, It ain't chicory
and dirt, Found a sack hid in the larder,

868
01:13:35,088 --> 01:13:36,055
Mmm,

869
01:13:36,156 --> 01:13:37,919
Thank you both,

870
01:13:37,991 --> 01:13:41,927
Ruby, I look forward to this,
We all do,

871
01:13:41,995 --> 01:13:43,656
Esco and me,

872
01:13:44,431 --> 01:13:47,525
- She made it,
- I made it,

873
01:13:49,136 --> 01:13:51,400
Good God in heaven,

874
01:13:51,471 --> 01:13:54,269
I'm still livin',

875
01:13:54,341 --> 01:13:58,710
Well, I know Esco's
gonna be real sorry he missed you,

876
01:14:10,257 --> 01:14:11,588
Yep,

877
01:14:16,229 --> 01:14:19,164
- Strike you as odd?
- What?

878
01:14:19,232 --> 01:14:23,692
- Stood at her front door,
- I know,

879
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:27,900
Number one, I knowed that woman
all my life, I never stood outside her house,

880
01:14:27,974 --> 01:14:31,171
She'd let a wolf in if it knocked at the door,

881
01:14:31,244 --> 01:14:33,007
Perhaps,,,

882
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:35,412
I don't know,
Perhaps she was busy,

883
01:14:35,515 --> 01:14:41,351
Number two, old man Swanger's inside
that house, I could smell his pipe burnin',

884
01:14:41,421 --> 01:14:46,017
- Number three, look at them fields,
- What about them?

885
01:14:46,093 --> 01:14:50,257
We come by here a week ago
and they was waist-high in hay,

886
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:54,562
You tellin' me
that's work for one old man and his dog?

887
01:15:02,375 --> 01:15:04,468
Yankees! Yankees!

888
01:15:04,544 --> 01:15:07,274
Cavalry! Federal raiders!

889
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:09,348
Just over that hill,

890
01:15:09,449 --> 01:15:12,418
- Get those sacks of shit up that hill,
- Come on!

891
01:15:15,922 --> 01:15:17,890
(grunting)

892
01:15:20,026 --> 01:15:24,725
Get those horses under cover,
If they see us, we're dead,

893
01:15:25,332 --> 01:15:28,233
Make a move, make a noise,,,

894
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:41,871
(horse whinnies)

895
01:16:01,968 --> 01:16:04,266
(lnman whispers) I'm gettin' out of this,

896
01:16:04,337 --> 01:16:08,740
I'm not gettin' shot again
for some cause I don't believe in,

897
01:16:08,809 --> 01:16:10,640
Come on, let's go,

898
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:12,610
Come on, They can't shoot,
Come on,

899
01:16:16,917 --> 01:16:18,782
Keep goin'! Come on!

900
01:16:18,852 --> 01:16:21,582
Bayonets,

901
01:16:22,389 --> 01:16:24,254
Come on!

902
01:16:25,559 --> 01:16:26,890
(neighing)

903
01:16:28,395 --> 01:16:29,384
(screams)

904
01:16:54,087 --> 01:16:58,581
(Yankee captain) Grab their boots
and rifles! Let's move on!

905
01:16:58,658 --> 01:17:00,626
Let's go!

906
01:17:16,109 --> 01:17:19,772
That scarecrow
ain't gonna frighten off no Yankee,

907
01:17:19,846 --> 01:17:22,781
Or are you tryin'
to make a man for yourself?

908
01:17:22,849 --> 01:17:24,339
No,

909
01:17:26,219 --> 01:17:30,315
I come by,,, a few days,

910
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,881
- I don't pass by,
- (sighs)

911
01:17:32,959 --> 01:17:36,190
- Lookin' out for you,
- I know,

912
01:17:37,931 --> 01:17:40,024
I see you,

913
01:17:41,334 --> 01:17:44,599
- And I don't like it,
- Where's your little servant girl?

914
01:17:44,671 --> 01:17:48,539
Ruby, She tradin' off
more of your daddy's silver?

915
01:17:48,608 --> 01:17:51,099
- Stop it!
- Her nose is in the butter,

916
01:17:51,177 --> 01:17:53,839
Her nose is right in your butter!

917
01:18:03,657 --> 01:18:06,125
This farm's got my name on it!

918
01:18:06,192 --> 01:18:09,855
You listenin', woman?
You're gonna need more than a scarecrow!

919
01:19:05,018 --> 01:19:07,350
(yells)

920
01:19:22,402 --> 01:19:24,393
(yells)

921
01:19:38,184 --> 01:19:40,152
Sal,

922
01:19:50,797 --> 01:19:52,788
Afternoon,

923
01:19:54,834 --> 01:19:57,496
Don't spread out,
Why are they spreadin' out?

924
01:19:58,405 --> 01:20:01,169
I never seen a man work a field
with a shotgun before,

925
01:20:01,241 --> 01:20:02,640
(Esco) There's a war on,

926
01:20:02,709 --> 01:20:04,768
Get off my land,

927
01:20:05,678 --> 01:20:09,011
- Your boys come home?
- Ain't seen my boys in four years,

928
01:20:09,115 --> 01:20:11,913
They're out fightin' other boys,
not old men and women,

929
01:20:11,985 --> 01:20:14,818
So you won't mind if we look around?

930
01:20:14,888 --> 01:20:17,152
'Cause we think they're here,

931
01:20:17,223 --> 01:20:19,919
We think you've got 'em
hid up somewhere,

932
01:20:19,993 --> 01:20:24,191
What I gotta give you?
Chicken? Lamb?

933
01:20:25,565 --> 01:20:27,260
Sure,

934
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:30,530
The thing is, you've only got one barrel,

935
01:20:30,603 --> 01:20:34,369
And there's five of us,
That's not a fair fight,

936
01:20:38,244 --> 01:20:40,178
King of kings!

937
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:41,875
Hey!

938
01:20:43,817 --> 01:20:44,784
What was that?

939
01:20:46,252 --> 01:20:48,743
Aargh!

940
01:20:48,855 --> 01:20:52,791
You're harboring deserters, I could
confiscate this farm and everything on it,

941
01:20:52,859 --> 01:20:56,056
Every plate, every sheep,
every little pellet of chickenshit,

942
01:20:56,129 --> 01:20:58,393
I could confiscate your old lady's asshole,

943
01:20:58,465 --> 01:21:00,092
So don't you offer me no bird,

944
01:21:09,109 --> 01:21:11,100
(hums)

945
01:21:17,584 --> 01:21:19,552
(whistles)

946
01:21:20,386 --> 01:21:22,786
(Sally screams)

947
01:21:22,856 --> 01:21:25,723
Come on, boys!

948
01:21:25,792 --> 01:21:27,657
Mama's callin'!

949
01:21:27,727 --> 01:21:29,888
(screams)

950
01:21:32,398 --> 01:21:33,558
(screams)

951
01:21:35,869 --> 01:21:36,927
Mama!

952
01:21:37,003 --> 01:21:39,801
No!

953
01:21:39,873 --> 01:21:42,433
Mama! Mama!

954
01:21:44,043 --> 01:21:46,034
No!

955
01:21:48,915 --> 01:21:50,439
(Sally wails)

956
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:56,555
(groaning)

957
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:02,451
(bells tinkling)

958
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:23,241
(grunting)

959
01:22:23,349 --> 01:22:26,216
Buggery and shit!

960
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:32,282
If l'da known you were this heavy,
l'da left you in those chains,

961
01:22:36,396 --> 01:22:38,387
(whimpering)

962
01:22:49,442 --> 01:22:50,670
(gasps)

963
01:22:50,743 --> 01:22:52,734
Sally!

964
01:22:53,346 --> 01:22:55,075
No!

965
01:22:55,848 --> 01:22:58,009
No!

966
01:22:58,117 --> 01:22:59,482
(straining)

967
01:22:59,552 --> 01:23:01,019
Oh, God, Sally?

968
01:23:01,087 --> 01:23:02,384
Ada!

969
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:05,881
All right, all right!

970
01:23:05,959 --> 01:23:07,859
(straining)

971
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:10,654
Darlin', what?

972
01:23:11,831 --> 01:23:14,698
She's sayin' "Don't bother"! Go!

973
01:23:14,767 --> 01:23:17,031
(grunting)

974
01:23:19,038 --> 01:23:21,063
Get her neck!

975
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:23,768
- Sally!
- Get her neck,

976
01:23:27,447 --> 01:23:30,974
This world won't stand long,

977
01:23:31,351 --> 01:23:34,286
God won't let it,,,

978
01:23:34,354 --> 01:23:37,289
stand this way long,

979
01:23:42,528 --> 01:23:48,592
- How long have I been sleepin'?
- Two days, three days, Not long enough,

980
01:23:48,668 --> 01:23:52,627
- I can't stop here,
- Sit down before you fall down,

981
01:23:52,705 --> 01:23:55,333
I'm a deserter,

982
01:23:55,408 --> 01:23:58,741
If they find me here,
things could be bad for you,

983
01:23:58,811 --> 01:24:01,336
What are they gonna do?
Cut short my young life?

984
01:24:04,784 --> 01:24:06,752
(goat bleats)

985
01:24:10,223 --> 01:24:13,920
I've learned a person
can pretty much survive off of a goat,

986
01:24:13,993 --> 01:24:16,826
A goat gives you company,

987
01:24:16,896 --> 01:24:18,693
and milk,

988
01:24:18,765 --> 01:24:20,596
and cheese,

989
01:24:20,667 --> 01:24:23,397
and, when you need it,

990
01:24:23,469 --> 01:24:25,266
good meat,

991
01:24:28,174 --> 01:24:30,165
That's my beauty,

992
01:24:30,443 --> 01:24:32,707
There's my beauty,

993
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:35,873
So you been fightin',

994
01:24:38,651 --> 01:24:41,518
I could be at killin',,,

995
01:24:41,587 --> 01:24:43,418
for days,

996
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:47,848
my feet against the feet of my enemy,

997
01:24:48,895 --> 01:24:51,227
And I always killed him,

998
01:24:54,934 --> 01:24:56,799
He never killed me,

999
01:24:56,869 --> 01:24:58,860
I don't know why,

1000
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:03,299
Gave it a try, to look at ya,

1001
01:25:05,111 --> 01:25:07,102
Yeah, I guess he did,

1002
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:08,977
See, I think there's a plan,

1003
01:25:09,082 --> 01:25:11,607
There's a design
for each and every one of us,

1004
01:25:11,718 --> 01:25:13,345
You look at nature,

1005
01:25:13,453 --> 01:25:18,117
Bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed,
shits the seed out, plant grows,

1006
01:25:18,191 --> 01:25:22,218
Bird's got a job,
shit's got a job, seed's got a job,

1007
01:25:25,064 --> 01:25:28,192
And you've got a job,

1008
01:25:28,267 --> 01:25:30,599
You done good, goat,

1009
01:25:31,738 --> 01:25:34,070
You were a real beauty,

1010
01:25:41,514 --> 01:25:43,482
(goat bleating)

1011
01:25:46,285 --> 01:25:50,119
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
when I'm just hungry,

1012
01:25:50,189 --> 01:25:54,888
Now drink this,
It eases the pain, and you'll sleep,

1013
01:26:02,034 --> 01:26:06,027
Is she waitin' for ya,
this Ada Monroe?

1014
01:26:06,105 --> 01:26:08,300
She was,

1015
01:26:08,374 --> 01:26:11,172
I don't know,

1016
01:26:11,244 --> 01:26:14,577
Or even if she knows me,

1017
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:17,410
Lie down,

1018
01:26:17,517 --> 01:26:19,576
I'm like the boy
who goes for wood in winter

1019
01:26:19,685 --> 01:26:22,848
and comes back in spring with a whistle,

1020
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:28,424
Like every fool sent off to fight
with a flag and a lie,

1021
01:26:31,264 --> 01:26:35,928
That's the laudanum gettin' to ya,
That's good,

1022
01:26:36,002 --> 01:26:37,993
Say somethin' more,

1023
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:40,061
(cries out)

1024
01:26:42,775 --> 01:26:44,766
She got me a book,

1025
01:26:46,179 --> 01:26:48,170
Ada Monroe,

1026
01:26:50,616 --> 01:26:52,777
A man by the name of Bartram,

1027
01:26:54,887 --> 01:26:57,082
He wrote about his travels,

1028
01:26:58,157 --> 01:27:00,648
Sometimes,,,

1029
01:27:00,726 --> 01:27:03,718
just readin' the name of a place,,,

1030
01:27:04,897 --> 01:27:06,888
near home,,,

1031
01:27:11,137 --> 01:27:13,128
Sorell Cove,

1032
01:27:14,874 --> 01:27:16,865
Bishop's Creek,

1033
01:27:18,444 --> 01:27:21,902
Those places
belonged to people before us,

1034
01:27:23,182 --> 01:27:25,207
To the Cherokee,

1035
01:27:25,318 --> 01:27:29,311
What did he call Cold Mountain?

1036
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:37,423
How could a name,,,
not even a real name,,,

1037
01:27:39,499 --> 01:27:41,831
break your heart?

1038
01:27:45,972 --> 01:27:47,963
It's her,

1039
01:27:50,009 --> 01:27:53,672
She's the place I'm headin',

1040
01:27:55,615 --> 01:27:59,517
And I hardly know her,
I hardly know her!

1041
01:28:03,589 --> 01:28:07,150
And I just can't seem to get back to her,

1042
01:28:11,831 --> 01:28:16,530
(Ada) "To have traveled so far,
from east to west,

1043
01:28:16,602 --> 01:28:18,866
a thousand terrible miles. "

1044
01:28:18,938 --> 01:28:20,929
I have to close my eyes,

1045
01:28:21,007 --> 01:28:23,942
"My feet treadin' all God's surface -

1046
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:28,344
"his ocean, his swamps,
his slopes and ridges -

1047
01:28:28,447 --> 01:28:34,386
"to find myself, at last,
a mark in the aching snow,

1048
01:28:34,487 --> 01:28:37,149
"from whence I beheld
through a blue haze

1049
01:28:37,223 --> 01:28:41,250
a world of mountains
piled upon mountains,"

1050
01:28:42,194 --> 01:28:44,185
(Ruby) Ada!

1051
01:28:45,598 --> 01:28:47,589
Ada!

1052
01:28:52,071 --> 01:28:54,130
- It's a man!
- What is?

1053
01:28:54,206 --> 01:28:58,768
Raidin' our corncrib!
Got him in the trap! That's him yelpin'!

1054
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:03,209
- (man) Help!
- Here,

1055
01:29:03,316 --> 01:29:05,978
Help! Damn,

1056
01:29:06,919 --> 01:29:09,012
Listen up!

1057
01:29:09,121 --> 01:29:10,748
You got,,, Aim!

1058
01:29:10,823 --> 01:29:13,189
You got a barrel trained on your rear end!

1059
01:29:13,259 --> 01:29:16,319
- Get me outta this dang thing!
- You got a weapon?

1060
01:29:16,395 --> 01:29:21,389
No, ma'am, I'm,,,
My fists are about to drop off,

1061
01:29:21,467 --> 01:29:24,231
Unbelievable,

1062
01:29:25,104 --> 01:29:28,073
- Stobrod Thewes!
- Ruby?

1063
01:29:29,275 --> 01:29:31,743
Agh! (sobs)

1064
01:29:33,546 --> 01:29:35,878
That's my daddy,

1065
01:29:37,183 --> 01:29:40,311
Just so's you know,
I can eat while she's doin' this,

1066
01:29:40,419 --> 01:29:43,217
(Ruby) Just so's you know,
you ain't eatin' inside,

1067
01:29:43,289 --> 01:29:48,249
Number one, they hang people round here
for takin' in deserters,

1068
01:29:48,327 --> 01:29:52,388
Number two,
even if they was givin' out prizes,

1069
01:29:52,465 --> 01:29:55,093
you'd still eat outside,

1070
01:29:55,167 --> 01:29:57,465
- You're scarred,
- I'm what?

1071
01:29:57,536 --> 01:30:00,369
Your heart, Scarred,
I did wrong to ya,

1072
01:30:00,439 --> 01:30:04,671
You'd be scarred, You'd be real scarred if
I hadn't wrapped them trap teeth in sackin',

1073
01:30:04,744 --> 01:30:08,373
- Which was my idea,
- Which was her idea,

1074
01:30:09,415 --> 01:30:12,578
- I hurt you,
- Good God,

1075
01:30:12,685 --> 01:30:15,882
I made up 50 tunes with you in mind,

1076
01:30:15,955 --> 01:30:19,152
Ruby this, Ruby that,
Ruby with the eyes that sparkle,

1077
01:30:19,225 --> 01:30:21,989
Hey! Let's agree,

1078
01:30:22,061 --> 01:30:26,259
You beat me,
you abandoned me, you ignored me,

1079
01:30:26,332 --> 01:30:27,993
then you beat me some more,

1080
01:30:28,067 --> 01:30:32,561
And all of that is better'n
"Ruby with the eyes that sparkle,"

1081
01:30:32,638 --> 01:30:35,436
I'm changed, People change,

1082
01:30:35,508 --> 01:30:37,567
War changes people somethin' terrible,

1083
01:30:37,643 --> 01:30:40,441
Ruby's told you, I've no doubt,
I wasn't always the best,

1084
01:30:40,513 --> 01:30:42,640
You were an asshole!

1085
01:30:42,748 --> 01:30:44,807
I can't disagree with that,
I was,

1086
01:30:45,484 --> 01:30:49,284
- Would you get him outta here?
- Music's changed me,

1087
01:30:49,355 --> 01:30:51,346
I'm full of music, Ruby,

1088
01:30:51,457 --> 01:30:53,516
I wish I'd brung my fiddle,

1089
01:30:53,592 --> 01:30:55,890
Hey, Ruby, I got a new fiddle,

1090
01:30:55,961 --> 01:31:01,422
Oh, it's a beautiful fiddle, It's full of tunes,
Ruby, I didn't know I had it in me,

1091
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:04,731
- You're all set,
- l,,,

1092
01:31:12,445 --> 01:31:15,107
Bless you both,

1093
01:31:17,817 --> 01:31:19,785
All right, then,

1094
01:31:25,057 --> 01:31:27,252
Ain't you got a proper coat?

1095
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:32,822
Aw, darlin', I'm fine, you know, And you just
say the word, I won't come back neither,

1096
01:31:32,898 --> 01:31:35,662
Don't wanna put you or your mistress here
in any bother,

1097
01:31:35,735 --> 01:31:38,499
I'm not Ruby's employer,

1098
01:31:38,571 --> 01:31:40,505
Oh, Beg pardon,

1099
01:31:40,573 --> 01:31:42,404
Nobody is,

1100
01:31:42,475 --> 01:31:44,466
Oh,

1101
01:31:52,685 --> 01:31:56,587
You know who really needs a coat, darlin'?
My partner, Fat boy name of Pangle,

1102
01:31:56,655 --> 01:31:59,351
We're hidin' up in a cave
with a singer from Georgia,

1103
01:31:59,425 --> 01:32:04,385
and Pangle, he feels the cold like
a thin man, but there ain't no coat'll fit him,

1104
01:32:08,634 --> 01:32:10,033
I love you, Ruby,

1105
01:32:12,738 --> 01:32:16,299
In case the sky falls on our head,

1106
01:32:16,375 --> 01:32:18,900
You always were a good girl,

1107
01:32:29,188 --> 01:32:34,387
Ooh! He's so full of manure, that man,

1108
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:38,396
We could lay him in the dirt and,,,
grow another one just like him,

1109
01:32:39,431 --> 01:32:42,332
That's medicine, that's goat meat,

1110
01:32:43,636 --> 01:32:45,831
And you're sick of both,

1111
01:32:45,905 --> 01:32:49,341
I have a deal to thank you for,

1112
01:32:49,408 --> 01:32:52,138
That's just for show,

1113
01:33:10,362 --> 01:33:13,058
(country music on fiddle and banjo)

1114
01:33:46,232 --> 01:33:48,860
Ruby with the eyes that sparkle

1115
01:34:02,214 --> 01:34:04,705
- Get on back where you came from!
- (laughing)

1116
01:34:04,817 --> 01:34:07,342
- Thank you for my coat!
- Thanks for the food!

1117
01:34:07,453 --> 01:34:10,513
- Git!
- Ruby with the eyes that sparkle!

1118
01:34:10,623 --> 01:34:14,684
- (Pangle) I love my coat!
- (Stobrod howls)

1119
01:34:26,939 --> 01:34:31,706
(Ada) "My love for Linton
is like the foliage in the woods.

1120
01:34:31,777 --> 01:34:37,215
"Time will change it, I'm well aware,
as winter changes the trees.

1121
01:34:37,283 --> 01:34:42,585
"My love for Heathcliff
resembles the eternal rocks beneath.

1122
01:34:43,455 --> 01:34:46,618
"A source of little visible delight,

1123
01:34:46,692 --> 01:34:48,853
"but necessary,

1124
01:34:50,162 --> 01:34:52,562
"He's always,,,

1125
01:34:53,732 --> 01:34:55,723
always in my mind,"

1126
01:34:55,801 --> 01:34:58,099
She ain't gonna marry Linton, is she?

1127
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:02,300
You can't say that about Heathcliff
and then marry Linton,

1128
01:35:02,374 --> 01:35:03,841
Hmm,

1129
01:35:03,909 --> 01:35:06,844
We'll find out,

1130
01:35:09,415 --> 01:35:11,645
Tomorrow,

1131
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:15,186
I'm not waitin' till tomorrow!

1132
01:35:15,854 --> 01:35:17,685
Ruby,,,

1133
01:35:17,756 --> 01:35:22,284
"A source of,,, little visible delight,

1134
01:35:23,462 --> 01:35:26,226
but,,, necessary."

1135
01:35:29,835 --> 01:35:32,963
I like that,

1136
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:37,309
(Ruby continues reading haltingly)

1137
01:35:42,581 --> 01:35:45,049
(rumble of thunder)

1138
01:35:47,619 --> 01:35:50,087
(baby crying)

1139
01:35:58,731 --> 01:35:59,663
(knocks)

1140
01:35:59,732 --> 01:36:03,725
I'm a Confederate soldier,,,
on furlough,

1141
01:36:03,802 --> 01:36:06,896
I need shelter,,, and food,

1142
01:36:17,683 --> 01:36:20,015
(woman) I've got a rifle!

1143
01:36:20,919 --> 01:36:22,887
Fair enough,

1144
01:36:24,156 --> 01:36:26,556
I have some beans and corn pone,

1145
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:28,786
All I got,

1146
01:36:35,901 --> 01:36:38,199
- Thank you,
- I'm alone here,

1147
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:40,932
as you can see, with my baby,

1148
01:36:41,006 --> 01:36:43,702
I need to believe you mean no harm,

1149
01:36:47,379 --> 01:36:48,869
No,

1150
01:36:49,381 --> 01:36:51,576
I don't want it,

1151
01:36:51,683 --> 01:36:55,483
If I had my way, they'd take metal
altogether out of this world,

1152
01:36:55,554 --> 01:36:58,045
Every blade, every gun,

1153
01:36:58,157 --> 01:37:00,625
(baby grizzling)

1154
01:37:04,029 --> 01:37:06,020
(closes door)

1155
01:37:12,738 --> 01:37:14,797
It's all right,

1156
01:37:14,873 --> 01:37:17,774
You're burnin' up, little man,

1157
01:37:20,946 --> 01:37:23,972
(baby coughs)

1158
01:37:28,587 --> 01:37:30,612
(baby cries)

1159
01:37:34,126 --> 01:37:36,117
Is your baby sick?

1160
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:44,568
My man's dead, Took his wound
at Gettysburg and never saw his boy,

1161
01:37:44,636 --> 01:37:45,796
I'm sorry,

1162
01:37:45,871 --> 01:37:49,830
It's pretty much what you'll get
if you knock on any door of this war,

1163
01:37:49,908 --> 01:37:52,706
Man dead, woman left,

1164
01:37:54,813 --> 01:37:57,077
(baby cries)

1165
01:37:57,182 --> 01:37:58,911
It's mean food, but it's hot,

1166
01:37:59,017 --> 01:38:02,783
There's been no huntin' on the road,
just cress and roots,

1167
01:38:02,855 --> 01:38:05,915
I need to try and feed this man,

1168
01:38:05,991 --> 01:38:09,757
- (crying)
- Shh, You gotta eat somethin', baby,

1169
01:38:11,096 --> 01:38:13,087
(thunder)

1170
01:38:23,275 --> 01:38:25,903
He won't feed,

1171
01:38:25,978 --> 01:38:29,379
I'm lnman, by the way,
That's my name,

1172
01:38:30,949 --> 01:38:33,042
I'm Sara,

1173
01:38:35,854 --> 01:38:37,378
My baby's Ethan,

1174
01:38:38,957 --> 01:38:40,549
Glad to know you both,

1175
01:38:50,269 --> 01:38:52,260
(thunder)

1176
01:38:53,438 --> 01:38:56,635
You look about his size,

1177
01:38:56,708 --> 01:38:59,871
He was another man straight up and down,

1178
01:38:59,945 --> 01:39:02,004
Thank you,

1179
01:39:28,840 --> 01:39:30,637
Everything fit?

1180
01:39:32,244 --> 01:39:34,474
These boots are good boots,

1181
01:39:41,553 --> 01:39:44,215
Well, I'll say good night, then,

1182
01:39:45,891 --> 01:39:47,882
Good night,

1183
01:39:58,904 --> 01:40:00,895
(country fiddle music)

1184
01:40:02,441 --> 01:40:04,602
Wake up, gals, let's go to the river

1185
01:40:04,676 --> 01:40:06,871
Wake up, gals, let's go to the river

1186
01:40:06,945 --> 01:40:09,277
Wake up, gals, let's go to the river

1187
01:40:09,381 --> 01:40:11,611
Then we'll join the band

1188
01:40:11,717 --> 01:40:16,245
Christmastime will soon be over,
Christmastime will soon be over

1189
01:40:16,355 --> 01:40:21,019
Christmastime will soon be over,
then we'll join the band

1190
01:40:21,093 --> 01:40:23,960
- She don't speak?
- Can't speak! I told you,

1191
01:40:24,029 --> 01:40:26,259
Well, is she feeble, then?

1192
01:40:26,331 --> 01:40:28,663
(Ada and Ruby) No!

1193
01:40:28,734 --> 01:40:30,065
Never mind him,

1194
01:40:30,135 --> 01:40:32,399
Get up, gals, don't be bitter

1195
01:40:32,471 --> 01:40:34,701
Get up, gals, don't be bitter

1196
01:40:34,773 --> 01:40:36,900
(Ada) Get up, girls, don't be bitter

1197
01:40:36,975 --> 01:40:39,205
Then we'll join the band

1198
01:40:52,958 --> 01:40:54,949
Will you come inside?

1199
01:41:04,603 --> 01:41:06,764
(door creaks open)

1200
01:41:18,016 --> 01:41:24,387
Would you do somethin' for me?
Do you,,, think you could,,,

1201
01:41:24,456 --> 01:41:29,257
Iie here next to me and not,,,

1202
01:42:33,161 --> 01:42:35,152
(sobs)

1203
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:43,336
- I'll go, I'll go, shall l?
- No,

1204
01:42:43,404 --> 01:42:45,736
I don't want you to,

1205
01:42:51,579 --> 01:42:53,570
Thing is,,,

1206
01:42:56,517 --> 01:42:58,781
I love someone,

1207
01:42:58,853 --> 01:43:00,821
(Sara sobs)

1208
01:43:04,258 --> 01:43:06,886
I love someone very much,

1209
01:43:06,961 --> 01:43:08,952
(Sara sobs)

1210
01:43:25,179 --> 01:43:27,170
Try and sleep,

1211
01:43:40,027 --> 01:43:42,825
(mournful fiddle and banjo music)

1212
01:43:45,967 --> 01:43:53,396
I know dark clouds will hover o'er me

1213
01:43:53,474 --> 01:44:01,279
I know my pathway is rough and steep

1214
01:44:01,382 --> 01:44:08,254
But golden fields lie out before me

1215
01:44:08,656 --> 01:44:16,153
Where weary eyes no more will weep

1216
01:44:16,230 --> 01:44:23,363
I'm goin ' home to see my father

1217
01:44:23,938 --> 01:44:31,344
I'm goin ' home no more to roam

1218
01:44:31,412 --> 01:44:39,285
I am just goin ' over Jordan

1219
01:44:39,353 --> 01:44:49,194
I am just goin '...

1220
01:44:51,766 --> 01:44:55,202
- Merry Christmas, Pangle,
- Night, ma'am,

1221
01:44:55,269 --> 01:44:57,703
Merry Christmas, Georgia,

1222
01:44:57,772 --> 01:45:01,071
- Merry Christmas, Miss Ada,

1223
01:45:01,709 --> 01:45:03,939
- Merry Christmas, darlin',

1224
01:45:04,011 --> 01:45:07,139
- We won't,
- It's dangerous, Don't sleep here,

1225
01:45:07,214 --> 01:45:11,207
Oh, it's bitter,
They could stop one night,

1226
01:45:11,319 --> 01:45:14,083
They stop one night,
they're gonna wanna stop two,

1227
01:45:14,155 --> 01:45:16,453
I'll be all right,
This coat's warm,

1228
01:45:16,524 --> 01:45:18,890
What about next Sunday?
It'll be New Year,

1229
01:45:18,959 --> 01:45:22,656
- Maybe,
- Gonna be a better one than 1 884,

1230
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:26,723
- This war's over in a month,
- That's what he said a month ago,

1231
01:45:26,801 --> 01:45:29,269
It started off bein' over in a month,

1232
01:45:29,337 --> 01:45:32,067
Night, Miss Sally,
Merry Christmas,

1233
01:45:32,139 --> 01:45:35,199
- (Georgia) Night, Miss Ruby,
- Night,

1234
01:45:36,143 --> 01:45:37,405
- Night, ma'am,
- Night,

1235
01:45:37,478 --> 01:45:39,969
You're stayin' with us tonight, Sally,

1236
01:45:40,047 --> 01:45:43,039
- That's my Ruby,
- She's an original,

1237
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:51,249
- (Ruby) What kind of name's Georgia?
- It's where he's from, It's not his name,

1238
01:45:51,325 --> 01:45:56,627
Well, I know it's meant to be
the ugliest state under the heavens,

1239
01:45:56,697 --> 01:45:59,427
Why do you care what his name is?

1240
01:46:00,334 --> 01:46:03,599
Hey, what do you call
that cluster of stars right there?

1241
01:46:03,671 --> 01:46:05,798
Right there,

1242
01:46:05,873 --> 01:46:08,569
Uh,,, There? That's Orion,

1243
01:46:08,642 --> 01:46:13,875
And that's Gemini,
and that is Orion's big dog,

1244
01:46:13,948 --> 01:46:15,939
Canis Major,

1245
01:46:16,050 --> 01:46:18,177
Listen to her, Sal,

1246
01:46:18,285 --> 01:46:21,618
She's turned into a regular highland girl,

1247
01:46:21,689 --> 01:46:27,286
Nah, I could always name the stars, Ruby,
That was never my problem,

1248
01:46:30,698 --> 01:46:33,531
I love you, darlin',

1249
01:46:33,601 --> 01:46:36,866
in case that big old sky falls on our heads,

1250
01:46:36,937 --> 01:46:38,199
Aw,,,

1251
01:46:41,475 --> 01:46:45,104
And I love you too, Sally,
I do,

1252
01:46:48,048 --> 01:46:50,516
- Get up!
- (baby cries)

1253
01:46:50,584 --> 01:46:54,076
Get up! Get out of here, quick!
The Yankees are coming!

1254
01:46:54,188 --> 01:46:56,019
The Yankees, they're here,

1255
01:46:56,090 --> 01:47:00,026
If they find you here,
things'll go bad on all of us,

1256
01:47:00,094 --> 01:47:03,723
- I can try and fight 'em,

1259
01:47:21,649 --> 01:47:24,209

That's right, Take the chickens,
Take the chickens, They're all I got,

1266
01:47:45,573 --> 01:47:47,666

1267
01:47:47,741 --> 01:47:51,302
- You lyin' Southern trash,
- (Sara sobbing)

1268
01:47:51,979 --> 01:47:53,970
We're hungry,

01:47:54,048 --> 01:47:55,538
We got all day,

1270

See, those birds

1271
01:47:59,453 --> 01:48:01,216
Please cover up my boy,

1272
01:48:01,288 --> 01:48:04,018
Just tell us where the food is,

- I got a hog!

1278
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:21,539
I got a hog!

1279
01:48:21,609 --> 01:48:25,170
- He's hid out behind the house!
- Take a look,

1280
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:29,213
Please! (sobs)

1281
01:48:30,784 --> 01:48:33,446
Please, sir, Please,

1282
01:48:33,554 --> 01:48:35,545
He's just a baby!

1283
01:48:37,291 --> 01:48:39,759
- He's shaking!
- (Ethan cries)

1284
01:48:39,827 --> 01:48:42,557
Please, just cover him up,

1285
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:47,067
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?

1286
01:48:47,134 --> 01:48:48,601
(hog squeals)

1287
01:48:48,669 --> 01:48:51,661
I ain't got nothin' else, I swear,

1288
01:48:51,739 --> 01:48:54,674
- That ain't necessarily so,

1289
01:48:54,742 --> 01:48:57,506
Take me inside,

1290
01:48:57,578 --> 01:49:02,242

You take that hog!

1295
01:49:19,099 --> 01:49:21,465
No! Agh!

(Sara groaning)

1297
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:27,771
(Ethan crying)

1298
01:49:27,841 --> 01:49:31,242
- You know, he's gettin' ready to take a fit,
- What do you care?

1299
01:49:31,312 --> 01:49:33,803
(Ethan crying)

1300
01:49:33,881 --> 01:49:35,872
(hog squealing)

1301
01:49:45,759 --> 01:49:48,319
- Shh,,, Shh,,,
- (crying stops)

1302
01:49:48,395 --> 01:49:50,863
That's better, Shh, That's better,

1303
01:49:54,535 --> 01:49:57,368
Hey, come on,
Leave some for the rest of us,

1304
01:49:57,438 --> 01:49:58,928
(Sara sobbing)

1305
01:50:08,148 --> 01:50:10,616
Move away from the baby!

1306
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:14,446
Towards me!

1307
01:50:14,555 --> 01:50:18,013
Don't shoot,
We just wanted food,

1308
01:50:18,125 --> 01:50:20,457
Take off your boots,

1309
01:50:22,096 --> 01:50:25,463
Take off your pants,
Take off your shirt,

1310
01:50:26,433 --> 01:50:28,424
(sobbing)

1311
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,831
Don't shoot me, please,

1312
01:50:36,377 --> 01:50:39,710
We're starvin',
We haven't eaten in days,

1313
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:44,479
- Come on,
- We're starving, We haven't eaten in days,

1314
01:50:44,585 --> 01:50:46,610
Come on!

1315
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:51,984
Thanks, Thank you,

1316
01:50:52,059 --> 01:50:54,323

1318
01:50:56,764 --> 01:50:58,698
(hog squeals)

1319
01:51:00,401 --> 01:51:01,800
(horses whinny)

1320
01:51:57,124 --> 01:52:01,720
- (Pangle) I love the snow,
- I hate the snow, I hate the cold,

1321
01:52:03,664 --> 01:52:06,656
- Come on!
- (Georgia) Fellas, what's the rush?

1322
01:52:06,734 --> 01:52:11,296
If Ruby finds out we've spent the night,
there'll be hell to pay,

1323
01:52:47,941 --> 01:52:51,104
(Ada) "My love, where are you?

1324
01:52:52,012 --> 01:52:55,607
"With no hope of reaching you,
I write to you,

1325
01:52:55,716 --> 01:52:57,684
"as I always do,

1326
01:52:59,653 --> 01:53:01,985
as I have always done. "

1327
01:53:09,296 --> 01:53:13,756
I'm alone, but I don't worry

1328
01:53:13,834 --> 01:53:18,134
'Cause I'm sittin' on top of the world

1329
01:53:19,072 --> 01:53:21,165
(hums)

1330
01:53:22,442 --> 01:53:25,570
You reckon we could eat this?

1331
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:27,907
Hey,

1332
01:53:27,981 --> 01:53:31,644
Well, you know, you cook somethin'
long enough, you can eat anything,

1333
01:53:31,752 --> 01:53:34,983
It's froze,
How long it been there for?

1334
01:53:35,055 --> 01:53:37,956
- You hungry?
- Yeah,

1335
01:53:38,025 --> 01:53:40,118
Not very long,

1336
01:53:41,995 --> 01:53:43,986
(groaning)

1337
01:53:50,404 --> 01:53:52,895
(groaning)

1338
01:54:11,425 --> 01:54:13,416
(vomits)

1339
01:54:15,095 --> 01:54:16,756
(horse whinnies)

1340
01:54:16,830 --> 01:54:18,730
Good evenin',

1341
01:54:18,799 --> 01:54:21,495
Hope we didn't disturb you,

1342
01:54:21,568 --> 01:54:25,800
D'you mind if I warm myself by your fire?

1343
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:28,269
Name's Teague,

1344
01:54:28,342 --> 01:54:30,936
- Do I know you?
- Stobrod Thewes,

1345
01:54:31,011 --> 01:54:32,000
(coughs)

1346
01:54:32,145 --> 01:54:34,375
- That your wife?
- That's a "he."

1347
01:54:34,448 --> 01:54:36,211
Is "he" your wife?

1348
01:54:36,316 --> 01:54:40,878
We're musicians,
He picks a banjo, I got a fiddle,

1349
01:54:40,988 --> 01:54:44,321
Your sweetheart's got
a nice piece of flesh on him,

1350
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:47,849
- He looks pretty romantic by the fire,
- It's a picture of love,

1351
01:54:47,928 --> 01:54:49,919
(sniggering)

1352
01:54:54,501 --> 01:54:56,833
You gonna play that fiddle?

1353
01:54:56,904 --> 01:54:58,337
Sure,

1354
01:54:58,605 --> 01:55:00,470
Sure,

1355
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:02,531
Hey, wake up,

1356
01:55:04,211 --> 01:55:06,202
Evenin', missis,

1357
01:55:06,947 --> 01:55:09,677
- Where's Georgia?
- "Where's Georgia"?

1358
01:55:09,783 --> 01:55:12,377
(laughter)

1359
01:55:13,987 --> 01:55:17,479
- Captain Teague wants us to play now,
- Love to,

1360
01:55:17,591 --> 01:55:21,357
We heard there were some deserters
up in these parts hidden out in a big cave,

1361
01:55:21,428 --> 01:55:24,363
- Not come to my ears,
- So you don't know where this big cave is?

1362
01:55:24,431 --> 01:55:26,365
- No, sir,
- You do, Stobs, He means,,,

1363
01:55:26,433 --> 01:55:27,957
No, right, No, no,

1364
01:55:28,035 --> 01:55:31,801
There is a cave right up near Bearpen
Branch, We played some music up there,

1365
01:55:31,872 --> 01:55:36,400
- Never occurred to me they were outliers,
- It ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch,

1366
01:55:36,476 --> 01:55:38,307
He's always gettin' lost,

1367
01:55:38,378 --> 01:55:41,279
That cave - we live there,

1368
01:55:41,381 --> 01:55:45,784
I used to freeze up in that cave
till I got gived this new coat,

1369
01:55:45,852 --> 01:55:49,879
Ruby made me this coat,
I like my coat,

1370
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:53,357
This part belonged to a reverend
and this part belonged to a horse,

1371
01:55:53,427 --> 01:55:58,091
Ruby said - what is it? -
I should pray or neigh, dependin',

1372
01:55:58,165 --> 01:56:00,429
He don't,,,
he don't know what he's sayin',

1373
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:04,334
He got a mind
no bigger than a pickled walnut,

1374
01:56:04,404 --> 01:56:07,373
- It's a good coat,
- (Pangle giggles)

1375
01:56:09,743 --> 01:56:17,081
I wish, I wish my baby was born

1376
01:56:18,418 --> 01:56:25,722
And sittin' on its papa's knee

1377
01:56:25,792 --> 01:56:27,885
And me, poor girl

1378
01:56:27,961 --> 01:56:33,160
And me, poor girl, were dead and gone

1379
01:56:34,601 --> 01:56:42,736
And the green grass growin' o'er my feet

1380
01:56:43,377 --> 01:56:50,613
I ain't ahead, nor never will be

1381
01:56:52,285 --> 01:56:59,817
Till the sweet apple grows
on a sour apple tree

1382
01:57:01,261 --> 01:57:05,664
The owl, the owl

1383
01:57:05,732 --> 01:57:08,394
Is a lonely bird

1384
01:57:10,003 --> 01:57:13,564
It chills my heart.

1385
01:57:14,341 --> 01:57:17,640
With dread and terror

1386
01:57:18,845 --> 01:57:21,473
That someone's blood

1387
01:57:21,548 --> 01:57:23,311
Someone's blood

1388
01:57:23,417 --> 01:57:26,477
There on his wing

1389
01:57:27,721 --> 01:57:31,316
That someone's blood

1390
01:57:32,125 --> 01:57:35,891
There on his... feather

1391
01:57:43,937 --> 01:57:45,802
Broke my young heart,

1392
01:57:47,374 --> 01:57:50,275
(hoots like an owl)

1393
01:57:50,343 --> 01:57:52,334
We gonna be here all night?

1394
01:57:54,881 --> 01:57:56,872
Stand over there,

1395
01:58:08,028 --> 01:58:11,657
Ruby, she don't know
one end of the war from the other,

1396
01:58:11,731 --> 01:58:14,825
You don't have to worry yourself about her,
is what I'm sayin',

1397
01:58:14,901 --> 01:58:18,769
Or Ada, neither,
You know what I'm sayin'?

1398
01:58:18,839 --> 01:58:21,569
You too,
You stand over there,

1399
01:58:24,578 --> 01:58:26,978
We gonna get our tintype made?

1400
01:58:33,620 --> 01:58:35,451
Don't smile,

1401
01:58:35,522 --> 01:58:37,251
- What?
- Quit smilin',

1402
01:58:37,324 --> 01:58:39,622
He always smiles,
He don't mean nothin' by it,

1403
01:58:39,693 --> 01:58:42,355
I told him, there ain't nothin' in this world
worth a smile!

1404
01:58:42,429 --> 01:58:44,954
Put your hat over your face,

1405
01:58:51,738 --> 01:58:53,763
Cover your face with your hat,

1406
01:59:02,482 --> 01:59:04,416
- (Georgia) Ruby!
- What?

1407
01:59:05,051 --> 01:59:06,678
- Ruby!
- What's wrong?

1408
01:59:06,786 --> 01:59:10,222
- Teague,,, The Home Guard,,,
- What?

1409
01:59:11,291 --> 01:59:13,384
They shot your daddy!

1410
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:15,553
They shot your daddy, and Pangle too!

1411
01:59:21,601 --> 01:59:25,833
I told Georgia he can stop here,
I told him he can sleep in the barn,

1412
01:59:25,906 --> 01:59:29,774
He's got nothin' inside him,
He'll walk out of here and die in the snow,

1413
01:59:29,843 --> 01:59:33,074
He can milk the cows,
I was worried about that,

1414
01:59:35,415 --> 01:59:39,351
It's five hours' climb from here,
He drew a map,

1415
01:59:39,452 --> 01:59:41,420
I'm ready,

1416
01:59:42,322 --> 01:59:45,155
You know them fools
stayed the night in the mill?

1417
01:59:46,426 --> 01:59:50,522
That's Stobrod Thewes, Can't do
one good thing without addin' the bad,

1418
01:59:50,597 --> 01:59:55,091
Left tracks in the snow all the way up
for the Home Guard to follow,

1419
01:59:55,168 --> 01:59:57,466
- Sign that says "Shoot me."
- Ruby,,,

1420
02:00:00,807 --> 02:00:02,297
Ruby,

1421
02:00:04,511 --> 02:00:06,672
I'm sorry,

1422
02:00:08,682 --> 02:00:11,583
Every piece of this is man's bullshit,

1423
02:00:11,651 --> 02:00:14,279
They call this war a cloud over the land,

1424
02:00:14,387 --> 02:00:19,154
but they made the weather, and then they
stand in the rain and say "Shit, it's rainin'!"

1425
02:00:24,831 --> 02:00:30,064
If I cry one tear for my daddy,
I stole it off a crocodile,

1426
02:00:33,873 --> 02:00:34,931
All right, then,

1427
02:01:24,391 --> 02:01:26,382
All right, then,

1428
02:01:27,427 --> 02:01:30,419
Dear God, (gasps)

1429
02:01:34,734 --> 02:01:36,725
Oh, dear God,

1430
02:01:43,176 --> 02:01:45,644
He ain't here,

1431
02:01:45,712 --> 02:01:49,705
Agh! Teague's probably took him,

1432
02:01:49,816 --> 02:01:53,650
They did that with the Swanger boys,
didn't they?

1433
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,689
Strung 'em up, as a warnin',

1434
02:02:01,928 --> 02:02:04,192
They took his coat,

1435
02:02:04,264 --> 02:02:06,129
Why would they take his coat?

1436
02:02:06,199 --> 02:02:08,190
(plucks strings)

1437
02:02:12,005 --> 02:02:14,473
Daddy? Daddy!

1438
02:02:14,908 --> 02:02:16,899
Daddy!

1439
02:02:22,882 --> 02:02:24,577
- Daddy?
- (soft groan)

1440
02:02:24,684 --> 02:02:27,084
He's still breathin'!

1441
02:02:27,153 --> 02:02:29,553
It's Ruby!

1442
02:02:29,622 --> 02:02:31,351
Don't you die on me again!

1443
02:02:37,897 --> 02:02:41,697
- We gotta get him home,
- He won't make it, He'll die first,

1444
02:02:41,768 --> 02:02:45,169
He's got hardly no blood left in him,

1445
02:02:47,941 --> 02:02:49,932
(Ada) There it is, I feel it,

1446
02:02:50,009 --> 02:02:51,033
- You got it?
- Yep,

1447
02:02:52,011 --> 02:02:56,539
(Ruby) There's a place close.
Old Cherokee, it used to be.

1448
02:02:56,649 --> 02:02:58,879
It's got shelter, water.

1449
02:02:58,985 --> 02:03:01,647
I used to hide up there
when he'd get a temper goin'.

1450
02:03:01,755 --> 02:03:03,723
God!

1451
02:03:11,131 --> 02:03:15,124
- I'll go look for some food,
- T ake the shotgun,

1452
02:03:41,094 --> 02:03:42,789
Goddamn,

1453
02:03:51,337 --> 02:03:53,532
(footfall)

1454
02:03:53,606 --> 02:03:55,597
Turn around!

1455
02:03:57,177 --> 02:03:59,737
Go back where you came from!

1456
02:04:01,347 --> 02:04:02,837
Go back!

1457
02:04:07,153 --> 02:04:09,212
Ada?

1458
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:11,016
Ada Monroe?

1459
02:04:13,126 --> 02:04:15,924
Turn around or I'll shoot!

1460
02:04:44,491 --> 02:04:45,822
Inman?

1461
02:04:46,159 --> 02:04:48,150
Inman?

1462
02:05:01,207 --> 02:05:03,368
(whispers) lnman,

1463
02:05:35,608 --> 02:05:37,701
You better come with me,

1464
02:05:50,356 --> 02:05:52,324
Ruby,

1465
02:05:53,226 --> 02:05:54,853
This is lnman,

1466
02:05:59,933 --> 02:06:02,367
Oh! Congratulations!

1467
02:06:02,435 --> 02:06:05,962
Oughta send you out with a shotgun
a lot more!

1468
02:06:07,707 --> 02:06:09,766
Looks if he's about to topple over,

1469
02:06:11,010 --> 02:06:13,604
- I may need to,
- You shot or somethin'?

1470
02:06:15,615 --> 02:06:17,173
Not lately,

1471
02:06:28,561 --> 02:06:31,655
- He's asleep,
- I ain't surprised,

1472
02:06:31,731 --> 02:06:36,168
- Your man looked tuckered out,
- I saw him,

1473
02:06:36,235 --> 02:06:40,501
In Sally Swanger's well,
A man like a black smudge in the snow,

1474
02:06:40,573 --> 02:06:44,009
- Well, there you go,
- It wasn't the same, what I saw,

1475
02:06:44,077 --> 02:06:46,238
In the well it was as if he were falling,

1476
02:06:46,312 --> 02:06:49,839
- You probably just don't remember it right,
- I remember it exactly,

1477
02:06:49,949 --> 02:06:52,008
There were crows - black crows,

1478
02:06:52,118 --> 02:06:54,245
They were flyin' towards me,

1479
02:06:54,354 --> 02:06:57,653
Ruby, I thought I was seein' him fall,

1480
02:06:59,993 --> 02:07:03,053
Instead, I was seein' him come back to me,

1481
02:07:05,431 --> 02:07:08,889
I got big plans for that farm,

1482
02:07:12,905 --> 02:07:14,736
I know,

1483
02:07:15,708 --> 02:07:17,505
I know you have,

1484
02:07:17,577 --> 02:07:21,513
I got a vision in my mind
of how Black Cove oughta be,

1485
02:07:25,585 --> 02:07:27,985
I don't know, Ruby,

1486
02:07:28,054 --> 02:07:32,286
All this while
I've been packin' ice around my heart,

1487
02:07:34,927 --> 02:07:37,725
How do I make it melt?

1488
02:07:40,667 --> 02:07:42,134
(Ruby) Hey!

1489
02:07:43,069 --> 02:07:45,503
You about done with my knife?

1490
02:07:46,172 --> 02:07:48,402
We got a bird to cook,

1491
02:07:48,908 --> 02:07:50,739
(lnman) Just about,

1492
02:07:53,546 --> 02:07:57,380
You're makin' a pig's ear of that job,

1493
02:07:58,851 --> 02:08:00,819
Give it to me,

1494
02:08:06,793 --> 02:08:09,421
Oh, I ain't gonna cut you,

1495
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:15,462
Can't see that it'd make
a bit of difference if I did,

1496
02:08:26,212 --> 02:08:28,510
You got the right feelings for her?

1497
02:08:28,948 --> 02:08:31,849
Don't turn your head! Tsk,

1498
02:08:35,555 --> 02:08:36,954
I do,

1499
02:08:44,997 --> 02:08:47,329
(rustling)

1500
02:09:02,582 --> 02:09:05,676
I'm sorry,
I was tryin' to be quiet,

1501
02:09:11,691 --> 02:09:14,023
Did you get my letters?

1502
02:09:15,762 --> 02:09:17,753
I got three letters,

1503
02:09:18,765 --> 02:09:23,293
I carried them,
I carried them in the book you gave me,

1504
02:09:23,369 --> 02:09:25,030
The Bartram,

1505
02:09:26,139 --> 02:09:29,575
I probably sent 1 03,

1506
02:09:34,313 --> 02:09:36,975
Did you write to me?

1507
02:09:37,083 --> 02:09:38,880
Whenever I could,

1508
02:09:38,985 --> 02:09:41,249
If you never got them, I can summarize,

1509
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:44,153
- No, No, no,
- "l pray you are well,

1510
02:09:44,223 --> 02:09:46,555
"l pray I am in your thoughts,

1511
02:09:46,626 --> 02:09:51,893
You are all that keeps me
from slidin' into some dark place."

1512
02:09:51,964 --> 02:09:55,092
How did I keep you?

1513
02:09:55,168 --> 02:09:58,035
We barely knew each other,
It was a few moments,

1514
02:09:58,104 --> 02:09:59,969
A thousand moments,

1515
02:10:02,875 --> 02:10:06,504
They're like a bag,,,
of tiny diamonds,

1516
02:10:08,014 --> 02:10:11,882
Don't matter if they're real
or things I made up,

1517
02:10:13,820 --> 02:10:15,879
The shape of your neck,

1518
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:19,881
That's real,

1519
02:10:20,493 --> 02:10:24,452
The way you felt under my hands
when I pulled you to me,

1520
02:10:35,775 --> 02:10:38,403
You were plowing a field,

1521
02:10:39,412 --> 02:10:42,040
You were carrying a tray,

1522
02:10:42,114 --> 02:10:44,844
- You wouldn't come in,
- No, I wouldn't go in,

1523
02:10:44,951 --> 02:10:49,854
So that's why I had to carry a tray,
So I could come out to see you,

1524
02:10:51,924 --> 02:10:55,018
That kiss,

1525
02:10:55,094 --> 02:10:58,655
Which I kissed every day of my walking,

1526
02:11:00,399 --> 02:11:02,492
Every day I was waiting,

1527
02:11:03,302 --> 02:11:04,826
Longing,

1528
02:11:04,904 --> 02:11:07,964
Longing to see your face,

1529
02:11:14,146 --> 02:11:17,479
If you could see my inside,,,

1530
02:11:17,583 --> 02:11:22,520
Now, whatever you wanna name it -
my spirit? That's what I fear,

1531
02:11:23,623 --> 02:11:25,591
I think I'm ruined,

1532
02:11:25,658 --> 02:11:29,424
They kept tryin' to put me in the ground,

1533
02:11:30,429 --> 02:11:33,091
- But I wasn't ready,
- lnman,,,

1534
02:11:33,165 --> 02:11:36,566
But if I had,,, if I had goodness,
I lost it,

1535
02:11:38,838 --> 02:11:42,035
If I had anything tender in me,
I shot it dead,

1536
02:11:43,776 --> 02:11:47,576
How could I write to you after what I done,

1537
02:11:48,481 --> 02:11:49,641
what I seen?

1538
02:11:49,749 --> 02:11:51,216
(Ruby) Number one,

1539
02:11:51,317 --> 02:11:53,649
shut this door,
It's freezin',

1540
02:11:53,719 --> 02:11:56,711
Number two, shut that door,
It's freezin',

1541
02:11:56,822 --> 02:11:59,222
Layin' on my back,
my fingers poked in my ears,

1542
02:11:59,325 --> 02:12:02,158
tryin' to shut out
who's got a bag of diamonds,

1543
02:12:02,228 --> 02:12:04,423
who's carrying a tray,,,

1544
02:12:04,497 --> 02:12:06,795
If you wanna get three feet up a bull's ass,

1545
02:12:06,866 --> 02:12:10,461
just listen to what sweethearts
whisper to one another,

1546
02:12:10,536 --> 02:12:16,236
In fact, if y'all gonna wimble-wimble
all night, I'm gonna sleep in with him,

1547
02:12:30,957 --> 02:12:34,222
- I'll say good night,
- No,

1548
02:12:37,296 --> 02:12:39,287
Please,,,

1549
02:12:40,299 --> 02:12:42,062
don't say good night,

1550
02:13:06,692 --> 02:13:10,389
Wars make some things pointless,

1551
02:13:13,599 --> 02:13:16,932
It's hard to imagine a wedding,

1552
02:13:18,471 --> 02:13:21,770
I think even my father
would recognize that,

1553
02:13:22,341 --> 02:13:24,775
Ada, I wanna marry you,

1554
02:13:26,078 --> 02:13:27,602
If you'll have me,

1555
02:13:29,215 --> 02:13:34,152
Isn't there some religion where you just
have to say "l marry you" three times,

1556
02:13:34,220 --> 02:13:36,188
and you're man and wife?

1557
02:13:37,123 --> 02:13:39,091
I marry you,

1558
02:13:40,393 --> 02:13:42,520
I marry you, I marry you,

1559
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:49,625
Why is that funny?

1560
02:13:49,702 --> 02:13:55,504
I think it's "l divorce you" three times
and you're not married anymore,

1561
02:13:56,342 --> 02:13:58,276
I can wait for you,

1562
02:13:58,344 --> 02:14:03,805
Oh, lnman,
I marry you, I marry you, I marry you,

1563
02:14:03,916 --> 02:14:05,884
I marry you, I marry you,

1564
02:14:13,859 --> 02:14:17,556
I have so,,,
I have so many buttons, Sorry,

1565
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:23,998
Will you turn your back?

1566
02:14:35,214 --> 02:14:36,579
No,

1567
02:14:38,884 --> 02:14:40,351
No, I will not,

1568
02:15:47,052 --> 02:15:49,282
(Ada gasps)

1569
02:15:56,562 --> 02:15:58,462
(lnman moans)

1570
02:16:26,325 --> 02:16:29,260
I'll lead the horse
at a pace your daddy can tolerate,

1571
02:16:29,328 --> 02:16:33,059
- You two go ahead now,
- No, I don't wanna do that,

1572
02:16:33,132 --> 02:16:35,828
- No, We can all go together,
- It's safer this way,

1573
02:16:35,901 --> 02:16:38,392
We're deserters,
No one has a quarrel with you,

1574
02:16:38,470 --> 02:16:40,461
He's right,

1575
02:16:40,539 --> 02:16:44,737
I gather l,,,
I need permission from you, Ruby,

1576
02:16:44,810 --> 02:16:47,938
if I reckon on livin' at Black Cove,

1577
02:16:57,323 --> 02:16:58,722
All right, then,

1578
02:16:58,824 --> 02:17:00,815
(horse nickers)

1579
02:17:02,661 --> 02:17:04,856
You stay on that horse,

1580
02:17:04,930 --> 02:17:07,865
And don't lose it,
Or sell it,

1581
02:17:08,734 --> 02:17:11,635
Gonna need it back on the farm,

1582
02:17:12,871 --> 02:17:14,429
(mumbles)

1583
02:17:14,506 --> 02:17:16,497
All right, Daddy,

1584
02:17:20,679 --> 02:17:22,442
I don't wanna let you go,

1585
02:17:26,218 --> 02:17:29,415
I'll be with you by nightfall,

1586
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:35,727
Ugh,

1587
02:17:37,529 --> 02:17:39,895
All right, then,

1588
02:18:10,529 --> 02:18:14,363
Hope that Georgia boy's
been tendin' to the animals,

1589
02:18:14,433 --> 02:18:17,368
- I knew you were thinkin' on him,
- I was not!

1590
02:18:17,436 --> 02:18:19,768
- I was thinkin' on swollen udders,
- Oh,,,!

1591
02:18:19,838 --> 02:18:24,070
- And before you say "same difference",,,
- I'm sayin' nothin'!

1592
02:18:24,143 --> 02:18:28,637
Miss Lovey-Dovey!
Miss Lovey-Dovey!

1593
02:18:28,714 --> 02:18:30,739
Hey!

1594
02:18:30,849 --> 02:18:35,013
- That was a long funeral for your daddy,
- That was a wake,

1595
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:36,678
That was lrish,

1596
02:18:38,657 --> 02:18:40,648
Now, your friend Georgia here,,,

1597
02:18:40,726 --> 02:18:44,423
We went down to visit you when
we heard you were harborin' deserters,

1598
02:18:44,496 --> 02:18:48,626
and he told us - after some persuasion -
you were up here,

1599
02:18:48,701 --> 02:18:51,568
(Bosie) We were up and down
this mountain,

1600
02:18:51,637 --> 02:18:52,968
Up and down,

1601
02:18:53,572 --> 02:18:55,403
There will be a reckoning,

1602
02:18:55,474 --> 02:18:58,409
When this war is over,
there will be a reckoning,

1603
02:19:00,079 --> 02:19:02,274
Did you make this coat?

1604
02:19:02,348 --> 02:19:04,339
Helpin' a deserter - that's treason,

1605
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:08,944
Now, I know
it's half horse and half reverend,

1606
02:19:10,589 --> 02:19:12,557
A reckonin'?

1607
02:19:14,193 --> 02:19:17,321
The reckoning's for yourworld,

1608
02:19:17,730 --> 02:19:20,392
- It's not mine,
- (horse whinnies)

1609
02:19:24,203 --> 02:19:27,195
I'l be damned,
He's a hard bastard to kill,

1610
02:19:27,272 --> 02:19:28,637
(Ruby yells)

1611
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:33,476
- (Ada) No!
- Ruby!

1612
02:19:33,545 --> 02:19:35,638
(Ruby groans)

1613
02:19:38,917 --> 02:19:40,441
(Ada) lnman!

1614
02:19:54,166 --> 02:19:55,997
- (yells)
- Captain Teague!

1615
02:19:58,804 --> 02:20:00,533
(Ruby groaning)

1616
02:20:08,414 --> 02:20:09,540
(gun clicks)

1617
02:20:38,110 --> 02:20:42,137
- Come down from there!
- No, sir, Here is fine,

1618
02:20:42,214 --> 02:20:45,206
I'll just shoot the horse out from under you,

1619
02:20:45,284 --> 02:20:48,447
- You ridin' Captain Teague's animal?
- I am,

1620
02:20:48,554 --> 02:20:51,717
- He dead?
- I hope so,

1621
02:20:51,790 --> 02:20:56,159
Look, give me your gun and ride on home,
I'm done fightin', I'm sick of it!

1622
02:20:56,228 --> 02:20:58,719
I give you my gun,
you're gonna shoot me dead,

1623
02:20:58,797 --> 02:20:59,957
I will not shoot you,

1624
02:21:00,032 --> 02:21:03,627
but nor am I goin' down this mountain
lookin' over my shoulder for you,

1625
02:21:03,702 --> 02:21:05,897
That's what they call a conundrum,

1626
02:21:10,309 --> 02:21:14,405
- I'll tell you what I got on my side,
- What you got on your side?

1627
02:21:21,253 --> 02:21:23,084
The confidence of youth,

1628
02:21:38,470 --> 02:21:40,631
Inman!

1629
02:21:57,623 --> 02:21:59,523
(coughs)

1630
02:22:09,134 --> 02:22:10,499
(horse whinnies)

1631
02:22:10,569 --> 02:22:12,560
(Ada sobs)

1632
02:22:31,957 --> 02:22:33,925
No!

1633
02:23:09,695 --> 02:23:10,923
I,,,

1634
02:23:11,797 --> 02:23:14,231
came,,, back,

1635
02:23:23,208 --> 02:23:25,574
I love you,

1636
02:23:48,533 --> 02:23:50,091
(sobs)

1637
02:23:58,710 --> 02:24:00,701
(whispers) Baby,

1638
02:24:26,705 --> 02:24:30,163
(Ada) What we have lost
will never be returned to us.

1639
02:24:31,710 --> 02:24:34,042
The land will not heal.

1640
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:37,940
Too much blood.

1641
02:24:38,050 --> 02:24:41,611
The heart. will not heal.

1642
02:24:41,720 --> 02:24:45,520
All we can do is make peace with the past

1643
02:24:45,590 --> 02:24:47,615
and try to learn from it.

1644
02:24:50,929 --> 02:24:55,491
- What are you doing?
- He died in the night, love,

1645
02:24:56,768 --> 02:24:58,702
Bring him here,

1646
02:24:58,770 --> 02:25:01,898
- Don't kill him,
- I'm not gonna kill him,

1647
02:25:01,973 --> 02:25:06,069
We have to try somethin'
or else he's gonna die too,

1648
02:25:06,144 --> 02:25:09,011
- (bleats)
- It's all right,

1649
02:25:09,681 --> 02:25:12,172
We're gonna try a little trick,

1650
02:25:12,284 --> 02:25:14,752
- (bleats)
- Shh,

1651
02:25:20,392 --> 02:25:22,053
(lamb bleats)

1652
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:24,251
(ewe bleats)

1653
02:25:34,506 --> 02:25:39,671
There are days now
when I manage not to think of you.

1654
02:25:40,112 --> 02:25:45,106
When the needs of the farm
call with more urgency than my heart..

1655
02:25:46,551 --> 02:25:50,544
This time of year
there's so much life everywhere.

1656
02:25:52,557 --> 02:25:54,525
I find you in all of it.

1657
02:25:56,595 --> 02:25:59,587
As if you were still walking home to me.

1658
02:26:02,501 --> 02:26:06,733
If you could see us now
this Easter day at Black Cove,

1659
02:26:06,805 --> 02:26:10,297
you would know
every step of your journey was wort.h it.

1660
02:26:10,375 --> 02:26:14,038
I'm still climbing upwards

1661
02:26:14,112 --> 02:26:17,479
And my journey's almost ended

1662
02:26:17,582 --> 02:26:20,949
(all) So, friend, if you're thirsty

1663
02:26:21,019 --> 02:26:24,477
Climb this mountain with me

1664
02:26:27,659 --> 02:26:31,095
Grace lnman, nobody said "Eat."

1665
02:26:36,535 --> 02:26:39,060
(music ends with a flourish)

1666
02:26:43,875 --> 02:26:48,608
For good friends, good food, good family,

1667
02:26:48,680 --> 02:26:51,808
all our blessings, O Lord, we thank thee,

1668
02:26:51,917 --> 02:26:53,282
- Amen,
- Amen,

1669
02:26:53,351 --> 02:26:54,978
- Amen,
- Amen,

1670
02:26:55,086 --> 02:26:57,611
- (Ruby) Amen!
- (clears throat)

1671
02:26:57,722 --> 02:27:01,419
- Sweetheart, there's no cider,
- (Ada) That's for you,

1672
02:27:01,493 --> 02:27:05,725
Right, I'd best,,,
I'd best fetch it, I got my orders,

1673
02:27:08,834 --> 02:27:12,736
I looked once more down Sally's well,

1674
02:27:12,804 --> 02:27:16,865
and this time
there was nothin' there to haunt me.

1675
02:27:17,876 --> 02:27:19,810
Just clouds.

1676
02:27:19,878 --> 02:27:24,178
Clouds, and then... sun.

1677
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:24,963
("The Scarlet Tide" by Alison Krauss)

1678
02:29:31,343 --> 02:29:36,906
Well I recall his part.ing words

1679
02:29:37,015 --> 02:29:41,782
Must I accept his fate

1680
02:29:41,853 --> 02:29:47,758
Or take myself far from this place?

1681
02:29:47,826 --> 02:29:53,162
I thought I heard a black bell toll

1682
02:29:53,231 --> 02:29:57,998
A little bird did sing

1683
02:29:58,069 --> 02:30:00,867
Man has no choice

1684
02:30:00,939 --> 02:30:05,035
When he wants every thing

1685
02:30:07,512 --> 02:30:13,212
We'll rise above the scarlet tide

1686
02:30:13,318 --> 02:30:19,018
That trickles down through the mountain

1687
02:30:19,090 --> 02:30:26,258
And separates the widow from the bride

1688
02:30:34,172 --> 02:30:39,701
Man goes beyond his own decision

1689
02:30:39,778 --> 02:30:45,546
Gets caught up in the mechanism

1690
02:30:45,650 --> 02:30:51,350
Of swindlers who act like kings

1691
02:30:51,423 --> 02:30:57,191
And brokers who break everything

1692
02:30:57,262 --> 02:31:02,894
The dark of night was swiftly fading

1693
02:31:02,967 --> 02:31:07,836
Close to the dawn of day

1694
02:31:07,906 --> 02:31:14,106
Why would I want him
just to lose him again?

1695
02:31:16,448 --> 02:31:22,250
We'll rise above the scarlet tide

1696
02:31:22,320 --> 02:31:28,122
That trickles down through the mountain

1697
02:31:28,193 --> 02:31:35,531
And separates the widow from the bride

1698

("You Will Be My Ain True Love")

1699
02:31:55,753 --> 02:32:01,589
You'll walk unscathed
through musket fire

1700
02:32:02,760 --> 02:32:08,790
No plowman's blade will cut thee down

1701
02:32:10,068 --> 02:32:16,303
No cutler's horn will mark thy face

1702
02:32:16,374 --> 02:32:22,506
And you will be my ain true love

1703
02:32:22,947 --> 02:32:28,817
And you will be my ain true love

1704
02:32:31,422 --> 02:32:37,258
And as you walk
through death's dark veil

1705
02:32:38,429 --> 02:32:43,867
The cannon's thunder can't prevail

1706
02:32:45,203 --> 02:32:50,800
And those who hunt thee down will fail

1707
02:32:51,543 --> 02:32:57,971
And you will be my ain true love

1708
02:32:58,416 --> 02:33:04,377
And you will be my ain true love

1709
02:33:06,925 --> 02:33:13,387
Asleep inside the cannon's mouth

1710
02:33:13,998 --> 02:33:19,994
The captain cries "Here comes the rout"

1711
02:33:20,605 --> 02:33:26,635
They'll seek to find me nort.h and south

1712
02:33:26,711 --> 02:33:32,980
I've gone to find my ain true love

1713
02:33:35,253 --> 02:33:41,556
The field is cut and bleeds to red

1714
02:33:41,926 --> 02:33:47,694
The cannonballs fly round my head

1715
02:33:48,600 --> 02:33:54,698
The infirmary man may count me dead

1716
02:33:55,106 --> 02:34:01,602
When I've gone to find my ain true love

1717
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:09,851
I've gone to find my ain true love
