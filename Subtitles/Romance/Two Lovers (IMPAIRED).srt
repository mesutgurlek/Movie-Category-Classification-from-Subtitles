Okay.

Anyway, help yourself.

No.

122

It's really cool.

123
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:24,323
MICHAEL: <i>Now they put so many</i>
<i>things in your path.</i>

124
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:27,392
<i>I mean, all the inspections</i>
<i>and all of the licensing</i>

125
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:30,462
<i>and all the-- the different</i>
<i>technology-- the machines.</i>

126
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:32,197
CAROL: <i>It's amazing you can</i>
<i>run a business.</i>

127
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:34,333
You know, my son's been
working with me a little

since he's been back.

00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:44,893
MICHAEL: <i>What about it, Lenny?</i>
<i>Do you like it?</i>

132
00:07:44,894 --> 00:07:46,595
<i>Do you like</i>
<i>the dry-cleaning business?</i>

133
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:49,998
It's all right, you know?
It's good to help out the family.

134
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:52,417
REUBEN: <i>He's a good photographer--</i>
<i>I'll tell you that.</i>

135
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:54,286
- CAROL: <i>Really?</i>
- Yes. Yes yes.

136
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:56,355
Yeah, I gave him
an old camera

137
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:59,257
and now all he does--
he takes pictures all over the place.

138
00:07:59,258 --> 00:08:00,609
MICHAEL:
<i>Really?</i>

139
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,177

- I know what you're thinking.

144
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:11,637
<i>Listen, I have a little</i>

- Oh, thank you.

150
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:24,466
- CAROL: Oh, yeah.
- But we have a photographer,

151
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:27,269
and he's taking the color shots and
he's taking the slides and the set-ups,

152
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,821
but my wife,
the artistic one,

the black and white.

00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,175
- CAROL: Yes, we do.
- Lenny?

155
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:35,894
<i>Do you think you'd be interested
in doing something like that?</i>

156
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,629
Oh, I don't know
about that.

157
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,482
- I mean, I--
- CAROL: <i>Why not?</i>

158
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:41,283
I don't-- I don't really
do impromptu things.

159
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:44,302
- I mean--
- Oh, try. You'll see what happens.

160

MICHAEL:
<i>I'd love to see his stuff--</i>

161
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:49,108
just check it out a little bit.
Do you think I could?

162
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:50,909
Okay.

163
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,928
I'll show you some.

164
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:55,664
Leonard, why don't you show
Sandra your pictures?

165
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:58,134
I don't know if--
you want to see that now?

166
00:08:58,135 --> 00:08:59,751
Yeah, I'd love
to see them.

167

Come on.

- I'll call you for dessert.

171
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,078
Eh?

172
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,134
I wasn't expecting
visitors.

173
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,504
Yeah, you've got
a lot of stuff in here.

174
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:21,006
Yeah.

175
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:23,375
I wasn't planning on being
home for so long, so...

176
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,978
I gotta organize this place.
I don't know what the fuck.

177
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,013
Oh, when--
when did you get back?

178
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:30,015
Uh, about
four months ago.

179
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:31,250
Mmm.

180
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,702
What are we doing?
Oh, yeah-- pictures.

181
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:35,604
You can sit down
if you want.

182
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,105
Okay.

183
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:43,912
- Let's see.
- You have a lot of DVDs.

184
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:46,014
Yeah.
You like movies?

185
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:47,449
Yeah, I love
movies.

186
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,451
Yeah? Like what?
What do you like?

187
00:09:49,452 --> 00:09:52,504
Well, my favorite
movie is probably...

188
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,056
"The Sound of Music."

189
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:57,158
<i>Not because of</i>
<i>the film, really,</i>

190
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,444
but because, you know,
whenever it's on,

191
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:01,930
my family always watches it.
It's that kind of thing.

192
00:10:01,931 --> 00:10:04,466
No, that's a good movie.
It's underrated.

193
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:06,535
Yeah.

194
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:08,020
Can I look at these?

195
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,022
Yeah, those are--
that's a good pile.

196
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:12,757
<i>This is</i>
<i>the garbage pile.</i>

197
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:17,262
Oh, these are nice.

198
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:18,864
<i>Oh, thanks.</i>

199
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:20,599
<i>Yeah, this one I like.</i>
<i>Look at it.</i>

200
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,634
This one's nice too.

201
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:26,188
But you don't have any
people in them really.

202
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:28,273
Yeah, well,
you know.

203
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:30,876
People look at 'em-- they
don't have to be in 'em too.

204
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:32,477
I like this one.

205
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:35,114
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Gotta be in the moment.</i>

206
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:36,831
( laughs )

207
00:10:36,832 --> 00:10:39,534
So what--
what do you do?

208
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:43,955
I work at Pfizer in
the city-- it's a drug company.

209
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,425
Yeah, I know it well.

210
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:49,628
I have some ones with
some people in it.

211
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,397
I was just
going through these--

212
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:55,383
who's-- who's that
in this photo here?

213
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:01,473
Oh, that was-- I don't even
know what that's doing there.

214
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:04,125
That's so weird.
That was my fiancée.

215
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:06,829
- Your fiancée?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

216
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,714
You were engaged.

217
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:11,801
Yeah,
a couple years ago.

218
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,688
She's gone, though.
She moved away.

219
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,740
What happened?

220
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:21,560
You know, um--

221
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:24,246
We got these genetic tests
and we were both positive

222
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:26,615
- for Tay-Sachs disease.
- Oh.

223
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:30,251
It means if we ever had kids, they'd
be, like, dead after a year, so...

224
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:31,737
<i>Yeah.</i>

225
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:33,606
She didn't want to adopt

226
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:36,441
and, well,
that was that.

227
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:39,244
I'm so sorry.

228
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:42,581
Mmm, probably for
the best.

229
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:44,549
RUTH:
<i>Leonard? Sandra?</i>

233
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:54,043
our parents
wanted us to meet.

<i>Well, no, I have to</i>
<i>tell you the truth.</i>

to meet you.

236
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,590
Yeah?

237
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,242
Yeah.

238
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:12,528
I saw you at
your parents' store

239
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:14,462
and I just...

240
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,133
You were asking
your mother to dance with you.

241
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:20,285
<i>It was</i>
<i>very cute.</i>

I would do.

<i>You two, dessert's on the table.</i>

Yeah, we heard you
the first time!

245
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:33,582
Sorry.

246
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,484
She's really serious
about her desserts.

( laughs )

248
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:39,871
We should probably go.
She's...

249
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:42,374
gonna have an aneurysm.

250
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,376
- We'll hang out after.
- Okay.

251
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:47,146
Um, yeah. Okay.
I'm just gonna put this away.

It does?

310
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:10,966
No, it's a good thing.
It reminds me of my grandma's house.

311
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:13,101
Yeah, well, my parents
are just trying to protect

312
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:15,470
all their, you know,
designer clothes and shit.

313
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:17,039
From what?

314
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,457
Mot-- moths.

315
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,275
( laughs )
Right.

316
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:22,844
Right right, moths.
Of course.

317
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:25,314
So you're new
here in the building?

318
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:27,316
Yeah, I just moved in
last week.

319
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,984
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah.

320
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:30,652
Oh, welcome.

321

<i>Thanks.</i>

322

Is your-- is that your bedroom
in the back, in the corner?

323
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:40,045
Oh, yeah, it's right--
it's right there.

324
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:41,779
Right there
to the right.

325
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,965
I can see you
from my apartment.

326
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:45,367
- Ha.
- I'm sure I--

327
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:47,369
I think I've seen you
through my window.

328
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,004
- Yeah?
- Don't worry, it's not, like, a weird thing.

329
00:16:50,005 --> 00:16:52,940
- I'm not worried.
- Okay.

330
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:54,976
Wow, those are nice.

331
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:58,247
<i>What is that, yiddish?</i>

332
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:03,218
So you live
with your father?

333
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:05,237
Uh, no,
he's just visiting.

334
00:17:05,238 --> 00:17:07,506
I live with my dog, Rex.

335
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:11,043
Hey, yeah, you know,
I think I heard him barking.

336
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:13,762
He doesn't sound too happy.
I mean, I don't speak dog.

337
00:17:13,763 --> 00:17:16,147
<i>Yeah, he kind of is.</i>

338
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:19,817
He-- we move a lot and he
doesn't like it when we move.

339
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:21,486
So...

340
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:23,221
He liked Hoboken a lot,

341
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:25,990
<i>which is weird.</i>
<i>But...</i>

342

God, you guys have
a lot of books.

one of those reader guys?

344
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,015
You, like, read all the time?
You're really smart?

345
00:17:34,016 --> 00:17:36,317
- I don't know about that.
- I can see that.

346
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,388
I don't really read
very much, you know?

347
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:43,859
I've got ADHD,
supposedly.

348
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,977
Yeah, they say
everybody has that.

349
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:48,597
I think it's a conspiracy by
the drug companies, you know?

350
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:51,182

hello.

Hey, pop.

Hello.

- No no, you're eating.

- Yeah, I hope so.

<i>Who is that girl?</i>

365
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:40,982
New neighbor--
you met her.

366
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:43,085
<i>I mean, Michelle.</i>
<i>She's new in the building.</i>

<i>I just met her myself.</i>

368

Listen, Leonard, tomorrow
I have a lunch with Cohen.

369

He wants you to take

Hello?

00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:05,874
Yeah.
I heard you, pop.

374
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,241
I'll come.

375
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:08,960
All right.

00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,696
I'm sorry,
all right?

377
00:19:10,697 --> 00:19:12,747
Don't be sorry.

Hmm? You don't want to be late.
Come on, here-- your pills.

384
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:43,495
No, I don't want to be late

She is beautiful.

I was joking.

Mmm. It's good

All right, all right.
Don't get bent out of shape.

Don't leave wet towels

612
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:54,895
You know, he tells me
over and over.

613
00:33:54,896 --> 00:33:56,597
And I never
asked him to do that.

614
00:33:56,598 --> 00:33:59,199
And now I can't think
of anything else.

615
00:34:01,903 --> 00:34:04,772
- I'm such a piece of shit.
- No.

616
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:06,607
Look at me.

617
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:10,544
You're very high right now.
You're very emotional.

618
00:34:10,545 --> 00:34:12,880
You shouldn't think
about this right now, okay?

619
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:15,449
Let's just go home.
I'll take you home, okay?

620
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:16,984
- Ahh.
- You need to calm down.

621
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:19,153
You don't want to be out
here with all these people.

622
00:34:19,154 --> 00:34:21,321
- Okay?
- Okay. Okay.

623
00:34:21,322 --> 00:34:23,323
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

624
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:25,175
We're gonna go home.

625
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:26,843
All right.
I'll be right back.

626
00:34:26,844 --> 00:34:29,079
Okay.

627
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,948
I'll wait--
I'll wait right here.

628
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,117
Ahh, fuck.

629
00:34:33,118 --> 00:34:35,219
Can I just get
my bag?

630
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,621
- I was in before. I left my bag.
- All right, go ahead.

631
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:39,856

I'm so sorry about what happened.

672
00:37:17,265 --> 00:37:19,716
I went back
into the club

<i>and I went into the
bathroom and I passed out.</i>

- What?
- I literally passed out in the bathroom.

675
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:28,909
Yeah, 'cause I waited
outside for, like, 30 minutes.

676
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,778
And they wouldn't let me
back in the club.

- I tried to call you.
- <i>Oh, God.</i>

I didn't know what to do.
I didn't want to leave you.

00:37:34,115 --> 00:37:36,283
I'm so sorry.
It was crazy.

680
00:37:36,284 --> 00:37:38,902
I have to go to the doctor.
I don't know what the fuck.

<i>In a really bad</i>
<i>situation with that guy.</i>

684
00:37:45,493 --> 00:37:47,361
It's horrible.
This guy,

685
00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:49,830
You know, he's a partner
in a law firm where I work.

686
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:52,116
<i>And I got into</i>
<i>this thing now.</i>

687
00:37:52,117 --> 00:37:54,117
<i>You know, he pays</i>
<i>for this apartment.</i>

688
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:57,254
And his mother
lives nearby,

689
00:37:57,255 --> 00:38:00,658
So it's like the excuse
for when he comes out here.

690
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:02,275
Oh, yeah.

691
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:05,045
<i>But you know,</i>
<i>he's not really like that.</i>

692
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,014
<i>He's actually</i>
<i>really amazing.</i>

693
00:38:07,015 --> 00:38:10,184
<i>He's brilliant and</i>
<i>he can be really sweet.</i>

<i>I think</i>
<i>you'd like him.</i>

695
00:38:11,986 --> 00:38:15,906
My friends think he's never going
to leave his wife. What do you think?

696
00:38:15,907 --> 00:38:18,858
<i>I've never met him.</i>
<i>You know, I don't know.</i>

Ah. Well,
you know what, Leonard?

699
00:38:24,032 --> 00:38:27,484
You should come and have
dinner with us tomorrow night.

I should hang out with friends and stuff.</i>

701
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:33,374
<i>This way you could come</i>
<i>and eat with us</i>

702
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:35,726
<i>and then you could,</i>
<i>like, tell me</i>

703
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:37,995
<i>if you think he's</i>
<i>telling the truth, you know?</i>

704
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:41,732
<i>Because you're a guy and then you would
be able to know that kind of a thing.</i>

705
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:44,001
Yeah, I don't know.
I gotta, uh--

706
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,470
I gotta check
my schedule.

707
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,521
You know, I got
a lot to do.

708
00:38:48,522 --> 00:38:51,258
<i>I can't tell if he's</i>
<i>telling me the truth, and...</i>

709

<i>if you came,</i>
<i>it would be so great.</i>

710

I gotta see.

711
00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:59,767
<i>I need this kind of,</i>
<i>you know, help right now</i>

712

<i>You know something?</i>

714

<i>I'll bet you he would take us
to his favorite restaurant.</i>

It's called San Domenico.
It's in the city.

Do you think it would make a difference?

720
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:21,988
I really really really
want you to go.

721

00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:30,144
You're the first
to arrive.

762
00:42:30,145 --> 00:42:33,030
Would you like to wait at
the bar or go to your table?

763
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:34,464
I'll be seated.

764
00:42:34,465 --> 00:42:36,082
Can I take
your coat?

765
00:42:39,454 --> 00:42:41,388
Thank you.
Jeffrey.

766
00:42:42,657 --> 00:42:44,591
This way, sir.

767
00:42:44,592 --> 00:42:46,693
<i>Would you like a drink</i>
<i>while you're waiting, sir?</i>

768
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:50,296
Yes, I'll have
a Brandy Alexander, please.

769
00:43:18,076 --> 00:43:19,993
( texting )

770
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:43,466
Here you go.

771
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:45,368
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

772
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:47,570
Sir, would you
like a straw?

773
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:49,706
<i>I can bring you</i>
<i>a real straw if you'd like.</i>

774
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:51,241
This is perfect.
Thank you.

775
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:52,709
Just...

776
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:10,244
Thanks so much.

777
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:19,119
Hey.

778
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,854
Hi.

779
00:44:20,855 --> 00:44:24,157
- I can't stand up.
- Ron, this is Leonard.

780
00:44:24,158 --> 00:44:25,726
- <i>Nice to meet you.</i>
- Very nice to meet you.

781
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,761
- Nice to meet you too.
- Shall I go, um--

782
00:44:27,762 --> 00:44:29,596
- Shall I go here?
- Yeah, I'll sit here.

783
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:31,097
Oh, okay.

784
00:44:31,098 --> 00:44:32,733
- I'll go around.
- I'm gonna come--

785
00:44:32,734 --> 00:44:36,503
Um, she'll have-- oh, I see you've
got the same thing right here.

786
00:44:36,504 --> 00:44:40,340
Very nice.
Brandy Alexander and a...

787
00:44:40,341 --> 00:44:43,610
Maker's mark
on the rocks, please.

788
00:44:43,611 --> 00:44:45,945
Right away, Mr. Blatt.

789
00:44:45,946 --> 00:44:47,714
Nice to finally
meet you there, Leonard.

790
00:44:47,715 --> 00:44:49,449
Nice meeting you
as well.

791
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,385
So Michelle tells me
you guys are neighbors.

792
00:44:51,386 --> 00:44:53,754
Yeah. Yeah, we live right
across the way from each other.

793
00:44:53,755 --> 00:44:56,323
- Nice. You guys can keep an eye on each other.
- <i>( Michelle laughs )</i>

794
00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:00,660
That's my old neighborhood, actually.
My mom lives out there.

795
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:02,395
- Is that right?
- You go to Totonno's?

796
00:45:02,396 --> 00:45:04,498
- Oh, sure. I know the place.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

797
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:04,986
Good pizza.

798
00:45:04,987 --> 00:45:07,467
<i>It's really great pizza.
A lot of memories there.</i>

799
00:45:07,468 --> 00:45:09,886
So what kind of work
do you do?

800
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:12,572
I work for
my father's company.

801
00:45:12,573 --> 00:45:15,642
Leonard's a photographer.
He's really good.

802
00:45:15,643 --> 00:45:17,144
- Is that right?
- <i>Yeah, really good.</i>

803
00:45:17,145 --> 00:45:18,795
What kind of photography
do you do?

804
00:45:18,796 --> 00:45:22,182
- <i>Fashion?</i>
- Ah, land-- landscapes.

805
00:45:22,183 --> 00:45:24,034
That's great.
That's good.

806
00:45:24,035 --> 00:45:25,568
As long as you love it--

807
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:27,771
As long as you love
what you're doing.

808
00:45:27,772 --> 00:45:30,290
And I think that we should get some
menus. Otherwise, we'll be late.

809
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:31,741
Well, they gave me
a menu already.

810
00:45:31,742 --> 00:45:33,443
I don't know if it's...
( mumbles )

811
00:45:33,444 --> 00:45:36,679
I don't know if Michelle told you--
we've got opera tickets tonight.

812
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,081
Oh, yeah.

813
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:39,566
<i>We try to go as often</i>
<i>as we can.</i>

814
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:41,318
I mean, you know,
I know she loves it.

815
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:42,919
Yeah, but you
like it too.

816
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,721
- I don't force you.
- <i>Of course you don't.</i>

817
00:45:44,722 --> 00:45:46,957
<i>Absolutely, I love it.</i>
<i>But I know how much it means to you.</i>

818
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,425
That's true.

819
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:51,344
<i>You know what the great thing</i>
<i>about it is for me?</i>

820
00:45:51,345 --> 00:45:54,581
- It makes you feel special when you're there.
- Mmm.

821
00:45:54,582 --> 00:45:56,966
<i>I mean, I'm lucky--</i>
<i>my law firm gives me a box.</i>

822
00:45:56,967 --> 00:45:59,385
<i>But I'm telling you something:</i>
<i>If you've got somebody</i>

823
00:45:59,386 --> 00:46:02,155
that you love,

824
00:46:02,156 --> 00:46:04,090
you take 'em to the opera.

825
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,278
<i>Hey, darlin'.</i>

826
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,531
Yeah, I ought to bring
my girlfriend.

827
00:46:11,532 --> 00:46:13,366
That sounds romantic.

828
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:16,302
- What? You have a girlfriend?
- Yeah.

829
00:46:16,303 --> 00:46:18,421
Leonard, you didn't tell me
you had a girlfriend.

830
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:19,655
- I didn't?
- No.

831
00:46:19,656 --> 00:46:21,608
Well, we haven't
been going out that long--

832
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:23,443
That's probably why.
It would've come up.

833
00:46:23,444 --> 00:46:26,280
A man's got to have his secrets, Honey.
Come on.

834
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:29,366
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>leave him alone.</i>

835
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:31,234
I'm going to go
to the ladies' room.

836
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:32,703
<i>Again, baby?</i>

837
00:46:32,704 --> 00:46:34,638
I'll be right back.

838
00:46:42,864 --> 00:46:45,499
<i>Hey, listen,</i>
<i>Leonard.</i>

839
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,033
Come here.

840
00:46:48,736 --> 00:46:52,005
I want you to do me a favor.
I want you to--

841
00:46:52,006 --> 00:46:53,774
I want you to keep
an eye on her.

842
00:46:53,775 --> 00:46:56,059
I want you to look out for her
for me a little bit, if you can.

843
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,144
She in trouble?

844
00:46:58,145 --> 00:47:00,964
I think she might
be using again.

845
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:04,918
I mean, I know I shouldn't
be saying this, but...

846
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:07,270
I mean, I can see
the signs.

847
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:10,440
- I haven't seen nothing.
- Yeah? Sure?

848
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:14,077
I mean, you know, she comes
from a good family,

849
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:16,212
plenty of money.

850
00:47:16,213 --> 00:47:18,415
You know, and her father
goes and spends it all

851
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:20,400
and boom, that's it--
the whole thing goes to hell.

852
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:22,436
So, whatever, just do me
a favor, all right?

853
00:47:22,437 --> 00:47:25,072
Just-- just keep
an eye on her.

854
00:47:25,073 --> 00:47:28,024
Just don't let her get
involved in that kind of thing.

855
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:30,526
Yeah. I don't play
with that shit.

856
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:33,879
I appreciate it.

857
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:36,682

for me to come over, was it?

915
00:51:04,124 --> 00:51:06,275
What?

916
00:51:06,276 --> 00:51:08,278
What do you mean?

917
00:51:08,279 --> 00:51:11,114
It's okay you
didn't call me back.

918
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:13,716
I--

919
00:51:13,717 --> 00:51:16,018
We don't have
to go out.

920
00:51:16,019 --> 00:51:19,188
I mean,

921
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:23,510
There are a lot of
guys who just--

922
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:26,696
That want to
go out with me.

923
00:51:47,435 --> 00:51:49,669
Oh my--
oh my God.

924
00:51:57,611 --> 00:51:59,645
I do like you.

925
00:52:11,225 --> 00:52:12,976
Well, it feels
a little strange

926
00:52:12,977 --> 00:52:15,327

00:53:19,793 --> 00:53:22,311
I should go

931
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:26,282
before your parents come home
and see us like this.

932

Are you kidding?
They'd be happy.

Leonard, what did you think of Ronald?
Tell me.

What-- what do you
want me to say?

968
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:48,540
Do you think he's going
to be with me for good?

Seriously.

970

I don't think so.

00:55:58,585 --> 00:56:00,236
Sorry.

Michelle, come on!
What are you doing?

976
00:56:20,573 --> 00:56:22,708
Come on, seriously.
He's the kind of guy

977
00:56:22,709 --> 00:56:25,244
who's got this
whole life,

978

His family

979

You think he's gonna
leave all that?

I know
I would.

I'd definitely leave
everything for you.

Leonard, you're very sweet,
but I--

983
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:50,119
I think if you knew me better,
you wouldn't feel that way.

984
00:56:51,939 --> 00:56:54,139
I don't care.

Oh!

other for a couple of weeks.

989

But I-- I feel like I
could tell you anything.

990
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,818
You know? I need you
to be my friend.

991
00:57:05,819 --> 00:57:08,287
You know, why don't you
tell Ronald, okay?

992
00:57:08,288 --> 00:57:10,289
Tell Ronald.
Go away on your trip--

993
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:12,191
- <i>Tell Ronald?</i>
- I don't care.

Leonard, where
are you going?

I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

997
00:57:18,782 --> 00:57:20,783
Oh, Leonard,
don't say that.

You're probably sleeping,

my schedule and I'm free.

And, yeah-- see about maybe
going out with you to this party.

1004

So why don't you call me

She miscarried.

01:12:41,554 --> 01:12:43,554
Sorry.
We'll go in a minute.

1225

- Michelle?
- <i>Hey.</i>

1226
01:12:50,162 --> 01:12:52,981
- Hey.
- <i>I just got your text from yesterday.</i>

1227
01:12:52,982 --> 01:12:55,917
Yeah, well, I knew you had your
two-week follow-up thing today.

1228
01:12:55,918 --> 01:12:57,402
How'd it go?

1229
01:12:57,403 --> 01:13:00,371
It went fine. Everything's--
everything's good.

1230
01:13:00,372 --> 01:13:01,773
The doctor says I'm good.

1231
01:13:01,774 --> 01:13:03,008
Good.

1232
01:13:03,009 --> 01:13:04,575
'Cause I didn't
hear from you.

1233
01:13:04,576 --> 01:13:07,029
No, I'm fine. I just
came home and got into bed

1234
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,613
and I've been lazy.

1235
01:13:08,614 --> 01:13:10,732
<i>Listen, Leonard,</i>

1236
01:13:10,733 --> 01:13:13,218
<i>Ron got back</i>
<i>from London today.</i>

1237
01:13:13,219 --> 01:13:15,537
<i>I decided I'm going to</i>
<i>go to his office later</i>

1238
01:13:15,538 --> 01:13:18,673
<i>and I'm just--</i>
<i>I'm just gonna end it.</i>

1239
01:13:18,674 --> 01:13:20,809
Really?
Today?

1240
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,427
<i>Yeah.</i>

1241
01:13:22,428 --> 01:13:25,163
<i>I've been thinking about what
you said and you were right.</i>

he's doing, you know?

1244
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:34,522
It's not fair to me and it's
definitely not fair to his family.

1245
01:13:34,523 --> 01:13:38,059
<i>He still doesn't even know what
happened to me at the hospital.</i>

1246
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:41,296
Well, do you want me to come
with you and wait outside or--

1247
01:13:41,297 --> 01:13:44,198
<i>No, don't worry.</i>
<i>I'll be strong.</i>

1248
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:46,367
<i>Just wish me luck.</i>

1249
01:13:46,368 --> 01:13:47,953
Well, good luck.

1250
01:13:47,954 --> 01:13:50,956
<i>Thanks. </i> I'll text you
<i>after it's over, all right?</i>

1251
01:13:50,957 --> 01:13:52,624
Okay. Bye.

1252
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:01,382
MICHAEL: <i>I haven't seen units</i>
<i>like that in 30 years.</i>

1253
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:03,969
They're ancient.
We gotta get something new.

1254
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:06,655
<i>There are some new</i>
<i>Italian machines</i>

1255
01:14:06,656 --> 01:14:08,373
- <i>they're Tintoretto.</i>
- <i>Tintoretto?</i>

1256
01:14:08,374 --> 01:14:10,475
- <i>Yeah, Tintoretto.</i>
- REUBEN: <i>Leonard?</i>

1257
01:14:10,476 --> 01:14:11,676
Hey, pop.

1258
01:14:11,677 --> 01:14:13,578
Leonard.

1259
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:15,797
Mr. Cohen.

1260
01:14:15,798 --> 01:14:18,299
Reuben, I'm going to
take off. We'll talk.

1261
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,035
All right.

1262
01:14:20,036 --> 01:14:22,203
I'm glad I
caught you, Leonard.

1263
01:14:22,204 --> 01:14:25,406
- Listen, tomorrow...
- Yeah?

1264
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:28,710
...Do you think you could come
by my office, above my cleaners?

1265
01:14:28,711 --> 01:14:31,780
- Yeah.
- I got something I'd like to talk to you about.

1266
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:33,614
- How's noon?
- Uh...

1267
01:14:33,615 --> 01:14:35,483
Well, I think I have
to work tomorrow.

1268
01:14:35,484 --> 01:14:37,018
Go-- go meet
with Michael.

1269
01:14:37,019 --> 01:14:38,887
- The deliveries...
- It's okay.

1270
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:40,372
Okay. Good.

1271
01:14:40,373 --> 01:14:42,123
I'll see you then.

1272
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:44,109
Reuben.

1273
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:46,444
I'll bring a nice bottle
of champagne for--

1274
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:48,713
Oh, no,
we got plenty.

1275
01:14:48,714 --> 01:14:50,015
No, it's my pleasure.

1276
01:14:50,016 --> 01:14:51,216
- Yes, all right.
- Okay.

1277
01:14:51,217 --> 01:14:52,550
- Okay.
- I'll see you at noon.

1278
01:14:52,551 --> 01:14:54,052
All right.

1279
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:57,072
Bye bye.

<i>Hey, pop,</i>
<i>where's mom?</i>

1281
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:01,576
- <i>There's no more Seltzer.</i>
- She's out getting stuff.

1282
01:15:01,577 --> 01:15:05,897
<i>She's having another one of her famous
New Year's parties tomorrow night.</i>

1283
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:14,489
How are you?

1284
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:18,493
Are you happy
these days?

1285
01:15:18,494 --> 01:15:20,294
I'm okay.

1286
01:15:20,295 --> 01:15:23,081
I feel anxious.

1287
01:15:23,082 --> 01:15:24,515
I'm okay.

1288
01:15:26,518 --> 01:15:30,204
I was just talking to--
to Michael.

1289
01:15:30,205 --> 01:15:32,607
I want to make sure
you'll be taken care of

1290
01:15:32,608 --> 01:15:34,675
with the merger
and all this.

1291
01:15:34,676 --> 01:15:38,329
It's why I'm doing it,
so you have a future.

1292
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:41,466
You'll have
your health insurance.

1293
01:15:42,835 --> 01:15:44,920
I appreciate that,
Pop.

1294
01:15:49,408 --> 01:15:53,010
I'm going swimming in the ocean
with Polar Bear Club

1295
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:54,646
On New Year's day.

1296
01:15:54,647 --> 01:15:57,165
Be careful
out there.

1297
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:59,434
I will.

What? Somebody is sending
you something here?

1300
01:16:06,225 --> 01:16:09,176
Yeah, it's just
my friend.

1301
01:16:09,177 --> 01:16:12,113
All right.
I forgot to do something.

1302
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:14,716
I'll clean this up
later, all right?

1303

Hey.

I just got
your text.

1305

You all right?

1307
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:50,618
It's over.
I did it.

1308
01:16:53,289 --> 01:16:56,858
He yelled and screamed
but I did it.

1309
01:16:56,859 --> 01:16:58,960
Sorry.

1310
01:16:58,961 --> 01:17:01,096
It's so fucked up.

1311
01:17:04,633 --> 01:17:07,035
I'm so lost, Leonard.

1312
01:17:10,256 --> 01:17:13,425
I have this friend
in San Francisco.

1313
01:17:13,426 --> 01:17:16,794
She's going away for a while
and she said I could

1314
01:17:16,795 --> 01:17:19,831
go out and stay at
her place.

1315
01:17:19,832 --> 01:17:22,233
So I'm gonna go out there

1316
01:17:22,234 --> 01:17:24,235
and figure things out.

1317
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:30,892
Don't go.

1318
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:39,467
I love you.

1319
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:44,372

Leonard--

I know you may not
want to hear it,

1323

but it's true.

1324
01:17:55,467 --> 01:17:57,852
Leonard, you don't
love me, okay?

1325
01:17:57,853 --> 01:18:00,088
- Don't say that.
- I'm completely fucked up.

1326
01:18:00,089 --> 01:18:02,123
Don't say that.
I'm not a little kid.

1327
01:18:02,124 --> 01:18:05,826
This isn't some
stupid fucking crush.

1328
01:18:05,827 --> 01:18:09,097
You think I don't
know love?

1329
01:18:09,098 --> 01:18:11,416
I was supposed to
get married.

1330
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:14,102
Her parents are the ones
that called it off

1331
01:18:14,103 --> 01:18:16,454
because of
this medical thing and...

1332
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,509
then she went away.

1333
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:27,415
I couldn't find her.

1334
01:18:30,986 --> 01:18:34,572
And I tried to hurt myself and
they put me in the hospital.

1335
01:18:34,573 --> 01:18:36,724
And I--

1336

I didn't--

1337
01:18:44,032 --> 01:18:46,734
I didn't think that
I'd ever

love anyone again.

1339
01:18:54,593 --> 01:18:56,978

I love you.

You--

1343
01:19:09,909 --> 01:19:12,743
You think if I got to know
you that I wouldn't love you,

1344
01:19:12,744 --> 01:19:16,130
but I do know you and
I love you even more.

1345
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:18,433
I understand you,
Michelle.

1346

I'm fucked up too.

1347
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:30,061

walk away from you.

Never.

1349

He left you.
I'd never do that.

1350
01:19:36,918 --> 01:19:39,204
I'll take care
of you

because that's
what you deserve.

1352
01:19:43,693 --> 01:19:46,144
You deserve
to be loved.

learn to love me too.

Happy New Year.

1531
01:32:01,913 --> 01:32:04,214
- Leonard! You look so good.
- Yeah?

1532

Will you both hurry up?

<i>( laughing )</i>

1537
01:32:28,823 --> 01:32:31,892
- Hi!

1538
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:33,877
<i>Hi!</i>
<i>There's lots of food.</i>

- RUTH: <i>I'll be right back.</i>

1540
01:32:37,933 --> 01:32:39,950
Leonard?

1541
01:32:40,919 --> 01:32:42,369
Are you leaving?

1542
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,893
I saw on the computer that you
checked travel sites last night.

1543
01:32:52,463 --> 01:32:54,765
<i>You're going</i>

I have to go, Mom.

1547
01:33:09,164 --> 01:33:12,015
But you don't even
have a bag.

1548
01:33:12,016 --> 01:33:14,818
I threw it
out the window.

1549
01:33:17,622 --> 01:33:20,707
You don't have to
worry about me.

1550
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:22,843
I'm gonna be okay.

1551
01:33:34,622 --> 01:33:36,640
I love you
very much.

I know you do.

1553
01:33:41,045 --> 01:33:42,946
This is your home.

1554
01:33:42,947 --> 01:33:45,682
You come back here
whenever you want. Mmm?

1555
01:33:47,869 --> 01:33:51,188
Tell Papa that
I'm sorry.

1556
01:33:51,189 --> 01:33:55,809
And I hope I didn't
mess things up.

1557
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:58,428
And that I'm happy.

1558
01:33:58,429 --> 01:34:00,998
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.

1559
01:34:02,317 --> 01:34:04,852
We want you happy.

01:34:04,853 --> 01:34:06,286
I love you.

1561
01:34:06,287 --> 01:34:08,222
Thanks, Mom.

1562
01:34:08,223 --> 01:34:10,190
I have to go.

( dialing )

1564
01:34:47,779 --> 01:34:50,013
Uh, Michelle,
it's Leonard.

1565
01:34:50,014 --> 01:34:53,183
I'm downstairs.
It's 8:05.

1566
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:55,252
Call me or I'll see you
down here. All right.

1567
01:34:55,253 --> 01:34:56,420
Bye.

Please come down.

1572
01:36:12,213 --> 01:36:14,564
I was just calling you.

1573
01:36:14,565 --> 01:36:16,867
The car's out front
waiting.

1574
01:36:20,438 --> 01:36:22,139
I'm not going.

1575

<i>I'm not going.</i>

1576
01:36:28,563 --> 01:36:31,598
He left his family
for me.

1577
01:36:31,599 --> 01:36:35,051
He told
his wife everything.

1578
01:36:35,052 --> 01:36:38,272
He says he wants
to get married.

1579
01:36:38,273 --> 01:36:42,593
<i>I finally let him know</i>
<i>about my miscarriage</i>

You're such
a wonderful person.

1583
01:36:52,587 --> 01:36:54,921
<i>But he left them for me.</i>

1584
01:36:54,922 --> 01:36:58,359
<i>You know, I've got to</i>
<i>give it a chance.</i>

1585
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:01,729

Just go.

I'm so sorry.

1589
01:37:10,255 --> 01:37:12,272
Go!

What's going on?
Where were you?

Yeah?
