1
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:47,328
JANE: <i>If someone had asked me</i>
<i>not long ago...</i>

2
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:51,088
<i>... why I thought men left women</i>
<i>and never came back...</i>

3
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,085
<i>...I would have said this:</i>

4
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:55,402
<i>New cow.</i>

5
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:59,685
<i>The New Cow Theory was born</i>
<i>of a broken heart.</i>

6
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,489
<i>It came to me while reading about male</i>
<i>behavior in</i> The New York Times...

7
00:01:04,693 --> 00:01:07,605
<i>... which chronicled</i>
<i>a fascinating study...</i>

8
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:11,209
<i>...on the mating preferences</i>
<i>of the male cow.</i>

9
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:16,170
<i>First, a bull was presented with...</i>

10
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,685
<i>...a cow.</i>

11
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:20,601
<i>They mated.</i>

12
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:28,212
<i>The next day, the bull</i>
<i>was presented with the same cow.</i>

13
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:34,401
<i>The bull wasn't interested.</i>
<i>He wanted New Cow.</i>

14
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:36,962
<i>And this was Old Cow.</i>

15
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:46,282
<i>To see if they could trick the bull,</i>
<i>scientists used an ingenious ploy.</i>

16
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:51,563
<i>The Old Cow was smeared</i>
<i>with New Cow scent.</i>

17
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:55,206
<i>But he was no fool.</i>

18
00:01:56,013 --> 00:02:00,291
<i>This wasn't New Cow.</i>
<i>This was just Old Cow incognito.</i>

19
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:05,881
<i>Old cow in sheep's clothing.</i>
<i>Mutton dressed as lamb.</i>

20
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:14,563
<i>I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

21
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:18,283
<i>To understand the theory</i>
<i>and how it took over my life...</i>

22
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:21,007
<i>...you need to hear</i>
<i>the whole story.</i>

23
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:26,969
<i>When I met Ray, I was booking talent</i>
<i>for</i> The Diane Roberts Show...

24
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:30,888
<i>...a New York talk show</i>
<i>that had just been syndicated.</i>

25
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:35,484
<i>We'd been given a small window</i>
<i>of opportunity to prove ourselves.</i>

26
00:02:35,693 --> 00:02:39,686
We're back with Mary Lou Corkle,
conservative activist...

27
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:43,687
...who's here to talk about her
new book, <i>The Nest Crisis.</i>

28
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:46,282
One of your central arguments...

29
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:50,486
...is to blame society's problems
on working mothers.

30
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:53,293
JANE: <i>Diane wanted to reach</i>
<i>her audience...</i>

31
00:02:53,493 --> 00:02:56,690
<i>...by appealing to both their</i>
<i>understimulated brains...</i>

32
00:02:56,933 --> 00:03:00,084
<i>...and their overstimulated</i>
<i>appetite for tabloids.</i>

33
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:03,922
Ambition's blinded these women
to familial duties.

34
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:09,082
So, doing what l do makes me
unfit for motherhood.

35
00:03:09,293 --> 00:03:11,602
We make our own beds, don't we?

36
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,370
That is true.
Who makes your kids' beds...

37
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:20,089
...while you've been out selling
your book these past three months?

38
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:23,524
JANE: <i>My job was to supply</i>
<i>a steady diet of raw meat...</i>

39
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:26,128
<i>...to sate Diane's</i>
<i>Emmy</i>-<i>clad ambitions.</i>

40
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:30,724
Hi, Donald, we've gone national.
We've started a new format.

41
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,931
Major exposure.
lt's perfect for Hillary.

42
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:37,768
She'd be among the first.
Trust me, everyone wants on.

43
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:43,966
JANE: <i>My only colleague was writer,</i>
<i>producer and womanizer, Eddie Alden.</i>

44
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:47,483
-How we doing?
-Publisher's having a coronary.

45
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:50,207
-That good?
-You book them, l cook them.

46
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:52,244
Right on. Yeah.

47
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:55,570
Thank you, we're talking
to Mary Lou Corkle....

48
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:59,891
Any progress with Cuba?
Well, just keep trying.

49
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:04,126
This Castro thing's gonna kill me.
She won't let it go.

50
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:08,605
-Forget Castro. Get a creative angle.
-Such as?

51
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:11,688
-Elena de la Goya.
-Who?

52
00:04:11,893 --> 00:04:15,522
One of the women the ClA hired
to kill him in the '60s.

53
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:19,567
-This is a smoke-free building.
-Blow me.

54
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:23,925
The ClA created a ''scent of death''
oil that smelled like perfume.

55
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:26,767
She'd wear it, he'd kiss and lick--

56
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:30,761
-Don't editorialize.
-Sorry. He was supposed to croak....

57
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:34,682
JANE: <i>Eddie could find the sex factor</i>
<i>in almost any subject.</i>

58
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:37,009
<i>He considered this a gift.</i>

59
00:04:37,253 --> 00:04:41,087
-You forgot these earrings.
-You don't waste any time.

60
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,812
-Cynic.
-Slut.

61
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:46,125
JANE: <i>If Eddie was enough</i>
<i>to make me lose hope in men...</i>

62
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:49,370
MAN: Got a minute?
-<i>...it only took one to bring it back.</i>

63
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:53,009
EDDlE: Hey, Ray.
-We haven't met yet. l'm Ray Brown.

64
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:59,004
EDDlE: Our new executive producer.
-From Washington.

65
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:03,767
l saw your piece for <i>Newsline.</i>
That was brilliant.

66
00:05:03,973 --> 00:05:07,852
Thank you. We just did a follow-up.
That's why l'm late.

67
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:11,443
l'd better scoot.
Jane, want me to turn up the AC?

68
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:13,689
You look a little flushed.

69
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:16,121
Okay.

70
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:19,569
-Jane Goodale.
RA Y : l know.

71
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:23,601
lnteresting. People must
confuse you with the scientist.

72
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:26,532
-They ask if l'm into chimps.
-Are you?

73
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:32,293
-Maybe Curious George when l was 5.
-He was a monkey, not a chimp.

74
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,889
-He knows his primates.
-l do. See you around.

75
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:39,011
l heard Lynne Cheney's people
are difficult.

76
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:42,051
They fear it'll turn
into an abortion debate.

77
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:45,131
-Which is right.
-Of course.

78
00:05:45,373 --> 00:05:50,288
Say Diane won't bring it up, and plant
someone to initiate it during Q and A.

79
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:53,326
You came to the right show, Ray Brown.

80
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,208
WOMAN: So he's cute?
JANE: Very.

81
00:05:58,413 --> 00:05:59,687
WOMAN:
Care to elaborate?

82
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:04,404
Pale blue eyes, athletic,
sort of J. Crew, but not as preppy.

83
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:07,929
-That guy again.
-You gonna buy anything or not?

84
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,733
-Shush, l'm concentrating.
-Okay.

85
00:06:11,293 --> 00:06:13,443
-Marital status?
-Girlfriend.

86
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:17,441
-Why are we having this talk?
-Right. lt's too much work.

87
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:21,692
Even if l were up for it,
he'd probably end up marrying her.

88
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:25,408
Wow! There's the cynical bitch
l know and love.

89
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:28,532
Case closed.
l'm leaving this one alone.

90
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:33,482
-Feeling carnivorous?
-Absolutely.

91
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,767
What else should l know about you?

92
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:41,771
Apart from your addiction
to processed foods...

93
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:44,487
...much to the chagrin
of your girlfriend...?

94
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,486
Dee.

95
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:49,688
Whom you've been dating now for...?

96
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:52,481
-Three years.
-Three--

97
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:56,084
Excuse me.
Three years. Wow.

98
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:02,688
That's more serious than l would
have guessed, you know, off the cuff.

99
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:09,923
l guess. Think you'll ever get to the
moment where you just know it's right?

100
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:15,488
That's it? That's the person
you're meant to be with forever?

101
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:20,286
Probably.

102
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,089
JANE:
<i>God, he was cute.</i>

103
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:28,088
JANE: lt's me!
WOMAN: We're in here.

104
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,371
-Just jab it in!
-Don't rush me!

105
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:34,963
-What's going on?
-Your sister started on injections.

106
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:38,768
-Of orange juice?
-Fertility drugs, Jane.

107
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:41,083
The orange is for practice.

108
00:07:42,453 --> 00:07:46,526
lf you can't stick it into a Valencia,
what about my ass?

109
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,043
lf it's not done right,
we'll lose another month.

110
00:07:57,973 --> 00:08:01,488
-That's supposed to be my job.
-See how easy it is?

111
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:06,164
This is an emotional time and you're
sucking the romance out of it.

112
00:08:06,373 --> 00:08:12,323
We kissed romance goodbye when you
started jacking off into a cup weekly.

113
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:14,882
STEPHEN:
Leave my sperm count out of it!

114
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,892
Chubby Hubby?

115
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,726
ALlCE: l'll look at the
dirty magazines with you.

116

Very nice! Very grown up.

At least one of us is.

118

Morning.

119
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,484
Don't bother.
l already know you're an asshole.

120
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:46,684
You always complain about your
small place. Move in with me.

121
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,004
-You can't be serious.
-Why not?

122
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:52,888
l only meet hip successful types.
l want someone like you.

123
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:56,529
-Gee, thanks.
-This would be strictly financial.

124
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:59,810
-l've no interest in you that way.
-What a relief.

125
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:02,129
-ls that a no?
-Actually, it's a:

126
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:05,683
''Thanks, but not if my life
depended on it.''

127

-Hello.
RA Y : <i>You up for a walk?</i>

129
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,091
-What?
-What?

130
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,689
l was just gonna--

131
00:09:58,493 --> 00:10:00,882
l can't speak.
You say something.

132
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,887
No, no, don't.
Do you think l'm insane?

133
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:08,692
Not at all.

134
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:16,965
l was thinking how good
my place looks with you in it.

RECEPTlONlST : <i>M Magazine.</i>
-Let's start again.

136
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:50,610
You ate Cocoa Puffs,
then a couple cartoons....

137
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:53,686
-A <i>Tweety</i> and a <i>Road Runner.</i>
-<i>Then more kissing.</i>

138
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:55,764
-<i>Right.</i>
-Okay, go on.

139
00:10:56,013 --> 00:11:00,723
We got ready for work. l walked
him to the door and-- Morning.

140
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,650
-Big finale-type kiss before leaving?
-Exactly.

141
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:09,125
-That's good. Very good, considering.
-Considering what?

142
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:11,682
Considering he's picked out his wife!

143
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:15,323
l told you, they're having problems.
They're not engaged.

144
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:21,489
Yet. He sounds like a prospect,
so here's what you do.

145
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:25,489
<i>Pretend she doesn't exist.</i>
<i>Never mention her name.</i>

146
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:29,328
-<i>If he mentions her, you nod politely.</i>
-Why?

147
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:35,125
lf you bring her up, he'll feel pushed.
This way it's like, ''No pressure.''

148
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:38,206
-<i>It'll drive him nuts.</i>
-Where do you get this?

149
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:41,924
Snag-men-dot-com.
lt's very informative.

150
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:43,572
-God.
-<i>Read the papers.</i>

151
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:47,601
Twenty-three-year-old women
are lying about their age.

152
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:51,323
Miss ''l have a crush so l'm in denial, ''
get on your game!

153
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:57,205
What do l do now when l see him
in my staff meeting in five minutes?

154
00:11:57,453 --> 00:12:00,251
That's easy.
Pretend he doesn't exist.

155
00:12:03,293 --> 00:12:04,567
Good morning, Eddie.

156
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:14,412
-What is on your neck?
-l bit myself shaving.

157
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:18,492
-lsn't that why God made turtlenecks?
-lt's why God made Darlene.

158
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:20,251
You are so gross.

159
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:22,689
-Hey, Eddie. Hi, Jane.
EDDlE: Hey, Ray.

160
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:24,446
Hey, Ray, good morning.

161
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:31,682
You okay? You look a little tired.

162
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,088
Evelyn. Straw.

163
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:38,492
Okay. l'm late.
l know. l'm sorry.

164
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:44,126
l locked myself out of the apartment.
Nightmare. The only reason l'm here...

165
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:47,763
...is because of Habib.
Nicest cabdriver in this city.

166
00:12:48,013 --> 00:12:52,928
-Who saw ABC's 4 a.m. newscast?
-l think a lot of us missed that.

167
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:58,531
lt told how single media outlets aren't
working. Where are we on interactive?

168
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:03,767
-The web site should be up Monday.
-Not should be, will be!

169
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:09,929
We cannot sell this show on the budget
they gave. We need streaming 24/7.

170
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:13,882
And we need to make every show count.
Remember...

171
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:17,045
-...it is all about the get.
-The get.

172
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:22,290
We cannot make a splash if we get
the gets everybody's already gotten.

173
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:24,922
-l need the ungettable get.
-Got it.

174
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:26,606
Good.

175
00:13:26,853 --> 00:13:29,003
Okay, where are we on Fidel?

176
00:13:30,613 --> 00:13:34,447
l spoke with Juanita,
his foreign press secretary...

177
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:37,527
...who assured me that the moment...

178
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:41,971
<i>...el presidente</i> was back
from his fantasy baseball camp...

179
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:45,888
-...she would ask him about it.
-Did she imply interest?

180
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:50,685
DlANE: Did she discuss availability?
Do we have a shot?

181
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:53,563
-Jane!
-Sorry.

182
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,964
What do you think your chances
are of getting him?

183
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:02,292
l think they're good, Diane.
l think they're very good.

184
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:38,565
Just a minute.

185
00:14:56,213 --> 00:15:01,526
Sorry. l thought
l'd just do a few sit-ups.

186
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:26,930
Joy: the emotion evoked by the
prospect of possessing one's desires.

187
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:34,566
Rapture: the experience of being
carried away by emotion or passion.

188
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:44,485
Ecstasy: a state of being
beyond reason and self-control.

189
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,491
l cannot feel my legs.
Tell me what we're doing.

190
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:52,206
We're coming up for air.

191
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:56,890
-Besides l owe you a shirt.
-Hey, that's a good idea.

192
00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:58,608
-Blue?
-Yeah.

193
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:03,131
This one's pretty.
With your eyes.

194
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:07,889
Could be risky, given your
impatience with buttons.

195
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:13,324
-l love it.
-My treat.

196
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,847
No, no, no, Jane--

197
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:19,285
-Shut up. Let me buy you a shirt.
-Thank you.

198
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:23,005
-Hey, guys.
-Eddie! Hey.

199
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:25,289
-What are you doing?
-l just....

200
00:16:25,493 --> 00:16:27,643
-She's helping me pick a shirt.
-Yeah!

201
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:32,842
-Well, l didn't mean to intrude.
-Not at all, please.

202
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:38,292
l gotta go to a thing.
Great running into you.

203
00:16:38,493 --> 00:16:40,848
-Both of you! My God.
-See you.

204
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:43,487
-All right.
-Okay.

205
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:48,087
What a coincidence. First l run
into Ray, and then you.

206
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:52,690
l didn't even know he lived
around here and there he is!

207
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:58,329
Okay, so l am sleeping with him.

208
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:01,565
lf you tell anyone at the office,
so help me God....

209
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:04,961
What are you thinking?

210
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,488
l'm thinking the same thing you are.

211
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:13,284
Happily ever after with your
matching Volvos and chocolate Labs.

212
00:17:13,573 --> 00:17:17,407
-See you Monday.
-Did you have friends growing up?

213
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:20,081
l think he's waiting down the street.

214
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:38,284
l love you, Jane.

215
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:46,808
l love you too.

216
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,847
LlZ:
He just said it after only six weeks?

217
00:18:57,093 --> 00:19:00,722
Oh, my God. lt takes most guys
a year to use the ''L'' word.

218
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:05,489
When they do, they're usually
on top of you, so it doesn't count.

219
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:09,126
-What about Dee?
-He's telling her tomorrow.

220
00:19:09,373 --> 00:19:12,604
-Why didn't he already?
-lt's complicated.

221
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:17,369
lf he had second thoughts, l don't
think he'd ask me to live with him.

222
00:19:17,613 --> 00:19:21,447
He asked you to live with him?
My God. What did you say?

223
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:26,528
Yes. He started calling realtors,
and l gave my landlord notice.

224
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:33,165
Wow! <i>Mazel tov.</i>
l can't believe this!

225
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:38,885
You're getting asked to play house,
and l'm on hell's blind-date circuit.

00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:42,086
-l take it last night didn't go well.
-Awful.

227
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:47,691
When Julian offers one of his straight
friends, shoot me before l say yes.

228
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,924
l'm in a sad state.

229
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:54,884
And l'm telling you, it's just
screaming ''potential.'' Hello?

230
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,402
-l didn't mean to intrude.
-We're fine.

231
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,524
Didn't you want to see the patio?

232
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:04,893
lsn't it just wonderful? Wait till
you see the view, it's spectacular.

233
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:07,482
Right down to the World Trade Center.

234
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,088
lt's such a jewel box.

235
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:23,411
l guess l'll leave you two alone
to talk things over.

236
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:27,366
-Oh, my God. lt's unbelievable.
-l love it!

237
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:30,491
The light is so good.
l love you.

238
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:35,970
l don't know.

239
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:43,611
l gotta go.
He looks like he's been hit by a bus.

240
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,730
l'll call you back.

241
00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:52,364
-l feel like l've been hit by a bus.
-You told her?

242
00:20:56,533 --> 00:21:00,082
-Was it bad?
-Not like l thought.

243
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:05,287
l mean, she didn't go hysterical
or anything like that.

244
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:11,290
She was just, you know, eerily calm
about the whole thing.

245
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:15,486
-Well, that's good, right?
-Yeah. l just meant--

246
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:20,892
-lt wasn't what l expected, is all.
-What did she say about us?

247
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:27,521
l didn't tell her.
l just didn't think it was necessary.

248
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:32,563
To hit her over the head with this
after three years, it just seemed...

249
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:35,885
...so awful. l just told her
that it was over.

250
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:38,886
And l think that's all
she needs to know.

251
00:21:39,093 --> 00:21:42,802
Sure. And she was okay with that?

252
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:48,047
l guess. l don't know.
lt was weird. She just kind of....

253
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:52,851
You know,
she just kind of went cold on me.

254
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:55,692
l mean, she's upset.

255
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:59,483
She's upset, the poor thing.
She's gotta be upset.

256
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:04,568
She didn't seem terribly upset so....

257
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:07,486
-Well, you're okay with it, right?
-Mm-hm.

258
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:13,289
-l mean, you're happy?
-Happy.

259
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:17,082
l am so happy.
l mean, this is what l wanted.

260
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:21,008
l mean, there's nothing
between us anymore.

261
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:24,051
That's what l was looking for,
so l'm happy.

than l had recalled.

Oh, well, gotta force it.

we have to sign the lease by Monday.

The poor guy wouldn't have time.

00:24:47,293 --> 00:24:50,285
-Us.
-What?

295
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:53,690
Why?

296
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:58,086
-l don't know?
-What do you mean, you don't know?

297
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:02,884
-There has to be a reason. Tell me.
-Jane, l'm sorry.

298
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:06,449
You deserve an answer,
and l don't think l can explain.

299
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:11,813
l thought we felt the same way:

300
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:17,650
lncredibly lucky to have
found the thing.

301
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:21,886
-l do. l did.
WAlTRESS: And here you go.

302
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:32,206
l just think that we both
need to take a step back.

303
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:38,169
l mean we're talking about
a very serious move here.

304
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:42,522
l just wanted--
l still....

305
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:50,486
-l don't know what l'm trying to say.
-l feel like such a jerk.

306
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:56,612
-Believing that this was--
-Listen to me, l love you.

307
00:25:57,573 --> 00:26:00,246
l want us to be important
to each other.

308
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:03,282
Please don't do that.

309
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,891
Please go.

310
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:42,004
JANE: <i>There are few things sadder</i>
<i>in this life...</i>

311
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:45,928
<i>...than watching someone walk away</i>
<i>after they've left you.</i>

312
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:51,486
<i>Watching the distance between your</i>
<i>bodies expand until there's nothing...</i>

313
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:55,885
<i>...but empty space and silence.</i>

314
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:06,288
Remember, time wounds all heels.

315
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:20,922
Hi.

316
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:28,088
-Are you all right?
-Why, don't l look all right?

317
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:32,411
-You look like you hate my guts.
-l do.

318
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:34,291
That's nice.

319
00:27:35,573 --> 00:27:39,771
l don't blame you.
This hasn't been easy for me either.

320
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:43,085
Yeah, you look really destroyed.

321
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:49,005
Eddie, did you by any chance
ever find a roommate?

322
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:51,403
Well, no, actually.

323
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:55,487
The place l was supposed to move into
suddenly fell apart.

324
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:59,481
My apartment's been re-rented.
ls the offer still good?

325
00:28:00,453 --> 00:28:04,366
-You're moving in with Eddie?
-What's the apartment like?

326
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:08,003
lt's a two-bedroom. Kitchen.
Lots of windows. Living room.

327
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,687
That sounds amazing.
When can l see it?

328
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:13,606
-You're moving in with Eddie?
-How about tonight?

329
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:18,085
Perfect.
Everything is just perfect.

330
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:26,724
-You okay?
-Yeah.

331
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:36,007
-Here it is.
-lt's huge.

332
00:28:36,253 --> 00:28:41,691
Yep. Here's the kitchen,
living room, whatever.

333
00:28:41,893 --> 00:28:45,283
My bedroom, bathroom,
this'd be your room.

334
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:52,163
What happened here?

335
00:28:52,413 --> 00:28:56,725
l got the urge to renovate.
l'd have it fixed before you moved in.

336
00:28:56,973 --> 00:29:00,204
-You want a drink?
-Sure, some water.

337
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:04,332
-We don't share a bathroom, do we?
-l never use the bathroom.

338
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:08,487
So how'd you find this place?

339
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:11,805
My ex-girlfriend worked
in an emergency room.

340
00:29:12,053 --> 00:29:16,524
When someone died she'd check their
address, see if it was rent control.

341
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:19,924
-You lived with somebody?
-Yeah.

342
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:21,891
For how long?

343
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,768
For a while.
So what do you think?

344
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:28,686
l think l must be out of my mind.

345
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:43,082
Hey!

346
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:46,482
Shit.

347
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:59,283
Morphine for the pain.

348
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:15,682
Hey.

349
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:21,690
lt was right after she moved out.

350
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:32,010
l just took an ax
and started hacking away at it.

351
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:37,486
As if l thought opening up that wall
might make it easier to breathe.

352
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:40,288
l don't smoke.

353
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:55,573
Whoa, girl.

354
00:31:57,973 --> 00:31:59,292
You okay?

355
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:03,685
Oh, yeah.

356
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:07,530
What was her name?

357
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:15,883
Rebecca.

358
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:20,722
Put your shoes on,
we're going downstairs.

359
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:23,885
-What's downstairs?
-You'll see.

360
00:32:27,533 --> 00:32:29,489
JANE:
There are two realities:

361
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:34,403
First, we're in love
and it's incredible, it's perfect.

362
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:38,931
Then poof! ''Sorry, Jane,
doesn't work for me anymore.''

363
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:42,921
-How's that possible?
-You were living a fantasy.

364
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:48,844
Romance, true love, soul mates.
lt's all bullshit.

365
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:53,490
None of it exists.
Trust me, l speak from experience.

366
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:59,808
Man, she really did
a number on you, didn't she?

367
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:02,243
Don't shit on my broken heart...

368
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:07,049
...because you've converted to
a warped brand of romantic atheism.

369
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:11,485
Oh, man, whoo.
lt's called self-preservation.

370
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:15,971
ln other words, you narcotize
yourself with casual sex.

371
00:33:16,173 --> 00:33:20,769
That implies l avoid reality
when, in fact, l embrace it.

372
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:26,691
-Casual sex is very liberating.
-l'll bet.

373
00:33:34,133 --> 00:33:37,967
-l almost feel sorry for her.
-What for?

374
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:44,803
l make no pretenses. lf she puts me up
on a white horse, it's her choice.

375
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,893
We're all grownups here, Jane.

376
00:34:02,293 --> 00:34:06,172
JANE: <i>I lay awake that night</i>
<i>wondering which was worse:</i>

377
00:34:06,373 --> 00:34:10,685
<i>Guys like Ray who blinded you</i>
<i>with charms and promises.</i>

378
00:34:11,813 --> 00:34:15,522
<i>Or the Eddies who went</i>
<i>right for your pants.</i>

379
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:17,925
Oh, excuse me.

380
00:34:18,173 --> 00:34:21,563
<i>In the end, it didn't matter.</i>
<i>The truth was...</i>

381
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:25,482
<i>...they were all cast</i>
<i>from the same mold.</i>

382
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:27,889
<i>But the question remained.</i>

383
00:34:28,173 --> 00:34:29,686
<i>Why?</i>

384
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:33,530
<i>One day by the river,</i>
<i>I found my answer.</i>

385
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:38,485
Holy shit.

386
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:46,961
l told them dumbasses it'd
never work. You can't fool a bull.

387
00:34:47,173 --> 00:34:50,370
He knows where he's been.
He won't go back.

388
00:34:50,573 --> 00:34:55,772
Hell, l got 93 cows.
Only one of them got 'nads. Why?

389
00:34:56,013 --> 00:35:00,291
Because that son of a bitch
can knock up the whole herd.

390
00:35:00,493 --> 00:35:03,246
But once he's done, the party's over.

391
00:35:03,453 --> 00:35:07,969
l gotta go to Ed Hickey's place
and trade him for a new one.

392
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:12,530
There ain't a chance
he'll touch any of them cows again.

393
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:17,204
-l figured it out. l'm the Old Cow.
-l don't get it.

394
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:20,769
Remember laughing at the
graffiti on the subway?

395
00:35:20,973 --> 00:35:24,966
-''l love the toilet you sit on?''
-''l hate banging the same woman.''

396
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:31,043
-lt was true, a window into their--
-Schizophrenic behavior.

397
00:35:31,253 --> 00:35:36,122
The New Cow Theory and ''l hate banging
the same woman.'' Same thing.

398
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:40,849
Men can't commit because,
eventually, we all become Old Cows.

399
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:46,605
We're identified as already serviced,
so they seek less familiar females.

400
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:50,647
-The whole novelty thing?
-Neophilia, to be precise.

401
00:35:50,853 --> 00:35:56,007
-What do you think?
-l think it's always about you.

402
00:35:56,253 --> 00:36:00,166
You fall for a guy,
men are worthy of heroic worship.

403
00:36:00,373 --> 00:36:03,683
You're dumped,
they're commitment-phobic asses.

404
00:36:03,893 --> 00:36:08,887
The entire universe doesn't
revolve around your romantic status.

405
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,685
You're in love.

406
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:22,805
-l'm almost in love. Almost.
-Oh, honey, why didn't you tell me?

407
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:28,292
-You're having a spectacular mope.
-Oh, my God!

408
00:36:28,493 --> 00:36:33,886
We met at a work party a couple
of weeks ago. lt's just incredible.

409
00:36:34,093 --> 00:36:38,211
And he's so and--
And l'm so and--

410
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:43,248
JANE: <i>I appreciated Liz's intoxication</i>
<i>over her seeming good fortune...</i>

411
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,762
<i>...but I refused to be derailed.</i>

412
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:51,969
<i>Now armed with my New Cow Theory,</i>
<i>I became voracious for information.</i>

413
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:22,883
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

414
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,489
-Hey!
-What's this?

415
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:29,971
-''Amygdala, a.k.a. erotic nose-brain.''
-Give it back!

416
00:37:30,173 --> 00:37:34,451
''An organ in the nasal cavity
connecting smells to memories.

417
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:39,522
Banana slugs,
actually hermaphrodites...

418
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:44,648
...while mating, the males
chew each other's penises off.''

419
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,086
l worry about you, l really do.

420
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:21,090
JANE: <i>Despite my conviction,</i>
<i>there was the occasional setback.</i>

421
00:38:21,853 --> 00:38:25,641
-l want my erotic nose-brain removed.
-Pardon?

422
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:30,529
My amygdala, the organ in the
nasal cavity that processes scent...

423
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:34,169
...which connects to memory.
l'd like it extracted.

424
00:38:34,373 --> 00:38:37,763
Why voluntarily
make yourself anosmatic?

425
00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:42,569
Let me see if l can explain this.
l had this boyfriend.

426
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:47,963
And he smelled really, really good.
Like soap...

427
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:51,085
...fresh laundry and vanilla.

428
00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:57,167
Every time l smell those smells,
l'm reminded of how happy we were...

429
00:38:57,373 --> 00:39:01,491
...before he dumped me for no reason.
And l get very sad.

430
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:04,446
Then l get angry,
and before l know it...

431
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:08,043
...l'm in the throes
of an emotional breakdown!

432
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:13,486
So l was thinking, Doctor Kline,
if l could short-circuit my nose...

433
00:39:13,693 --> 00:39:18,050
...l'd have a chance to live
a seminormal life someday.

434
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,052
Hey, wait!

435
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:06,492
-Couldn't sleep?
-No.

436
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:08,092
Me neither.

437
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:12,890
-This happen to you a lot?
-Yeah.

438
00:40:14,573 --> 00:40:15,801
Me too.

439
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:34,686
-Just like eating worms.
-Yeah.

440
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:43,492
Talent. These are good.

441
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:45,852
Here.

442
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:49,851
Head back.

443
00:40:56,573 --> 00:40:57,562
Yeah?

444
00:40:57,773 --> 00:40:59,684
-Good.
-Good.

445
00:41:05,893 --> 00:41:08,088
Cold dumplings, my favorite.

446
00:41:09,453 --> 00:41:14,083
-Way to go, Tomcat. Two points.
-Tomcat?

447
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:18,490
-Cheerleader.
-What?

448
00:41:19,053 --> 00:41:21,442
-l was a cheerleader.
-You were?

449
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:25,851
Paul G. Blazer High.
Pride and joy of Cincinnati.

450
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:30,285
-State champs, 1989. Go, Cats.
-Go, Cats.

451
00:41:30,493 --> 00:41:32,723
-Well, show me. Go on.
-No.

452
00:41:32,933 --> 00:41:35,970
-Why not?
-l haven't done it in 10 years.

453
00:41:36,173 --> 00:41:39,529
-Show me.
-Do something that merits a cheer.

454
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:45,091
Like...three dumplings.
Left-handed, in a row.

455
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:50,009
-You can't do that.
-Deal? Deal.

456
00:41:50,213 --> 00:41:55,446
One. Two. Three. Like that?

457
00:41:55,653 --> 00:42:00,124
Come on. Go on. Go on.

458
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:04,212
-Do you promise not to laugh?
-No. Come on.

459
00:42:13,773 --> 00:42:16,048
-What are those?
-Pom-poms.

460
00:42:17,293 --> 00:42:18,487
Okay.

461
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:22,889
-l hate you.
-lt's okay.

462
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:30,529
Ready? Okay.

463
00:42:30,773 --> 00:42:34,891
The Tomcats are here
to show--

464
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:45,203
Ready? Okay.

465
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:49,810
The Tomcats are here
to show who's top!

466
00:42:50,053 --> 00:42:54,365
You think you can beat us,
but we can't be stopped!

467
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,047
Go, Tomcats!

468
00:42:58,173 --> 00:43:00,892
-First and ten--
-Eddie?

469
00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:03,322
Oh.

470
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:12,292
l'm Jane. Roommate.

471
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,852
-lsabel.
-Nice to meet you.

472
00:43:16,053 --> 00:43:20,490
-You can clean up, it's your turn.
-Okay. Good night.

473
00:43:21,173 --> 00:43:23,084
We're a little noisy.

474
00:43:31,373 --> 00:43:33,489
Hi, George, it's Jane--

475
00:43:37,733 --> 00:43:41,567
l sensed things were off
when he got back from L.A...

476
00:43:41,773 --> 00:43:46,847
...but l thought he was tired.
Then he says France isn't a good idea.

477
00:43:47,053 --> 00:43:50,932
He'll have to work the whole time.
Still, no big deal.

478
00:43:51,133 --> 00:43:55,570
So he gets on a plane and goes alone.
Right? Wrong.

479
00:43:55,813 --> 00:43:58,930
An hour ago, l call to say good night.

480
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:02,284
Guess who answered,
1:00 a.m., Paris time?

481
00:44:02,653 --> 00:44:06,248
-Penelope Pope.
-Who's Penelope Pope?

482
00:44:06,453 --> 00:44:09,763
She's the answer to:
''Who the fuck is this?!''

483
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:13,727
-Oh, God, Liz, l'm sorry.
-l don't get it!

484
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:18,961
Why feed me all that romantic crap
if he's just gonna cheat?

485
00:44:19,173 --> 00:44:22,210
-Two words: copulatory imperative.
-What?

486
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,412
The biological urge to spread seed.

487
00:44:26,693 --> 00:44:29,082
Less than 5%of male animals
are monogamous.

488
00:44:29,293 --> 00:44:33,764
-The other 95%are....
-Plugging Penelope Pope.

489
00:44:43,693 --> 00:44:44,682
RA Y :
Hi, Jane.

490
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:48,842
l stopped by H and H
and picked up...

491
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:54,571
...a sesame seed bagel,
lightly toasted, just like you liked.

492
00:44:59,853 --> 00:45:00,968
Okay.

493
00:45:09,493 --> 00:45:15,932
l hope Ray's cold turns into pneumonia
and bed rest causes abs to atrophy.

494
00:45:20,773 --> 00:45:25,847
Ben wants a women's column. lt hit
him, 20%of our readers are female.

495
00:45:26,053 --> 00:45:28,487
The idea is for it to be about men.

496
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:32,481
How they're paranoid
about going bald and whatnot.

497
00:45:32,693 --> 00:45:34,365
-So?
-Forget baldness.

498
00:45:34,573 --> 00:45:38,566
The real issue is their behavior,
their copulatory impulse.

499
00:45:38,773 --> 00:45:44,166
-lmperative. More hot water, please.
-l think you should write it.

500
00:45:44,373 --> 00:45:46,762
-Are you crazy?
-Well, why not?

501
00:45:46,973 --> 00:45:52,047
-l'm not a writer or a psychologist.
-So? We need someone with experience.

502
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:55,325
Liz, l don't know what
l'm talking about.

503
00:45:55,573 --> 00:45:59,088
l just have notebooks
filled with ridiculous facts.

504
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:05,209
This is not a full-time job.
lt's a sick, twisted, pathetic hobby.

505
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:08,650
So get paid to write
about your obsession.

506
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:11,651
lf you want,
we'll give you a pen name.

507
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:18,406
lt'd be cathartic for you. Do your
dear, sweet friend a huge favor.

508
00:46:21,093 --> 00:46:22,731
Pen name, huh?

509
00:46:28,613 --> 00:46:32,492
-l'm doing this once. One time.
-Fine. lt'll be fun.

510
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:36,925
l'm concocting the background
of a nonexistent scientist...

511
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:41,684
...about to publish her delusional
theories in a men's magazine.

512
00:46:41,893 --> 00:46:44,282
You're right. This is fun.

513
00:46:44,733 --> 00:46:50,729
Okay, try this. Born in Sussex, 1937.

514
00:46:52,013 --> 00:46:58,043
Cofounder of the lnstitute of
Pathological Narcissism in Vienna.

515
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:11,127
Who is she?

516
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:15,451
The recently deceased Harriet Gould.
No surviving relatives.

517
00:47:15,653 --> 00:47:19,487
-She's perfect. She even has a bun.
-That's her.

518
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:24,929
Dr. Marie Charles. Oh, my God.

519
00:47:57,053 --> 00:48:01,968
Every bull begins a relationship
with aces up his sleeve.

520
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:06,365
Tools of seduction
by which he lures a New Cow.

521
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:11,164
One of the most notorious examples
is the Current Cow Sob Story.

522
00:48:11,373 --> 00:48:14,763
JANE: <i>Allow me to deconstruct</i>
<i>the essential elements:</i>

523
00:48:14,973 --> 00:48:20,001
You're so easy to talk to.
Not like my Current Cow.

524
00:48:20,213 --> 00:48:22,488
The Myth of Male Shyness:

525
00:48:22,693 --> 00:48:26,447
You think he's flattering you?
He's flattering himself.

526
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,725
Showing how sensitive
and honest he is.

527
00:48:32,053 --> 00:48:39,528
l just try so hard. l'm sure she
doesn't mean to be a Cold Cow.

528
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:42,884
ln case you think he's
a cold-hearted womanizer...

529
00:48:43,093 --> 00:48:47,245
...he'll say this to show he's
leaving his Cow for a reason...

530
00:48:47,453 --> 00:48:50,763
...and he's tormented
by the thought of leaving her.

531
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:54,204
What do they say about
the love of a good woman?

532
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:58,770
JANE: <i>That, once offered, it'll</i>
<i>come back and bite her in the ass.</i>

533
00:48:58,973 --> 00:49:00,531
<i>Enter: case in point.</i>

534
00:49:00,733 --> 00:49:05,011
-Hey, you're not with what's-her-name?
-Didn't work out.

535
00:49:05,213 --> 00:49:10,890
Get a little saddle sore on your
white horse? So, what happened?

536
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:16,770
-Lost interest.
-What do you mean? How exactly?

537
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:20,683
Do we really have to have
another postmortem?

538
00:49:20,893 --> 00:49:26,684
l'm just curious is all. So you went
to a movie? Then back to her place?

539
00:49:27,533 --> 00:49:28,886
Then what?

540
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:33,368
We're in the kitchen,
and she's looking for food.

541
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:37,566
We'd had dinner after the movie,
but she's still hungry.

542
00:49:37,773 --> 00:49:43,291
-She's always hungry, it seems.
-And that's bad? Women who eat?

543
00:49:46,773 --> 00:49:52,484
You're in the kitchen, she's hungry
again, inexplicably. Then what?

544
00:49:53,013 --> 00:49:56,005
So she takes out
a pint of Häagen-Dazs...

545
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,725
...then starts eating it, standing
there, out of the container.

546
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:05,484
-Something about it turned me off.
-Was the refrigerator door open?

547
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:08,293
-Why?
-Answer the question.

548
00:50:08,493 --> 00:50:12,691
-lt was open, l think.
-Would it matter if it were shut?

549
00:50:12,893 --> 00:50:17,489
Would that have made a nonfat woman
eating ice cream less revolting?

550
00:50:17,693 --> 00:50:23,370
What if she were hungry before shoving
her face into a trough of Häagen-Dazs?

551
00:50:23,613 --> 00:50:25,888
ls using a dish less repulsive?

552
00:50:26,093 --> 00:50:30,086
-Good night, you psycho!
-Good night, you neophiliac!

553
00:50:34,853 --> 00:50:39,244
You sitting down?
Oprah read the article on her show.

554
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,366
The audience loved it. She's begging
for Dr. Charles to be a guest!

555
00:50:43,853 --> 00:50:46,765
-What?!
-<i>Everyone in PR has a different story.</i>

556
00:50:46,973 --> 00:50:50,090
She's in Hong Kong,
she's in Tangiers....

557
00:50:50,293 --> 00:50:53,285
-This is bad.
-<i>No, this is all good.</i>

558
00:50:53,493 --> 00:50:58,362
Trust me. l've got it under control.
This won't come anywhere near you.

559
00:50:58,573 --> 00:51:00,928
''While the male may seem shy...

560
00:51:01,173 --> 00:51:05,769
...with his Uriah Heep hand-wringing
and 'Aw, shucks' toe-kicking...

561
00:51:05,973 --> 00:51:10,763
...he is actually a narcissist
because this apparent shyness...

562
00:51:10,973 --> 00:51:13,771
...belies the more
deeply rooted feelings...

563
00:51:13,973 --> 00:51:17,488
...of unworthiness
and fear of rejection.

564
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:21,732
And this is what compels him
to constantly seek attention...

565
00:51:21,973 --> 00:51:27,286
...from New Cow after New Cow,
ad nauseam, ad infinitum.''

566
00:51:27,493 --> 00:51:29,563
This is such great stuff.

567
00:51:29,773 --> 00:51:34,801
lt destroys any sentimentality we have
about what noble creatures men are.

568
00:51:35,013 --> 00:51:39,165
Here's what we're looking for.
lt's provocative, it's clever.

569
00:51:39,373 --> 00:51:41,364
lt's got mass appeal.

570
00:51:41,573 --> 00:51:46,408
But nobody can find this woman.
<i>The Today Show's</i> tried, Oprah's tried.

571
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:49,281
-And have you tried?
RA Y : Eddie?

572
00:51:49,533 --> 00:51:54,891
-Well, no.
-Do you know what we're talking about?

573
00:51:56,053 --> 00:52:00,285
-The ''ungettable get.''
ALlCE: l don't care what it takes.

574
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:05,482
You find that Dr. Marie Charles
and bring her to my studio.

575
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:10,164
Your friend works at <i>M,</i> and she has
no idea where the doctor is?

576
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:13,012
-That's what she said.
-l don't buy that.

577
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,966
EDDlE: Why are you holding out on me?
JANE: l'm not.

578
00:52:16,213 --> 00:52:18,169
-Give me her number.
-No.

579
00:52:18,373 --> 00:52:22,082
Besides, you'd never reach her.
She's at Jivamukti.

580
00:52:22,293 --> 00:52:23,931
-Yoga.
-Yoga what?

581
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:26,084
Jivamukti.

582
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:32,166
-Manhattan. Jivamukti.
-Eddie!

583
00:52:32,413 --> 00:52:37,282
-lt's a yoga place.
-Eddie, don't be a jerk.

584
00:52:41,573 --> 00:52:45,566
Eddie, come on, this is so ridiculous.

585
00:52:45,773 --> 00:52:49,083
You have to leave your shoes in here.

586
00:52:52,093 --> 00:52:54,846
Liz? Excuse me, is--?

587
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:59,484
Jerk, she's my best friend.
l'd know if there's anything--

588
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:00,887
Jane?

589
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:04,292

About six months ago,
my boyfriend tried to leave me.

l was devastated. l was destroyed.

-Right.

everything around me falls apart.

01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:45,902
Everything that l have worked
my entire life for.

-Do you love him?
-Who?

761
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:50,389
Him. The guy.

762
01:08:52,070 --> 01:08:56,268
-l don't know.
-Yes, you do. Have you talked to him?

Well, no, not exactly talked.

Do it. Do it.
Talk to him.

765
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:10,706
l used to feel that if l
kept my heart to myself...

766
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:13,908
...if l never expressed
how much l needed him...

767
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:18,063
...he would never leave me.
Well, guess what? He did.

pathetic puddle.

l went to him with two corned beef
sandwiches on rye, lightly toasted.

And l told him that
l was lost without him.

...to an exclusive phone interview.

896
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:09,747
And l consider it a rare gift
from someone whose work...

897
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:14,228
...has meant a tremendous amount
in my life, as l'm sure yours.

898
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:17,461
Dr. Marie Charles.

899
01:22:18,830 --> 01:22:21,663
<i>Hello, Dr. Charles. Are you there?</i>

900
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:24,260
<i>Hello, Dr. Charles, can you hear me?</i>

901
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:27,261
l'm not getting anything.

902
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:33,548
-Where the hell is she?
DlANE: <i>We have a technical difficulty.</i>

903
01:22:33,830 --> 01:22:36,060
<i>We'll get it worked out.</i>

904
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:43,062
-Patch it through on another line.
-We only have one dedicated line.

905
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:52,784
-Take us to commercial.
-She's here. She wants to go on.

906
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:55,944
Hold that, hold that.
She's here.

907
01:22:56,190 --> 01:23:01,787
lt seems the reason we've been unable
to get through telephonically...

908
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:07,383
...is because she's here, having
decided to do the interview in person.

909
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:10,861
-Holy shit.
-<i>Let's not waste any more time.</i>

910
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:12,907
Welcome Dr. Marie Charles!

911
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,868
-A little makeup. Just a little.
-Stop! Stop!

912
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:22,146
DlANE:
Show yourself, Dr. Charles.

913
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:26,588
Wake up!

914
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:35,500
What? Where's Dr. Charles?

915
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:42,098
There's no Dr. Charles.
There never was.

916
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:47,865
l invented her, Diane.

917
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:55,819
l invented her because
l had something to say.

918
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,786
And somehow l thought...

919
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:06,466
...if it were coming from a 65-year-
old Ph.D., you'd see it the way l had.

920
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:11,864
As a truth, as a legitimate,
scientific truth.

921
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:18,462
But it isn't.
lt's completely ridiculous.

922
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:25,263
l lied to you all, and l lied
to myself because...

923
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:27,862
...the real truth is...

924
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:34,987
...that l was heartbroken and lost.

925
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:38,702
<i>And I just wanted</i>
<i>to understand it somehow.</i>

926
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:43,148
l wanted it to be about them.

927
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:47,469
So everything l thought l had figured
out was completely upside-down.

928
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:51,709
l thought that this bull had gone to a
New Cow, but she was an Old Cow.

929
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:57,464
What was l talking about?
l was comparing men to animals.

930
01:24:58,310 --> 01:25:01,507
Which, let's face it,
sometimes they are.

931
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:06,066
But sometimes they are not.

932
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:12,661
Sometimes you open the barn door,
or the hospital room door...

933
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:15,067
<i>...or the bedroom door...</i>

934
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:22,460
...and you find the real thing.
You find a guy who...

935
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:28,628
...sits with you when you're at
your worst, knee-deep in Kleenex...

936
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:34,063
...and your face looks like
a punching bag and you're a mess...

937
01:25:36,230 --> 01:25:39,267
...and he can still look at you
and tell you...

938
01:25:39,510 --> 01:25:44,186
...that Ray is not the last man
you're ever going to love.

Minus a few gray hairs

l'm really sorry, Eddie.

-You should have told me.
-l should've told you a lot of things.

You were right.

lt was about my nature.

Of everything you said to me
that night, what scared me most...

...is that l would find it again.
