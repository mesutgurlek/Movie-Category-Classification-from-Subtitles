Not anymore.

He did the math and realized that Washington
is the place where there'd be a chance.

10
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:22,066
We should go.
We should go to Washington.

47
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:01,218

The church actually made...

56
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,513
shirts out of hair.

57
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:41,416
So if you wore it,
you could atone

58
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,753
just a little for your sins.

59
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,523
I know what a hair shirt is.

60
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:48,524

- You don't know shit.

69
00:08:17,662 --> 00:08:19,766

70

82

84

172

just make things worse.

Don't.

184
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:31,025
Hey, we can make it together.

185
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:35,064
But we can only
make it together.

186
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:45,139

Not this.

We don't know who left it.

192

If that's a trap, we already
happen to be in it.

But I, for one, would like to
think it is indeed from a friend.

They put something in it?

It might.

231
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:13,658
- That's giving up.
- It's reality.

232
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,065
Until we see otherwise, this
is what we have to live with.

233
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:35,188
When I was a kid...

234
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:39,155
I asked my grandpa once if he ever
killed any Germans in the war.

235
00:32:43,023 --> 00:32:44,655
He wouldn't answer.

236
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:49,425
He said that was
grown-up stuff, so...

237
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,031
so I asked if the Germans
ever tried to kill him.

238
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,669
But he got real quiet.

239
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:11,582
He said he was dead the minute
he stepped into enemy territory.

240
00:33:15,456 --> 00:33:18,058
Every day he woke up

241
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,760
and told himself,
"Rest in peace.

242
00:33:20,762 --> 00:33:22,662
Now get up
and go to war."

243
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:29,503
And then after a few years
of pretending he was dead...

244
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:35,279
he made it out alive.

245
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,951
<i>That's the trick of it, I think.</i>

246
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:44,389
We do what we need to do

247
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,991
and then we get to live.
