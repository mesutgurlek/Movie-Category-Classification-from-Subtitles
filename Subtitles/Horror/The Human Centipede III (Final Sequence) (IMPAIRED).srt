- I'm gonna give you
one last chance

675
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,593
and if you don't like
what you hear

676
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,328
then I'll quit myself!

677
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,066
- Uh-huh.

678
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:49,672
- Mr. Tom Six!
It's so great to meet you.

679
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:52,007
My name's Daisy, uh, I was
wondering if you could sign

680
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:53,676
an autograph for me
before you go in.

681
00:51:53,678 --> 00:51:55,578
- Sure, babe.
- Thank you.

682
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:58,747
You're even more
handsome in person.

683
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,249
- Thanks.

684
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,419
- Uh, let me show you in.

685
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:07,490
Gentlemen, Mr. Tom Six.

686
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,595
- Ah, Mr. Six,
it's nice meet you.

687
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:14,630
- Hello, sir.
- My name is Dwight Butler.

688
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,799
This is my boss,
Mr. Bill Boss.

689
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:18,334
- Sir.

690
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,203
- Please take a seat.

691
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:24,940
- First of all, Mr. Six,
I'd like to say

692
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,309
congratulations on your movies.

693
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,112
They've become
a... a cultural mime.

694
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:32,581
I mean, there is
the "South Park" episode

695
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,583
of the Human Centipede.

696
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:38,687
And then there's the LA porn
parody, and the cat toys.

697
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:42,491
- I don't have
the time for this..

698
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,660
Fan shit shat.

699
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:46,328
[knock on door]

700
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,534
- Well, I'm sorry I'm late.

701
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:56,772
Prisoner 297 had a heart attack

702
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:59,175
and I had to resuscitate
him again.

703
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:02,778
But, um, he's stable now.

704
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,082
I.. Mr. Six, this is a big
pleasure 'cause I'm a big fan!

705
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:10,486
- Uh, thank you sir.

706
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:11,921
[groans]

707
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:13,756
<i>- Well, we are gathered</i>
<i>here today.</i>

708
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:15,824
Glad to investigate
the possibility

709
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:21,263
of applying Mr. Six's human
centipede idea to our prison.

710
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:23,933
I mean, is it
100% medically accurate?

711
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:29,605
- This is<i> my</i> desk!

712
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,609
In my headquarters!

713
00:53:33,611 --> 00:53:36,445
At my penitentiary!

714
00:53:36,447 --> 00:53:37,813
Wake up!

715
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:41,850
We're not in a movie
here playing some idiots!

716
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:44,186
- Well, it is 100%
medically accurate.

717
00:53:44,188 --> 00:53:46,488
I consulted a real surgeon
in Amsterdam

718
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:49,091
and he made a very detailed
operation report for me

719
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,626
and he said he could
actually make

720
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:52,761
a human centipede
in his hospital.

721
00:53:52,763 --> 00:53:55,598
I brought the, uh,
operation reports

722
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,366
and the drawings..

723
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:00,836
So maybe you can
have a look at that?

724
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,414
[clears throat]

725
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,515
- Okay, uh..

726
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:15,251
- What do you think, doc?

727
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:20,155
- Well, from what I see here,
uh, it looks..

728
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:22,258
Medically accurate.

729
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,592
- You're sure?

730
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:26,795
- You would have to give
anti-rejection medication

731
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,964
and there is always
the risk of infection

732
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:31,433
during the healing
process, but, uh..

733
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:36,005
Yeah, I'm sure.

734
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:38,007
- But what about the excretia?

735
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:41,610
- Well, the feces wouldn't be
contaminated by outside bacteria

736
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,345
because it would be going from

737
00:54:43,347 --> 00:54:45,080
one digestive tract to another.

738
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:47,249
So it wouldn't be harmful.

739
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:50,319
But there wouldn't be
much nutritional value.

740
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:54,857
On the other hand if you gave
a series of, uh, injections

741
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:57,459
of fluids with plenty
of vitamins and minerals

742
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,296
I don't see why
someone couldn't survive

743
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:02,598
a lifetime in this position.

744
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,034
- Aah! Gentlemen.

745
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:09,672
[instrumental music]

746
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:14,243
This is a historical moment.

747
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:20,416
This is beyond
medieval torture!

748
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:23,452
Beyond castration!

749
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:28,324
The ultimate correction
nationwide.

750
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:34,196
We have business
on hand, gentlemen.

751
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,964
We start immediately.

752
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,800
- No, the surgery can't be done

753
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:40,269
like in Tom Six's movies.

754
00:55:40,271 --> 00:55:42,771
We have to take into account
of the fact that

755
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,039
at the end of their sentence

756
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,974
the prisoners have
to be released

757
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:48,610
<i>without being mutilated.</i>

758
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:52,081
So I've been
thinking about this.

759
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:55,918
What we have is instead of
the pulling of the teeth

760
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,954
we have a gastro-intestinal
bite-ring

761
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,624
that holds the mouth open,
so they can't stop the feces

762
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,927
from coming into their system.

763
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:08,630
Instead of the cutting
of the knee ligaments

764
00:56:08,632 --> 00:56:10,466
we simply inject

765
00:56:10,468 --> 00:56:13,669
to induce temporary paralysis
in that joint.

766
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,772
Then, to attach the head

767
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:19,475
to the buttocks
of the person in front

768
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:22,111
<i>we have a system</i>
<i>of leather straps</i>

769
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:25,748
which can be adjusted,
pulled in tight and then undone

770
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,583
for when we release.

771
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:32,020
<i>At the end of their sentence</i>
<i>and taken out of the centipede</i>

772
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:35,691
<i>there's only a slight scar</i>
<i>round their mouth and anus.</i>

773
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:43,599
Well, doctor,
what do you think?

774
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:45,267
Is it possible?

775
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:48,103
- Very clever, Mr. Butler.

776
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:51,707
But this, all of this
is beginning to be

777
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:56,111
in serious conflict
with my Hippocratic oath.

778
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:01,583
If I back out of this,
I'm gonna get fired, aren't I?

779
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:06,021
- Very clever thinking,
Mr. Jones.

780
00:57:06,023 --> 00:57:08,424
- You know, my original idea
for the Human Centipede films

781
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:10,993
was sewing a child molester's
mouth to the anus

782
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:14,129
of a fat truck driver, as
a punishment, so I love this.

783
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:16,298
- I just got
an even better idea

784
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,702
for our life-time-trash
and the death-row-scum.

785
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:26,141
But I'll talk
to my loyal doctor first.

786
00:57:26,143 --> 00:57:31,113
- Gentlemen, you may use my human
centipede idea, but on one condition.

787
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:34,583
I have witnessed all the fake
latex stuff on my movie sets.

788
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:38,153
Now I insist on attending
one of your real

789
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:40,322
<i>mouth to anus operations.</i>

790
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:43,258
- Deal.

791
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,330
I put you in charge
of the whole operation, doctor!

792
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:53,035
Soon you'll lead..

793
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:57,940
Surgical teams all over
the States.

794
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,810
- Fantastic!

795
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:06,081
Uh, we are going to need
a much bigger surgical team.

796
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:09,151
We have to run blood workups
on all the prisoners,

797
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:11,854
uh, test their stool samples
for parasites.

798
00:58:11,856 --> 00:58:13,889
- Whatever you need, doc.

799
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:21,096
I've another brilliant idea.

800
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:26,768
We'll show the cockroaches
the two Human Centipede films

801
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:33,308
back to back
at their monthly film night

802
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,612
and then..

803
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:40,082
I'll announce them their fate.

804
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:43,752
- The prisoners will tear
this place apart.

805
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46,989
We have to do this without the
fore knowledge of our clientele.

806
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,426
- Shut up, pooper.

807
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:59,935

- Yo, what the fuck is this?

- This trash occupies a world

where the stars don't shine.

814

- Swallow.

did you like these films?

829

I handpicked them for you

only once.

928
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:57,472
We start

929
01:07:57,474 --> 01:08:00,141

930
01:08:00,143 --> 01:08:02,043

- Ligamenta patellae.

932
01:08:05,148 --> 01:08:08,616
Paralyzing the ligaments
of your kneecaps.

933
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:11,619
So knee-extension

934
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:14,089
is no longer possible.

935
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:18,259
Your lips and anuses

936
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,862
are cut circular
along the border

937
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:24,165
between skin and mucosa,
the muc...

938
01:08:24,167 --> 01:08:26,034
- Mucous-cutaneous.

- Mucous-cutaneous zone.

940
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,473
Then we combine

941
01:08:31,475 --> 01:08:34,809
those circular mucosa
and skin parts

942
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:37,178
of anus and mouth

943
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:41,249

944
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:45,687

your gastric systems.

946
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:51,493
Put them to sleep.

947
01:09:01,705 --> 01:09:03,471
- By the way,
what are your plans

948
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,574
for the life sentenced
and death row prisoners?

949
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,746

How's it going, doc?

951
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:23,091
- Right on schedule,
five surgical teams

952
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:24,259
working round the clock.

953
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:26,528
Those teams creating
centipede segments

954
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:29,597
of three prisoners each,
which are then taken outside

955
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,766
to the hospital tents

956
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:34,602
and then they are sewn
into the final

957
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:37,205
larger human centipede chain.

958
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:40,808
- Marvelous, doc.

959
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,844
- Since I have you here..

960
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:47,749
What do you want to do
with this prisoner?

961
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,417
He has Crohn's disease.

[farting]

963
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:53,688
- What the fuck
is Crohn's disease?

964
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:57,292
- It's an inflammatory
bowel disorder.

965
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:59,327
The prisoner has
constant diarrhea.

966

Revenge is so sweet.

980
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:51,913
Take it into your sleep.

981
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,482

Maybe it's a fake.

992
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:41,362
With Mexicans, you never know.

No fake.

No way to integrate him, doc?

996
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:54,842
- His rectum is sewn shut, no.

997
01:11:58,281 --> 01:12:00,114

998

Continue to cooperate.

1001

01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,922
The both of you
are fucking fired.

1175
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:56,990
I should have done it years ago.

1176
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,495
- All problems
are history, sir.

1177
01:25:01,497 --> 01:25:03,797
I took your advice.

1178
01:25:03,799 --> 01:25:06,433
I've learned
from your strong personality.

1179
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:07,868
<i>You are the ultimate leader.</i>

1180
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:10,003
<i>You are my role model.</i>

1181
01:25:10,005 --> 01:25:12,106
And now the prisoners

1182
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:14,441
are like obedient slaves

1183
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,610
begging for mercy.

1184
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,580
I got them down on their knees.

1185
01:25:19,582 --> 01:25:23,117
Literally.

1186
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:27,087
Your last visit inspired me

1187
01:25:27,089 --> 01:25:29,289
to such an extend

1188
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:32,326
a brilliant idea!

1189
01:25:34,196 --> 01:25:36,363
I'll show you the result

1190
01:25:36,365 --> 01:25:39,333
that tells more
than a thousand words.

1191
01:25:40,436 --> 01:25:44,171
The last ones have
just been attached.

1192
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:49,443
So it is show time.

1193
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:51,945
- Attached?

1194
01:25:51,947 --> 01:25:53,914
Attached?

1195
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:56,750
A-T-T-A-C-H-E-D, attached?

1196
01:25:56,752 --> 01:25:58,919
<i>- Yes.</i>
- What does that mean?

1197
01:26:00,923 --> 01:26:02,489
- Wait and see.

1198
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:06,126

your ass must get jealous.

The black panther

1205

made it to the lead!

1206
01:26:48,437 --> 01:26:50,604
This burger-killer is feeding

1207
01:26:50,606 --> 01:26:53,774
the whole humanitarian
system behind him.

1208
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:55,275
Don't cry.

1209
01:26:55,277 --> 01:26:57,611
Tomorrow, you'll get
your hamburgers.

1210
01:26:57,613 --> 01:27:00,080
[laughs]

1211
01:27:00,082 --> 01:27:01,081
- Why?

1212
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:03,784
- Because he loves junk food.

1213
01:27:03,786 --> 01:27:05,018
- No, no, I don't mean that.

1214
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,955
I mean, what..

1215
01:27:07,957 --> 01:27:09,356
What is this?

1216
01:27:11,293 --> 01:27:13,460
- Dwight..

1217
01:27:13,462 --> 01:27:16,029
Tell the governor my vision!

1218
01:27:16,031 --> 01:27:18,498
And this black whiner here

1219
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,868
has to become a middle piece.

1220
01:27:22,605 --> 01:27:24,271
Fuck!

1221
01:27:24,273 --> 01:27:25,639
- Well, sir

1222
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:29,309
more than 50 billion dollars
a year are spend on corrections.

1223

- But, not anymore.

1228
01:27:43,292 --> 01:27:46,293
This human-prison centipede

1229
01:27:46,295 --> 01:27:48,929
will reduce crime dramatically.

1230
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:51,498
It will be
a deterrent to anyone

1231
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,268
considering a career in crime

1232
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:56,470
and no more recidivism.

Dwight!

1259
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:36,036
Tell our beloved governor

1260
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,571
about the money savings!

1261
01:29:39,007 --> 01:29:42,142
- The savings would be
in the billions!

1262
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:44,745
We can make savings
on prison staff

food and drinks.

1264

On books and television,
housing.

1265
01:29:49,418 --> 01:29:51,952
Heck, we don't even
need fences no more.

1266
01:29:51,954 --> 01:29:53,920
- We can even save more money

1267
01:29:53,922 --> 01:29:56,590
if we attach them in a circle

1268
01:29:56,592 --> 01:29:58,825
like a perpetuum mobile.

Food isn't needed anymore.

1271
01:30:03,599 --> 01:30:08,702
Only cheap liquid
and vitamin injections.

1272
01:30:08,704 --> 01:30:11,037
- And that money
could be spent on schools

1273
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:12,472
and the hospitals

1274
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:14,641
and nursing homes

1275
01:30:14,643 --> 01:30:16,610

Now..

1294
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:26,913
Is that a deterrent?

1295

All what is left

are a few little scars

1302

around his mouth and anus.

1303
01:32:03,418 --> 01:32:06,186
Another big advantage

1304
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:09,356
because other people can see

1305
01:32:09,358 --> 01:32:11,358
by these little stigmas

1306
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,326

in a prison centipede.

1308
01:32:16,098 --> 01:32:19,399

- This..

1316
01:33:01,877 --> 01:33:04,210
This is a violation
of human rights.

1317

it was Mr. But..

- Gentlemen..

1345
01:36:48,670 --> 01:36:52,205
This is exactly
what America needs.

1346
01:36:54,943 --> 01:36:57,644
This may even
get me elected president.

1347
01:36:57,646 --> 01:36:58,678
You've convinced me.

1348
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:01,080
It's genius.

1349

Don't change a goddamn thing.

My pals in DC..

1351
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:11,324
They won't believe
their near-sighted eyeballs.

- You are..

1356
01:37:28,944 --> 01:37:31,911
Absolutely right, Dwight.

1357
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:38,251
You're indeed a genius.

1358
01:37:38,253 --> 01:37:41,387
You came up with the idea.

1359
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:46,159
You deserve every credit.

1360
01:37:47,929 --> 01:37:50,830
Give me a hug, Dwighty!
