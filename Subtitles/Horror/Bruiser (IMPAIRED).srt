1
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,177
Radio host:...million of
you guys out there.

2
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,977
- Host: What's going on?
- Man: Something I wanna do.

3
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,143
- Host: What do you wanna do?
- Man: I wanna kill myself.

4
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:54,770
Well, that doesn't--

5
00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:59,689
- Man: I have a gun.
- Host: Have you loaded it?

6
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:03,730
Host: I'm sorry--
I'm sorry. I just--

7
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:05,882
I just can't take
these things seriously.

8
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:09,666
A lot of you guys phone in,
half the time you guys are cranks.

9
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:10,442
Host: Hello?

10
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:15,027
Host: Well it takes all kinds.
We're gonna take another caller.

11
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:16,750
- Host: You're on line two.
- Man #2: I'm here.

12
00:01:16,713 --> 00:01:17,941
Host: Are you all right?

13
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:20,124
Man #2: Like you give a shit
whether I live or die!

14
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:21,735
Host: I'm a regular guy,
I know what it's like.

15
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,470
Man #2: Regular guy,
my ass!

16
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,369
They don't pay me a million dollars
to sit there and talk to people.

17
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:28,513
Host: Well, they're not paying me
for that either.

18
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,895
They pay me to stir it up,
to try and get some dialogue going.

19
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:34,120
That's why I'm here, I just
wanna get dialogue going with you.

20
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,925
I don't want you
to shoot yourself.

21
00:01:35,884 --> 00:01:38,284
Man #2: My old man drops dead,
that's the point.

22
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,620
Host: I'm sorry,
I didn't know that.

23
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:41,497
Man #2: He leaves
me his house.

24
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:44,479
40 years he's been in this house,
that's all he's got.

25
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:45,695
Host: Yeah, well you lived--

26
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:47,839
Man #2: He leaves it to me,
and what happens?

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,724
Inheritance tax, land tax,

28
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:51,646
school tax,
you're-lucky-to-be-alive tax!

29
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,220
- Man #2: I lost the place.
- Host: You never--

30
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:56,182
Man #2: The bank sold it
out from under me.

31
00:01:56,143 --> 00:01:57,110
Host: Oh man...

32
00:01:57,103 --> 00:01:59,003
Man #2: The guy spends
his life working,

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,292
paying what he owes,
doing what he's supposed to do.

34
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:03,666
Can't leave his house
to his only kid...

35
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,330
what kind of mark
has he made?

36
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:07,224
Host: Listen, chief,

37
00:02:07,217 --> 00:02:09,447
we can all go home and listen
to our own ranting and ravings--

38
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:11,862
Man #2: You shovel
sh--( beep ) all your life,

39
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:13,784
and you don't even leave
a mark?

40
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:15,714
It's like...
you shouldn't bother.

41
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,659
It's like you've
never been here at all!

42
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,740
Host: No man, he left his mark.
He left you.

43
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:23,353
I don't think your old man's
gonna appreciate you kicking off--

44
00:02:23,284 --> 00:02:24,444
- ( gunshot )
- Host: Obviously--

45
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,795
Host: Hello?
Hi... hello?

46
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,138
We got a...
we have a line?

47
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:32,136
66QRZ, we're taking a break.
We'll be right back.

48
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:40,022
Babe?

49
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,216
Janine?

50
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:54,035
God, you're so...

51
00:02:56,889 --> 00:02:58,220
( dog barks )

52
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:08,865
( gasp )

53
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:10,849
Christ!
Is it morning already?

54
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,871
- I'm sorry I woke you.
- Shut the drapes.

55
00:03:19,805 --> 00:03:21,796
( whispering )
Go back to sleep.

56
00:03:21,757 --> 00:03:23,588
I'll be home...
regular time.

57
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:27,921
No, we're supposed to go
to the thing.

58
00:03:27,838 --> 00:03:29,931
- What thing?
- Barbecue.

59
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:30,875
Oh.

60
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,244
Jesus, he's your boss,
Henry.

61
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,805
Did you shut the drapes?
I still feel light on my face.

62
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:38,464
The light.
I got it.

63
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:43,421
Bye.

64
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,758
You know, it's incredible.

65
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:53,656
Some guy just killed himself
on the radio.

66
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:56,393
It takes all kinds.

67
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:59,489
Shit! Now I'm awake!

68
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,857
Wide awake.

69
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:16,199
( dog barks )

70
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:30,857
( barks )

71
00:04:32,935 --> 00:04:36,132
This is people food,
not mouse food.

72
00:04:40,584 --> 00:04:41,573
( saw starting )

73
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:45,559
Janine: She learned
how to do that.

74
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:46,742
Oh, it's cute.

75
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,290
Would you mind
callin' her, please?

76
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:51,717
Janine: All you have to do
is unplug the stupid thing.

77
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:58,540
( saw stops )

78
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:07,407
Janine, do you mind
calling her?

79
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,433
Please.

80
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:12,167
Henry: Janine?

81
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:46,280
Man: ( chuckle )
Why walk when you can fly, baby?

82
00:05:46,195 --> 00:05:49,289
- Jimbo, what is that?
- My new ride. Get in.

83
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:52,764
I tell you, if I could fuck a car,
I'd never leave my garage.

84
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:56,240
- Jimbo: What do you think?
- Oh, she's hot.

85
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,147
She is hot!

86
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,903
- Wanna see what she can do?
- Guess I'm gonna.

87
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:00,166
Oh yeah, you're gonna.

88
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:01,116
Whoa...

89
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:02,576
Come on baby, whoo.

90
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:06,427
Jesus Christ,
could you just slow down?

91
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:09,623
d I've got everything I need...
almost d

92
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:11,756
- d But I don't got you... d
- ( honk )

93
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:14,762
d You're the one I need
the most. d

94
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,740
Always wanted
one of these babies.

95
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:23,130
Cost me a bundle,
but I tell you,

96
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:26,090
some things are just worth it.
Best money I ever spent.

97
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:28,477
- Jimbo: So I dumped Consolidated.
- Henry: Westerman?

98
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:29,876
Uh... sold.

99
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,578
You took a bite on it.

100
00:06:31,545 --> 00:06:34,810
Graves was up 1/8th,
but remember you bought high...

101
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:36,773
against my recommendation.

102
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:38,130
You did all right
on Stimper though.

103
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,335
Cut to the chase.
What am I getting?

104
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:40,619
You already got it,
it's in your account,

105
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,867
- 1 2 and change.
- 1 2?

106
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:45,006
I already told you,
the market's in the toilet.

107
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:46,514
Even so, I figured...

108
00:06:46,492 --> 00:06:49,655
Ah, shit! That's just my luck.
I expected to net--

109
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:52,089
Christ! You make it sound like
I shortchanged you.

110
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:53,997
No, no, it's not that.

111
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,474
I just expected it
to be more.

112
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:58,404
I always expect it
to be more.

113
00:06:58,366 --> 00:07:00,891
Look Jimbo,
I'm house-poor.

114
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,923
I don't even own
the house yet.

115
00:07:02,878 --> 00:07:04,539
I'm stretching the work
to afford it.

116
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,535
You get the report
at the end of the month.

117
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,963
I should pay more attention.
Janine looks after the finances.

118
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,659
I told you
this was a bad idea.

119
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:13,051
Money and friends
just don't mix.

120
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:14,048
Stop it!

121
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,573
Who better to trust than
my oldest and best buddy, huh?

122
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:18,378
Huh?  Come on.

123
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:23,995
Jimbo: 1 2:30, the club.
Call what's-her-name my secretary.

124
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,809
- Betty.
- Right. Work it out with her.

125
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,120
Excuse me.

126
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:29,258
You--

127
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,543
Man: Hey!

128
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:40,395
What the hell
are you doing?

129
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:06,623
Good mornin', Rita.

130
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:09,135
Rita?

131
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:11,787
Rita?

132
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:15,152
Do you ever listen
to the Larry Case show?

133
00:08:15,113 --> 00:08:16,410
No, but Frank told me.

134
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:18,328
Some asshole blew
his brains out.

135
00:08:18,282 --> 00:08:20,113
I tell you,
it takes all kinds.

136
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:25,199
Good morning.

137
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:29,411
Did anyone hear the Larry--

138
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:32,413
- Did you watch Elsa last night?
- The Deevers Collection?

139
00:08:32,332 --> 00:08:34,596
Oh, God. The last creative
thing Rip ever did,

140
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,599
was to get himself
a breast implant.

141
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,616
I have a friend who knows him,
like really well.

142
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:40,564
She says he wanted tits
so he could see

143
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:43,551
how his clothes would
hang on a person with tits.

144
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,698
Oh yeah.

145
00:08:44,686 --> 00:08:46,153
- Coffee?
- Definitely.

146
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,252
Woman: Hey, morning.

147
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:49,111
Rosemary?
What are you doing here?

148
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:52,302
September cover. Milo asked me
to pick out some new faces.

149
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:53,731
- I like this one.
- Yeah?

150
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:56,236
- Which one's your candidate?
- Milo's gonna go with that one.

151
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:59,126
Henry: Number seven.
My lucky number.

152
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,522
- But you haven't even seen her.
- I don't need to.

153
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:03,788
- Your choice is my choice.
- I didn't say she was--

154
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:06,129
Buon giorno, bruisers!

155
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,788
Are you okay?

156
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:10,413
Listen up, guys.

157
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,655
All right...

158
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:14,649
( all clap )

159
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:18,226
- Milo: Bruisers!
- All: Bruisers.

160
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:19,526
Milo: All right!

161
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:23,273
We've been paying close
to $300,000 for a face...

162
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,478
just because it's hot!

163
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,411
Milo: That's insane,
isn't it?

164
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:32,931
Milo: I mean, we're hot,
and we make heat.

165
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,450
So, from now on...

166
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,668
Rosie's got the cover.

167
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:40,455
( cheer and applause )

168
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,276
I'm not actually
gonna be on the cover--

169
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:46,183
Oh, you ought to be, babe!
You'd knock 'em dead!

170
00:09:46,103 --> 00:09:47,900
- ( gasp )
- ( laughs )

171
00:09:48,823 --> 00:09:50,814
Man: You're the number one
photographer.

172
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:53,904
I asked Rosie, "Pick me faces
from the street,

173
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:56,047
that I can own,
and that I can buy...

174
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:58,506
for nothing."

175
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:02,323
Milo: I have never seen
any of these chickies before.

176
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:07,003
But in a minute,
I'll pick September's cover!

177
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:08,673
It's instinct, you know?

178
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,192
You've heard of that?
Impulse?

179
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,732
Those lima beans
hanging between your legs,

180
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:17,291
those are balls!

181
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,013
Maybe you forgot
what they look like?

182
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:21,399
Huh!

183
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,101
- Man: Hello?
- ( laughs )

184
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:27,028
Milo: Now if you find nothing
down there in-between your legs,

185
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,707
stay home.

186
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,070
But if you find
a pair of maracas,

187
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:33,668
get your ass over here
and start shaking!

188
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:35,429
Yeah, get fired.

189
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,518
Show any kind of balls
around here, you get a pink slip.

190
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,904
Let's rock and roll.

191
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:42,465
We've got 1 0 candidates,
one to 1 0.

192
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,799
So who do you pick?
Who do you like?  Come on.

193
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:46,761
- Number seven.
- Who said that?

194
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:49,212
- Henry, sir. It's me.
- Oh, Henry.

195
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:52,782
So we've got one vote
for number seven from Henry.

196
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:54,140
- Come on, who else?
- Number two.

197
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:55,740
- Milo: Number two?
- Man: Number three.

198
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:57,238
- All right?
- Woman: Number ten.

199
00:10:57,218 --> 00:10:58,810
- It's gotta be number ten.
- Man: She's great.

200
00:10:58,786 --> 00:11:00,754
Oh for--
have you seen her teeth?

201
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:01,673
Bad teeth.

202
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,294
No way, no way.

203
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:04,894
No way, no way.

204
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:08,860
Come on, we've seen this face
a hundred times before, haven't we?

205
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,174
This is like
yesterday's pizza.

206
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:12,370
- Cold!
- Woman: '80s.

207
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:15,291
We've got number seven, we've got
number nine. Who do you like now?

208
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:17,298
I'm still going for
number seven, sir.

209
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:19,551
Oh, Henry, stickin' with
number seven!

210
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,017
I have to admire him.

211
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:25,093
Because I admire him,
I can be honest enough to tell him...

212
00:11:24,966 --> 00:11:27,196
your taste is in your ass.

213
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:28,804
( laughs )

214
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:32,898
Number seven is
a fuckin' skunk!

215
00:11:33,768 --> 00:11:35,429
You want her?
Keep her.

216
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,392
Now this is what
I call a bruiser!

217
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:41,764
( groan )

218
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:43,832
You're perfect.

219
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:47,095
Now what
the hell is she, Rosie?

220
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,017
Milo: Chink or Jap?

221
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,478
She's American.
She was born here, Milo.

222
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,935
Her father's from Korea,
her mother's Puerto Rican.

223
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,900
- Dominican.
- She's a spick.

224
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:58,385
Yes sir, she's
half hispanic and part--

225
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,377
Milo: Nip?
She's a spick-nip!

226
00:12:00,331 --> 00:12:01,696
- ( woman laughing )
- Or a pic-nic...

227
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:02,836
I don't care!

228
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:06,594
Can you imagine this face
on a be-like-me cover,

229
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:09,674
among all the white bread
in the fucking supermarket?

230
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,209
Milo: Whooo!
Rosie, great job.

231
00:12:12,141 --> 00:12:15,372
And remember, bruisers,

232
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,405
we make heat.

233
00:12:17,358 --> 00:12:20,885
Man: We make heat, yes!

234
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,115
All: We make heat!
We make heat!

235
00:12:24,015 --> 00:12:26,643
All: We make heat!

236
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:28,601
Milo: Whoooo!
We make heat!

237
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,051
- Milo: And put a spin on it!
- Spin on this.

238
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:32,789
Here, here.

239
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,948
Guess my lucky number's
not so lucky.

240
00:12:34,897 --> 00:12:38,196
I thought he'd pick her for sure.
She's his kind of cheap.

241
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:39,588
You said she was your choice.

242
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,061
I said I thought
she'd be Milo's choice.

243
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,411
I know you picked her
because of me.

244
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:48,092
You're very sweet.
Other guys should take a lesson.

245
00:12:48,979 --> 00:12:51,072
- You know, Milo is--
- The boss!

246
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:52,585
- And bosses are--
- Jerks.

247
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,622
( chuckle )

248
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,056
- I was gonna say entitled.
- Milo's entitled himself.

249
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:59,382
What happened to him?
He was never like that before.

250
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:01,410
No, I know.
He was a communist.

251
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,993
He was a fuckin' refugee,
for Chrissake!

252
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:05,257
Milo's been good to me.

253
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:07,934
He's given me a lot of breaks.
He's given me a career.

254
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:09,625
I can't just forget that.

255
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,781
I want you to know,
I wanna tell you--

256
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:14,217
Milo: Creedlow!

257
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:17,167
- You're one of--
- Milo: Henry, get your ass in here!

258
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,980
Like I said, other guys
should take a lesson.

259
00:13:19,896 --> 00:13:21,386
You're one of the only friends--

260
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,166
- the only true friends--
- Milo: Creedlow!

261
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:25,579
I know.

262
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:27,756
No, you don't know.
You don't understand.

263
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:29,536
What I'm trying to say
is why you and I--

264
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:30,464
Henry?

265
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:34,350
- Asshole wants you.
- ( groan )

266
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:38,573
- Yes, sir?
- What's the fuckin' matter with you?

267
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:40,891
- A problem with your ears?
- No, sir I was just--

268
00:13:40,826 --> 00:13:43,226
We're talking about the party.
Is everything cool?

269
00:13:43,163 --> 00:13:44,255
The barbecue is--

270
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:46,812
Why the fuck should I talk to you
about my own barbecue?

271
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:49,717
- I'm talking about the--
- The masquerade, sir.

272
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,595
You're right, Henry.

273
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,647
That's what we should be
talking about, isn't it?

274
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:55,004
- Yes, sir.
- So, everything's copacetic?

275
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,203
Sir?

276
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:59,386
Come on, entertainment, food,
the laser show, the freak show?

277
00:13:59,294 --> 00:14:01,888
- Everything's under control?
- I think it's gonna be a blast, sir.

278
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:04,620
- Are you coming?
- I'm helping organize everything--

279
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,976
I'm talking about
the fuckin' barbecue, Henry.

280
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:08,538
Yes, sir.
Yes, I'm coming.

281
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:10,911
You know it's one of those
bring-your-wife things?

282
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,747
I'll bring my wife, sir.

283
00:14:12,704 --> 00:14:14,296
Good, Henry!

284
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,963
I love it
when it clicks up there.

285
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:19,294
- Man: Mr. Styles, specifically--
- Milo: Come on.

286
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,820
He's in a staff meeting.
Can I take message?

287
00:14:22,753 --> 00:14:23,720
Who is it?

288
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:26,205
- It's a Mr. Wynn.
- Oh, put him through.

289
00:14:26,146 --> 00:14:28,011
He'll be right with you.

290
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,874
- Good morning, Mr. Wynn.
- Wynn: Good morning.

291
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:33,674
I'm calling about
your application.

292
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:36,694
You were interested
in platinum I believe, not gold?

293
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:38,204
No, I already have
a gold, but uh...

294
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,843
my wife wasn't impressed,
so I wanted to upgrade to a platinum.

295
00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:45,293
Wynn: Yes, well... a platinum card is
like a blank check, Mr. Creedlow.

296
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:48,090
It has no cash limit,
as you know.

297
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:50,940
Your credit history has been
impeccable, but your assets...

298
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:52,822
We found your estimates
were a bit high.

299
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:54,036
High?
By 1 0, 1 5 grand?

300
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:56,547
The market goes up
as well as down. You know that.

301
00:14:56,486 --> 00:14:58,852
- Wynn: We know about the markets.
- Your costume.

302
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,555
But given your limited
equity holdings,

303
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:04,744
we're a good deal further off
than 1 0 or 1 5,000.

304
00:15:06,536 --> 00:15:07,696
That much?

305
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:11,682
Jesus, I must have miscalculated,
but that much?

306
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:14,359
So, my buddy is sitting
at the bar

307
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:17,910
and these two guys come in
carrying a third guy

308
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:20,167
and they just leave him there.

309
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:22,540
The guy just flips off the stool,
and lands flat on his ass.

310
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:24,942
- Out!
- This is the shaggy dog story?

311
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:26,341
No, I swear it's true.

312
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:29,478
So my buddy scoops him up,
puts him back on his stool.

313
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,651
The guy goes... bam!

314
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:35,087
Flips right off the stool
and lands flat on his ass, again.

315
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:37,980
My buddy's looking at him thinking,
"Oh, man he's shitfaced."

316
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:40,096
He goes through his wallet,
gets his license

317
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:42,570
puts him in his car,
drives him home, rings the doorbell,

318
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,001
his wife comes to the door,
he says, "Look, I got your husband."

319
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:46,932
She says,"Thank you very much."
He turns to go,

320
00:15:46,894 --> 00:15:49,556
and she turns to him and says,
"Where's his wheelchair?  "

321
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:51,477
( Larson laughs )

322
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:54,636
"Where's his fucking wheelchair?  "
Come on, Henry. Jesus Christ.

323
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:58,070
Do us all a favor, go out with
some of the money I make you,

324
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:00,163
buy yourself
a fucking sense of humor.

325
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:05,089
Fuck!
40-30.

326
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,772
I got one for you: A guy wakes up
one morning and he's miserable.

327
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:10,591
His life sucks.
He's at the end of his rope.

328
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:13,037
- So, he calls the--
- He calls the Larry Case Show,

329
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:14,843
It's about that guy that
blew his brains out, right?

330
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:16,269
Christ, I can't tell
that story to anyone.

331
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,006
Power of the media.
You should know.

332
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:20,599
I'm not in the media.
I'm in the face business.

333
00:16:21,268 --> 00:16:23,793
- Oh, just out.
- No!

334
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,792
Six inches, man.
Game, set and match.

335
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,767
- You guys are up.
- Great. Thanks.

336
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:31,192
What I want to know is,
why would someone do that?

337
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,786
So what if your life sucks?
Whose doesn't?

338
00:16:33,717 --> 00:16:35,275
No one's, man.

339
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:36,949
Except maybe mine.

340
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,615
They turned me down
on my platinum card.

341
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:41,235
So what?  Who needs it?
Iced tea, please.

342
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,834
- Henry, have something stiffer.
- No, just an iced tea, thanks.

343
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:47,497
They said it's my assets.
That my assets have come up short.

344
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:49,375
It makes you wonder.

345
00:16:49,335 --> 00:16:51,803
No shit it makes you wonder.

346
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:53,795
You don't think there
could be any tampering?

347
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:56,551
- By who?
- I don't know?  Who's got access?

348
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,906
It's not Janine.

349
00:16:57,881 --> 00:17:00,179
It's probably some
computer glitch.

350
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:01,885
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

351
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:03,407
In the meanwhile, Henry,

352
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:06,082
do us all a favor and
don't get worked up, okay?

353
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,911
Like your friend on the radio,
he gets himself all worked up.

354
00:17:08,826 --> 00:17:10,521
Over what?  Nothing.

355
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,288
I guarantee you, if I ever get
cheesed enough to shoot somebody,

356
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:15,180
the last person
I'm gonna shoot is me.

357
00:17:26,973 --> 00:17:28,497
Man: Hey, how's it going?

358
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:32,887
Hey, I just had to do that, man.

359
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,699
You know?
It's a fucking pool party!

360
00:17:35,614 --> 00:17:37,775
No hard feelings, eh?

361
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:40,321
How are you doing, kiddo?

362
00:17:40,255 --> 00:17:43,156
Listen, thank you, Milo,
This is-- this is the best.

363
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:45,063
- Huh?
- Yes. Great.

364
00:17:45,024 --> 00:17:46,355
Great party.
Great house.

365
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:50,238
It's a great house. Great house!
She thinks I'm gonna give it up.

366
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:53,912
Not a fucking inch of it, Rosie.
I'd rather chop an inch off my dick.

367
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:56,763
- You have a good lawyer, I hope?
- The best. Me.

368
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:58,073
- Are you okay?
- Mmm.

369
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,278
Have you filed yet?

370
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:01,427
You don't file until
you have a term sheet.

371
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:03,608
All Rosie has to do is not move out.

372
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:06,615
- She has to live with the creep?
- Not with him, just near him.

373
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:25,441
It doesn't look anything like him.

374
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:27,348
- Sure it does.
- Cheek-bones.

375
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:29,634
- The nose.
- The mouth, maybe the mouth.

376
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,873
Amazing, isn't it?
It's an exact replica,

377
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:35,046
yet you'd never know who he was.
He's a total blank.

378
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:37,147
- Who's blank?
- You are, cutie pie.

379
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:39,189
- Come and take a look.
- That's me?

380
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:40,509
No.

381
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:45,743
That's you.

382
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:51,065
I don't know. I think it's cool.
I can see myself.

383
00:18:50,986 --> 00:18:53,011
Yes, but can you
make other people see you?

384
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,734
- What do you mean?
- Paint it. Color it--

385
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:57,667
whatever you think might
make people recognize that it's you.

386
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:58,910
They're great,
but who are they?

387
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:01,485
The only one I can recognize
is Wilson.

388
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:03,319
- How could you tell?
- The beak.

389
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,971
You ever do one of yourself?

390
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:06,932
- Yeah.
- How'd you decorate it?

391
00:19:06,893 --> 00:19:09,953
No, that's no fun.
I know who I am.

392
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:11,769
Oh. And Milo?

393
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:14,057
It's enough she has
to look at his real face.

394
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:15,430
Gloria, most of the time--

395
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:19,308
I think we all know how
Milo spends most of his time.

396
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:21,947
- And with whom.
- All you have to do is prove it.

397
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,738
- That's you, isn't it?
- Please. Stars and Stripes.

398
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,590
Not until they elect
a female president.

399
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,333
You never told me you were
a sculptress.

400
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:31,687
I'm not.

401
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:33,859
I never had the balls,
as Milo would say,

402
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:35,673
to do anything original.

403
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,534
My little garden of lost souls.

404
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,111
No matter how they're decorated,

405
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:42,675
or what their make-up
or what they're wearing,

406
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,339
as soon as they're gone,
they're gone.

407
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:46,332
They fade from memory completely.

408
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,522
- People are forgettable.
- Most people.

409
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:52,446
Not all people.

410
00:19:52,403 --> 00:19:55,304
Sorry, you have...
a little plaster.

411
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:00,168
We should stop hiding.

412
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,486
People will wonder
where we are.

413
00:20:03,445 --> 00:20:06,710
Yes, I should make
an appearance.

414
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:12,655
You go and see if you can
work on your image.

415
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:14,363
( growls )

416
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,807
The new cover girl you
picked this morning--

417
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,537
Oh, you like this doll, Ted?

418
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:50,763
Tom.

419
00:20:50,748 --> 00:20:53,512
You're afraid I'm gonna pull
her pants down, aren't you?

420
00:20:53,437 --> 00:20:54,768
Uh, no.

421
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:57,479
I mean, yes.
I like her a lot.

422
00:20:57,405 --> 00:20:59,532
But no,
I never thought that you--

423
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:01,147
Sure you did.
Come on.

424
00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:03,712
No. I'm not going to do it.
Not tonight.

425
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:05,911
Tomorrow night,
she's fair game.

426
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:08,415
A month from now, when she's been
all over the newstands,

427
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:10,615
she'll be everybody's date.

428
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,156
Tonight's your only chance to prove
to her that you're the man.

429
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:18,273
Right. Yes.
Well, thank you, Mr. Styles.

430
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,269
I appreciate your advice.

431
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,190
Fucker.

432
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:25,330
You're a total sleaze.

433
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:27,842
What the hell are you?

434
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:39,227
Why do you have to fuck
with people all the time?

435
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:41,198
Because there's nothing else
you can do with them.

436
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:44,785
Look at them.
Fucking pathetic crowd.

437
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:46,304
I don't even know
half of them.

438
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:48,245
The only thing
I need to know,

439
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:50,290
is that they're busy.

440
00:21:50,246 --> 00:21:53,340
And what's keeping
them busy is me,

441
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:55,051
Milo Styles.

442
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:59,212
You're a bastard.
That you are.

443
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,072
Everybody needs a bastard
in their life.

444
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:05,784
You see,
it gives them...

445
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:08,564
a yardstick

446
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,819
to measure themselves by.

447
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:13,518
Your yardstick is out there.

448
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:15,176
Play with it.

449
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:19,104
Come on, you're a grown-up.
Play with it.

450
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:22,149
Don't pop off, okay?

451
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:24,549
I never met a guy who
popped off as fast as you.

452
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:27,585
Old guys lose
their patience quickly.

453
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:29,865
You're not old.

454
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:33,205
Ooh, I caught a brass ring.

455
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,331
Does it mean I get a free ride?

456
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:37,703
Nothing's free, Milo.

457
00:22:37,677 --> 00:22:40,646
This is a pay as you go world.

458
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:41,717
( Milo moans )

459
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:05,041
Ma'am?

460
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,099
Fill it with the best you've got.

461
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:09,185
Switch seats. I'll drive.

462
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,935
- I am not drunk.
- Yes, you are,

463
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:13,758
but that's not what I said.

464
00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:16,080
Say what you think.
Give me a clue, please?

465
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:20,045
Some reason why I should still
be interested in a dick like you.

466
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:22,118
Oh, no reason. Especially when
there's so many more

467
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,898
interesting dicks
under the liquor bar.

468
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,885
You noticed.

469
00:23:25,844 --> 00:23:28,108
Thank God,
you're not brain-dead.

470
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:30,282
- Cash or charge?
- Charge.

471
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:33,426
I try my best, I go out there
every day, and I--

472
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:34,824
Let people walk all over you.

473
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:37,968
Yeah, if that's what
it takes, yes.

474
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:41,279
- There are rules.
- I know the rules better than you.

475
00:23:41,174 --> 00:23:44,041
Man: Sorry, no smoking near
the pumps. Can I check the oil?

476
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,824
The car's fine. Check his oil.

477
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:47,751
No. Just gas, thanks.

478
00:23:47,703 --> 00:23:51,366
You hear about women who
fuck their way to the top.

479
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:53,224
Me...

480
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:55,542
I have been fucking
my way to the bottom.

481
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:59,448
Six years and what do we have
to show for it?

482
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:01,148
A life?

483
00:24:01,114 --> 00:24:03,082
Jesus!

484
00:24:03,034 --> 00:24:06,026
When I first met you I thought
you were on the fast track.

485
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,675
Man, was I wrong.

486
00:24:07,643 --> 00:24:10,840
You swallow your emotions.
You eat whatever shit is served up.

487
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:13,181
- That's not fair.
- You saw me jerking a guy off,

488
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:16,482
for Chrissake!
Did you slug him?  No.

489
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,348
Did you slug me?  No.
( knocking on window )

490
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,063
- Yeah?
- Your credit card, sir.

491
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:23,089
I want to go someplace, Henry.

492
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,701
You are going no place.

493
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,221
You're nothing.

494
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:29,189
Nobody.

495
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:37,179
I'm not going in.
Get out.

496
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,019
Get out of the car.

497
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,443
Treat me like shit.

498
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:51,355
...everything I've got.
What more do you want?

499
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:56,102
Suddenly I'm nothing.

500
00:24:57,186 --> 00:24:58,414
Fuck you!

501
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,862
Aargh!

502
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,314
Janine: Don't wait up.

503
00:25:16,453 --> 00:25:18,318
Did you hear me, asshole?

504
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:20,472
I said, don't wait up.

505
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:21,649
( tires screech )

506
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:13,750
Radio host: We're taking calls
from everybody around the city.

507
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:17,046
And we're gonna take one
from John on line two.

508
00:26:17,934 --> 00:26:19,561
- John: Larry?
- Larry: Yeah. Hi, go ahead.

509
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:22,902
John: I'd like to talk about
the guy that shot himself.

510
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,426
Larry: Yes, what about Mr. Stupid?

511
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:27,368
John: I don't think he's stupid.
I mean--

512
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,576
Larry: Well, I don't know.

513
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,323
John: He made his point.
He made an impression.

514
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,848
Larry: The only thing he made
an impression was on his skull.

515
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:35,844
John: That's a good one. He made
headlines in every newspaper.

516
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,992
Larry: He did it on my show,
and that's what everybody remembers.

517
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,991
John: To get attention. For the first
time in his life, he's been noticed.

518
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,339
Larry: What's good about being
dead and noticed?

519
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:45,339
I mean, dead ain't sexy.
At six feet under,

520
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,563
you think anyone's gonna
notice him in his grave?

521
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:49,372
- John: He's not in a grave.
- Larry: What do you mean?

522
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:52,323
John: He's sitting in a rocking chair,
sipping a cold one,

523
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,040
talking to some pimp
on the radio.

524
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:57,531
I'm him, asshole.
I'm the guy.

525
00:26:57,428 --> 00:27:01,296
Just this regular guy,
my own man and everything,

526
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:03,334
and I'm risen from the dead.

527
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:05,583
And this time around,
I'm not taking any-- ( beep )

528
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:08,017
from rat bastards like you.

529
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:10,448
You treat us like garbage.
Like we're nothing.

530
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,518
Like we're not even here.
You can't turn a man into nothing.

531
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:17,026
You try, you're the one that's
gonna pay. You're the-- ( click )

532
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,319
Henry: This isn't happening.
This is just a dream.

533
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:44,254
Woman: Hello.

534
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,384
Señora, the garage is open.

535
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,049
Is anybody home?

536
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:52,105
Janine's not here, but I am.

537
00:27:56,093 --> 00:28:00,052
You left the garage open.
The door open.

538
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:02,869
This is bad city, señor.

539
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,528
You leave house open
it's trouble.

540
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,470
( woman speaks Spanish )

541
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:11,728
I'm sorry, what was that?

542
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:13,577
( speaks Spanish )

543
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,157
( speaks Spanish )

544
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:41,363
What did you find, Katie?
What did you find in my pocket?

545
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:45,655
Find, señor?  Nothing.
I was fixing your jacket,

546
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:47,807
and fold it out, make it nice.

547
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:50,877
- ( Katie speaks Spanish )
- You stole money, didn't you?

548
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,725
Money?  No, never.

549
00:28:53,638 --> 00:28:56,698
No?  How about silver?

550
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,343
I steal nothing.

551
00:28:58,311 --> 00:28:59,801
( speaks Spanish )

552
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:03,450
( Henry speaks Spanish )

553
00:29:06,728 --> 00:29:10,528
You speak Spanish, señor?

554
00:29:10,408 --> 00:29:12,706
Oh, yeah.
I'm full of surprises.

555
00:29:14,985 --> 00:29:19,149
You must have a lovely home, Katie,
with all the things you've stolen.

556
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:22,613
I steal nothing.
I take nothing.

557
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:24,895
( silver clanks )

558
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:28,436
If you take nothing, then there's
nothing in this bag.

559
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:29,697
Take that!

560
00:29:31,883 --> 00:29:34,374
Henry: It's just that
she made me so angry.

561
00:29:44,846 --> 00:29:47,940
It's real. It's all real.

562
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:56,797
( tires screech )

563
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,374
Janine: Henry?

564
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:11,719
The dog is out.

565
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,268
That's a good dog.

566
00:30:33,173 --> 00:30:34,970
Henry, are you home?

567
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,968
Henry?
The dog was out.

568
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:01,598
Go on now.

569
00:31:06,746 --> 00:31:08,111
Henry...

570
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:34,039
( saw buzzes )

571
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:37,133
( yelps )

572
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,413
Pupsie, come here.

573
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:48,868
I know it's a bad old thing,
bad old saw.

574
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:51,363
I told your daddy to unplug it.

575
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:56,481
He doesn't even know what to do
with an extension cord.

576
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:02,547
Yeah. Hi, it's me.

577
00:32:03,587 --> 00:32:05,578
No, he's not here.

578
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:07,439
- ( Pupsie barks )
- Pupsie, stop that.

579
00:32:07,396 --> 00:32:09,489
I turned it off.
Come here.

580
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:13,313
Come here, baby.

581
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:14,376
That's it.

582
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:16,568
Huh?
He's not here.

583
00:32:16,516 --> 00:32:19,815
If he was, you think I'd tell him
I'm going away with you?

584
00:32:19,717 --> 00:32:23,016
When you're ready to get serious,
then I'll talk to him.

585
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:25,478
Until then, I've got to
make a living, too.

586
00:32:25,414 --> 00:32:27,814
( laughs )

587
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,651
Oh, yeah,
like you give a shit.

588
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,978
So where are you taking me?

589
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,511
Really?

590
00:32:37,737 --> 00:32:40,365
How'd you work that out?

591
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,266
Hold on a minute.

592
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:49,905
Okay.

593
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,488
Come here.

594
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:59,198
Come on. Come on.

595
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,211
A weekend in the sun.
I'll take it.

596
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:04,490
Even if you are
just fucking with me.

597
00:33:06,573 --> 00:33:08,473
Hey, Pupsie.

598
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:11,421
Come on, Pupsie.
Look at this.

599
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:16,155
Look at this.

600
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,814
Come on.
Yeah, good.

601
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,125
Come on.

602
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:51,118
( car engine starts )

603
00:35:16,736 --> 00:35:19,933
- Janine: Milo.
- Milo: I'm hiding.

604
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,216
Milo: Getting warmer.

605
00:35:26,242 --> 00:35:28,506
Getting warmer.

606
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,010
Ooh, you're getting hotter.

607
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:32,141
Ow!

608
00:35:50,054 --> 00:35:53,251
Hey, got to keep up
your energy, honey.

609
00:35:53,157 --> 00:35:56,320
Some English muffin?
Sable on a bagel?

610
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:58,461
I told you, I'm not hungry.

611
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,238
Something more substantial?

612
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,757
( latin music playing )

613
00:36:02,696 --> 00:36:05,824
Are we leaving or what?
This is not my idea of a good time,

614
00:36:05,736 --> 00:36:08,569
standing around watching
you eat sable on a bagel.

615
00:36:08,488 --> 00:36:09,785
Adios.

616
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:16,489
What about some jelly
on the belly?

617
00:36:18,506 --> 00:36:20,838
Oh, God.
Is your dick on steroids?

618
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,269
We spent all last night in bed.

619
00:36:23,211 --> 00:36:25,611
And we're gonna spend
the whole weekend in bed.

620
00:36:27,531 --> 00:36:29,499
Bed...

621
00:36:29,451 --> 00:36:33,410
is a blessing given to us
by the gods.

622
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,657
Come on.

623
00:36:36,813 --> 00:36:41,079
But how often do you get
to make it on a

624
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:46,902
$40,000 fucking
conference table, honey?

625
00:36:58,352 --> 00:36:59,580
Yeah, wait.

626
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:07,265
Milo: I'm gonna come.
Oh God, it's so beautiful.

627
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:10,818
( Janine laughs )

628
00:37:14,834 --> 00:37:18,270
That's good. Give it to me.

629
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:20,358
Give it to me. Give it to me.

630
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:22,537
- Oh, yes!
- ( mechanical door rumbles )

631
00:37:22,484 --> 00:37:24,384
Wait! Wait!

632
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,171
Gotcha, dickhead!

633
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,844
Milo!

634
00:37:29,844 --> 00:37:33,405
Hey, Rosie.
Come on, you're spying on me?

635
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:35,064
That's beneath you, honey.

636
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:37,260
Just trying to keep track
of who's beneath you, Milo.

637
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:39,366
You wanna ruin me?
Is that what you want?

638
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:40,649
I just want what's fair.

639
00:37:40,631 --> 00:37:43,065
- What?
- What's fair, Milo!

640
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:46,894
Shit!

641
00:37:52,952 --> 00:37:54,681
( rattling )

642
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:13,117
- ( clanging )
- Milo.

643
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,055
( crashing )

644
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:21,518
Milo, is that you?

645
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:25,829
( screams )

646
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:28,619
What's the matter?
You shocked by my appearance?

647
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:30,032
- Henry?
- Well, let me tell you,

648
00:38:30,013 --> 00:38:31,640
I'm shocked by yours.

649
00:38:31,614 --> 00:38:34,014
Look at me.
Look at me.

650
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:35,179
Look at me!

651
00:38:41,216 --> 00:38:44,014
You're crazy, Henry.
You've gone fucking crazy.

652
00:38:43,936 --> 00:38:47,337
Not crazy. No, gone.
All gone.

653
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:49,701
You took the only thing
that can't be replaced.

654
00:38:49,633 --> 00:38:51,066
My identity.

655
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:52,531
There's nothing left.

656
00:38:52,513 --> 00:38:54,947
Nothing!

657
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:57,111
Where am I?

658
00:38:57,058 --> 00:38:58,616
Huh?

659
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:04,534
Come on, come out.

660
00:39:07,844 --> 00:39:09,106
Where am I?

661
00:39:12,996 --> 00:39:14,190
Hello.

662
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,579
( screams )

663
00:39:19,749 --> 00:39:20,977
God, is that blood?

664
00:39:20,965 --> 00:39:22,694
Yeah, and you know what?

665
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:24,323
I'm getting a taste for it.

666
00:39:24,294 --> 00:39:25,386
Ow!

667
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,875
Now, I may be a loser,

668
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:34,768
but I know exactly what to do
with an extension cord.

669
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,896
( Janine screams )

670
00:39:37,672 --> 00:39:40,197
You can't do this to me, Rosie.

671
00:39:40,137 --> 00:39:43,595
Rosie, that was a fucking
private moment, you understand?

672
00:39:43,497 --> 00:39:47,160
Don't you have any ethics?
We're partners--

673
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:48,038
( glass shatters )

674
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:50,216
Boo.

675
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:54,097
Don't-- don't hurt me.
Please, Henry.

676
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:55,940
You know me?

677
00:40:55,892 --> 00:41:00,056
I heard you talking.
You and Janine.

678
00:41:01,012 --> 00:41:04,504
Well, that puts you at
an unfair advantage, doesn't it?

679
00:41:04,405 --> 00:41:07,897
You know who I am. So, we'll have
to pull back the curtain

680
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,698
so I can know who you are.

681
00:41:09,654 --> 00:41:11,747
Please, just let me go.

682
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,194
Pull back the curtain.

683
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:17,662
Jesus, Henry.

684
00:41:17,624 --> 00:41:19,558
What's happened to you?

685
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:20,773
What are you doing here?

686
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,854
Nothing. I came to catch up
on some work, that's all.

687
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:27,189
Come out here, Tom.

688
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:30,255
Please, Henry.
You're not going to--

689
00:41:30,169 --> 00:41:32,399
Just come out here, Tom.

690
00:41:32,345 --> 00:41:35,143
I can't fucking check her pulse,

691
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:39,127
she's hanging 20 feet up
with a fucking cord around her neck.

692
00:41:39,003 --> 00:41:42,370
There's no panic,
the cops are on the way.

693
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:48,606
There she is, sir.

694
00:41:48,604 --> 00:41:51,368
I don't know what the hell--
What the fuck is--

695
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:53,453
Sir, she came out from
there, the fourth floor.

696
00:41:53,405 --> 00:41:55,873
Out of fool's mouths.

697
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,137
- What do you mean?
- Janine was right.

698
00:41:58,077 --> 00:42:00,511
I've been eating whatever
shit was served up.

699
00:42:00,446 --> 00:42:02,676
Don't develop a taste for it, Tom.

700
00:42:02,622 --> 00:42:04,783
You'll wind up looking like me.

701
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:14,102
They saw what happened.

702
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,207
Ghandi knows everything
that happened. He saw everything.

703
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,987
And the guy with the saxophone,
he's fucking blind.

704
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:22,135
Just relax, all right?
Just take it easy.

705
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,515
- I'm going to check it out.
- We need an ambulance.

706
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:27,509
I don't know
what's happened to me, Tom.

707
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:33,627
And I'm not sure
I know exactly what to do.

708
00:42:43,652 --> 00:42:46,018
You and I have got
to come to an arrangement.

709
00:42:45,957 --> 00:42:47,822
Tom: Of course.

710
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:51,683
Whatever I--
Anything you--

711
00:42:51,558 --> 00:42:54,026
You don't tell anyone
that you saw me.

712
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,983
I won't.

713
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:59,673
You tell anyone...
anyone that I was here today,

714
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:03,086
and I'll have to take unpleasant
measures, you understand?

715
00:43:02,984 --> 00:43:07,114
Yes. I swear, Henry.
I'll never--

716
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:10,215
Don't disappoint me.
I've been disappointed enough.

717
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:13,852
You have my word, Henry.

718
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:16,395
You have my word.

719
00:43:22,443 --> 00:43:23,671
Mr. Styles?

720
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:27,708
- Yeah, who's asking?
- Detective McCleary, Homicide.

721
00:43:27,627 --> 00:43:29,788
You want to tell us
what happened?

722
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,570
Can't you see
what the fuck happened?

723
00:43:31,532 --> 00:43:33,090
Aside from the obvious.

724
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,400
Why are you looking at me?
I didn't do anything.

725
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,741
I was down here on the street,
and she jumped.

726
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:41,629
The uniformed officers on
the scene don't think she jumped.

727
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,710
What?

728
00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:44,260
They think it was a murder.

729
00:43:46,286 --> 00:43:48,550
Well, you should ask them.

730
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:53,606
They saw everything.
They can tell you what happened.

731
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:55,478
Why don't you go
and talk to them?

732
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,907
I'd rather talk to you.

733
00:43:56,879 --> 00:43:59,245
There's some shit here,
kimosabe.

734
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:04,678
- These things record, right?
- Yeah, sometimes they run a tape.

735
00:44:04,593 --> 00:44:07,790
Hey, boss!
Check this out!

736
00:44:07,697 --> 00:44:08,959
Oh, that was good.

737
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:11,505
See if you can mess up
the crime scene some more.

738
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:13,603
Fuckin' chadrool.

739
00:44:14,962 --> 00:44:17,692
I'm embarrassed
to ask this, sir, but...

740
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:20,679
did you recognize either
one of those garments?

741
00:44:20,595 --> 00:44:23,325
Oh, what do you think, Columbo?

742
00:44:23,251 --> 00:44:25,719
I'm fucking standing here
in my underwear

743
00:44:25,652 --> 00:44:28,120
in the middle of the street
and one of your chadrools

744
00:44:28,052 --> 00:44:31,818
is waving an empty pair
of pants out my window.

745
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:42,094
We were having an affair,
me and that girl.

746
00:44:42,006 --> 00:44:45,134
It doesn't mean I threw her
out the window, you understand?

747
00:44:45,047 --> 00:44:47,072
Was there anybody else
around up there?

748
00:44:47,031 --> 00:44:50,228
Yeah, of course. I always invite
an audience when I fuck.

749
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:51,762
Cheerleaders, crackerjacks...

750
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,634
my wife-- ex-wife.

751
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:57,831
She was here?

752
00:44:57,817 --> 00:44:59,876
What?  As a member
of the audience?

753
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,994
Yeah, very funny.
She's working for me.

754
00:45:01,946 --> 00:45:04,676
She's working for the magazine.
She's a photographer.

755
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:07,696
You saw her leave?
The building?

756
00:45:07,611 --> 00:45:10,739
You mean she was still
in the building?

757
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:13,016
You mean she was hiding?

758
00:45:12,955 --> 00:45:14,855
Oh, come on.

759
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:17,177
No fucking way! No way.

760
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:19,174
My Rosie, she's an angel.

761
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,124
You don't understand.
She's--

762
00:45:22,557 --> 00:45:24,787
No. No, it's impossible.

763
00:45:24,733 --> 00:45:26,997
That's a fucking
horrible thing to say, sir.

764
00:45:34,143 --> 00:45:35,633
( Pupsie barks )

765
00:46:24,326 --> 00:46:25,850
( car approaching )

766
00:46:38,056 --> 00:46:39,921
( doorbell rings )

767
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:44,679
- Man #1 : Call him again.
- Man #2: I've been calling him.

768
00:46:44,617 --> 00:46:46,642
Then you know the number.
Call him again.

769
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:04,075
( phone rings )

770
00:47:05,932 --> 00:47:08,025
( Henry and Janine's voices )
You've reached the Creedlow residence.

771
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:11,075
Leave a message for
either Henry or Janine,

772
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:12,547
Henry: and we'll get back to you.

773
00:47:12,526 --> 00:47:14,221
Janine: Maybe.
( giggles )

774
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:18,857
Henry: We've got to go.

775
00:47:18,799 --> 00:47:21,165
Janine: Come on, we are going.

776
00:47:21,103 --> 00:47:23,571
( Henry and Janine laugh )

777
00:47:23,503 --> 00:47:25,198
( machine beeps )

778
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:27,897
Yeah, this is
Detective Rakowski again.

779
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:29,985
It's about your wife,
Mr. Creedlow.

780
00:47:29,936 --> 00:47:31,870
We've got to talk to you.

781
00:47:31,825 --> 00:47:32,849
( machine beeps )

782
00:47:32,848 --> 00:47:35,749
Man #2: Still no answer, man.
I'm telling you the guy's not there.

783
00:47:35,665 --> 00:47:39,294
- You think we should go in?
- No. No. It's too soon.

784
00:47:39,185 --> 00:47:41,847
Maybe he's lying in there.
Maybe something happened to him.

785
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:43,075
Man #1 : Yeah, maybe.

786
00:47:43,058 --> 00:47:45,549
Man #2: If we make our move,
we should go in.

787
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:48,835
Man #1 : We have no real cause.

788
00:47:48,787 --> 00:47:51,517
If we pop the door,
they're gonna have our asses.

789
00:47:51,444 --> 00:47:54,242
Man #2: No, no. Come on,
maybe he skipped.

790
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:55,722
Man #1 : Why would he skip?

791
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,759
Man #2: Wild guess.
Maybe because he killed his wife.

792
00:47:57,716 --> 00:47:59,081
Man #1 : No, no, no.

793
00:47:59,061 --> 00:48:02,189
He didn't do it.
The other dame did it.

794
00:48:02,101 --> 00:48:04,399
Yeah?
You mean Styles' ex?

795
00:48:04,341 --> 00:48:08,368
What ex?  They're not divorced.
She had motive, she had opportunity.

796
00:48:08,246 --> 00:48:10,305
Styles admitted she was there.

797
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,787
Nah, this dame was
not waxed by another dame.

798
00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:14,489
You know how much strength
it takes

799
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:16,218
to pitch somebody through
a closed window?

800
00:48:16,183 --> 00:48:18,413
That's why the chair.
To break the glass.

801
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,057
This could be the guy.
What about this other guy, Burtram?

802
00:48:21,944 --> 00:48:24,071
I'll bet you 1 00 the dame did it.

803
00:48:24,024 --> 00:48:26,219
- I'll raise you 50.
- You are on.

804
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:28,363
You go dig up
this Burtram character.

805
00:48:28,313 --> 00:48:31,248
I'll go visit Styles
and his ex.

806
00:48:31,162 --> 00:48:33,722
You're not gonna just let
this guy go, are you?  The husband?

807
00:48:33,658 --> 00:48:35,888
No, no, we're not just
gonna let this guy go.

808
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:37,734
You call in for a warrant.

809
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,918
And the dame did it.

810
00:48:38,906 --> 00:48:40,703
No, no.
The dame did not do it.

811
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,922
( beeps )

812
00:48:50,909 --> 00:48:54,538
Man's voice: Henry, I just saw
something on the news, and...

813
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:56,761
it's Jimmy, around 3:00.

814
00:48:56,701 --> 00:49:00,296
Listen, the only thing you can do
wrong right now is freak out.

815
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,589
If Janine is--

816
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:05,559
I can't even say it.
If it's true, there's ownership,

817
00:49:05,438 --> 00:49:07,929
there's joint holdings,
there's all kinds of legal shit.

818
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:10,237
Before you do anything,
call me.

819
00:49:10,176 --> 00:49:11,234
( machine beeps )

820
00:49:11,232 --> 00:49:16,192
Henry. Shit, it's 3:30.
It's Jimmy here, I'm dying.

821
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:17,557
Call me, okay?

822
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,027
Call me.

823
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:56,177
I thought there'd be more.

824
00:49:57,319 --> 00:49:59,844
I always think--

825
00:49:59,783 --> 00:50:01,944
that there ought to be more.

826
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:27,747
( Pupsie barks )

827
00:50:32,556 --> 00:50:35,719
You have been the most annoying
thing in my life.

828
00:51:05,489 --> 00:51:07,286
Reporter: Locally,
police report no suspects

829
00:51:07,249 --> 00:51:09,444
in this morning's murder
of a woman on Newmarket Street.

830
00:51:09,393 --> 00:51:11,520
Traffic was snarled
for several hours

831
00:51:11,474 --> 00:51:14,341
as police closed off the scene,
causing a surge of complaints

832
00:51:14,258 --> 00:51:15,850
from the area's
tony business owners.

833
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:18,488
The victim, whose name is being
withheld pending notification

834
00:51:18,419 --> 00:51:21,286
of next of kin, apparently strangled
to death when she dropped out

835
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:24,230
of a fourth story office window
suspended on a length of cord.

836
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:27,173
The city's bravest joined the city's
finest outside the building...

837
00:51:37,878 --> 00:51:40,278
Henry: Yes, is this
the San Juan Agency?

838
00:51:40,214 --> 00:51:42,978
One of your domestics was supposed
to be with us this morning.

839
00:51:42,902 --> 00:51:47,862
Saldano?  I think her first
name was-- is Katie.

840
00:51:47,703 --> 00:51:49,432
Well, she didn't show up.

841
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:52,954
And I'll let you know
if I hear anything.

842
00:52:17,788 --> 00:52:20,450
What are you saying?

843
00:52:20,381 --> 00:52:22,747
Yeah.

844
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:23,777
Umm-hmm.

845
00:52:23,772 --> 00:52:25,069
( doorbell rings )
No. Hold on.

846
00:52:25,053 --> 00:52:27,613
Inga!

847
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:29,142
Stay on the line.

848
00:52:29,118 --> 00:52:30,881
Can you get the fucking door?

849
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,138
( doorbell rings )
Inga!

850
00:52:36,095 --> 00:52:37,824
Where is she?

851
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:41,649
Inga!

852
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,631
( phone rings )

853
00:52:47,713 --> 00:52:49,237
( phone rings )

854
00:52:49,217 --> 00:52:51,515
Rosie: Whoever it is,
I'm not here.

855
00:52:51,457 --> 00:52:53,357
( doorbell rings )

856
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:56,771
Milo: You're all wet,
so you'll get the phone,

857
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,641
and I'll get the door.

858
00:53:01,986 --> 00:53:05,820
Maybe I'll get wet, get the phone,
and you get the door.

859
00:53:08,259 --> 00:53:10,090
Okay, I'll get the door.

860
00:53:10,052 --> 00:53:12,486
Just answer the fucking phone,
will you?

861
00:53:35,368 --> 00:53:38,701
- Leave me alone.
- Rosemary, don't go to the door.

862
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,500
- What?
- Don't go to the door.

863
00:53:40,456 --> 00:53:42,321
- Milo went to the door.
- Shit! It's the police.

864
00:53:42,281 --> 00:53:44,841
- Who is this?  Henry?
- They think you did it.

865
00:53:44,778 --> 00:53:47,747
- Did what?
- Be careful. Whatever you say.

866
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:50,092
- This is crazy. How did you--
- Don't come out here.

867
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,051
Come out where?

868
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:54,478
- Henry, where are you?
- Outside.

869
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:57,847
You're outside my house?

870
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:15,600
You know how it is, right?

871
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,767
You look like a guy who's been
around the block a few times.

872
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:21,400
With your job,
you must have been out there

873
00:54:21,326 --> 00:54:23,590
salami-ing around
on the side, huh?

874
00:54:23,535 --> 00:54:26,698
No. Of course,
if I had cutie pies

875
00:54:26,608 --> 00:54:28,473
hanging all over me
the way you do--

876
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,696
What are you talking about?
I never touch the chickies.

877
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,835
Word gets out, I'm fried.
The magazine's fried.

878
00:54:32,785 --> 00:54:35,515
The whole shebang
goes Kentucky.

879
00:54:35,441 --> 00:54:38,604
I never touch the chickies.
If I wanna go salami-ing around,

880
00:54:38,513 --> 00:54:42,210
I look for a grown-up.
I think you understand what I mean?

881
00:54:42,098 --> 00:54:44,032
Yeah, well...

882
00:54:43,986 --> 00:54:46,784
I understand what you mean,
"grown-up"...

883
00:54:46,707 --> 00:54:49,107
- Yeah.
-...Iike somebody else's wife.

884
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:50,567
Fuck you, Pope Pius.

885
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:53,880
Like you never stuck your dick
up another man's sandwich?

886
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,578
Come on, give me a break.
We're two guys talking here.

887
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,833
Rosemary, there are only two people
who had a reason to kill Janine.

888
00:54:59,732 --> 00:55:01,063
You and me.

889
00:55:01,044 --> 00:55:02,636
- Henry, it wasn't me.
- Listen to me.

890
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:04,672
Henry, I swear,
I didn't do it.

891
00:55:04,629 --> 00:55:07,097
Listen to what I'm trying to say,
one of us did it.

892
00:55:07,030 --> 00:55:08,395
- No...
- It wasn't you.

893
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:11,138
- It had to be someone else.
- Milo: We got the cops here.

894
00:55:11,062 --> 00:55:12,859
Henry: I did it.
It was me.

895
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:14,449
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

896
00:55:14,423 --> 00:55:16,323
I know this has been tough.

897
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:21,148
Hey, Rosie's tough, right babe?
One tough piece of flesh.

898
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,215
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you mean, "what"?

899
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:27,113
I've got nothing to hide.
I've told them everything already.

900
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:30,230
You caught us in the office,
took some pictures, remember?

901
00:55:30,138 --> 00:55:32,902
All that means
is that I was there.

902
00:55:32,825 --> 00:55:34,258
You were there.

903
00:55:34,234 --> 00:55:37,692
I also told him, didn't I, sir?
I told you specifically,

904
00:55:37,594 --> 00:55:41,360
I told him there's no fucking way
Rosie had anything to do with this.

905
00:55:41,243 --> 00:55:43,370
No, I left.

906
00:55:43,324 --> 00:55:45,986
I told him you fucking left.
Come on, Rosie.

907
00:55:45,915 --> 00:55:47,507
Would you shut the fuck up?

908
00:55:47,484 --> 00:55:49,179
You don't fucking talk to me
like that.

909
00:55:49,148 --> 00:55:52,345
Styles! The lady just asked you
to shut the fuck up!

910
00:55:53,948 --> 00:55:56,576
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, ma'am.

911
00:55:56,509 --> 00:56:01,037
Is there anything you might like
to say without his interference?

912
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:03,624
Rosemary: No. No.

913
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:06,178
- McCleary: These masks...
- They're weird, eh?

914
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,788
- The little lady's hobby.
- Can we go inside, please?

915
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,582
Officer, you want to step inside,
and watch some of her other talents?

916
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:18,584
I'll bet you they're more interesting
than these boring masks.

917
00:56:18,497 --> 00:56:21,933
You never know
what might figure in.

918
00:56:26,914 --> 00:56:29,883
What tape?
What tape are you talking about?

919
00:56:29,794 --> 00:56:31,022
Excuse me.

920
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:36,074
You guys know anything
about a tape?

921
00:56:36,036 --> 00:56:37,060
Oh.

922
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:38,822
The security camera
down at Bruiser.

923
00:56:38,788 --> 00:56:40,722
Some asshole leaked it
to the press.

924
00:56:40,676 --> 00:56:43,474
It's got to be a mask, right?
I mean, obviously.

925
00:56:43,396 --> 00:56:45,421
- Yeah.
- It's Creedlow. The husband.

926
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:46,575
Uhn-uh.

927
00:56:46,565 --> 00:56:48,465
Come on. Anyway,
it's a guy, right?

928
00:56:48,421 --> 00:56:50,719
Give me that.
Obviously, it's a guy.

929
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:52,891
What's so obvious about it?
That could be a dame.

930
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:55,068
That Newley dame,
she makes them.

931
00:56:55,014 --> 00:56:57,642
- Makes what?
- Masks. She's got a million of them.

932
00:56:57,574 --> 00:57:00,475
Yeah, and maybe
she killed Creedlow, too.

933
00:57:00,391 --> 00:57:02,086
Something else
I don't know about?

934
00:57:02,056 --> 00:57:03,819
Well, we executed
the warrant on the house.

935
00:57:03,783 --> 00:57:05,978
The place is a mess.
Blood on the floor,

936
00:57:05,928 --> 00:57:09,261
his I.D. stuck to it.
Nine mil slugs in the walls.

937
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,323
And a shirt with a buttonhole where
there ain't supposed to be one.

938
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:15,202
- What's the word on the blood?
- We're still typing it.

939
00:57:15,113 --> 00:57:18,913
So, Fadush, who's your friend?

940
00:57:18,793 --> 00:57:20,886
She's our only witness.

941
00:57:20,842 --> 00:57:22,707
You interrogate her, huh?

942
00:57:25,514 --> 00:57:27,106
You have the right to an attorney,

943
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:29,415
if you cannot afford an attorney,

944
00:57:29,355 --> 00:57:31,346
Fadush will finance your attorney.

945
00:57:31,308 --> 00:57:33,572
Reporter:...alarmed
by the recent trend

946
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:37,247
and views it as greatly exaggerated
in the local media.

947
00:57:37,133 --> 00:57:41,126
The suspect remains at large,
leading to increased speculation

948
00:57:41,005 --> 00:57:43,633
about the identity
of the mysterious assailant.

949
00:57:43,565 --> 00:57:45,624
Police continue
to refuse to comment

950
00:57:45,582 --> 00:57:47,846
about the motive
for the brutal slaying,

951
00:57:47,791 --> 00:57:51,318
saying only that detectives
view it as an isolated incident.

952
00:57:51,215 --> 00:57:53,046
( reporters ask questions )

953
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:56,306
I don't know what
you're talking about...

954
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:59,005
The murder,
the 56th in the city this year,

955
00:57:58,928 --> 00:58:00,555
has caused renewed attacks

956
00:58:00,529 --> 00:58:02,497
on the administration's
crime policy,

957
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,474
which has resulted
in an increase

958
00:58:04,432 --> 00:58:06,593
in per capita violent incidents,

959
00:58:06,545 --> 00:58:09,878
up 57% from the same period
last year...

960
00:59:05,882 --> 00:59:07,713
All right...

961
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:09,609
that's very cute.

962
00:59:09,562 --> 00:59:10,551
Who's there?

963
00:59:10,555 --> 00:59:12,523
Nobody that matters.

964
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,268
Jesus, come on.

965
00:59:17,436 --> 00:59:19,768
Henry?

966
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:21,608
Are you fucking with me here?

967
00:59:21,564 --> 00:59:23,259
Henry: No no no.

968
00:59:23,229 --> 00:59:26,255
You finish off, I just wanted
to talk about my portfolio.

969
00:59:26,173 --> 00:59:29,074
You know the 1 2 and change that
I thought oughta be more?

970
00:59:30,558 --> 00:59:33,049
Okay, it's better.

971
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:35,941
Better that
it's on the table.

972
00:59:35,902 --> 00:59:38,496
Better that you
finally found out.

973
00:59:38,431 --> 00:59:41,332
Found out?  What could I have
possibly found out?

974
00:59:41,247 --> 00:59:43,875
Uh...

975
00:59:43,808 --> 00:59:47,972
Oh, you mean the money.
The money that you stole from me.

976
00:59:49,857 --> 00:59:52,348
How long have we
known each other, Jimbo?

977
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:55,952
A long time, Henry.
A long, long time.

978
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,777
And do you think it's right
to steal from people

979
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,658
that you've known
for a long, long time?

980
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:05,336
That shiny new car of yours?
I bought it for you, didn't I?

981
01:00:05,251 --> 01:00:07,583
Guys! Anybody?

982
01:00:10,724 --> 01:00:12,692
Walter?

983
01:00:16,261 --> 01:00:18,229
Paul?

984
01:00:20,485 --> 01:00:21,645
Anybody?

985
01:00:21,637 --> 01:00:23,605
( door closes )

986
01:00:25,734 --> 01:00:27,702
Walter?

987
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:42,244
Is anybody...

988
01:00:42,217 --> 01:00:44,185
is anybody in here?

989
01:00:45,097 --> 01:00:47,224
Henry?

990
01:00:47,178 --> 01:00:48,145
Jesus!

991
01:00:48,138 --> 01:00:50,106
Arrgh! God!

992
01:00:52,618 --> 01:00:55,485
I think I broke something.

993
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:57,735
Something's broken.

994
01:00:57,675 --> 01:01:00,405
Thanks.

995
01:01:00,331 --> 01:01:02,822
You signed this, didn't you?

996
01:01:02,764 --> 01:01:05,232
Right where it says
authorizing agent?

997
01:01:09,741 --> 01:01:11,436
What are you, nuts?

998
01:01:11,405 --> 01:01:13,270
Are you fucking crazy?

999
01:01:14,189 --> 01:01:15,156
Arrgh!

1000
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,565
Okay, okay! Fuck, Henry!

1001
01:01:21,487 --> 01:01:23,455
Fuck...

1002
01:01:23,407 --> 01:01:25,068
I did it, all right.

1003
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,339
It was 30 some grand
over two years. That's it.

1004
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,605
That's all I took.

1005
01:01:29,584 --> 01:01:32,417
It was Janine's idea.
She took all the rest.

1006
01:01:32,336 --> 01:01:34,167
I swear to God I'll give you--

1007
01:01:34,129 --> 01:01:37,064
I'll give you
every penny back, Henry.

1008
01:01:39,345 --> 01:01:41,472
My briefcase...

1009
01:01:41,425 --> 01:01:43,393
my briefcase, it's in my locker.

1010
01:01:44,306 --> 01:01:46,866
I'll write you a check
right now.

1011
01:01:47,794 --> 01:01:50,160
Looks like you pissed yourself,
there, buddy.

1012
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:53,091
Must be the stress--
the stress of high finance.

1013
01:01:53,012 --> 01:01:54,980
You fucking prick.

1014
01:01:56,468 --> 01:01:58,436
You're actually enjoying this,
aren't you?

1015
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,205
Henry, your face...

1016
01:02:03,957 --> 01:02:06,755
- you look--
- Different?

1017
01:02:06,678 --> 01:02:09,943
I am, Jimbo.
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

1018
01:02:11,382 --> 01:02:13,612
Argh! God!

1019
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:21,435
Why did you do it?

1020
01:02:21,368 --> 01:02:23,734
I fucked up, Henry.

1021
01:02:23,672 --> 01:02:25,640
I fucked up and I'm sorry.

1022
01:02:25,592 --> 01:02:27,719
Now I'm going
to write you a check,

1023
01:02:28,793 --> 01:02:31,853
and I'm going to make us square.
I'm going to make us even.

1024
01:02:31,769 --> 01:02:33,293
No no no!

1025
01:02:33,273 --> 01:02:35,639
Not nearly even!
Not nearly square!

1026
01:02:35,578 --> 01:02:38,638
Damn it, Henry, you were
never supposed to notice!

1027
01:02:38,555 --> 01:02:39,351
Notice?

1028
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:41,823
You thought because
you didn't notice me,

1029
01:02:41,755 --> 01:02:43,620
that I wouldn't notice you?
Really?

1030
01:02:43,579 --> 01:02:44,546
Yes!

1031
01:02:44,539 --> 01:02:48,031
So if you're going to go
fucking shoot somebody,

1032
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:50,867
shoot yourself, Henry.
Not me!

1033
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:54,375
No, I'm gonna to take
your advice, Jimbo.

1034
01:02:54,269 --> 01:02:57,636
The only bit of decent investment
advice you ever gave me--

1035
01:02:57,533 --> 01:02:59,501
if I ever get cheesed enough
to shoot someone,

1036
01:02:59,453 --> 01:03:01,978
the last person
I'm gonna shoot is me.

1037
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:10,607
Shit...

1038
01:03:17,088 --> 01:03:18,988
You fucking lunatic.

1039
01:03:40,804 --> 01:03:42,863
Some things are worth it.

1040
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,788
Best money I ever spent.

1041
01:03:49,862 --> 01:03:53,389
The man had gone to market
To buy a diamond ring

1042
01:03:53,286 --> 01:03:57,086
The man who never noticed
That he was not a king

1043
01:03:56,966 --> 01:04:01,232
He choose the brightest sparkle
A diamond made of glass

1044
01:04:01,095 --> 01:04:05,930
The setting bright and gold
Was crafted out of brass

1045
01:04:07,464 --> 01:04:11,400
The man spent all his money
The jeweler was a cheat

1046
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:15,461
He told the man that royals
Wore diamonds on their feet

1047
01:04:16,329 --> 01:04:21,232
The man went proudly walking
Inside his shoe, the ring

1048
01:04:22,122 --> 01:04:26,616
And no one ever told him
That he was not a king.

1049
01:04:26,475 --> 01:04:28,340
So you saw the guy,

1050
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:30,392
but you can't describe him.
You want me to write that down?

1051
01:04:30,348 --> 01:04:32,316
Am I a suspect here?

1052
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,726
Fine, if I'm a suspect,
I'd like to consult a lawyer

1053
01:04:35,628 --> 01:04:37,152
before I answer any more--

1054
01:04:37,132 --> 01:04:38,963
Did the I hear the "L" word?

1055
01:04:40,685 --> 01:04:42,277
Relax, Mr. Burtram.

1056
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:45,245
Have yourself a cup of joe.
I brought extra.

1057
01:04:45,165 --> 01:04:48,100
This Nazi shows up at my house.

1058
01:04:48,014 --> 01:04:50,141
I didn't have to come down here
with him, did I?

1059
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,222
No, sir, you did not.

1060
01:04:52,175 --> 01:04:54,143
So why did you?

1061
01:04:59,568 --> 01:05:01,695
Just wait here,
we'll get you a lift home.

1062
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,582
- All right.
- You guys, drive this guy home?

1063
01:05:03,537 --> 01:05:06,597
- Okay.
- It's this car over here.

1064
01:05:09,489 --> 01:05:11,286
Thanks.

1065
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,343
He'll tell you where to go.

1066
01:05:51,096 --> 01:05:53,030
You're still not hard.

1067
01:05:52,984 --> 01:05:54,212
Sorry.

1068
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,168
( garage door opens )

1069
01:05:58,873 --> 01:06:00,932
Girl: What was that?

1070
01:06:00,889 --> 01:06:03,619
Nothing. It's okay.

1071
01:06:04,634 --> 01:06:07,694
Come on, let's try again.

1072
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,577
I'm ready.

1073
01:06:08,571 --> 01:06:11,005
I guess...

1074
01:06:10,939 --> 01:06:12,668
I'm not.

1075
01:06:13,339 --> 01:06:16,866
Girl: You used to say I got you going
more than anyone ever got you going.

1076
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,732
Burtram: You do.

1077
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:22,120
And I had hopes for us,
babe, I really did.

1078
01:06:22,013 --> 01:06:24,914
But I have to get out.

1079
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:27,024
What do you mean?
Out of the tub?

1080
01:06:26,974 --> 01:06:31,070
Out of town.
Out of the rat race.

1081
01:06:30,942 --> 01:06:32,569
Just... out.

1082
01:06:32,542 --> 01:06:34,237
Are you wanted or something?

1083
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:35,606
Are you on the lam?

1084
01:06:35,582 --> 01:06:37,379
The woman who died?

1085
01:06:37,342 --> 01:06:39,469
The police think
I might have killed her.

1086
01:06:39,423 --> 01:06:41,152
I didn't.

1087
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,554
But I know who did.

1088
01:06:43,488 --> 01:06:46,355
Jesus, who?

1089
01:06:46,272 --> 01:06:48,399
Another guy.

1090
01:06:48,353 --> 01:06:51,481
Another... ordinary guy.

1091
01:06:51,393 --> 01:06:53,384
You sold him out
to the cops, right?

1092
01:06:53,345 --> 01:06:55,575
No, I told them
I had no idea who he was.

1093
01:06:56,545 --> 01:06:59,207
Not far from the truth--
I barely know him.

1094
01:06:59,138 --> 01:07:00,571
But in the end,

1095
01:07:00,546 --> 01:07:03,379
he might turn out to be
the best friend I ever had.

1096
01:07:04,131 --> 01:07:05,860
Come on,

1097
01:07:05,827 --> 01:07:08,660
you expect me to pack up
and run away with you

1098
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:10,638
when I'm gonna be
on the cover of Bruiser?

1099
01:07:10,595 --> 01:07:13,120
I didn't ask you
to come with me.

1100
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:14,653
I got the cover, Tommy!

1101
01:07:14,629 --> 01:07:16,654
I didn't ask you
to come with me.

1102
01:07:16,612 --> 01:07:19,547
You expect me to leave town
when I got the cover?

1103
01:07:20,613 --> 01:07:22,581
Hey! Creep!

1104
01:07:23,526 --> 01:07:25,255
You want a free peek?

1105
01:07:25,222 --> 01:07:27,349
Here it is, baby!

1106
01:07:27,303 --> 01:07:30,136
Tomorrow it'll cost you more
than you could ever afford!

1107
01:07:31,015 --> 01:07:32,744
Larry: 66WQRZ.

1108
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:35,680
The 66th caller wins a T-shirt
with a picture of nobody on it.

1109
01:07:35,592 --> 01:07:37,560
Caller, who do you think
Faceless is?

1110
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:39,571
Man: My brother.
He has a problem with authority.

1111
01:07:39,528 --> 01:07:41,223
Larry: So spank him. Next.

1112
01:07:41,193 --> 01:07:42,854
Woman: I think it's you, Larry.

1113
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:45,953
- That's very funny.
- No one ever sees your face.

1114
01:07:45,866 --> 01:07:49,097
You're just a voice
on the radio, anomalous!

1115
01:07:49,001 --> 01:07:51,697
Larry: Anon-- anonamis--
anonymous, you idiot.

1116
01:07:51,627 --> 01:07:53,561
Which is one thing I'm not!

1117
01:07:53,514 --> 01:07:56,312
- This is Frank Himmelfarb.
- Who the hell is Frank Himmelfarb?

1118
01:07:56,235 --> 01:07:57,259
My point exactly.

1119
01:07:57,259 --> 01:07:59,159
Larry: Why don't you
kill yourself?

1120
01:07:59,115 --> 01:08:02,949
This is WKILL.
Phone in and kill yourself.

1121
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:04,318
Himmelfarb!

1122
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:05,790
Frankenfarben.

1123
01:08:05,773 --> 01:08:08,401
We're gonna take a break.
We'll be right back.

1124
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:22,988
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.

1125
01:08:22,927 --> 01:08:25,191
That's a lie--
actually, I did.

1126
01:08:25,135 --> 01:08:28,593
- What are you doing here, Henry?
- I'm going away.

1127
01:08:28,496 --> 01:08:30,225
But first I have
accounts to settle.

1128
01:08:30,192 --> 01:08:32,683
- Milo!
- He's not here.

1129
01:08:32,624 --> 01:08:35,491
I saw him drive away
about an hour ago.

1130
01:08:36,753 --> 01:08:40,712
An hour?  So the accounts you
have to settle are with me.

1131
01:08:40,594 --> 01:08:44,530
I didn't want to wake you,
so I used the time to finish this.

1132
01:08:46,547 --> 01:08:47,946
That's not a cast I made.

1133
01:08:47,922 --> 01:08:50,516
Nope, it's all me.

1134
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:53,402
I've been working on my image.

1135
01:08:54,451 --> 01:08:57,147
For the world's greatest wuss,

1136
01:08:57,076 --> 01:09:00,102
I'm becoming a pretty good
second-story guy.

1137
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,820
I got in the back window.
I had to.

1138
01:09:03,701 --> 01:09:05,635
There's a police car outside.

1139
01:09:18,392 --> 01:09:20,587
I can't let you go out there.

1140
01:09:20,536 --> 01:09:23,471
Henry, I'm sorry.

1141
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:27,508
I'm truly sorry
about what happened.

1142
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:31,319
You sound guilty. What have you
got to feel guilty about?

1143
01:09:31,193 --> 01:09:34,162
Because I was part of it.
I knew.

1144
01:09:34,074 --> 01:09:36,804
You knew?
About Milo and Janine?

1145
01:09:38,139 --> 01:09:39,629
How long?

1146
01:09:39,611 --> 01:09:43,047
Not long, just... Henry, please,
you're scaring me.

1147
01:09:42,939 --> 01:09:46,375
We get so used
to the lies and deceit.

1148
01:09:46,268 --> 01:09:50,762
It makes you do things
that you don't want to do.

1149
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,884
- I tried to tell you.
- I know.

1150
01:09:52,829 --> 01:09:56,560
When you said that it was only the
two of us that could have done it,

1151
01:09:56,446 --> 01:09:58,641
I was so sure you thought
it was me,

1152
01:09:58,589 --> 01:10:01,285
- I couldn't imagine...
- Imagine that it was me?

1153
01:10:01,214 --> 01:10:05,275
That it was Henry?
Henry what's-his-name?

1154
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:06,811
That mouse?

1155
01:10:06,783 --> 01:10:10,514
That mouse-dog crawling around
in an unfinished house?

1156
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:13,197
Trying to make it
look like this?

1157
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:16,715
Who would want to live like this,
except a glutton like Milo?

1158
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:20,170
Why don't you just kick it over?
Get out?

1159
01:10:20,065 --> 01:10:23,091
Get away from him
and all his fucking garbage!

1160
01:10:23,009 --> 01:10:26,001
I am trying.
It's not that simple.

1161
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:27,081
In your head, it's not.

1162
01:10:27,073 --> 01:10:30,839
But out here, where your feet
touch the ground, it is.

1163
01:10:30,722 --> 01:10:33,520
As simple as murder?
What's in your head, Henry?

1164
01:10:34,403 --> 01:10:35,427
Shhh.

1165
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:38,300
It's okay.

1166
01:10:46,437 --> 01:10:50,339
I can understand what you did.

1167
01:10:50,214 --> 01:10:53,945
I can't forgive it,
and I can't forget it.

1168
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:57,527
But I can understand it.

1169
01:10:57,414 --> 01:11:01,976
I know what it's like
to feel so betrayed.

1170
01:11:01,832 --> 01:11:05,893
What you don't understand is that
if you let them betray you,

1171
01:11:05,768 --> 01:11:08,032
you're betraying yourself.

1172
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:09,568
I've done it my whole life.

1173
01:11:09,544 --> 01:11:12,775
And it's what you'll be doing
if you stay with that creep.

1174
01:11:12,681 --> 01:11:14,410
What else do I have?

1175
01:11:14,377 --> 01:11:16,368
Look at me.

1176
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,558
I'll hold.

1177
01:11:17,546 --> 01:11:20,071
- What do you see?
- A beautiful woman.

1178
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:24,030
Someone of value.
Someone I value.

1179
01:11:26,219 --> 01:11:27,743
No, I'm still here.

1180
01:11:27,723 --> 01:11:29,054
We should have spoken.

1181
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,765
We did.
You weren't listening.

1182
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:34,991
At the office.
You said you owed Milo a debt.

1183
01:11:34,892 --> 01:11:36,416
You were saying,

1184
01:11:36,397 --> 01:11:38,888
that if it weren't for that debt,
maybe you and--

1185
01:11:38,828 --> 01:11:40,659
Is that the Larry Case Show?

1186
01:11:41,773 --> 01:11:42,865
Am I on air?

1187
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:47,749
I'm phoning about Faceless.
I know who he is.

1188
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:49,621
Me, Henry Creedlow.
I murdered my wife.

1189
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:51,346
- For God's sake.
- And another woman.

1190
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:53,039
Katie Saldano.

1191
01:11:53,007 --> 01:11:56,306
That wasn't murder...
well, not premeditated.

1192
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:57,436
But I killed her anyway.

1193
01:11:57,424 --> 01:11:59,119
I dropped her body
off the 9th Street pier.

1194
01:11:59,088 --> 01:12:00,385
Henry, stop it!

1195
01:12:00,368 --> 01:12:02,802
And my good friend,
Jimbo Larson.

1196
01:12:02,736 --> 01:12:04,533
He's in the river, same place.

1197
01:12:04,497 --> 01:12:06,658
He'll be the one
in the fancy new car.

1198
01:12:06,609 --> 01:12:08,975
The police are also talking
to a guy named Burtram.

1199
01:12:08,913 --> 01:12:12,076
He had nothing to do with any
of this. He's a good guy.

1200
01:12:11,985 --> 01:12:14,180
And there's another good guy.

1201
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,893
Rosie.

1202
01:12:15,859 --> 01:12:17,520
Rosemary Newley.

1203
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:19,617
She had nothing to do with
any of this, either.

1204
01:12:19,571 --> 01:12:21,368
And she won't have anything
to do with

1205
01:12:21,331 --> 01:12:24,198
whatever happens later tonight.

1206
01:12:24,115 --> 01:12:26,106
I'm cutting you loose, Rosie.

1207
01:13:02,969 --> 01:13:05,733
( people laughing )

1208
01:13:05,658 --> 01:13:07,751
Man: Where the hell
are we going?

1209
01:13:07,707 --> 01:13:09,732
Woman: I don't know.
That's half the fun.

1210
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:11,214
Woman: Milo's idea
of a good time.

1211
01:13:11,195 --> 01:13:13,789
Pack us in a cattle car
and take us down to the ghetto.

1212
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:18,926
Come on down!

1213
01:13:18,844 --> 01:13:20,106
Man: This is the pits.

1214
01:13:20,093 --> 01:13:22,323
Actually, we haven't
gotten to the pits just yet.

1215
01:13:23,709 --> 01:13:27,577
Oh, I believe I found your switch.
Mind if I turn you on?

1216
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:30,388
Miss Jones, you're beautiful
without your glasses.

1217
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:34,238
I wanted contacts, but
they didn't have my size.

1218
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,874
Man: All right,
let's make this quick.

1219
01:13:36,799 --> 01:13:39,666
Y'all got some good shit.
Toss it up.

1220
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,381
- I don't have anything.
- Let's see what this is about.

1221
01:13:42,304 --> 01:13:43,862
You're right.
You ain't got shit.

1222
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,398
Not no more.

1223
01:13:45,376 --> 01:13:46,673
Arrgh!

1224
01:13:47,777 --> 01:13:49,267
Help me.

1225
01:13:55,714 --> 01:13:57,705
Hey! Let's party!

1226
01:14:00,994 --> 01:14:03,963
Why don't we grab a cab
and go home?

1227
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:05,638
May I have your name, sir?

1228
01:14:07,396 --> 01:14:10,388
Mr. Styles likes the names of
those who do not choose to attend.

1229
01:14:15,077 --> 01:14:18,046
Man: I think we could,
maybe, for a few minutes.

1230
01:14:17,957 --> 01:14:19,982
All right.
You guys stay close to me.

1231
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:32,876
Buddy, can you spare
some change?

1232
01:14:32,839 --> 01:14:34,466
It's Henry.

1233
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:36,907
Henry, I hired you, Creedlow.

1234
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,273
Going okay?

1235
01:14:38,248 --> 01:14:39,374
So far, so good.

1236
01:14:39,368 --> 01:14:42,030
Three trucks unloaded,
nobody spotted us as fakes.

1237
01:14:41,961 --> 01:14:42,928
Good.

1238
01:14:53,738 --> 01:14:56,229
I'm the new cover girl.
Are you somebody I should know?

1239
01:14:56,171 --> 01:14:58,332
I don't think so.
I voted for number seven.

1240
01:15:00,075 --> 01:15:01,702
Want to see how
fucking crazy I am?

1241
01:15:01,675 --> 01:15:03,267
We're the wrong dudes.

1242
01:15:03,244 --> 01:15:06,304
Jester: Different strokes
for different folks.

1243
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:08,780
Different rooms for
different dooms.

1244
01:15:14,894 --> 01:15:17,192
Feel the coldness.

1245
01:15:17,134 --> 01:15:20,126
Feel the coldness of dead flesh.

1246
01:15:20,047 --> 01:15:21,844
Feel the coldness.

1247
01:15:27,151 --> 01:15:29,244
( rock music plays )

1248
01:15:33,809 --> 01:15:37,768
d The silence where you hide d

1249
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:40,619
d Till you scream d

1250
01:15:43,058 --> 01:15:45,526
d Till you scream... d

1251
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:56,779
Football player: Touchdown!

1252
01:15:56,756 --> 01:15:57,780
Dancer: Extra point.

1253
01:15:58,644 --> 01:16:00,578
I didn't think it was
gonna be this nuts.

1254
01:16:00,533 --> 01:16:02,933
Call the cannery.
Six cars, signals off.

1255
01:16:02,869 --> 01:16:05,167
If Creedlow is here,
I don't wanna scare him away

1256
01:16:05,109 --> 01:16:06,371
with sirens and shit.

1257
01:16:06,357 --> 01:16:09,690
Two-ninety in a jar.
Strip district, Canal Street.

1258
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,353
Number 1 2,
requesting backup.

1259
01:16:11,318 --> 01:16:13,513
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

1260
01:16:13,463 --> 01:16:15,761
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

1261
01:16:15,703 --> 01:16:18,297
Milo: She's a bruiser!

1262
01:16:18,231 --> 01:16:20,563
Who designed your costume?

1263
01:16:20,504 --> 01:16:21,630
Mommy and Daddy.

1264
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,433
I'm fuckin' freezing, though.

1265
01:16:24,408 --> 01:16:25,932
This is an interesting touch.

1266
01:16:25,912 --> 01:16:27,607
What do you mean,
it's fucking real.

1267
01:16:27,577 --> 01:16:29,408
That fucking thing is real.
I love it.

1268
01:16:29,369 --> 01:16:31,132
It's going to be
a whole new thing.

1269
01:16:31,097 --> 01:16:34,225
It's hotter than silicone,
dames with mustaches.

1270
01:16:34,138 --> 01:16:36,971
Whooo, I'm gonna change
September's cover.

1271
01:16:36,890 --> 01:16:38,687
No! You can't change
your mind.

1272
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:40,584
I told everybody
I got the cover!

1273
01:16:40,539 --> 01:16:41,870
Get out of here, you freak!

1274
01:16:41,851 --> 01:16:44,752
- Milo?  How's it hanging?
- What the heck was that?

1275
01:16:52,796 --> 01:16:54,127
What are you doing here?

1276
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,542
Keeping an eye on things.

1277
01:17:01,054 --> 01:17:02,043
- Chester?
- Yeah?

1278
01:17:02,046 --> 01:17:03,980
Henry Creedlow.
We spoke on the phone.

1279
01:17:03,934 --> 01:17:06,095
Oh, yeah.
How ya' doin', man?

1280
01:17:06,046 --> 01:17:07,274
So what is all this shit?

1281
01:17:07,263 --> 01:17:11,563
Mixers, we got sequencers,
with manual over-rides.

1282
01:17:11,424 --> 01:17:13,654
Of course, of course,
manual override.

1283
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,591
We've got the nub unit
over there.

1284
01:17:15,552 --> 01:17:18,646
That picks up the signals
so we can do the music.

1285
01:17:18,561 --> 01:17:20,927
It's gonna be amazing,
you've gotta see this,

1286
01:17:20,865 --> 01:17:24,096
Iike it's confetti flying and,
shit, it's gonna be great.

1287
01:17:25,122 --> 01:17:27,215
And that thing,
that's a little freaky, though,

1288
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:30,196
because I've never really done
a show before where I had to,

1289
01:17:30,114 --> 01:17:33,379
honest to God, deal with
a blaster like that.

1290
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:35,750
- Cool.
- No. Hot. Don't touch it.

1291
01:17:35,683 --> 01:17:37,776
This fucker is twice as hot
as the fuckin' sun.

1292
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:39,631
Really?
We'd better be careful then.

1293
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:40,987
Very careful.

1294
01:17:40,964 --> 01:17:43,057
Bruiser.
Fuckin' bruiser, man.

1295
01:17:50,438 --> 01:17:52,303
( grunting )

1296
01:18:09,001 --> 01:18:10,764
( snake rattling )

1297
01:18:12,873 --> 01:18:14,500
I think you should
get out of here.

1298
01:18:14,473 --> 01:18:17,067
Henry could walk right by and
you'd never recognize him.

1299
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:19,094
He's painted his face.
Only I've seen it.

1300
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:20,347
Everybody here is faceless.

1301
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:22,355
We don't know what
his real face looks like.

1302
01:18:22,314 --> 01:18:24,839
We're wasting our time looking
for Creedlow. We gotta find Styles.

1303
01:18:24,778 --> 01:18:26,473
Stick with him so nobody
jumps his ass.

1304
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:29,183
Die!

1305
01:18:30,091 --> 01:18:31,922
Die!

1306
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,771
Die!

1307
01:18:37,933 --> 01:18:39,992
Girl: Hey,
where are we going?

1308
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:44,937
Man: All right,
take him up.

1309
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:47,637
Next victim.

1310
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,692
McCleary: Shit! This way.
Come on!

1311
01:18:59,632 --> 01:19:00,894
Son of a bitch!

1312
01:19:08,753 --> 01:19:11,347
Don't shoot!
You might wax the dame.

1313
01:19:12,978 --> 01:19:14,206
We gotta go up.

1314
01:19:14,194 --> 01:19:16,094
No, listen,
he's gotta come down.

1315
01:19:16,051 --> 01:19:18,144
- Where's the goddamn backup?
- I don't know.

1316
01:19:18,099 --> 01:19:20,533
You cover down here,
I'm going up.

1317
01:19:22,195 --> 01:19:23,162
Damn!

1318
01:19:24,596 --> 01:19:26,894
You called them.
You called the police.

1319
01:19:26,836 --> 01:19:28,394
No I didn't.
They followed me here.

1320
01:19:28,372 --> 01:19:30,806
They won't stop me.
You won't stop me.

1321
01:19:30,741 --> 01:19:32,641
Not until I've finalized
your divorce.

1322
01:19:32,597 --> 01:19:34,428
There are other ways
to do this.

1323
01:19:34,389 --> 01:19:36,619
To do what?
You still live with the bastard.

1324
01:19:36,566 --> 01:19:38,727
He probably still gets
to fuck you in the shower

1325
01:19:38,678 --> 01:19:40,509
whenever he's got
the leftover energy.

1326
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:41,437
Am I wrong?

1327
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:43,227
Yes you are!

1328
01:19:43,191 --> 01:19:45,056
Don't do this.

1329
01:19:45,015 --> 01:19:46,414
They know who you are.

1330
01:19:46,391 --> 01:19:48,256
The whole world knows
who you are!

1331
01:19:48,215 --> 01:19:49,182
You told them!

1332
01:19:49,175 --> 01:19:51,666
I told them because I didn't
want them thinking it was you.

1333
01:19:51,608 --> 01:19:53,508
I would have
gotten away with it!

1334
01:19:53,464 --> 01:19:55,455
Gotten away with what?
You didn't do anything.

1335
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:56,645
You don't get it!

1336
01:19:59,033 --> 01:20:00,591
You said you were
gonna leave.

1337
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:02,537
Go now while you
still have the chance.

1338
01:20:03,706 --> 01:20:06,038
I've lost you anyway.
Whatever we had is finished.

1339
01:20:05,978 --> 01:20:07,172
Whatever we had?

1340
01:20:07,162 --> 01:20:09,630
When you told me you killed
all those people,

1341
01:20:09,563 --> 01:20:12,191
I knew there was no chance
of having you as a--

1342
01:20:12,123 --> 01:20:13,385
As a what?

1343
01:20:13,371 --> 01:20:15,202
Friend?  Soulmate?

1344
01:20:15,164 --> 01:20:18,156
Someone to hold your hand,
tell you it's gonna be all right?

1345
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:21,385
You want a companion,
get a fucking dog,

1346
01:20:21,341 --> 01:20:23,241
as long as it's not a poodle.

1347
01:20:29,853 --> 01:20:31,184
This is where we get off.

1348
01:20:32,542 --> 01:20:34,100
Don't worry, it's safe.

1349
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,240
Henry, please,
I'm begging you.

1350
01:20:36,191 --> 01:20:37,681
Really?

1351
01:20:37,663 --> 01:20:39,221
Nobody ever begged me before.

1352
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,167
It feels kind of good
to be begged.

1353
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:42,916
We could leave together,
go now...

1354
01:20:42,879 --> 01:20:44,972
You're only saying that
to save Milo's ass.

1355
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:46,862
Take advantage, Rosemary.

1356
01:20:46,817 --> 01:20:49,513
Do what everyone else does,
and take advantage.

1357
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:50,874
Henry, wait!

1358
01:20:50,849 --> 01:20:52,817
They'll catch you if you go!

1359
01:20:53,793 --> 01:20:56,284
Rosie, they won't know me.

1360
01:20:56,225 --> 01:20:59,353
I'm invisible--
I've always been invisible.

1361
01:21:21,797 --> 01:21:23,765
( elevator doors open )

1362
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,155
( bat screeching )

1363
01:21:41,512 --> 01:21:44,174
Rakowski?  Rakowski?

1364
01:21:44,105 --> 01:21:45,163
I'm right here.

1365
01:21:45,161 --> 01:21:47,129
I think I got him, third floor.

1366
01:21:51,946 --> 01:21:53,914
Stop! Stop or I'll--

1367
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:55,357
( gunshots )

1368
01:21:59,788 --> 01:22:03,246
Henry: Jesus, I could have hit you
if I'd wanted to.

1369
01:22:08,013 --> 01:22:09,981
You son of a bitch.

1370
01:22:21,967 --> 01:22:28,099
d All I give is hate
it seems to them d

1371
01:22:27,887 --> 01:22:32,654
d I thought they could make
things evil... d

1372
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:43,524
Girl: Get lost! I don't get
paid enough for this.

1373
01:22:49,683 --> 01:22:51,275
Any of you guys seen Styles?

1374
01:22:51,251 --> 01:22:52,809
Check the John Does over there.

1375
01:22:52,788 --> 01:22:54,050
Come with me.

1376
01:22:54,036 --> 01:22:56,436
I wanna give him a taste
of his own medicine.

1377
01:22:56,372 --> 01:22:57,430
Okay.

1378
01:22:59,061 --> 01:23:01,188
( girl screaming with pleasure )

1379
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:11,686
What the fuck!

1380
01:23:12,918 --> 01:23:14,886
Are you trying
to scare somebody?

1381
01:23:14,838 --> 01:23:16,066
No.

1382
01:23:16,055 --> 01:23:17,920
I'm just waiting my turn.

1383
01:23:17,879 --> 01:23:19,847
You're my kind of guy,
aren't you?

1384
01:23:21,016 --> 01:23:25,316
That's why I always tell them,
"Bring me a handicapper."

1385
01:23:25,177 --> 01:23:29,307
Because nobody uses it,
it's nice, it's clean, it's tidy,

1386
01:23:29,177 --> 01:23:32,442
and there's plenty of room
to salami around. Know what I mean?

1387
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:34,644
You mean you had
a woman in there?

1388
01:23:36,538 --> 01:23:38,199
Hello?

1389
01:23:38,171 --> 01:23:39,968
What do you think?

1390
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:41,899
That I had a shit of a lifetime?

1391
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:44,911
I have to tell you, Milo,
that in my opinion,

1392
01:23:44,827 --> 01:23:46,954
you're just about the lowest
thing that ever crawled.

1393
01:23:46,908 --> 01:23:49,103
We all mean nothing to you.

1394
01:23:49,052 --> 01:23:51,816
That's right, you mean
nothing to me. You know why?

1395
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:54,368
Because you are fucking nothing.

1396
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:58,896
An ant-- a fucking ant,
with no mind and small balls.

1397
01:23:58,749 --> 01:24:02,583
That's what you all are,
and I'm a fucking anteater--

1398
01:24:03,678 --> 01:24:05,270
- Fuck!
- Milo, relax,

1399
01:24:05,247 --> 01:24:06,646
it's all part of the show.

1400
01:24:06,623 --> 01:24:09,057
Part of the show?

1401
01:24:08,991 --> 01:24:09,958
All right!

1402
01:24:09,951 --> 01:24:12,818
We're fucking with you.
We're just fucking with you,

1403
01:24:12,736 --> 01:24:15,000
- like you fuck with us.
- I like that.

1404
01:24:14,944 --> 01:24:16,502
We've got something planned
for you, sir.

1405
01:24:16,481 --> 01:24:17,709
A grand finale?

1406
01:24:17,697 --> 01:24:20,860
Yeah, I mean how could we have
a grand finale without you, sir?

1407
01:24:20,769 --> 01:24:24,205
- Exactly. Come on!
- Take him away.

1408
01:24:24,098 --> 01:24:27,431
Milo: The grand finale,
that's great!

1409
01:24:29,923 --> 01:24:32,391
Woman: Milo?

1410
01:24:32,323 --> 01:24:34,348
Milo?

1411
01:24:34,307 --> 01:24:37,208
He's gone. Party's over.

1412
01:24:37,123 --> 01:24:38,613
And if you know
what's good for you,

1413
01:24:38,596 --> 01:24:41,759
you'll find yourself a shirt
and get out of here.

1414
01:24:41,668 --> 01:24:43,636
Go on!

1415
01:24:52,966 --> 01:24:55,230
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

1416
01:25:04,903 --> 01:25:06,495
Yeah!

1417
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:18,104
( trumpet blares )

1418
01:25:20,106 --> 01:25:22,597
Got it, hit it--

1419
01:25:25,739 --> 01:25:27,707
What the fuck was that?

1420
01:25:31,243 --> 01:25:33,211
Cool.

1421
01:25:37,804 --> 01:25:40,637
Man: Armageddon,
ladies and gents.

1422
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:42,821
Armageddon!

1423
01:25:42,765 --> 01:25:47,998
I can fly! I can fly!
I can fly! I can fly!

1424
01:25:47,822 --> 01:25:51,280
Where the hell is Tinkerbell?

1425
01:25:51,183 --> 01:25:53,151
Bam!

1426
01:25:53,967 --> 01:25:56,902
So what's happening next?

1427
01:25:56,815 --> 01:25:59,909
This is fucking hilarious!

1428
01:25:59,824 --> 01:26:04,852
I love you,
Romans and countrymen!

1429
01:26:04,688 --> 01:26:06,815
Woman: I love you!

1430
01:26:06,769 --> 01:26:12,298
I love you, too!
Thank you everyone, everybody!

1431
01:26:12,113 --> 01:26:14,081
Aghhh!

1432
01:26:18,099 --> 01:26:19,361
God, get me down!

1433
01:26:19,347 --> 01:26:20,974
Woman: Yeah, Milo!

1434
01:26:20,948 --> 01:26:25,510
This is really happening!
You hear?  This is happening!

1435
01:26:28,244 --> 01:26:30,235
What are you doing?

1436
01:26:30,197 --> 01:26:32,597
- Woman: Dance, Milo, dance!
- Come on, you want to play?

1437
01:26:32,533 --> 01:26:38,563
You little fucking hack!
You're nothing but a hack.

1438
01:26:38,358 --> 01:26:41,418
We... make... heat.

1439
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:51,464
( crowd cheers )

1440
01:27:29,854 --> 01:27:32,186
Henry?  I didn't realize
you were here.

1441
01:27:32,126 --> 01:27:33,957
Henry: You can see my face?

1442
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:35,614
Yeah, Henry,
I can see your face.

1443
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:36,948
My face is back?

1444
01:27:36,927 --> 01:27:39,418
Did it go somewhere?

1445
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:42,157
Yeah... but I stood up.

1446
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:45,374
I stood up for myself!

1447
01:27:45,344 --> 01:27:48,472
Henry, you are a whacko.
But you are such a cute whacko.

1448
01:27:48,384 --> 01:27:49,715
Come here and dance with me.
Come on, come on.

1449
01:27:49,696 --> 01:27:50,663
Freeze!

1450
01:27:50,657 --> 01:27:52,852
( gunshot )

1451
01:27:52,801 --> 01:27:54,769
Masked person:
It's nothing, see?

1452
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:59,810
The mask. My mask.

1453
01:27:59,746 --> 01:28:02,909
It's a total blank.

1454
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:04,184
Just like yours used to be.

1455
01:28:04,163 --> 01:28:06,131
I can't hear you!

1456
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:09,732
McCleary: Freeze!

1457
01:28:09,732 --> 01:28:11,791
Wait a minute, over here.
I'm the killer.

1458
01:28:11,748 --> 01:28:13,682
This isn't right!
It's me you want.

1459
01:28:13,637 --> 01:28:16,538
No, it's me. You thought
it was me all along. It's me!

1460
01:28:16,453 --> 01:28:17,579
It's me!

1461
01:28:17,573 --> 01:28:18,471
- It's me!
- No, it's me!

1462
01:28:18,469 --> 01:28:20,437
- It's me!
- Me!

1463
01:28:37,384 --> 01:28:39,648
Man: This man's dead!

1464
01:28:39,592 --> 01:28:41,617
Dancer: That's it, I quit.

1465
01:28:41,577 --> 01:28:43,807
No, doll, you're fired.

1466
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:09,375
- Are you all right, miss?
- Yeah, yeah.

1467
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:15,646
Sorry to hear about it.

1468
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:18,428
Rakowski: I need everybody,
listen man, all the way downtown,

1469
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:21,080
we're gonna flood
the fucking warehouse district.

1470
01:29:21,006 --> 01:29:23,907
We got a brown Volvo leaving.

1471
01:29:23,823 --> 01:29:25,791
A Volvo!

1472
01:29:26,735 --> 01:29:28,566
He's gone.

1473
01:29:28,528 --> 01:29:30,826
No, he's somewhere.

1474
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:35,219
Somewhere, and I'm going
to find him.

1475
01:29:35,152 --> 01:29:37,120
It's my job to find him.

1476
01:29:38,226 --> 01:29:40,285
Why'd you do it?

1477
01:29:40,242 --> 01:29:42,210
Do what?

1478
01:29:43,986 --> 01:29:46,978
Lady, I've been skunked here tonight,
and I've gotta answer for it.

1479
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:49,834
So help me out--

1480
01:29:49,747 --> 01:29:51,715
why'd you do it?

1481
01:29:53,172 --> 01:29:56,938
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

1482
01:30:04,181 --> 01:30:05,842
Hey.

1483
01:30:05,814 --> 01:30:07,805
If you change your mind--

1484
01:30:07,766 --> 01:30:11,759
if you catch up to him
before I do, gimme a call.

1485
01:30:12,598 --> 01:30:14,498
Okay.

1486
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:15,281
Paula Fleet. That's you.

1487
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:19,846
What are we gonna do
about the Steelers, man?

1488
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:24,250
Here we go.
Here you are, sir.

1489
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:26,589
Apple a day
keeps the doctor away.

1490
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:31,696
Man: Because it's crap,
that's why I don't like it!

1491
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:34,394
Your taste is
up your ass, folks.

1492
01:34:34,435 --> 01:34:37,336
What is it with you?
Does nobody have a fucking brain?

1493
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:39,737
I take it back.
You don't need a brain.

1494
01:34:39,774 --> 01:34:42,038
What you need is some
fucking cojones, folks!

1495
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:44,840
Some lima beans,
for God's sake!

1496
01:34:44,879 --> 01:34:46,779
What the fuck
are you staring at?

1497
01:34:46,814 --> 01:34:47,781
Me, sir?

1498
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:51,979
"Me, sir?  " Yes you, dickhead.
Something here interest you?

1499
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:52,986
Not particularly.

1500
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,988
Then what the fuck
are you staring at?

1501
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:57,388
Nothing, sir. Nothing.

1502
01:34:57,425 --> 01:35:00,292
Get back here--
I'm talking to you, Jack!

1503
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:02,522
I'm talking-- Jesus Christ.

1504
01:35:02,563 --> 01:35:05,031
You people are all assholes,
you know that?  You're dicks.

1505
01:35:05,066 --> 01:35:07,796
I can't even find a fucking
messenger boy around here

1506
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:09,462
who knows what end is up.

1507
01:35:09,503 --> 01:35:12,301
I'm not done with you, asshole!
Get back here!

1508
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:15,475
