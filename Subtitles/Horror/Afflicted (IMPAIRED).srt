<i>Clif and I, six continents,

<i>the pyramids, the Great Wall.</i>

10

It's gonna be epic.

<i>My parents stalled me traveling
when I was really, really young,</i>

<i>and up until the day
that I graduated,</i>

13
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,172
<i>I pretty much spent every
spare moment on the road.</i>

14

And then, I don't know,

great opportunity in I.T.

just do with my life?"

I have known the
aforementioned Derek Lee

24
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,493
since we were both, uh,
pimple-faced teenagers,

Am I nervous? Hell, yes.

Okay? I don't like planes.
I don't like heights.

28

I don't like the Ebola virus.
I don't even like spicy food.

some spectacular footage.

So you guys post suggestions,

I think that Derek's decision to
go on this trip is courageous,

59
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:43,591

who think it's a mistake.

- DEREK: Good.

uh, soon. Very soon.

- Yeah, I...
<i>- She's starting to get a bit concerned</i>

64
00:03:55,402 --> 00:04:00,489
<i>because if something goes wrong on
the road, it's really hard to...</i>

65
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,992
Look, if anything does happen,

66
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,079
there's only really, like,
a 4 percent chance of any...

"He's somebody who has AVM."</i>

<i>DEREK: A few months ago, I started
getting really bad headaches.</i>

73
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:28,851
Um, I went to the doctors.
They took an MRI.

74
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:34,023
<i>And they told me I have something
called an arteriovenous malformation,</i>

75

<i>Or AVM,</i>

76
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,569
<i>which is basically like a tangle
of screwed-up blood vessels</i>

<i>in my brain which if it ruptures,</i>

<i>can cripple or kill me.</i>

REDEKOP: Look, Derek, I'm not gonna
tell you not to go on your trip,

80
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:54,293
but if you develop severe
headaches, weakness in your limbs,

81
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,212
loss of the ability to write,

82
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,881
it could be a sign that
your AVM has ruptured,

83
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:03,803
and it's really important that you
seek medical attention right away.

84
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,348
DEREK:
I have to go, dude, so it's, uh...

85

She's not gonna understand,

86

87
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,312
And she's my mom, so
she's not supposed to.

- I get that. That's cool.
<i>- Whatever, dude.</i>

<i>CLIF:
Given everything he's dealing with,</i>

92
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,117
I think it's pretty incredible
that Derek is going on this trip.

93
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:31,580
Um, he is a normal guy who
got dealt a shitty hand,

94
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,917
and in spite of that, he's
not letting it stop him

<i>from doing the things
that he loves.</i>

96
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,800
I'm going on this trip because
I wanna be there for Derek,

97
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,177
<i>and I'm documenting it</i>

98

101
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,356
I don't wanna look back on my life

102

and wish I had done
something bigger or better.

103

<i>And if I'm gonna see the world,</i>

105
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,785
I kind of have to go right now.

<i>DEREK: Okay, here we go.</i>

107

Clif has entrusted me
with the B cam here

108
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,602
to get some establishing shots.

109
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:35,811
That's really lame,

110
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,607
so instead, you guys get to
see what crazy looks like.

111

- Come. Come see my studio.

113
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,032
DEREK: What are you
doing with all this gear?

114
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:52,453
- Are you ins...? Oh, man.
- This is where the magic begins

115
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,456

dude. What exactly is this?

117
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,588
CLIF: That is a strap-on.

118
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,632
- DEREK: A what? Ha, ha.
- Strap-on.

119
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,343
Basically, I put that on,

120
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,179
this thing clicks in, I can
put the camera right here,

121
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,682
which means I can shoot
multicameras at the same time.

122
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,352
One man, multicamera shoot.

123
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,312
Up to three cameras, in fact.

124
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:21,437
- It is, in fact, amazing.
- DEREK: Ha-ha-ha.

00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,359
Um...

Derek, can you explain to us,
why are we starting here?

131
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,501

So I have to say, we're already
having a hard enough time

148
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,042
because we're naturally less
cool than all Europeans,
