  do this to your guy?

00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,925
       The problem in that room.

223
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:38,136
            You keep him secure.

224
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,507
              Clear.            

225
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,559
            Shit.               

226
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,595
        What?                   
            I don't know.       

227
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,304
              Shit.             

228
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,173
  I think that's my son.        

229
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,179
                        Fuck.   

230
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,549
  He's got my son.              

231
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,654
          What the fuck is that?

232
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,124
          Hey! Hey!             
          What the fuck is that?

233
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,759
  It's your son, Daniel.        
  You remember him, don't you?  

234
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,494
              I know who he is, 
              you piece of shit.

235
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,362
            What is he doing on 
           that fucking monitor?

236
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,464
      Well, I haven't           
      looked at the monitors    
      for some time,            

237
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,166
        so it would be          
        hard for me to say,     

238
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:18,603
        but I would imagine     
        that, um, he's cowering 
        in a corner             

239
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,104
      with a look on his face...

240
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,140
  You motherfucker!             
        No, Eric. Wait.         

241
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,308
        You motherfucker!       
       Where is he? Where is he?

242
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,811
        Where is he?            

243
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,546
      That's a problem you're   
      gonna have to solve       
      before it's too late.     

244
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,449
    He has about two hours      

245
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,751
      before the gas            
      creeping into             
      his nervous system        

246
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,354
    begins to break             
    down his body tissue        

247
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:39,190
      and he begins to bleed    
      from every orifice he has.

248
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:43,594
  Oh, yes. There will be blood. 

249
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,099
          Tell me where he is.  

250
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,601
          He's in a safe place. 

251
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,851
                Eric.           
  I need a phone.               

252
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,419
  Eric, just listen             
  to me for a second.           

253
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,687
        Just give me a phone!   

254
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,494
          Look, everything about
          this fits his profile.

255
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,663
      I need to be sure.

279
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,219
        How do you just         
        wake up in a room       

280
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,887
      and have no idea          
      where you are?            

281
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,789
      I guess you never         
      been drunk before.        

282
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,524
        I've been drunk.        
        I spent three           
        years at college drunk. 

283
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,793
          This isn't drunk.     
          This is kidnapping.   

284
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,969
  Look, I, uh...                
  I saw this movie              
  on TV last week.              

285
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,339
  This guy, he was a reporter,  
  and he goes into              
  this war zone, right?         

286
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,274
  He goes in to                 
  sleep in his hotel room       
  the first night.              

287
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,276
  Bam! He wakes up              
  the next morning,             

288
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,279
  he's in a cell with           
  no windows and no light.      

289
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,982
      And he spent              
      nine years in that room.  

290
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,688
        Nine years?             
        Man, that's nothing.    
        Get over it.

292

      about it and let's        
      do something.

00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:59,957
           If you agree to that,
            then you will       
            see your son again. 

381

  to talk to me alone.

400
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,885

00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,322
  Yeah, I'm fine.               

433
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,407
    I wouldn't do               
    that if I was you.

            Okay. Let's talk.

        Sit down, Eric.

442
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,227
  I want to play a game.        

443
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,029
  The rules are simple.         

444
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,298
  All you have to do is         
  sit here and talk to me,      

445
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,901
    listen to me.

    We haven't been             
    properly introduced.        
    My name's John.             

449
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,011
          I thought you liked   
          to be called Jigsaw.  

450
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,546
          No, no.               

451
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,016
  It was                        
  the police and the press      

452
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:27,885
  who coined                    
  the nickname Jigsaw.          

453
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:30,053
  I never encouraged            
  or claimed that.              

454
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,289
  The jigsaw piece              
  I cut from my subjects        

455
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,925
    was only ever               
    meant to be a symbol        

456
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,261
  that that subject             
  was missing something.        

457
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:41,131
  A vital piece of              
  the human puzzle.             
  The survival instinct.        

458
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:46,136
        This is all really,     
       really interesting, John,

459
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:48,171
              but right now     
             I'd really like for
            you to talk to me...

460
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:50,440
  I am talking to you.          

461
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,342
  You're not listening.         

462
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,611
  Don't forget the rules.       

463
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,146
           I'm listening to you,

464
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,417
            but all I'm hearing 
            is the same sick    
            fucking bullshit    

465
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,653
          that comes about      
          two seconds into every
        interview I've ever done

466
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,488
              with one of you   
              fucking people.   

467
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,557
  Well, that's                  
  an interesting approach       
  to police work, isn't it?     

468
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:11,628
  Aren't you supposed           
  to be convincing me           
  that I'm your friend,         

469
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:16,934
  lulling me into               
  a false sense of security     
  so that I'll confide in you?  

470
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:20,704
    It's a little hard          
    to follow the manual        
   when you've got my son, John.

471
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,173
        The manual?             

472
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:26,076
  What do you                   
  really wanna do to me         
  right now, huh?               

473
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,945
  What would you have done      
  five years ago, huh?          

474
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:30,013
  Would you have                
  followed the manual then?     

475
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:33,317
  Would you have broken my jaw  
  with a flashlight?            

476
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,720
            You seem to know    
           a whole lot about me.

477
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:40,223
  I know you were               
  once considered               
  a fearless police officer.    

478
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:47,297
  Do you feel a whole lot       
  safer now that you only       
  sit behind a desk?            

479
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,499

  That's what you feel.

      Would you                 

483
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:02,112
    kindly get me               
    a glass of water?           

484

              Yeah, well,       
              putting a gun     
              to someone's head 

648
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:02,705
            and forcing them    
            to pull the trigger 
            is still murder.    

649
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:05,008
    Since when is force         
    a problem for you?          

650
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:10,179
  Why are you so desperate      
  to get your son back?         

651
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,651
            'Cause he's my son. 

652
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:17,987
  What's the last               
  thing you said to him         
  before you left him?          

653
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:22,859
                 Well, then, go!

654
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:25,862
  Seems to me that              
  the knowledge of your         
  son's impending death         

655
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:27,697
  is causing you to act.        

656
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:30,233
  Forgive all his sins,         
  to wipe the slate clean...    

657
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:34,370
  Why is it that we're          
  only willing to do that       
  when a life is at stake?      

658
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:36,673
       I've always loved my son.
        That's never changed.   

659
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:39,208
  No, no. It's changed now.     

660
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:43,146
  You see,                      
  the knowledge of death        
  changes everything.           

661
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:47,917
  If I were to tell             
  you the exact date            
  and time of your own death,   

662
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:50,286
  it would shatter              
  your world completely.        

663
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:52,288
          I know.               

664
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,758
    <i> Can you imagine</i>            
    <i> what it feels like</i>         

665
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,360
          <i> to have someone</i>      
          <i> sit you down...</i>

  John Kramer.                  

667
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:01,898
          <i> ...and tell you</i>      
          <i> that you're dying?</i>   

668
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:06,869
        <i> The gravity of that?</i>   

669
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:12,041
          That the clock's      
          ticking for you.      

670
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:18,381
    <i> In a split second,</i>         
    <i> your world is cracked open.</i>

671
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:22,385
  <i> You look at</i>                  
  <i> things differently.</i>          
  <i> You smell things differently.</i>

672
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:26,289
  You savor everything,         
  be it a glass of water        
  or a walk in the park.        

673
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:29,258
    The clock is ticking, John. 

674
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,027
    But most people             
    have the luxury             

675
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:33,646
    of not knowing              
    when that clock's           
    gonna go off,               

676
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,264
  and the irony of it is        
  that that keeps them from     
  really living their life.     

677
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:39,368
  It keeps them sleepwalking.   

678
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,973
  It keeps them                 
  drinking that glass of water, 
  but never really tasting it.  

679
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:46,075
                  You can still 
                 fix this, John.

680
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:49,378
  Yeah, but can we fix you?     

681
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:51,147
                      Me?       

682
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:53,916
    I'm not fixable.            

683
00:45:54,819 --> 00:45:56,285
      I've got cancer.          

684
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,792
            You're using        
            cancer as an excuse 
            for what you do?    

685
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:04,127
              No.               

686
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:10,166
        The cancer isn't        
        what started me         
        in my work.             

687
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,969
      It was the moment I       
      decided to end my life    

688
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:15,171
  that started me in my work    

689
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:17,073
  and brought meaning to it.    

690

  So many people

726
00:48:54,966 --> 00:48:56,933
            So that means       
            we could survive.   

727
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:01,070

  Wait. Amanda,                 
  why did he pick you?          

729
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:06,976
            Because I was       
            a fucking junkie.   

730
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:19,021
        And the funny thing is, 
       I passed his little test.

731
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,260
    If you passed his test,     
    then why are you back here?

          Possession.           

736
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,187
                  But I thought 
                you said that...

737
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:54,056
  Maybe you should talk         
  to the cop who arrested me.   

738
00:49:56,694 --> 00:49:59,462
      I'm guessing              
      you've never been         
      arrested before.

00:59:32,303 --> 00:59:33,869
  There's something             
  I haven't told you, Eric.

    Maybe I can just            
    show it to you.             

880
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:39,907
  But, unfortunately,           
  it's going to be difficult    
  for me to get it myself,      

881
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,044
    so perhaps you              
    could ask the people

  the sort of person you are.   

1198
01:27:40,723 --> 01:27:42,656
      Not long to go now        
    until your son is pissing...

1199
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:45,559
      I'll take you             
      to the house.             

1200
01:27:45,561 --> 01:27:46,960
                Daniel?         

1201
01:27:48,731 --> 01:27:51,598
  There's something             
  I haven't told you, Eric.     

1202
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,968
        <i> It is I who will</i>       
        <i> carry on John's work</i>   
        <i> after he dies.</i>         

1203
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:56,637
              Daniel!           

1204
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:59,740
  So go ahead. Destroy it.      

1205
01:27:59,742 --> 01:28:01,275
              <i> And you...</i>       

1206
01:28:01,277 --> 01:28:02,376
            Daniel!             

1207
01:28:02,378 --> 01:28:05,646
  <i> ...are my first test subject.</i>

1208
01:28:05,648 --> 01:28:07,748
    <i> Now you are locked away,</i>   

1209
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:10,384
        <i> helpless and alone.</i>    

1210
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,555
              You fucking bitch.

1211
01:28:15,557 --> 01:28:17,057
        Game over.              

1212
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:18,959
          I'll fucking kill you!

1213
01:28:19,728 --> 01:28:21,695
          You fucking bitch!    

1214
01:28:22,531 --> 01:28:24,598
            You fucking bitch!  

1215
01:28:26,468 --> 01:28:28,335
        I'll fucking kill you!  

1216
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:30,070
                      No!       

1217
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:36,943
                    No!
