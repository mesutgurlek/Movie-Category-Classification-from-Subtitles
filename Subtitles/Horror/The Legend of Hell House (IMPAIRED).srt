1
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:58,656
Dr. Barrett?

2
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:16,107
My people tell me

3
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:20,271
you're among
the best five in your field.

4
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:22,609
Your fee will be
L1 00,000.

5
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:25,616
Your assignment:
to establish the facts.

6
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:27,049
Regarding what?

7
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,144
Survival after death.

8
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,483
You want--

9
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,615
To know ifit's factual.

10
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,524
What would convinceyou
eitherway?

11
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:37,528
Give me the facts.

12
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:40,429
Where can I fi nd
these facts?

13
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:42,399
In 20 years ofstudy--

14
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:46,267
You'll fi nd them
in the only place

15
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,966
where survival hasn't
yet been refuted.

16
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,804
The Belasco House.

17
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,174
Hell House?

18
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,310
Hell House.

19
00:01:56,381 --> 00:02:00,317
The Belascos sealed it up
afterwhat happened.

20
00:02:00,385 --> 00:02:03,377
20 years ago.
They need money now.

21
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,389
I've bought the place.

22
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:07,425
Can you be there
Monday?

23
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:09,392
Well, can you?

24
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:10,792
Yes.

25
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:12,888
There'll be two others.

26
00:02:12,965 --> 00:02:14,455
Florence Tanner--

27
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,331
Tanner?
But she's a mental medium.

28
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:20,894
Yes. I want that
approach employed, too.

29
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,907
She's practically a child.

30
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:24,909
My people tell me

31
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:28,913
she's the best
in her field, too.

32
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,744
And the other one?

33
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:35,412
The only survivor
from the last attempt.

34
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:37,216
Fischer?

35
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:40,918
I expect an answer
within a week.

36
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:42,119
A week?

37
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:44,822
Take it or leave it.

38
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:01,779
I have a list
ofall phenomena

39
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:04,372
recorded at
the Belasco House,

40
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:06,383
restoration ofelectricity,

41
00:03:06,451 --> 00:03:08,214
transportation of
your equipment.

42
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,879
Is that it?

43
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:12,890
No. There's a partially
constructed machine.

44
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,892
How long before
it's complete?

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,396
Depends on how many
electronics experts you use.

46
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:20,897
How soon
will you need it?

47
00:03:20,966 --> 00:03:22,399
Wednesday.

48
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:23,900
Good day.

49
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:33,911
It would be better
ifyou didn't come.

50
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,415
But I always
come with you.

51
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:41,782
I don't want
to be left alone.

52
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,912
I want to be there

53
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,924
when you prove
your new theory.

54
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:50,519
Isn't itjust another
so-called haunted house?

55
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,928
It's the Mount Everest
ofhaunted houses.

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,936
There were two attempts
to investigate it.

57
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:01,871
Both were disasters.
Eight people died.

58
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,170
Fischerwas
the only survivor.

59
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:07,177
He crawled out
a mental wreck.

60
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,401
These are the house keys.

61
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,404
Your luggage
and equipment

62
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,406
has already
been installed.

63
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,409
Electricity's on.
Your rooms are ready.

64
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,411
There's a full larder.

65
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,414
I'll return
at 5:00 on the 24th.

66
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:04,807
Look at the windows.

67
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:09,812
He had them bricked up
so no one could see in.

68
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,313
Or out.

69
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:35,337
It's hideous.

70
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:39,341
We're not even insideyet,
Miss Tanner.

71
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,900
I don't have to be.

72
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:55,357
[Trying Light Switch]

73
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:57,359
So much for electricity.

74
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:59,361
There's a generator?

75
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:00,396
Yes.

76
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,301
My God, that smell.

77
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,307
The atmosphere in here.

78
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:16,812
Ofthis world,
not the next.

79
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:20,315
This house...

80
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,318
it knows we're here.

81
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:24,320
Miss Tanner.

82
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,821
Sorry.

83
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,824
I'll keep my observations
to myself.

84
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:34,830
Doyou know where
the emergency generator is?

85
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:50,838
I hope
I didn't disturbyou.

86
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:55,851
It'sjust that I'm concerned
foryou coming here.

87
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,012
Yes, I understand.

88
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,051
I wonder ifyou do.

89
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,856
Just how wealthy
was Mr. Belasco?

90
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:37,860
I believe he left millions
when he died.

91
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,866
Died?

92
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:47,335
Ifthere's anything
you'd care to tell us...

93
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:49,872
What's to tell?

94
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,875
The house tried
to kill me.

95
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:55,377
It almost succeeded.

96
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,955
That leads to the cellars,
Mr. Fischer?

97
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,456
That's right.

98
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:15,925
What's through there?

99
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:17,694
The chapel.

100
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,100
Chapel?

101
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,948
Sorry.
I can't right now.

102
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,224
We understand.

103
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,682
Welcome tomyhouse.

104
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,184
I'm delighted
youcouldcome.

105
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:13,689
I'm certainyou will find
yourstaymostilluminating.

106
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,318
Think ofme
asyour unseenhost...

107
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,699
Why couldn't
Miss Tanner come in?

108
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,203
Her system is attuned
to psychic energy.

109
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,262
Obviously,
it's very strong in here.

110
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,334
A church in hell,
that sort ofthing.

111
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:39,347
Why doesn't it
affect him?

112
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,350
Obviously,
he protects himself

113
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:43,613
better than she does.

114
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:52,861
Miss Tanner.

115
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:58,867
Miss Tanner?

116
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,869
I'm sure it's nothing.

117
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,302
Areyou?

118
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:21,274
Miss Tanner?

119
00:12:21,343 --> 00:12:23,277
I'm over here.

120
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:28,547
You shouldn't
have done that,

121
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:30,107
Miss Tanner.

122
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:33,279
You caused us
undue alarm.

123
00:12:33,355 --> 00:12:36,153
I heard a voice in here.

124
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:39,523
Welcome tomyhouse.

125
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,755
I'm delighted
youcouldcome.

126
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,766
I'm certainyou will find
yourstaymostilluminating.

127
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:48,860
Think ofme
asyour unseenhost.

128
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,531
Believe thatduring
yourstayhere,

129
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,540
Ishallbe withyou

130
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:55,200
in spirit.

131
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:58,178
Mayyoufind
theansweryouseek.

132
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,613
Itis here, Ipromiseyou.

133
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:05,141
Andnow,
aufwiedersehen.

134
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:13,160
Aufwiedersehen.

135
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:15,253
''Till we meet again.''

136
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,491
The record wasn't for us.

137
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:22,361
What made
the record go on?

138
00:13:22,437 --> 00:13:26,134
Belasco said
he could will people

139
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:29,644
to a particular object,

140
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:33,841
then move among them
unobserved.

141
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:35,815
I doubt that.

142
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:39,819
Doyou?

143
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:45,826
Our attention was on that
a few moments ago.

144
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:50,593
How doyou know
he didn't walk right by us?

145
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:06,781
This house hasn't lived up
to its reputation so far.

146
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,783
It hasn't taken
our measureyet.

147
00:14:09,851 --> 00:14:13,082
Don't consider the house
the haunting force.

148
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:16,146
Quite evidently,
the problem is created

149
00:14:16,224 --> 00:14:18,658
by multiple
surviving personalities.

150
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:25,165
I take ityou don't believe in
survival, Dr. Barrett.

151
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:27,667
Ifyou mean
surviving personalities,

152
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,169
you're correct.

153
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,171
We will see.

154
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:33,173
Indeed we shall.

155
00:14:33,241 --> 00:14:35,675
When was
the house built?

156
00:14:35,744 --> 00:14:37,678
I don't know.

157
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,179
Mr. Fischer?

158
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,444
1 91 9.

159
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:46,214
You seem to know
a lot about Belasco.

160
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:49,689
Would you mind
sharing it with us?

161
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,693
His fi rst name
was Emeric.

162
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,196
He was born
on March 23, 1 879,

163
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:58,357
the illegitimate son

164
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,867
ofan American
munitions maker.

165
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:03,131
What did he look like?

166
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:05,638
His was
a frightening visage,

167
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:08,141
the face ofa demon

168
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,474
that had taken on
some human aspect.

169
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:14,640
Areyou quoting?

170
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:16,775
Yes, I am.

171
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:19,149
That is his second wife.

172
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,156
She committed suicide
in this room in 1 927.

173
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:27,151
How tall was he?

174
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:29,162
He was 6'5''.

175
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,960
They called him
the Roaring Giant.

176
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,160
What did he do

177
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:38,171
to make this house
so evil, Mr. Fischer?

178
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:41,675
Drug addiction,
alcoholism,

not to mention
a gamut ofsexual goodies.

Shall I go on?

185
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:57,591
How did it end?

186
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:02,221
Ifit had ended,
we would not be here.

187
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:04,993
It's about to end,
Mr. Fischer.

188
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:18,469
What happened
to Mr. Belasco?

189
00:16:20,215 --> 00:16:22,149
No one knows.

190
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:24,651
When relatives
ofthe guests

191
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:28,155
had this house
broken into in 1 929,

192
00:16:28,223 --> 00:16:31,659
they found
all 27 ofthem dead.

193
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,853
Belasco wasn't
among them.

194
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:37,998
Ifno one objects,

195
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:40,159
I'll try a sitting tonight.

196
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:42,169
I have no objection.

197
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:44,671
Would you care to sit

198
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:47,173

Mr. Fischer?

199

and tenderness,

201
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:02,121
we gather here tonight
to communicate with those

202
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,125
who walk this house
in torment.

203
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:07,127
Help us to bridge

204
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:10,130
the chasm ofdeath
so faithfully

205
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:13,133
that pain is transformed
intojoy,

207
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:17,137
All this we ask

208
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:20,641
in the name
ofour Infi nite Father.

209
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,142
Amen.

210
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:52,673
This is an evil house,

00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:55,175
a place ofsickness.

212
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:58,735

Yes.

220
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:31,144
There is a young man.

Why areyou here?

226
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,169
It does no good.

227
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:59,570
Nothing changes.

228
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:02,075
Nothing.

Get out or I'll hurtyou.

230
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,114
I can't help myself.

God damn you,
you fi lthy sons ofbitches.

but I must, I must.

235

Get out ofthis house

[Pounding]

237
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,624
You started manifesting
physical phenomena.

238
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:15,129
But I'm not
a physical medium.

239
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,131
You werejust now.

I don't understand.

All this time
a mental medium,

243
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,586
and now this.

244
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,020
The Lord certainly
does move

in mysterious ways.

246
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,685
So does this house.

247
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,606
Back to normal.

248
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,609
Those pounding noises
are a bit unnerving

249
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,544
the fi rst time
you hear them.

250
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:14,055
Whywas Miss Tanner
so disturbed by that sitting?

251
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:16,455
Because she caused
physical phenomena.

252
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,494
If Miss Tanner
is a mental medium

253
00:21:19,561 --> 00:21:22,496
and Mr. Fischer
a physical medium,

254
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:27,592
how can you be sure she created
those noises, not Fischer?

255
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:32,006
I can't.

256
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:35,510
In fact, I'm not at all sure

257
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:38,512
about Mr. Fischer
or Miss Tanner.

258
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,486
Who is it, please?

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,494
You want
to speak to me?

Areyou the one

261
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:38,172
that warned us
to get out?

262
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:45,012
Yes, it is you, isn't it?

263
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:49,517
You must give me
some sign.

264
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,524
You're not Belasco,
areyou?

265
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:05,465
Such a pain
would not be in Belasco.

Daniel Belasco.

00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:30,490
Very clever.

Ifyou're that clever,

Yes, verywell, thankyou.

a partial answer

He's veryyoung
and frightened.

287
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,982
Because he's
so frightened,

he's very hostile.

289

IfI convince him
to move on,

the haunting force
will be eliminated.

00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:41,421
What is it?

339
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:45,425
A specimen ofthat teleplasm
prepared in water.

340
00:28:48,496 --> 00:28:51,932
What the spiritualists
refer to as ectoplasm

341
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,936
is derived almost entirely
from the medium's body,

342
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:57,938
the remainder
being admixtures

343
00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:00,440
from the air,
the medium's costume,

344
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,373
fi brous remains,
dust particles.

345
00:29:02,444 --> 00:29:05,709
But the bulk is
organic living matter,

346
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:09,910
an organic externalization
ofthought--

347
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:12,919
Mind reduced to matter.

that science dictates?

A cat?

It was possessed
by Daniel Belasco.

your being mauled.

You're being torn

Ofcourse I don't.

it's Daniel Belasco,

you're wrong?

Something unique

He's the one that's
kept me from the chapel.

He made it seem as if
Daniel possessed the cat.

He's the one that's keeping
Daniel's soul imprisoned here.

He's like a general

Never entering the battle,

01:09:31,913 --> 01:09:34,848
sounds, moving objects
like we've experieced.

844
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:37,350
The energy I talk about

845
01:09:37,418 --> 01:09:40,353
is a field of
electromagnetic radiation.

846
01:09:40,421 --> 01:09:41,353
E.M.R.

847
01:09:41,422 --> 01:09:42,514
Exactly.

848
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:45,354
All living organisms
emit this energy.

849
01:09:45,426 --> 01:09:48,862
Such power must saturate
its environment.

850
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:50,864
Is it anywonder

851
01:09:50,932 --> 01:09:54,390
that Hell House
is the way it is?

852
01:09:54,468 --> 01:09:58,302
Consider the mental
and physical energy

853
01:09:58,372 --> 01:10:01,864
which is being poured
into its interior.

854
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:04,878
The house
is a giant battery,

855
01:10:04,946 --> 01:10:06,880
the residual energy
ofwhich

856
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:08,540
must be tapped.

857
01:10:08,616 --> 01:10:12,211
We survive with this energy
after death.

858
01:10:12,286 --> 01:10:13,878
No, Miss Tanner.

859
01:10:13,955 --> 01:10:16,822
This residue
has nothing to do

860
01:10:16,891 --> 01:10:18,825
with surviving
personalities.

861
01:10:18,893 --> 01:10:21,327
The spirit
of Emeric Belasco

862
01:10:21,395 --> 01:10:23,829
does not prowl
this house.

863
01:10:23,898 --> 01:10:25,832
Neither does his son

864
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:28,164
or any other entities

865
01:10:28,236 --> 01:10:32,832
thatyou believeyourself
to be in contact with.

866
01:10:32,907 --> 01:10:34,841
There is one thing

867
01:10:34,909 --> 01:10:38,345
and one thing only
in this house--

868
01:10:38,412 --> 01:10:40,346
mindless,
directionless power.

869
01:10:40,414 --> 01:10:42,348
You're wrong, Dr. Barrett.

870
01:10:42,416 --> 01:10:44,850
You cannot
destroy a spirit.

871
01:10:44,919 --> 01:10:49,788
All you will do is send it
to another hell.

872
01:10:49,857 --> 01:10:51,848
No, Miss Tanner.

873
01:10:51,926 --> 01:10:53,860
I'm right.

874
01:10:53,928 --> 01:10:56,863
My machine
will fi ll the house

875
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:58,865
with a massive
countercharge

877
01:11:00,868 --> 01:11:03,837
opposing the polarity
ofthe atmosphere,

878
01:11:03,904 --> 01:11:05,838
reversing,
and dissipating it.

879
01:11:07,441 --> 01:11:10,376
And Hell House
will be exorcised.

880
01:11:15,950 --> 01:11:17,474
I see.

881
01:11:17,551 --> 01:11:21,385
Well, there's nothing else
to do then.

883
01:11:34,402 --> 01:11:35,494
Ah!

884
01:11:49,684 --> 01:11:53,848
Thank God she didn't
know what to smash.

885

I should be flattered.

Her attack
on the reverser

887

was her ultimate tribute.

888

She knows I'm right.

889
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:05,365
There was
nothing else to do.

890
01:12:05,433 --> 01:12:07,367
That's what she said.

891
01:12:07,435 --> 01:12:10,370
She had to destroy
my beliefs

892
01:12:10,438 --> 01:12:12,429
before they
destroyed hers.

893

Oh, yes, yes, yes.

Whateveryou do,
do not interfere.

1019

01:26:32,846 --> 01:26:35,280
Here I am.

01:26:35,349 --> 01:26:38,216
Destroy me ifyou can.

Kill me!

That's it.

Oh, that's it.

1028
01:27:14,888 --> 01:27:18,756
Tell me something,
Belasco.

1029
01:27:20,828 --> 01:27:24,264
Why didn'tyou ever
leave this house

1030
01:27:24,331 --> 01:27:26,265
when you were alive?

1031
01:27:27,835 --> 01:27:31,771
Why did you despise
the sunlight?

1032
01:27:33,841 --> 01:27:38,278
Was it better hiding
in the shadows?

No one...

1035
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:47,287
No one could really
seeyou then,

1036
01:27:47,354 --> 01:27:49,788
could they?

1037
01:27:49,857 --> 01:27:52,291
No one could fi nd out

1038
01:27:52,359 --> 01:27:55,294
your secret then,
could they?

1039
01:27:57,865 --> 01:28:01,301
You weren't a genius!

1040
01:28:01,368 --> 01:28:05,304
You were a deviate!

1041
01:28:05,372 --> 01:28:09,706
A sawed-off
little bastard!

Your motherwas a bitch!

1044
01:28:21,388 --> 01:28:24,323
A whore!

1045
01:28:24,391 --> 01:28:26,951
You were a bastard!

1046
01:28:31,899 --> 01:28:36,836
A funny little
dried-up bastard!

1047
01:28:36,904 --> 01:28:40,840
You're no genius!

1048
01:28:40,908 --> 01:28:44,639
You're no Roaring Giant!

1049
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:53,853
What size wereyou,
Belasco?

1050
01:28:53,921 --> 01:28:56,856
5-foot 2?

1051
01:28:56,924 --> 01:28:59,859
1 ?

1052
01:28:59,927 --> 01:29:06,355
I knowyou weren't even
5-foot tall.

1053
01:29:06,433 --> 01:29:10,870
Aah!

Emeric Belasco.

1055
01:29:26,386 --> 01:29:29,822
The Roaring Giant.

1056
01:29:38,899 --> 01:29:40,992
Is it clear?

1057
01:30:41,094 --> 01:30:43,927
This is a special moment.

1058
01:30:43,997 --> 01:30:48,161
Meet Emeric Belasco.

1059
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:51,864
Your husband did have
part ofthe answer.

1060
01:30:51,939 --> 01:30:55,875
Florence had
part ofit, too.

1061
01:30:55,943 --> 01:30:59,379
I fi nally found
the last part,

1062
01:30:59,446 --> 01:31:02,381
that which
Belasco's giant ego

1063
01:31:02,449 --> 01:31:04,679
could not face.

1064
01:31:16,463 --> 01:31:19,330
He so despised
his own shortness

1065
01:31:19,399 --> 01:31:22,334
that he cut off his legs

1066
01:31:22,402 --> 01:31:26,338
and wore those instead
to give himselfheight.

1067
01:31:26,406 --> 01:31:30,342
''Ifthine eye offend thee,
pluck it out.''

1068
01:31:39,419 --> 01:31:42,855
Maybe he was a genius
after all.

1069
01:31:42,923 --> 01:31:46,359
Just because a man
preserves his body

1070
01:31:46,426 --> 01:31:48,860
doesn't make him
a genius.

1071
01:31:48,929 --> 01:31:53,366
It's not his body
ofwhich I'm speaking.

1072
01:31:53,433 --> 01:31:56,368
This is why
your husband's machine

1073
01:31:56,436 --> 01:31:59,371
could not destroy
his power.

1074
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:05,378
These walls
are sheathed with lead.

1075
01:32:05,445 --> 01:32:08,380
He built himself
a fortress

1076
01:32:08,448 --> 01:32:11,383
to protect his spirit.

1077
01:32:11,451 --> 01:32:15,888
He knew what was coming
years before it came.

1078
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,834
Your husband
and Florence

1079
01:32:28,902 --> 01:32:31,837
helped us
to rid this house

1080
01:32:31,905 --> 01:32:33,338
of Belasco.

1081
01:32:33,407 --> 01:32:36,342
Let us hope
that their spirits

1082
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:39,846
guide him
to everlasting peace.

1083
01:32:45,919 --> 01:32:49,704
Belasco.
