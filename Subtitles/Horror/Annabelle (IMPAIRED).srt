before she got caught up in the cult.

Looks a lot different than the last time

For what, specifically?

663
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:56,195
I don't know, there must have been
some motive for their attacks.

- Crazy people do crazy things.
- Crazy things. I know.

665

They didn't think they were crazy.

666
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,834
They had to have had a reason.

667
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:12,841
After a little more digging, I did
find that their act wasn't devotional.

668
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:17,429
That they were actually
trying to conjure something up.

669

And one more thing.
Does the cult have a name?

687
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:41,349
They called themselves
“The Disciples of the Ram."

688

Oh, no, no, no.

691
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,039
I just learned something.

692

I'm too tired to show it.

698
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,359
Now, you gonna tell me?

699
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:37,523
- Or we just...
- I think my family's being haunted by a ghost.

So you believe in this stuff?

705
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:03,549
Let's just say that I've had one
or two experiences in my life...

706
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:07,390
...that have helped me
to keep an open mind.

707
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:19,906

experiencing is the ghost of that girl.

Why not?

709
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,445
Well, ghosts haunt specific places.

710
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:27,455
Usually where something terrible
has happened.

But we moved and it's still happening.

trying to summon something.

From what I've read in the past...

...these cults,
they don't summon ghosts.

718

And they won't stop until they get one.

is in one of these books.
