00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,180
All right.

160
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,980
Hi.

161
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,260
Hi.

162
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,780
- How you been?
- Okay.

163
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,860
- You?
- Peachy.

164
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,860
Actually, to tell you the truth,
I've been kinda out of it.

165
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,780
I know. It took me
ten years to find you.

166
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,500
That is sick.

167
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,700
What are you doing
with this jerk anyway?

168
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,700
Ten years is
a long time, Chucky.

169
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,620
Besides, I was never
actually with him.

170
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,540
You know me.

171
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,020
I'll kill anybody,
but I'll only sleep with someone I love.

172
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,340
- You look great, Tiff.
- Thanks.

173
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,340
I mean it.
I gotta be honest.

174
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,660
I always thought
you were gonna let yourself go.

175
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,180
Come here.

176
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,940
Yeah.

177
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,860
Huh?

178
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,220
Stop it.

179
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,580
- Hmm.

180
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,020
All right,
you satisfied?

181
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,980
- Can I wait in the car, please?
- No.

182

[ Siren Chirps ]

183
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,180
All right,
Boogie Nights, you're up.

184
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,420
This is such
a load of shit.

185
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,580
You know we haven't
been drinking.

186
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,300
Well, then, you've got
nothing to worry about, do you?

187
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,100
Evening, Chief.

188
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,100
Seems like
a false alarm here.

189
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,500
That's okay, Norton.
Better safe than sorry, right?

190
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,700
- This is a new low.
- For you too.

191
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,540
- Get in the car.
- Bite me.

192
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,780
Jade, when you're 18,
you can go to hell for all I care.

193
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,060
But until then,
I'm stuck with you.

194
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,380
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let you embarrass me...

195
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,420
by ending up on Jerry Springer
with some trailer trash lowlife.

196
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,980
- You fuck.
- But you won't.

197
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,420
Not Jade anyway.
Not any more.

198
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,380
In the car.

199
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,860
You can't keep us
from seeing each other.

200
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,260
I'm the Chief of Police, sport.
I can do whatever I want.

201
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,540
So if, for example, I was
to run a blood test on you tonight...

202
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,380
and the results made you look like
Christian Slater on New Year's Eve,

203
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,940
you think anybody
would question me?

204
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,100
- He's bluffing.
- Try me.

205
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,060
I wish we really could
choose our own families.

206
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,980
David, you keep
your orchid dry now, you hear?

207
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,100
- Come on, sunshine.

208
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,060
"Try me."

209
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,860
Screw him.

210
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,380
If I were you, I would take Jade,
get the hell outta Dodge...

211
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,500
and never look back.

212
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,740
Look, Chucky.

213
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,380
I made Swedish meatballs,
your favorite.

214
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,820
Honey, you shouldn't have.

215
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:02,460
Well, I wanted everything tonight
to be absolutely perfect.

216
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,780
Tiff, what the hell
is that?

217
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,460
It's a playpen, silly,
for the nursery.

218
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,460
You know, Chucky,
I still have the ring.

219
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,260
- What ring?
- The ring, the one you left for me.

220
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,540
I found it on the mantel the night you
were killed. I've never taken it off.

221
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,900
Oh, that? The one I got
from Vivian Van Pelt.

222
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,020
- Vivian who?
- Vivian Van Pelt.

223
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,980
I dumped her
in the river, remember?

224
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,780
That ring is worth
five or six grand, easy.

225
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,140
You mean... you weren't
gonna ask me to marry you?

226
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,860
What are you, fucking nuts?

227
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,620
You thought...

228
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,500
You haven't changed.

229
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,780
You'll never change.

230
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,060
What the hell
was I thinking?

231
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,220
Now, the first thing we gotta do is
get me outta this body once and for all.

232
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,220
No.

233
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,140
I think I prefer you
like this.

234
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,140
You're kinda cute.
You're just like a little baby.

235
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,340
- Is the little baby ticklish? Is he?
- Stop!

236
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,860
- Is he? Is he? Is he?
- Stop! Stop!

237
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,820
- Is he? Is he? Okay. Mommy's tired.

238
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,220
Time to go to sleep.

239
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,100
Okay, I get it.

240
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,980
You're still hung up
on the domestic thing.

241
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,740
No problem.
We'll get hitched.

242
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,820
Sorry.
I'm not into short guys.

243
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,260
My mother always said
love was supposed to set you free.

244
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,940
But that's not true, Chucky.

245
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,180
I've been a prisoner of my love for you
for a very long time.

246
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,780
Now it's payback time.

247
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,660

Wow. You are strong.
Nice muscle tone. You work out a lot?

That is,

- Treat her right, Jesse.
- Excuse me?

299
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,020
Treat her right.
Never take her for granted.

300
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,660
It's like my mother
always used to say,

301
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,380
"A woman spends all day
slaving over a hot stove for a man,

302

the least he can do
is the dishes."

303

She's kind of a philosopher,
my mother.

00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:51,140
- Hmm. Take it easy.
- See you around.

307
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,140
That is incorrect.
The correct spelling of "woman" is...

308
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,900
W-O-M-A-N.

309
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,940

- Yoo-hoo! I'm home.

Oh! Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

312
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,540
If you can't play nice,
I may just have to take your toys away.

313
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:27,140
I have a surprise for you. I've been
thinking about what you said...
