we think it's important.

471
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,842
Well, um...

472
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,675
I've been researching
the original case,

473
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,926
and going through
the court transcripts.

474
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,883
Do you know who
Benjamin Sewell is?

475
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,266
He was a car thief, arrested
in 1946 in Texarkana

476
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,096
for possession of
a stolen automobile.

477
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,603
A lot of people think that he
was the Phantom because...

478
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,523
Well, the killing stopped
once he was arrested.

479
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,068
How long was he in for?

480
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,942
Thirty years.
JAMI: Thirty years.

481
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,116
And then Benjamin Sewell
died, Ms. Lerner.

482
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,034
Yes, sir.
He died last summer.

483
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,611
In a hospital in Fort Worth.

484
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,288
I spoke to a nurse
that worked at the hospital,

485
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,956
um, since before
Benjamin died...

486
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,454
Now, come on, we don't
have time for this.

487
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,786
Hold on. She said a young
man used to visit him.

488
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,416
His son, they thought.

489
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,123
What if it's him?

490
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:20,879
That the passing of his
father set him off

491
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,176
and he came back here
to finish his father's work?

492
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,927
Benjamin Sewell did
have a son, Ms. Lerner,

493
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,055
but he died in a bar
fight two years ago.

494

00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:09,449

Nothin'.
It was based on nothin'.

868
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:28,380
But Hank McCreedy's
pregnant wife,

869
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,306
she demands an autopsy.

870
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,635
And then it come out.
He wasn't run over.

871
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:35,312
He was stabbed
more than two dozen times,

872
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:36,684
right next to the tracks.

873
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,477
My daddy, he had
a theory about that.

874
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,315
He said that the Phantom
killed McCreedy,

875
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:49,197
you know, his last victim,
his final goodbye.

876
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:53,660
And then he hopped
a train to California.

877
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:56,834
Mr. Pierce, I've read everything
there is to read on this.

878
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,831
I've never even heard
of this Hank McCreedy.

879
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,332
It should have been
front-page news.

880
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:04,167
But while the Arkansas
police were findin' McCreedy,

881
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,844
the Texas police,
they were arresting Sewell

882
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,671
and so you got
two different camps

883
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,035
each saying
they got the Phantom.

884
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,346
And what neither of them
is piecing together is that

885
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:16,349
Sewell was in custody
when McCreedy was killed,

886
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:18,101
proving that neither
one was the Phantom.

887
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,975
So Sewell was in jail,

888
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,107
and then, did anything
ever come from McCreedy?

889
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,688
Oh, he's dead.

890
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,782
Yep, and dead men
don't complain much.

891
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,700
But his pregnant wife, Mary,

892
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:31,868
she's pissed as shit.

893
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,195

894
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:36,031
My daddy tracked
her down in 1974.

895
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,367
And, oh, she was still bitter.

896
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,544
She said that Texarkana

897
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,667
had done worse than
killed her husband.

898
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:44,544
It had shat on his memory.

899
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,172
And in the process, it was
shitting on her life.

900
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,877
It was shitting on
her son's life.

thing to his son!

Only because

1107
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,495
everybody in this town

1108
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:22,414
just wants to believe
this whole thing is over.

1109
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:26,918
(FOSTER GROANING)

1110
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:42,676
It is over.

1111
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:12,882
<i>JAN“: This story
is about Texarkana.</i>

1112
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:15,301
<i>A town that is
really two towns.</i>

1113
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:17,378
<i>Two sheriffs. Two mayors.</i>

1114
01:19:17,461 --> 01:19:19,589
<i>And in the end, two Phantoms.</i>

1115
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:23,384
<i>After I came out of the
Redwater Bayous that night,</i>

1116
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:26,061
<i>Ranger Morales
and his men went back in.</i>

1117
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:29,640
<i>They wanted to close the most terrible
chapter in our town's history.</i>

1118
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,691
<i>Some people say the swamp
took Deputy Foster,</i>

1119
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:38,070
<i>that the swamp gave him
the only burial he deserved.</i>

1120
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,741
<i>Others believed I hadn't
killed the Phantom</i>

1121
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:42,036
<i>'cause he was something
that couldn't be killed.</i>

1122
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,205
<i>A demon or a spirit.</i>

1123
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,328
<i>People believe what
they need to believe.</i>

1124
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:49,251
<i>They make up whatever story they
need to keep living sanely.</i>

1125
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:50,703
<i>CHARLES JR. ON</i> TV:
<i>Well, I did the Bootleggers,</i>

1126
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:52,038
and The Legend of Boggy Creek

1127
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,919
<i>and this is my third one,
Wkﬂerhawk.</i>

1128
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:56,717
<i>JAN“: The hardest thing for my town
has been the wrestling to understand</i>

1129
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,045
<i>how Clayborn Foster
and Corey found each other</i>

1130
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,505
<i>and put on those masks</i>

1131
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:04,262
<i>and did those inhuman things.</i>

1132
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:07,561
<i>Their lives were investigated and
there was nothing linking them.</i>

1133
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:11,391
<i>They had nothing in common except
the darkness in their souls.</i>

1134
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,693
<i>And I swear, that will keep the Phantom
alive as much as anything else.</i>

1135
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:17,605
<i>As for me,</i>

1136
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:19,690
<i>I did what my grandma
always wanted.</i>

1137
01:20:20,858 --> 01:20:24,158
<i>I left Texas.
I moved</i> away.

1138
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:27,448
<i>To a new life,</i>

1139
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:30,375
<i>to a place where no one knows
who I am, or what I survived.</i>

1140
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:33,185
<i>Where I'm the only
person that knows</i>

1141
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:35,080
<i>that as quickly
and as senselessly</i>

1142
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:38,293
<i>as death came to
Texarkana in 1946,</i>

1143
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,548
<i>and then again late last year,</i>

1144
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:42,971
<i>it could come back</i>

1145
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,345
<i>the next time
the sun goes down.</i>
