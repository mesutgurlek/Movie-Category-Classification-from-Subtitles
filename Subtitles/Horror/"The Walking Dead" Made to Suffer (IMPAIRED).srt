00:14:16,196 --> 00:14:17,997
Please.

168
00:14:17,998 --> 00:14:20,199
This isn't about you trying
to repopulate the Earth.

169
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,700
I didn't mean no offense.

170
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:23,970
I've been locked up
a long while

171
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:25,504
and, well,
there weren't many women.

172
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:27,139
You following me?

173
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,908
I mean, Maggie, she's with
Glenn and you're a lesbian.

174
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:31,910
I was just talking with her.

175
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:33,478
I'm not a lesbian.

176
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:37,182
You got the...
short hair.

177
00:14:39,285 --> 00:14:41,486
You're not a lesbian?

178
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:46,123
My, my,

179
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:48,125
this is interesting.

180
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:51,228
No, it's not.

181
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:56,333
( yells )

182
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:23,425
Let him go!

183
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:30,765
Okay.

184
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:35,136
Give me the gun!

185
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:36,504
Get up!

186
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:55,755
<i>( Merle speaking, indistinct )</i>

187
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:58,324
Glad we could catch up.

188
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,062
Just keep looking at me.

189
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:05,098
I love you.

190
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,103
Man: <i>On your feet, move.
Let's go, come on.</i>

191
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,604
Shit.

192
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,780
<i>( explosion ) ( all shouting )</i>

193
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:33,423
( coughing )

194
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,396
Shots came from up there.

195
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:41,232
- I'm gonna check it out.
- No, I'll handle it.

196
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,233
Sometimes biters get in
through the side fence.

197
00:16:43,234 --> 00:16:44,734
There's no need
for anyone to panic.

198
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,770
Woman:
Someone help!

199
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:48,772
What happened?

200
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:52,942
Guys came through with guns.

201
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:55,145
- Governor: <i>How many?</i>
<i>- I-- I don't know.</i>

202
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:58,581
- Well, think. - Six or seven guys.
I've never seen them before.

203
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,816
Girl: <i>Are we under attack?
What should we do? ( crowd clamoring )</i>

204
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:02,317
Hey, hey, hey.

205
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:04,987
Everyone, please just go
home, lock your doors, huh?

206
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:07,089
We need to keep
everyone safe, okay?

207
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,024
So just get inside,
keep your lights off.

208
00:17:09,025 --> 00:17:11,026
Come on.

209
00:17:11,027 --> 00:17:12,895
( crowd murmuring )

210
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,529
We're under attack.

211
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,398
You fan out and you
find these people.

212
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,400
Don't take any chances,
try and take prisoners.

213
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,869
You shoot to kill, huh?
Come on.

214
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:32,112
Rick:
Inside, quick!

215
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:43,056
- Daryl: Ain't no way out back here.
- Rick, how did you find us?

216
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:45,158
- How bad are you hurt?
- I'll be all right.

217
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,659
Where's that woman?

218
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,195
She was right behind us.

219
00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:53,933
Daryl: Maybe she was spotted.
Want me to go look for her?

220
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,335
No. We gotta get them
out of here.

221
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:58,204
She's on her own.

222
00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:01,874
Daryl, this was Merle.

223
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,843
<i>It was.</i>
<i>He did this.</i>

224
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:08,179
- Rick: <i>You saw him?</i>
<i>- Face to face.</i>

225
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,415
Threw a walker at me.
He was gonna execute us.

226
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,952
S-So my brother's
this governor?

227
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:15,887
No, it's somebody else.

228
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,621
Your brother's his
lieutenant or something.

229
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:19,189
Does he know
I'm still with you?

230
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,225
He does now.
Rick, I'm sorry.

231
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,759
We told him wherthe prison was.

232
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,196
- We couldn't hold out.
- Don't. No need to apologize.

233
00:18:27,698 --> 00:18:30,133
Maggie: They're gonna
be looking for us.

234
00:18:30,134 --> 00:18:32,635
We have to get back.
Can you walk?

235
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:34,471
We got a car a few miles out.

236
00:18:34,472 --> 00:18:36,172
- I'm good.
- All right.

237
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:38,407
Daryl: Hey, if Merle's
around, I need to see him.

238
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,042
Not now.
We're in hostile territory.

239
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:42,311
- He's my brother. I ain't--
- Look at what he did!

240
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:44,480
Look, we gotta-- we gotta
get out of here now.

241
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:46,448
Maybe I can talk to him.
Maybe I can work something out.

242
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:48,951
No, no, no.
You're not thinking straight.

243
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:51,019
Look, no matter what
they say, they're hurt.

244
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,988
Glenn can barely walk.

245
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:54,856
How are we gonna make it out

246
00:18:54,857 --> 00:18:56,091
if we get overrun by walkers

247
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:57,592
and this governor
catches up to us?

248
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:59,861
I need you.

249
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:02,797
Are you with me?

250
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:04,565
Yeah.

251
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:08,068
<i>( door opens )</i>

252
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:09,603
- Any sign of them?
- Signs of what?

253
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:11,438
What exactly
is happening out there?

254
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:13,707
Some assholes want
what we have.

255
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,176
- Then what are we doing waiting
around here? - Damn straight.

256
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:17,744
Let's take these
sons of bitches out.

257
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:19,613
How do we know that the
perimeter was breached?

258
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:21,215
Did anyone actually see them?

259
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:23,116
- They killed Warren.
- Killed?

260
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:27,020
<i>Got up close, stuck a stake</i>
<i>through his neck.</i>

261
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,587
We need patrols now.

262
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,290
Can't take chances
with these terrorists.

263
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,992
You check on our people,
make sure they're safe.

264
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,527
You want me to do house calls,

265
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:35,962
make sure everyone's tucked in?

266
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:38,731
These guys could be holed up
in one of our residences.

267
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,865
They could be holding
someone captive or worse.

268
00:19:40,866 --> 00:19:42,167
Can't anyone else handle that?

269
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,269
I've got a hell of a lot
of experience and--

270
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,770
Thank you.

271
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:47,605
The rest of you split up.

272
00:19:47,606 --> 00:19:49,408
Merle will lead the search.

273
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,478
Don't you think Haley should
handle the door-to-doors?

274
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:55,446
I need someone with some authority
to provide reassurance.

275
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:57,114
I mean, she's just a kid.

276
00:19:57,115 --> 00:19:59,516
These people have already
killed one man, beaten another.

277
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:02,386
- I'm good with a gun--
- Just do as I ask.

278
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,589
Sure.

279
00:20:57,572 --> 00:21:00,140
On three.
Stay tight.

280
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:01,475
One, two, three.

281
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:12,419
Let's go!

282
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,000

Go! Get cover!

286

Get there.

Go, go, go!

288
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:02,299
- You all right?
- I saw them.

289
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:07,036
- How many?
- Oscar: <i>I didn't see.</i>

290
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:08,704
Don't matter.
There's gonna be more of them.

291
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:11,274
We need to move.
<i>( gunfire continues )</i>

292
00:22:13,009 --> 00:22:15,678
One of them, at least.
Black guy, young.

293
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,614
Looked like he was wearing
a prison jumpsuit.

294
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:20,615
Escaped convicts.

295
00:22:20,616 --> 00:22:22,617
- Any grenades left?
- Uh-huh.

296
00:22:22,618 --> 00:22:25,320
Get 'em ready.
We gotta gun into the wall.

297
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:33,027
We gotta get off the street.

298
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:34,762
We're not soldiers,
we're survivors.

299
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:36,263
We'll wait them out.

300
00:22:36,264 --> 00:22:38,566
- Once the smoke clears--
- Nah, they could be anywhere.

301
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,735
- You get off the street.
- Where are you going?

302
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:43,637
- Off the street. Come on, move!
- Oh shit.

303
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:45,839
You guys go ahead.
I'm gonna lay down some cover fire.

304
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,442
- No, we gotta stay together.
- Too hairy. I'll be right behind you.

305
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:53,614
Ready?

306
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:01,721
- Move!
- Let's get out of here!

307
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:03,990
- Come on!
- Keep going!

308
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,491
Oscar:
This way!

309

- Ah!
- Glenn: No!

310

Hershel:
Finally got Judith to sleep.

317
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,040
How are we with formula?

318
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:35,478
We have enough
to last us another month.

319
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:40,584
I'll tKe Carol for some more
at the end of the week.

320
00:24:40,585 --> 00:24:43,019
Your dad and the others
will be back by then.

321
00:24:44,554 --> 00:24:47,756
We don't know that.

322
00:24:47,757 --> 00:24:51,493
Right now, Judith is
the only family I got.

She's out keeping watch in
the guard tower with Axel.

326
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:01,769
What if they came back in
for something?

327
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,238
What if they're in trouble?

328

How could anyone else get in?

The tombs are filled
with walkers

331

that wandered in from outside.

332
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:11,178
Someone else could have
done the same thing.

333
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:14,249
- I'm going.
- I can't let you go down there.

334
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:17,884
My father would go.

- Just go.
- Let me take her.

I'll cover you.

It's me you want.

There's no need

This room is secure.
You'll be safe.

The glass has done
a lot of damage.

Prepared me for
the horrors outside.

435

00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:31,131
Put your hands up.

Turn around.
Turn around.

451
00:37:48,982 --> 00:37:53,085
- Get what you came for?
- Where are the rest of your people?

452
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:56,088
- They got Oscar.
- Daryl is missing. You didn't see him?

453
00:37:56,089 --> 00:38:00,925
- If anything happens to him--
- I brought you here to save them.

454
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:05,296
Thanks for the help.

455
00:38:05,297 --> 00:38:09,066
You'll need help to get
them back to the prison

456
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,536
or to go back
in there for Daryl.

457
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:15,872
Either way, you need me.

What can I say?

461
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:03,617
Hasn't been a night like this

462
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:05,952
since the walls were completed.

463
00:39:09,291 --> 00:39:11,758
And I thought
we were past it--

464
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:20,433
past the days when we all sat,

465
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:24,437
huddled, scared
in front of the TV

466
00:39:24,438 --> 00:39:27,340
during the early days
of the outbreak.

467
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:33,612
The fear we all felt then,

468
00:39:33,613 --> 00:39:36,147
<i>we felt it again tonight.</i>

469
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:42,987
I failed you.

470
00:39:46,392 --> 00:39:48,826
I promised to keep you safe.

471
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,631
Hell, look at me.

472
00:39:58,537 --> 00:40:01,071
You know, I--

473
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:04,907
I should tell you
that we'll be okay,

474
00:40:04,908 --> 00:40:07,810
that we're safe,

475
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:10,614
that tomorrow we'll bury
our dead and endure,

476
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:13,383
but I-- I won't,

477
00:40:13,384 --> 00:40:15,285
because I can't.

478
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,322
Because I'm afraid.

479
00:40:20,323 --> 00:40:22,324
That's right.

480
00:40:24,427 --> 00:40:29,131
I'm afraid of terrorists
who want what we have.

481
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,669
Want to destroy us!

482
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,671
And worse...

483
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:40,808
because one
of those terrorists...

484
00:40:43,412 --> 00:40:44,979
is one of our own.

And he let 'em in.

491
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:12,371
It was you.

492
00:41:12,372 --> 00:41:13,873
You lied,

493
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:16,275
betrayed us all.

494
00:41:26,786 --> 00:41:31,190
This is one of the terrorists.

495
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:38,162
Merle's own brother.

496
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:53,343
What should we do
with them, huh?

497
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,947
- Crowd: Kill them!
- What?

498
00:41:56,948 --> 00:42:00,116
- What you want?
- Crowd: Kill them!

499
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,259
( crowd chanting ) Kill them!

500
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:24,705
You wanted your brother.

501
00:42:24,706 --> 00:42:27,242
Now you got him.

502
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:49,415
