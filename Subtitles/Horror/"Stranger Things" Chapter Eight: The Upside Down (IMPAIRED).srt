Somebody, please!

[grunts]

00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,820
Let me out!

[Joyce breathing heavily]

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,630
[Dr. Brenner] Your son.

9
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,930
We know you've been in contact with him.

10
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,060
- [stammering] You have to let me...
- When...

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,770
and how did you make contact with him?

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,570
- What?
- Hmm?

13
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,860
Six.

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,240
What?

15
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,860
Six.

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,160
Six people have been taken this week.

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,790
This... thing that took your son...

18
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,840
[softly] we don't really understand it.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,420
But its behavior is predictable.

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,590
Like all animals...

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,930
it eats.

22
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,180
It will take more sons.

23
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,270
More daughters.

24
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,940
I want to save them.

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,480
I want to save your son.

26
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,150
But I can't do that.

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,320
Not without your help.

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,610
Stop.

29
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,290
I know who you are.

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,830
I know what you've done.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,130
You took my boy away from me!

32
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,960
You left him in that place to die!

33
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,050
You faked his death!

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,260
We had a funeral.

35
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,720
We buried him.

36
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,890
And now you're asking for my help?

37
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,560
Go to hell.

39

- [breathing heavily]
- Okay, now what do you know?

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,780
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,870
Did I stutter?

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,000
I told you.

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,460
Everything.

44
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,870
[electricity crackling]

45
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,130
What do you know?

46
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,710
[panting]

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,130
I know you do experiments
on kidnapped little kids,

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,590
whose parents' brains
you've turned to mush.

49
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,270
And I know you went
a little too far this time

50
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,260
and you messed up in a big way.

51
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,390
I mean, you really messed up,
didn't you? Big time.

52
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
That's why you're trying
to cover your tracks.

53
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,440
You killed Benny Hammond,
you faked Will Byers' death.

54
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,940
You made it look like
that little girl just ran away.

55
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,450
See, I told you.

56
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,120
- I know everything.
- All right, who are you working with?

57
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,410
Nobody.

58
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,660
But I did give all this
over to my friend at the <i>Times.</i>

59
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,516
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,920
You're just a junkie.

63
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,720
A small town cop
who had a really bad week.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,060
Took one too many pills this time.

65
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,940
You made a mistake coming back here.

66
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,600
No, I didn't.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,940
Here's what's gonna happen.

68
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,570
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go...

69
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,870
you're gonna give us anything we need,

70
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,990
and we're gonna find her son.

71
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,790
And then we're gonna forget
that any of this ever happened.

72
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, is that right?

73
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,590
Yeah.

74
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,760
That's right.

75
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,480
Nancy? Jonathan?

76
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,490
[door closes]

77
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,450
- They're gone.
- What?

78
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,886
Nancy and Jonathan.
His car's gone.

79
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,506
They're probably
just sucking face somewhere.

80
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,450
- [Lucas] Gross.
- No. No way!

81
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,620
Did they go with the chief?

82
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,700
I don't know.

83
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,410
No.

84
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,790
What? Did you see them?
Do you know where they went?

85
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,090
- Yes.
- Where? Where did they go?

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,220
Demogorgon.

87

You gotta give me your word.

92
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,420
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,180
And those other three kids, those boys,
you're gonna leave them alone.

94
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,310
Then I'll tell you.

95
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,600
Tell you where
your little science experiment is.

I don't understand.

99
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,880
We came to an agreement.

100
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,550
What?

101
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,236
Look, everything that's happened here
and everything that's gonna happen,

102
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,680
we don't talk about.

103
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,970
You want Will back?

104
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,680
This place had nothing to do with it.

105
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,310
That's the deal.
You got it?

106
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,240
What is this?

107
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,160
Protection.
The atmosphere is toxic.

108
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,620
[stutters] But my son's in there. He...

109
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,830
Put it on.

110
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,656
[Connie] I'm telling you,
this is a mistake.

111
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,720
[Dr. Brenner] It's gone.
Isn't that what you wanted?

112
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,560
And if they find the boy?

113
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,230
That's not gonna happen.

[Joyce] Yeah.

[Hopper echoing]
I need you to relax, okay?

120
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,790
I want you to slow down your breathing,
take deep breaths.

121

In and out.

122
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,750
Deep breath in...

123
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,840

124
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,470
In and out.

- No, Daddy! No, Daddy!

- Straight into Will's room. And...
- Don't step on the trap.

146
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,080
Wait for the yo-yo to move.

147
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,620
Then...

two...

You don't have to do this...

155
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,560
Jonathan, stop talking.

156
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,520
- I'm just saying, you don't have to...
- Three.

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,520
[Mike] Guys, guys! This is crazy.

158
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,900
We can't just wait around.

159
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,270
Mike, in case you forgot,
we're still fugitives.

160
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,796
The bad men are still looking for us.

161
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,756
Yeah, and we don't even know
where your sister is.

162
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
El can find them.

163
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,860
Mike, look at her.

164
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,676
I still think we should stick
to the chief's plan.

165
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,280
Exactly. We stay here,
keep El out of sight and keep her safe.

166
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,160
That's the most important thing, remember?

167
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,160
Besides, she's okay.
She's with Jonathan.

168
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,670
Yeah, and she's kind of
a badass now, so...

169
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,040
Well, where are you going?
You just said stick to the plan!

170
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,510
I am. I'm just gonna go get
some chocolate pudding.

171
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,670
I'm telling you,
Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.

172
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,010
[Mike] Are you serious?

173
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,760
El needs to be recharged!

174
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,140

[faint creaking]

177
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,990
Did you hear that?

178
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,250
It's just the wind.

179
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,380
Don't worry.

180
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,800
My mom, she said the lights speak
when it comes.

181
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,970
Speak?

182
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,090
Blink.

183
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,260
Think of them as alarms.

184
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,810
Is that too tight?

185
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,190
[stutters] No, it's fine.

186
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,480
Thanks.

187
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,040
Nancy?

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,500
Yeah?

[Steve] Jonathan?

191
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,880
Are you there, man?
It's... it's Steve!

192
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,470
Listen, I just want to talk!

193
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,760
[banging on door continues]

194
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,286
- Steve, listen to me.
- Hey. Nancy, what...

195
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,746
- You need to leave.
- I'm not trying to start anything, okay?

196
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,996
I don't care about that.
You need to leave.

197
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,360
[stammering] No, no, no.
Listen, I messed up, okay?

198
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,110
I messed... I messed up.

199
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,190
Okay?

200
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,030
Really. Please.

201
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,650
I just want to make things right.

202
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,030
Okay? Please. Please...

203
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,160
[stammers]

204
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,540
Hey, what happened to your hand?

205
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,870
Is that blood?

206
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,710
Nothing.
[stutters] It was an accident.

207
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,670
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Nothing.

208
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,540
- Wait a sec. Did he do this to you?
- No.

209
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,920
- Nancy, let me in!
- No. No! No, Steve!

210
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,026
- What is... What the...
- You need to get out of here.

211
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,906
- Whoa. What is all...
- Listen to me. I'm not asking you,

212
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,526
- I'm telling you, get out of here!
- What is that smell?

213
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,026
- Is that... is that gasoline?
- Steve, get out!

214
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,760
[stutters] Wait.
What? What is going on?

215
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,196
You have five seconds
to get out of here.

216
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,706
Okay, is this a joke?
Stop. Put the gun down.

217
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,520
- I'm doing this for you.
- Nancy.

218
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,826
- Wait. Is this a... What is this?
- Nancy.

219
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,860
- Three. Two.
- No, no, no! No, no!

220
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,650
Nancy! The lights.

221
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,530
- It's here.
- [Steve] Wait, what's here?

222
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,676
- [Nancy] Where is it?
- Where is what? Whoa!

223
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,200
- Easy with that!
- Where is it?

224
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,400
I don't know.
I don't see it.

225
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,450
Where is what?

226
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,290
Hello? Will someone please explain to me
what the hell is going...

227
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,476

[Steve] Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

232
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,890
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?

233
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,446
- What the hell was that?
- [both] Shut up!

[Nancy] What's it doing?

237
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,520
I don't know.

[electricity jolts]

239
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,580

No.

them red and she said she didn't know

249
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,606
and for pity's sake
not to ask her any more questions.

250
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,486
She said I must have asked her
a thousand already.

251
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,630
I suppose I had, too,

252
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
but how are you gonna find things out
if you don't ask questions?

And what does make roads red?

I don't think that's the monster.

312
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,220
Found it!
I knew she was hoarding it.

313
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,640
- I knew it.
- Yeah.

314
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,180
Always lying, saying she's out.

315
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,850
Bald-faced liar.

316
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,230
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!

Okay!

What's "putting"?

[chuckles] Pudding, it's...

322
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,960
it's this chocolate goo
you eat with a spoon.

323
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
Don't worry,

324
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,636
when all this is over,
you won't have to keep eating junk food

325
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,290
and leftovers like a dog anymore.

326
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,540
My mom,
she's a pretty awesome cook.

327
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,130
She can make you whatever you like.

328
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,500
Eggos?

329
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,840
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.

00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,680
See, I was thinking,

332
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,010
once all this is over and Will's back
and you're not a secret anymore,

333
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,600
my parents can get you
an actual bed for the basement.

334
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,390
Or you can take my room if you want,

335
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,020
since I'm down there
all the time anyways.

336
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,230
My point is, they'll take care of you.

337
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,020
They'll be like your new parents,

338
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,860
and Nancy,
she'll be like your new sister.

339
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,740
Will you be like my brother?

340
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,530
What? No, no. [scoffs]

341
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,160
Why "no"?

342
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,620
Because... [sighs]

343
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,750
'cause it's different.

344
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,080
Why?

345
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,210
[sighs] I mean, I don't know,
I guess it's not.

346
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,590
It's stupid.

347
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,880
Mike?

348
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,130
Yeah?

349
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,340
Friends don't lie.

350
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,640
[sighing] Well...

351
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,010
I was thinking...

352
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,310
I don't know...

353
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,140
maybe we can go
to the Snow Ball together.

354
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,190
- "Snow Ball"?
- It's this cheesy school dance,

355
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,980
where you go in the gym
and dance to music and stuff.

356
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,870
I've never been, but I know you're not
supposed to go with your sister.

357
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,570
- No?
- I mean...

358
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,780
you can, but it'd be really weird.

359
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,540
You go to school dances
with someone that, you know...

360
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,120
someone that you like.

361
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,170
- A friend?
- Not a friend.

362
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,630
[sighs] Uh... uh...

363
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,300
Uh, someone like a...

364
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,890
[car approaching]

365
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,310
Nancy.
Hold on, I'll be right back.

366
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,730
Stay here.

367
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,780
[tires screeching]

369
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,330
[agent] Go!

370
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,830
You two, on me.

371
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,090
This will charge your battery right up,
I'm telling you.

372
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,630
- [Mike] Guys! Guys!
- What is it?

373
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,300
[panting] They found us.

374
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,010
[agent] We know they're here.

375
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,640
Be advised,
west side of the building is clear.

376
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,166
[agent] Sir, we've searched everywhere.
There's no sign of them.

377
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,360
[indistinct radio chatter]

378
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,690
[agent] Nothin'.

379
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,030
Keep it locked down.

380
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,330
[agent] All right.

381
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,450
Kitchen.

382
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,710

[panting]

384
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,790
How did they find us?

385
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,436
I don't know,
but they knew we were in the gym.

386
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,630
Lando.

387
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,230
[agent] Got 'em!
[Mike] Go, go, go, go, go!

388
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,430
[Lucas] Come on!

389
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,670
[agents yelling indistinctly]

390
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,576
- There they are. Freeze.
- [Mike] Back! Go back!

391
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,390
[Mike] Go, go! Go left!

392

[Eleven thuds]

395
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,340
[Mike panting] El, are you okay?

396
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,010
El!

397
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,486
- Something's wrong.
- She's just drained.

398
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,840
No, no, no,
she won't wake up. El!

399
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,590
El!
[echoing] El!

400
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,010
[Hopper] There's more blood.

401
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,650
Oh, my God.

402
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,360
[Joyce] This way.

403
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,170
- She's barely breathing.
- We gotta go.

404
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,250
[Dr. Brenner] Leave her.

405
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,130
- Step away from the child.
- [Mike] No!

406
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,930
You want her,
you have to kill us first.

407
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,800
- That's right!
- Eat shit!

408
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,680
- Oh, no! No, no!
- No! No! Get off me!

409
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,100
- [screaming] You idiot!
- No!

410
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,310
[Dustin] Get off me!
[Mike] Ow! Let go!

411
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,560
Eleven?
Eleven, can you hear me?

412
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,690
Eleven?

413
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,650
Papa?

414
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,200
Yes, yes, it's your papa.

415
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,176
[Mike] Get off of me. [grunts]
[Dr. Brenner] I'm here now.

416
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,240
Let her go!
Let her go, you bastard!

417
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,870
[whimpering]

418
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,080
Shh, shh, you're sick.

419
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,250
You're sick,
but I'm going to make you better.

420
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,170
I'm going to take you back home,
where I can make you well again.

421
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,170
Where we can make all of this better,

422
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,170
so no one else gets hurt.

423
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,680
Bad.

424
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,850
Bad.

425
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,770

What?

430
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,950

You need to help get him out!

okay? [sniffles]

He's gone.
The bad man's gone.

459
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,550
We'll be home soon, and my mom...

she'll get you your own bed.

461
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,720
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.

And we can go to the Snow Ball.

00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,180
Goodbye, Mike.

El? El?

499
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,630
- El!
- [Lucas] Eleven!

[Dustin] Eleven!
[Mike] El!

501
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,050
El, where are you?

Eleven!

El?

[Joyce panting] Oh, God.

[sobbing] He's not breathing,
he's not breathing.

506
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,796
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen to me,
listen to me, listen to me.

507
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,610
- I need you to tilt his head back...
- Okay.

508
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,610
- ...and lift his chin.
- Okay.

509
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,200
One, two, three, four.

510
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
Now when I tell you,

511
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:27,160
you're gonna pinch his nostrils,
and breathe into his mouth...

512
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,170
- twice.
- Okay.

513
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,290
One second...

514
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,880
then pause.

515
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,630
22, 23.

516
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,750
- Then one second.
- Okay.

517
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
24, 25, 26, 27, 28...

518
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,800

Now! Go!

[Joyce whimpers]

520
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,570
- [Joyce] Oh, come on, come on.
- Come on...

521
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,480
Come on, kid.

522
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,680
- Come on, kid!
- Will!

523
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:49,980
Will, listen to me.

524
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,310
It's me, it's your mom
and I love you so much.

525
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,520
I love you so much.

526
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,820
I love you more
than anything in the world.

[Joyce sobbing]

531
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,160
I love you so much. I love you more
than anything in the world.

532
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,000
[sobbing] Please,
please come back to me. Just...

533
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,250
- Come on, kid!

<i>Come back to me, breathe.</i>

539
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,260
I need you to wake up now.

540
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,680
I need you to breathe.

541

[Will gasps and coughs]

544
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,310
[Joyce] That's it.

545

- Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.
- [coughing]

546

That's it, baby. Breathe.

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,320
Breathe. All right. Come on.

548
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,780
Come on.

Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.

Good, good, good, good.

551
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,910
Just breathe, Will, breathe.
[sobbing]

Michael!

[EKG monitor beeping]

560
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,760
Hey.

561
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,630
- Hi, sweetheart.
- [Jonathan] Hey.

562
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,600
Where... where am I?

563
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,890
[Joyce sighs]

564
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,600
[Jonathan] You're home.
You're home now.

565
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,480
You're safe.

566
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,190
Jonathan.

567
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,900
Yeah, it's me, buddy.

568
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,780
[sighs] We missed you.

569
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,700
We really missed you.

570

Are you okay?

571
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:55,620
What, this?

572
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,830
It's just a cut.
It's nothing.

573
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,750
You're worried about my hand.

[both chuckle softly]

[Jonathan] Oh, hey, uh...

576
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,140
We, uh...

577
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,430
We brought you some stuff...

578
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,100
so you don't get bored in here.

579
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,930
So... [sniffles]

580
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,980
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.

581
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,480
There's some stuff on there
I think you really might like.

Guys. Guys, he's up.
Will is up. Guys, Will's up.

[Lucas and Dustin grunt]

585
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,040
[Mike] Guys, come on.

586
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:21,710
- [Mike] Byers!
- [Dustin laughs]

587
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,580
[Joyce] Be careful.
Be careful with him.

588
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,250
[Dustin] Move.
[Jonathan] Guys, guys.

589
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,090
- [Mike laughs]
- [Jonathan] Go easy on him.

590
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,736
You won't believe what happened
when you were gone, man.

591
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,446
- It was mental.
- [Lucas] You had a funeral.

592
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,366
- Jennifer Hayes was crying.
- And Troy peed himself.

593
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:35,050
- What?
- In front of the whole school!

594
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,180
- [Lucas] Yes!
- [coughing]

595
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,640
You okay?

596
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,730
It got me.

597
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,900
The Demogorgon.

598
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,440
We know.

599
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,530
It's okay.

600
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,990
It's dead.

601
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,200
We made a new friend.

602
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,240
She stopped it.
She saved us.

603
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,200
But she's gone now.

604
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,870
- Her name's Eleven.
- Like the number?

605
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,266
Well, we call her "El" for short.

606
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,370
She's basically a wizard.

607
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,686
[whispers] She has superpowers.

608
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,710
More like a Yoda.

609
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,396
[Dustin] She flipped a van with her mind,

610
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,646
and these agents
were trying to shoot us...

611
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,736
- Yeah, it flipped over us...
- Then she squeezed the brains out...

612
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,800
[Dustin] And blood was pouring out
of their faces.

613
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,276
[Mike] It was pouring out of their eyes.

614
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,776
[Lucas] Agents just started
grabbing us and stuff...

615
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,320
- [Dustin] ...shot out of the wall...
- [continues indistinctly]

616
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,100
[Mike] Something is coming.
Something angry.

617
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,440
Hungry for your blood.

618
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,350
It is almost here.

619
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,586
- What is it?
- It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.

620
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,690
It's not the thessalhydra.

621
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,330
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.

622
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,860
- [loud thud]
- The thessalhydra!

623
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,530
- Damn it.
- [Mike] It roars in anger!

624
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,370
- Will, your action!
- What should I do? I...

625
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,120
Fireball him!

626
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,290
Fireball the son of a bitch.

627
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,000
- Fourteen!
- [all exclaim]

628
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,920
Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball
hits the thessalhydra.

629
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,010
It makes a painful...
[imitates screeching]

630
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:19,050
and then... it crumbles to the ground.

631
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,510
Its clawed hand reaches for you
one last time

632
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,180
and, and, and...

633
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,680
and...

634
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,390
[all cheering]

635
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,190
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,

636
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,280
and Dustin places them
into his bag of holding.

637
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,570
You carry the heads out of the dungeon,
victorious,

638
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,240
and you present them to King Tristan.

639
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,756
He thanks you
for your bravery and service.

640
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,740
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's not it, is it?

641
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,120
No, there's a medal ceremony...

642
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,370
Oh, a medal ceremony?
What are you talking about?

643
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,420
- And...
- The campaign was way too short.

644
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,040
- Yeah!
- It was ten hours!

645
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,186
But it doesn't make any sense.

646
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,670
- It makes sense.
- Uh, no, what about the lost knight?

647
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,210
And the proud princess?

648
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,696
And those weird flowers in the cave?

649
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,776
- I don't know, it's...
- [door opens]

650
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,970
[footsteps approaching]

651
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:02,140
Jeez, what's that smell?

652
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,946
Have you guys been playing games all day,
or just farting?

653
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,430
[chuckles] Oh, that's just Dustin.

654
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:06,680
He farted.

655
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,206
- Dustin farted. [blows raspberry]
- [Dustin] Okay.

656
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,496
- [Lucas] Dustin farted.
- Very mature, Lucas.

657
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,616
- [Lucas blowing raspberry]
- [Dustin] Oh.

658
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,100
- Will.
- [Dustin] Shut up.

659
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,286
[Jonathan] Come on.
[Lucas] Dustin farted!

660
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,320
[Will] Bye, guys.
[Mike and Dustin] Bye, Will.

661
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,940
[Mike] See you, Will.

662
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,360
- [chuckles] Stop.
- No, you stop.

663
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,700
- [Dustin] No, you stop.
- [both grunting]

664
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,660
[Dustin] Yeah, scream!
You're like a little girl.

665
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,950
[boys laughing]

666
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,630
- So, you have fun?
- Yeah.

667
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,760
[Karen] Hey, boys.

668
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,840
- Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.

669
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,930
Hey, wish your mom
a merry Christmas for me, okay?

670
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,850
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you. Uh, merry Christmas.

671
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,260
Merry Christmas.

672
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,930
- So, uh, you win?

673
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:52,690
- Awesome.

674
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,900
- Uh...

675
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,650
Thanks, um...

676
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,160
I... I didn't get you anything.

677
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,160
- I... I feel bad.
- No.

678
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,160
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.

679
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,370
It's, um... Well, you'll see.

680
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,050
Merry Christmas.

681
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,970
- You ready? Let's go.
- [Will] Yeah.

682
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,310
[sighs] All right. Buckle up.

683
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:38,650
Can I open it?

684
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,190
Yeah, sure.

685
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,280
Whoa.

686
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,360
Pretty cool.

687
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,580
[chuckles]

688
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,740
Yeah.

689
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,040
Yeah, pretty cool. [chuckles softly]

690
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,580
[snoring]

691
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,260
Did you give it to him?

692
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,390
Yeah.

693
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:20,400
[indistinct chatter]

694
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,960
You leaving already, Chief?

695
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:46,340
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted
to come to this thing? I was just hungry.

696
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,760
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.

697
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,850
Well, your wife doesn't have time
to cook for me, you know what I'm saying?

698
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,180
[Powell chuckling]

699
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,680
Merry Christmas, Hop.

700
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,310
- Mmm.

701
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,170
[dog barking]

702
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,800
- [Jonathan] What you got there?
- [Christmas music playing]

703
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,920
That one of yours?

704
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,010
- Yeah.
- [Jonathan] Looks pretty big.

705
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,680
Be careful.
You'll break it.

706
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,900
What are you...
What are you doing?

707
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,400
[Jonathan] Documenting.

708
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,860
Oh, why?

709
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,320
- Because...
- [Joyce chuckles]

710
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,570
- It looks great.
- Oh, this is just so overcooked.

711
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,200
- And look, the potatoes are runny.
- Mom.

712
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,620
- They're so runny.
- [chuckles] Mom, it's gonna be great.

713
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,200
- It's definitely an Atari.
- An a-what-i?

714
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,580
The green present.
It's an Atari.

715
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,290
I felt Dustin's today,
it's the same exact weight.

716
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:46,250
- Really? Well...
- [Will] Yeah.

717
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,000
We'll have to see, won't we?

718
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,630
Hey, no more snooping.

719
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,890
No, I forgot to wash my hands.
I'll be right back.

720
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,180
Okay.

721
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,310
- [softly] He's washing his hands?
- [chuckles]

722
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,400
[coughs]

723
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,030
[retches]

724
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,290
[groans]

725
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:40,350
- [Jonathan] Thanks.
- [both laughing]

726
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,730
Are you okay?

727
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,650
Yeah, I'm okay.

728
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,440
[Jonathan] Mmm. Very good, Mom.

729
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:53,650
Mmm. Hey, Mom.
Did Will tell you about, uh, the game?

730
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,900
- Oh, yeah.
- No. What game?

731
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,310
I threw a fireball at him and...
[imitates explosion] dead.

732
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,660
Wait, what is...
You mean, this is...

733
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:01,240
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.

734
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:03,080
- Dungeons & Dragons. Right.
- It's fun.

735
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,580
