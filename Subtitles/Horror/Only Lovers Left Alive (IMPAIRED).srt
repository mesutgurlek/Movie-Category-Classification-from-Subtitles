of the universe,

1133
01:55:02,579 --> 01:55:06,124
if you alter or affect one,

1134
01:55:06,125 --> 01:55:10,461
the other will be identically
altered or affected.

1135
01:55:10,462 --> 01:55:12,422
Spooky.

1136
01:55:12,423 --> 01:55:16,301
Even at opposite ends
of the universe?

1137
01:55:16,302 --> 01:55:18,725
Yeah.

1138
01:55:23,017 --> 01:55:25,815
EVE: Is that what we're thinking?

1139
01:55:27,479 --> 01:55:29,564
Adam, really.

1140
01:55:29,565 --> 01:55:33,365
So fucking 15th century.

1141
01:55:35,029 --> 01:55:38,954
They are deliciously beautiful,
though, aren't they?

1142
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:44,704
ADAM:
What choice do we have, really?

1143
01:55:44,705 --> 01:55:48,129
We're just gonna turn
them, though, right?

1144
01:55:48,959 --> 01:55:51,712
How romantic of you.

1145
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:56,099
I get the girl, though.

1146
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:08,107
(♪♪♪)

1147
01:56:26,705 --> 01:56:28,297
(SPEAKS FRENCH)

1148
01:56:39,134 --> 01:56:42,810
