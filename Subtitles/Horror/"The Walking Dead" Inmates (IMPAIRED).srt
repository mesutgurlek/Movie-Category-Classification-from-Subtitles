Or Molly's.

Whoever they are,
it means they're alive.

66
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:19,546
No. This means they were alive
four or five hours ago.

67

They're alive.

68

Yeah, faith. Faith ain't

nothing for your father.

Let's go.

stay here, huh?

I know.

348
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,073
So what are you doing?

349
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:24,411
I need your help.

We're gonna run out of bullets.

Take this and take this.

- ( lighter clinks )
- Back up.

353

All right. I need you to
stay ahead of me, okay?

354
00:38:04,664 --> 00:38:07,367
All right. I'll cover you,
but I can't do it alone.

355

You ready?

Let's go.

Go.

362
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,423
Did you see if any
of my people got out?

363
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:04,260
All I saw was my sister
in that field.

364
00:39:05,563 --> 00:39:07,897
She wasn't supposed
to be there.

365
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:11,670
She had a gun,
but they just swarmed her.

366
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:16,177
She wasn't
supposed to be there.

367
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:19,313
I did it for him.
I trusted him.

368
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,316
And then he just
killed that old man.

369
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:24,751
Hershel?

370
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:31,155
Was his name Hershel?

371
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:41,534
I'm sorry.

372
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:43,304
I'm so sorry.

373
00:39:46,072 --> 00:39:49,907
Brian, that man, told
us you were bad people.

374
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:51,977
I know it's not true.

375
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:55,477
I can see it's not,
so what we did, what I did...

376
00:39:58,149 --> 00:40:00,648
I mean, I'm a piece of shit.

377
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,983
Why would you want my help?

378
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,151
I don't want it, I need it.

379
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,853
I have to find Maggie.

380
00:40:17,387 --> 00:40:19,754
Who's Maggie?

381
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:22,859
She's my wife.

382
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:26,064
You guys got separated?

383
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:29,367
I was on the bus and then I got off
to help and she didn't see me.

384
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:32,170
How do you know if she made it?

385
00:40:32,172 --> 00:40:34,672
I don't know.

386
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:37,208
But Hershel,

387
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,410
Maggie's father,
was a great man.

388
00:40:41,013 --> 00:40:43,147
And he told me all I
had to do was believe,

389
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,715
and that's what I'm gonna do.

390
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:46,784
Neither one of us
should be alive right now.

391
00:40:48,853 --> 00:40:52,390
She got out, so you're
gonna help me find her.

392
00:40:54,026 --> 00:40:56,494
Things aren't over.

393
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,461
They're not over.

394
00:40:58,463 --> 00:41:01,029
I want to believe that.

395
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:05,467
I want to.
