A pot to piss in.

He thought
he came through here.

Why are we even so sure
he's going to attack?

Maybe you scared him off.

00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:42,946
He had fish tanks

He won't be expecting it.

Think this through clearly.
T-Dog lost his life here.

Lori, too.
The men that were here.

118

It isn't worth
any more killing.

What are we waiting for?
If he's really on his way,

120
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:41,571
we should be out
of here by now.

121
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:44,073
- And go where?
- We lived on the road all winter.

122

00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:46,640
Of course.

167
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,394
<i>( door bangs )</i>

168
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,130
Where's Martinez?

169
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,748
I don't know.

170
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:04,185
Did you see him leave?

171
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:05,419
Yeah.

172
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,272
Who was he with?

173
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:10,357
Karen, it's okay.
You can tell me.

174
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:13,644
I don't know anything.

175
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,200
Milton.

176
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:21,652
Milton, stop!

177
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,908
You startled me.

178
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,443
Where is he?

179
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:30,778
Where's who?

180
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,247
The Governor.

181
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,466
He's out on a run?

182
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,501
Is that an answer
or a question?

183
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,454
I'm not sure...
where he is.

184
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:42,956
I mean, not whether it was
a question or an answer.

185
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:46,260
- It was an answer.
- A run meaning what specifically?

186
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,629
Supplies would be a safe bet.

187
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,564
We were wiped out.

188
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:52,299
Milton, I want you
to give me a specific answer

189
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,819
to a specific question.
Where's the Governor?

190
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,638
On a run?

191
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,441
( sighs )

192
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,976
You know, I bet
he'll be back soon.

193
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:05,863
I'm sure he's okay, if that's
what you're worried about.

194
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,701
The tombs outside the boiler
room are overrun again.

195
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,369
That whole section
had been cleared.

196
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,488
It's a steady
stream of walkers.

197
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:16,874
Hershel:
We're wasting time.

198
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:20,494
The Governor is supposedly on the way
and we're stuck in here with walkers.

199
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:22,296
Trapped between a rock
and a hard place.

200
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,215
For the last time,
running is not an option.

201
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,934
Carol: Glenn, if the tombs
have filled up again,

202
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:28,502
it may just be a matter of
time before they push in here.

203
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:30,604
Or until some fence gives way.

204
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:32,673
Axel: <i>What if one of them
herds is passing through?</i>

205
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:34,391
Or settled?

206
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:37,344
Can't handle that
with just the few of us.

207
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:38,845
Okay.

208
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:40,481
All right, we need--

209
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,683
we just need to scout
the far side of the prison.

210
00:15:42,684 --> 00:15:44,952
- Find out what's going on.
- You're going out there?

211
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:47,121
- Take a car and make it quick.
- I'll drive.

212
00:15:47,122 --> 00:15:50,691
No, you stay here.
Help with the fortifications.

213
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,526
I'll take Maggie.

214
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,695
You sure she's up to that?

215
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:04,421
<i>( door opens )</i>

216
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,319
Where have you been?

217
00:16:25,493 --> 00:16:28,445
We need to find out how the walkers
are getting into the tombs.

218
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:37,237
Are we gonna talk about this?

219
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:43,344
Maggie, you need
to talk about it.

220
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,846
I do?
Or you do?

221
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,851
- What does that mean?
- <i>What do you want me to say?</i>

222
00:16:50,852 --> 00:16:54,188
You want me to say he made me get
naked and stand in front of him?

223
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:59,593
He came up behind me.

224
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:02,763
Pushed himself against me.

225
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,100
Put his hands all over me.

226
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:10,738
He slammed my head down
and bent me over a table.

227
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:16,043
Did he...

228
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,995
Rape me?

229
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,999
No.

230
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:27,554
No.

231
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,791
Do you feel better?

232
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,345
- I'm not trying to--
- I had a choice.

233
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,899
Either I take off my shirt
or he would take off your hand.

234
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,636
I just listened to Merle beating the
shit out of you in the other room.

235
00:17:44,972 --> 00:17:47,691
What could I do?

236
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:51,978
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,702
Go away.

238
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,454
You got your answer.

239
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,656
Now go away.

240
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:24,445
So we'll reinforce this with
some metal from the yard.

241
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:27,731
If anything happens,

242
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,183
we'll just duck.

243
00:18:30,184 --> 00:18:31,735
( laughs )

244
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,520
I hope nothing happens.

245
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:35,739
Guns scare the bejesus
out of me.

246
00:18:37,292 --> 00:18:40,127
I robbed a gas station
with a toy gun.

247
00:18:40,128 --> 00:18:42,162
Never even took it
out of my pocket.

248
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:45,966
You said Oscar was the thief.

249
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:48,302
That you were in here
for pharmaceuticals.

250
00:18:48,303 --> 00:18:51,171
Well, I didn't want y'all
to think I was a violent man.

251
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,307
If you follow me.

252
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,477
So what are you saying?

253
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:59,146
You're in here for a toy gun?

254
00:18:59,147 --> 00:19:01,098
No, listen to this.

255
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:04,017
The next day the cops found
me at my brother's house.

256
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,353
Still had the water pistol
in my pocket.

257
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,325
I swore up and down that that
was the only weapon I had,

258
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:14,661
but they said they didn't believe anyone
could be so stupid and get away with it.

259
00:19:14,662 --> 00:19:16,897
So they turned my brother's
house upside down

260
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:18,499
and found his .38.

261
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,501
Said it "matched
the description."

262
00:19:20,502 --> 00:19:23,570
There you go.
Armed robbery.

263
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:25,839
( laughs )

264
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,343
Tell you the truth, I don't even
know how to use this damn thing.

265
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,547
You're all about the truth now?

266
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,549
Yes, ma'am, I am.

267
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,518
( clicks )

268
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,803
It's fully loaded.

269
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,391
Let's hope it stays that way.

270
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,860
You're quite a lady.

271
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,650
Hmm...
( chuckles )

272
00:19:56,771 --> 00:19:59,740
Merle: Smells to me like
the Sawhatchee Creek.

273
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,875
Daryl:
We didn't go west enough.

274
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:04,211
There's a river down there, it's
got to be the Yellow Jacket.

275
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:06,246
You have a stroke, boy?

276
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,832
We ain't never even come
close to Yellow Jacket.

277
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:12,719
We didn't go west. Just a little
bit south. That's what I think.

278
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:16,390
( scoffs ) Know what I think?

279
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:18,926
I may have lost my hand,

280
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,344
but you lost your sense
of direction.

281
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,896
Yeah, we'll see.

282
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:24,565
What do you want to bet?

283
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:26,733
I don't want to bet nothing.

284
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,685
It's just a body of water.

285
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,687
Why's everything got to be
a competition with you?

286
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,739
Whoa, whoa.
Take it easy, little brother.

287
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,975
Just trying to have
a little fun here.

288
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:36,777
No need to get
your panties all in a bundle.

289
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,529
You hear that?

- Oh, come on.

and tell me it's raining, too?

293
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:50,040
That there's the sound
of a couple of coons

00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:05,365
( Spanish ) Help me, help me.

326
00:23:06,547 --> 00:23:09,483
( Spanish ) Watch out!
Watch out!

327
00:23:16,972 --> 00:23:19,403
<i>( baby crying )</i>

328
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:28,454
( Spanish )
Get away from my car!

329
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:31,007
Slow down, beaner.

330
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,793
<i>That ain't no way</i>
<i>to say thank you.</i>

331
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:36,512
( Spanish )
We don't have anything.

332
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:39,970
( Spanish ) They wanna take the car?
The tank is empty.

333
00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:41,684
Let 'em go.

334
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:48,641
The least they
can do is give us

335
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:51,310
an enchilada or something, huh?

336
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:54,080
Easy does it, señorita.

337
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:57,149
( sobbing )
<i>Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

338
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,919
<i>( rustling )</i>
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

339
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,788
( Spanish ) Stay back, my son.
Wait.

340
00:24:02,823 --> 00:24:05,375
<i>( Spanish ) Stay there.</i>
<i>( cans clanking )</i>

00:24:07,678 --> 00:24:09,379
<i>( bottle rattles )</i>

342
00:24:11,281 --> 00:24:14,116
( sighs ) Get out of the car.

343
00:24:14,117 --> 00:24:17,569
I know you're not talking
to me, brother.

344
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:21,373
Get in your car and get
the hell out of here.

345
00:24:21,374 --> 00:24:23,042
Go! Get in your car!

346
00:24:23,043 --> 00:24:24,576
( Spanish ) Go!

347
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:30,749

_

353
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:06,369
Merle: The shit you doing,
pointing that thing at me?

354
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,320
They were scared, man.

355
00:25:08,321 --> 00:25:09,956
They were rude
is what they were.

356
00:25:09,957 --> 00:25:11,824
Rude and they owed us
a token of gratitude.

357
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:13,593
They didn't owe us nothing.

358
00:25:13,594 --> 00:25:15,711
You helping people out of
the goodness of your heart?

359
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:17,997
Even though you might
die doing it?

360
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:20,967
- Is that something your Sheriff Rick
taught you? - There was a baby!

361
00:25:20,968 --> 00:25:24,003
Oh, otherwise you would have just
left them to the biters, then?

362
00:25:24,004 --> 00:25:27,607
Man, I went back for you.
You weren't there.

363
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:30,643
I didn't cut off your hand, neither.
You did that.

364
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:32,812
Way before they locked
you up on that roof.

365
00:25:32,813 --> 00:25:34,280
You asked for it.

366
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:40,987
( chuckles ) You know-- you
know what's funny to me?

367
00:25:40,988 --> 00:25:44,123
You and Sheriff Rick
are like this now.

368
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:46,025
Right?

369
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:47,827
I bet you a penny
and a fiddle of gold

370
00:25:47,828 --> 00:25:49,795
that you never told him

371
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:51,664
that we were planning on
robbing that camp blind.

372
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,966
It didn't happen.

373
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:56,302
Yeah, it didn't 'cause I
wasn't there to help you.

374
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:58,370
What, like when
we were kids, huh?

375
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:00,706
- Who left who then?
- What?

376
00:26:00,707 --> 00:26:03,092
Huh? Is that why
I lost my hand?

377
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:05,761
You lost your hand 'cause you're
a simpleminded piece of shit.

378
00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:07,430
Yeah?
You don't know!

379
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:09,849
( shirt rips )

380
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:18,991
I-- I didn't know
he was--

381
00:26:18,992 --> 00:26:21,226
Yeah, he did.

382
00:26:21,227 --> 00:26:23,562
He did the same to you.

383
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:26,065
That's why you left first.

384
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,568
I had to, man.

385
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:32,071
I would have killed
him otherwise.

386
00:26:32,072 --> 00:26:34,707
Where you going?

387
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:37,627
- Back where I belong.
- I can't go with you.

388
00:26:39,546 --> 00:26:42,381
I tried to kill
that black bitch.

389
00:26:42,382 --> 00:26:45,417
Damn near killed
the Chinese kid.

390
00:26:45,418 --> 00:26:47,470
He's Korean.

391
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:49,972
Whatever.

392
00:26:49,973 --> 00:26:53,192
Doesn't matter, man.
I just can't go with you.

393
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:57,763
You know, I may be
the one walking away...

394
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:01,934
but you're the one
that's leaving-- again.

395
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,753
Damn.

396
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:27,008
Glenn!

397
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:43,325
You're not going back
to Woodbury, are you?

398
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,962
No.

399
00:27:46,963 --> 00:27:50,131
I'm just going out there.

400
00:27:50,132 --> 00:27:52,033
- I'll go with you.
- I got it.

401
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:54,535
By yourself?

402
00:27:54,536 --> 00:27:57,672
How can you possibly think
that's a good idea?

403
00:27:57,673 --> 00:28:00,342
I can't just sit on my hands.

404
00:28:00,343 --> 00:28:02,761
You went on a simple
formula run

405
00:28:02,762 --> 00:28:04,846
and got the crap
beat out of you.

406
00:28:04,847 --> 00:28:06,815
- Maggie was attacked.
- Are you saying this is my fault?

407
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:08,549
- No.
- I did what I could.

408
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,151
I know you did.

409
00:28:10,152 --> 00:28:12,020
So does Maggie.

410
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:13,888
She's one of the two people

411
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:16,992
most precious to me
in this world.

412
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:19,894
I trust you with her life.

413
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:22,280
I still do.

414
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:25,867
This rage is going
to get you killed.

415
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:31,072
With Daryl gone
and Rick wandering Crazytown,

416
00:28:31,073 --> 00:28:32,707
I'm the next in charge.

417
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:40,765
What are you proving?

418
00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:48,423
( engine starts )

419
00:29:29,515 --> 00:29:31,799
She's hungry.

420
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:35,770
Could you help me feed her?

421
00:29:35,771 --> 00:29:38,273
I want to make Daddy
something to eat.

422
00:29:52,288 --> 00:29:54,322
Here.

423
00:30:01,597 --> 00:30:04,999
Just keep the bottle like this.

424
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,602
Otherwise she gets gassy.

425
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:11,773
Got it.

426
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:29,124
Here's this.

427
00:30:41,637 --> 00:30:43,871
Hershel:
<i>Rick.</i>

428
00:30:52,648 --> 00:30:54,649
<i>Rick.</i>

429
00:31:00,322 --> 00:31:02,657
<i>Rick.</i>

430
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:33,138
You know I wouldn't have
hobbled all the way down here

431
00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:35,523
if it wasn't important.

432
00:31:35,524 --> 00:31:38,810
Are you coming back soon?

433
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,931
Glenn's on the warpath.

434
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:46,818
<i>Smart as he is,</i>
<i>he can't fill your boots.</i>

435
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:48,837
<i>I'm afraid</i> <i>he's reckless.</i>

436
00:31:50,105 --> 00:31:52,940
We need you now more than ever.

437
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:55,410
Well, if you're
so worried about him,

438
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:58,246
you lead.

439
00:31:58,247 --> 00:32:01,249
What are you doing out here?

440
00:32:03,502 --> 00:32:06,054
I've--

441
00:32:06,055 --> 00:32:08,506
I've been--

442
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,511
I've got...

443
00:32:13,512 --> 00:32:15,563
stuff out here.

444
00:32:15,564 --> 00:32:18,433
Stuff.

445
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:21,603
How much longer do you need?

446
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:24,805
I don't know.

447
00:32:24,806 --> 00:32:27,375
I don't--

448
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:31,613
Is there anything
I can help you with?

449
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,160
I saw something.

450
00:32:57,973 --> 00:33:00,174
Lori.

451
00:33:00,175 --> 00:33:02,110
I saw Lor--

452
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:04,512
I'm seeing Lori.

453
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:10,184
Look, I know
it's not really her.

454
00:33:12,454 --> 00:33:14,489
<i>But there's got</i> <i>to be a reason.</i>

455
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:19,961
It's got to mean
something, you know.

456
00:33:21,196 --> 00:33:23,565
Was it her on the phone?

457
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:26,033
Yeah.

458
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:28,086
Shane, too.

459
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:30,705
And the town.

460
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:34,776
Do you see them now?

461
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:42,584
You're looking for them.

462
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:45,687
I'm waiting.

463
00:33:45,688 --> 00:33:47,989
For what?

464
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,326
I don't know.
Something.

465
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:55,697
There's an answer.

466
00:33:55,698 --> 00:33:58,866
I know it doesn't make sense.

467
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:01,068
Well, it does.
It can make sense.

468
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:05,206
I mean, I think in time
it will make sense.

469
00:34:05,207 --> 00:34:06,708
<i>Rick...?</i>

470
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:08,576
Come on in.

471
00:34:08,577 --> 00:34:10,845
You need rest.

472
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:16,100
<i>It's not safe</i> <i>out here.</i>

473
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,258
I can't.
I can't.

474
00:34:46,749 --> 00:34:49,334
Stress getting
to your man Rick?

475
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:50,718
Can you blame him?

476
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,887
No. Not at all.

477
00:34:52,888 --> 00:34:56,007
In here I've seen
plenty of dudes crack.

478
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:58,226
But not me.

479
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:01,312
I got on better on the inside.

480
00:35:01,313 --> 00:35:04,515
Things made more sense,
you know?

481
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:06,067
There were rules.

482
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:09,354
Life was more simple.

483
00:35:12,191 --> 00:35:14,776
Didn't you miss your brother?

484
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:16,911
My brother?
( laughs )

485
00:35:16,912 --> 00:35:18,446
Hell, no.

486
00:35:18,447 --> 00:35:20,314
He had a real money problem.

487
00:35:20,315 --> 00:35:22,867
- What kind of problem?
