Father Lozano's worked
in our chapel before.

He tells me that he's visited
you and your father often.

- Okay.

You had a car accident, Angela.

- Do you remember it?
- I want to go home.

Not what was going on
in the room, but...

500

It's hard to explain.

00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,480

and it wasn't the doctors.

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,660
It wasn't what was going on in the room.
It was...

505
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,240
It was another language,

Okay. Well, you were taking

It's a type of antibiotic

the doctor who administered your stitches

you said that

the babies were in your father's house.

You want to feel superior.

589

You leave work
and go talk to your own psychiatrist

590
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,620
and complain about your patients

591
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,520
and your boy-toy and how he left you
to go be with his wife.

And last week,

594
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,420
you went down on him in the parking lot

00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,724
Tell me about Angela's mom.

615
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,606
You never talked about her.

616
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,526

- It's all right.

619
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,048
She was a call girl.

620
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,290
I wasn't a customer.

621
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,089
I thought I could help her.

622
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,963
We had this

623
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,846
connection.

624
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,485
Pretty soon,
it became just the two of us.

625
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,322
And then I went to Japan.

626
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,380
And eight days into the transfer,

627
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,165
she calls me and tells me
that she's pregnant.

628
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,082
But she wants an abortion.

629
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,609
I begged her not to.

630
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,567
I sent her money to keep the baby,

631
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,250
but months later, I get a call
from the hospital telling me

632
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,289
my child was born
but abandoned by its mother.

633
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,688
Angela and I have been
together ever since.

634
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,206
There are some people at the diocese
that I want to talk to about Angela.

963
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,529
(KEYS CLACKING)

964
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,770
Come and see.

965
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,684
LOZANO: What is this place?

966
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,529
IMANI: These are the Archives,

967
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,929
where we keep the records
of the devil's work on earth.

968
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,246
Follow me.

969
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,380
IMANI: Much has happened
during your recovery.

970
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:53,060
MAN ON TV: Local officials remain unclear
on the cause of the explosion.

971
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:57,324
The victims have been identified
as US Army Colonel Roger Holmes,

972
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:59,300
26-year-old Peter Smith,

973
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,420
and Mattias Bruun,
a Cardinal residing at the Vatican.

974
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,540
A representative said that Bruun's visit
was not connected to Church affairs

975
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,723
and that he was in the US
on a personal vacation.

976
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,780
MAN ON TV: One of the survivors,
Father Oscar Lozano

977
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,300
from the Los Angeles Archdiocese

978
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:18,420
currently is recovering at
Saint Mary's Hospital from multiple injuries.

979
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,300
Another survivor, Angela Holmes,

980
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,220
was seen by a neighbor emerging
from the rubble without a scratch.

981
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:26,780
Miss Holmes reportedly has no memory
of the events leading up to the blast.

982
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,325
And then

983
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,260
it began.

984
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:35,763
Unbelievable event taking place
at the 6th Street homeless shelter.

985
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,380
MAN ON TV: Multiple miracles
have been reported

986
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,140
from the curing of a young girl
with leukemia

987
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,340
to restoring the sight of a man
who lost his sight in an industrial accident.

988
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,340
MAN ON TV: Hundreds of people
have gathered outside this shelter

989
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,500
in hopes that they, too, can be healed.

990
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,161
At that moment,
I could feel my legs again.

991
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,620
This isn't an isolated incident.

992
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:02,380
This is hundreds of people documented,
restored to health.

993
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:07,771
There is no medical
explanation for this.

994
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,020
So, what is it?

995
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,860
Where does this power come from?

996
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,962
Is it divine?

997
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,086
I don't know.

998
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,324
I just want to help
as many people as I can.

999
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,900
MAN ON TV: This only adds to the storm
of controversy surrounding Angela Holmes,

1000
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,820
who, in two short months, has inspired
an ever-growing legion of faithful followers.

1001
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,780
Some are calling her a saint,
others a charlatan.

1002
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,300
But tonight, thousands
have gathered inside this arena

1003
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:45,167
to find out first-hand if Angela Holmes
is, indeed, a miracle worker.

1004
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,540
(KNOCKING)

1005
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,961
MAN: Miss Holmes? It's time.

1006
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,691
BRUUN: The Book of Revelation says,

1007
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,340
one will come to mimic the Christ

1008
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,887
and the deceived will worship
this false prophet.

1009
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:21,900
And that is the day we most fear.

1010
