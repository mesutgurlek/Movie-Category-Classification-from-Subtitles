[ Shuddering ]

663
01:14:31,688 --> 01:14:33,704
My friend.

664
01:14:34,856 --> 01:14:37,352
[Wind Gusting]

665
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,584
Have you come for me, my love?

666
01:14:51,944 --> 01:14:55,880
You weren't so shy when you
took this outpost and me.

667
01:14:58,056 --> 01:15:01,224
Is this anyway to treat
your long-lost lover?

668
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:06,408
Who is this, Father?

669
01:15:06,504 --> 01:15:08,040
[ Chuckles ]

670
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,264
After we stormed the outpost,
she was waiting.

671
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,432
- She came to me in the night.
- What?

672
01:15:15,528 --> 01:15:18,312
[Chuckles]
And what pleasures we had.

673
01:15:18,408 --> 01:15:20,616
You're the reason
my wife killed herself!.

674
01:15:20,712 --> 01:15:22,920
Oh, no, no, no, love.

675
01:15:23,016 --> 01:15:26,280
That was your honor. It was your
face she watched when she jumped.

676
01:15:26,376 --> 01:15:30,472
- No.
- You whore!

677
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:32,488
Harsh words for the mother
of your child.

678
01:15:34,216 --> 01:15:38,920
- What?
- The beast, he's your son, Grendel.

679
01:15:39,016 --> 01:15:41,704
Conceived at the height
of victorious bloodshed.

680
01:15:44,008 --> 01:15:47,080
Impossible.
That thing's not human!

681
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:50,248
He's half.
That's why he's so handsome.

682
01:15:52,552 --> 01:15:55,624
- All this... for love spurned?
- Love?

683
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,544
You're so simple.

684
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:01,096
Long before the outpost was built
this was my land and my home.

685
01:16:01,192 --> 01:16:04,424
My son has the older claim.
He has come for what is his right.

686
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:08,840
I thank God now
for the opportunity to kill you.

687
01:16:08,936 --> 01:16:12,200

No!

[ Shrieking ]

691
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,400
[ Screaming ]

692
01:16:40,104 --> 01:16:43,080
That... was a mistake.

693
01:16:46,728 --> 01:16:49,224
No mistake.

694
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,912
I only kill when I have to.

695
01:16:52,008 --> 01:16:54,024
You kill for pleasure.

696
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,096
Their blood was sweet.

697
01:16:57,192 --> 01:17:01,320
I sucked their veins,
chewed their bones,

698
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,336
wet and still alive.

699
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:06,664
Hot blood pumping
down my throat.

700
01:17:08,488 --> 01:17:11,272
Mmm.

701
01:17:11,368 --> 01:17:14,152
You should try it.
It will appeal to you.

702
01:17:14,248 --> 01:17:16,936
You know nothing
about what appeals to me.

703
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:20,296
Don't l?
How will her blood taste?

704
01:17:20,392 --> 01:17:23,080
You've wondered.
You can't help it.

705
01:17:23,176 --> 01:17:25,768
You look at her,
your blood pumps.

706
01:17:27,496 --> 01:17:29,992
Your mouth becomes wet.

707
01:17:30,088 --> 01:17:33,064
You haven't confused that hunger
for something else, I hope.

708
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,560
I'm not confused.

709
01:17:35,656 --> 01:17:37,672
I know exactly why I'm here.

710
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,552
Tell me, what blood
mingles with yours?

711
01:17:44,648 --> 01:17:49,352
Who spread your mother's legs,
gave you strength to beat my son?

712
01:17:50,408 --> 01:17:52,616
Someone stronger than you.

713
01:17:52,712 --> 01:17:54,920
[ Chuckles ]
That's doubtful.

714
01:17:55,016 --> 01:17:59,816
I know you felt he pull towards me.
You can't help it.

715
01:17:59,912 --> 01:18:03,176
I need you inside of me.

716
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:09,128
You're on the edge of control now...

717
01:18:09,224 --> 01:18:11,592
with fresh kills inches away...

718
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:14,568
and me so close,

719
01:18:14,664 --> 01:18:17,352
aching for you.

720
01:18:24,552 --> 01:18:28,104
Does it burn in you, the hunger,

721
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,888
for blood, for flesh?

722
01:18:30,984 --> 01:18:34,824
Is it sweet to you,
the scent of my son's kills?

723
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,744
Tell me, hero.

724
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,872
Whose world do you
really belong to, theirs or mine?

725
01:18:40,968 --> 01:18:44,584
Here and now
it's just you and me.

726
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:46,792
And I will see you
pay for your sins.

727
01:18:46,984 --> 01:18:50,056
Do you dare?
Would you know me?

728
01:18:50,152 --> 01:18:54,088
I'm old, child--
older than sin.

729
01:18:54,184 --> 01:18:57,160
Would you take me here in the dark?
Do your loins at this moment,

730
01:18:57,256 --> 01:18:59,656
at this moment of death,
do they burn for me?

731
01:18:59,752 --> 01:19:03,400
I burn, but not for you.

732
01:19:03,496 --> 01:19:06,280
So be it.

733
01:19:06,376 --> 01:19:09,832
You've come for answers.
See what the truth brings you.

[ Flesh Tearing ]

735
01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:35,720
Come, sample the true delights
of flesh with me.

736
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,080
Feel what no human woman
can offer you.

738

Let's go.

747
01:21:37,608 --> 01:21:39,912
Come on. We have to go.

[ Whinnying ]

749
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:17,896
I lost everyone I loved
in that place.

750
01:22:19,144 --> 01:22:21,640
My whole life was there.

751
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:24,424
Where will you go?

752
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,232
With you.

753
01:22:28,328 --> 01:22:32,648
I don't know where I'm going,
Or what I'll find when I get there.

754
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:37,352
If I stay with you the darkness
will seek me out.

755
01:22:37,448 --> 01:22:39,368
And how would I protect you?

756
01:22:39,464 --> 01:22:42,248
I'll show you,

757
01:22:42,344 --> 01:22:44,360
if you let me.

758
01:22:45,512 --> 01:22:48,104
It's not safe to be with me.

759
01:22:50,312 --> 01:22:54,344
It's clear to me that by your side
is the safest place there is.

760
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,768
I can't make you any guarantees.

[Chuckling]

762
