01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,600
ARMAND:
Yes.

900
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,360
But very beautiful.

901
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,720
Welcome to my home.

902
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,280
Try him.

[VAMPlRES CHUCKLING]

904
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,040
Two vampires...

905
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,760
...from the New World...

906
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,080
...come to guide us into the new era...

907
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,560
...as all we love slowly rots...

908
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,480
...and fades away.

909
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,680
Are you the leader of this group?

910
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,080
If there were a leader...

911
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,120
...l would be the one.

912
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,000
-So you have the answers?
-So you have questions?

913
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,040
What are we?

914
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:16,360
Nothing...

915
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,480
...if not vampires.

916
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,760
LOUIS:
Who made us what we are?

917
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,280
Surely you know the one who made you?

918
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,400
LOUIS:
Yes, but the one who made him?

919
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:30,160
The source...

920
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,720
...of all this...

921
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,840
...evil.

922
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,920
I understand.

923
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,400
I saw you in the theater.

924
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,760
Your suffering...

925
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,440
...your sympathy for that girl.

926
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,480
You die...

927
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,080
...when you kill.

928
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,840
You feel you deserve to die
and you stint on nothing.

929
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,400
But does that make you evil?

930
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,800
Since you comprehend
what you call goodness...

931
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,600
...doesn't that make you good?

932
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,600
Then there is nothing?

933
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,320
ARMAND:
Perhaps.

934
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,800
But perhaps...

935
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:16,880
...this...

936
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,720
...is the only real evil left.

937
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,880
Then God does not exist?

938
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,520
I know nothing of God.

939
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:27,920
Or the devil.

940
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,240
I have never seen a vision,
nor learned a secret...

941
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:35,080
...that would damn or save my soul.

942
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,600
As far as I know...

943
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,600
...after 400 years...

944
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:44,800
...l am the oldest living vampire...

945
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,760
...in the world.

946
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,600
Then it's as I always feared.

947
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,720
You fear too much.

948
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,880
So much you make me fear....

949
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,920
The one who made you...

950
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,360
...should have told you this.

951
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,240
The one who left the Old World
for the New.

952
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:21,440
LOUIS: The one who made us
knew nothing, nor did he care.

953
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:22,640
Knew?

954
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:24,080
Come, beloved.

955
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:27,080
It's time we were on our way.

956
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,960
I'm hungry and the city awaits.

957
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,840
LOUIS:
The place was empty as we left.

958
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,720
Silent as the grave.

959
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,200
And as we blundered through it,
again came the thought:

960
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,480
"I have wronged Lestat.

961
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,600
I have hated him for the wrong reasons."

962
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,240
SANTIAGO:
How did you wrong him?

963
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,720
You said a name.

964
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,680
Yes, a name I don't care to say again.

965
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:55,280
SANTIAGO: There is but one crime
among us vampires here.

966
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,320
It is the crime that means death
to any vampire:

967
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,680
To kill your own kind.

968
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,480
-Do you think I'd let them harm you?
-No, you would not.

969
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,600
Danger holds you to me.

970
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,120
Love holds you to me.

971
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,720
-Love?
-Love.

972
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,120
You would leave me for Armand
if he beckoned you.

973
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,720
Never.

974
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,240
CLAUDlA: He wants you as you want him.
He's been waiting for you.

975
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:28,480
He wants you as a companion.
He bides his time in that place.

976
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,480
-He finds it as dull and lifeless as we do.
-Perhaps, yes.

977
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,360
Do you know what his soul said to me
without saying a word?

978
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,640
"Let him go," he said.

979
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,920
"Let him go."

980
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,400
Is that what I should do?

981
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,240
Let you go?

982
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,760
My father...

983
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:53,400
...my Louis, who made me?

984
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,720
It will be all right.

985
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,560
You really believe that?

986
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,800
The soldier, on returning from the war...

987
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,040
...thinks victory has inured him
against sorrow...

988
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,320
...till Death comes by...

989
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,720
...and chops him from his horse.

990
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:22,880
[APPLAUSE]

991
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,400
I was waiting for you.

992
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,120
Listen to me.

993
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,600
Claudia is very dear to me.

994
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,320
She's my daughter.

995
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:38,800
Your lover.

996
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,040
No, my beloved.

997
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,440
My child.

998
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,160
You say so. You're innocent.

999
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,000
She's in danger, isn't she?

1000
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,280
-She is.
-Why?

1001
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:55,520
ARMAND:
I could give you reasons.

1002
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,840
Her silence.

1003
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,400
Her youth.

1004
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,480
It's forbidden to make one so young...

1005
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,800
...so helpless...

1006
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,320
...that cannot survive on its own.

1007
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:11,120
LOUIS:
Then blame the one who made her.

1008
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,200
Did you kill this vampire
who made you both?

1009
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,040
Is that why you won't say his name?
Santiago thinks you did.

1010
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:18,600
-We want no quarrel with him.
-It's already begun.

1011
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,600
If you want to save her, send her away.

1012
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:24,880
Then I leave too.

1013
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,040
So soon?

1014
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,160
Without any of those answers
you so longed for?

1015
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,160
-You said there were none.
-But you asked the wrong questions.

1016
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,600
Do you know...

1017
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,120
...how few vampires...

1018
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:04,800
...have the stamina for immortality?

1019
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,880
How quickly they perish of their own will.

1020
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,320
The world...

1021
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:16,560
...changes.

1022
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:19,880
We do not.

1023
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,160
Therein lies the irony that finally kills us.

1024
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,480
I need you to make contact with this age.

1025
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:31,280
Me?

1026
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,480
Don't you see?

1027
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,680
I'm not the spirit of any age.

1028
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,440
I'm at odds with everything.

1029
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,200
I always have been.

1030
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,520
That is the very spirit of your age.

1031
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,360
The heart of it.

1032
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,880
Your fall from grace...

1033
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,200
...has been the fall of a century.

1034
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,440
But the vampires in the theater?

1035
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,360
ARMAND:
Decadent...

1036
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,400
...useless.

1037
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,000
They can't reflect anything.

1038
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:09,680
But...

1039
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,400
...you do.

1040
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,720
You reflect...

1041
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,440
...its broken heart.

1042
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,240
A vampire...

1043
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,200
...with a human soul.

1044
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,320
An immortal with a mortal's passion.

1045
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:40,680
You...

1046
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,480
...are...

1047
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:45,840
...beautiful, my friend.

1048
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:51,280
Lestat must have wept when he made you.

1049
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,000
Lestat?

1050
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,720
You knew Lestat?

1051
01:25:58,440 --> 01:25:59,720
Yes.

1052
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,200
I knew him.

1053
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,920
Knew him well enough
not to mourn his passing.

1054
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,360
LOUIS:
I felt a kind of peace at last.

1055
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:17,200
I had found the teacher which Lestat
could never, I knew now, have been.

1056
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:20,880
I knew knowledge would
never be withheld by Armand.

1057
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:24,520
It would pass through him
as through a pane of glass.

MADELEINE: Drink.
LOUIS: Uch.

1061
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,560
Do it, Louis.

1062
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,480
Because I cannot do it.
I haven't the strength.

1063
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,280
You saw to that when you made me.

1064
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,880
You haven't the vaguest conception
what you ask.

1065

[SPEAKS IN FRENCH]

1066
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,000
I have.

1067
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,360
You have found your new companion!
You will make me mine!

1068
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:17,840
How do we seem to you?

1069
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,320
Do you find us beautiful?

1070
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,040
Magical?

1071
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,720
Our white skin, our fierce eyes?

1072
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,720
"Drink," you ask me.
Do you know the thing you will become?

1073
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:30,160
Your evil is that you cannot be evil.

And I shall suffer for it no longer!

1075
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,440
Don't make me do this. I cannot!

1076
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,240
Yet, you could do it to me.

1077
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:42,520
Snatching me from my mother's hands,
like two monsters in a fairy tale.
