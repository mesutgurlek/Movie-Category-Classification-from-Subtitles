1
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,560
<i>In the movies, Dracula wears a cape,</i>

2
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,000
<i>and some old English guy</i>
<i>always manages to save the day</i>

3
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,664
<i>at the last minute</i>
<i>with crosses and holy water.</i>

4
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,342
<i>But everybody knows</i>
<i>the movies are full of shit.</i>

5
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:49,179
<i>The truth is it started with Blade,</i>
<i>and it ended with him.</i>

6
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,740
<i>The rest of us</i>
<i>were just along for the ride.</i>

7
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,142
What's this chicken scratch?

8
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,610
It's cuneiform.

9
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,017
It's about 4,000 years old.

10
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:09,813
So why here?

11
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,824
Because this is the cradle of civilization.

12
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,851
He would've been comfortable here.

13
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,421
I don't know, Dan.
This seems like another dead end.

14
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,761
There's something beneath us.

15
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,698
You find a watch?

16
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,171
Is it a body?

17
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,605
Guys?

18
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,083
Aah!

19
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,548
Go! Aah!

20
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,419
What the fuck?!

21
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,668
Aah!

22
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,237
Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance,
forensic psychiatrist

23
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:14,048
and author of the <i>New York Times</i>
bestseller <i>Human Health,</i>

24
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,247
<i>The Whole Being Breakthrough.</i>

25
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:20,349
Also with us, Martin Vreede,
Chief of Police.

26
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,192
They'll be here for the next hour,
and they'll be taking your calls,

27
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,665
next on <i>Bently Tittle Live.</i>

28
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,167
Okay, Dr. Vance.

29
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,765
You are a psychiatrist
and a biochemist. Isn't that true?

30
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,333
Yes, Bently. I am both.

31
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,901
And it's for a reason.

32
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,507
I have always believed
that true health can only be achieved

33
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,246
if we reconcile
the body and the mind.

34
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,254
And of course,
in order to do that,

35
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,756
we have to get rid
of a lot of old notions.

36
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,419
Okay. And... how's that
fit in with vampires?

37
00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:00,660
In the case of vampires,
we're dealing with creatures that, uh,

38
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,794
are the repositories of some
of our most taboo thoughts.

39
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,532
- Okay.
- Predatory rage.

40
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,506
- Yeah.
- Sexual sadism.

41
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,769
- Sexual?
- Sexual sadism.

42
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,243
These are very scary subjects
for people to own up to,

43
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,780
and they're right inside.

44
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:19,045
So what you're saying is
we pass the buck onto someone else.

45
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,246
- You bet we do.
- And vampires...?

46
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,984
Well, for instance,
there's a hereditary blood disease.

47
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:27,219
I talk about it in my book.
It's called porphyria.

48
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,454
And the symptoms of this disease

49
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:33,363
are remarkably similar
to classic vampire traits.

50
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,425
The people who suffer
from this disease are anemic,

51
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,529
they become intolerant to sunlight,
they can't handle garlic...

52
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,097
Garlic?
Chief Vreede. Okay.

53
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,112
What's your take on all these rumors
we've been hearing about vampires?

54
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,340
Vampires, vampires. What?

55
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:53,078
The only vampires I'm worried about
are the ones passing the bar exam.

56
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,383
Seriously, though.

57
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,791
If vampires existed, don't you think
we would've found them by now?

58
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,796
The truth is our streets
have never been safer.

59
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,459
Homicide, assaults, violent crime
is down across the board.

60
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,263
If people want to be concerned,

61
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,362
they should focus in on characters
like this Blade criminal.

62
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,497
Now, that's the guy I wanna hear about.

63
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,338
I wanna hear about this character Blade.
What about him?

64
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,970
He's a sociopath
that we've been pursuing.

65
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,709
Blade is a troubled individual.

66
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,217
I understand that he is
under the impression

67
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,310
that there is a vast conspiracy
of vampires.

68
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,389
Now, you've got to look
at the psychiatric underpinnings

69
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,949
of a belief like that.

70
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:40,329
Odds are he believes
that he is out there slaying monsters.

71
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,493
- But what he's really doing...
- Mm-hmm.

72
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,826
...is trying to kill
aspects of himself.

73
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:54,709
Aah!

74
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,485
Aah!

75
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,079
Ah!

76
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,297
Aah!

77
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,660
I'm on the Stonebridge overpass.

78
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,136
Got it. Heading westbound.

79
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,298
I'm just beneath ya.

80
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,841
Go!

81
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,925
Aah!

82
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,773
Aah!

83
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,303
Come on!

84
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,710
I got him. Pull!

85
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:49,937
You all right, man?

86
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,095
He's got a gun!

87
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,481
Oh, my God!

88
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,023
Ouch.

89
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,734
Staked you with silver.

90
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,661
Why aren't you ash?

91
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,899
Why aren't you smarter?

92
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,442
Not a vampire, dumb shit!

93
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,041
Set your sorry ass up.

94
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,066
Damn.

95
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,426
Oh, Blade.

96
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,467
What the fuck happen tonight?

97
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,738
How should I know?

98
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,177
He was human.

99
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,311
You're gettin' reckless, Blade.

100
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,213
Killing vampires is clean.

101
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:42,015
They ash... don't leave
any evidence behind.

102
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,611
Killing humans is messy.

103
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,623
You better hope nobody ID'd you.

104
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,617
This worked really good.

105
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:53,959
What's this?

106
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,365
A new delivery system for your serum.

107
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,426
It's an effervescent inhaler.

108
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,301
Just bite down on the mouth guard.

109
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,465
Delivery's automatic.

110
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,133
Some friends of mine made it.

111
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,335
Friends?

112
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,210
Yeah.
You remember those?

113
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,771
<i>It was horrible.</i>

114
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,286
<i>The one car crashed, and then the guy</i>
<i>in the coat was shooting the other guy.</i>

115
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,685
- <i>It looked like there was a lot of blood.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

116
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,950
<i>That was just a taste</i>
<i>of the mayhem that occurred</i>

117
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,719
<i>during tonight's brazen shootout</i>

118
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,023
<i>that left at least four people dead.</i>

119
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,995
<i>Now, apparently, an anonymous citizen</i>

120
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,861
<i>captured the whole event on video.</i>

121
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,763
Hey, Ray.
Hey, we got a lead.

122
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,267
Let's catch a plane, Wilson.

123
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,031
It's time to take these cowboys down.

124
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,770
That's what I'm talkin' about.

125
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,139
What's he been doing?

126
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,870
Fuck all. Just feeding.

127
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,536
Been through five of them so far.

128
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,170
Do you think we have enough security?

129
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,444
We didn't capture him.
He allowed us to take him in.

130
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,541
You understand?

131
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,051
I'm gonna go in.

132
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,480
You shouldn't have woken me.

133
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,586
We had to.

134
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:43,697
Your blood, your sacrament,
can set us free now.

135
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,133
What makes you think I care?

136
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,503
Your people need you.

137
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:49,939
My people?

138
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:57,043
You're nothing but shadows
of your former selves.

139
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,482
Look how far you have fallen.

140
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,746
The world's changed since your time.

141
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,651
The humans have a new hunter.

142
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,623
Blade.

143
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,752
And you'd like me
to kill him, wouldn't you?

144
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,989
Yes.

145
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:40,847
Subject is heading west.

146
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,053
Got him.

147
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:48,324
Congratulations.
You're famous.

148
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,833
Somebody nailed us.

149
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,530
Your face is all over the papers
and television.

150
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,367
Media's eatin' it up.

151
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,067
- Like I care.
- Well, you should.

152
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:59,941
Something like this...
taking out a human...

153
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,674
as far as the rest
of the world is concerned,

154
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,943
you're public enemy number one.

155
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,952
Didn't know this was
a popularity contest.

156
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,654
Damn it, Blade.
Don't you see what they're doing?

157
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,817
They're waging
a goddamn P.R. Campaign.

158
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:18,056
Now it's not just vampires
we gotta worry about,

159
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,327
we're gonna have to take on
the rest of the world, too.

160
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,234
You worry too much, old man.

161
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,603
That's why we're still alive, goddamn it.

162
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,141
I've been doing this
since before you were born, Blade.

163
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,940
You're like a son to me.

164
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,843
I'm sorry I got old on ya.

165
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,078
I see you alone,
surrounded by enemies.

166
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,052
And it breaks my heart.

167
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,557
We can't win this war alone.

168
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,761
Look, he just gave me the evil eye.
Come on, man.

169
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,265
What about that guy?!

170
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,734
Bro and prostitute, baby.

171
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,467
So what?

172
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,372
Quit fucking around.

173
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,536
I'm hungry,
and I want to eat somebody.

174
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,644
How about him?

175
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,445
No fatties.
They taste like Cheetos.

176
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,519
No, I like him.

177
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:20,856
Wait... what about that?
Shrunken apple-headed bitch.

178
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,587
They fucking saw us over there.

179
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:26,188
Fucking blow me, man!
Just pick one already. Jesus Christ!

180
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,756
Oh, got it! Got it!

181
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,692
Baby on board.

182
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,569
Oh! Looks like we got ourselves
a combo meal!

183
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,118
Chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky, chicky!

184
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,800
Oh, yeah, baby!

185
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,705
What's for dinner?

186
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:57,848
Aah!

187
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,680
Hey, pretty lady.

188
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,431
No! No!

189
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,762
No!

190
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,067
Scream if this hurts, chica.

191
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,978
Aah!

192
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,905
Fuck you?

193
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,746
Aah!

194
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,445
Garlic!

195
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,381
Scream if <i>this</i> hurts, chica.

196
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,819
Aah!

197
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,246
What is it?

198
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,181
What you were worried about.

199
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,909
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

200
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,677
<i>Shoot to kill!</i>

201
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,582
Aah!

202
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,838
Move a finger and you're dead.

203
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:47,640
How's about this one?

204
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,111
He's got something in his hand!

205
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,579
Get out, Blade!

206
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,211
Shit!

207
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,895
What's going on in there?

208
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,406
Somebody talk to me!

209
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:26,350
Aah!

210
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,020
Hold it right there!

211
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,489
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

212
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:22,907
Rise and shine, sleepyhead.

213
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,146
Special Agents Ray Cumberland,
Wilson Hale, FBI.

214
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,741
- We've been tracking you a long time.
- Mm-hmm.

215
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,876
Whistler.

216
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,216
Dead.

217
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,752
Just like all your victims.

218
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,155
Say, how many people
have you killed, Blade?

219
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,595
Thirty? Forty? Fifty?

220
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,129
1,182.

221
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,394
But they were all familiars.

222
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,462
People who work with them.

223
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,374
Oh. And by "them,"
you mean vampires, right?

224
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,742
Say, so how do you kill
these bloodsuckers, tough guy?

225
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,748
Maybe you could give us a few pointers.
You can stake 'em, right?

226
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,080
What about sunlight? I mean,
they ain't feelin' sunlight, right?

227
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,312
What about crosses?

228
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,217
Do they still work, Wilson,
in this day and age?

229
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:14,019
I don't know, Ray. I mean, what if
mister homey vampire is, like, Jewish?

230
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,123
That's a good point.

231
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,596
What about garlic?
Does that work on Hindu vampires?

232
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,634
Or do you need, like, saffron
or some shit?

233
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,296
- That was quick.
- Thank you.

234
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,577
You can keep doing your song
and dance as long as you want, Blade.

235
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,170
It's not gonna play.

236
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,674
We know what you are.

237
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,513
You're a stone-cold killer.

238
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:42,246
And you're sick as fuck.

239
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,880
Let's leave the diagnosis
to the professionals.

240
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,822
Hello, Blade.

241
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,690
My name is Dr. Vance.

242
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,527
I've been charged with giving you
a psychiatric evaluation.

243
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,860
Gentlemen, would you mind giving us
just a couple of minutes alone?

244
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,733
He's all yours.

245
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,843
I know you must find this
very frightening...

246
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:20,490
...but I want you to know
that I'm here to help.

247
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,287
And in order for me to do that,

248
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:27,593
I'm gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions, okay?

249
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,333
You know, Blade...
the darndest thing.

250
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:37,363
I was signing in at security,
and, uh, couldn't remember the date.

251
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,468
Do you know what day it is?

252
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:49,177
How about the President?
You know who <i>that</i> is.

253
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,279
Who's in the White House right now?

254
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,324
An asshole.

255
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,994
I think somebody here
wants to talk about vampires.

256
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,890
Vampires.

257
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,333
For everyone else,
it's kind of silly.

258
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,703
I had a set of wax teeth
when I was seven years old.

259
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,210
It was fun.

260
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,212
I could be somebody else.

261
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:25,547
But I want to hear <i>you</i>
talk about vampires.

262
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:28,555
What can you tell me about them?

263
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,490
They exist.

264
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,230
Are you one of them?

265
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:42,366
Sometimes...
the scariest monster of all...

266
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,936
...is the one in the mirror.

267
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,582
Tell me about blood.

268
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,618
When you drink blood,

269
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,621
do you ever feel sexually aroused?

270
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:06,090
Just strikes me
that this business of vampirism

271
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:12,160
has a very strong element
of sexual confusion.

272
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,298
Nuzzling into someone's neck.

273
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,504
A nocturnal visit.

274
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:25,013
It promises a...
delicious physical intimacy.

275
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:32,214
The very sweet taste of saliva...

276
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,848
mixed with skin.

277
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,988
Sounds good to <i>me.</i>

278
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,128
Where's it come from?

279
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,826
That's what I wanna know.

280
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:49,203
And I'm starting to wonder what your
relationship with your mother was like.

281
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,541
Were the two of you very close?

282
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,348
He's psychotic.

283
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,410
No shit.

284
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,683
For his safety and for the public's,

285
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,055
I'm recommending that he be transferred
immediately to County Psychiatric...

286
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,889
Fuck that!
That man is my prisoner.

287
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,191
He's wanted in connection
with a laundry list of federal crimes.

288
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,527
Hold on, gentlemen.
We're in my jurisdiction now.

289
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,033
You got a problem with that,
you talk to the local magistrate.

290
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,001
- That man is my prisoner!
- The call has already been made.

291
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,298
Don't fuck with my thing!

292
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,101
There's a team from the hospital
effecting the transfer immediately.

293
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,108
You're supposed to be
working with us on this, Chief.

294
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,165
Not this time.

295
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:35,349
This is just a little something
to keep you compliant.

296
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:40,451
The usual dose for this sort of thing
is two, three hundred milligrams,

297
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:45,553
but I think with a big,
strapping hybrid like yourself,

298
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,155
I'll kick it up to a couple thousand.

299
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,666
You don't have a problem
with needles, do ya?

300
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,535
There.

301
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,004
That wasn't so bad, was it?

302
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,109
Ooh, you're weak.

303
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,710
In need of your serum.

304
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,440
That must be a bad feeling.

305
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,412
I mean, who would've imagined

306
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,547
that a mere human like me
could overpower you.

307
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,284
You're one of them.

308
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,290
A familiar.

309
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,396
Going on five years now.

310
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,099
It's the endgame, Blade.

311
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,201
All their plans are coming to fruition.

312
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,849
Why don't you just sit back
and enjoy the show?

313
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:51,026
I hate familiars.

314
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,404
<i>It's why we're still alive, goddamn it.</i>

315
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,972
<i>You're like a son to me.</i>

316
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:12,546
<i>Sorry I got old on ya.</i>

317
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:18,120
<i>I see you alone,</i>
<i>surrounded by enemies.</i>

318
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,157
<i>It breaks my heart.</i>

319
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,714
Hi, Blade.

320
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,582
So glad to finally meet you.

321
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,622
I am such a fan.

322
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,984
I like your tattoos.

323
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,451
Do they mean anything?

324
00:34:58,629 --> 00:34:59,857
Stupid.

325
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,193
Are you okay?

326
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,961
Are you tired?

327
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,061
You're weak.

328
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,443
We moved the humans around.

329
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,706
Like pawns.

330
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,282
We used them...

331
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,676
...to flush you out.

332
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,359
You're not so big.

333
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,432
You're all alone, Blade.

334
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,562
No one's gonna help you now.

335
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,226
- Evening, ladies.
- Hannibal King!

336
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,698
Wake up, Blade.
This is your rescue.

337
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,406
Go!

338
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,227
Freeze!

339
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:02,539
Whistler!

340
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,080
This way!

341
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,824
Blade!

342
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,359
You're dead!

343
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,254
Get down!

344
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,694
Blade.

345
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,574
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

346
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,670
Where are you going?

347
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,408
Where the fuck is he going?

348
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,712
This is supposed to be a rescue!

349
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,083
Get back, get back!

350
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,320
We're pinned down.

351
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,522
I can't shoot around corners.

352
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:54,655
<i>I</i> can.

353
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,471
Aah!

354
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,292
Okay. We're fucked.

355
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:01,490
We're fine.

356
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,371
Forgot my sword.

357
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,886
Whoo! Come on!

358
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,838
Abby.

359
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,271
Aah!

360
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:51,976
We got him.

361
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,676
We'll be there soon.

362
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,480
Who the hell are you people?

363
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,386
Well, my name is Hannibal King.

364
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,788
And this little hellion
right here is Abigail.

365
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,690
Whistler's daughter.

366
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,934
I thought the vampires
killed Whistler's family.

367
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:21,569
They did.
I was born later out of wedlock.

368
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,877
When I came of age,
I tracked my dad down,

369
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,349
and I told him I wanted in.

370
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,909
Been doing it ever since.

371
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,686
Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.

372
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,788
How do you bankroll this operation?

373
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,333
I date a lot of older men.

374
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,726
Come on, man, I'm joking.

375
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,499
You met Dex.

376
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:49,903
This is Hedges.

377
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,841
Sommerfield... she's the one who built
that new serum inhaler of yours.

378
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:58,041
That runt you saw earlier,
that was Sommerfield's daughter Zoe.

379
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,947
We call ourselves the Nightstalkers.

380
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:06,087
Hmm. Sounds like rejects
from a Saturday morning cartoon.

381
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,956
We were gonna go with
the Care Bears, but, uh, that was taken.

382
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,691
How many of you are there?

383
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,891
There's enough.

384
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,627
We operate in sleeper cells.

385
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,135
When one goes down, another cell
activates to pick up the slack.

386
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,002
Consider us your reinforcements.

387
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,776
What, you amateurs
are supposed to be helping me?

388
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,378
You?

389
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,813
Look at you.

390
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,145
You're kids.

391
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,543
You're not ready to roll with this.

392
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,122
I mean, look at the way you're dressed.

393
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,953
What, that's supposed to be tactical?

394
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:44,988
What is this? What is that?
"Fuck you."

395
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,495
It's a joke, huh?

396
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,597
What the fuck is wrong with y'all?
Y'all think this is a joke?

397
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,329
You think this is a fucking sitcom?

398
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,396
Okay, first off, that's just rude.

399
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:59,340
Second, I'm pretty sure
we saved your ass back there.

400
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,608
I'm impressed.

401
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,844
Look, Blade, my father meant
for us to help you.

402
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,852
Like it or not, we are all you got.

403
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,151
What the hell makes you think
you know about hunting vampires?

404
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:16,954
Well, here's for starters.

405
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,127
I used to be one.

406
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:21,964
Do I pass the audition?

407
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,166
Rookies.

408
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,370
Fucking Hannibal King!

409
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:32,136
I should've ripped his bleeding heart
out when I had the chance!

410
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,841
Ugh!

411
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,979
Ugh!

412
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,680
We had Blade.

413
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,117
We had him!

414
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:44,484
Ugh!

415
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,057
And don't tell me "I told you so," Asher.

416
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,059
What's wrong, half pint?
You need a time out?

417
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,287
Blow me.

418
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,926
We got caught with our pants down.

419
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,364
Pants down?

420
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,596
They pretty much
fucking ass-raped us.

421
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:01,103
Oh, you loved it.

422
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:02,798
Has he been told?

423
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,474
About your failure?

424
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:07,701
Yes.

425
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:11,707
Maybe it's time I joined the game.

426
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,955
You know the kind of woman
that just screams trouble?

427
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,719
You see her and every warning bell
in your brain starts going off,

428
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,857
but you still manage to ask
for her number.

429
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,901
Well, that's all I ever hook up with.

430
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,732
But <i>this</i> betty...

431
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:39,006
Whoa! She blew 'em all away
in the shitstorm sweepstakes.

432
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,239
Her name is Danica Talos.

433
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,903
You met her earlier.

434
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,472
And unlike typical vampires,
her fangs are located in her vagina.

435
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:50,811
Moving on.

436
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,823
The man on her left
is her brother Asher,

437
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:57,452
and this walking diaper stain
is Jarko Grimwood.

438
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,155
I picked Danica up in a bar

439
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:01,459
and spent the next five years
playing hide-and-go-suck

440
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,000
as her little vampire cabana boy.

441
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,559
Eventually, Abigail found me.

442
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:10,266
Sommerfield managed to treat me
with a cure, and now I kill them.

443
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,709
And that's basically
turning a frown upside-down.

444
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,777
We need to pool our resources, Blade.

445
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:20,776
"We"?

446
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,150
Yeah, we.

447
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,820
He's come back.

448
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,826
Take a look at this.

449
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:37,398
You gotta be kidding me.

450
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,172
Where'd you guys
get this stuff?

451
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,644
I stole most of it.
Danica had a huge collection.

452
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:54,707
You got stonework, ironwork,
weaponry, art.

453
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,845
It's this stuff that shows up everywhere.
This symbol, this glyph...

454
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,048
It's on everything in here.

455
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,457
He is real.
You dig beneath all the... the myths,

456
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:07,657
all the layers of bullshit that have cluttered
our culture for the last 500 years,

457
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,029
and eventually
you're gonna strike the truth.

458
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,935
So the movies are true.

459
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:17,337
The movies are just a comforting
fairy tale compared to the real deal.

460
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,170
Bram Stoker... he wrote a good yarn,

461
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:22,406
but the events that he described
back in 1897...

462
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:25,039
God. That was just a tiny piece
of the mosaic.

463
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:30,815
The real Dracula... his origins
date back much, much earlier than that.

464
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,150
How early?

465
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,349
Try six or seven thousand years.

466
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,520
This is a piece of his armor.

467
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:40,085
With it, we were able to extrapolate a
basic idea of what this fucker looked like.

468
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,392
Check this out.

469
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,058
Dracula's only one
of the names he's gone by.

470
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:49,435
The Babylonians worshipped him
as Dagon, and now they call him Drake.

471
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,873
If you believe in the legends,
he was born in ancient Sumeria.

472
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:05,421
Nobody really knows the specifics
of his origin, but we do know this.

473
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:10,959
He was the first of his kind.

474
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,624
The patriarch of <i>hominus nocturna.</i>

475
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,506
He was born perfect.

476
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:31,436
And just like the great white shark,
this guy has never had to evolve.

477
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,642
Forget the movies, forget the books.

478
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:35,412
There's no happy ending with this guy.

479
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,182
He's been there,
moving behind the scenes,

480
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:44,717
cutting a bloody fucking path
through the ages, until suddenly...

481
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,290
...just like that...

482
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,300
...he up and disappeared.

483
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,032
And then we heard a rumor.

484
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:58,267
The vampires were searching for him.

485
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,776
Some say he'd been sleeping
through the ages,

486
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,938
that he'd retreated from a world
he'd become disgusted with.

487
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:08,212
And according to our information, they
found him in Iraq about six months ago.

488
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,082
And he was pissed.

489
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:38,277
Don't try to use my name,
that's fatal

490
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:41,044
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

491
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:44,246
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

492
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,256
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

493
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:50,157
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

494
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:53,719
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

495
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,474
In the window...

496
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,912
You sell vampire merchandise?

497
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,445
Uh, yeah.

498
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,952
Look around.

499
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,647
We might have a few things.

500
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,286
We've got Dracula lunchboxes.

501
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,725
Did you see those?

502
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,390
There's bobble heads, key chains.

503
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,523
This is funny.

504
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,201
<i>That garlic gets me every time.</i>

505
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,905
We've got just about anything.

506
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,811
Even vampire vibrators.

507
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,778
Here. Check this out.

508
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:51,952
Dra-cola.

509
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,550
Makes you want to cry, doesn't it?

510
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,666
Was there something special
you needed?

511
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,630
Hey, guy.

512
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,996
She's talkin' to ya.

513
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,273
What?

514
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:22,284
You wanna kiss me, pretty boy?

515
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,820
Aah!

516
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,014
No!

517
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,216
Tried to claim my fame,
but that's fatal

518
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:31,556
About to raise the pain,
that's fatal

519
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,858
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

520
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:39,061
Aah!

521
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:42,501
Aah!

522
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,247
Bite through your jugular vein,
that's fatal

523
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,042
Why wake up Drake now?

524
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,211
That's exactly what we've been
trying to figure out.

525
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,618
When I was under the fang,

526
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:02,681
there used to be talk about
some kind of vampire final solution.

527
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,750
But I could never figure out why
they'd want to destroy their food source.

528
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,762
I mean, that makes no sense, right?

529
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,457
They've always had plans
for the human race,

530
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:11,000
and it seems likely
that whatever they're cooking up,

531
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,865
Drake's return is part of it.

532
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:13,925
Let's face it.

533
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,097
We are fighting a losing battle here.

534
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,698
So we kill a few hundred
of them a year... big deal.

535
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,767
There are thousands of them out there,
maybe tens of thousands.

536
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:23,039
We need a new tactic.

537
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:24,307
Like what?

538
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,871
A biological weapon.

539
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,041
For you sighted people...

540
00:51:31,688 --> 00:51:33,781
...here's a little show and tell.

541
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,382
For the last year,
I've been working with synthesized DNA

542
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:40,453
in order to create an artificial virus
targeted specifically at vampires.

543
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,623
We're calling it DayStar.

544
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,257
Think about it, Blade.

545
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:47,528
We could wipe 'em all out
in one single move.

546
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,299
So what's been holding you back?

547
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,738
The lethality in vampires is still spotty.

548
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,936
The bottom line is we need
a better strand of DNA to work with.

549
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,837
We need Dracula's blood.

550
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,508
Because Dracula is the progenitor
of the vampire race,

551
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,984
his DNA is still pure.

552
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:07,683
It hasn't been diluted by a hundred
generations of selective mutation.

553
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:13,559
We get his blood, we can boost
DayStar's viral efficacy to 100%.

554
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:15,791
All the vampires go bye-bye.

555
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,969
So, can we just
go right ahead and sign you up

556
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:22,300
for one of our secret
Nightstalker decoder rings?

557
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,236
Oh.

558
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,677
Holy shit.

559
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,477
Um, gentlemen and hottie,

560
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:36,383
uh, we have a wide assortment
of ass-kickery

561
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,444
for your viewing pleasure today.

562
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:42,253
Electronic pistol... comes in a variety
of tasty calibers.

563
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:44,659
Explosive rounds.

564
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,889
Yeah, but with
a concentrated burst of UV light

565
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,931
instead of your standard hollow points.

566
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,728
I call 'em sun dogs.

567
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,997
Hedges. Super-size me, sweetheart.

568
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,873
This little pea shooter...
it's a modified version

569
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,672
of the Army's objective
individual combat weapon.

570
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:03,474
Pick your poison... sun dogs, stakes,

571
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,071
heat-seeking mini rockets.

572
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:08,481
Basically, whatever gets you hard,
this puppy'll pump 'em out.

573
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,521
Course, it doesn't have
the range of a sword, but...

574
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,315
Oh, God.

575
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,791
Over here, we, um...

576
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,557
we call this the UV Arc.

577
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,791
Whoa. Sorry.

578
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,733
The two points are connected
by a powerful UV laser...

579
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:27,827
- Hedges, I'll take it from here.
- Yes.

580
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,067
This bad boy is half as hot as the sun.

581
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:34,474
It can cut through vampires
like a knife through butter.

582
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,877
We're still trying to sort out fact
from fiction when it comes to Dracula.

583
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,280
Turning into mist?
Kinda doubt it.

584
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,842
General shape-shifting?
Maybe.

585
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:47,148
Not into a bat or a wolf
or anything like that,

586
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:51,160
but another human,
with practice, could be possible.

587
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,690
Because he wouldn't have
a traditional skeletal structure.

588
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:58,029
Something more like a snake's,
with thousands of tiny bones...

589
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:01,593
I have a... I have a question
about that, Hedges.

590
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:03,502
Have you ever been laid?

591
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,070
Many times.

592
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:07,234
With ladies.

593
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,703
Time for a little pressure.

594
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,110
The weakest link
in the vampire chain of command

595
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,243
has always been their familiars.

596
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,583
Since the vampires can't go out
in the daylight,

597
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,488
they get the humans to do
all their dirty work.

598
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,423
We bleed the wannabes...

599
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,357
Sooner or later,
they'll take us right to the real.

600
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,658
I got you some new wheels.

601
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,165
You take care of it now.

602
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,605
She's making playlists.

603
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,535
She likes to listen to MP3s
when she hunts.

604
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,011
It's like her own
internal soundtrack, you know?

605
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:48,107
Dark core, trip hop, whatever
kids are listening to these days.

606
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,651
Me, I'm more of
a David Hasselhoff fan, you know?

607
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,754
Come on, come on
like that, ya'll

608
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,888
Come on, come on,
like that, y'all

609
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,932
Let me see you say ho

610
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,815
Let me see you say ho

611
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:35,629
Aah!

612
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,433
Ah! Aah!

613
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,735
Eventually, you know,
your head is gonna pop off.

614
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,111
Fuck! No, no!
Please, please! Please.

615
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,410
Who's your handler?

616
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,041
I don't know my fucking handler.

617
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:56,847
I swear. I swear!

618
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,150
Oh, shit! Please! Please!

619
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,451
Oh, it's <i>you.</i>

620
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,254
I'll take that.

621
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,087
Come on!

622
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:10,655
Let's go! Come on!

623
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:15,929
<i>Hello?</i>

624
00:56:16,005 --> 00:56:17,131
<i>Hello?</i>

625
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,176
Hello, this is Dr. Vance.
You paged me.

626
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:23,601
It's for you.

627
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,045
Yeah, go ahead.

628
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,309
Hello?

629
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,750
Aah!

630
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,282
You know, at some point, you, uh,

631
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:34,721
you might want to consider
sitting down with somebody.

632
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,759
You know? Have a little share time?

633
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:39,158
Kick back?
Get in touch with your inner child?

634
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,253
That sort of thing?

635
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,824
Also... just a thought... but you might
wanna consider blinking once in a while.

636
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,866
I'm sorry, I, uh,
I ate a lot of sugar today.

637
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,183
Hey.

638
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,526
You just can't walk in here like... aah!

639
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:23,499
Excuse me, sir.

640
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:31,941
Don't do that.

641
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:50,755
Where's Vance?

642
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,927
I'm sorry, but you can't see
Dr. Vance right now.

643
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,271
Sit.

644
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,482
Can I, uh, can I help you?

645
00:58:09,552 --> 00:58:11,679
Remember me?
Time for payback.

646
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:14,086
All right, Vance,
what the hell do you know?

647
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:17,817
Oh, Jesus.

648
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,088
It's him.

649
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,891
Abby. It's Drake!

650
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,231
Aah!

651
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:39,107
So, you're the hunter they all fear.

652
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,706
I had a feeling about you.

653
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:41,977
Just shoot him!

654
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,678
Go ahead, Blade.

655
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:45,084
Show me what you're made of.

656
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,212
Aah!
