00:55:43,823 --> 00:55:44,881
You okay?

635
00:55:58,338 --> 00:56:00,329
Stop crying.

636
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,000
Grab a foot
and help me get her off the road.

637
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:06,770
Now.

Help me hide her.

That doesn't matter.

642
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:02,720
They'll send you to jail
just for helping me hide her.

643
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,730
I had to kill her
because she was going to tell on me.

644
00:58:08,268 --> 00:58:13,228
You're not going to tell on me.
Are you?

645
00:58:22,615 --> 00:58:23,912
Don't worry.

646
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,244
You're my little sister.

647
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,547
I won't let anything happen to you.

I love you.

649
00:59:41,761 --> 00:59:43,991
Tell me what you saw.

00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:46,961
-What are you doing?
-What did you see?

651
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:49,294
I saw you and Max in the tree house.

What else?

-What do you mean?
-What else did you see?

654
00:59:53,539 --> 00:59:55,200
I didn't see anything. I swear.

655
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:57,309
-Did you tell anyone?
-No.

656
00:59:58,144 --> 00:59:59,475
I didn't tell anyone.

01:00:01,147 --> 01:00:02,307
Please....

658
01:00:02,482 --> 01:00:06,543
If I find out that you're lying,
I'll cut your hairless little prick off...

01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:09,517
...before you even figure out
what it's for.

-Do you understand me?
-Yes.

661

You pissed yourself.

662
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:32,743
It was nice talking to you, Alice.
I hope we can be friends.

663

I'd like that.

-We'll be right out, honey.
-You can come on in.

01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:49,384
My initial instinct is that...

666
01:00:49,561 --> 01:00:53,361
...there's not a deeply-rooted problem
in Esther's past.

667
01:00:54,066 --> 01:00:58,093
-So there's nothing wrong with her?
-No.

668
01:01:01,273 --> 01:01:04,140
It's not all good news.
I think what needs to be examined...

669
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:07,870
...is Esther's relationship
with those around her.
