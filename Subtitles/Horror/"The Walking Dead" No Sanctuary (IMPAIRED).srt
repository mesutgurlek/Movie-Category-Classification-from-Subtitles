I love you, Lizzie.

You don't need to stay.

7
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:14,816
We can't stay.

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,541

9
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:20,198
Welcome to Terminus!

10

18
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:55,040
We brought them here.

19
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:01,931
We were trying
to do something good.

20
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:05,507

21

Y'all know what to do.

44

Go for their eyes first.

Then their throats.

46

Crap, man, I'm sorry.

63
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:54,910

Kaylee won't be gathering
them until tomorrow.

68
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:03,883
Hey, let me talk to you.

69
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:07,988
Four from A, four from D?

Man:
<i>Yeah.</i>

71
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,260
Hey, let me talk
to you for a minute.

72
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:13,593
Let me talk to you for a minute.

73
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,528
- Let me talk to you for a minute.
- What?

74
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,898
Don't do this.
We can fix this.

75
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,735
- No, you can't.
- You don't have to do this.

76
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:22,339
We told you there's a way
out of all this.

77
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,642
You just have to take a chance.

78
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,915
We have a man
who knows how to stop it.

79
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:33,182
He has a cure. We just have
to get him to Washington.

80
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,951
You don't have to do this, man.

81
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:37,052
We can put the world
back to how it was.

82
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:40,389
Can't go back, Bob.

83
00:06:40,391 --> 00:06:42,424
We can!
You don't have to do this!

84
00:06:56,606 --> 00:06:59,371
We saw you go into
the woods with a bag

85
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:01,541
and come out without it.

86
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:04,413
Had to pull my spotters back
before we could go look for it.

87
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,513
What was in it?

88
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:11,615
You hid it, right?

89
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:14,118
In case things went bad?

90
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:18,391
Smart.

91
00:07:18,393 --> 00:07:20,326
Still, we'll find it.

92
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:22,396
But it's too dangerous
to go out there right now.

93
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,074
What was in it?

94
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:34,944
I'm curious.

95
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:38,682
And it was a big bag.

96
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:45,055
You really gonna let me do this?

97
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:47,158
Well, let me take you out there.

98
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,562
I'll show you.

99
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,433
Not gonna happen.
This might.

100
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:54,368
Rick:
<i>There's guns in it.</i>

Automatic weapons.
Nightscope.

104
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,550
There's a compound bow

105
00:08:07,552 --> 00:08:10,755
and a machete with a red handle.

106
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,623
That's what I'm gonna
use to kill you.

You have two hours

I'm gonna go back

112

Now's the time we can get messy,

113
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,474
but we need to dial
it all in by sundown.

114

201
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:49,283

Been behind some kind
