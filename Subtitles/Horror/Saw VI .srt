Help!

00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,086
Eddie!

5
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,317
What the hel....

6
00:01:45,318 --> 00:01:47,127
Eddie, wake up!

7
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,557
Don't move.

8
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:52,162
Okay, listen to me. Don't lean forward.

9
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:53,811
-What's going on?
-No!

<i> Hello. </i>

11
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:05,739
<i>I want to play a game</i>

12
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:09,193
<i>The devices on your
heads are symbolic</i>

13
00:02:09,194 --> 00:02:11,797
<i>of the shackles you
place upon others</i>

14
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,717
<i>You recklessly
loan people money</i>

15
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:16,196
<i>knowing their
financial limitations</i>

16
00:02:16,197 --> 00:02:18,199
<i>Counting on
repossessing more than</i>

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,567
<i>they could ever pay back</i>

18
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:23,141
<i>You are predators</i>

19
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,542
<i>Well today, you become the prey</i>

20
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:27,403
<i>and you will give the amount
of flesh that I demand</i>

21
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:29,806
This is your fault!

22
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:32,968
<i>The scale before you is your
only path to freedom</i>

23
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:36,489
<i>However, only
one of you may pass</i>

24
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,326
<i>and the toll is the
ultimate sacrifice</i>

25
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,125
<i>The sacrifice of flesh</i>

26
00:02:43,126 --> 00:02:46,880
<i>Before you are the
instruments to exact this flesh</i>

27
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:51,772
<i>Move with haste now,
for when the 60 second timer hits zero</i>

28
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:56,941
<i>the one who has given
the most flesh will release their bindings</i>

29
00:02:56,942 --> 00:03:01,593
<i>while the gears on your opponent's
head will engage,piercing their skull</i>

30
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:05,808
<i>Who will offer the most flesh
in order to save their life?</i>

31
00:03:05,809 --> 00:03:08,215
<i>The choice is yours</i>

32
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:22,194
I will not die because of you, bitch!

<i>I ask you, Special Agent Strahm</i>

35
00:05:46,832 --> 00:05:48,688
<i>have you learned enough to trust me?</i>

36
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:52,190
<i>However, if you choose not to</i>

37
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:54,121
<i>you will never be heard from again.</i>

38
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:56,330
<i>Your body will never be found.</i>

39
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:59,394

00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:27,796
Hey,baby

42
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,564
Well, listen, I am so,
so sorry.

43
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:33,100
but I can't make dinner

44
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:35,277
I have to work late.

45
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:37,197
I have a meeting with
my lawyer

46
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:40,189
and this will keep me busy
for the rest of the afternoon.

47
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:46,805
I know it's your birthday,and I'm going to
make it up to you. I promise.

48
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:51,829
love you.

49
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:57,572
-Uh, what were we talking about?
-We're talking about your deposition.

50
00:07:57,573 --> 00:08:01,250
So worried about me, Debbie

51
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:03,277
Some small-time lawyer trying to squeeze us is not
going to get me to say anything I don't want to say.

52
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,713
I have no doubt about that,
but as lead counsel for this company

53
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:08,195
if you screw up,
it comes down on my ass,so

54
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:10,337
what do you say we prep your deposition?

55
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:14,039
-Oh, Christ.
-Do you remember dealing with a Mr. Harold Abbot?

56
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,288
William, I have a Casey Patterson
on Line One.

57
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,252
Take another message, Addy,
I'll get back to her this week.

58
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:22,427
Sometime... Keep going

59
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:25,465
When opposing counsel asks about
Mr. Abbot, how will you respond?

60
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:29,015
I am going to respond by saying, as Senior
Vice-President of Membership and Claims.

61
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:30,908
it is my job to review.

62
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:32,600
every terminated policy

63
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:35,695
As a matter of fact, Mr. Abbot
was sitting right where you are now

64
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:37,481
when we discussed his appeal.

65
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:41,063
I... I just don't get it.

66
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:44,066
I've been with this insurance
company for over 10 years.

67
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,401
I know, Harold, but unfortunately,
when we reviewed your claim.

68
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,767
we discovered that you failed
to mention a previous condition.

69
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:52,212
What condition?
There's no condition

70
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:57,637
It says here you had oral surgery
to remove a cyst from your jaw.

71
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,269
This is absurd!
I have heart disease

72
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,517
It has nothing to do with some oral surgery

73
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:03,150
- that I had 30 years ago!
- Any type of oral surgery

74
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:05,270
is going to leave scar tissue

75
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:07,959
Scar tissue can lead to gum disease

76
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,458
and as you well know,
gum disease can cause heart disease.
.

77
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:14,124
You know what?
You're-You're a criminal

78
00:09:14,711 --> 00:09:18,119
You are goddamn criminal

79
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,984
I've paid my monthly premium for
10 years without so much as a cold

80
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:25,565
and now that I'm actually sick,
you're gonna deny my coverage?

81
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,084
- I have a family!
- Those are the rules, Harold!

82
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:31,493
I'm sorry, but your own
actions have caused this.

83
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:36,737
You've just given me a death sentence,
I mean, who's gonna cover me now?

84
00:09:37,676 --> 00:09:39,927
You just killed me

85
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:44,798
I have a family too, so
I can empathize with his argument

86
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:47,286
But basically, the guy lied
on his application

87
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,420
- Whoa, watch it, Will.
- What?

88
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,412
Do you think he did that on purpose?

89
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:57,823
It wasn't my job to assess
what his intentions were

90
00:09:57,824 --> 00:10:00,431
It was my job to check
the accuracy of his claim.

91
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:01,779
Everybody thinks we're the bad guys.
Nobody mentions

92
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,564
the millions of people we help
every year without incident

93
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:06,841
Or the millions of dollars

94
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,531
we donate to charity every year

95
00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:10,805
Or all the free clinics we support

96
00:10:10,806 --> 00:10:13,515
Short answers, Will.
Short answers.

97
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:16,108
<i>The assets for one of history's
most notorious serial killers</i>

98
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,223
<i>John Kramer, were distributed</i>

99
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:20,923
<i>They were mainly in
real estate holdings</i>

100
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:22,396
<i>but in my time...</i>

101
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:25,004
One more question:
Who found the error on his application?

102
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:30,472
The Dog Pen. They work as a team

103
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:32,298
If there's a discrepancy to be
found on an application,

104
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,567
the six of them will find it.

105
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,548
- Lord, are waiting in the conference room.
- very good.

106
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,091
How is going today people?

107
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:47,026
I found two errors in the application for a client.
This practice had now been closed for some time.

108
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:52,688
- Terminator strikes again!
- Be back in a few hours.

109
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,535

00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:16,779
Yeah

113
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,578
I'm on my way

114
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:34,889
- What's going on?
- Feds took over the crime scene

115
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,029
They're requesting you ASAP.

116
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:50,353
Erickson!

117
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:53,261
I didn't know you ever made
it out from behind the desk.

I make exceptions when fingerprints
are found at a Jigsaw murder scene

119
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:00,815
Have a look

120
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:05,622
We also got a right index off the scale.

121
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:08,332
- Been IDed yet?
- Yeah.

122
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:11,358
They're Agent Strahm's

123
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:14,221
When I learned he and Perez
were being targeted by Jigsaw

124
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:18,508
I should have been more aware,
but I didn't see this coming

125
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:21,546
-Not from Peter Strahm
-It was a shock to all of us.

126
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:25,089
Yeah, But...

127
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:28,087
we've got something
he doesn't know about

128
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:31,005
Follow me.

129
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,653
Lindsey.

130
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,095
Detective Hoffman

131
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,432
Perez?

132
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:52,301
It was my call, Detective.
I knew that Jigsaw wasn't working alone

133
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:54,606
but until I knew for certain
who was helping him

134
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,399
I couldn't guarantee her well-being

135
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,415
So you let me think she was
dead?

136
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,361
Well, I did not know
who I could trust.

137
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:04,810
What else have you been
keeping from me?

138
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:07,857
We know that Agent Strahm knew
the 5 people in the real estate scam

139
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:10,383
The victims in the traps that Erickson found

140
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:13,433
- How do you know?
- Strahm and I investigated them after the house fire

141
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:16,180
It was arson.
All five people were accountable

142
00:13:16,181 --> 00:13:17,621
but after our lone witness went
missing,

143
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:19,937
no charges were ever filed.

144
00:13:20,303 --> 00:13:21,934
Strahm couldn't let them get away

145
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,131
so he put them in a trap in which slaughtering
each other was the only way out

146
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:26,930
So what are you telling me?
He's a vigilante?

147
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,764
Call him whatever you like.

148
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:30,541
But he has to be found.

149
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:36,429
We would like to work
together on this.

150
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:40,361
You led me to believe that she was dead,
and you want to work with me?

151
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,852
Look, we're offering full disclosure, detective

152
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:45,445
So from now on, everything
we know, you know

153
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:47,125
Is that fair?

154
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:57,711
Detective Hoffman.
How about a quick word?

155
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,762
Pamela Jenkins,
the resident Jigsaw sensation

156
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:04,073
- Just reporting the facts, detective.
- Is that what you're doing? John Kramer: Conundrums of Carnage

00:14:06,286 --> 00:14:09,266
If you'd like to make a statement on the record,
I'd be more than happy to take it.

158
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,379
You're twisting the facts to
make a better story

159
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,769
It's irresponsible

160
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:15,058
Excuse me. Nice catching on

161
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:17,743
I know more about John Kramer
than you might think

162
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,523
- Somehow I doubt that
- Kramer left his wife a box in his will

163
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:25,329
- Did you know that?
- Maybe I did, maybe I didn't

164
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,730
- How do you know it?
- Probate court

165
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,490
It's public record for those
who know where to look.

166
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:31,507
All right. What do you really want?

167
00:14:31,508 --> 00:14:33,367
Jill Tuck

168
00:14:33,368 --> 00:14:36,635
Help me get to her, and I will
dial down on the sensationalism

169
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:39,228
Really?

170
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:41,230
I'll see what I can do

171
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,062
I do not know how I got there.

172
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:58,423
I just opened my eyes ... e.

173
00:14:58,424 --> 00:14:59,780
He did this to me

174
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:02,851
Who did this?

175
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,195
Jigsaw.

176
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:06,808
You didn't cut your own arm off?

177
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:09,977
I did. I did.

178
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:11,509
But he made me do it.

179
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,814
And why is that?

180
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:17,694
Because what Eddie and
I were doing was wrong

181
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,767
We were ruining people's lives.

182
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,411
He wanted us to learn

183
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,327
And did you?

184
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:36,888
Look at me!

185
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:38,840
Look at my goddamn arm!

186
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:41,498
What the fuck am I supposed
to learn from this?! Huh?

187
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:43,690
Look at my arm!

188
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,635
What am I supposed to
learn from this?!

189
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:48,742
Look at me!

190
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:57,321
Hello Gideon!

191
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:12,048
<i> I'm sure I put here, somewhere. </ i></i>

192
00:16:12,049 --> 00:16:16,133
Look here.
This gives happiness to the family.

193
00:16:16,134 --> 00:16:19,652
We love you more than ourselves son.

194
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:34,467
<i>If you're watching this Jill</i>

195
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:37,367
<i>I'm long gone from this world.</i>

196
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,306
<i>I'm leaving you a box today,</i>

197
00:16:41,307 --> 00:16:44,213
<i>and its contents are of grave importance.</i>

198
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,031
<i> Now I'm not at home, but, please,
leave a message. </ i></i>

199
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:26,392
<i> Sig.na Tucker, are still
Pamela Jenkins. </ i></i>

200
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:29,321
<i> hoped it would clarify one thing
the relationship with her husband ... </i>

201
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,687
<i>Are you there, detective?
By hearing this tape</i>

202
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:40,726
<i>some will assume that this is over.</i>

203
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,472
<i>You feel you now have control,don't you?
You think you will walk away untested?</i>

204
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:50,049
<i> think to be able to get out before he risked his life? </ i></i>

205
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,286
Look here ...

206
00:17:56,287 --> 00:17:59,756
These are the Jigsaw pieces
carved from previous victims

207
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:04,820
This is the piece taken from
the latest victim

208
00:18:04,821 --> 00:18:08,733
-It looks like all the rest
-Yeah, that's what we said, too.

209
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:13,261
The skin abrasions, they're indicative of a knife
of a partially serrated edge.

210
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:17,191
So?

211
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:20,543
So all the other cuts were made with
a near-perfect blade of surgical quality.

212
00:18:23,473 --> 00:18:25,885
Obviously, Strahm used a different
knife than John Kramer.

213
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:29,234
Right, but it got us curious,
so we pulled the files to compare

214
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:32,595
That same knife was used
on only one other victim

215
00:18:32,596 --> 00:18:34,639
That victim was Seth Baxter

216
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:38,374
The man who killed your sister.

217
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,884
You're telling me that

218
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,189
you can tell a different knife
was used from a photo?

219
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,312
No, but I can

220
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:47,530
I was the one who examined that body.

221
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:49,791
I've examined every body of the Jigsaw Killer.

222
00:18:49,792 --> 00:18:51,381
Good work.

223
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:55,326
The tape from the latest victim was missing,
so we're looking into the Seth Baxter tape.

224
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:57,281
Why is that?

225
00:18:57,282 --> 00:19:01,483
Well, maybe if a different person cut the piece,
then maybe a different person made the tape, too.

226
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:05,231
- Strahm?
- Yeah, maybe.

227
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:08,042
Strahm's voice on the tape
would be our smoking gun.

228
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:11,579
We have that, we could
go public with his involvement.

229
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,341
Jane , Jane, it's allright , ok?
take it easy

230
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,717
I didn't expect to
see you here so soon.

231
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:51,240
Change of plans.

232
00:19:52,814 --> 00:19:53,854
The game begins tonight.

233
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:56,222
Why?

234
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:58,999
Because somebody knows
about the box that shouldn't.

235
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:00,587
- Who?
-That's not your concern.

236
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:02,928
All you need to know is
that:from now on

237
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:05,158
I control all aspects of the game.

238
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,859
That's not what John wanted.

239
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,127
Give me the envelopes.
That's not a request.

240
00:20:22,134 --> 00:20:23,450
Here.

241
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:27,212
That all there is?

242
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:31,108
- Yes
- From now on, I work alone.

243
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,108
I know

244
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:36,161
I'm only carrying out John's final request.

245
00:20:36,162 --> 00:20:39,750
Well, John's dead.
And his work is almost done

246
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:46,282
- Who's this?
- Unfinished business.

247
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:54,342
When I'm done,
we no longer speak.

248
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:12,869
Methadone is only a masking agent.
It doesn't heal; it just simply numbs the senses

249
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,468
I found a better way.

250
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,052
These people,
they will continue to hurt you,

251
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:24,123
and let you down.

252
00:21:24,124 --> 00:21:26,206
They're addicts, John.
Recovery is a process.

253
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:29,121
Maybe addiction is just
a part of human nature.

254
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:32,899
But what about these people,
Jill, who come here every day

255
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,131
and use you?
They bide their time

256
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:38,957
They're avoiding prison sentences

257
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:42,891
They're getting hooked on masking agents,
Do you call that recovery?

258
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:46,992
- It's not that simple.
- Addiction is not simple! JILL!

259
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:50,246
WAKE UP!

260
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:55,414
These people have no respect
for the lives that they're destroying

261
00:21:55,737 --> 00:22:00,365
Once you see death up close,
then you know what the value of life is

262
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:05,472
the value of life,do you know that?

263
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:14,332
And that's my way. And I
brought proof that I want you to see.

264
00:22:21,398 --> 00:22:24,407
- Amanda?
- Hello, Jill.

265
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,111
Jill, you once told me that she
was a lost soul

266
00:22:36,026 --> 00:22:38,060
But here she stands

267
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:43,055
She's clean, and whole.

268
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:49,341
- And she has new appreciation for her life.
- It works

269
00:22:49,908 --> 00:22:53,226
It's real. He helped me.

270
00:23:03,681 --> 00:23:04,888
Okay, John.

271
00:23:20,517 --> 00:23:23,666
<i> Do you know police , what had you believe?
John Kramer (Jigsaw) has dead.</i>

272
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:28,090
<i> prorpio last week claimed to have discovered
a new game with terrible implications. </ i></i>

273
00:23:28,202 --> 00:23:31,938
<i> the victims are all connected
the life of John Kramer ...</ i></i>

274
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:37,582
<i> Jigsaw [killer] that may be dead,
But the murders continue. </ i></i>

275
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,743
Fuck!

276
00:23:51,578 --> 00:23:52,901
Hank, are you still here?

277
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:26,490
Don't fucking move!

278
00:24:34,194 --> 00:24:35,621
Oh... shit!

279
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:38,724
O God!
Someone will take care of you.

280
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:41,104
Where is the key?
And in the left pocket?

281
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:20,864
Hello, William.

282
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:22,439
Oh, Jesus--

283
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:25,771
You've probably been wondering
when we would see each other again.

284
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,338
- Today is that day.
- No!

285
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:33,202
For years, your probability formula
has decided the fate of others.

286
00:25:34,206 --> 00:25:38,240
The healthy have benefited while
the potentially sick have been unjustly rejected.

287
00:25:39,185 --> 00:25:43,585
However, this formula does not take
into account the human will to live.

288
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:48,068
When faced with death,
who should live versus who will live

289
00:25:48,443 --> 00:25:50,547
are two entirely separate things.

290
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,998
Today, your policy
will be put to the test

291
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:58,068
There are four straps around your limbs
and you have four tests you must complete.

292
00:25:58,884 --> 00:26:03,650
For if you don't, the straps on your arms
and legs will detonate

293
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:07,376
Look closely.

294
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:16,253
You have 60 minutes to complete
your tests and avoid this fate.

295
00:26:16,254 --> 00:26:17,606
Starting now.

296
00:26:18,612 --> 00:26:21,085
You are not alone in this game,Just as you
have taken loved ones away from their families

297
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:30,428
if you don't reach the end before the timer hits zero,
you will never see your family again.

298
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:34,079
Mom?
Mom!

299
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,531
Wake up,Mom!

300
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:36,624
Mom?

301
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:41,636
Where are we?

302
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:43,939
I don't know

303
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:45,764
- What's that?
- I don't know.

304
00:26:46,197 --> 00:26:48,658
Look ...

305
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,479
Oh, my God!

306
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:58,232
Here is your first test.

307
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:03,633
Your health and military background puts
you in the highest category of success.

308
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:09,174
However, the same cannot be
said for your adversary.

309
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:14,441
At only 52 years of age, this man has continued to smoke even
though he has a history of high blood pressure and heart disease

310
00:27:19,164 --> 00:27:23,865
This demonstrates his appreciation
of the blessings of his own life

311
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:29,012
Your game will focus on a simple element.

312
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:32,641
From there, once this game begins,
every time you take a breath,

313
00:27:32,997 --> 00:27:37,260
the clamps around your chest
will close in and crush your body.

314
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:40,676
The only way to escape is in the other's failure.

315
00:27:40,712 --> 00:27:44,729
So I ask you, when faced with death,
who will survive?

316
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,235
Live or die, William.

317
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:49,521
Make your choice.

318
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:52,863
- Fuck you!!
- Who the hell is that?!

319
00:27:59,086 --> 00:28:00,155
Hold your breath!

320
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:47,432
Fuck you!

321
00:29:47,773 --> 00:29:49,303
Jesus Christ!

322
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:22,184
Come on! Come on!

323
00:30:30,783 --> 00:30:31,563
Shit

324
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:44,045
Please help us!

325
00:30:44,372 --> 00:30:47,435
Please!
Help!

326
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,822
Someone help us!

327
00:30:49,823 --> 00:30:51,591
Please!

328
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:54,552
Help!
anybody!

329
00:30:55,131 --> 00:30:57,730
"Live" ?  "Die" ?
What the fuck?

330
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:02,548
Connected to that thing.

331
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:12,479
- HF , What is that?
- Hydrofluoric acid.

332
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,436
This substance can corrode the flesh
in seconds.

333
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:21,139
- What do we do?
- I do not know.

334
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,431
you want live , dont you?

335
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:26,760
What about the timer?
Must mean something.

336
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:30,278
I have no idea. I do not know
why we are here.

337
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:35,632
We are here because of your father.

338
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:21,369
- Ms. Jenkins
- Please, this will only take a second

339
00:32:21,864 --> 00:32:22,842
We can help each other.

340
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:24,983
What makes you think you can
come to my door like this?

341
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,122
Because I found something
you'll want to see

342
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,072
Go on.

343
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:35,863
Where did you get this?

344
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:37,867
It was at the location where John died.

345
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:39,917
Does it mean anything to you?

346
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:41,518
No.

347
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,156
Goodbye, Ms. Jenkins.

348
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:48,963
If you think of anything.

349
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:49,561
I want to thank you for
sponsoring this party, William,

350
00:33:49,562 --> 00:33:52,080
And I know how much the clinic appreciates it.

351
00:33:53,123 --> 00:33:54,128
John Kramer.

352
00:33:56,024 --> 00:33:57,086
William Easton. Kramer.
You're Jill's husband, right?

353
00:33:57,098 --> 00:33:58,705
- I am.
- Nice to meet you.

354
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,147
Nice to meet you.

355
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,979
Sounds like we're in
a similar business, John.

356
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,927
Oh, yeah? How's that?

357
00:34:03,928 --> 00:34:06,628
Well, you try to predict people's behavior.
So do I.

358
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:10,095
People count on us for coverage,

359
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,711
and we have to analyze each person
for the probability of success.

360
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:17,249
- How do you do that?
- Well, it's a formula.

361
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,250
It's pretty complicated, actually,
but in essence

362
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:23,121
it breaks down to monthly payments
multiplied by lifespan,

363
00:34:23,122 --> 00:34:26,273
minus the probability of illness,

364
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:28,441
and if its sum is positive,
we consider coverage.

365
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:32,895
- Who devised that formula?
- Me.

366
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:37,934
So, in a sense...
you choose who lives or dies?

367
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:43,993
No, I, uh... No, I'd say I decide
which people have the potential

368
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,961
to live long, healthy lives.

369
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:49,920
But you're not taking into onsideration
the most important human element of all.

370
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,783
Which is what?

371
00:34:51,784 --> 00:34:53,342
The will to live.

372
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:59,613
Until a person is faced with death,
it's impossible to tell

373
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:01,645
whether the have what it takes to survive.

374
00:35:51,824 --> 00:35:53,043
Fuck that!

375
00:35:55,877 --> 00:35:56,804
Shit!

376
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:21,985
Hello, William.

377
00:36:21,986 --> 00:36:26,222
Standing on the platforms behind me
are two of your colleagues.

378
00:36:26,423 --> 00:36:28,467
One is your file clerk:

379
00:36:28,582 --> 00:36:31,211
A healthy man with no relatives or relations.

380
00:36:32,535 --> 00:36:37,516
The other, a middle-aged woman
with a family history of diabetes.

381
00:36:37,983 --> 00:36:45,543
According to your policy, your secretary is older
and weaker and,therefore, less worthy to survive.

382
00:36:46,129 --> 00:36:50,335
But you know the loss that
she will be to her family,

383
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,208
while young Allen will disappear
without a blip on the world's radar.

384
00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:00,821
Only one can exit this room,
and the choice of whom falls upon you.

385
00:37:01,718 --> 00:37:06,414
You must let go of the one to
save the life of the other.

386
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:08,693
As you can see, the choice is not so clear
when you're face-to-face with

387
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:12,164
the people whose blood will stain your hands.

388
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,195
Let the game begin.

389
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,737
Wait! Wait!

390
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:22,667
No! I won't do it! I won't do this!
I won't do this!

391
00:37:27,709 --> 00:37:28,607
Help me!!

392
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,571
It's a business!

393
00:37:35,142 --> 00:37:37,008
No! I'm not going to do it!
I'm not going to do it!

394
00:37:40,062 --> 00:37:42,732
I'm not going to do it!

395
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:43,790
-Stop it!!

396
00:37:49,638 --> 00:37:52,623
-Help me...please..

397
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,138
S..Stop it...

398
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:15,344
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

399
00:38:58,264 --> 00:39:00,201
Thank you. Thank you!

400
00:39:07,192 --> 00:39:09,458
You try and find a way out of here, Addy.

401
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:12,393
I have to keep going. Be careful.

402
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:44,555
Why not throw acid on the bars
iron corrode?

403
00:39:44,596 --> 00:39:46,305
With what they threw it on the bars?

404
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:48,478
With your hands?

405
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:53,049
What are you looking at?

406
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,260
Thought ...
Look at that mirror.

407
00:39:57,797 --> 00:39:59,121
What?

408
00:39:59,928 --> 00:40:01,892
Somebody's watching from behind the glass.

409
00:40:03,995 --> 00:40:06,197
What do you want?

410
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:10,580
Why are you doing this?

411
00:40:12,387 --> 00:40:15,847
Somebody help me, please.
Please help me.

412
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:32,180
<i> Hello, Pamela. </i>

413
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:34,483
<i>You've sensationalized my life,
twisting the truth</i>

414
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:38,487
<i>and exploiting my message
for your benefit</i>

415
00:41:03,249 --> 00:41:04,293
Hoffman.

416
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:08,195
<i>It's Erickson.
We found the Seth Baxter tape. </i>

417
00:41:08,671 --> 00:41:09,718
Yeah?

418
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:12,446
But there was something else
we wanted to discuss with you.

419
00:41:12,447 --> 00:41:15,559
- What's that?
- Better to talk about it in person.

420
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,685
- It's, uh, time sensitive.
- I'll be right there.

421
00:42:05,663 --> 00:42:09,340
The device Timothy is strapped
to is my personal favorite.

422
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:11,545
I call it The Rack.

423
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,423
Last-minute tweaks?
Told you he'd fuck with it.

424
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,482
If you switch the gear ratio,

425
00:42:27,483 --> 00:42:30,014
you have to change the gear
grease to match the increased friction.

426
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:33,875
Maybe you should stick to the heavy lifting.

427
00:42:35,174 --> 00:42:38,678
You will need this [gun] .

428
00:42:40,506 --> 00:42:42,169
Check with me next time.

429
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:44,452
How many next times are there gonna be?

430
00:42:44,453 --> 00:42:47,130
However many there needs to be.

431
00:42:56,227 --> 00:42:58,396
That's a human being.

432
00:43:01,608 --> 00:43:04,222
Do you like how brutality feels, Mark?

433
00:43:04,223 --> 00:43:05,531
Let's be honest.

434
00:43:06,186 --> 00:43:08,813
You want him to suffer
just as much as I do.

435
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:34,685
- So when's your test, detective?
- I don't need one.

436
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,236
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

437
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:41,280
Because I don't take life for granted.

438
00:43:41,281 --> 00:43:44,674
You're still dragging
your knuckles on the ground.

439
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,577
What do you know about life?

440
00:43:51,022 --> 00:43:55,049
Get used to me,
cause I'm not going anywhere.

441
00:43:56,951 --> 00:43:59,391
You sure about that?

442
00:44:01,422 --> 00:44:03,230
Time is short.

443
00:44:08,386 --> 00:44:09,958
You okay?

444
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:15,888
Now it's time to get
Dr. Denlon from the hospital.

445
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:16,923
Ok.

446
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:20,130
I'll take you back.

447
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,879
Go.
I'll be quick.

448
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,867
- Why'd you come here?
- John.

449
00:45:00,276 --> 00:45:02,361
Please, stop.

450
00:45:02,362 --> 00:45:05,619
- Don't do this.
- I promise you

451
00:45:07,323 --> 00:45:09,115
when all this is done

452
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,893
I will provide a way out for you.

453
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:19,218
don't you that, time was now.

454
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:22,439
I have something for you.

455
00:45:35,865 --> 00:45:37,618
What is it?

456
00:45:40,024 --> 00:45:42,250
You will discover that in it's time ...

457
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:46,090
you know , what to do.

458
00:46:27,657 --> 00:46:28,706
final decision.

459
00:46:28,707 --> 00:46:31,443
I came to talk to you, Will,because

460
00:46:33,512 --> 00:46:36,896
I've found a treatment for my cancer
that I think holds a lot of promise,

461
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:39,521
but my requests for coverage

462
00:46:41,488 --> 00:46:43,347
have all been turned down.

463
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:46,440
So I was hoping that maybe
if I came and explained it to you,

464
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:49,062
that you might be able to get
that overturned for me.

465
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,959
Well, the buck starts here,
John,Fire away.

466
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,423
This is a doctor in Norway

467
00:47:00,424 --> 00:47:03,566
He's got a 30-40%
success rate with gene therapy

468
00:47:03,567 --> 00:47:06,618
He injects what he calls suicide genes

469
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:10,132
into cancerous tumor cells,

470
00:47:10,132 --> 00:47:13,764
then any inactive form of a toxic
drug is administered and it...

471
00:47:13,765 --> 00:47:16,508
Yes, I'm familiar with the therapy
you're talking about.

472
00:47:16,669 --> 00:47:19,511
Right.
And a new trial's starting.

473
00:47:19,577 --> 00:47:21,470
He's looking for new patients,

474
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,845
-and he seems to think that I'm the perfect candidate.
-John,

475
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:26,075
if your primary physician, Dr. Gordon,

476
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,778
thought you were a suitable candidate,
he would have pursued it.

477
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,013
Dr. Gordon is a specialist, you know.
He's making money on his specialty.

478
00:47:33,014 --> 00:47:37,302
He's not a thinker,I mean, the man has his hand on
the doorknob half the time that I'm there..

479
00:47:37,303 --> 00:47:38,707
I'm going to be straight with you.

480
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:41,130
At your age, and with
the development of your cancer,

481
00:47:41,131 --> 00:47:43,031
it's simply not feasible for your--

482
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:43,893
Wait, wait, wait.

483
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,152
What's unfeasible?

484
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:49,550
By whose mathematical
equation is this not feasible?

485
00:47:49,551 --> 00:47:51,036
It's policy, John.

486
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:53,396
It's policy.

487
00:47:53,694 --> 00:47:58,179
And if you go outside the system to seek out
this treatment, which has been deemed ineffective,

488
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,205
you will be in breach of policy
and dropped from coverage completely.

489
00:48:02,206 --> 00:48:04,827
I'm sorry.

490
00:48:15,677 --> 00:48:19,670
Did you know that in the Far East,
people pay their doctors when they're healthy.

491
00:48:19,671 --> 00:48:23,034
When they're sick,
they don't have to pay.

492
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:28,472
So basically,they end up
paying for what they want,

493
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:30,444
not what they don't want.

494
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,248
We've got it all ass-backwards, here.

495
00:48:36,256 --> 00:48:40,424
These politicians, they say the same thing,
over and over and over again.

496
00:48:40,425 --> 00:48:44,369
Healthcare decisions should be made
by doctors and their patients,

497
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:47,717
not by the government.
Oh, now I know they're not made by doctors

498
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:50,906
and their patients or the government.

499
00:48:52,234 --> 00:48:54,602
They're made by the fuckin' insurance companies.

500
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:58,769
Piranha.

501
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:00,482
John...

502
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,771
please. If you do this,
then you'll be on your own

503
00:49:04,772 --> 00:49:07,304
and the subsequent cost to
you will be staggering.

504
00:49:07,305 --> 00:49:10,775
Don't talk to me about money.
I have money.

505
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:13,908
This is about principle.

506
00:49:17,585 --> 00:49:20,911
You see, Will...
this is my life

507
00:49:20,961 --> 00:49:23,264
we're talkin' about.
You remember?

508
00:49:23,265 --> 00:49:25,675
What about Jill's life?
How's she going to be taken care of when you're gone?

509
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:27,496
You let me worry about Jill.

510
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:31,974
The type of cancer you have
is malignant and inoperable.

511
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:33,730
That rolled off your tongue real smooth.

512
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:36,515
Even if the treatment works,
the cancer will return eventually.

513
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:37,776
It's an unwinnable battle.

514
00:49:37,777 --> 00:49:39,387
That was even smoother.

515
00:49:40,188 --> 00:49:43,181
As a matter of fact,
that was downright slick.

516
00:49:44,553 --> 00:49:48,590
You think it's the living that will
have ultimate judgement over you,

517
00:49:48,591 --> 00:49:52,441
because the dead will
have no claim over your soul.

518
00:50:02,172 --> 00:50:04,282
but you may be mistaken.

519
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:29,538
<i>Hello, William</i>

520
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:32,537

00:50:32,538 --> 00:50:36,141

522

523

You're going to be okay!

528
00:50:59,464 --> 00:51:04,564

will she have the skills to live?</i>


531
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,151
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

532
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:19,944
Okay, listen!

533
00:51:19,945 --> 00:51:23,050
-What the fuck is this?  Get me the fuck out of here!
-Listen to me! Debbie! Hey!

534
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,787
Okay, you're gonna get through 
this maze as fast as you can

535
00:51:34,787 --> 00:51:37,241
Go. Go! Now!

536
00:51:39,325 --> 00:51:41,028
Come on! You can make it! 

537
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,006
You have to keep moving.

538
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:45,313
Will, this is madness.

539
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:49,889
Go ... Come on, 
you can do it to get out of here!

540
00:51:55,677 --> 00:51:57,897
Wait a minute,
I think I can help here.

541
00:52:04,795 --> 00:52:07,087
We must work concomitantly!

542
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:09,331
We must work concomitantly to succeed!

543
00:52:09,332 --> 00:52:11,098
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

544
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,552
Go!

545
00:52:25,552 --> 00:52:27,465
Keep moving, do not stop!

546
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:29,883
Come on!  , Go! Go! Go!

547
00:52:43,866 --> 00:52:46,113
I can not! It's a fucking trap!
There is no way out.

548
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:51,352
It's a fucking trap.
I can not get out!

549
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:56,568
No!
No, there is a ladder at the end!

550
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:58,465
If you get there, be able to help.

551
00:53:00,972 --> 00:53:01,972
Are you ready?

552
00:53:04,456 --> 00:53:05,485
Go!

553
00:53:24,919 --> 00:53:26,692
Come on!

554
00:53:29,222 --> 00:53:29,907
Come on!

555
00:53:29,908 --> 00:53:31,203
Come on!
You're almost there.

556
00:53:31,204 --> 00:53:33,117
You're almost there.

557
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:36,236
Go! Go! Go!

558
00:53:36,742 --> 00:53:39,619
Search for a key, there should be a key.

559
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,439
Come on!

560
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:50,208
- What are you waiting for?
- It is inside you.

561
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:52,692
- What?
- Is within you!

562
00:53:53,393 --> 00:53:54,603
Shit.

563
00:53:57,413 --> 00:53:58,691
Ok.

564
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:03,036
Or wait ... Wait what are you doing?

565
00:54:23,346 --> 00:54:26,048
I can take it!
I can take it!

566
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:32,635
God, no!

567
00:54:57,451 --> 00:54:59,832
<i>Hello, Pamela. </i> 

568
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:04,900
<i>Well, today, you will experience 
the meaning of sacrifice and you </i>

569
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:09,347
<i>will see the consequence for those 
who unjustly hurt others. </i>

570
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:10,966
Fuck you!

571
00:55:30,833 --> 00:55:32,717
Someone's there. 

572
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:35,401
They're watching us. 

573
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,678
Why?

574
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:41,018 
Why would someone do this? 

575
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,563
Thanks for coming.

576
00:55:52,068 --> 00:55:52,911
What'd you find?

577
00:55:52,912 --> 00:55:54,688
- An abnormality with Strahm's fingerprints
- What?

578
00:55:54,689 --> 00:55:56,799
Take a look

579
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,897
See, the human fingerprint leaves an oily residue

580
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:02,966
Depending on how long it's been 
exposed to the elements

581
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:05,119
it's highly susceptible to contamination.

582
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,052
So what's the problem? 

583
00:56:06,053 --> 00:56:08,931
Well, we found trace amounts of Halomethane R-12.

584
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:11,279
She means Freon

585
00:56:11,346 --> 00:56:14,700
Production of R-12 ceased in 1994, so the question is, 

586
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:19,295
was the contaminant we found at the sight already, 
or did Strahm bring it to the facility with him?

587
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:22,207
We controllamo inside the 'edifício
before it was abandoned.

588
00:56:26,578 --> 00:56:28,792
Did anything come off of the Seth Baxter tape? 

589
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:31,877
Uh, yeah, actually. 
We might be on to something. 

590
00:56:31,878 --> 00:56:35,746
The tape was in pretty rough shape when 
we found it, but we were able to authenticate it.   

591
00:56:35,747 --> 00:56:39,278
The voice was intentionally distorted,
but it didn't match John Kramer's.

592
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,539
It's currently being analyzed. 

593
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,577
-Through what? 
-Well, we're trying to descramble the tape  

594
00:56:44,578 --> 00:56:46,320
to find the original voice.

595
00:56:46,321 --> 00:56:49,747
He's on with the tech now.

596
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:54,653
You timing something? 
Your watch.

597
00:56:55,804 --> 00:56:58,634
Oh, I was before I got your call. 

598
00:56:59,714 --> 00:57:03,133
We got it. 
This is our smoking gun.

599
00:57:04,065 --> 00:57:05,685
The lab's off-site. Come on. 

600
00:57:05,686 --> 00:57:09,042
You're coming, right? 

601
00:57:10,316 --> 00:57:11,666
Of course. 

602
00:57:55,318 --> 00:57:57,346
Hey! Who's in there?

603
00:57:57,347 --> 00:58:00,284
- Sr. Easton, was you?
- Ms. Shelby?

604
00:58:00,285 --> 00:58:01,778
Who's in there with you?

605
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:05,015
<i> We are all here, sir, all 6.
What the hell is going on? </i>

606
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,612
What to see?

607
00:58:07,613 --> 00:58:09,882
<i> Nothing at all, it's dark. </ i></i>

608
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:14,078
- What is that sound?
- I do not know, but we are bound to something.

609
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:17,540
<i> - turns.
- Take us out of here! </i>

610
00:58:19,105 --> 00:58:22,154
<i>Please 
Get us out of here. </i>

611
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:39,196
<i> Help,
Sr. Easton, help us. </i>

612
00:58:42,073 --> 00:58:43,387
<i> Sr. Easton, please. </i>

613
00:58:43,388 --> 00:58:45,222
<i> Help us get out of here. </i>

614
00:58:45,223 --> 00:58:48,171
Mr. Easton, what is this?

615
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,724
It's a game.

616
00:58:51,725 --> 00:58:54,205
<i> game?
What the hell are you talking about? </i>

617
00:59:02,815 --> 00:59:03,921
<i>Hello, William.</i>

618
00:59:03,922 --> 00:59:07,830
<i>Before you are six of your most valuable associates.</i>

619
00:59:07,831 --> 00:59:10,658
<i>The ones who find errors on policies.</i>

620
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:13,655
<i>Their findings result in over two-thirds of all applications</i> 

621
00:59:13,656 --> 00:59:17,129
<i>denied or prematurely terminated.</i>

622
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:20,533
<i>Now you must apply your "analysis" to them</i>

623
00:59:20,534 --> 00:59:23,710
<i>and be able to find their errors.</i>

624
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,630
<i>Six ride the carousel, </i>

625
00:59:28,693 --> 00:59:31,561
<i>but only two can get off. </i>

626
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:34,050
<i>The decision of which two will survive</i>   

627
00:59:34,051 --> 00:59:37,706
<i>falls upon you,
but remember: the mounted gun will continue </i>
628
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:41,987
<i>to fire until all six rounds are spent.</i>

629
00:59:42,652 --> 00:59:47,160
<i>And if no decision is made on your part, 
all six will perish.</i> 

630
00:59:48,368 --> 00:59:51,919
<i>To offer the two reprieves, you must press 
</i>

631
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,603
<i> both buttons at once in the box before you.</i>

632
00:59:54,604 --> 00:59:58,936
<i>However, in doing so, 
you will give a sacrifice of your own. </i>

633
00:59:58,937 --> 01:00:01,673
<i>Two can live. Four will die.</i> 

634
01:00:01,674 --> 01:00:06,161
<i>Your decision is symbolized 
by the blood on your hands.</i>

635
01:00:12,346 --> 01:00:14,455
Wake up! 
You've got to get us out of here! 

636
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:20,259
Listen to me! 
I am the one who should live. 

637
01:00:20,688 --> 01:00:22,095
Fuck!

638
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:27,519
Jesus!

639
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:29,864
Please! Mr. Easton!

640
01:00:29,865 --> 01:00:33,198
Please! Follow policy, Mr. Easton!  
Follow the policy! Please!

641
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:34,864
Do it!

642
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:36,181
Please!

643
01:00:36,182 --> 01:00:38,037
Follow the policy, Mr. Easton!

644
01:00:54,206 --> 01:00:55,770
Mr. E! 

645
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:58,068
You always said we're only 
as strong as the weakest link!

646
01:00:58,069 --> 01:01:00,591
-I'm the strongest! You can't let me die! 
-Fuck you! 

647
01:01:00,632 --> 01:01:02,947
I'm healthy! I'm healthy! 

648
01:01:05,126 --> 01:01:07,050
I have two kids! 

649
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:08,957
You know them, Will! 

650
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,256
Please, they can't get on without me! 
They need me! 

651
01:01:33,063 --> 01:01:35,056
-Thanks....thank you...

652
01:01:37,992 --> 01:01:40,721
I do not even know Mr. Easton.

653
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:45,243
My parents are sick! They need me! I'm all they have! 

654
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:48,026
-You fucking liar! Your parents hate you! They cut you off! 
-What?! That's not true! 

655
01:01:48,107 --> 01:01:52,158
I'm pregnant! I'm pregnant! 

656
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,176
No she's not! She's lying! 

657
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:57,043
-She's fucking lying! Mr. Easton, she's lying! 
-No,I'm not!

658
01:02:04,349 --> 01:02:06,510
Please! Please! Push the thing! 

659
01:02:06,511 --> 01:02:09,016
Seriously!

660
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:12,009
-I'm pregnant!
-She's fucking lying!

661
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:15,097
No! , no! , no!

662
01:02:24,483 --> 01:02:26,523
Oh, please! Forget that! 

663
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:34,963
Mr. Easton! My parents are loaded! 
They'll give you whatever you want! 

664
01:02:34,964 --> 01:02:37,063
But if you do not see them for years!

665
01:02:41,031 --> 01:02:42,652
Dave! 
Fuck you!

666
01:02:44,326 --> 01:02:46,589
Christ! Mr. Easton, come on! 

667
01:02:48,749 --> 01:02:50,699
Mr. Easton, please.

668
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,893
Okay, listen to me, Mr. Easton!

669
01:03:00,894 --> 01:03:02,492
Mr. Easton! I'm on your side

670
01:03:02,493 --> 01:03:04,445
and I can help you. 

671
01:03:05,095 --> 01:03:07,929
-You cannot trust this bitch! 
-What?! 

672
01:03:11,643 --> 01:03:14,336
She is all lies! You cannot believe her! She has 
already lied and she's going to continue to do it! 

673
01:03:15,299 --> 01:03:18,662
-You know it! Trust me! 
-What about you?! 

674
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:20,963
It's me, Josh.

675
01:03:32,493 --> 01:03:36,199
Help me!

676
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,295
Fuck!

677
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,989
-Oh, well that's it, isn't it?! 

678
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:02,417
It's over! 

679
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:05,053
-You motherfucker! 
-Stop it... 

680
01:04:06,073 --> 01:04:08,186
You spineless, pussy-whipped 

681
01:04:08,187 --> 01:04:10,158
MOTHERFUCKER!

682
01:04:10,511 --> 01:04:12,196
That's all it takes, huh?! 

683
01:04:12,197 --> 01:04:15,251
Bitch says one thing and its all over!  

684
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:17,029
You know what, William?! 

685
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:18,865
Your policy is 

686
01:04:19,072 --> 01:04:20,657
BULLSHIT!

687
01:04:20,658 --> 01:04:23,078
Fucking bullshit! 

688
01:04:23,448 --> 01:04:26,212
Will you listen to me, you son of a bitch?! 
I did everything for you. 

689
01:04:33,533 --> 01:04:35,003
Look at me! 

690
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:37,796
When you're killing me, you look at me! 

691
01:04:52,866 --> 01:04:55,029
Oh My god...

692
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:27,019
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

693
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:29,912
<i>This is the same helplessness
you bestowed onto others.</i>


694
01:05:31,275 --> 01:05:33,968
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

695
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:37,288
How's it going? 

696
01:05:37,302 --> 01:05:38,751
Good.

697
01:05:40,044 --> 01:05:41,378
This is it. 

698
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:43,969
Whoever made this tape had access to 

699
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:46,148
some very impressive audio filtration equipment.

700
01:05:46,418 --> 01:05:48,624
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

701
01:05:48,874 --> 01:05:51,829
Fortunately, we have some tricks of our own, here.

702
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:55,864
I can turn his algorithm upside-down and let us 
hear what he really sounds like. 

703
01:05:58,763 --> 01:06:00,312
Let's hear what you got. 

704
01:06:02,939 --> 01:06:05,517
<i>Right now, you're feeling helpless.</i>

705
01:06:07,059 --> 01:06:08,495
-You okay? 
-Huh? 

706
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:11,679
You seem a little... preoccupied. 

707
01:06:12,038 --> 01:06:14,244
I'm just anxious about the tape. 

708
01:06:22,836 --> 01:06:26,014
You know, there are still a couple of things 
I can't quite wrap my head around.

709
01:06:26,835 --> 01:06:29,684
Like, I don't understand Strahm's motivation.

710
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:32,530
He was my partner for 5 years.

711
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:34,757
I mean, 
we all knew he was a bit of a hothead,

712
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:37,679
but I never saw any indication of psychotic behavior. 

713
01:06:37,986 --> 01:06:40,834
You can't really tell when 
someone's so good on the inside. 

714
01:06:43,948 --> 01:06:46,482
<i>...helpless. </i>

715
01:06:46,689 --> 01:06:48,353
Hear that?

716
01:06:49,587 --> 01:06:50,972
I'm getting there. 

717
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,037
Come on. I thought you had something to show us. 

718
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:57,014
It's just I never really 
thought of him being vengeful.

719
01:06:57,991 --> 01:07:00,641
You know. I mean, 
all the facts are there.

720
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:06,635
Something doesn't sit right. 

721
01:07:06,636 --> 01:07:08,813
Listen. It's getting closer. 

722
01:07:09,505 --> 01:07:11,540
You know, there is an alternative. 

723
01:07:11,896 --> 01:07:14,724
Let's say that, Strahm killed Seth Baxter specifically 

724
01:07:14,725 --> 01:07:17,630
to set you up as an accomplice to Jigsaw. 

725
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:20,001
...Okay. 

726
01:07:20,985 --> 01:07:22,405
Well, there's a problem with that, though.

727
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:26,296
On further analysis of Strahm's fingerprints, 

728
01:07:26,297 --> 01:07:30,168
it was found that the uric acid levels 

729
01:07:30,169 --> 01:07:34,076
were inconsistent for an individual with
 an active epidural metabolism. 

730
01:07:34,077 --> 01:07:35,723
In other words?

731
01:07:35,724 --> 01:07:38,479
In other words, when you left 
his fingerprints on the latest victim,

732
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,525
Strahm was already dead by then! 

733
01:07:40,805 --> 01:07:42,486
There it is. 

734
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:44,967
<i>Right now, you are feeling helpless.</i>

735
01:08:08,265 --> 01:08:10,118
Who else knows about me? 

736
01:08:12,677 --> 01:08:14,445
Who knows about me? 

737
01:08:15,848 --> 01:08:17,344
Everyone! 

738
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:19,090
You lie. 

739
01:08:19,098 --> 01:08:20,808
You're a fucking liar... 

740
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:02,212
<i>Because I found something you'll want to see</i>

741
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:03,998
<i>It was at the location where John died.</i>

742
01:11:03,999 --> 01:11:06,195
<i>Does it mean anything to you? </i>

743
01:11:10,261 --> 01:11:11,449
What are you doing?

744
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:13,797
I'm trying to finish this
as soon as possible.

745
01:11:13,798 --> 01:11:15,192
We do not know what will happen.

746
01:11:15,193 --> 01:11:17,053
Do not just sit here doing nothing.

747
01:11:17,054 --> 01:11:19,745
We must make a decision,
Don't you understand?

748
01:11:40,816 --> 01:11:41,933
Ok.

749
01:11:41,934 --> 01:11:43,571
You can pull it.

750
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:45,389
I love you.

751
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,511
I love you,too.

752
01:11:48,027 --> 01:11:49,652
Departed.

753
01:11:52,698 --> 01:11:55,253
No. I do not know what will happen.

754
01:12:05,295 --> 01:12:06,891
At the three draft.

755
01:12:09,397 --> 01:12:11,307
No. No.

756
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:14,517
One ...

757
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:16,969
Two ...

758
01:12:18,283 --> 01:12:19,807
Three!

759
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:23,031
What the fuck?

760
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:27,090
This thing not working!

761
01:12:27,831 --> 01:12:29,126
This thing does not work...

762
01:12:29,663 --> 01:12:31,244
What the fuck?

763
01:12:36,082 --> 01:12:37,792
I think I know what it is used.

764
01:12:52,806 --> 01:12:55,697
<i>Get used to me, 'cause I'm not going anywhere. </i>

765
01:12:55,698 --> 01:12:57,636
<i>You sure about that?</i>

766
01:13:02,794 --> 01:13:04,762
<i>Amanda will fail you.</i>

767
01:13:05,718 --> 01:13:07,471
<i>We'll see</i>

768
01:13:13,087 --> 01:13:17,460
<i>Amanda, you were with Cecil 
the night Jill lost Gideon. </i>

769
01:13:21,286 --> 01:13:23,204
I can't fucking do... I don't want to get-- 

770
01:13:23,205 --> 01:13:25,667
What do you mean you don't want to-- 

771
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:29,026
Run, fucking pussy! Go! Go! Go! 

772
01:13:31,187 --> 01:13:32,725
Cecil? What're you doing!

773
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,894
<i>You killed their child. </i>

774
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,316
<i>You know it, and I know it.</i>

775
01:13:43,317 --> 01:13:45,471
<i>So do exactly as I say: </i> 

776
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:47,561
<i>kill Lynn Denlon,</i> 

777
01:13:47,701 --> 01:13:50,355
<i>or I will tell John what you did.</i>

778
01:13:51,169 --> 01:13:53,430
<i>She doesn't deserve to go free!</i>

779
01:13:53,431 --> 01:13:56,429
<i>Amanda, Lynn is more important than you know. </i>

780
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:46,051
-I did it. I made it.I made it! 


781
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,317
I've done it!!

782
01:14:48,352 --> 01:14:51,826
-<i>If you fail, you will never see your family again.</i>

783
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:00,794
- What are you doing here?
- Will! 

784
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:03,829
Pamela.

785
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:05,032
Yes

786
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:08,053
<i>I know it's your birthday, and I'm going to 
make it up to you. I promise.</i> 

787
01:15:08,054 --> 01:15:10,381
<i>You're really standing up your sister for work?</i>

788
01:15:10,382 --> 01:15:12,149
<i>I'm your only family. </i>

789
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:14,497
Are you okay?

790
01:15:15,964 --> 01:15:17,282
Let her go!

791
01:15:17,283 --> 01:15:19,177
I made it! I won! 

792
01:15:19,275 --> 01:15:22,445
<i> Shit, I followed your fucking rules.
Now let it go. </ i></i>

793
01:15:22,733 --> 01:15:25,186
You son a bitch.

794
01:15:25,599 --> 01:15:28,848
You've just given me a death sentence,
I mean, who's gonna cover me now? 

795
01:15:28,849 --> 01:15:30,533
<i>You just killed me.</i>

796
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,496
You're the man who killed my dad. 

797
01:16:01,143 --> 01:16:02,317
<i>Hello, Tara.</i>

798
01:16:02,318 --> 01:16:06,589
<i>My apologies for exposing you 
and your son to this kind of treatment, </i>

799
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:09,760
<i>but I can assure you it is not without reason. </i>

800
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:13,709
<i>The man before you just made the</i> 

801
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:15,212
<i>sacrifices to save the life of a loved one.</i>

802
01:16:15,213 --> 01:16:19,285
<i>However, when given the opportunity 
to save your husband's life,</i> 

803
01:16:19,351 --> 01:16:21,124
<i>he chose not to. </i>

804
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:23,187
<i>Now, you will be given the power</i>

805
01:16:23,188 --> 01:16:24,983
<i> to save a life. </i>

806
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:28,781
<i>Will you grant this man 
the opportunity to continue living,</i> 

807
01:16:29,032 --> 01:16:33,233
<i>or will you dispense the same death 
sentence he issued your husband? </i>

808
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,312
<i>Live or die. </i>

809
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:37,803
<i>The choice is yours. </i>

810
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,809
It's not my game. 

811
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:53,669
<i>I'm leaving you a box, today</i>

812
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:57,671
<i>and its contents are of grave importance</i>

813
01:16:59,747 --> 01:17:01,600
<i>Ms. Tuck, what's in the box?</i>

814
01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:28,072
Please. Forgive me. 

815
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,377
Please! 

816
01:17:30,566 --> 01:17:32,598
Have mercy, please! 

817
01:17:32,599 --> 01:17:34,331
Did he show mercy 

818
01:17:34,332 --> 01:17:36,828
When my husband was suffering? 

819
01:17:46,546 --> 01:17:48,943
John left you 5 envelopes.

820
01:17:49,724 --> 01:17:52,364
The sixth one was for me.

821
01:17:56,588 --> 01:17:58,784
This is John's will. 

822
01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:07,095
- He had no choice! 
- He always had a choice!

823
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:10,474
Please, no. 

824
01:18:10,475 --> 01:18:12,843
The only reason I'm doing this is not because

825
01:18:12,894 --> 01:18:14,518
I can't forgive you for what you did to me.

826
01:18:16,394 --> 01:18:18,319
The reason I'm doing this is because  

827
01:18:18,745 --> 01:18:20,792
I couldn't forgive myself for 

828
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:22,696
what you might do to someone else. 

829
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:25,007
Please, no.

830
01:18:26,783 --> 01:18:29,022
- You'll never kill again. 
- Please. Please. Please don't. 

831
01:18:39,774 --> 01:18:42,658
I can't... 
I can't kill him. 

832
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:48,509
I can.

833
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:50,486
No, Brent!

834
01:18:50,487 --> 01:18:52,985
You killed my father, you motherfucker!

835
01:18:55,741 --> 01:18:57,365
Now you burn in hell! 

836
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,999
<i>Those are the rules, Harold! </i>

837
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,517
<i>You've just given me a death sentence.</i>

838
01:19:25,518 --> 01:19:27,007
<i>So, in a sense...</i>

839
01:19:27,008 --> 01:19:29,880
<i>you choose who lives or dies?</i>

840
01:19:31,993 --> 01:19:33,911
<i>It's policy, John. It's policy.</i>

841
01:19:33,912 --> 01:19:35,849
<i>Who devised that formula?</i>

842
01:19:40,445 --> 01:19:42,198
<i>You think it's the living</i> 

843
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:45,139
<i>that will have ultimate judgement over you, </i>

844
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:48,002
<i>because the dead will have 
no claim over your soul.</i>

845
01:19:52,218 --> 01:19:54,200
<i>But you may be mistaken.</i> 

846
01:19:59,433 --> 01:20:01,329
Game over. 

847
01:20:01,737 --> 01:20:03,276
No! No! 

848
01:20:29,886 --> 01:20:31,438
<i>So when's your test, detective? </i>

849
01:20:34,087 --> 01:20:35,361
<i>I don't need one. </i>

850
01:20:35,362 --> 01:20:37,057
<i>Oh, yeah? </i>

851
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:45,828
<i>You know why you're here, don't you?</i>

852
01:20:50,915 --> 01:20:53,999
<i>I want to know if you have 
what it takes to survive.</i>

853
01:20:54,415 --> 01:20:56,687
<i>You feel you now have control, don't you? </i>

854
01:20:56,688 --> 01:20:59,957
<i>You think you will walk away untested?</i>

855
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:16,402
<i>I'm only carrying out John's final requests.</i>

856
01:21:16,403 --> 01:21:19,515
<i>Do you like how brutality feels, Mark? </i>

857
01:21:19,914 --> 01:21:22,776
<i>From now on, 
I control all aspects of the game.</i> 

858
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:24,335
<i>That's not what John wanted. </i>

859
01:21:24,336 --> 01:21:25,695
<i>You want a chance? </i>

860
01:21:25,829 --> 01:21:27,811
<i>I'll give you a chance.</i> 

861
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:50,846
