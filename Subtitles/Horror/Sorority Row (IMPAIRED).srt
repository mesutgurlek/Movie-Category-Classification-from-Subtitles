Shh. You're dead, dummy.

159

So the only thing to settle on is the body.

160
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:21,466
Do we wrap it in the blanket as it is,
or do we chop it into little pieces first?

161
00:10:21,627 --> 00:10:25,540
Okay. Let's try not to leave our DNA
all over the place. Thank you.

So, what's it gonna be?

One big chunk or little bits and pieces?

164
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:33,265
In premed, we learned that if there's air
in the lungs or the chest cavity

165
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:34,655
the body will float to the surface.

166
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:37,500
Yeah, she's right. We can't have her body
floating to the top.

Yeah. Somebody will find her.

What about those implants?
Does silicone float?

169
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,583
All right. Everybody spread out and find
sharp rocks to dismember the body with.

are you gonna keep this going?

to live with a secret like this?

310
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:14,815
JESSICA: Of course we do.

311
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,386
We're Theta Pi.

312
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:20,862
Now let's go wash the blood off in the lake.
And get back to the party.

313
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,304
We knew you'd come around, Cass.

314
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:40,940
Thank you, Cassidy.

315
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,375
Come on.

316
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,259
<i>ANDY: As I stand
here with you today,</i>

317
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:11,622
<i>I'm reminded of one of my favorite quotes.</i>

318
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:14,585
<i>"Reputation comes
from the company you keep. "</i>

319
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:19,426
<i>Well, thanks to you all,
the company I've kept these past four years</i>

320
00:20:19,907 --> 00:20:23,616
<i>has provided me with a reputation
I will always be proud of.</i>

321
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,505
<i>Congratulations, graduates.</i>

322
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,259
<i>Good luck. And God bless.</i>

323
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:28,860
(ALL CHEERING)

324
00:20:34,987 --> 00:20:38,218
To my sisters at Theta Pi,
not just for four years, but forever.

325
00:20:38,707 --> 00:20:41,904
CLAIRE: Congrats, ladies.
JESSICA: Ellie, you drink like a girl.

326
00:20:42,627 --> 00:20:44,583
ELLIE: Ooh. That went up my nose.

327
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,226
CLAIRE: Here, Jess. Have a sip.

328
00:20:46,387 --> 00:20:48,139
CLAIRE: Cheers!
CHUGS: Cheers!

329
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:55,346
CLAIRE: I'm gonna miss you guys.

330
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:58,339
CASSIDY: This is gonna be awful.

331
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:00,017
So, let's skip it.

332
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:02,178
We don't have to go to
some stupid luncheon.

333
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:05,180
My mother is a legacy.
She wants to see the house.

334
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,907
Think about the good side.
You live through tonight,

335
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,535
then tomorrow, we drive down
to my parents' place

336
00:21:10,707 --> 00:21:12,698
and wake up to waves crashing
on the beach.

337
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,983
Yeah, well, if I thought
we'd be waking up in the same bed,

338
00:21:15,147 --> 00:21:17,980
- maybe it would give me a thrill.
- My parents still think it's the '50s.

339
00:21:18,147 --> 00:21:22,026
Mmm-hmm. Did I mention that I know
some great hotels in the area?

340
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:28,417
Hey, what happened to you
and your sisters, anyway?

341
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:31,263
You were all so close,
then after Megan disappeared...

342
00:21:31,427 --> 00:21:32,940
Could we not talk about that?

343
00:21:34,547 --> 00:21:35,741
I keep hoping you'll change your mind.

344
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:37,977
Can we please just talk about
something else?

345
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,458
I just want you to know I'm here for you.

346
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:57,859
I think you put this on wrong.

347
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,625
And you definitely put this on wrong.

348
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,941
Let me guess. I put these on wrong, too.

349
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:16,505
(BOTH GIGGLING)

350
00:22:34,827 --> 00:22:36,180
I'm so excited.

351
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:38,945
- It's so pretty.
- Wow. Look at this place.

352
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,540
You'd almost think nice people lived here.

353
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:41,856
Hey, be nice.

354
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:47,505
And there's the devil herself.

355
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:52,265
Mr. and Mrs. Tappan!
I haven't seen you in forever.

356
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:53,780
Hi, Jessica.

357
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:57,496
Well, well, well, if it isn't the boy
who has taken our little Cassidy away.

358
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,464
She's a big girl.
She can make her own decisions.

359
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:03,415
Careful. Don't you know? Earth and fire
can't break the bonds of Theta Pi.

360
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:05,498
After all, we're sisters.

361
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:07,861
Excuse me.

362
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:10,218
So, where is everyone? Chugs?

363
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:11,696
Chugs...

364
00:23:12,427 --> 00:23:13,303
Well, you know Chugs.

365
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:16,903
She's always willing to help out
with a little freshman orientation.

366
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:23,179
You taste like vomit.

367
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:26,420
That's because I threw up before.
But I ate a mint, so you're fine.

368
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:31,263
Oops! I forgot to wear underwear.

369
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:35,743
And it's really cold down there.

370
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:40,178
Maybe you could warm it up for me?

371
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:43,863
This whole thing's kind of grossing me out.

372
00:23:45,627 --> 00:23:49,063
Whatever. Move it, loser.
Not my fault you're gay.

373
00:23:52,227 --> 00:23:55,981
This has been the best four years
of our lives.

374
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:59,020
The best five years for some of us.
Not mentioning any names.

375
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,302
Becky Reed.

376
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:04,018
We have this luncheon every year

377
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:06,985
to celebrate the long-lasting ties
of sisterhood.

378
00:24:07,427 --> 00:24:09,895
And to remember that our motto,

379
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:15,585
"Trust, respect, honor,
secrecy and solidarity,"

380
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,783
are truly words that last a lifetime.

381
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:20,541
As you can see by looking
at the east wing of the house,

382
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:22,584
renovations are getting underway.

383
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:26,622
So the house, like our sisterhood,
will be stronger than ever.

384
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,223
We have our beloved housemother to thank

385
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,820
for all of her hard work
on getting this done.

386
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:32,386
Thank you, Mrs. Crenshaw.

387
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:33,696
GIRL: Thank you.

388
00:24:43,227 --> 00:24:44,057
(INAUDIBLE)

389
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:49,301
However, as happy as this day is,
there's still one whom we cannot forget.

390
00:24:50,507 --> 00:24:52,418
One of our sisters is still missing.

391
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:58,057
And we hope and pray
that she will come back to us.

392
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:01,936
To Megan.

393
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,901
No frigging way.

394
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:07,615
We love and miss you always.

395
00:25:09,627 --> 00:25:10,980
(SCREAMING)

396
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:13,025
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

397
00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:17,497
Well, as you can see, some of us
are still a little overwhelmed by it all.

398
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:26,739
Okay, who up and faints anymore?

399
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:28,022
It's okay. I told them it was the heat.

400
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:30,826
- It was Megan. I know it was her.
- It was her sister, dumbass.

401
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,057
And might I say, you played it real cool.

402
00:25:34,347 --> 00:25:38,545
Hi. I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to scare you, Ellie.

403
00:25:38,707 --> 00:25:39,822
How'd she know my name?

404
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:44,026
I'm Maggie. I met you before.
All of you. When I was 15.

405
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:47,259
Right. You're bigger. You've grown up.

406
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,856
I decided I'm coming to Rosman next year.

407
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:55,345
I think it's important for my sister.
You know, some closure.

408
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:58,465
And I think it'd be good
for my parents, too, so...

409
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:00,060
So, how are they doing?

410
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,263
Okay. They couldn't come today.

411
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,738
It's still way too hard.

412
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:06,860
But I didn't want to miss it.

413
00:26:07,027 --> 00:26:10,337
Anyways, I just wanted to come by
and say hello

414
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:13,704
and let you guys know that I'm gonna be
rushing Theta Pi next year.

415
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,346
I'm gonna be sick.

416
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:19,225
We'd be lucky to have you.

417
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:23,700
Um, you guys having a party tonight?

418
00:26:23,867 --> 00:26:27,098
Yeah. Yeah. You know,
you should totally come.

419
00:26:27,267 --> 00:26:30,942
Wait, no, you're rushing next year
and that violates Greek rules of recruiting.

420
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:33,667
Well, I won't tell if you guys won't.

421
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:37,547
Well, we have to go.
Sorry about tonight, but I'll tell you what,

422
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,540
I will personally see to your future
as a Theta Pi next year.

423
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:42,296
- Okay.
- Okay.

424
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,900
- Nice to meet you guys.
- You, too.

425
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,183
Friend me on Facebook, I'll totally confirm.

426
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:48,336
- Bye.
- CLAIRE: Bye.

427
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:53,582
Was it just me,
or was that girl all sorts of creepy.

428
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:54,782
Can't imagine why.

429
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,619
No way she's getting in with that outfit.

430
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:58,739
Who is ready to party?

431
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:00,784
MICKEY: That would be me.
That would be me.

432
00:27:02,507 --> 00:27:03,542
That's what I was looking for.

433
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:04,662
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

434
00:27:04,827 --> 00:27:06,624
- Hi, you.
- Hi.

435
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:08,698
Chugs, your mom? Smoking.

436
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:10,380
I would definitely have
a sip of that MILF-shake.

437
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,459
- Hey!
- If I wasn't dating you, of course, Claire.

438
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:16,300
Okay, we have two hours
before this place is packed.

439
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:18,185
I got to get to my shrink. Score some Oxys.

440
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,020
Hey, you think if you blow him,
you can get enough for everyone?

441
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:22,666
- Kyle, excuse me.
- What? I'm serious.

442
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:26,297
I wish it were that painless. Unfortunately
for me, he's more of an ass man.

443
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:30,464
Okay, you guys, it's on.
Tonight we bring the house down.

444
00:27:30,627 --> 00:27:31,537
That we do.

445
00:27:31,707 --> 00:27:33,698
Kyle, can you and Mickey
go get some decorations from the cellar?

446
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:35,539
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- Yeah, we can do that.

447
00:27:35,707 --> 00:27:36,981
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye.

448
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,184
KYLE: You are so whipped.
MICKEY: Speak for yourself, pretty boy.

449
00:27:39,347 --> 00:27:40,257
(VIBRATING)

450
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:41,780
It's Ellie's.

451
00:27:43,667 --> 00:27:45,623
(ALL CELL PHONES RINGING)

452
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:52,625
CLAIRE: What? Oh, my God.

453
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,698
CASSIDY: Who sent this?
JESSICA: What the hell?

454
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:56,698
- Oh, my God.
- Is this a joke?

455
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,300
Garret! I'm gonna kill him.

456
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:00,503
Garret? What the fuck is this, Chugs?

457
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,180
It's a joke. It's a really bad joke.

458
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,541
This is beyond sick.

459
00:28:03,707 --> 00:28:04,981
Okay. Why would Garret do this?

460
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:08,059
I can think of a reason. He's gone psycho
and he wants to kill us all.

461
00:28:08,227 --> 00:28:09,546
Hey, he's not...

Hello?

780
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:43,742
Buddy, you graduated. That's awesome.

781
00:52:43,907 --> 00:52:45,704
We're all real impressed.

782

- However, you're blocking...
- Hey!

- Yeah?
- We're gonna pass.

784
00:52:49,147 --> 00:52:51,581
- No. You're not gonna pass.
- No, you're just a little too creepy.

785

- Yeah. And you're not real hot, either.
- That's not very nice.

Cass, I want you to know that

I think it's great
that you've turned into a better person.

I have not become a better person.
I'm far from it.

and getting away from this place.

Yeah, we made

801

a string of bad choices that night.

802

And right now there's not much
we can do about it.

We are sisters.

804
00:54:02,227 --> 00:54:06,857
And right now all we can do
is stick together and get through this thing.

I've been kind of a jerk, all right?

I'll apologize and we can

Kill Megan?
I was talking about trashing my house.

You killed my sister? You fucking bitch!

- Okay, listen. It was an accident

and we'll explain everything later,
but right now Claire is dead,

1093
01:13:48,627 --> 01:13:51,858
Mickey's dead, Chugs is dead
and we don't know if Megan is alive or not.

1094
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:54,097
Wait. So Megan is not dead?

- Kyle.

- Is he in on this thing?
- No.

1098
01:14:03,387 --> 01:14:06,857

Where is Kyle?

1102
01:14:16,547 --> 01:14:19,744
Don't look at me.
He left as soon as he heard you coming.

1103
01:14:19,907 --> 01:14:23,217
Well, he, she or it
is about to get two rounds to the face.

And call the police.

was such a badass?

So can you just give me a minute?

1114
01:14:48,227 --> 01:14:51,139
I don't understand. You're saying
that you think my sister's alive?

You guys, that's coming
from the back of the house.

I'm staying here.

I can get his phone and we can call for help.

Bitches.

comes from?

"To say farewell."

Well, to the bitches of Theta Pi,

1249
01:24:53,107 --> 01:24:54,825
I'm saying farewell.

Yes.

Hell, for society in general.

- Of course. Come on, we'll both do Ellie.

You're always saying
we need to do more stuff together.

I mean, she's okay.

She's the weakest of them all.
Hell, she told me.

But, Andy, the house is on fire.
We gotta go.

Ellie! Hey, Andy,
we need to leave right now, okay?

1267
01:25:58,227 --> 01:26:01,424
Okay. You go wait for me outside.

- Okay.

Go tell Ellie to meet me in the basement.

Come on, come on.

- Okay, we've got to get out of here now.

- Is it safe?
- No, it's not safe,

1275
01:26:38,187 --> 01:26:39,256
but it's not getting any safer.

Do you have any idea
what I've done to give you back your life?

1279
