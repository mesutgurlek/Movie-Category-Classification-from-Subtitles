00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:16,992
Hey, I got a joke for you...

174
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:23,548
No, it's gross.

175
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,301
[laughter]

[shower running]

177
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:35,060
Can you bring me my bathrobe, please?

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,219
Thank you.

[knocking at door]

182
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:39,457
Come on in.

183
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:40,909
What's wrong?

184
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:44,579
Camille is here.

185
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,132
[sighs]

186
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:48,666
You want to see her?

187
00:11:57,561 --> 00:11:59,060
Now listen.

188
00:11:59,146 --> 00:12:02,147
[water splashing]

189
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:07,852
Lena?

190
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:10,155
No, it's me.

191
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:15,493
What are you doing? Get out!

192
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:19,614
Dad!

193
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,620
She doesn't remember anything...

194
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:30,008
Not the accident, nothing that happened...

195
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:32,010
Only that she was on a school bus trip,

196
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:35,013
and then she just woke up

197
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:38,016
in the woods.

198
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:40,135
It's just not possible.

199
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,888
No, it's not,

200
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:45,640
but you just saw her.

201
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:48,226
But there has to be some other explanation.

202
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:49,811
Like what?

203
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:53,148
Both going crazy at the same time?

204
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,818
[door clicks]

205
00:13:03,293 --> 00:13:04,325
What's the matter?

206
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,712
Is something wrong?

207
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:10,999
Since when are you smoking again?

208
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,337
Did Mom tell you what happened to me today?

209
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:17,839
It's kind of weird, isn't it?

210
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:19,507
It's like a coma

211
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,677
or a neurological thing.

212
00:13:22,813 --> 00:13:24,512
Maybe I should see a doctor.

213
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:27,565
How do you feel now?

214
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:30,485
Fine.

215
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:52,590
You guys are acting very weird.

216
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:54,042
Are you sure everything's okay?

217
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:57,045
Yeah.

218
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,347
Just glad you're okay.

219
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,797
Hey, Pilar.

220
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,799
Dr. Han.

221
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:36,634
Working late, huh?

222
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,253
Yeah. I had clinic tonight.

223
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:41,256
Isn't that supposed to
be over at, like, 8:00?

224
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:43,892
I know, but I just can't
rush anybody through.

225
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:45,009
Cool.

226
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:56,571
[haunting music]

227
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:17,056
Hey.

228
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:19,892
What are you doing out here?

229
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:26,265
Where are your parents?

230
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,983
Are you lost?

231
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,491
You must be cold. Where's your coat?

232
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,995
What's your name?

233
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,207
Here, come inside.

234
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,806
Well, well.

235
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:09,024
Who's this?

236
00:17:09,143 --> 00:17:11,310
What a cute boy. What's your name?

237
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:15,281
What's his name?

238
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:19,618
Victor.

239
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:27,543
- Good night, Annie.
- Good night, Julie.

240
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:45,978
If you don't talk to me,

241
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:48,063
I'm gonna call the police.

242
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:57,989
Okay, I'm dialing.

243
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:03,211
Here I go.

244
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:07,298
- [buttons beeping]
- 9-1-1.

245
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:13,471
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

246
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,058
Hello?

247
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:22,180
I'm sorry.

248
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:23,765
I dialed by mistake.

249
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,401
Everything's fine.

250
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:40,999
You can stay here tonight,

251
00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:44,119
but tomorrow, I'm taking you to the police.

252
00:19:11,948 --> 00:19:14,949
[lock clicking]

253
00:19:17,037 --> 00:19:19,454
- Claire?
- In here.

254
00:19:26,546 --> 00:19:28,246
Oh.

255
00:19:28,331 --> 00:19:30,131
Hey.

256
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:31,716
Hey.

257
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:34,252
What, um... what's going on?

258
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:39,641
Camille has come back.

259
00:19:43,063 --> 00:19:44,979
Do you want to see her?

260
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,184
She's in her room.

261
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,606
Come and see.

00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:05,667
Honey, can we come in?

264
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:07,368
Yeah.

265
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:11,256
What are all these

266
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:13,875
photos of me and candles
doing in my drawer?

267
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:16,511
Camille, this is Peter.

268
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:19,714
He's a psychologist.

269
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,432
I thought he could talk to you.

270
00:20:25,272 --> 00:20:26,804
Hello, Camille.

271
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,691
You called a psychologist?

272
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:31,609
Actually, I'm a friend

273
00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:32,810
of your mother's.

274
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:34,028
Since when?

275
00:20:34,114 --> 00:20:35,730
I've never met you before.

276
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,365
Uh, well, I run

277
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,983
the Caldwell Community Center,

278
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:43,121
and your mother used to...
Used to volunteer there.

279
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,456
Yeah.

280
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:46,875
May I come in?

281
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,793
Sure.

282
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:55,967
Uh...

283
00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:59,971
So, Camille,

284
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,224
do you remember anything
after the bus accident?

285
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,645
I was in an accident?

286
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:09,480
Why don't I remember?

287
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,350
Uh, well, sometimes

288
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:13,818
when something traumatic happens,

289
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:17,355
our brain blocks it out
as a defense mechanism,

290
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,469
as a way of protecting ourselves.

291
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:22,416
The memories usually return

292
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:24,829
once we're more equipped to deal with them.

293
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:29,617
So the bus crashed,

294
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:31,836
and now I have amnesia?

295
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:34,455
Uh...

296
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,625
It's more complicated than that.

297
00:21:40,964 --> 00:21:43,798
Camille...

298
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:47,852
Don't worry.

299
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:49,020
What's happened to you

300
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:51,806
is extraordinary and wonderful.

301
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:57,630
Just give yourself some time to process it,

302
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:00,365
to just be back

303
00:22:00,483 --> 00:22:02,450
and to accept everything that's happened,

304
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:06,821
and when you're ready to talk,

305
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:08,823
I'm available any time.

306
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:14,326
I need to go to sleep now.

307
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:18,299
Of course.

308
00:22:18,385 --> 00:22:21,386
Come here, honey, hop in bed.

309
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:25,173
- I'll meet you downstairs.
- Okay.

310
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:48,529
I feel really tired, but I don't think
I'm gonna be able to sleep.

311
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:50,915
Sure you will.

312
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:55,787
Just close your eyes,

313
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:57,705
relax.

314
00:22:59,175 --> 00:23:01,175
Love you.

315
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:09,183
I love you too.

316
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:31,322
Hey, Lucy, it's me.

317
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:34,742
Uh...

318
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:37,578
I really need to talk to you.

319
00:23:37,664 --> 00:23:40,081
Something has happened, and...

320
00:23:43,253 --> 00:23:45,753
Just... can you just call me back?

321
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:02,320
Peter. [chuckles]

322
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,439
To the rescue again.

323
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,194
Hey, I'm just curious...

324
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,449
What, with your degree in
psychology and everything...

325
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:15,950
You know, you've been

326
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:17,869
counseling us since the accident,

327
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:19,504
all of us, you know,

328
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:21,339
parents, and...

329
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:24,842
You told us to find some form
of acceptance with this.

330
00:24:24,961 --> 00:24:26,961
Right?

331
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:29,714
"Remember your children
with a smile on your face,

332
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:31,849
not pain in your heart."

333
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:33,518
- Isn't that what you said?
- Jack...

334
00:24:33,636 --> 00:24:34,969
I'm just curious to know

335
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:38,473
what kind of acceptance am
I supposed to have now.

336
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:40,865
How do you explain this?

337
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:43,111
Honestly, Jack, I have no idea.

338
00:24:43,196 --> 00:24:45,813
As far as I know,

339
00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:49,150
this has never happened before,

340
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:51,402
unless you know otherwise.

341
00:24:53,823 --> 00:24:56,541
Camille is back.

342
00:24:56,659 --> 00:24:57,909
Why are you trying to ruin this?

343
00:24:57,994 --> 00:25:01,129

00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:05,633
I take it you're feeling better?

516
00:42:05,718 --> 00:42:07,134
Much.

517
00:42:35,998 --> 00:42:37,183
You don't want to?

518
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:40,284
It's not that.

519
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:42,119
What?

520
00:42:42,788 --> 00:42:44,464
Is it Camille?

521
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:47,925
We sort of made a promise to each other.

522
00:42:48,044 --> 00:42:49,369
Why?

523
00:42:50,212 --> 00:42:52,340
Because we both like you.

524
00:42:53,683 --> 00:42:55,215
Well, I'm sort of in love with you,

525
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:58,602
so is that fair to me?

526
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:00,054
Sort of?

527
00:43:00,139 --> 00:43:02,022
Sort of...

528
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:03,941
A lot.

529
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:10,531
Camille?

530
00:43:10,616 --> 00:43:12,816
This is due Monday.

531
00:43:15,821 --> 00:43:17,788
You can hear me, right?

532
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,575
Yes.

533
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:23,627
Thank you.

534
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:32,469
Lena...

535
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:48,185
Have you ever, um...

536
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,603
No.

Let me off.

Let me out. Let me out.

Go back to your seat.
