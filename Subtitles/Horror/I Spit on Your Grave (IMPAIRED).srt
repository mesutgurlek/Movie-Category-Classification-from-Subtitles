Oh, yeah, Miss Hills.

10
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:45,975
That is right.

11
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:51,587
I don't suppose you know how
to get out there.

12
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:54,526
No, I don't.

13
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:58,789
Well, listen up.

14
00:02:00,534 --> 00:02:02,866

16
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,338

00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:11,401
Over here

18
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:13,470
there are more
dirt roads and woods.

19
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:15,674
Your cabin's a real beaut.

20
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:18,240
But heck, there ain't another
for a good country mile.

21
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:21,015
I am looking forward
to the peace and quiet.

22
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,818
I知 actually a novelist
and I知 starting my next book here.

23
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:26,758
If that's what you're aiming for.

24
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:29,887

31
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,402
Excuse me.

32
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,837
I didn't mean to frighten you.

33
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:49,603
No, that is okay.

34
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:52,441
You know what?
I am actually lost.

35
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,946
I知 looking for Mockingbird Trail.

36
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,278
Mockingbird Trail.
Yeah, you're lost all right.

37
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:57,943
- Really?

38
00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:59,645
It痴 about 10 miles back.

41
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,121
Okay, thanks.

- Yeah.
- Man: Fancy!

44
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,961
(Laughs)

45
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:22,473
So you know you're running
a little hot.

46
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,535
Maybe I should check up
under your hood for you.

47
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:27,547
(Laughing)

48
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,108
How's that line
working for you?

49
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:35,212
I don't know.
How's that line working for you?

50
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,916
(Dings)

51
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:45,055

57
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,407
- Are you okay?
- I知 fine.

58
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:00,311
Better check your underwear,

(Engine starts)

63
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:21,497
Man:
Got you that time, Johnny.

64
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:23,502

(birds squawking)

68
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,164
Woman:
How's the writing coming?

69
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:13,195
You kidding me?

70
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,173
I should have come out here

71
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,039
You gonna come back
for Hertz's party?

72
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:20,375
- (Door thuds)
- Jen? Did I lose you?

73
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,381

- Barb, hold on a second.

76
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:41,566
(Thuds)

77
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,728
- Jen, what's going on?
- Let me call you back.

(gasps)

82
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:49,227
You've got to be kidding me.

83
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:55,972
Way to go, Jennifer.

84

89
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,464
Ew!

(huffs)

92
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:49,478
Jennifer:
No, it won't flush.

93
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,278
Man: Did you check the seal
on the flapper?

94
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:52,784
I did that already.

95
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:56,311
- You did?
- Yes.

96
00:12:56,355 --> 00:12:58,050
Look, I知 really in a spot here.

- All right, I'll send somebody.
- Okay okay.

98
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:02,084
Thank you.
Thank you.

99
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,289
- You'll be there?
- I知 not going anywhere.

100
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,820
Man:
All right, I値l send someone.

101
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,025
(Phone beeps)

102

103
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,769
Aggh!

104

(Whirring)

105
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:28,245
(grunts)

106
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,983
So is this gonna
take much longer?

107
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,589
Not much.

108
00:13:34,627 --> 00:13:37,687
What's wrong with it?

109
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:42,628
(Water running)

110
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:53,637
(toilet flushes)

111
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,510
Yes!

112
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,447
- All fixed.
- Oh, thank you.

113
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:06,485
Sorry. You saved me from having
to bathe in the lake.

114
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,359
Excuse me.
I, uh- excuse me.

115
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,124
Wait, I didn't-

00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:15,032
(laughing)

118
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,830
Ground rule double.

119
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:19,861
Double my ass. Look at its head.
I knocked its eye clear out.

120
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:22,238
Fine, maybe a triple.

121
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:25,711
But you gotta knock its guts clean out
its mouth if you wanna score a run.

122
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,269
Man, would you turn
that shit off?

123
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:29,213
You're gonna get us in trouble
with that human society.

124
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,307
(Laughs)

125
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,444
- It痴 humane, dipshit.
- Yeah, whatever.

126
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,149
I told you, Andy,
this thing's gonna make me a fortune.

127
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:41,283
So you two retards
gonna go fishing or what?

128
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,228
Hey, speaking of retards...

129
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:46,356
- Bull's-eye!
- Andy!

130
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,731
(Laughs)

131
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:52,431
Well, Stanley,
got us all here now.

132
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:56,032
What's the big show?

133
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:58,134
The big show

134
00:14:58,177 --> 00:15:00,236
is this.

135
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,147
What did you do this time,
film yourself lighting a fart?

136
00:15:04,183 --> 00:15:05,514
(Laughing)

137
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:08,076
I don't know why I bother
with you dipshits.

138
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,283
I got Matthew's girlfriend here
in a very private moment.

139
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:13,189
Andy:
Girlfriend?

140
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:16,662
Matthew ain't had a girlfriend since
he was sucking on his mama's titties.

141
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:20,132
He had that city girl all alone
and he didn't even try to nail her.

142
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:23,263
What city girl?

143
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:24,769
You know what girl.

144
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,999
The one from the gas station
the other day.

145
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,007
The one that had you
on your ass.

146
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,599
(Laughing)

147
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:33,111
She had Matt here fixing
her pipes.

148
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:36,774
She even gave him a kiss
for servicing her.

149
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,306
Bullshit.

150
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:42,344
No, she- she- she did, Johnny.
She kissed me.

151
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,856
Hey, Matthew,

152
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,118
don't you lie to me.

153
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:49,355
Here it comes.
Get ready for it.

154
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:52,558
Oh shit.

155
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:57,565
Andy: Hey, that's some good
camerawork, man.

156
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:00,538
You dirty dog, man.

157
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:02,131
How the fuck did you get that?

158
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:04,540
I've been working nights.

159
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,976
She sure is something
to look at.

160
00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,412
Yeah yeah.

161
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,541
And she likes me.

162
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,017
Come on, Matthew.

163
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:15,384
That girl wouldn't even
give Johnny the time of day.

164
00:16:15,421 --> 00:16:16,820
What?

165
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,017
Shit.

166
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:20,855
I can tame that ass
if I want to.

167
00:16:20,893 --> 00:16:23,828
Come on, Johnny.
You saw that girl.

168
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:25,922
Stuck-up city bitch.

169
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:27,933
City bitch like that
is ungettable.

170
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,765
Bullshit. I値l get it.

171
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:32,202
(Laughing)

172
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,762
Let me tell you something:

173
00:16:33,806 --> 00:16:36,536
I had that bitch
creaming her panties.

174
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:39,373
Yeah, and she had you
shitting in yours.

175
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:43,942
You don't think I can have that
anytime I want to?

176
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:45,541
Hmm?

177
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,027
Let me tell you something:

178
00:16:56,062 --> 00:16:57,859
Bitch like that,

179
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:01,458
she come out here for one reason
and one reason only.

180
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,095
Titties flopping in the window
like that for everyone to see.

181
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,105
Come on, you know.

182
00:17:07,139 --> 00:17:09,130
No no.

183
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:13,077
She's not like that, Johnny.

184
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:17,048
They're all like that.

185
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,849
Big city cock-teasing whore
is all she is.

186
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:22,877
Fuckin' A.

187
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:26,821
Shit, Matthew.

188
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,521
You wouldn't know what to do with
a piece of ass like that if you got it.

189
00:17:29,562 --> 00:17:31,621
No shit.

190
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:35,562
But you're lucky

191
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,228
'cause I知 your friend.

192
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,329
I値l show you the way.

193
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:46,312
(Andy laughs)

194
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:58,619
(pops lips)

195
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:12,929
(sighs)

196
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:39,497
(wood creaking)

197
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,233
(moans)

198
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:17,392
(sighs)

199
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,129
(thumping)

200
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,318
Hello.

201
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:12,757
- (Loud bang)
- (screams)

202
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:49,791
(door thumping)

203
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,690
(gasps)

204
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:55,694
- (bangs)
- (shrieks)

205
00:21:57,863 --> 00:22:00,297
Nice shot, huh?

206
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:01,663
Evening.

207
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,500
Get out of here.
Get out of here right now!

208
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:07,027
- Well now.
- (Camcorder beeps)

209
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:08,733
That ain't very hospitable now, is it?

210
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:11,174
Smile real pretty
for the camera, girl.

211
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:15,136
Mm-mm-mm.

212
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,239
(Men laughing)

213
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,742
You all better get out
of here right now.

214
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:23,414
I called the cops.

215
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:26,253
Oh, she called the cops.

216
00:22:28,427 --> 00:22:31,089
You called the police
or you will call the police?

217
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,725
I called them already.
They're on their way right now.

218
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:36,701
What phone did you
do that with?

219
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:39,568
Matthew told us you dropped
yours in the drain.

220
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,470
Bloop!

221
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:45,776
Let's pick it up.
Where the hell is that boy?

222
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:49,372
Matthew, get your bony ass in here!

223
00:22:49,415 --> 00:22:52,145
- Come on.
- Come here, boy.

224
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:53,913
Get in here, boy.
Hey hey hey.

225
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,079
It痴 all right.
Come on now.

226
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:59,022
Come on, boy.
Come here.

227
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:04,319
Matthew here says

228
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:06,354
that you didn't pay him
for fixing your sink.

229
00:23:06,398 --> 00:23:07,922
That's not true.

230
00:23:07,966 --> 00:23:11,163
He ran out.

231
00:23:11,203 --> 00:23:12,795
I値l take care of it.

232
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:14,567
Andy:
He's shy, huh?

233
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:18,508
Look at that, Matthew.
Look at that. Look at that right there.

234
00:23:18,544 --> 00:23:20,637
Hold up, wait a minute.

235
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,912
Let's not worry
about any of that right now.

236
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,924
What's a pretty little thing like you

237
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,324
doing out here all alone?

238
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,851
I知 writing.

239
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:40,091
I知 a writer.

240
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:42,930
She's a writer.

241
00:23:42,968 --> 00:23:44,833
My boyfriend will be here soon.

242
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,100
He's coming up
to the cabin.

243
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,437
(Laughs)
Is that right?

244
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,170
Oh!

245
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,768
Well, shit.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

246
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:55,279
Boys, now we better
blow on out of here.

247
00:23:55,314 --> 00:23:57,441
We don't wanna interrupt
your date night.

248
00:23:57,483 --> 00:24:01,078
- (Laughing)
- Date night!

249
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,111
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart:

250
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:06,716
There ain't no man
in his right mind

251
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,091
that leaves a pretty little thing

252
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:11,926
like you out here

253
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:13,488
all alone.

254
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,834
He's coming.

255
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,497
Night's almost over.

256
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:23,833
- (Whimpers)
- (men laugh)

257
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:26,674
(sniffs)

258
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:28,703
Oh wow.

259
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,444
- (Laughing)
- (Johnny coughs)

260
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:39,685
Johnny:
Come here.

261
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:41,556
Come here, have a drink with me.
Come on over here.

262
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:48,462
Come here, pretty little thing.

263
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,525
Come here,
have a drink with me.

264
00:24:50,569 --> 00:24:52,503
No.

265
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,802
- (Laughing)
- Oh, there you go.

266
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,535
I don't want to.

267
00:24:56,575 --> 00:25:00,443
What's the matter?
You too good to have a drink with us?

268
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,743
- See?
- Mm-hmm.

269
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:04,874
Please, I just don't want to
have a drink.

270
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,283
What is this shit right here?

271
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,651
'Cause that's already
been opened.

272
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:12,657
Well shit, boys.
You were right.

273
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:14,784
She's too good
to have a drink with us.

274
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:16,294
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

275
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:18,319
What are we to you?

276
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:20,888
A bunch of dirt?

277
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:22,730
I didn't say that.

278
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:24,736
Fuckin' A,
this bitch is a writer.

279
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,228
"No one wants a phone call

280
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:29,740
at 2:00 in the morning.

281
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:31,709
When you're 15,
it's a prank call.

282
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:34,803
When you're 21,
it's a drunk boyfriend call.

283
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,872
But after 25,

284
00:25:36,915 --> 00:25:39,543
it's usually really bad news.

285
00:25:39,585 --> 00:25:42,918
That's how I found out
my father died."

286
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:45,753
Whose daddy died?

287
00:25:47,192 --> 00:25:50,787
(Sobbing) Can't you all
just please leave me alone?

288
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:53,127
Johnny: No!

289
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,600
Just tell me what you want.

290
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:02,433
What do you want?
I offered you my money.

291
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:04,965
Mm-hmm.

292
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,501
Whoa!
(Laughing)

293
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:11,916
(gasps)

294
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:18,616
Here. Here.

295
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,923
Fine. I値l have a drink.

296
00:26:22,961 --> 00:26:24,826
Then you have to leave.

297
00:26:24,863 --> 00:26:27,627
- Andy: All right.
- Johnny: All right.

298
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:33,335
That ain't shit.

299
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:36,034
- Come on. Boo!
- Come on now.

300
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:39,271
Now see, I-

301
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:42,508
I know you can
do better than that.

302
00:26:42,547 --> 00:26:44,538
I知 sure that when you're
out there in the city

303
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,814
with all your hoity-toity
rich friends,

304
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:49,718
I bet you can throw 'em back
with the best of 'em.

305
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,347
Now can't you?

306
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,654
- I took the drink-
- I said drink that shit!

307
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:03,490
- Come on. There you go.
- Chug chug! Guzzle!

308
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,003
- Whoo!
- There it is. There it is.

309
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:09,599
- (Coughs)
- All right, shit.

310
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:11,905
See, that's not
so bad now, is it?

311
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:17,676
Listen, I知 sorry
I embarrassed you the other day.

312
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:20,844
But we're even now, right?

313
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:24,652
Okay?
Just please leave.

314
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,056
Please leave.

315
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:30,186
Well, that's just not
what this is about no more.

316
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:37,001
What is it about?

317
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:43,032
I wanna see your teeth.

318
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:48,069
What?

319
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,906
You heard me,

320
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,418
pretty little show horse.

321
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:56,353
I want

322
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:58,754
to see

323
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,417
your teeth.

324
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:02,757
(Laughing)

325
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:04,694
That-

326
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,960
I don't want to- no.

327
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:17,570
Now you're gonna show
them teeth.

328
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:20,203
You have beautiful teeth.

329
00:28:20,245 --> 00:28:23,408
There.

330
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:25,916
(Whimpering)

331
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,452
There. Let me see 'em.
Real pretty. Real pretty.

332
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:37,495
Let's see more.

333
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,463
Put your fingers

334
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:43,264
on the inside of your mouth
right there.

335
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:46,634
Now take the other two,
stick 'em on the other side.

336
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,798
There you go.

337
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,273
Now pull.

338
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:53,744
Okay, please, I知 begging you,
just go.

339
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:55,508
No.

340
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:57,674
(Groans)

341
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:01,845
Again.

342
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:07,591
Come here.
There it is.

343
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:09,992
Oh man, yeah! Yeah!

344
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:13,156
Yeah, that's it.
Come here. All right.

345
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:17,032
- (Sobbing)
- Shh!

346
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:19,299
That's my pretty little show horse.
Look at you.

347
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:25,508
You know why I know you
ain't got no boyfriend?

348
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:28,274
You know why?

349
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:32,113
'Cause all them
city boys are faggots.

350
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,549
Fuckin' A.

351
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:46,887
Since you ain't got
no boyfriend,

352
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:49,230
well, shit, I figured that...

353
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:56,506
this would be
your man tonight.

354
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,339
Yeah.

355
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:02,244
No?
Come here.

356
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,711
Come on,
give him a little kiss.

357
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:11,210
Give him a little kiss,
come on.

358
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:13,383
Give him a little kiss here.

359
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:15,393
Give him
a little kiss here. Kiss him.

360
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:17,588
Oh shit, come on now.

361
00:30:17,629 --> 00:30:20,564
Come on now. I ain't talking about no
fucking peck like you gave Matthew.

362
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:23,534
I want you to give him
a little kiss now. Go on, kiss him.

363
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:26,298
Get up on your knees.

364
00:30:29,241 --> 00:30:32,039
If I don't like
your enthusiasm,

365
00:30:32,077 --> 00:30:34,739
- I may come bad.
- (Gun cocks)

366
00:30:40,285 --> 00:30:42,344
Open up.
Open up.

367
00:30:42,387 --> 00:30:44,218
There it is. There it is.
There it is.

368
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:46,121
All right, all right.

369
00:30:46,158 --> 00:30:49,559
Breathe through your nose.
Come on, you know this.

370
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,084
Just like it's your
first time again.

371
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:54,030
Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose.

372
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,532
All right, all right.

373
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,092
- (Gagging)
- Shit!

374
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:03,537
Come on now.
Let's let Matthew have the girl.

375
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:06,271
(Stammers)
I d-don't want to.

376
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,710
I don't.

377
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:11,113
What?
What the fuck did you say?

378
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,641
What the hell you mean
you d-d-don't want to?

379
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:17,314
I don't want to, Johnny.

380
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,949
- He d-d-don't want to.
- Come on.

381
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:21,618
Listen to me.

382
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,594
Fuck that, man.

383
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:25,459
I ain't fucking waiting.

384
00:31:25,497 --> 00:31:26,828
Aw shit!

385
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:29,265
Matthew:
She-she likes me.

386
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:30,461
Johnny:
She likes you, Matthew?

387
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:32,299
Go ahead.

388
00:31:32,337 --> 00:31:35,898
- Jennifer: Please.
- Suck it, bitch.

389
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:38,307
Come on now.
We're doing this for you.

390
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:39,970
Go prove it to me.

391
00:31:40,011 --> 00:31:42,138
Uh-huh.
(Laughs)

392
00:31:44,015 --> 00:31:46,609
- Oh God.
- Oh shit!

393
00:31:46,651 --> 00:31:48,642
(Screams)

394
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:51,247
Johnny:
Come on, boys!

395
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:58,219
(Sobbing)

396
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:25,850
Whoa there.

397
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,017
Whoa there.
Easy, darling.

398
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:30,789
(Whimpering)

399
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:33,957
- Help me! Help me, please.
- Okay, I got you.

400
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,990
I was assaulted.

401
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:37,797
He came into my cabin
and he had a gun.

402
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:40,066
Ma'am, it's okay.
You need to calm down now, please.

403
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:41,663
It was in my mouth.

404
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:43,435
He put a gun in my mouth.
You don't understand.

405
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:44,965
I know this one.

406
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,137
She rented the place
down on Mockingbird Trail.

407
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:50,511
- I was assaulted.
- Hey, it's okay.

408
00:32:50,548 --> 00:32:52,812
I知 a sheriff.

409
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:54,751
You're safe.

410
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:57,721
Now tell me what happened.

411
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:59,815
These four men-

412
00:32:59,858 --> 00:33:02,349
there were four men
and they broke into my cabin.

413
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:04,828
And they had a gun
and they assaulted me.

414
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:07,730
Did you get a nice look at them?
Can you ID 'em?

415
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:10,701
Yes, I'd seen them.

416
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:12,862
- Around here?
- Yes, they work at the service station

417
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:15,065
- right outside of town.
- John Miller, no doubt.

418
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:17,904
Yes, they called him Johnny.
And there was this heavyset guy.

419
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:20,274
Sounds like them boys have
been up to no good again.

420
00:33:20,312 --> 00:33:22,780
All right, Earl,
you head on back.

421
00:33:22,814 --> 00:33:25,908
- Me and Miss-
- Hills. Jennifer Hills.

422
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,645
Me and Miss Hills are gonna head
on over to the cabin

423
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:30,450
and straighten things out.

424
00:33:58,283 --> 00:34:01,081
Miller!

425
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,144
Miller, this is the sheriff.

426
00:34:03,188 --> 00:34:06,351
You and your boys are still here,
you come on out right now.

427
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:26,204
Miller, if you're up there,
you'll be leaving by the window.

428
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:32,012
Ma'am, stay here.

429
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:08,545
You here alone?

430
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:10,816
Yes.

431
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:19,997
With all this?

432
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:22,329
I didn't plan on drinking it all
right away.

433
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,961
I was gonna be here
for a couple months.

434
00:35:25,003 --> 00:35:27,130
You drink some this evening?

435
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:28,639
Yes.

436
00:35:48,092 --> 00:35:51,391
One of them went upstairs
and he went through everything.

437
00:36:03,107 --> 00:36:04,699
They do this too?

438
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:07,336
Please, I really don't care
about any of that.

439
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,948
How long you been here?

440
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:13,041
Just a couple days.

441
00:36:14,786 --> 00:36:17,414
Anything strange happen
before this?

442
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:21,414
You have a run-in
with any of these guys?

443
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:23,484
No, not really.

444
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:26,361
Just stopped for gas
and directions.

445
00:36:28,466 --> 00:36:31,026
(Sniffs)

446
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:33,970
Ma'am, is this your
marijuana cigarette?

447
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:37,600
Um, no.

448
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:40,270
One of the boys
must have left it.

449
00:36:42,046 --> 00:36:45,140
You mean to tell me one
of them guys is wearing lipstick?

450
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,917
This ain't the big city.

451
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:52,479
Please, I may have smoked a joint,

452
00:36:52,524 --> 00:36:54,617
but that doesn't mean
that I made any of this up.

453
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:58,526
This is Storch.
I知 at Mockingbird cabin.

454
00:36:58,563 --> 00:37:01,828
- Gonna need some backup.
- Backup?

455
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:04,699
What could you possibly
need backup for? I知 the victim.

456
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:07,296
Ma'am, you've been drinking,

457
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:09,203
smoking marijuana cigarettes.

458
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,971
You got enough booze in here to put
the whole town three sheets to the wind.

459
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:16,208
You're running around in your sleeping
garments at the crack of dawn.

460
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:17,714
You gotta see this
from my point of view.

461
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:21,241
What? They came in here
and they assaulted me.

462
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:22,810
You have to believe me.

463
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:25,220
Ma'am, I知 just trying
to get to the bottom of this.

464
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:26,723
You're making serious accusations

465
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:29,352
about boys I致e known
since they was kids.

466
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:32,830
And you haven't been
altogether truthful now, have you?

467
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,528
Now please,
step up against the wall.

468
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:53,012
Shoulder width apart.

469
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:07,491
Ma'am, please.

470
00:38:07,532 --> 00:38:09,898
Look right ahead.

471
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,975
(Sniffs)

472
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:29,742
(gasps)

473
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:32,381
Now...

474
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:35,824
I want the whole story.

475
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,760
You tell me the whole thing.

476
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:42,896
You start by telling me
what those boys did.

477
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:45,425
Tell the sheriff the truth,
show horse.

478
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:53,233
Better yet,
why don't you show him?

479
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,776
Show him how that pretty little mouth
of yours couldn't get enough

480
00:39:00,818 --> 00:39:03,446
- as far as I recall.
- Is that right?

481
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:11,358
(Johnny coughs)

482
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,432
They do this?

483
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:28,610
Nice little tits.

484
00:39:28,646 --> 00:39:30,637
(Sobbing)

485
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:39,781
(groans)

486
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:42,054
I asked you a question.

487
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:48,163
Please.

488
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,967
Johnny: You show the sheriff
your teeth there, show horse.

489
00:39:53,004 --> 00:39:54,437
(Clicks tongue)
Come on.

490
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,768
- Come on, move.

Besides, she's bleeding as all hell.
Wonder if the bitch got messed up.

653
00:50:25,669 --> 00:50:28,433
Andy: Yeah, right. We all thought
Matthew was gonna

654
00:50:28,472 --> 00:50:30,736
be the pussy today, huh?

655
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:33,572
Johnny: Don't know what
you're bragging about, Andy.

656
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,408
Clocked you
just over two minutes.

657
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:38,176
Andy:
It's been a while, man.

658
00:50:38,215 --> 00:50:39,876
I知 out of practice.

659
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:43,045
It痴 been, I don't know,
maybe 10 years.

660
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:45,448
Where you going?

661
00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:48,049
God damn,
she's got some fight in her.

662
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:50,083
(Whimpering)

663
00:52:18,182 --> 00:52:19,809
Johnny:
Come on, let's chase.

664
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:23,081
Andy:
Where does she think she's going?

665
00:52:24,855 --> 00:52:27,847
(Laughing)

666
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:43,563
Well, it was fun
while it lasted, Miss Hills.

667
00:52:44,775 --> 00:52:46,766
(Heart beating)

668
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:58,512
Johnny: Shit!

669
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:05,457
Johnny:
Where is she?

670
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:10,323
Hell, she's gotta
come up for air sometime.

671
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:12,562
Shit.

672
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,148
Stanley: Gators must have
got her by now. Right, Sheriff?

673
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:35,185
Listen up.

674
00:53:35,225 --> 00:53:38,251
Creek ends about six miles
downstream in Watson.

675
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:41,287
Between here and there,
we're gonna find her.

676
00:53:41,331 --> 00:53:44,027
We split up.
We check the banks,

677
00:53:44,067 --> 00:53:45,500
in the timber, under rocks.

678
00:53:45,536 --> 00:53:48,198
Hell, you see a hole big enough
for her, I want you in there.

679
00:53:48,238 --> 00:53:51,503
And do not stop till y'all
find me a dead city whore.

680
00:54:08,825 --> 00:54:10,019
Nothing.

681
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:15,989
Not a goddamn thing.

682
00:54:30,247 --> 00:54:32,511
Now what?

683
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:35,541
Her body will show up one way
or another.

684
00:54:38,055 --> 00:54:40,387
Every day we're
gonna check the ravine,

685
00:54:40,424 --> 00:54:43,791
from the bridge
straight down through here and back.

686
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:45,727
Two shifts a day
till we find something.

687
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:47,320
For how long?

688
00:54:49,366 --> 00:54:52,494
Till I goddamn fucking say. Clear?

689
00:54:55,739 --> 00:54:58,367
Andy, you get on back to the cabin.
Clean her shit up.

690
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:01,309
Burn it, all of it.
You hear me?

691
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:04,007
Yes sir.

692
00:55:04,047 --> 00:55:05,912
You get her wheels
down the shop.

693
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:08,213
Strip it down to its
last goddamn nut.

694
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:10,082
That's gonna take two weeks.

695
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:17,123
All right, Sheriff, yeah.

696
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,321
I値l have Andy torch it out

697
00:55:19,363 --> 00:55:21,490
and I値l rub the numbers out.

698
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:22,862
(Beeps)

699
00:55:29,306 --> 00:55:31,137
Asshole!

700
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:34,405
The fuck you saving that for,
you moron?

701
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:36,742
It痴 fucking evidence!

702
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:41,713
I shit you not!

703
00:55:52,629 --> 00:55:54,961
(Breathing heavily)

704
00:55:57,801 --> 00:56:00,395
I need you all on point
for this.

705
00:56:00,437 --> 00:56:03,304
And I mean goddamn
fucking point.

706
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,070
We clear?

707
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:10,277
Now pony up.

708
00:56:10,313 --> 00:56:12,781
We got shit to do.

709
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:15,444
Burn that effing tape.

710
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,417
Andy:
Well, that's all of it,

711
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:25,087
right down
to her little titty sling.

712
00:56:34,337 --> 00:56:38,068
Man, this fire's
making me hungry.

713
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:40,076
Well, there's a headline.

714
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,578
We gotta finish this shit.

715
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:45,137
We gotta get that car
in the garage.

716
00:56:45,182 --> 00:56:48,151
Then you can stuff your face
till you puke.

717
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:53,512
Where the hell's Matthew at?

718
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:56,788
He ain't one
to stay behind.

719
00:56:56,827 --> 00:57:00,786
He was looking around the water like
some crazed dog after a bone, man.

720
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:03,698
You keep an eye on him.

721
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:05,793
We gotta make sure
he keeps it together, you hear me?

722
00:57:07,404 --> 00:57:09,395
Just at least until
this shit's over.

723
00:57:34,898 --> 00:57:36,889
(Sighs)

724
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:50,076
Gone all day,
I got nervous.

725
00:57:50,113 --> 00:57:52,980
- Anything worth telling?
- Just the usual.

726
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:56,417
The mess they got on Highway 1
took forever.

727
00:57:56,453 --> 00:57:57,920
- Daddy.
- How's my angel?

728
00:57:57,954 --> 00:57:59,421
Daddy.

729
00:57:59,456 --> 00:58:01,117
Got anything on the stove?

730
00:58:01,158 --> 00:58:04,321
Sure, I値l reheat it.
You'll be proud.

731
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:06,352
Proud of what?

732
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:12,701
I was accepted
to the honors program, Daddy.

733
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:16,272
- Can you believe it?
- Of course I can.

734
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:18,797
I expect nothing less
from my angel.

735
00:58:18,842 --> 00:58:21,606
Mommy and I are
proud of you.

736
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,348
I知 gonna shower up.

737
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:46,025
(Bell rings)

738
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:54,502
Every time I come in here
this place gets worse.

739
00:58:54,544 --> 00:58:56,774
Yeah,
and business keeps getting

740
00:58:56,813 --> 00:58:58,906
better and better.

741
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:10,518
Mockingbird Trail.

742
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,925
Miss Hills.

743
00:59:11,962 --> 00:59:14,157
She left?

744
00:59:14,197 --> 00:59:16,392
She did indeed.

745
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:19,231
I couldn't make head
nor tail of it.

746
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:22,204
I found empty cases of booze,

747
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,332
marijuana cigarettes.

748
00:59:24,374 --> 00:59:25,568
Crazy wild one.

749
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:27,770
She'd have made
a preacher cuss.

750
00:59:27,811 --> 00:59:30,803
- My lucky day.
- Why's that?

751
00:59:30,847 --> 00:59:33,281
No refund policy.

752
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:35,944
Christmas come early.

753
00:59:35,986 --> 00:59:37,817
Enjoy it.

754
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:41,991
Speaking of early,
next month's quail season.

755
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:43,652
I don't know about you,

756
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:46,856
but I知 getting tired
of shooting squirrels.

757
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:49,957
Me too.

758
01:00:06,816 --> 01:00:09,148
(Screaming)

759
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:25,124
- Woman: Thank you.
- Johnny: You have a pretty smile.

760
01:00:25,168 --> 01:00:28,331
Did you just come here
to see me?

761
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:30,339
Happy hour, boys.

762
01:00:30,373 --> 01:00:33,706
Fuckin' A.
Here's to your mama.

763
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:41,644
I just want all this bullshit
to be over.

764
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:58,256
(Screaming)

765
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:11,971
(rubber band snapping)

766
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:20,881
No!

767
01:01:20,924 --> 01:01:22,915
(Gasping)

768
01:01:38,141 --> 01:01:40,541
(shouting)

769
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,650
(laughing on TV)

770
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:56,625
Woman: He's the big black guy
in the red drawstring.

771
01:01:56,659 --> 01:01:58,559
Man:
You're talking about the garbage man.

772
01:01:58,595 --> 01:02:00,256
Woman:
Well, give the man a turkey.

773
01:02:00,296 --> 01:02:02,287
(Telephone rings)

774
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,960
- Hello.
- Earl: Yeah.

775
01:02:07,003 --> 01:02:10,404
It痴 Earl.

776
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,101
- Earl.
- Yeah.

777
01:02:12,142 --> 01:02:15,111
This woman leaves a message
on the machine.

778
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:16,578
Barbara something or other.

779
01:02:16,613 --> 01:02:18,308
Yeah, so?

780
01:02:18,348 --> 01:02:21,078
She was asking
about that Miss Hills.

781
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:23,847
Says no one's seen her
in over a month.

782
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:26,879
Ain't that about the time
she split?

783
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:29,187
Yeah.

784
01:02:29,225 --> 01:02:31,284
Yeah, and you know the story.

785
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:34,194
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

786
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,256
I think you should
call her back.

787
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,860
I mean, heck, Sheriff,

788
01:02:39,903 --> 01:02:42,030
you may have been
the last one to see her.

789
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:47,605
Sheriff?

790
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:50,306
Okay, I値l call her.

791
01:02:50,346 --> 01:02:52,678
Good.
You want the number?

792
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:56,276
No, it's late.

793
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,810
I値l get it from you
in the AM.

794
01:03:01,691 --> 01:03:03,090
We're still on
for tomorrow, right?

795
01:03:03,126 --> 01:03:05,617
Yeah, of course.

796
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:07,562
(Beeps)

797
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:11,033
Everything all right?

798
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:13,535
Yeah, just fine.

799
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,561
(Rock music playing)

800
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:22,838
It痴 gone!

801
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,676
Look at that.

802
01:03:24,714 --> 01:03:26,705
Looks like someone
spooked the cattle.

803
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:28,717
(Andy laughing)

804
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:30,582
(burps)

805
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:32,952
(panting)
It痴 gone!

806
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,616
It痴 fucking gone!

807
01:03:34,657 --> 01:03:36,921
Jesus, Stanley,
calm the fuck down.

808
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,450
What's got your nuts
in a sling?

809
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,430
My camera, it's gone.
Someone stole it.

810
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:44,126
Maybe you accidentally ate it.

811
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:46,658
Fuck off, man,
this is serious!

812
01:03:50,073 --> 01:03:51,665
It had the tape in it.

813
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:53,835
What are you talking about?

814
01:03:53,877 --> 01:03:55,936
The tape.

815
01:03:55,979 --> 01:03:58,106
The fucking tape.

816
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:02,213
The tape Storch smashed to bits?
That tape?

817
01:04:02,252 --> 01:04:04,379
Oh, man,
Storch didn't smash shit.

818
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,183
I replaced it
with a new one.

819
01:04:06,222 --> 01:04:10,056
The Sheriff stomped
on the one that had nothing on it.

820
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:17,561
You kept that tape, huh?

821
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,329
You kept that tape,
you stupid piece of shit?

822
01:04:19,369 --> 01:04:21,929
Come here.
You kept that tape?

823
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:24,462
- You kept that fucking tape?
- Please, Andy!

824
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:27,374
- Hey hey hey!
- What's wrong with you?

825
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:30,072
- How could you lose that fucking tape?
- Come on, man.

826
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:31,808
Come on.

827
01:04:31,848 --> 01:04:34,408
Gotta stick together
on this one.

828
01:04:35,618 --> 01:04:37,586
You're too dumb to know
how dumb you are.

829
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:39,451
- (Coughing)
- You know that?

830
01:04:41,925 --> 01:04:45,554
(Panting)

831
01:04:45,595 --> 01:04:47,992
(coughs)

832
01:04:48,027 --> 01:04:50,390
(TV playing)

833
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:57,162
(loud bang)

834
01:05:19,095 --> 01:05:22,121
(laughs)

835
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:23,826
Uh-huh.

836
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:26,562
Is that right?

837
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:30,797
Is that right?

838
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:43,110
I better not find you,
you little fucker.

839
01:05:58,034 --> 01:05:59,365
(Loud bang)

840
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:15,639
All right.
All right, let's go.

841
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:18,552
Come on out, fucker.

842
01:06:18,588 --> 01:06:20,988
Come on!

843
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:22,685
You think this shit's funny?

844
01:06:28,464 --> 01:06:30,830
Andy?

845
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:34,460
Stanley?

846
01:06:38,775 --> 01:06:40,868
Fucking pussies.

847
01:06:42,278 --> 01:06:45,406
All right. All right.

848
01:07:12,909 --> 01:07:14,900
(Loud bang)

849
01:07:14,944 --> 01:07:17,913
That's it, God damn it.

850
01:07:17,947 --> 01:07:21,110
Yeah, come on!
Come on! Come on!

851
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:24,085
Yeah!
Come on, fucker!

852
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,851
- Come on out, fucker.
- (Dog barking)

853
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:32,292
- Oh shit.
- (Rustling)

854
01:07:35,031 --> 01:07:37,591
Come on.
Come on.

855
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:39,624
Come on. Come on.

856
01:07:55,218 --> 01:07:57,413
Son of a bitch.

857
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:05,422
Sweetheart.

858
01:08:08,698 --> 01:08:10,632
They're beautiful.

859
01:08:11,868 --> 01:08:13,665
I致e been so busy.

860
01:08:13,703 --> 01:08:16,433
No need to explain.

861
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:19,498
You hadn't taken a single day off.
You're only human.

862
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:20,975
I guess.

863
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,478
Maybe you can help me with something
while I put these in water.

864
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:25,003
Help with what?

865
01:08:25,047 --> 01:08:28,039
I got this tape delivered,
but it don't fit our machine.

866
01:08:28,084 --> 01:08:29,984
What tape?

867
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:32,681
It came this morning.
I think it's Chastity's recital.

868
01:08:38,995 --> 01:08:40,895
Chastity see this?

869
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:43,831
No. Like I said,
we couldn't get it to play.

870
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:46,596
Where is she?

871
01:08:46,636 --> 01:08:48,627
She's sleeping. Why?

872
01:08:51,574 --> 01:08:53,565
I知 gonna be back.

873
01:09:05,688 --> 01:09:07,679
Where the hell you been?

874
01:09:07,723 --> 01:09:11,215
Beauty queen over here
doing his hair for two hours.

875
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,627
What's this all about, man?

876
01:09:14,664 --> 01:09:16,598
- Where'd you get that?
- Where'd I get that?

877
01:09:16,632 --> 01:09:18,930
Right there.
That's where I got that.

878
01:09:18,968 --> 01:09:21,266
Somebody left me a present
last night on my doorstep.

879
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:24,501
Jesus, man, Matthew!
Come on!

880
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,531
- You boys seen him?
- No, man.

881
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:29,511
- (Tires screeching)
- No one knows where he's at.

882
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:34,812
- Oh shit!
- This shit ain't good.

883
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:43,889
What?

884
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:46,855
I didn't do anything, Sheriff.

885
01:09:46,896 --> 01:09:49,922
You wanna tell me why
this was dropped off to my house?

886
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:53,863
To my wife!

887
01:09:53,903 --> 01:09:55,894
(Groaning)

888
01:09:58,107 --> 01:10:01,975
What's on the tape?
Is this some kind of fucked up joke?

889
01:10:02,011 --> 01:10:04,138
I smashed the damn thing myself!

890
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,946
No, Sheriff.
Genius there reloaded the camera.

891
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:10,282
The one you smashed
ain't got nothing on it.

892
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:12,719
You knew about this?

893
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:15,986
No, Sheriff,
I just found out about it myself.

894
01:10:16,025 --> 01:10:19,324
- Eat that tape, fat boy!
- (Grunting)

895
01:10:19,362 --> 01:10:22,525
- Fucking tape!
- (Andy laughing)

896
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:24,294
You think it's funny?

897
01:10:26,736 --> 01:10:29,762
You screwed up, fat boy.

898
01:10:29,805 --> 01:10:32,239
Sheriff.
It was Matthew, Sheriff.

899
01:10:32,275 --> 01:10:34,709
I mean, dipshit there,
he kept the tape as a souvenir,

900
01:10:34,744 --> 01:10:36,575
but Matthew's the one
that took it, Sheriff.

901
01:10:36,612 --> 01:10:39,775
Look at this. Silly bastard
left me a present last night.

902
01:10:39,815 --> 01:10:42,010
Andy:
He's obsessed with her, man.

903
01:10:44,186 --> 01:10:46,746
I think he even
feels guilty.

904
01:10:46,789 --> 01:10:49,952
You dipshits bring him to me.

905
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:53,762
I知 gonna cut
his retard pecker off

906
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:55,787
and use it as a goddamn
hood ornament.

907
01:10:55,831 --> 01:10:58,197
That's before I知 done shoving it
up your dirt hole.

908
01:10:58,234 --> 01:11:00,134
Shit, we've been looking
for him, Sheriff.

909
01:11:00,169 --> 01:11:02,103
Trust me, we've been
everywhere looking for him.

910
01:11:04,173 --> 01:11:06,164
(Coughs)

911
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,951
I want him found tonight.

912
01:11:21,357 --> 01:11:22,915
Or I swear to Christ,

913
01:11:22,959 --> 01:11:25,985
I値l bring the wrath of God
down on you.

914
01:11:37,206 --> 01:11:38,935
(Car starts)

915
01:11:56,826 --> 01:11:59,090
(gunshot)

916
01:12:01,497 --> 01:12:03,965
Can you believe there used
to be a limit on quail?

917
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,436
Goddamn things
are like locusts now.

918
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,836
Much to our good fortune.

919
01:12:12,074 --> 01:12:14,440
I gotta take a break.

920
01:12:14,477 --> 01:12:17,037
My dogs are barking
something fierce.

921
01:12:20,983 --> 01:12:22,974
I remember when you and my old man
chased that buck

922
01:12:23,019 --> 01:12:26,045
out from the hollows
on Stickler Farm before bagging it.

923
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:30,622
Aww. Them were
the good old days.

924
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,561
To the good old days.

925
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:37,191
Well, fancy.
To what do I owe?

926
01:12:37,233 --> 01:12:38,564
You just enjoy it.

927
01:12:45,775 --> 01:12:48,642
This is some fine whiskey.

928
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:54,538
Usually you don't get
something like this except at baptisms

929
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:57,051
- and weddings.
- (Gun cocks)

930
01:12:57,086 --> 01:12:59,418
- And funerals.
- (Gunshot)

931
01:13:00,423 --> 01:13:02,414
(gurgles)

932
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:08,562
Loose ends, Earl.

933
01:13:12,668 --> 01:13:14,863
Loose ends.

934
01:13:14,904 --> 01:13:16,895
(Gunshot)

935
01:13:33,355 --> 01:13:36,222
- Jennifer: Matthew.
- (Gasps)

936
01:13:38,694 --> 01:13:41,424
I知 over here.

937
01:13:48,037 --> 01:13:50,028
Jennifer:
Matthew.

938
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:56,334
- Matthew.
- (Gasping)

939
01:14:15,798 --> 01:14:17,789
(wood creaking)

940
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:29,868
I- I knew-
knew you were alive.

941
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:33,139
I knew it.

942
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:35,707
How did you know, Matthew?

943
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:37,981
Huh?

944
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:40,580
How did you know
I was alive?

945
01:14:40,623 --> 01:14:44,184
Are you sure
you're not dreaming?

946
01:14:46,829 --> 01:14:48,626
Am I?

947
01:14:48,664 --> 01:14:50,564
Am I dreaming?

948
01:14:50,599 --> 01:14:52,965
Come here.

949
01:14:53,002 --> 01:14:54,833
Sit with me.

950
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:08,939
(Stammers)
I need to tell you-

951
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:11,578
Shh!

952
01:15:13,956 --> 01:15:17,619
I know, Matthew.

953
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:19,890
I know this wasn't your fault.

954
01:15:22,398 --> 01:15:24,366
You tried to help me.

955
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,197
I did.

956
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:30,228
I really really did.

957
01:15:33,008 --> 01:15:34,839
And- and-

958
01:15:34,877 --> 01:15:37,004
and you're okay.

959
01:15:37,046 --> 01:15:41,039
You're- you're okay.

960
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:45,076
Yes, Matthew.

961
01:15:48,324 --> 01:15:49,916
Now come.

962
01:15:54,964 --> 01:15:56,955
Come on.

963
01:15:56,999 --> 01:15:58,466
It痴 okay.

964
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:02,838
It痴 okay.

965
01:16:02,872 --> 01:16:06,808
- I知 sorry.
- Shh. Come on.

966
01:16:06,842 --> 01:16:09,936
I知 so sorry.
(Crying)

967
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:19,712
Oh God!

968
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:29,822
I知 so sorry.

969
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:31,628
Matthew.

970
01:16:35,638 --> 01:16:38,072
- Matthew.
- Yeah.

971
01:16:38,107 --> 01:16:40,041
- Matthew, look at me.
- Yeah.

972
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,345
Tell me again
how sorry you are.

973
01:16:46,382 --> 01:16:49,044
(Choking)

974
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:54,412
(gasping)

975
01:17:06,835 --> 01:17:09,895
I知- I知- I知 sorry.

976
01:17:12,574 --> 01:17:15,372
It痴 just not good enough!

977
01:17:20,716 --> 01:17:23,207
(Matthew choking)

978
01:17:24,386 --> 01:17:26,956
Stanley:
Matthew!

979
01:17:31,727 --> 01:17:33,820
Matthew!

980

a little kiss?

1149
01:33:45,366 --> 01:33:47,891
Hmm? Hmm?

1150
01:33:47,936 --> 01:33:49,995
Let's go, come on.

1151
01:33:50,038 --> 01:33:53,405
I don't take orders
from no fucking woman.

1152
01:33:53,441 --> 01:33:55,170
No?

1153
01:33:56,411 --> 01:33:59,039
(Gagging)

1154
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,446
Breathe through your nose.

1155
01:34:01,482 --> 01:34:03,814
Breathe through your nose.
Come on.

1156
01:34:03,851 --> 01:34:06,081
Just like it was
your first time, remember?

1157
01:34:07,889 --> 01:34:09,720

01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:34,171
Let me tell you something:

1164
01:34:34,215 --> 01:34:37,013
You know,

1165
01:34:37,051 --> 01:34:40,077

a good blowjob.

1166
01:34:40,121 --> 01:34:42,385
(Laughing)

1167
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:47,320
No.

1168
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:50,925
You know what they do to horses

1169
01:34:50,965 --> 01:34:52,899
that can't be tamed, Johnny?

1170
01:34:57,305 --> 01:34:59,205

1172
01:35:04,612 --> 01:35:06,477
No teeth, show horse.

1173
01:35:06,514 --> 01:35:08,573
No teeth.

1174
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:14,383

No, from the honors program.

1182
01:36:20,721 --> 01:36:24,020

01:36:30,898 --> 01:36:32,991
Daddy's real busy working.

1186
01:36:33,034 --> 01:36:34,797
But I really want you
to meet my new teacher.

1187
01:36:36,504 --> 01:36:38,028
She's way cool.

1188
01:36:40,041 --> 01:36:42,271
Here. Just say hi.

1189
01:36:45,012 --> 01:36:46,809
Howdy, Sheriff.

1190
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:49,043
It痴 truly an honor

1191
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:50,983
to speak with you, Miss...

1192
01:36:51,018 --> 01:36:53,350
Hills, Jennifer Hills.

1193
01:36:53,387 --> 01:36:56,322
(Tires screech)

1194
01:36:57,625 --> 01:36:59,855
Excuse me?

1195
01:36:59,894 --> 01:37:02,863
I have to tell you it's been
a pleasure meeting your family.

1196
01:37:02,897 --> 01:37:05,263
You have a wonderful daughter

1197
01:37:05,299 --> 01:37:08,097
with a bright
and promising future.

1198
01:37:09,704 --> 01:37:12,332
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1199
01:37:12,373 --> 01:37:14,136
We'll see you soon, Sheriff.

(Tires squeal)

1204
01:37:46,874 --> 01:37:48,171
Chastity, where is she?

1205
01:37:48,209 --> 01:37:49,506
She went to Hanson Park
with Miss Hills.

1206
01:37:49,544 --> 01:37:52,513
She wanted to get to know her students
in the program before the year st-

1207
01:37:52,547 --> 01:37:54,412
God damn it!

1208
01:37:54,448 --> 01:37:55,745
Who is she?

1209
01:37:58,152 --> 01:37:59,881
Who is this woman?

1210
01:38:22,677 --> 01:38:24,668
Chastity!

1211
01:38:31,285 --> 01:38:33,412

Help me, Jesus.

1221
01:39:47,928 --> 01:39:50,192
Does that hurt, Sheriff?

1222
01:39:50,231 --> 01:39:52,665
(Grunting)

1223
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:55,692
Come on,
I thought you were an ass man.

1224
01:39:55,736 --> 01:39:58,728
Where is she, you bitch?

1225
01:40:00,241 --> 01:40:01,833
(Groaning)

1226
01:40:01,876 --> 01:40:05,710
I壇 be real careful
how you talk to me right now, Sheriff.

1227
01:40:05,746 --> 01:40:08,772
What have you done to her?

1228
01:40:11,952 --> 01:40:14,512
By her, I assume
you mean your daughter?

1229
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,558
She really is lovely, Sheriff.

1230
01:40:21,529 --> 01:40:24,396
So young.

1231

So sweet.

1232
01:40:27,868 --> 01:40:30,336
So innocent.

1233
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:37,867
I mean, can you imagine?

1234
01:40:37,912 --> 01:40:39,880
Imagine what?

1235
01:40:45,086 --> 01:40:47,782
Imagine that somebody
had done something

1236
01:40:47,822 --> 01:40:50,882
like this to her.

1237
01:40:50,925 --> 01:40:53,223
(Grunting)

1238
