The glass of wine or the whole

540
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,385
And you know that I am.
The glass of wine or the whole
damn decanter.

541
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:35,552
The glass of wine or the whole
damn decanter.
Now, it seems to me that the

542
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:38,689
Damn decanter.
Now, it seems to me that the
wine is... That's pretty simple,

543
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,524
Now, it seems to me that the
wine is... That's pretty simple,
isn't it?

544
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,660
Wine is... That's pretty simple,

But the scotch.

545
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:48,098
Isn't it?
But the scotch.
Well, we could consider that a,

546
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,902
But the scotch.
Well, we could consider that a,
a momentary lapse to...

547
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:55,906
Well, we could consider that a,

trivia contest, nor is it a test

564
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,410
>> well, it is not a quiz or a
trivia contest, nor is it a test
of brute strength or

565
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,145
Trivia contest, nor is it a test
of brute strength or
athleticism.

566
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,646
Of brute strength or
athleticism.
At its core, it's just a

567
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:11,115
Athleticism.
At its core, it's just a
children's game, and I would

568
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:13,484
At its core, it's just a
children's game, and I would
wager that some of you here this

569
00:29:13,486 --> 00:29:16,086
Children's game, and I would
wager that some of you here this
evening have played "would you

570
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:20,357
Wager that some of you here this
evening have played "would you
rather?" at some point.

571
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:24,828
Evening have played "would you
rather?" at some point.
So, how do we play?

572
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,965
Rather?" at some point.
So, how do we play?
In each round, each player

573
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,933
So, how do we play?
In each round, each player
will be given a choice between

574
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:34,338
In each round, each player
will be given a choice between
"a" or "b", uh, and usually, uh,

575
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,939
Will be given a choice between
"a" or "b", uh, and usually, uh,
neither choice is very

576
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:36,940
"a" or "b", uh, and usually, uh,
neither choice is very
attractive.

577
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,108
Neither choice is very
attractive.
Let's see if I can give you

578
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,278
Attractive.
Let's see if I can give you
an example: Travis.

579
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,381
Let's see if I can give you
an example: Travis.
Travis, would you rather...

580
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:49,253
An example: Travis.
Travis, would you rather...
Kiss iris or peter?

581
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:50,788
Travis, would you rather...
Kiss iris or peter?
[scattered chuckling]

582
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,722
Kiss iris or peter?
[scattered chuckling]
[chuckles]

583
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:53,490
[scattered chuckling]
[chuckles]
>> guess I'd kiss iris.

584
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,458

>> guess I'd kiss iris.
>> very good.

585
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,361
>> guess I'd kiss iris.
>> very good.
Now, this is where our version

586
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:58,862
>> very good.
Now, this is where our version
of the game is different.

587
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:02,199
Now, this is where our version
of the game is different.
Whatever you choose, you <i>must</i>

588
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:05,235
Of the game is different.
Whatever you choose, you <i>must</i>
<i>act upon, so in this case,</i>

589
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:08,372
Whatever you choose, you <i>must</i>
<i>act upon, so in this case,</i>
<i>travis, you must walk over and</i>

590
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:10,207
<i>Act upon, so in this case,</i>

591
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:11,241

You just gotta look for the
patterns.
It's all patterns,

1335
01:10:39,202 --> 01:10:43,338
Patterns.
It's all patterns,
it's psychology.

1336

And drowning does sound
pretty bad.
So, I'm guessing you think

01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:50,845
So, I'm guessing you think
I'm gonna choose the envelope to
avoid "duggins" holding me

1341
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:51,813
I'm gonna choose the envelope to
avoid "duggins" holding me
underwater for two minutes and

1342
01:10:51,815 --> 01:10:54,515
Avoid "duggins" holding me
underwater for two minutes and
drowning, is that it?

1343
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:55,683
Underwater for two minutes and
drowning, is that it?

If you were facing a normal

If you were facing a normal
player, that's exactly what

1347

If you were facing a normal
player, that's exactly what
you'd do.

1348
01:11:02,392 --> 01:11:03,458
Player, that's exactly what
you'd do.
Put something really shitty in

1349
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,593
You'd do.
Put something really shitty in
that envelope, so all the other

1350
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,763
Put something really shitty in
that envelope, so all the other
players think twice.

1351
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:09,897
That envelope, so all the other
players think twice.
But I know you.

1352
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:11,232
Players think twice.
But I know you.
You've looked into my past.

1353
01:11:11,234 --> 01:11:12,233
But I know you.
You've looked into my past.
So you know all about my

You've looked into my past.
So you know all about my
gambling experience.

1355
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:16,838
So you know all about my
gambling experience.
So you probably have anticipated

1356
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,672
Gambling experience.
So you probably have anticipated
that I was gonna figure

Gambling 101.
Why are you pointing a gun in

Why are you pointing a gun in
