They're vivisecting a human being.

323

They're cutting a living man to pieces.

Now I know about his natives.

325

why you and your island...

stink from one end of the South Seas

What makes your natives
such monstrosities?

My dear young fool,
you're entirely mistaken.

Well, you can't get away with it
in my case, Moreau.

[Lock Turns]

384
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,692
I started with plant life
in London 20 years ago.

385
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,738
I took an orchid,
and upon it I performed a miracle.

386
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,993
I stripped a hundred thousand years
of slow evolution from it...

387
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,537
and I had no longer an orchid...

388
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:34,540
but what orchids will be
a hundred thousand years from now.

389
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,251
That's one there.

390
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,798
Yes, but how, Doctor?

391
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,593
[Laughs] By a slight change
in the single unit of a germ plasm.

392
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,678
It was as simple as that.

393
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,472
That's a common lily.

394
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,391
That's a chrysanthemum.

395
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,977
That's unfortunately
what happened to some asparagus.

[Laughing]

397
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,194
I went on with this research
just as it led me.

00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,988
I let my imagination run
fantastically ahead.

Man is the present climax
of a long process of organic revolution.

403
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:25,049
All animal life is tending
toward the human form.

404
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:29,011
[Laughs] I was still in London when l
began this phase of my experiments.

405
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,430
One day a dog escaped
from my laboratory...

406
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,683
ran shrieking into the street.

407
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,685
And I left London, Mr. Parker...

408
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,939
the newspapers at my heels,
an aroused England crying for my blood.

409
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,110
I picked up Montgomery
and brought him along.

410
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:47,738
He was a medical student facing a prison term
for a professional indiscretion.

411
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,119
That was 1 1 long years ago.

among the cellular organisms.

418
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,224
My work, my discoveries.

From the lower animals,

You're convinced that this thing
on the table isn't human.

00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,758
Its cries are human.

428
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,385
- You know what it is that I began with?
- No.

429
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,804
- An animal.
- An animal?

430
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,641
- Mm-hmm.
- Like those in the cages outside?

431
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:01,687
Then those - those creatures
out in the jungle?

432
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,522
Are my creations.

433
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,983
- They were made from animals?
- Yes.

434
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:11,030
Was this thing,
this poor, tortured creature -

435
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,616
What does that matter?

436
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,493
Of all things vile!

437
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,621
Mr. Parker, spare me
these youthful horrors, please.

438
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,374
And those -

439
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,918
those poor things
out there in the jungle -

440
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,045
those animals -

441
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,172
They - They talk.

442
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,716
That was my first
great achievement -

443
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:33,594
articulate speech
controlled by the brain.

444
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,138
That was an achievement.

445
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,101
Oh, it takes a long time
and infinite patience...

446
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,019
to make them talk.

447
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:48,401
[Chuckles] Someday,
I'll create a woman, and it'll be easier.

448
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,824
Those are some
of my less successful experiments.

449
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,744
They supply the power
to create others...

450
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:00,996
more successful.

451
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,085
But with each experiment,
I improve upon the last.

452
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,213
I get nearer and nearer.

453
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,965
Mr. Parker.

454
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,679
Do you know what it means
to feel like God?

[Chuckles]

456
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:23,018
I'm talking too much, aren't I?

457
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,360
- Good night, Mr. Parker.
- Good night.

458
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,487
- You know the way to your room?
- Yes, thanks.

00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,328
I hope you sleep well.

Thanks.

461
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,430
Good night.

462
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,566
Did you see that, Montgomery?
She was tender, like a woman.

463
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,404
How that little scene spurs
the scientific imagination onward.

464
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,745
I wonder how much of Lota's
animal origin is still alive...

465
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,917
how nearly a perfect woman she is.

466
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,005
It's possible I may find out...

467
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:37,760
with the aid of Mr. Parker.

468
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,430
You won't have much time
if he leaves for Apia in the morning.

469
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:47,728
Wouldn't it be a great loss to science
if he left for Apia in the morning?

470
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,194
[Montgomery]
Four with a fair wind.

- I want to thank you, Doctor, for -
- Not at all.

I'm only too happy
to have been of service to you.

473
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,784
Yes, but I do appreciate
what you're doing for -

474
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:10,125
Oh! Oh, this is most distressing.

475
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,963
I - I don't know what to say about it.
I can't account for it.

476
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,386
Unless, of course, the natives.
They were a bit out of hand last night.

00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,158
- Did you miss me?
- Did I miss ya?

00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,119
Pardon me. Excuse me, please.

483
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,038
Didn't you have a Mr. Parker on board?

484
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,498
- Parker?
- Yes.

485
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,750
Oh. You better talk to the skipper.

486
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:52,835
Let's go.

487
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,797
Now, men, stay sober.

488
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,216
Any drinking to be done,
I'll do it myself.

489
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,759
- [Man] Okay, Captain!
- [Men Laughing]

490
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,595
And if you get in a fight,
send for me.

[Men Chattering]

492
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,515
- Oh, Captain.
- Hello there, baby.

493
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,976
Captain, didn't you have
a Mr. Parker on board?

494
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,769
- Parker?
- Yes.

495
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,563
No.

496
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,189
But won't I do?

497
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,066
Didn't you rescue him
from the Lady Vain?

498
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,068
He sent me a wireless from your ship.

499
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,530
Oh, yes. He got off
at my first port of call.

500
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:23,115
At what port?

501
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,950
That's my business.

502
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:29,204
Maybe the American consul
will make it his business.

503
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,957
Well, give the consul my regards.

504
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,921
You knew this man wanted
to come to Apia, didn't you?

505
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,299
Well, I rescued him at sea
and dropped him off at my first port of call.

506
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,885
- That's all that's required of me, sir.
- What port?

507
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,638
- Well, it was an island, sir.
- What island?

508
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:49,808
Latitude 1 5 degrees south
and longitude 1 70 west, sir.

509
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,606
1 -5 south, 1 -7-0 west.

510
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,734
It's very small, sir.
You won't find it on the charts.

511
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,528
Then it isn't a port.

512
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,782
Well, it's an island, sir.
I dropped some cargo there.

513
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,367
Oh, I see.

514
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,370
That'll be all for the present.

515
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,163
Yes, sir.

516
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,458
If I find any irregularity in this,
I'll have your license revoked.

517
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,668
Yes, sir.

518
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,753
You wouldn't like that, would you?

519
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,297
- No, sir.
- I didn't think you would.

520
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:21,715
Yes, sir.

521

[Door Closes]

522
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:27,096
- Yes, sir!
- [Consul] How are you, Captain?

523
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,889
Miss Thomas, this is Captain Donahue.

524
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,516
- How do you do?
- How do you do, miss?

525
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,851
- When will you be ready to sail?
- I'm ready now, sir.

526
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,145
You'll find Donahue's boat perfectly safe,
but not very comfortable.

527
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,730
I've worked it all over.

528
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,273
Are you clear on the position?

529
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,693
Yes - 1 5 south and 1 70 west.

530
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:41,944
Okay.

531
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,238
- Well, good luck.
- Thank you.

532
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,533
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all.

533
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,660
Very glad to be of service to you.

534
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,525
Lota.

535
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,318
You startled me.

536
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,577
You're a strange child.

537
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,832
Talk to me.

538
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,501
Not now.

539
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,963
Talk to me.

540
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,971
Lota, do you know what this is?

541
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,182
- Book.
- Yes. Book.

542
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,267
From Dr. Moreau's library.

543
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,896
About electricity -
wireless telegraphy, radio...

544
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,981
how to build a shortwave transmitter.

545
00:40:03,276 --> 00:40:06,445
Of course, you haven't the faintest idea
what I'm talking about, have you?

546
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,034
Talk to me more.

547
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,412
All right.

548
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:18,040
I'll tell you something
you will understand.

549
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:23,253
Lota, I must get away from this island.

Maybe book take me away.

[Parker]
Lota!

553
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,612
[Parker]
Why did you do that?

554
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,906
[Lota]
Book take you away.

555
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:55,744

556
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,247
I'm in love with someone else.

557
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,416
I should've told you.

558

- Moreau, you don't deserve to live!
- I beg your pardon?

562
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,928
Those creatures out there in the jungle
were horrible enough.

563
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,305
But to have created a thing
as tragic as that girl.

564
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,724
- [Tea Pouring]
- Lota?

565
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,142
Yes. Lota.

566
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:45,479
An animal with a woman's emotions -
a woman's heartbreak, a woman's suffering.

567
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,855
Oh, it's criminal!

568
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,609
Hmm. You're an amazingly
unscientific young man.

569
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,861
I could've overlooked those others.

570
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:55,197
I could've shown you
that much consideration.

571
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,782
But not now.

572
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,701
Now I'll expose you to the world
for what you really are, Moreau.

573
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:00,994
When are you leaving?

574
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,086
I think you'd better sit down
and make yourself comfortable.

575
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,515
- Would you care for a cup of tea?
- No, thank you.

Well, we may as well discuss this frankly
now that you know the facts.

577
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,737
Lota is my most nearly perfect creation.

578
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:38,865
I was thinking of taking her with me
as Exhibit "A"...

579
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,701
on a triumphal return to London.

580
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,956
I wanted to prove
how completely she was a woman -

581
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:49,918
whether she was capable of loving,
mating and having children.

582
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,966
She was afraid of Montgomery and myself.

583
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,262
Then you came.

584
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,391
Well, she was very much
attracted to you.

585
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:11,273
You can see, of course, the possibilities
that presented themselves.

586
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,904
I'll tell you this, Moreau!

587
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,365
You'll make arrangements for me
to leave this island somehow...

588
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,284
and as quickly as possible.

589
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,287
Or this great scientific work
you've been doing will stop.

How did he find out?
What did you say to him?

591
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,021
What did you do to let him know?

592
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,460
What is it, Moreau?

593
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,674
The stubborn beast flesh creeping back.

594
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:25,013
Well, it's no use, Montgomery.
I may as well quit.

595
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,600
Day by day, it creeps back.

I can see, Captain Donahue,
that you would be afraid of nothing.

But Mr. Parker had one experience
