Complete devastation.

90

Like when soldiers
don't just defeat their enemy,

you to share with us tonight.

at their own pace.

She knew which one was for what.

got off on some technicality.

in one of our little weep sessions.

Got something special for you.

167
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,051
Something special? (CHUCKLES)

168
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,601
I hope you've got a tennis bracelet
down your pants,

169
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,728
'cause there sure ain't nothing
special about your cock.

170
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,087
It is a cock, right?

171
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,601
It's not just like a little puffy pussy?

172
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,000
Back off, bitch.

173
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,646
Oh, is that the best you got?

174
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,929
You're never gonna get laid
with game like that, Chief.

175
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,283
Get a job and a nice car,

176
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,408
not that piece of shit
I see you driving around in.

177
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,928
If you want pussy,
you're gonna have to pay for it

178
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,368
'cause I really can't see anybody
fucking you for free.

179
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,770
(SCOFFS) Dykes.

180
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,605
It's a sad thing when a straight woman

181
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,684
would rather eat pussy
than fuck your sorry ass.

182
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,286
MEN: Ooh! Shit!

183
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,801
- (MEN LAUGHING)
- What the fuck was that, man?

184
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,769
Don't mind them.

185
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,287
Their cocks make them stupid.

186
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,046
It's true. I saw it in a documentary.

187
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,402
It sucks all the blood
from their brains.

188
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,324
The bigger their dicks,
the dumber they get.

189
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,608
He must be hung like a horse.

190
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,206
Come on, you're buying me a drink.

191
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,522
- I live right there.
- Where?

192
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,648
- On 14th.
- I'm on Elm.

193
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,167
No kidding?
We should scissor each other.

194
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,722
(LAUGHS) Shut up.

195
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,408
So Chief's dad owns some, like,
electronics franchise or something.

196
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,762
He's hardly an urban gangster.

197
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,161
Well, if it's an act, it scared me.

198
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,971
I mean, do they have mothers, sisters?

199
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,849
How do they learn to speak
to women like that?

200
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,571
You know what? I don't give a shit
how women are spoken to

201
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,769
or objectified by rap music lyrics
or whatever.

202
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,690
I mean, people got raped in palaces
where everybody spoke poetry.

203
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,525
I'd rather he talked to me
like that than pretend.

204
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,364
At least it's honest.
I mean, like, talking nice,

205
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,409
it is just, like, dressed-up bullshit.

206
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,607
Yeah.

207
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,649
- Like the do-gooders.
- Huh?

208
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,842
Oh, nothing. There's this guy at my work
who just wants to be friends.

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,571
Oh, yeah, he wants you to say hello
to his little friend.

210
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,128
- His very little friend, most likely.
- Yes.

211
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,521
No chance he's one of the good ones?

212
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,370
There are good ones?

213
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,927
Yeah, sure. And unicorns, too.
Haven't you heard?

214
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,082
- (LAUGHS)
- I'll tell you what.

215
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,528
He does put a hand on you,
you really ought to shank the bastard.

216
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,489
I mean, it's an office, right?
Grab one of those letter openers,

217
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,961
jab it in his inner thigh,
watch him bleed out.

218
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,884
That's graphic.

219
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,929
I'm sorry. I just say whatever.

220
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,560
I don't give a shit. I'm so sorry.

221
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,449
No, it's okay.

222
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,728
All that political correctness
is pretty irritating anyway.

223
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,881
Mm-hmm.

224
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,162
That group lady Lynne
is really hard to take.

225
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,721
She's a fucking idiot.

226
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,685
Everything with her
is healing and forgiveness.

227
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,609
I can't take that
turquoise Sedona bullshit.

228
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,881
You know, you want
to give these women hope?

229
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,724
Give them vengeance.

230
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,325
Yeah.

231
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,211
Well, I'm not sure
that fixes anything either.

232
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,691
It fixes them.

233
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,126
All these women
in abusive relationships,

234
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,328
they should be learning
how to poison soup.

235
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,887
Yes, but do you have any extreme views?

236
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,362
(LAUGHS) Look, I'm no angel.

237
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,921
I've done some weird shit
in the bedroom.

238
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,650
But that was consenting, you know?

239
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,041
When my ex came at me with his...

240
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,930
that was it.

241
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,565
I'm done.

242
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,324
I'm not kidding.
I'm not gonna be handled again.

243
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,881
Not by anybody.
I mean, you trust someone,

244
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,769
you let them in, they fuck you up.

245
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,167
Fuck that, you know?
And the cops won't help you.

246
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,049
Nobody will help you.
You have to do it yourself.

247
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,770
You have to walk out
and never look back.

248
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,921
And if that doesn't work,

249
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,844
you take a paring knife
and you fillet it like a fish.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,048
You pull the guts out
and you cut the fucking head off.

251
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,327
How you doing?

252
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,043
(DOG BARKING)

253
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,610
(CRACKLES)

254
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,203
- I'm so grateful for this group.
- Thank you, Kensly.

255
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,044
Want to get a beer after?

256
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,486
- Cassie.
- Sure.

257
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,369
Are you ready to share?

258
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,971
My parents got divorced
when I was seven.

259
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,920
My mom, she took it really hard.

260
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,005
And, you know, really.

261
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,410
Well, it was a big deal
when she met Ron.

262
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,565
You know, 'cause she'd been
so unhappy for so long

263
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,930
and now she was happy again
and everybody was, like, relieved.

264
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,249
And Ron was like this
big hero to everyone,

265
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,609
which I always thought was pretty shitty
when you think about it, you know?

266
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,324
So at first...

267
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,211
at first I didn't say anything,

268
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,489
like, when he started.

269
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,369
And, you know,
the weirdest thing about it

270
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,483
is that I still sometimes
think about it.

271
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,405
Like all twisted around and stuff.

272
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,722
Like I deserved it or something.

273
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,247
And because of that,

274
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,607
because I didn't say
something right away,

275
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,286
like that meant that I liked
it or something.

276
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,562
I don't know. It's dumb or whatever.

277
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,166
But that's just the way
I used to think about it.

278
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,811
- Are you kidding me?
- The guy still lives there.

279
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,122
How is that even possible?

280
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,329
Well, the stepdad Ron, he denied it.

281
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,528
And the mom never really believed

282
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,451
that anything happened
in the first place, so...

283
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,007
So she just has to live
with a guy who rapes her?

284
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,844
Mmm-hmm. And she's terrified...

285
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,401
terrified that her mom's
gonna find out about group.

286
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,608
She thinks she's smoking pot
with the neighbor.

287
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,000
How fucked up is that?

288
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,289
A teenager sneaking out
of the house for rape counseling.

289
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,805
Shitty rape counseling.

290
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,440
It's just what I'm always saying,
you know?

291
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,410
Give a woman a fish and she makes
dinner for her piece-of-shit husband.

292
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,210
Teach the woman to kill
the piece-of-shit husband,

293
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,805
and she never has to make dinner again.

294
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,321
A message of hope.
It's beautiful, really.

295
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,609
It's like an epidemic
of browbeaten women

296
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,331
too afraid to stand up
against abusive men.

297
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,084
I mean, that's family values for you.

298
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,811
Wives and daughters
trapped in little boxes

299
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,962
stacked side by side in neat little rows

300
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,010
with monsters in there
torturing them year after year.

301
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,730
That's the institution of marriage

302
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,962
that everybody
is so desperate to protect

303
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,602
where women are slaves
to pedophiles and wife-beaters.

304
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,525
That's the way some of them want it.

305
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,523
They get off on it.

306
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,490
Can only come if they're
getting the shit beat out of them.

307
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,927
That's the way mine is.

308
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,529
Yeah, we're gonna need some shots.

309
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,328
- He's drunk.
- Come on.

310
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,448
Oh, my God.

311
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,602
- (LAUGHING)
- He's so drunk.

He's like the fastest drunk
in the world.

I'm going down to Pits

to get Gloria to ask you,

492
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,522
but she's...
she's kind of scared of you.

493

- Scared of me?
- She's sensitive, you know?

494
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,649
- And I'm a bitch.
- Oh, no, no. I didn't say that.

I don't know how else to say this.

Our dear friend Marla Finch

has passed.

letting me come and talk

As most of you are already aware,

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,725
early this morning we did discover
the body of Miss Finch.

560
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,406
Now this is a homicide investigation.

561
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,564
I myself, I'm actually with SVU.

562
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,848
A special victims unit often assists...

563
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,367
I thought SVU dealt with rape crimes.

564
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,602
Well, we do deal with assaults, yes.

565
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,082
But SVU also assists
in homicide investigations

566
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,401
when there's issues of abuse.

567
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,085
Was she raped?

Now, I don't mean to offend
you, Officer McDylan.

- It's Detective.
- Okay, Detective.

This is a sacred circle.

573
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,406
It's a place of trust and I don't think
it's an appropriate venue

574
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,762
for you to be doing your... your...

575

whatever the hell
it is that you're doing right now.

Oscar, Detective McDylan
is an invited guest.

577
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,523
Well, I most certainly
did not invite him here, Lynne.

578
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,205
And I would not have invited him here.

for you to do so.

- I have the floor, sir.

- Okay, okay.

this is exactly what I was afraid of.

They don't care about the victims.

and cross their Ts.

You know, our friend is dead, sir.

She was smarter than that,
I'm telling you.

638
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
She would not have put herself
in some kind of a situation

00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,690
No, no, hey.

645
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,845
You should tell me.

646
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,287
I think you want to tell me, so...

647
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,806
She was a strong girl. Hard.

648
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,802
You think maybe she was into weird shit,
like, I don't know, rough sex?

649
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,200
No, that's not what I'm saying.

650
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,408
Okay.

651
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,401
- You guys were close?
- Yeah.

652
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,085
I mean, I don't know.

653
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,925
I liked her.

654
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,289
But I only knew her a few weeks.

655
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,531
We used to come here.

656
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,768
She made me feel strong.

657
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,404
- What?
- Nothing, I just...

658
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,244
I see this stuff all the time.

659
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,528
You know,
it's the strongest-seeming people,

660
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,523
the rock everyone leans on,
but at home...

661
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,524
No, she was strong.

662
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,085
She did not take any shit.

663
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,571
Except from her ex-boyfriend, right?

664
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,047
No, he attacked her and she left.

665
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,201
Yeah, the last time.

666
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,045
But there are a ton
of domestic abuse calls on her file.

667
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,884
And again, I didn't know your friend,

668
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,691
but, like I said, I see it all the time.

669
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,729
These guys, they have a way
of getting under a girl's skin

670
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:27,168
and they can't shake 'em.

671
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,091
(SIGHS) This guy is a real
piece of shit, though.

672
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,090
And I'll tell you something,
I'd be very surprised if it wasn't him.

673
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,287
I'm sorry, I'm... I shouldn't...

674
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,205
I can't really discuss any details.
You understand?

675
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,404
Listen, thank you so much
for taking the time to talk to me.

676
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,201
I appreciate it, and I'm really
sorry about your friend, I am.

677
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,522
I will do everything I can
to bring her some justice.

678
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,210
I promise you.

679
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,521
Thanks.

McDylan.

681
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,802
You don't bring her justice.
You bring it to him.

Well, if it isn't my favorite
damsel in distress.

685
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,250
Where's your dyke
in shining armor tonight?

686
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,051
What's the matter, sweetie?
She leave you for a real man?

687
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,123
Don't worry, I got what you need.

688
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,682
Chief will take care of you.

689

(MEN CHUCKLE)

We got her all scared.

694
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,801
I don't know if she was weak
and just very good at hiding it

695
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,885
or if she was outmaneuvered.

696
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,690
That's an interesting choice of word.

697
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,080
What do you mean by that?

698
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,726
Just that maybe things
didn't go as she planned.

699
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,611
Well, what do you think she had planned?

700
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,808
I don't know.

701

Not being dead.

702
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,764
She wasn't weak.

703
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,327
A history of abuse doesn't mean
she was some fucking loser

704
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,970
who brought it on herself.

705
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,646
Then what do you think it means?

706
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,886
Hey!

707
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,520
Why the fuck are you
always lurking out here?

708
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,887
I'm just walking to my desk.
What's the matter?

709
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,963
Nothing.

710
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,286
Wow.

He walked? How is it that he walked?

713
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,368
He's fucking guilty.
You said so yourself.

714
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,603
Okay, okay, listen.
I'm really sorry, okay?

715
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,165
These things are complicated

716
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,163
and unfortunately the good guys
don't always get to win.

Who are the good guys? You?

I'm not a lawyer. I'm not the DA.

719
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,602
So it's her own fault she was killed

720
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,808
because she was weak
or scared or stupid?

721
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,485
I don't know what happened. I don't.

722
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,244
I am truly sorry, okay?

723
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,169
I know there's nothing I can say
to make that any better.

I don't want you to say something.
I want you to do something.

Look, what can I do, Angela?

726
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,922
There is a system in place, okay?

727
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,684
And most of the time it actually works.

728
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,446
For who? Not for rape victims.

729
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,409
Not for my dead friend Marla.

Listen, you think he did it.
I think he did it.

731
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,564
But there is a burden of proof here.

732
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,370
And you want that, do you understand?

733
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,045
Otherwise someone could just
point their finger at you

734
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,440
and send you to jail
because they feel like it.

- He's guilty.
- What do you want me to say?

736
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,966
- They didn't fucking prove it.
- You didn't fucking prove it.

Okay, I didn't prove it.

738

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,291
Is this official police business
or are you stalking me?

806
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,125
Marla's ex-boyfriend
was murdered on Tuesday.

807
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,206
Somebody beat him to death
with a crowbar, amongst other things.

808
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,806
So what are you saying?
You think I did it?

809
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,486
(SIGHS) No, no.

810
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,170
But Bolton's definitely
gonna want to talk to you.

811
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,004
- Who's Bolton?
- Lead homicide.

812
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,130
- It's her investigation.
- What do I have to do with anything?

813
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,806
Well, you did come on pretty strong
when he got out, right? So...

814
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,610
So now I'm a murder suspect?

815
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,683
She's gonna want to talk
to all Marla's friends.

816
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,320
I barely knew her.

817
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,608
Well, she didn't have very many
friends outside of group, so...

818
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,046
She didn't have any friends in group.

819
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,607
- She hated everybody.
- Except you.

820
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,364
Look, you said yourself
that this guy is a scumbag.

821
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,488
I mean, maybe it has nothing
to do with Marla at all.

822
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,881
No, the nature of the crime
suggests otherwise.

823
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,044
So what? I mean, he was murdered.

824
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,567
So was my friend.
And if there's no justice for her,

825
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,046
then why should there be any for him?

826
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,690
He was a piece of shit.

827
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,729
And to be honest,
I'm glad that somebody killed him.

828
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,770
Well, that's exactly what you don't
want to say in this situation, okay?

829
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,844
God damn it, you're more interested
in catching his killer

830
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,161
than you are in punishing hers.

831
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,129
Listen, you have to calm down, okay?

832
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,124
Or Bolton is gonna have
a field day with you, trust me.

833
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,960
Okay?

Thank you for telling me.
I appreciate it.

(BLOOD GUSHING)

968
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,604
Forgive me, Father,

969
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,286
for I don't give a shit.

970
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,327
Do you even want forgiveness?

971
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,004
Only people who are sorry
can be forgiven.

972
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,730
Are you sorry?

973
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,809
Don't you think that if you
get even with somebody,

974
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,043
then they have to get even with you
and the problem perpetuates itself?

975
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,281
Not always.

976
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,885
Like when?

977
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,768
Do you have any remorse
for what you've done?

978
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,844
Why should I?

979
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,562
Have you considered that
forgiveness might be a way

980
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,200
for you to release some of the anger
that you've been carrying around?

981
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,408
So am I forgiven?

982
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,006
Do you forgive yourself?

983
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,130
You're not responsible
for what happened to you.

984
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,171
Some people do bad things.
They make bad decisions.

985
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,322
Maybe somebody did bad things to them.

986
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,006
But the only way out is forgiveness.

987
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,003
I'll never forgive them.

988
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,481
They deserved to be punished.

989
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,365
But does that really help you heal?

990
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,246
Maybe not, but at least they got
what they deserved.

991
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,531
Do you think you deserve to be punished?

992
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,723
(CHATTING)

993
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,850
Should we wait for Lynne
or just start without her?

994
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,283
Everyone, I'm sorry for the intrusion,

995
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,930
but this is the police.

996
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,445
You don't say.

997
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,651
I'm Detective Glenn Bolton.
This is Homer,

998
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,246
and McDylan I guess
you've already all met.

999
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,323
We'd like to ask you all some questions.

1000
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,443
Jesus.

1001
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,443
You must be Mr. Kosca.

1002
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:46,763
It's pronounced "Koza."

1003
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:50,242
Why don't we start with you?

1004
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,683
Can we get a couple chairs?
Just set them aside

1005
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,969
so we can speak to Mr. Kosca.

1006
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,521
"Koza."

1007
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,650
And if this has anything
to do with Marla Finch,

1008
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,569
I hardly knew the woman, okay?

1009
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,330
So why don't you just leave
me out of this?

1010
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,768
- You know Ron Merrick?
- I most certainly do not.

1011
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,367
Oh, I think you do.
You threatened him the other night.

1012
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,325
- I did no such thing.
- Right here in group.

1013
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,761
Something about a pipe.

1014
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,607
Mmm, does that ring any bells,
Mr. Kosca?

1015
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,570
- "Koza!" It's "Koza."
- LYNNE: Oscar.

1016
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,850
Hey, remember me? I'm Detective McDylan.

1017
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,964
I'm not delusional, Detective.
I know who you are.

1018
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,726
- You don't have to handle me.
- Okay, what about Cassie?

1019
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,445
You remember Cassie from group here?

1020
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,446
Huh? Cassie's stepfather
Ron Merrick was murdered.

1021
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,841
Now that's three murders
with ties to this group.

1022
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,765
Marla, her ex-boyfriend,
and now Cassie's step...

1023
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,527
I didn't... come... guys, come on.

1024
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:57,129
I come to group because it's supposed
to be a safe place to share things.

1025
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,851
Hey, listen, all we're asking

1026
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,446
is that you consider us
just new members of the group.

1027
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:03,965
Just for tonight, okay?

1028
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,282
Maybe we can find out something
that might be helpful.

1029
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,966
We might not find anything,
but we'll never know if we don't ask.

1030
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,810
All right?

1031
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,486
Now that's three murders, guys.
We have to be here.

1032
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,405
We have to talk to everybody.
You understand that, right?

1033
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,483
I mean, you'd want that.

1034
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,688
You don't want us to make any mistakes.

1035
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,644
Right?

1036
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,002
You prick. How dare you?

1037
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,721
Now? Now you're supposed
to be all caring for us?

1038
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,961
You know what?

1039
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:34,170
I think we'll have a little more
privacy down at the station.

1040
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:39,326
You can share with all of us
downtown, Mr. Kosca.

1041
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,682
Get your hands off.
Get your hands off of me.

1042
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,605
Get your hands off me!

Hey, what's going on with Oscar?

01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,004
Oscar is spending the night with us.

1051
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,289
You don't really think
he killed Cassie's stepdad.

1052
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,602
He's not capable of something like that.

1053
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,047
Well, maybe you don't know
people as well as you think you do.

1054
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,402
He's got a history of making threats,
did you know that?

1055
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,928
The accused in his daughter's case,
the DA, the lead investigator.

1056
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,884
These are the kinds of threats
people remember, too.

1057
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,128
Did he actually do any of it?

1058
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,408
Has Oscar actually hurt anybody?

1059

I don't know. That's what
we're trying to figure out, okay?

I'm gonna get back to my shitty job.

Do you have a few minutes?

1072
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,646
I read about your daughter's case.

1073
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,802
They really botched it.

1074
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,242
It's bureaucracy.

1075
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,091
All these functionaries

1076
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,163
who only know how to push paper around.

1077
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,846
When the facts don't match up
with the paperwork,

1078
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,162
they discount the facts.

1079
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:15,530
They "lost" his DNA,
so he didn't rape my daughter.

1080
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,449
Yeah.

1081
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,849
I bet his high-priced lawyer
paid someone to lose it.

1082
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,808
They couldn't move forward without it?

1083
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,442
No, without physical evidence,
it's her word against his.

1084
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,331
And they made her out to...

1085
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,444
to look like a slut.

1086
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,450
And it devastated her.
It just ruined her.

1087
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:45,844
And all this time, knowing this guy
Watson is still out there.

1088
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,644
Why are you suddenly so interested?

1089
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,650
Because I know how your daughter felt.

1090
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,366
Hopeless.

1091
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,083
One of the guys who raped me was a cop.

1092
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,566
You never talk in group.
You never say anything.

1093
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,927
There were five of them.

1094
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,042
I thought the sheriff would protect me.

1095
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,891
I was wrong.

1096
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,930
Were they caught?

1097
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:26,124
They weren't arrested,
if that's what you mean.

1098
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:32,449
(SCOFFS) You know, you tell your kids
to trust the authorities, right?

1099
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,046
Call 911, call the cops.

1100
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,921
Emma didn't want to do it.
I had to convince her to do it.

1101
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,889
I told her, "You've got to do this.

1102
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:44,010
You've got to report this guy.
He's just gonna do it to somebody else."

1103
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,084
But the day that this guy walked,

1104
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,211
I'll never forget the expression
on her face,

1105
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,641
the disappointment that she had in me.

1106
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,327
Not in the cops,
not in the lawyers, but in me.

1107
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,450
Because I told her to do it.

1108
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,840
I let her down.

1109
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,287
I think justice has a way
of finding people.

1110
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,523
Yeah, well, I've given up on justice.

1111
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:15,603
How did her rapist get
a restraining order against you?

1112
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,565
I thought if he saw my face

1113
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,081
that he wouldn't forget her.

1114
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:25,289
That maybe he would confess.

1115
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,842
He owned this gym.
That's where it happened.

1116
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,889
So I went there every day

1117
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,566
and I talked to everybody
who went in and out of that place

1118
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:36,485
and I wanted them to know what he did.

1119
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:37,687
So what does he do?

1120
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:42,447
He turns around and he sues me for libel
and gets a restraining order against me.

1121
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:46,161
He sold that gym,
but he's still a fucking trainer.

1122
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,482
Some sleazy place on 17th Street.

1123
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,722
They made it sound
like you were dangerous.

1124
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,082
(LAUGHS) Come on, look at me.

1125
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,449
Compared to Watson, that creature.

1126
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,568
But I should have done something.

1127
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,366
I should have done something
to make things right.

1128
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,841
Even if it meant me going
to jail for the rest of my life,

1129
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,002
I should have done something.

1130
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,689
DOCTOR: But you're not talking about
punishment, you're talking about vengeance.

1131
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,763
Taking the law into your own hands.

1132
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,048
I'd rather that
than leave it in nobody's,

1133
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,201
which is where it is now.

1134
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,084
You believe that?

1135
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,009
Don't you?

1136
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,329
Set aside for a moment
the countless rapists

1137
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,968
who go unpunished, what about
people like Cassie's mom?

1138
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,242
Serving her daughter up to a monster.

1139
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,561
She gets a big pass.

1140
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,529
She's not even in the system.

1141
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,409
Who's gonna make her pay
for what she did?

1142
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,050
That's not your job.

1143
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,567
Don't you think she's been affected
by her decisions?

1144
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,285
No. That's bullshit.

1145
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,363
I saw her and she looked fine to me.

1146
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,730
Everybody has their own problems,
their own destiny.

1147
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,929
You need to worry about
your choices and actions.

1148
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,242

Is that after everything
you've been through,

1152
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,961
you have essentially learned nothing.

1153
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,963
No.

1154
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,169
I've learned a lot.

Get your hands on
your fucking head right now.

You all right? Yeah?

- Sure.

Great.

1187
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,683
Okay.

1188
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,808
Let's see.

1189
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,566
- The knife was yours, right?
- Yes.

1190
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,449
The Taser I'm not sure about

1191
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,887
because it had your fingerprints
on it as well as his.

1192
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,889
It's mine. I was raped.

1193
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:23,969
Of course I don't go out
without defensive weapons.

1194
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,531
Naturally.

1195
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,002
And now, why were you
in that part of town?

1196
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:31,970
I was looking at a gym on 17th.

1197
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,884
On 17th.

1198
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,202
So you were eight blocks north of there.

1199
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,170
I got lost going home.

1200
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,004
Thought someone was following me.

1201
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,969
Guess I panicked.

1202
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,003
Why not a gym in your own neighborhood?

1203
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:49,050
Can't afford it.

1204
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,851
All right, well, the gym explains
the change of clothes.

1205
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,490
You found my bag, good.

1206
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,483
But not the lighter fluid.

1207
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,166
I was returning it.

1208
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,766
- To whom?
- The store.

1209
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,048
- It was the wrong kind.
- For what?

1210
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,409
A lighter. Started smoking again.

1211
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,686
It was used.

1212
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,531
I opened it before I realized.

1213
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,920
What store?

1214
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,684
Pharmacy on 15th.

1215
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,008
- Where was the receipt?
- In the bag.

1216
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,367
And the man? Who was he to you?

1217
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,602
The man who attacked me.

1218
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,524
Hmm.

1219
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,045
So who's the little girl in the picture?

1220
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,690
It's just a girl.

1221
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,162
Just a girl whose picture
you wear around your neck?

1222
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,966
It reminds me of something.

1223
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,248
Oh? What?

1224
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,050
Innocence.

1225
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,402
You need to be reminded of that?

1226
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,240
I know who she is.

1227
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,762
Chastity Storch.

1228
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,407
Her father was a Louisiana sheriff.

1229
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,130
Killed in a murder-suicide

1230
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,489
with some inbred redneck buddies of his.

1231
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,729
You know, there was one missing piece.

1232
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,087
Someone the police wanted to talk to.

1233
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,449
Jennifer Hills.

1234
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,769
Why'd you change your name?

1235
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,764
I didn't want to be
Jennifer Hills anymore.

1236
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:24,003
All right,

1237
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,567
let's just cut the shit, okay?

1238
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:29,769
We've got you, you understand?

1239
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,361
Do you understand?

1240
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,801
See, this, all this,
it's just a process.

1241
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,803
You know, the system.

1242
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,281
But it's done.

1243
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,887
We're not idiots, Ms. Hills.

1244
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:50,123
And, you know, it's actually
a very easy storyline to follow.

1245
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:53,443
You become buddy-buddy
with Marla Finch from group

1246
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:56,410
and, you know, yes, that was a terrible,

1247
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:58,324
terrible thing that happened to her.

1248
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,163
- Then the boyfriend walks and you snap.
- (SNAPS FINGERS)

1249
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,164
I understand that. I honestly do.

1250
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,609
And there are some days, whew,
I want to do the exact same thing.

1251
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,287
And then that girl, what was her name?

1252
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,083
Cassie. Jesus.

1253
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,925
I can't imagine
what it was like sitting there

1254
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,687
listening to that little girl
talk about being raped

1255
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,687
by her stepfather and not wanting
to shove a pipe up that guy's ass.

1256
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,970
That's actually what your buddy
Oscar suggested doing, right?

1257
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,600
That exact same thing, huh?

1258
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,366
- You know what?
- Hmm?

1259
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,046
Now that I think about it...

1260
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,241
Lynne seemed especially
upset about it all.

1261
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,050
Have you looked into her whereabouts?

1262
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,283
Yeah, well, we didn't find Lynne

1263
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,762
in a fight to the death
with Cole Watson.

1264
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,964
Who's Cole Watson?

1265
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,885
Man, don't kid yourself, Jennifer.

1266
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,203
We're looking at full-blown
premeditated murder.

1267
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,010
That guy attacked me.

1268
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:10,288
And if you hadn't shot him dead,
he would have killed me.

1269
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,364
I'm guessing they're not gonna
charge you because you're cops.

That's funny.

1272
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,722
You should hold on
to your sense of humor.

1273
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,530
You're gonna need it.

1274
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,569
Do I get a lawyer?

1275
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:27,520
Or is that just for people who you
haven't already decided are guilty?

Detective McDylan...

1279
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,161
Detective McDylan!

1280
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:42,924
I did it.

1281
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:46,323
- WOMAN: Oh, my God!
- MAN: Everybody get back.

1282

1287
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,642
I murdered them.

Hey, Angela. I'll give you a ride.

- I'm sure you are.

1291
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,448
Just let me give you a ride.
I'm trying to help you out here.

1292
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,284
Like you care!

1293

You fuckers are no better
than the rapists.

1294
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:32,721
Let me ask you something.

1295
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,201
Did you spend this much time
investigating Marla's ex?

1296
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,725
Or were you saving that all for me?

1297
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,724
Honestly, if I had any idea
how incompetent the police were,

1298
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,690
I would have spent my life
hiding in fear.

I'm serious.
You skip bail, you're fucked.

1301
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,808
I'm fucked already.

1302
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,803
So are we gonna talk about it?

1303
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,764
What's there to talk about?

1304
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,885
Are you gonna tell me that you ran
into a door or fell down the stairs?

1305
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:02,690
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

1306
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,804

1307
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,530
Try me.

1308
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,686
The truth is you want justice,
you take it for yourself.

1309
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,968
No one can give it to you.

brought you any peace.

I'll bet you want to give me a ride.

let me just take you home.

I don't know... what is this?

You gonna be okay if I go?

to protect me?
