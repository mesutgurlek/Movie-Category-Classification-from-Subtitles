1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,680
We're called 
 the Midnight Society.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,800
[COYOTE HOWLING]

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,360
Separately, we're very different. 
 We like different things,

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,160
We go to different schools, 
 and we have different friends.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,160
But one thing draws us together--

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,880
The dark.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,800
Each week, 
 we gather around this fire

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,680
To share our fears 
 and our strange and scary tales.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,280
It's what got us together,

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,840
and it's what keeps 
 bringing us back.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,920
This is a warning to all who join us--

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,840
you're going to leave 
 the comfort of the light...

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,760
And step into the world 
 of the supernatural.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,160
Watch your step.

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,720
- Hey, watch it, man! 
 - I'm sorry.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,520
Frank Moore, 
 you're here to be considered

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
as a new member of 
 the Midnight Society.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,560
Yeah, what's with the blindford?

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,680
This meeting place is a secret.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,720
Yeah, and you're not in yet.

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,920
- [FRANK] Swell. 
 - Who sponsors, Frank?

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,840
I do. 
 He's a good guy.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,880
Yeah, but can he tell a good story?

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,400
Who said that?

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,280
To be a member, you have 
 to tell us a scary tale.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,400
Then we vote, and it has 
 to be unanimous or you're not in.

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,960
- You ready? 
 - Yeah. I'm ready.

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,400
- Are you guys ready? 
 - Ohh!  - Ohh!

29
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,600
I'm scared now. Ooh!

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,960
Yo, take this thing off.

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,640
Sorry. 
 Not unless you get in.

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,360
You're the sponsor, Dave. 
 You got to start it.

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,440
Remember how to do it?

34
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,480
[FRANK] 
 Just say the word.

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,640
Anytime. 
 OK, let's do it.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,680
Submitted for the approval, 
 of the Midnight Society,

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,840
I call this story...

38
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,640
[FRANK] 
 Denny and Buzz were brothers.

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,760
Denny was big, strong, and smart.

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Buzz was, well, kind of a geek

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,560
who wanted to prove himself 
 to his big brother.

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,800
What neither guy knew was 
 that on this hiking trap,

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Buzz was going to get the chance.

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,520
So where are we, Tonto?

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,160
This is strange.

46
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,680
We're lost, aren't we? 
 "Don't sweat, Denny.

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,840
I know how to plot a course. 
 You never trust me."

48
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,840
I did trust you, and you 
 got us lost, Cheeseball.

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,280
- We're not lost. 
 - Watch it!

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,920
Great, Lame-wad!

51
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,320
Now we're lost, 
 and we can't read the map.

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,720
You are such a loser.

53
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,240
I'm not a loser, 
 and we're not lost.

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,440
Look. 
 There's the ridge we came up on.

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,560
We can circle back 
 and take the red trail.

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
Man, this is whacked.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,160
Watch the edge.

58
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,400
Whoa!

59
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,520
- Grab my hand. 
 - I can't! I'll fall!

60
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,400
Grab me you jerk!

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,160
Hey, I saved the compass.

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,680
I should have let you fall.

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,600
[FRANK] 
 The guys really were lost.

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,280
It was just a pain at first,

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,440
but nighttime was coming up fast, 
 and It was getting cold.

66
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,760
It doesn't make sense.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,440
Do you even know 
 how to use this?

68
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,360
Give me a break. 
 We've been going South for hours.

69
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,920
We should have been in town by now.

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,840
Look, the needle points North, 
 and we're headed South.

71
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
What can I say?

72
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,240
That the way you always hold it?

73
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,840
Yeah. So?

74
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,080
Your belt buckle, genius. 
 It's metal.

75
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,720
The needle's always going to point to it, 
 because it's a magnet.

76
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
- Uh-oh. 
 - Yeah. Uh-Oh.

77
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,680
We've been going 
 the wrong way all day.

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,560
Now we're lost, 
 and its freezing.

79
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,720
- You are worthless! 
 - No! No! I know this place.

80
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,160
We've got to be close to town!

81
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,760
[DENNY] 
 Slow down!

82
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,480
This trail up here! 
 Come on!

83
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,080
I should pound you!

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,240
Look!

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,760
Someone's coming.

86
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,520
- [DENNY] Maybe it's a Ranger. 
 - Or maybe it's a hiker

87
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,480
that knows his way back to town.

88
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,400
I hope he's got a blanket. 
 I'm freezing!

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,720
- Me, too! 
 - Forget it! You can freeze.

90
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,520
Maybe it's a maniac killer 
 in a hockey mask

91
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,640
who's going to slash us.

92
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,760
Or maybe you should stay here, 
 and let me do the talking.

93
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,720
Uh, hey, hello, who's there?

94
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,080
Whoa! Turn off the brights.

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Hello. 
 What have we here?

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,040
I'm Buzz, and this is Denny.

97
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,680
We got lost, we can't 
 find the trail back to town.

98
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,760
Easy, Toad.

99
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,480
- You're not a Ranger, are you? 
 - Ha ha ha!

100
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,440
Ranger? No, not me.

101
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,280
I'm a traveler, same as you.

102
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,320
Flynn's the name. 
 Ha ha ha!

103
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,200
So, what are you doing up here? 
 Are you lost, too?

104
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,760
Lost-- me? 
 Oh, you might say that,

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,680
though I suppose 
 I couldn't be truly lost.

106
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
I know these woods too well.

107
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,040
We far from town? 
 Farther than you know, my friends.

108
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,760
- Farther than you know. 
 - So, can you help us get back?

109
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,960
Me?

110
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,160
Yeah, you. 
 I don't see anybody else here.

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,960
You guys look half-frozen. 
 Tell you what.

112
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,360
You follow me, and I'll lead you 
 to someone who can help you.

113
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,160
Wait.

114
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,680
I wouldn't go with him. 
 He gives me the creeps.

115
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
You got a better idea?

116
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,480
Don't worry. 
 I can handle this dude.

117
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,600
[BUZZ] Why don't you just 
 tell us how to get back?

118
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,760
Too far. You'd never find 
 your way in the dark.

119
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,720
So who's this guy 
 you're taking us to?

120
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,800
The Good Doctor. He's got a 
 cottage little ways up here.

121
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,040
In the woods?

122
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,440
What kind of a doctor 
 lives in the woods?

123
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,960
Patience, boys. You'll see. 
 By the way--

124
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,280
How are you guys at solving riddles?

125
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,920
Riddles? Why?

126
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,840
Just asking. Just asking.

127
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,320
There you go, boys-- 
 the home of the Good Doctor,

128
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,160
just like I promised.

129
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,680
You guys thought 
 I was joking, didn't you?

130
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,760
[DENNY] Who lives here, 
 the seven dwarves?

131
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,600
There's just one thing, guys.

132
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,280
Before you go asking 
 the doctor for help,

133
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,240
you make sure you really need it.

134
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,440
Why?

135
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,480
Well, sometimes the price 
 he charges is a little, uh... steep.

136
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,880
Ha ha ha ha!

137
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,080
So, why don't you tell us how--

138
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,240
- Yo, Flynn! 
 - This is creepy. Let's bolt.

139
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,880
To where? 
 We're lost, remember?

140
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,080
You're not going in there!

141
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,800
What else are we going to do? 
 It's freezing.

142
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,920
Maybe he's got a phone.

143
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,040
Back off, would you?

144
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,280
I'm sorry I got us lost, Denny.

145
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,040
Don't worry. I'll smack 
 you when we get home.

146
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,360
- [TWIG SNAPS] 
 - [SOBBING]

147
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,320
What's that?

148
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,680
Flynn, I know it's you. 
 He's trying to scare us.

149
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,320
- He's doing a good job. 
 - [TWIG SNAPS]

150
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,000
That can't be him, too. 
 Probably a raccoon.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,360
- That's no raccoon! 
 - [HIGH-PITCHED WAILING]

152
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,240
- Denny, what's going on? 
 - [WICKED LAUGHTER]

153
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,280
Denny-- come on!

154
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,640
- What's there? 
 - I don't know.

155
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,160
Open up!

156
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,080
[MAN] You boys have made 
 a very grave mistake.

157
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,640
I don't suppose either of you

158
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,440
Ha ha ha ha!

159
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,800
The wrong house. 
 Bye.

160
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,920
Boys, boys. 
 You've made a mistake.

161
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,920
If you're at my door at 
 this time of night,

162
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,000
you've taken a wrong turn 
 and lost your way. Correct?

163
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
- Yeah. 
 - Happens all the time.

164

Come in, come in. 
 Get warm.

165

Vink's the name-- Dr. Vink.

166
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,360
- Dr. Fink? 
 - Vink-- with a vvv, vvv, vvv, vvv.

168
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,880
Hot Tea at a cold night-- perfect.

169
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,840
[DENNY] uh... Flynn said you could 
 help us find a way to get back to town.

170
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,920
- Natural Science. 
 - Huh?

171
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,680
That's why I'm here, 
 in case you're wondering.

172
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,760
I dedicated my life 
 to studying Flora and Fauna.

173
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,120
Who?

174
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,360
There are many strange and 
 wonderful things that ocur in nature,

175
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,480
but no one takes the time 
 to really look and study.

176
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,600

177
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,240
[WHISPERING] 
 This guy's a nut-bag.

178
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,080
Behold a true wonder of nature--

179
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,840
the brian of a Wild Boar.

180
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,400
Eewww... cool!

181
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,440
I've discovered that long 
 after the body dies,

182
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,400
the brain still gives 
 off electric impluses.

183
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,600
Can you imagine If that 
 energy could be harnessed?

184
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,400
And, I am not a nut-bag.

185
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,120
Look, our parents are probably 
 going nuts by now, and, uh--

186
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,600
Riddles.

187
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,080
How are you boys at riddles?

188
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,440
Doc, we're tired, 
 and we just want to go home.

189
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,240
Indeed, indeed. 
 But first, a riddle.

190
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,440
Try this one--

191
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,080
how far can you walk 
 into the woods?

192
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,840
We don't want to do riddles.

193
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,360
But you must! 
 Riddles exercise your brain,

194
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,520
and where would you 
 be with no brain?

195
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,840
I don't know. 
 Ask the Wild Boar.

196
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,800
- Halfway. 
 - Say what?

197
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,560
He asked how far 
 you can walk into the woods.

198
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,520
Halfway. 
 After that, you'd be walking out.

199
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,080
Good! Very good!

200
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,000
You may do.

201
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,880
[DENNY] 
 Uh, I'm going to call our folks.

202
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,000
No, no, not yet!

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,840
We've only just begun. 
 No. I think we're done.

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,360
We play by my rules, 
 or we don't play.

205
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,480
- What do you want? 
 - Another riddle.

206
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,600
Here's the deal--

207
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,000
I ask you a riddle, 
 and if you solve it,

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,800
you could call your parents.

209
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,400
And If we don't solve it?

210
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,520
- Then you leave. 
 - That's it? We just leave?

211
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,440
Simple, no?

212
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,760
Let's do it. 
 I'm good at riddles.

213
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,600
- OK, what's the riddle? 
 - Wonderful.

214
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,160
Wonderful! 
 Now, what riddle?

215
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
Let's see. There's the...

216
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,200
No, not that one.

217
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,360
Maybe the...

218
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,110
No.

219
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,440
Ah-- the perfect choice.

220
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,600
This is a riddle that 
 has perplexed many

221
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,360
and confounded even more,

222
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,160
and now, young lads, 
 it's your turn to solve it.

223
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,960
Here we go.

224
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,040
What is it that had no weight,

225
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,920
can be seen by the naked eye,

226
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,480
and If you put in a barrel,

227
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,880
It would make the barrel lighter?

228
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,480
- I hate riddles! 
 - OK. It's weightless,

229
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,480
tt can be seen by the naked eye,

230
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,040
and if put in a barrel, 
 would make the barrel lighter.

231
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,790
So?

232
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,880
I don't know.

233
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,760
Good-bye. 
 I knew you wouldn't get it.

234
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,960
Wait. 
 That riddle was too hard.

235
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,920
- Give us another one. 
 - You had your chance and failed,

236
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,000

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,320
Others? What others?

238
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,120
Go away.

239
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,000
- You know where the door is. 
 - But we're lost!

240

Take a left on the trail, 
 and follow it to dirt road, and wait.

241
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,880
A taxicab will pick you up.

 Hurry, or you'll miss it.

There is one way, 
 I suppose.

246
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,880
What? What's that?

247
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,880
- You can leave me a specimen. 
 - A specimen?

248

You're much smarter than your 
 brother gives you credit for.

What kind of specimen?

250
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,840
Something 
 I can use in my experiments.

251
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,440
Something valuable.

252
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,080
Something fresh.

253
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,440
Something like...

254
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,540
- this! 
 - Aah! - Aah!

255

- Maybe it can. 
 - Yeah, right.

261
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
It's weightless, you can see it,

262
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,000
and if you put it in a barrel, 
 it makes the barrel lighter.

263
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,520
No way.

264
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,560
Sounds like one of those riddles 
 you can't solve.

265
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,080
- That's a cheat. 
 - No. Maybe it can be solved.

Maybe you should all just lighten up 
 and let me finish the story.

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,520
They all die, just like me.

313
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,120
Every night I have the same 
 accident with a different fare.

314
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,200
Its kinda of a curse. 
 You probably heard some of my fares

315
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,320
- up around Dr. Vink's house. 
 - The bushes-- they were ghosts!

316
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,480
Nobody can leave until someone 
 solves Dr. Vink's riddle.

317
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,800
I was hoping the two of you 
 could do it--

318
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,280
You know, somehow 
 break the spell. Oh, well.

319
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,720
Wait till you see the accident 
 we're going to have.

320
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,680
- It's going to be a real doozie. 
 - This is your fault!

321
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,160
You said you could solve the riddle! 
 You still got time.

322
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,920
We don't crash for another, 
 oh... 30 seconds.

323
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,360
Think fast, boys.

324
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,000
- Think! 
 - OK, OK. It's weightless,

325
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
it can be seen by the naked eye, 
 and if it's put in a barrel,

326
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,360
it will make the barrel lighter.

327
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,640
- [RATTLING DOOR HANDLE] 
 - We're dead. We're dead!

328
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,720
- I can't think like this! 
 - You have to!

329
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,280
It's helium! 
 Helium will make the barrel lighter.

330
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,240
- But you can't see helium. 
 - Won't be long now.

331
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,520
What can you see that's weightless?

332
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,360
Nothing. 
 Air, but you cant see air.

333
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,000
Or can you? Wait a second. 
 There's a trick here.

334
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,280
You can't put something 
 in the barrel to make it lighter.

335
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,240
You have to take something out.

336
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,800
If you take something out 
 of the barrel itself,

337
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,280
it'll be lighter.

338
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,360
Wait till you see the explosion 
 we're going to make.

339
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,400
- I got it! I know the answer! 
 - What is it?

340
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,480
It's weightless, you could see it,

341
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,840
and if you put it a barrel, 
 it'll make the barrel lighter.

342
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,080
- Say it! 
 - It's a hole in the barrel!

343
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,480
Here we go-- yee-ha!

344
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
We didn't crash. 
 We're alive.

345
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,880
Where's the cab? 
 It's gone.

346
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,600
We broke the curse. 
 We're saved!

347
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,520
No, we didn't break the curse. 
 You did.

348
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,600
Nice going. 
 But you're still a loser!

349
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,040
Oh, man, not again!

350
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,240
- You Denny and Buzz Crockers? 
 - Yeah.  - Yeah.

351
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,160
Your parents have been 
 going nuts looking for you.

352
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,640
The whole town's in an uproar. 
 Come on. Get in.

353
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,760
What are you boys doing here, 
 anyway?

354
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,760
- Tell me something. 
 - How are you at riddles?

355
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,600
[FRANK] No one ever saw 
 the Phantom Cab again,

356
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,560
and when the boys brought the police 
 back to Dr Vink's cottage,

357
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:58,560
all that was left was an old stone 
 foundation covered with weeds.

358
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,520
The End.

359
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,560
And now, we vote. 
 Thumps up means Frank's in,

360
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,520
thumbs down, he's not, 
 and it has to be unanimous.

361
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,280
David?

362
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,930
Kiki?

363
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,520
Betty Ann?

364
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,280
Kristen?

365
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,530
Eric?

366
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,120
And me.

367
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,120
Congratulations, Frank. 
 Welcome to the Midnight Society.

368
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,520
All right! Good job.

369
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,920
Yeah. 
 This is going to be good.

370
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,000
All right.

371
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,920
