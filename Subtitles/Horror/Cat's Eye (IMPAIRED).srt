308
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:08,437
Now, I want you to get dressed,
and you and I will have a talk.

309
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,872
- You gotta watch it.
- OK.

310
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,217
Junk, you think eight pounds
is bad in six months?

311
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:14,020
I think it's great.

312
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:18,208
So remember, now, some of
these diet pills are highly illegal

313
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:20,144
so I want you to
use them sparingly.

314
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:23,347
Now I'm setting your maximum
weight at 165 pounds.

315
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:27,619
If I go over it, you'll send a guy to my
house with a flamethrower or something?

316
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,657
No, I'll send a guy to your house and
cut off your wife's little finger.

317
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:32,491
You kill me.

318

- Yes, sir, Mr. Cressner.

He's got my wife and
her friend in view?

Yes, sir, she and the tennis guy are
in a white mustang convertible.

The golden nugget will be fine, OK?

- Look, what is all this about?

450
00:44:29,273 --> 00:44:32,176

is very simple.

Hi, daddy.

623
01:07:48,517 --> 01:07:52,458
You know, Amanda, it would be a lot easier
for me to get General back in the house

624
01:07:52,459 --> 01:07:55,193
if I knew what these bad
dreams were all about.

Why?

626
01:07:58,865 --> 01:08:02,434
Why? Because when <i>you</i> play
the violin, little girl,

627
01:08:02,435 --> 01:08:06,642
everybody listens, including
your mom. So, come on. Tell me.

628

that there's a monster in it.

about the goats?

632
01:08:19,257 --> 01:08:22,326
Well, this one lives in
my wall right there.

633
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:32,205
But General kept those
dreams away last night.

634

Can't he come in for
good, daddy, please?

635
01:08:35,742 --> 01:08:39,679
You know, Amanda, your mom
is really serious about this.

636
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:42,217
Yeah, I know. Just like
getting your back teeth.

637
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:47,023
That's where all the food gets stuck,

off to the best of starts.

640

around. No promises, but maybe.

- Depends? Depends on what?

775
01:29:52,607 --> 01:29:57,145
On whether or not I can keep General
and sleep with me at night.

776
01:29:57,146 --> 01:30:00,982
Amanda! That's blackmail.

777
01:31:45,910 --> 01:31:48,311
Hi.

778
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,920
("CAT'S EYE" PLAYING)

779
01:32:28,545 --> 01:32:32,183
<i>I didn't know I was
under your spell</i>

780
01:32:32,184 --> 01:32:36,020
<i>I couldn't know
There was no way to tell</i>

781
01:32:36,021 --> 01:32:37,389
<i>I took the step</i>

782
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:41,927
<i>I slipped up and I
didn't know why</i>

783
01:32:43,896 --> 01:32:47,467
<i>Deep in the dark,
it was too hard to see</i>

784
01:32:47,468 --> 01:32:51,539
<i>That in the night,
it had come over me</i>

785
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:52,773
<i>You stole my soul</i>

786
01:32:52,774 --> 01:32:57,211
<i>Imprisoned me with your cat's eye</i>

787
01:32:58,714 --> 01:33:02,685
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you caught me unaware</i>

788
01:33:02,686 --> 01:33:06,523
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you hold me in your stare</i>

789
01:33:06,524 --> 01:33:10,161
<i>- Cat's eye
- Going to hide, but tell me where?</i>

790
01:33:10,162 --> 01:33:14,133
<i>- Cat's eye
- You've got me spellbound!</i>

791
01:33:14,134 --> 01:33:17,970
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you stole my breath away</i>

792
01:33:17,971 --> 01:33:21,608
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you kept me night and day</i>

793
01:33:21,609 --> 01:33:25,446

- I can never get away</i>

794
01:33:25,447 --> 01:33:29,451
<i>- Cat's eye
- I am spellbound!</i>

795
01:33:29,452 --> 01:33:33,522
<i>It's like a dream,
only when do I wake?</i>

796
01:33:33,523 --> 01:33:37,292
<i>Can't even scream
Every breath that I take</i>

797
01:33:37,293 --> 01:33:39,829
<i>Belongs to you
What can I do?</i>

798
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:42,800
<i>Why should I try?</i>

799
01:33:44,837 --> 01:33:48,673
<i>I walk around like
a boy in a trance</i>

800
01:33:48,674 --> 01:33:52,512
<i>You pull the strings
I'm a puppet, I dance</i>

801
01:33:52,513 --> 01:33:54,913
<i> You're holding me eternally</i>

802
01:33:54,914 --> 01:33:58,184
<i>In your cat's eye</i>

803
01:33:59,788 --> 01:34:03,659
<i>- Cat's eye
- Took my heart with just a look</i>

804
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:07,529
<i>- Cat's eye
- Every stare is like a hook</i>

805
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:11,033
<i>- Cat's eye
- Just one look is all it took</i>

806
01:34:11,034 --> 01:34:15,106
<i>- Cat's eye
- You made me spellbound!</i>

807
01:34:15,107 --> 01:34:18,843
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you stole my breath away</i>

808
01:34:18,844 --> 01:34:22,581
<i>- Cat's eye
- How you kept me night and day</i>

809
01:34:22,582 --> 01:34:26,353
<i>- Cat's eye
- I can never get away</i>

810
