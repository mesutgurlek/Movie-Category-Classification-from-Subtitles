1
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,960
They called him Machete.

2
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,920
$70 a day for yard work.

3
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,660
100 for roofing.

4
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,770
Get in.

5
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,360
125 for septic.

6
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,020
Sewage.

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,010
Have you ever killed anyone before?

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,130
As you may know,
illegal aliens such as yourself

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,960
are being forced out of our country
at an alarming rate.

10
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,530
for the good of both our people.

11
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,350
Our new senator must die.

12
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,260
And for that I will pay you $150,000...

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,850
cash.

14
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,090
He was given an offer
he couldn't refuse.

15
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,790
I cost the most...

16
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,400
'cause I'm the best there is.

17
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,450
Aah!

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,130
Set up, double-crossed,

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,530
and left for dead.

20
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,040
I took a vow of peace.

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,400
And now you want me
to help you kill all these men?

22
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, bro.

23
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,700
I mean, Padre.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,900
I will see what I can do.

25
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,370
He knows the score.

26
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,940
Where are my wife and daughter?!

27
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,780
He gets the women.

28
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,180
He's back

29
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,150
Machete

30
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,860
And he kills the bad guys.

31
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,230
No!

32
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,690
Oh, shit.

33
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,480
You mean that a Mexican day laborer

34
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,140
is a goddamn Federale?!

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,790
But they soon realized...

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,430
He's coming after us.

37
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,970
... they just fucked with the wrong Mexican.

38
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,070
- Uhh!
- Action.

39
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,230
Suspense.

40
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,280
Aaaah!

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,070
Emotion.

42
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,860
Please, Father, have mercy.

43
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,340
God has mercy. I don't.

44
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,210
If you are gonna
hire Machete to kill the bad guy,

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,850
you better make damn sure
the bad guy isn't you.

46
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,360
Machete

47

God damn it, girls.

If you are gonna do that shit,
do it onstage!

00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,330
Smoking hot. Whew!

55
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,220
Cherry, darling,
I told you too many fucking times--

56
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,230
you can't be up there crying
and all that shit.

57
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,020
You know what a go-go dance is?

58
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,700
Useless talent number 12?

59
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,760
No, it's a happy dance.

60
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,910
You get up there
and you dance happy.

61
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,350
It's go-go, not cry-cry.

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm quitting.

63

You say that
at least one night a week.

64
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,490
I mean it this time.

65
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,620
I need a dramatic change in my life.

66
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,400
I have always said you are funny.

67
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,060
But if you don't stop
all that crying and shit,

68
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,410
I'm gonna have to fire
your fucking ass,

69
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,630

Wait here, Lieutenant.

I will handle this.

Hey, Abby.

I can see you have had
a spot of trouble, Romey.

91
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,620
Would you like to tell me
what happened?

92

Well, they--they escaped.

I don't know how they did it.
Just, they got out--

98
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,730
I'm sorry, Romey,
but I just don't trust you anymore.

00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,660
And you know the rules.

But you only have to stay till 10:00.

172
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,100
(Whispering) A friend of mine will be here
before 10:00 to pick up Tony.

173
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,610
TONY: I'm going to eat your brains
and gain your knowledge.

174
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,950
What did I tell you?
No playing with toys at the table.

175
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,820
- Didn't I tell you that?
- Yeah.

176
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,550
There's a packed suitcase
under his bed.

177
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,240
Give it to Tony to take with him
when my friend picks him up.

178
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,390
I will leave him watching TV.

179
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,230
But you need to be here
in the next 20 minutes.

180
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,080
Thank you.

181
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,900
Hey, what happened to your tooth?

182
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,230
Fell out.

183
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,840
Wow.

184
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,640
Think you can say a prayer
for your old man?

185
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,500
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.

186
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,040
No dead bodies for Da-da tonight.
Amen.

187
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,650
Amen.

188
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,770
Who was that you were talking to?

189
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,220
Babysitter.

190
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,670
She's on her way.

191
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,450
- You believe her?
- No.

192
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,610
Me, neither.

193
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,060
- Hey.
- Hey.

194
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,790
- How's it going, J. T. ?
- All right.

195
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,180
- Still open, I see.
- Oh, yeah, all night.

196
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,270
[dog whines]

197
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,190
Free of charge.

198
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,660
Tonight...

199
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,540
is a special night.

200
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,600
What's so special about tonight?

201
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,690
Been open 25 years.

202
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,120
You are the second person
to show up tonight.

203
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,330
Who's the first?

204
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,970
Right there.

205
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,830
Must be passing through.

206
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,770
Seems only strangers eat here.

207
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,190
I still eat here, J. T.

208
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,330
Oh, yeah, you sure do.

209
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,240
By the way, don't choke
on all that food you are eating.

210
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,850
Hello, Palomita.

211
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,250
I don't go by that name anymore.

212
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,130
So, uh...

213
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,660
you ever become that--
that fancy doctor?

214
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,060
Never did.

215
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,760
I thought for sure you would.

216
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,410
Talked about it enough.

217
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,180
That's the problem with goals--

218
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,240
they become the thing you talk about
instead of the thing you do.

219
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,410
That's my jacket.

220
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,890
I looked for it for two weeks.

221
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,560
Yeah? How long did you
look for me, Wray?

222
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,400
Yeah, well, the jacket belonged to me.
You didn't.

223
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,070
So, um...

224
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,480
what are you doing now?

225
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,780
I'm going to be a stand-up comedian.

226
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,630
Really?

227
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,430
You are not funny.

228
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,330
That's what I have been trying
to tell everybody,

229
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,320
but they all say I'm hysterical.

230
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,310
But you are not.

231
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,680
There's a difference
between being frank

232
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,770
and being dick.

233
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,750
Yeah, well...

234
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,420
it was really good seeing you again.

235
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,750
Oh. Um...

236
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,340
what name do you go by now...

237
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,110
in case I want to catch
one of your shows?

238
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,000
Cherry.

239
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,680
Cherry Darling.

240
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,260
Sounds like a stripper.

241
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,900
No, it sounds like a go-go dancer.

242
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,110
There's a difference.

243
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,490
Right.

244
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,000
Well...

245
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,330
you will always be Palomita to me.

246
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,720
I need a ride.

247
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,290
[dog whines]

248
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,800
What do you say, El Wray?

249
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,940
I will give you a ride.

250
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,500
Good-bye, Bill.

251
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,440
- Don't you mean "see you later"?
- Of course.

252
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,830
Hey. What's up, Doc?

253
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,230
The little lady's looking
pretty good there, I gotta say.

254
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,740
Looks like she could suck
the bend out of a river.

255
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,060
I'm kidding. Heh.

256
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,010
- Take a look at that shit.
- BILL: What happened to your arm?

257
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,140
Well, uh... I got bit.

258
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,520
Bit? Bit by what?

259
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,800
Well, if I told you,
you probably wouldn't believe me.

260
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,900
I need some Bactine or something?

261
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,110
Whew.

262
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,790
Can't you just... sew it up?

263
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,130
Well, normally I would.

264
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,400
I would even be doing something
to stop the bleeding.

265
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,580
The only problem is
this one doesn't bleed.

266
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,350
DR FELIX:
Oh, shit. Check this out.

267
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,510
When this was still a military hospital,

268
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,550
this one guy came back
from Iraq with this.

269
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,720
Whew!

270
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,510
Chronic herpetic lesions.

271
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,820
When he urinated, it came out
through all these little holes here,

272
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,700
kind of like a fountain.

273
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,180
Oh, Jesus.

274
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,860
Well, how would you treat it?

275
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,860
Fuck that. I was never in Iraq.

276
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,250
Good for you. The shit they spread
around there you wouldn't believe.

277
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,420
I swear to God.
I have got these Iraqi eyeballs

278
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,460
a friend of mine brought back
to do some studies on.

279
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,660
Incredible. They were
completely milked over.

280
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,260
Mustard gas--
it does that to your eyes.

281
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,700
Actually, I still have those in my fridge.

282
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,390
Bot fly, do you think?

283
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,900
DR FELIX:
Chronic viral ulcerative lesion.

284
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,780
That looks like gout.

285
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,880
He's running a temperature of 105.

286

- Is that bad?
- It's high.

287
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,500
Bad will be 108.

288
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,170
You could have a seizure,
go psychotic.

289
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,980
And--and probably die.

290
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,720
Say "ahh. "

291
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,460
- Ahh.
- Oh! Jesus!

292
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,360
Oh, nice.

293
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,230
Black abscessed tongue.

294
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,360
All abscesses
should be drained, period.

(muffled) What are you doing?

297
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,390
Shut up, Joe.

298
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,330
Baby... get the needles.

299
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,520
Be right there.

300
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,790
BILL: [over speaker]
Right now.

301
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,970
Asshole.

302
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,360
It's spreading.

303
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,630
Holy shit.

304
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,190
- When did you say you got this bite?
- Just now.

305
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,180
We gotta lose the arm, Joe.

306
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,250
Lose the arm?
What do you mean, lose the arm? My arm?

307
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,020
It's spreading all the way
up to your shoulder.

308
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,810
Now, if we don't sever that arm now,
it's gonna take over your chest,

309
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,810
and we can't very well
cut that off, can we?

310
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,390
Well, shouldn't I get a second opinion?

311
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:22,950
Hi, Joe.

312
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,340
I'm going to give you
a very strong anesthetic,

313
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,980
so you won't feel anything
during the procedure.

314
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,250
These...

315
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,350

... are my friends.

316
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,510
My yellow friend...

317
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,890
- ... is just to take the sting off.
- Aah!

318
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,370
My blue friend...

319
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,150
you will barely feel.

320
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,700
That means my yellow friend
is already taking effect.

321
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,380
See how fast my friends work?

322

And after my red-headed friend...

... you will never see me again.

People picking up road kill.

361
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,220
What, like an armadillo?

362
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:24,970
Deer.

363
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,070
You get a lot of them around here.

364
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,250
You know, I read a statistic that said...

365
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,820
that the eating of venison has risen
30% in the last few years.

366
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,130
60% of that's from road kill.

367
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,140
People eat road kill?

368
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,180
If you are driving out here
at 70 miles an hour

369
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,970
and a deer darts out

if you blink or brake or swerve--

00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,080
shit, you will just kill yourself.

372
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,960
So, what do you do?

373
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,000
Just pick them off...

374
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,300
just like this.

375
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,030
Send it flying away from you.

I thought you said if you saw a deer,
you shouldn't fucking swerve!

381

It wasn't a deer.

- Don't let her die on me, Block.
- What do we got?

389
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Car accident. Heavy contusions
about the torso,

possible spinal trauma...

one severed limb.

Where's the leg?

393
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,880
Three sickos attacked her.

394
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,750
I shot at them.

395
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,410
I never miss.

396
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,660
They took the leg with them.

397
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,890
You will have to come with us, Wray.
We need to talk about this, you know?

398
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,760
He has to sign her in.

399
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,200
Do what, now?.

400
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,540
Well, he's with her.
He's responsible for her.

401
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,580
He can fill this out after we talk.
Let's go.

402
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,510
What are you doing
with a rifle, Wray?

403
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,440
Nothing.

404
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,610
Just thinking about maybe doing
some hunting when the season breaks.

405
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,980
Come on, Wray.

406
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,880
You know you are not supposed
to be doing that stuff anymore.

407
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,500
And here I stick my neck out for you.

408
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,500
Now you have got a gal in your wrecked truck
with a missing leg?

409
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,470
A missing leg that's now missing?

410
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,640
And here you are saying
in front of everybody

411
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,550
that someone up and snatched it?

412
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,200
And that you shot at them with a gun

413
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,590
that you never should have had
in the first place?

414
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,470
And that now they are gone?

415
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,570
Sheriff, can we finish
this conversation somewhere else?

416
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,510

That's unsanitary, Doc.

my state of calmness.

Yeah, don't get all worked up
enough to crack it.

Fuck.

00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,580
You might cut yourself pretty good.

428
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,850
Then I would know I was not calm.

429
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,340
Yeah, what do you say now, Doc?

430
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,800
Somebody call my wife.

Ever since that bastard landlord
raised the rent, it's gone to shit.

436
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,490
Well, I'm real sorry
to hear about that.

00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,090

I could do.

I'm listening. What's the trouble?

441
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,260
Well, what about

around here for over an hour.

They won't purchase
and they won't leave.

445
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,160
Oh, never mind. Here they come.

446
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,520
You cook that meat
at 250 degrees, don't you?

447
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,060
I don't remember.
I set the heat with my hand.

448
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,150
You give me that recipe, or I will raise
your rent higher than a Georgia pine.

449
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,060
<i>Brother, ain't no Texans ever gonna
give you his barbecue recipe.</i>

That's a fact.
He will take it to his grave.

00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,310
You gonna look.

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,920
or you gonna eat?

No.

471
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,390
I didn't.

472
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,040
What happened to her?

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,110
I don't know, baby.

474
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,520
I thought you stopped
seeing each other.

475
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,200
We have.

476
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,580
Well, yes, you have now--
she's fucking dead.

477
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,150
I mean, we--
we stopped before.

I--

479
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,960
I haven't talked to her in a while.

480
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,110
But you have written each other.

00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,190
Here and there.

482
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,030
But not--

483
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,630
What are you doing?!

484
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,010
Let me see your last three messages.

I don't have a right?

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,260
Show it to me.

Now, that's just to take the sting off.

492
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,350
Show it to me.

No, please.

00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,310
That's pretty fast.

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,570
[beep]

500
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,220
Oh, what do I know, my love?

501
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,450
Exactly.

502
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,360
That you are a cheating, lying...

503
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,270
sack.

504
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,580
I didn't want to hurt you.

505
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,010
BILL: [whispers]
But you did.

506
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,090
Bill...

507
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,680
you are insane.

508
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,460
And I was afraid...

509
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,840
of what you might do to me,

510
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,740
to our son.

511
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,080
I'm the mother of your son.

512
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,110
Aah!

513
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,430
And after this one...

514
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,030
I will never see you again.

515
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,040
PARAMEDIC: Doc.

516
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,820
What?

517
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,320
You gotta see this.

518
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,680
I will be right there.

519
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,570
Where the hell are the bodies?

520
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,580
That's what we wanted to show you.

521
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,450
They are gone.

522
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,810
They didn't just get up
and walk out, did they?

523
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,990
# Mmm-hmm #

[grunting]

526
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,130
Okay.

527
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,430
Okay.

528
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,310
Shut the fuck up!

529
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,490
Somebody take care of this perp for me
before I fucking kill him!

530
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,660
What the hell's going on?

531
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,290
Ah, he was causing a ruckus
over at Skip's place, so I cuffed him,

532
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,070
and the son of a bitch
bit my goddamn finger off!

533
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,050
Quit your hollering and get yourself
a goddamn Band-Aid.

534
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,330
I'm not exaggerating,
using colorful speech, Sheriff.

535
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,010
He bit my finger clean off!

536
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,880
Fucking shit!

537
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,630
Get out there and book him,

538
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,600
'cause I will fucking kill him
if I have to do it.

539
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,220
Carlos, go get him.

540
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,170
Wray, you stay put.

541
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,550
Are you sure he's in there?

542
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,120
He was.

543
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,230
Motherfucker.

544
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,620
[dramatic music]

545
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,910
He's gone.

546
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,310
Broke out the window.

547
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,640
Where's my finger?

548
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,230
Found your ring.

549
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,980
Could it be the same guy
as your leg-snatcher?

550
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,150
WRAY: I didn't get
a good look at mine.

[snarling]

552
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,690
That him over there?

[snarls]

566
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,880
- No, don't touch him!
- Why not?

567
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,750
He's infected.

568
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,250
With what?

569
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,520
Everything.

570
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,170
Wray!
Drop the fucking gun.

571
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,400
Where the fuck
do you think you are going?!

572
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,470
I'm gonna go get Cherry!

573
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,850
Fine. But we are taking my car.

574
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm riding with you.

575
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,200
Don't make any sudden moves.

576
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,460
Viral infections.

577
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,680
They came pouring in.

578
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,690
Some are rapidly developing
coliform lesions.

579
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,780
Highly contagious.

580
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,620
What do you think?

581
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,940
Self-preservation comes to mind.

582
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,800
Yeah. Let's get the hell out of here.

583
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,440
First let me get my wife.

I want you to be around for a while,
you understand?

594
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,530
We don't want you checking out
right this--

just do me a favor right now and just...

stay strong.

You can't bring them all.
Didn't I tell you that?

It's okay. They can live

Go ahead, drop your pants.

That will be good for a laugh.

Yes, I know.

I was cold.
I took your fucking jacket.

So, if you are gonna go on one of your
psycho obsessive controlling rants

00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,680
about a fucking jacket,
then fucking take it,

00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,990
'cause I would rather fucking freeze
than fucking hear about it one more time.

00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,730
Fuck no.

836
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,210

I have gotta take
the world's biggest fucking piss.

01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:27,790
JUNGLE JULIA: We can't be late!

1509
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:29,450
We won't!

1510
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:54,400
Who's... who's holding?

1511
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,110
If you are not, then nobody.

1512
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,910
We were kind of hoping you were.

1513
01:40:57,980 --> 01:41:00,480
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ, Shanna.

1514
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,650
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all
with weed when we go out.

1515
01:41:03,730 --> 01:41:05,930
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, little lady.

1516
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,990
You are getting angry kind of quick,
don't you think?

1517
01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:08,870
I was just teasing you!

1518
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:10,480
I'm not angry.
It just would be nice

1519
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:13,580
if y'all didn't just count on me
all the fucking time

1520
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:16,480
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.

1521
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:18,520
Okay, mean girl
in a high school movie.

1522
01:41:18,590 --> 01:41:20,030
Are you through
having a tantrum?

1523
01:41:20,030 --> 01:41:20,830
I'm not having a tantrum.

1524
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:23,410
Come on, don't fight.
I will pay for it when we get some.

1525
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:27,490
One, it is not about the money.
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.

1526
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:29,750
And two, we are not really fighting.

1527
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:33,500
Arlene, you have forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.

1528
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:34,370
That wasn't a fight.

1529
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:37,430
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch

1530
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:41,380
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.

Okay, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?

1534
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:50,790
You bet your ass he is...

1535
01:41:51,070 --> 01:41:53,220
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.

1536
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:55,830
He's got a big thing for Julia.

1537
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:58,130
If he had a big thing for me,
he would fucking call me,

1538
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,860
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,

1539
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:01,600
and he would get his ass down here
more often than he does.

1540
01:42:01,670 --> 01:42:04,410
And on my birthday
he would give me a fucking phone call.

1541
01:42:04,530 --> 01:42:06,720
But other than that he's putty
in my hands.

1542
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,820
So what's the plan, man?

1543
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:10,890
Margaritas and Mexican
food at Guero's,

1544
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:13,140
touch base with Chris and Jesse,
tell them about later,

1545
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:15,300
and make damn sure they come.

1546
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:18,550
Those other guys will be waiting for us
at the Texas Chili Parlor.

1547
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:21,890
Oh, shit. Speaking of which...

1548
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:23,960
what happened
with you and Nate last night?

1549
01:42:24,030 --> 01:42:26,730
Well, you know, not much.
We just fucking met each other.

1550
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,640
If you don't bust their balls a little bit,
they are never gonna respect you.

1551
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:32,080
Okay, we are pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.

1552
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:34,340
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?

1553
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:36,450
Oh, nothing to write home about.

1554
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,920
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.

1555
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:40,560
Dressed, half-dressed, or naked?

1556
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:43,300
Dressed. I said we made out.
We didn't do "the thing. "

1557
01:42:43,370 --> 01:42:46,770
Oh, excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?

1558
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:48,680
You know, it's everything but.

1559
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:50,480
They call that "the thing"?

1560
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:52,110
I call it "the thing. "

1561
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:54,150
Do guys like "the thing"?

1562
01:42:54,220 --> 01:42:55,920
They like it better than "no thing. "

1563
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,200
Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.

1564
01:43:00,270 --> 01:43:01,830
So you are making out
on the couch with Nate, right?

1565
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:02,940
Correct.

1566
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,470
Whose couch?
His or the one in your hotel room?

1567
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:06,980
What am I, stupid over here? Mine.

1568
01:43:07,050 --> 01:43:09,080
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?

1569
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:11,590
We started sitting up,
we worked our way to lying down.

1570
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:14,260
Hmm. The plot thickens.
Who was on top?

1571
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:16,660
I was straddling him.

1572
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,640
- So what about tonight?
- Well, we will see, Shanna.

1573
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:22,620
I mean I like Nate.
He's cute, he's a pretty good kisser.

1574
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:23,530
But it ain't a done deal.

1575
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:24,750
Yeah, fuck Nate.

1576
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:25,520
I mean, he's cute and all,

1577
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,620
but Jesse Letterman
is gonna be all over her.

1578
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:29,940
Jessie Letterman the Austin director
who did "Potheads"?

1579
01:43:29,940 --> 01:43:31,240
He's a good friend.

1580
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:32,950
Maybe they can bring some pot.

1581
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:34,710
Fuck that. No.

1582
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:37,170
I don't wanna be either A,
depending on their fucking ass,

1583
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:38,960
or B, depending on their ass.

- When were y'all gonna tell her?

- Soon.
- Tell me what?

Yeah, now thanks to you,
we have gotta tell her sooner than later.

All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

I said a little something-something
about you on the air today.

1617
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:14,530
Julia, what the fuck
did you say about me on the radio?

1618
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,240
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly

1619
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:20,340
who was in from out-of-town
for the weekend,

1620
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:23,040
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,

1621
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:25,520
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they would see us.

1622
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:29,590
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,

1623
01:45:30,270 --> 01:45:33,240
if they would do something,
you would do something.

1624
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:34,670
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.

1625
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:37,080
What did you say
and what did you say I would do?

1626
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:41,090
Anyhow, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,

1627
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:43,270
or Marcy over here,

1628
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:46,450
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,

1629
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:50,530
which I think will give you a better idea
what you have in store for you tonight.

1630
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:52,770
Okay, so just tell me your way.

1631
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:54,840
- So we will act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.

1632

Excuse me, but...

1644
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:30,110
your name wouldn't be
"Butterfly, " would it?

1645
01:46:30,190 --> 01:46:34,090
Yes, it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.

So is, uh...
"Butterfly" your real name?

1651
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,250
Yes, it is.

1652
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,260
And how would you know
my name, Barry?

1653
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:54,130
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this morning.

Oh, you did, did you?

Yeah, she's like

Nah, man!
I like her ass that way.

1660

She got a black girl's ass.

1661

[chuckles]
Well, that's what she always says,

1662
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:15,640
but in actual fact, she doesn't
really have a black girl's ass.

1663
01:47:15,710 --> 01:47:17,700
She's got a 'big' ass.

1664
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:18,920
Okay, what the fuck
are you doing?

black men and a whole lot
of motherfucking white men

have had plenty of fun
adoring my ass.

I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

If you are not gonna buy me a drink,
can I have mine back?

So, Butterfly...

1674
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:41,120
can I buy you a drink?

1675
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:42,110
I would love one.

1676
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:43,240
What can I get ya?

1677
01:47:43,330 --> 01:47:44,860
I will take a margarita.

Here ya go.

1680
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:50,910
So, after they buy you a drink

1681
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:53,380
when they raise
their glass to toast,

1682
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:57,460
they look you dead in the eye
and repeat this poem--

1683
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:02,130
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep

1684
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:06,970
And I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep. "

1685
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:10,080
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

1686
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:12,910
"Miles to go before you sleep. "

1687
01:48:13,190 --> 01:48:16,310
And then, if they say that...

1688
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:19,170
you gotta give them a lap dance.

1689
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:20,590
- BUTTERFLY: What?
- [laughs]

1690
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:23,770
If they call you "Butterfly, "
buy you a drink, repeat that poem,

1691
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:24,850
you gotta give them a lap dance.

1692
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:26,820
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothing.

1693
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,510
Well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,

1694
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:30,560
everybody in Austin
is gonna think you a chicken shit.

1695
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,490
And I don't think you want
everybody in Austin

1696
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,090
thinking you are a chicken shit.

1697
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:36,330
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.

1698
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:39,940
Look. You don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.

1699
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:41,990
I said you would do it
for the first guy who says it.

So, some geek comes over
trying to be cool,

1701

just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

1702
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:51,870
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.

1703
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:54,430
But maybe a little later
in the evening,

1704
01:48:54,580 --> 01:48:56,100
you have had a few drinks,

1705

you are kind of loosey-goosey,

1706

you are safe with your girls,

Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house"

01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:27,180
turns into a couple of guys

JUNGLE JULIA:
And where did you two disappear to?

1834
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:22,340
I had to get something
out of the car,

1835
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:25,530
and Nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella.

Ah, good for you, Nate.

You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?

Who, the dirty hippie?

Meow. She's not a hippie.

- You have been eavesdropping?
- [chuckles]

1855
01:58:07,630 --> 01:58:10,300
There's eavesdropping
and "can't help but hear. "

1856
01:58:10,370 --> 01:58:12,400
I think I belong
in the latter category.

So, uh, Icy Hot.

1858
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:17,680
You are offering me a ride home?

1859
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:21,380
I'm offering you a lift if when
I'm ready to leave, you are, too.

1860
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:23,690
And when are you
thinking about leaving?

1861
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,630
Truthfully,
I'm not thinking about it.

1862
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:29,510
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.

1863
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:31,940
Will you be able
to, uh, drive later?

1864
01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:34,040
I know looks can be deceiving.

1865
01:58:35,490 --> 01:58:36,460
But I'm a teetotaler.

1866
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:39,190
I have been drinking
club soda and lime all night,

1867
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:41,250
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.

- Which is what?
- Virgin pia colada.

1869
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:49,380
Okay. Why would
someone who doesn't drink

1870
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:52,110
spend hours at a bar drinking water?

1871
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:56,050
You know, a bar offers
all kind of things other than alcohol.

1872
01:58:56,130 --> 01:58:58,620
Mmm. Really?

1873

Stuntman Mike.

Stuntman Mike's your name?

1882

my own record label off the ground,

02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:43,590
What the fuck was that?

1967
02:03:45,420 --> 02:03:47,200
[chattering, laughing]

1968
02:03:48,730 --> 02:03:50,600
You got some voucher here.

1969
02:03:50,670 --> 02:03:52,330
I asked him
what movies you worked on.

1970
02:03:52,410 --> 02:03:54,100
No fucking clue.

1971
02:03:54,180 --> 02:03:57,410
Well, technically I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

1972
02:03:57,480 --> 02:04:00,460
I mean, he shows me
an episode of 'High Chaparral'.

1973
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:01,320
a guy falls off a horse,

1974
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:02,790
he says it's him.

1975
02:04:03,150 --> 02:04:03,990
[Warren laughs]

1976
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:06,900
You know the show 'The Virginian'?

1977
02:04:08,810 --> 02:04:11,500
Yeah, well, there was another
actor on that show, Gary Clarke,

1978
02:04:11,580 --> 02:04:13,450
and I looked like him a bit--

1979
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:16,680
well, obviously
before I cut myself shaving.

1980
02:04:16,750 --> 02:04:18,720
Tsk. Aww, I like it.

1981
02:04:18,790 --> 02:04:22,800
Well, damn, if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.

1982
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:26,540
Anyway, I did a lot of 'Virginians'
doubling Gary Clarke.

1983
02:04:26,610 --> 02:04:30,340
And, uh... then that show turned
into 'The Men of Shiloh'.

1984
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:33,150
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.

1985
02:04:33,220 --> 02:04:36,490
From that point on
I specialized mostly in car stunts.

1986
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:40,130
Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of 'Vega$'.

1987
02:04:40,200 --> 02:04:42,430
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

1988
02:04:42,510 --> 02:04:45,380
And then Bob
did another show, 'Gavilan'.

1989
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:47,940
and he brought me
with him on that, till--

1990
02:04:49,720 --> 02:04:50,520
And after that...

1991
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:58,340
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talking about?

1992
02:04:58,410 --> 02:04:59,210
Sorry.

1993
02:04:59,840 --> 02:05:00,850
- No?
- Mm-mm.

1994
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:01,910
No, no.

1995
02:05:05,150 --> 02:05:09,910
So how exactly does one
become a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?

1996
02:05:11,510 --> 02:05:12,510
[sighs]

1997
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:16,640
Well, in Hollywood, anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs

1998
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:19,610
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.

1999
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:23,310
But really I got into the business the way
most people get into the stunt business.

2000
02:05:23,390 --> 02:05:24,190
How's that?

2001
02:05:24,720 --> 02:05:26,740
- My brother got me in it.
- Well, who's your brother?

2002
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:28,100
Stuntman Bob.

2003
02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:29,590
[snorts, chuckles]

2004
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:31,880
[men chatting softly]

2005
02:05:37,420 --> 02:05:38,420
[phone beeping]

2006
02:05:42,030 --> 02:05:42,830
I'm ready to blaze!

2007
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:46,170
Finally, yeah.
You need to catch up with us.

2008
02:05:46,230 --> 02:05:48,240
- Now the party can start.
- Yep.

2009
02:05:48,570 --> 02:05:51,580
Anyhow, I'm sorry.
You forgive me?

2010
02:05:53,380 --> 02:05:57,390
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.

2011
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:59,890
Promise.
You ready to go to the lake?

2012
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:00,790
Mm-hmm.

2013
02:06:01,030 --> 02:06:03,800
- How about your friend, bring him?
- I thought no boys.

2014
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:06,100
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.

2015
02:06:06,170 --> 02:06:08,590
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?

2016
02:06:08,850 --> 02:06:10,540
Mmm, us girls.

2017
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:11,420
Good idea.

2018
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
[bottles clink]

2019
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:14,620
STUNTMAN MIKE: Ladies?

2020
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:19,790
Thanks.

2021
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:21,200
Cheers, Butterfly.

2022
02:06:23,610 --> 02:06:27,050
"The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep...

2023
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:29,750
"And I have promises to keep,

2024
02:06:29,820 --> 02:06:32,470
And miles to go
before I sleep. "

2025
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:35,270
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

2026
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:39,900
"Miles to go
before you sleep. "

2027
02:06:41,980 --> 02:06:43,550
Sorry, Stuntman Burt--

2028
02:06:43,550 --> 02:06:44,350
Mike.

2029
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:45,950
Mike.

2030
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:48,250
She already broke off that dance.

2031
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:49,650
Is that true?

2032
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:53,500
Did I miss my chance?

2033
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:58,870
Do I frighten you?

2034
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:05,190
Is it my scar?

2035
02:07:07,360 --> 02:07:09,090
It's your car.

2036
02:07:09,170 --> 02:07:11,230
Ah, yeah, I know.

2037
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:13,470
Sorry.
[inhales deeply]

2038
02:07:13,540 --> 02:07:15,380
It's my mom's car.

2039
02:07:15,460 --> 02:07:16,460
[chuckles softly]

2040
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:19,510
Have you been following us?

2041
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:22,290
[chuckling] No, but that's
what I love about Austin--

2042
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:24,630
it's just so damn small.

2043
02:07:24,700 --> 02:07:27,330
- You have seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.

2044
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:29,810
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.

2045
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:33,470
You saw my car,
I saw your legs.

2046
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:37,120
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

2047
02:07:37,190 --> 02:07:39,160
So you really weren't following us?

2048
02:07:39,230 --> 02:07:43,070
I'm not following you, Butterfly.
I just... got lucky.

2049
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:49,240
So, how about that lap dance?

2050
02:07:49,710 --> 02:07:51,450
Sorry, it was a one-time only offer,

2051
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:53,890
and she did it
earlier this evening at Antone's.

2052
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:57,390
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?

2053
02:07:57,460 --> 02:07:59,490
I'm good that way.

2054
02:07:59,570 --> 02:08:03,370
- Tsk. And you look a little touchd.
- What's "touchd"?

2055
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:04,630
Wounded, slightly.

2056
02:08:04,710 --> 02:08:05,710
Why should I be wounded?

2057
02:08:06,050 --> 02:08:09,020
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,

2058
02:08:09,090 --> 02:08:11,850
but from your look I can tell
nobody pestered you at all.

2059
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:15,300
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?

2060
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:21,780
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.

2061
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:28,780
So... [sighs]

2062
02:08:28,780 --> 02:08:30,890
How about that lap dance?

2063
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:35,970
I think I'm going
to have to give you a rain check.

2064
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:41,350
Well, since you will be leaving
in the next couple of days,

2065
02:08:41,420 --> 02:08:43,410
that rain check will be worthless.

2066
02:08:45,690 --> 02:08:46,490
But that's okay.

2067
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:50,860
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.

2068
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:53,540
You are still a nice girl.

2069
02:08:53,610 --> 02:08:55,410
And I still like you.

2070
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:58,980
But I must warn you of something.

2071
02:09:00,190 --> 02:09:02,680
You know how people say,

2072
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:04,460
"You are okay in my book, "

2073
02:09:04,530 --> 02:09:06,300
or, "In my book, that's no good. "

2074
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:11,870
Well, I actually have a book.

2075
02:09:13,620 --> 02:09:17,520
And everybody
I ever meet goes in this book.

2076
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:21,590
And now I have met you,
and you are going in the book.

2077
02:09:21,930 --> 02:09:22,940
[Butterfly chuckles]

2078
02:09:23,470 --> 02:09:25,270
Except...

2079
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:27,970
I'm afraid I must file you...

2080
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:31,480
under...

2081
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:33,080
"Chicken Shit."

2082
02:09:33,150 --> 02:09:35,450
And what if I did it?

2083
02:09:35,530 --> 02:09:37,790
Well, I definitely couldn't
file you under "Chicken Shit, "

2084
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:39,960
then, now, could I?

2085
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:41,230
What's your name again?

2086
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:45,640
- Stuntman Mike.
- Well, Stuntman Mike...

2087
02:09:45,710 --> 02:09:47,270
I'm Butterfly.

2088
02:09:47,350 --> 02:09:51,840
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

2089
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:53,260
Yeah, it is.

2090
02:09:53,760 --> 02:09:54,550
[quietly]
Yeah.

2091
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:58,070
Well, why don't you go
get ready for your lap dance?

2092
02:10:00,190 --> 02:10:01,190
[sighs]

2093
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:12,810
I'm driving.

2094
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:13,540
[chattering]

2095
02:10:14,070 --> 02:10:16,260
We are gonna go somewhere else,
gonna go hang out.

2096
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:17,440
Ready to go?

2097
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:18,420
Yeah.

2098
02:10:18,590 --> 02:10:20,360
- Bye.
BOTH: Bye.

2099
02:10:23,630 --> 02:10:25,640
I think you got Mike laid tonight.

2100
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:26,900
[both laugh]

2101
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:29,440
Looking good, Cannonball Run!

2102
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:32,520
He's just giving me a ride.

2103
02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:33,390
Oh, no doubt.

2104
02:10:33,690 --> 02:10:35,400
Have a nice ride!

2105
02:10:35,810 --> 02:10:36,810
[both laughing]

2106
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:39,260
Look, double fucks.

2107
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:41,700
[both tittering]

2108
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:45,480
I am not gonna fuck him.

2109
02:10:45,550 --> 02:10:46,350
I can hear you.

2110
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:47,680
[laughing]

2111
02:10:48,420 --> 02:10:51,910
- He's old enough to be my dad.
- I can still hear you.

2112
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:53,310
[both laugh again]

2113
02:10:54,690 --> 02:10:55,390
Bye.

2114
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:57,200
Bye-bye!

2115
02:10:59,210 --> 02:11:00,210
[both lightly chuckle]

2116
02:11:03,850 --> 02:11:05,820
Wow, that's fucking scary.

2117
02:11:05,890 --> 02:11:07,910
Yeah, well, I wanted it
to be impressive and...

2118
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:10,020
[sniffs]
scary tends to impress.

2119
02:11:11,460 --> 02:11:12,270
Is it safe?

2120
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:14,670
No, it's better than safe.

2121
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:16,370
It's death-proof.

2122
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:18,980
How do you make a car death-proof?

2123
02:11:19,050 --> 02:11:20,840
Well, that's what stuntmen do.

2124
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:23,550
You have seen a movie where
a car gets into some smash-up

2125
02:11:23,620 --> 02:11:26,060
there ain't no way in hell
any body's walking away from?

2126
02:11:26,130 --> 02:11:27,130
Yeah.

2127
02:11:27,200 --> 02:11:29,690
Well, how do you
think they accomplish that?

2128
02:11:29,770 --> 02:11:31,150
- CGI?
- [laughs]

2129
02:11:31,870 --> 02:11:35,810
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays
more often than not, you are right.

2130
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:38,150
Tsk. But back
in the all-or-nothing days...

2131
02:11:38,220 --> 02:11:42,020
'Vanishing Point' days,
the 'Dirty Mary Crazy Larry' days,

2132
02:11:42,090 --> 02:11:43,750
the 'White Line Fever' days...

2133
02:11:43,830 --> 02:11:46,260

2134
02:11:46,870 --> 02:11:48,440
Real dumb people driving them.

2135
02:11:49,570 --> 02:11:52,600
So, give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,

2136
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:55,240
they take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere and...

a death-proof automobile.

2139
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:04,960
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you could make a car death-proof.

2140
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:08,840
Well, I can drive this baby into
a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour.

2141
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:10,480

Well, this is a movie car.

2146
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:25,190
Sometimes when you are shooting a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car--

2147
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:27,540
you know, shoot the crash
from the inside.

2148
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:30,320
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a "crash box."

2152
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:37,330
You know, when you
asked to drive me home,

2153
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,300
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.

2154
02:12:39,370 --> 02:12:42,370
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.

2155
02:12:42,450 --> 02:12:44,350
You asked me for a ride,
and I said, "Yes. "

2156
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:45,410
But look at the bright side, Pam--

2157
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:48,790
I won't be getting fresh,
putting my hand on your knee.

Well, Pam...

2168
02:13:22,130 --> 02:13:22,930
which way are you going?

2169
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:24,960

- Right.

Ah, that's too bad.

2171
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:28,800
Why?

2172
02:13:29,110 --> 02:13:32,980
Well, because it was a 50/50 shot
on whether you would be going left or right.

2173
02:13:33,050 --> 02:13:35,180
You see, we are both going left.

2174
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:37,240
You could have just
as easily been going left, too,

2175
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:38,120
and if that was the case,

2282
02:20:41,310 --> 02:20:43,040
He was real lucky.

2283
02:20:43,230 --> 02:20:44,230
[chuckles]

2284
02:20:45,250 --> 02:20:47,010
That will be all?

2285
02:20:47,090 --> 02:20:50,390
Well, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.

2286
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:55,120
[grunts]
Son of a bitch.

2287
02:20:57,270 --> 02:20:58,870
So, Pop.

2288
02:20:58,940 --> 02:21:00,470
What do you think?

2289
02:21:00,550 --> 02:21:02,380
Well, Son Number One,

2290
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:06,450
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

2291
02:21:07,660 --> 02:21:09,930
Well, give it a shot.

2292
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:13,030
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.

2293
02:21:13,110 --> 02:21:15,840
That ol' boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.

2294
02:21:15,910 --> 02:21:19,680
I mean, he used a car, not a hatchet,
but they are dead just the same.

2295
02:21:21,250 --> 02:21:22,780
Well, what are you gonna do?

2296
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:25,860
Not a goddamn thing.

2297
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:28,200
D.A. says there ain't no crime here.

2298
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:33,110
Every one of them gals was swimming
in alcohol and floating on weed,

2299
02:21:34,110 --> 02:21:37,990
and old Hooper in there
came out clean as a whistle.

2300
02:21:38,060 --> 02:21:42,060
Now, you actually think that he
premeditating murdered them gals?

2301
02:21:42,530 --> 02:21:44,300
Well, I can't prove it.

2302
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:47,530
But since thinking don't cost nothing,
I can think it, and I do.

2303
02:21:47,610 --> 02:21:50,980
Yeah, but Pop, he got
pretty banged up himself.

2304
02:21:51,050 --> 02:21:53,580
Well, hell yeah,
he got banged up, but goddamn--

2305
02:21:53,650 --> 02:21:56,390
I mean, them pretty little gals in there
look like a goddamn giant

2306
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:58,160
chewed them up and spit them out.

2307
02:21:58,230 --> 02:21:59,030
Did any of them survive?

2308
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:01,570
[scoffs]
Shit.

2309
02:22:01,640 --> 02:22:04,110
Two tons of metal,
200 miles an hour,

2310
02:22:04,170 --> 02:22:06,580
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton--

2311
02:22:06,650 --> 02:22:08,740
they all princess died.

2312
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:12,850
Why?

2313
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:14,080
[shutter clicks]

2314
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:17,730
EARL: Well, I would guesstimate
it's a sex thing.

2315
02:22:18,310 --> 02:22:20,300
The only way I can figure it.

2316
02:22:20,380 --> 02:22:24,380
High-velocity impact,
twisted metal, busted glass,

2317
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:28,650
all four souls taken
exactly the same time.

2318
02:22:29,650 --> 02:22:33,530
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.

2319
02:22:33,630 --> 02:22:34,850
[clicks]

2320
02:22:39,700 --> 02:22:41,730
Your timing couldn't be better, Zoe.

2321
02:22:41,810 --> 02:22:45,810
It just so happens we are all three
off-duty for the next three days.

2322
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:48,700
Fucking hell! How does that happen?

2323
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:52,020
I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days.

2324
02:22:52,090 --> 02:22:54,960
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free,

2325
02:22:55,030 --> 02:22:59,040
and Lee's on a will-notify
for the next four days.

2326
02:22:59,210 --> 02:23:00,770
So how the hell's the shoot going?

2327
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:02,910
Great. We are having the best time.

2328
02:23:02,980 --> 02:23:05,080
The director, Cecil Evans, is so much fun.

2329
02:23:05,150 --> 02:23:08,390
We are making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.

2330
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:12,060
Hell, yeah. The next job
after this one is definitely gonna suck.

2331
02:23:12,130 --> 02:23:14,040
So let's hear it, ladies.

2332
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:16,510
Set romances! Who's getting it off?

2333
02:23:16,580 --> 02:23:18,840
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

2334
02:23:19,070 --> 02:23:22,210
Oh, Toolbox!
Name sounds promising.

2335
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:24,440
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.

2336
02:23:24,590 --> 02:23:26,890
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.

2337
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:28,970
What's his perversion?

2338
02:23:31,270 --> 02:23:33,710
He likes to watch me pee.

2339
02:23:34,280 --> 02:23:38,280
# Lee is sitting on a toilet
and Toolbox is watching her pee #

2340
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:40,880
# P-l-S-S-l-N-G #

2341
02:23:40,960 --> 02:23:41,770
Ooh!

2342
02:23:42,260 --> 02:23:43,990
Yeah, but not no more.

2343
02:23:44,060 --> 02:23:46,300
Now she's getting it on
with the Rock.

2344
02:23:46,370 --> 02:23:48,240
You had a one-off with the Rock?

2345
02:23:48,310 --> 02:23:50,600
Well, not the real Rock.
He's this electrician named Bruce.

2346
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:53,020
And Kim started calling him the Rock,
'cause he kinda looks like the Rock,

2347
02:23:53,250 --> 02:23:54,480
so now we all just call him the Rock.

2348
02:23:55,120 --> 02:23:57,560
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it!

2349
02:23:57,630 --> 02:24:00,910
Mm-mmm, no dick this trip.
I got a man.

2350
02:24:01,070 --> 02:24:04,300
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.

2351
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:06,010
Who would you steal him from?

2352
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:06,880
Nobody!

2353
02:24:07,450 --> 02:24:08,510
ABBIE: Kim!
- Wha--what?

2354
02:24:10,090 --> 02:24:11,750
He totally had a girlfriend.

2355
02:24:11,820 --> 02:24:15,460
ZOE: All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

2356
02:24:15,530 --> 02:24:17,630
I did not steal him!

2357
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:21,710
I didn't steal any of them;
they just... jumped ship.

2358
02:24:22,750 --> 02:24:23,750
[girls snorting]

2359
02:24:25,080 --> 02:24:28,850
- So what's your story, Abernathy?
- Oh, Abbie's got the big Kahuna.

2360
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:30,160
I had a set crush on Cecil.

2361
02:24:31,730 --> 02:24:35,070
Set crush? Nigga, please.
You were his set wife!

2362
02:24:35,140 --> 02:24:37,370
"Were" and "had" being
the key words, here.

2363
02:24:37,440 --> 02:24:40,140
Bitch, you two are still
into each other and you know it.

2364
02:24:40,210 --> 02:24:44,720
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,
why did he fuck Darryl Hannah's stand-in?

2365
02:24:44,870 --> 02:24:48,210
[all snorting and cackling]

2366
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:51,960
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!

2367
02:24:52,610 --> 02:24:53,410
Oh, it's so funny!

2368
02:24:54,140 --> 02:24:56,400
Stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.

2369
02:24:56,750 --> 02:24:58,550
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.

2370
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:01,590
Bitch, You need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.

2371
02:25:01,660 --> 02:25:04,120
Oh, well, now you put it like that...

2372
02:25:05,470 --> 02:25:07,870
Oh, I haven't told you the best part.

2373
02:25:07,940 --> 02:25:11,020
He fucked her on my birthday.

2374
02:25:11,110 --> 02:25:13,580
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.

2375
02:25:14,020 --> 02:25:16,880
- Thank you.
- Did he know it was your birthday?

2376
02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:19,560
I mean, he's the director.
He's kind of busy.

2377
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:23,760
He ate a piece of my birthday cake,
and he got me a present.

2378
02:25:24,270 --> 02:25:26,260
- [whispers] Wow.
- Yeah... I think he knew.

2379
02:25:27,940 --> 02:25:28,740
What did he get you?

2380
02:25:33,020 --> 02:25:33,820
He made me a tape.

2381
02:25:34,660 --> 02:25:36,290
He made you a tape?

2382
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:38,590
- [shrieks]
- Wait, he didn't burn you a CD?

2383
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:39,470
He made you a tape?

2384
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:42,600
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic!

2385
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:46,270
Yes, I know what you are gonna say,
so don't even go there.

2386
02:25:46,350 --> 02:25:48,370
This sounds like the test
of true love to me.

2387
02:25:48,450 --> 02:25:52,150
Look, I know you guys like him.
He's likeable.

2388
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:54,820
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.

2389
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:56,800
How can you not be on my side?

2390
02:25:57,340 --> 02:25:58,510
I admit, that sounds bad.

2391
02:25:58,720 --> 02:25:59,710
It is bad!

2392
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:03,110
It just sounds like there's
a little more to it than that.

2393
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:03,980
Were you two fucking?

2394
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:05,220
Hell, no.

2395
02:26:05,990 --> 02:26:07,660
Hello, is your name Abernathy?

2396
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:09,090
Sorry.

2397
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:12,470
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.

2398
02:26:12,630 --> 02:26:15,190
What do you mean "No, of course not"?

2399
02:26:15,710 --> 02:26:18,700
The reason Cecil hasn't had
a girlfriend in six years

2400
02:26:18,780 --> 02:26:22,080
is because girls will fuck him,
and if you fuck Cecil,

2401
02:26:22,150 --> 02:26:24,420
you don't become one
of his girlfriends--

2402
02:26:24,490 --> 02:26:26,740
not to say I want to be his girlfriend,

2403
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:32,460
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,
if I fucked him, I wouldn't be.

2404
02:26:32,770 --> 02:26:38,300
I would be one of his regulars,
and I'm getting too fucking old for that shit.

2405
02:26:38,520 --> 02:26:41,550
- Have you let him do anything?
- Yes!

2406
02:26:43,430 --> 02:26:45,330
I have let him give me a foot massage,

2407
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:48,550
and when we go to the movies,
I have let him hold my hand.

2408
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:52,070
Bitch, you might be acting
like you 12 years old,

2409
02:26:52,080 --> 02:26:53,670
but he just acting like a man.

2410
02:26:53,750 --> 02:26:55,840
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.

2411
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:56,720
Let me get this straight--

2412
02:26:58,290 --> 02:27:01,590
you are not fucking him,
you are not sucking him,

2413
02:27:01,660 --> 02:27:05,540
you are not giving him any tongue,
but Darryl Hannah's stand-in is?

2414
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:08,580
You know some cultures might say
he made the wiser choice.

2415
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,800
[all laughing]

2416
02:27:14,390 --> 02:27:17,830
So Zoe, Kim, and I are
in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.

2417
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:21,240
- LEE: What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head. Part Three.

2418
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:24,740
And, admittedly,
we are a little fucked up.

2419
02:27:24,810 --> 02:27:27,080
- ZOE: (giggling] Cheers to that.
- Word.

2420
02:27:27,780 --> 02:27:28,590
Cheers.

2421
02:27:29,090 --> 02:27:30,610
So Zoe...

2422
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:35,630
the genius, wants to take
a picture of me.

2423
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:36,760
[others laughing]

2424
02:27:36,770 --> 02:27:40,170
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.

2425
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:43,880
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying, "Step back a little!"

2426
02:27:43,950 --> 02:27:44,750
So I do.

2427
02:27:45,090 --> 02:27:47,420
[imitating Zoe]
Then "A little fu -ther!"

2428
02:27:47,490 --> 02:27:51,500
So I step back a little fu -ther.
Then "A little more!" So I do.

2429
02:27:52,230 --> 02:27:56,240
Then I realize I'm at the edge
of a seven-foot concrete ditch...

2430
02:27:58,250 --> 02:28:00,680
[others cracking up]
... with God knows how many rocks

2431
02:28:00,750 --> 02:28:04,750
and broken bottles and rats in it,
and if I fell in that fucking thing,

2432
02:28:05,060 --> 02:28:07,050
I probably would have broken my neck.

2433
02:28:07,130 --> 02:28:10,860
So I am yelling at her:
"Zoe, you almost killed me!"

2434
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:16,550
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,

2435
02:28:16,650 --> 02:28:17,680
and Zoe starts fucking around.

2436
02:28:19,250 --> 02:28:23,260
And... bam!... if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch!

2437
02:28:24,830 --> 02:28:26,600
LEE: Nice.

2438
02:28:26,670 --> 02:28:28,810
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.

2439
02:28:30,440 --> 02:28:32,910
I remember taking a step
and looking down,

2440
02:28:32,980 --> 02:28:36,550
just as I'm thinking, "There's that ditch
Abbie was talking about. "

2441
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:38,990
Bam! I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.

2442
02:28:39,060 --> 02:28:40,010
What happened?

2443
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:42,870
What, with Zoe, the cat?

2444
02:28:42,930 --> 02:28:43,740
Nothing.

2445
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:48,040
If I fell in that fucking thing, they would
have had to helicopter me out of there.

2446
02:28:48,110 --> 02:28:50,410
Zoe just lands on her feet.

2447
02:28:50,480 --> 02:28:54,490
But then later I started feeling
a little bad about myself--

2448
02:28:54,690 --> 02:28:59,810
Zoe falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
We are laughing about it.

2449
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:03,840
If I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have been paralyzed.

2450
02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:06,510
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.

2451
02:29:06,580 --> 02:29:10,420
We all have our individual talents,
and that just happens to be one of Zoe's.

2452
02:29:10,490 --> 02:29:14,490
Well, physically speaking,
Zoe is amazing.

2453
02:29:15,070 --> 02:29:17,950
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness?

2454
02:29:18,570 --> 02:29:21,700
There's few human beings that can fuck
with Zoe on that front.

2455
02:29:21,780 --> 02:29:23,810
Kim, I like you too.

2456
02:29:24,550 --> 02:29:28,560
Having said that, before you get
too envious of Zoe's prowess,

2457
02:29:29,090 --> 02:29:31,830
you are missing the most
important part of that story.

2458
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:35,020
You didn't fall in the ditch.
Zoe did.

2459
02:29:35,510 --> 02:29:39,410
Zoe even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,

2460
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:41,380
and she still fell in.

2461
02:29:41,450 --> 02:29:44,470
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

2462
02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:47,360
Hey, I resemble that remark.

2463
02:29:47,770 --> 02:29:49,160
[laughing]

2464
02:29:50,970 --> 02:29:53,070
So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?

2465
02:29:56,350 --> 02:29:58,180
Check it out, bitch.

2466
02:29:58,250 --> 02:30:00,620
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.

2467
02:30:00,690 --> 02:30:01,490
LEE: What's a Roscoe?

2468
02:30:01,960 --> 02:30:02,760
Roscoe's a pistol.

2469
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:06,030
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.

2470
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:08,100
You have a license to carry?

2471
02:30:08,170 --> 02:30:12,080
Yeah, when I became a Secret Service
agent, they gave me a license.

2472
02:30:12,810 --> 02:30:14,610
Oh, I didn't know you were...

2473
02:30:17,390 --> 02:30:21,400
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. God.

2474
02:30:22,570 --> 02:30:24,500
Did you know Kim carried a gun?

2475
02:30:24,570 --> 02:30:27,140
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.

2476
02:30:28,710 --> 02:30:30,740
Do I know? Yes.

2477
02:30:30,820 --> 02:30:34,480
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,

2478
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:37,430
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.

2479
02:30:37,500 --> 02:30:41,100
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns

2480
02:30:41,170 --> 02:30:43,900
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.

2481
02:30:43,980 --> 02:30:47,780
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down to the laundry room

2482
02:30:47,850 --> 02:30:50,760
at midnight enough times,
I might get my ass raped.

2483
02:30:50,820 --> 02:30:52,520
Don't do your laundry at midnight.

2484
02:30:52,590 --> 02:30:56,300
Fuck that! I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I want to.

2485
02:30:56,370 --> 02:31:00,370
There are other things you can carry
other than a gun. Pepper spray.

2486
02:31:00,710 --> 02:31:04,710
Uh, motherfucker trying to rape me,
I don't want to give him a skin rash.

2487
02:31:05,250 --> 02:31:07,050
I wanna shut that nigga down!

2488
02:31:08,930 --> 02:31:11,160
How about a knife, at least?

2489
02:31:11,230 --> 02:31:13,670
Yeah, you know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?

2490
02:31:15,570 --> 02:31:17,480
They get shot!

2491
02:31:17,540 --> 02:31:21,550
If I ever become a famous actress,
I won't carry a gun.

2492
02:31:21,650 --> 02:31:25,320
I will hire me a do-dirt nigga and he will
carry the gun, and when shit goes down,

2493
02:31:25,390 --> 02:31:28,800
I will sit back and laugh,
but until that day, it's Wild West.

2494
02:31:28,870 --> 02:31:32,430
So Zoe, you thought about
what you want to do first?

2495
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:37,780
It just so happens
I know exactly what I want to do.

2496
02:31:37,850 --> 02:31:39,790
Oh, really?
And what would that be?

2497
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:45,360
To me, there's no point in being in America
unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.

2498
02:31:46,140 --> 02:31:50,140
I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger--
fuck me swinging, balls out.

2499
02:31:50,430 --> 02:31:51,430
[laughing]

2500
02:31:53,380 --> 02:31:55,270
ABBIE: Well, I guess we
could talk to Transpo,

2501
02:31:56,020 --> 02:31:58,420
but does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?

2502
02:31:58,490 --> 02:32:02,860
Not just that. It has to be a 1970
Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.

2503
02:32:04,490 --> 02:32:06,490
[cackles]

2504
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:10,110
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?

2505
02:32:10,180 --> 02:32:10,980
No worries, mate.

2506
02:32:11,590 --> 02:32:13,820
I have got it all worked out.

2507
02:32:13,890 --> 02:32:17,130
When I knew I was coming here,
I went on-line and found out

2508
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:20,660
that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.

2509
02:32:20,740 --> 02:32:23,500
- So back home...
- I'm sorry, where's home? Australia?

2510
02:32:23,710 --> 02:32:24,710
[grunts]

2511
02:32:26,050 --> 02:32:28,250
What do you mean by that, mate?

2512
02:32:28,320 --> 02:32:31,360
Zoe's from New Zealand,
and you never--

2513
02:32:31,460 --> 02:32:34,920
I repeat, never--
call a Kiwi an Aussie.

2514
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,700
KIM: That is, unless
you want your ass kicked.

2515
02:32:39,610 --> 02:32:41,410
I'm so sorry. I will nev--

2516
02:32:41,560 --> 02:32:42,560
[others snorting]

2517
02:32:42,610 --> 02:32:44,170
Oh, it's okay.

2518
02:32:44,250 --> 02:32:47,350
We are just taking the piss
out of you, mate.

2519
02:32:47,420 --> 02:32:49,090
Auckland, to answer your question.

2520
02:32:50,660 --> 02:32:53,730
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.

2521
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:57,400
Why the fuck you want a local redneck
newspaper in New Zealand?

2522
02:32:57,480 --> 02:32:59,950
Pipe down and I will tell you.

2523
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:02,950
I have been getting the paper
and checking the classifieds,

2524
02:33:03,020 --> 02:33:04,620
looking at cars for sale,

2525
02:33:04,690 --> 02:33:09,290
so as of yesterday,
for sale in this town,

2526
02:33:09,430 --> 02:33:12,700
some dude is selling
a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger

2527
02:33:12,770 --> 02:33:16,070
with a 440 engine and a white paint job.

2528
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:18,410
KIM: And you wanna buy it?

2529
02:33:19,690 --> 02:33:23,360
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.

2530
02:33:23,430 --> 02:33:27,430
I wanna say I wanna buy it
so he will let me test-drive it.

2531
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:30,670
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?

2532
02:33:30,740 --> 02:33:32,300
Oh, uh, Kowalski!

2533
02:33:32,380 --> 02:33:36,150
Kowalski from 'Vanishing Point'.
Mate, it's a fucking classic!

2534
02:33:36,220 --> 02:33:37,440
If I can get this guy

2535
02:33:37,720 --> 02:33:41,600
to let me drive it without him,
I will blow the doors off that bitch.

2536
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:43,530
ABBIE: What's 'Vanishing Point'?

2537
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:46,610
What's 'Vanishing Point'?

2538
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:49,650
Abs, I'm supposed
to be the illiterate one.

2539
02:33:49,710 --> 02:33:52,690
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.

2540
02:33:52,750 --> 02:33:56,290
Actually, Zoe, most girls
wouldn't know 'Vanishing Point'.

2541
02:33:57,330 --> 02:34:01,330
Excuse me. Most girls?
What the fuck are you two?

2542
02:34:01,440 --> 02:34:04,930
Yeah, well, we are gearheads.
Of course we watched it.

2543
02:34:05,010 --> 02:34:07,380
Y'all grew up watching
that 'Pretty in Pink' shit.

2544
02:34:07,450 --> 02:34:09,780
Oh, I liked 'Pretty in Pink'.

2545
02:34:09,860 --> 02:34:12,330
What, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

2546
02:34:12,390 --> 02:34:16,400
Of course I did. I'm a girl.
But I also watched car shit, too...

2547
02:34:16,500 --> 02:34:19,200
'Vanishing Point'. 'Dirty Mary Crazy Larry'.

2548
02:34:19,270 --> 02:34:20,830
- 'Gone in 60 Seconds'...
- Oh...

2549
02:34:20,910 --> 02:34:23,880
The real one, not that
Angelina Jolie bullshit.

2550
02:34:23,950 --> 02:34:27,680
We have an outdoor theater in Auckland
that plays 'Vanishing Point'.

2551
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:28,950
'Big Wednesday'. all the classics.

2552
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:32,610
[honks]

2553
02:34:38,990 --> 02:34:39,990
[honking]

2554
02:34:46,860 --> 02:34:48,760
What do you horny gals want?

2555
02:34:48,810 --> 02:34:49,810
[door opens, slams]

2556
02:34:52,370 --> 02:34:55,670
Yeah, you got
a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?

2557
02:34:55,750 --> 02:34:57,170
Right up here, ladies.

2558
02:35:11,850 --> 02:35:14,410
This shit is off the fucking hook!

2559
02:35:14,990 --> 02:35:17,420
Fucking legendary, mate.

2560
02:35:19,660 --> 02:35:24,780
Sweet ass. Well, if you will excuse me,
I would like to have a word with my associate.

2561
02:35:25,070 --> 02:35:26,570
You ladies take your time.

2562
02:35:26,860 --> 02:35:28,640
[laughs creepily]

2563
02:35:29,330 --> 02:35:30,330
[moan]

2564
02:35:33,420 --> 02:35:36,490
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.

2565
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:39,160
I intend to, but first I need
to ask you something.

2566
02:35:39,230 --> 02:35:40,040
What?

2567
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:44,810
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play Ship's Mast.

2568
02:35:45,680 --> 02:35:47,410
- Oh, hell, no!
- Keep it down!

2569
02:35:47,480 --> 02:35:49,420
Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.

2570
02:35:49,490 --> 02:35:50,290
- For Chrissakes...
- Don't blaspheme.

2571
02:35:50,460 --> 02:35:51,140
Sorry.

2572
02:35:51,660 --> 02:35:54,570
Now, what did you say
after the last time?

2573
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:57,630
- Look, I know what I said.
- What did you say?

2574
02:35:57,700 --> 02:35:59,800
- I know I said we shouldn't...
- No.

2575
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:02,870
You didn't say we shouldn't.
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again.

2576
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:04,710
- But...
- But, my ass!

2577
02:36:04,790 --> 02:36:07,810
You said not only are we never
gonna play Ship's Mast again,

2578
02:36:07,890 --> 02:36:10,950
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now,

2579
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:16,040
to not only refuse, but that I had permission
to physically restrain your ass if necessary.

2580
02:36:16,150 --> 02:36:18,280
Now, did you or did you not say that?

2581
02:36:18,780 --> 02:36:22,050
No, no, no.
Answer the question, motherfucker.

2582
02:36:22,120 --> 02:36:25,560
- Did you or did you not say that?
- Yes, I said that.

2583
02:36:25,630 --> 02:36:27,560
- However...
- Whatever with your "however."

2584
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:31,570
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it--

2585
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:32,440
Damn skippy you meant it!

2586
02:36:32,940 --> 02:36:35,640
But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America!

2587
02:36:35,710 --> 02:36:37,740
- Oh, nigga, please.
- For real. Really.

2588
02:36:37,820 --> 02:36:41,820
I meant we should never play Ship's Mast
again in New Zealand or Australia.

2589
02:36:41,930 --> 02:36:43,620
You are such a liar!

2590
02:36:43,700 --> 02:36:49,190
I know what I said, but when I said it
I didn't know I would ever come to America,

2591
02:36:49,370 --> 02:36:52,780
and if I had of known
I was gonna come to America,

2592
02:36:52,850 --> 02:36:56,510
had the opportunity to play Ship's Mast
on the 'Vanishing Point' Challenger...

2593
02:36:56,590 --> 02:36:58,720
I would have added a "however. "

2594
02:36:59,490 --> 02:37:01,990
Right?

2595
02:37:05,970 --> 02:37:08,240
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.

2596
02:37:08,310 --> 02:37:12,320
However, just because
you talked yourself into some stupid shit

2597
02:37:13,260 --> 02:37:15,380
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.

2598
02:37:15,460 --> 02:37:18,690
You need two people to play Ship's Mast,
and I ain't playing.

2599
02:37:26,250 --> 02:37:28,380
I will be your best friend.

2600
02:37:28,450 --> 02:37:31,360
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of Planet Earth.

2601
02:37:31,730 --> 02:37:33,090
I will crack your back.

2602
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:35,060
You will crack it anyway.

2603
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:37,090
Well, of course I will crack it anyway.

2604
02:37:37,550 --> 02:37:41,390
But now, while I'm here,
I will be your back-cracking slave.

2605
02:37:41,700 --> 02:37:43,780
Whenever you want it, you have got it.
You don't even have to ask.

2606
02:37:44,580 --> 02:37:47,960
You just order me to do it, just be like,
"Bitch, get over here and get busy."

2607
02:37:53,450 --> 02:37:56,250
We are gonna see if this guy will let us
take the car out without him.

2608
02:37:56,320 --> 02:37:59,310
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we will be back in a moment.

2609
02:37:59,890 --> 02:38:00,830
What?

2610
02:38:00,960 --> 02:38:05,370
- I said we are gonna see if this guy will let--
- I heard what you said.

2611
02:38:05,720 --> 02:38:08,440
I just can't believe
what you said.

2612
02:38:10,180 --> 02:38:11,980
You two got some fucking balls.

2613
02:38:12,050 --> 02:38:12,850
What?

2614
02:38:13,550 --> 02:38:14,900
Don't play dumbass with me.

2615
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:20,140
I have been up all night, I'm still a little drunk,
and I have a hangover.

2616
02:38:20,200 --> 02:38:23,900
I should be in my hotel room, asleep,
not fucking around on Tobacco Road,

2617
02:38:23,970 --> 02:38:27,780
but because Zoe wanted to drive
some 'Vanishing Point' car, I'm here.

2618
02:38:27,850 --> 02:38:31,810
Now you two got the balls to ask me--
no, scratch that-- tell me

2619
02:38:31,890 --> 02:38:35,890
I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad
while the cool kids get to go out and play?

2620
02:38:36,460 --> 02:38:38,260
Bullshit on that.

2621
02:38:38,340 --> 02:38:40,360
- It ain't like that.
- What's it like, Kim?

2622
02:38:40,440 --> 02:38:44,350
You guys are our collateral.
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.

2623
02:38:44,410 --> 02:38:48,080
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.

2624
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:50,890
You are not gonna
want to do what we are doing.

2625
02:38:50,960 --> 02:38:51,760
What, drive a car?

2626
02:38:53,330 --> 02:38:54,130
We are doing more than that.

2627
02:38:54,500 --> 02:38:56,200
What, drive it fast?

2628
02:38:57,610 --> 02:38:59,270
We are doing more than that.

2629
02:38:59,340 --> 02:39:03,790
Actually, we are paying you a compliment,
'cause we gonna do some stupid shit.

2630
02:39:04,240 --> 02:39:05,240
[clears throat]

2631
02:39:05,790 --> 02:39:08,390
But that's okay. We are stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.

2632
02:39:08,460 --> 02:39:10,900
But you got good sense,
and anybody with good sense

2633
02:39:10,970 --> 02:39:13,940
- ain't gonna want to do what we are doing.
- How do you know?

2634
02:39:14,010 --> 02:39:16,070
'Cause you are a mum.

2635
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:16,940
Yeah.

2636
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:22,950
You know, we are supposed
to be this big posse,

2637
02:39:23,020 --> 02:39:26,930
but that's the excuse you guys use
whenever you want to exclude me,

2638
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,870
so what is it you two daredevils are doing

2639
02:39:29,940 --> 02:39:33,940
that I'm just so uncool
I couldn't possibly understand?

2640
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:36,680
You know, we are kind of conning this guy,

2641
02:39:36,750 --> 02:39:40,450
so maybe it's best if we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.

2642
02:39:40,530 --> 02:39:43,020
Besides...

2643
02:39:43,020 --> 02:39:45,430
he's probably not gonna
let us do it, anyway.

2644
02:39:48,310 --> 02:39:49,900
Okay, how about this?

2645
02:39:52,220 --> 02:39:55,230
I will talk him into it,
but I go along.

2646
02:39:56,560 --> 02:39:59,360
- How you gonna do that?
- That's my problem.

2647
02:40:00,130 --> 02:40:00,930
But don't worry.

2648
02:40:02,170 --> 02:40:04,230
[snorts] He will say yes.

2649
02:40:04,310 --> 02:40:05,990
What are you gonna do, blow him?

2650
02:40:06,510 --> 02:40:07,310
No.

2651
02:40:09,220 --> 02:40:11,100
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.

2652
02:40:11,370 --> 02:40:12,870
[laughing]

2653
02:40:15,560 --> 02:40:17,260
That's a good one.

2654
02:40:17,330 --> 02:40:18,130
Not really.

2655
02:40:19,740 --> 02:40:21,540
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?

2656
02:40:27,390 --> 02:40:28,370
Okay, Mama, listen up.

2657
02:40:28,860 --> 02:40:32,590
You wanna hang with the cool kids?
You got to be cool.

2658
02:40:32,660 --> 02:40:35,500
We take you along, you don't say shit.
You don't even say crap.

2659
02:40:35,570 --> 02:40:38,600
You just sit in the back, and I don't want
to hear a peep, you understand?

2660
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:39,810
- Got it.
- I'm serious, now.

2661
02:40:40,150 --> 02:40:43,980
You start nagging us, we pulling over,
kicking you out, and picking you up later.

2662
02:40:44,050 --> 02:40:45,270
Agreed.

2663
02:40:49,460 --> 02:40:52,050
Okay. Go work your magic.

2664
02:40:59,050 --> 02:41:00,640
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

2665
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:02,350
- Hello, what's your name?
- Jasper.

2666
02:41:02,420 --> 02:41:04,120
Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.

2667
02:41:04,190 --> 02:41:05,820
- Aber what?
- Abernathy.

2668
02:41:05,900 --> 02:41:08,300
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.

2669
02:41:08,370 --> 02:41:11,740
- What kind of first name is that?
- Just call me Abbie.

2670
02:41:11,810 --> 02:41:13,370
Okay, Abbie.

2671
02:41:14,510 --> 02:41:18,150
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I could take the car out

2672
02:41:18,220 --> 02:41:21,250
for a little test drive out on our own,
just to see if we are comfortable.

2673
02:41:21,250 --> 02:41:22,990
Why would I do something
stupid like that?

2674
02:41:23,060 --> 02:41:25,400
To better sell your automobile.

2675
02:41:25,470 --> 02:41:27,670
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?

2676
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:29,680
Four reasons, actually.

2677
02:41:29,740 --> 02:41:33,750
One, we are not thieves,
two, that would be rude,

2678
02:41:34,550 --> 02:41:37,220
three, we are staying
at the Days Inn in town--

2679
02:41:37,290 --> 02:41:40,890
you can call, check with management.
We are registered for the next month.

2680
02:41:40,970 --> 02:41:45,540
Actually, Zoe's not, but Kim and I are,
so we are totally track-downable.

2681
02:41:45,710 --> 02:41:47,440
Who's Kim? The colored girl?

2682
02:41:48,250 --> 02:41:51,230
Yes. Kim would be the girl of color.

2683
02:41:51,920 --> 02:41:54,320
And reason number four--
and the most important:

2684
02:41:54,390 --> 02:41:57,330
while we are taking the car out
for a little spin,

2685
02:41:57,400 --> 02:42:01,400
that will give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted with our other friend...

2686
02:42:02,710 --> 02:42:03,510
Lee.

2687
02:42:04,560 --> 02:42:05,560
[chuckles]

2688
02:42:07,150 --> 02:42:09,280
Why does she look
kind of familiar?

2689
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:12,350
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

2690
02:42:12,430 --> 02:42:13,240
Hmm.

2691
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:15,770
Why's she dressed like that?

2692
02:42:15,970 --> 02:42:19,140
Well, you see, we are making
a Hollywood movie in town,

2693
02:42:19,210 --> 02:42:22,150
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.

2694
02:42:22,220 --> 02:42:23,880
What's a cheerleader movie?

2695
02:42:23,950 --> 02:42:25,720
A movie about cheerleaders.

2696
02:42:26,860 --> 02:42:28,010
Is it a porno movie?

2697
02:42:29,860 --> 02:42:35,870
Yes, it is, but don't mention it. She's shy.

2698
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:38,560
[honks]

2699
02:42:40,090 --> 02:42:42,770
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.

2700
02:42:42,890 --> 02:42:45,490
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.

2701
02:42:45,700 --> 02:42:48,690
KIM: Hey, good-looking.
Be back to pick you up later.

2702
02:42:48,770 --> 02:42:49,570
ZOE: Ta-ta!

2703
02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:52,630
[revving]

2704
02:42:54,810 --> 02:42:56,900
[jasper chuckles slowly]

2705
02:43:00,460 --> 02:43:01,260
Gulp.

2706
02:43:16,460 --> 02:43:17,440
You thinking what I'm thinking?

2707
02:43:19,560 --> 02:43:20,450
I think I'm thinking it.

2708
02:43:21,030 --> 02:43:22,100
What are you and you thinking?

2709
02:43:22,600 --> 02:43:25,940
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

2710
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:30,710
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.

2711
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:31,590
I gotta take a--

2712
02:43:49,460 --> 02:43:51,260
So, you ready to do this?

2713
02:43:52,800 --> 02:43:53,600
You sure?

2714
02:43:53,930 --> 02:43:57,940
Well, I always don't want to do it
right before I'm gonna do it.

2715
02:43:58,680 --> 02:44:01,110
I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.

2716
02:44:01,180 --> 02:44:01,980
Kim!

2717
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:05,050
- I'm just saying.
- If you are gonna take the piss out of it...

2718
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:06,780
I'm just saying.

2719
02:44:08,230 --> 02:44:09,860
You wanna start out on top?

2720
02:44:11,300 --> 02:44:14,640
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.

2721
02:44:15,610 --> 02:44:17,670
[both laughing]

2722
02:44:18,780 --> 02:44:20,350
[unzips bag]

2723
02:44:20,350 --> 02:44:21,550
Here are your gloves.

2724
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:30,340
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing a jacket.

2725
02:44:31,110 --> 02:44:32,870
This is my jacket.

2726
02:44:32,940 --> 02:44:36,250
Um, ain't you supposed to be
my slave or some shit?

2727
02:44:37,350 --> 02:44:40,590
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the bonnet.

2728
02:44:40,660 --> 02:44:43,150
Bonnet, my ass.
You on the hood.

2729
02:44:45,490 --> 02:44:46,470
