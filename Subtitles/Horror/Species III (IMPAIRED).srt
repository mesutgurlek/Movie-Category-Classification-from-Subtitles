a new sequence of DNA

169
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,463
with rather friendly instructions

170
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,667
on how to combine it
with ours.

171
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,266
Here's some technical data.

172
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,438
You can get feedback on it
from Dr. Baker here.

173
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:19,473
Basically, the new combined
DNA sequence

174
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,449
was injected

175
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,955
into 100 human ova.

176
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,459
We got seven to divide--

177
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,996
four petered out,

178
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,428
two were stored
in liquid nitrogen,

179
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,697
and we allowed one to grow.

180
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,465
That's its
code name there-- Sil.

181
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,030
That's after two hours.

182
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,975
One day.

183
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:48,670
Two days.

184
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,443
- My God.
- This growth is amazing.

185
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,949
That's a week.

186
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,749
It's a girl.

187
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:56,788
Yes, l...

188
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,313
We decided to make it female

189
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,859
so it would be more
docile and controllable.

190
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,259
More docile and
controllable, huh?

191
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,059
I guess you guys
don't get out much.

192
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,865
That's her one month
after she was born.

193
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,462
So you kept her
caged...in there.

194
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,067
We decided it would be safer
to keep her in isolation.

195
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,608
She didn't like
being locked up like that.

196
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,375
She didn't like
being alone.

197
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,812
Didn't she?

198
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,486
She's hiding something,

199
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,580
something inside.

200
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,454
You're right, Dan.

201
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,925
This is three months
after she was born,

202
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:37,484
and you watch carefully.

203
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,359
Aah!

204
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,661
What the hell was that?

205
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,325
Back the tape up.

206
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:47,903
Watch her eyes.

207
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,941
Rapid eye movement.
She's dreaming.

208
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,999
Aah!

209
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,676
She's having
horrible nightmares.

210
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,909
It's some kind
of anxiety reaction.

211
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,507
Got me a little anxious.

212
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,486
It made the research team
a little anxious, too,

213
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,886
so the decision was made

214
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,479
to terminate the experiment,

215
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,889
to run more research

216
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,416
so that we could determine
what we were dealing with.

217
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,558
You were going to gas her?

218
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,567
That was the decision.

219
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,061
It makes you feel bad.

220
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,100
It makes you feel bad
you had to kill her.

221
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,573
I don't know.

222
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,847
Wow.

223
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:33,873
Yes.

224
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,481
Yesterday morning the body
of a transient was found

225
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,496
in a boxcar on a siding
near Salt Lake City.

226
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,691
Preliminary
DNA tests conclude

227
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,563
he was killed
by our creation,

228
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,034
by our Sil.

229
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,866
Have you found
other bodies?

230
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,496
No, we haven't. Not yet.

231
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,733
You will.
She's a predator.

232
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,536
Her eyes are in front.

233
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:58,940
Her eyes are in front

234
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,468
so she can judge the distance
to her prey.

235
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,844
That's right.

236
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,542
Where did you learn that fact?

237
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,484
I saw it on a documentary

238
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,883
on the Discovery Channel.

239
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,946
I caught that show myself.

240
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:13,891
Mr. Lennox.

241
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,517
Y eah.

242
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,925
As the, um...

243
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,485
well, the nonscientist
amongst us,

244
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,894
are you at all clear

245
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,193
about what's going on here?

246
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,492
Well, I think so.

247
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,900
You created a monster

248
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,997
with some kind
of formula you got

249
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,473
from outer space,

250
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,907
the damn thing got away,

251
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:36,437
and now you want us
to hunt it down and kill it.

252
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,607
Is that pretty close?

253
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:38,649
I guess.

254
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,048
Wait a minute.

255
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,814
You don't want us
to capture her alive

256
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,913
so that we can study her?

257
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,515
Laura, I think
this is strictly

258
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,992
a search-and-destroy
operation.

259
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,155
Nobody ever asked me
to find anything

260
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,892
they didn't want dead.

261
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,526
I'm sorry for you.

262
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,538
Y eah, well...
thank you, Dan.

263
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,065
I'm sorry for her.

264
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,109
Ladies and gentlemen,

265
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,113
may I have
your attention, please?

266
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:11,445
Welcome to Los Angeles,
California.

267
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:12,881
This is the terminal stop

268
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,475
for the Desert Star.

269
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,749
All passengers
please disembark.

270
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,004
[ Crying ]

271
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,512
This is
the final boarding call

272
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,526
for train number 12,
the Coast Runner,

273
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,960
to Santa Barbara,
San Jose,

274
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:01,590
San Francisco, Eugene,
and Seattle.

275
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,934
Something bad
happened here.

276
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:37,900
No shit.

277
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,334
Crushed her larynx.

278
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,902
She was afraid.

279
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,906
She's scared.
She's frightened.

280
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,568
Hungry, too,
by the looks of it.

281
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,236
She's been eating
like a horse.

282
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,339
Well, our girl
is definitely not on a diet.

283
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,551
She must be storing up calories
for something.

284
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,574
Any ideas?

285
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:56,954
Oh, my...

286
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,250
[ Coughs ]

287
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,889
Well, that's, uh...

288
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,327
that looks like
some sort of...

289
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,325
chrysalis.

290
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,826
Some kind of cocoon.

291
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,332
What are we looking for,
a giant moth?

292
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,299
Uh...if that is
a cocoon,

293
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,339
she'll be
fully grown now.

294
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,632
Fully grown.

295
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,903
Maybe that's how
she got by our people.

296
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,036
They were looking
for a child.

297
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,977
She is a child.

298
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,948
It stinks in here.

299
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,076
I'm going outside.

300
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:37,291
Get the conductor's l.D. and
credit card numbers on your computer.

301
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,922
There's no sign of them
on the train.

302
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,331
Let's assume
she took them with her.

303
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,958
I'll see to that.

304
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,935
She kills
if she feels threatened,

305
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,337
and she has no remorse
about it. None.

306
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,931
[ Arden ]
Of course, Los Angeles
is perfect for her.

307
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:53,945
It's a city of the future.
Anything goes.

308
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,379
Totally mobile population.
Everyone's a stranger.

309
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,378
Very little in this town

310
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,948
is taboo
or unacceptable.

311
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,282
Whatever she does,
no one's going to notice.

312
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,878
Y eah, well, whatever.

313
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,889
So Los Angeles is where

314
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,391
the battle's
going to be fought...

315
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,886
and won.

316
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,879
You look very pretty.

317
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,720
Do you have a hundred?

318
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:45,987
Here we are.

319
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,932
You ought to be more careful
with your money.

320
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,468
Not everybody's
as honest as me.

321
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,106
Are you foreign?

322
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,477
Do you speak English?

323
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,907
Yes.

324
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,972
Here. You keep this.

325
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,178
Oh, here.
Let me take this.

326
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,119
Be careful here.

327
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,020
Yes.

328
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,988
Watch your step.

329
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:34,911
Our laboratory, Visitor Base One,
is being moved

330
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,948
to some empty virus research labs
at the university.

331
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,382
They're moving our equipment
as we speak.

332
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,942
It'll be operational
by 8:00.

333
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,385

Call the paramedic!

667
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:16,751
Anybody got a phone?

668
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:23,982
If your homeward commute

669
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,688
takes you westbound on
the Santa Monica Freeway,

670
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,730
expect delays
for up to one hour.

671
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,762
The homeward drive
will be slow

672
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,228
for people heading
to Malibu.

673
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,540
The video enhancement
is not all that great.

674
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:41,600
How old do you think
she is? 20? 23?

675
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:43,168
Her reproductive system

676
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,736
should be fully developed.

677
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:48,376
Her biological clock
must be in hyperdrive.

678
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,317
She wants to have a baby.

679
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:52,446
If she manages
to have a child,

680
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,285
our problems
have just started.

681
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:55,723
If her offspring's male

682
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,726
and develops
at the same rate as Sil,

683
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,729
it could be capable
of reproduction in six months.

684
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,766
God knows how many females
it could impregnate.

685
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,789
Fitch.

686
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,703
You see, when a predatory species
is introduced

687
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,297
into a closed
ecological system,

688
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,741
the extinction of the weaker species
is inevitable.

689
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,778
They found
the murdered guy's BMW.

690
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,004
Ran out of gas
in Santa Monica.

691
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,343
And what is her name?

692
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:20,747
I don't know her name.

693
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,307
So who are you?

694
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,320
She didn't have
any l.D. on her.

695
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,754
Thought I'd come by
to make sure she's O.K.

696
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,188
You think
she's got insurance?

697
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,453
I don't know.
Put it on my credit card

698
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,721
for the time being.

699
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,763
And you don't know
her name.

700
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,798
Guys like you
are hard to find.

701
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,433
Get a lab workup
on that, stat.

702
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,368
Arrange to get her up
to X ray.

703
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,778
I want an X ray on this.

704
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,782
It looks like
a scapula fracture.

705
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,647
Respiratory technician to CCU.

706
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,517
Respiratory technician to CCU.

707
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:03,316
Your sh--

708
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,485
Your shoulder.

709
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,823
What's going on here?

710
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,169
Doctor,
we need you immediately.

711
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,333
A child burn victim
just came in.

712
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,706
What is going on here?

713
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,836
Jesus Christ!
Did you see her shoulder?

714
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,876
Doctor, please.

715
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,514
We need you
immediately.

716
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,382
You're O.K.

717
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:36,756
I'm O.K.

718
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,796
Well, I was sure you
were seriously injured.

719
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,353
I'm O.K.

720
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,423
You are.
It's a miracle.

721
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,765
Can we go?

722
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:48,805
Did the doctor say
you could go?

723
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:49,839
Yes.

724
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,608
We'll send somebody
over there.

725
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,136
A report's come in.

726
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,148
A doctor over
at Parkbay Hospital

727
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:00,877
called in
with some weird story.

728
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,313
We should check it out.

729
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:07,117
Laura, Press, take a car.
Check it out.

730
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,124
Parkbay Hospital?

731
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,159
Y eah, Parkbay.

732
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,560
She walked.

733
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,126
She walked.

734
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:18,900
She walked that way.

735
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,570
Not too long ago.

736
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,647
Got some fruit
and cheese here.

737
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,582
What is that?

738
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,177
What do you mean,
the hot tub?

739
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,620
Hot tub.

740
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,179
I love this place.

741
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,590
It's away from the traffic
and the business

742
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,184
and all the people.

743
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,197
Sometimes it feels like
you're not in L.A. anymore.

744
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,198
Here.

745
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:50,859
We'll immortalize
the moment.

746
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,339
Look at the camera.
