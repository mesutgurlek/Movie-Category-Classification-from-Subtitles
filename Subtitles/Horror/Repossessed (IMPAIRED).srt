I am father mayii.

And I would like to welcome
you to the seminar.

89
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:58,097
I am here to discuss
an incident in my life

90
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,300
That first destroyed,

91
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,807
And then renewed my belief
in divine intervention.

92
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,812
17 years ago, a young girl
was a victim of an episode

93
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,782
Of demonic possession,

94
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,717
And I was called in
to rescue her soul.

95
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,922
Now, that battle left me
broken physically,

96
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,022
And mentally...

97
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,726
But recently,

98
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,761
My faith has been renewed.

99
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,732
And I believe that even the
most cynical among you here

100
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,635
Will... Find...

101

it was at the dinner table

That these stories

I guess that means
that you and I have gone

00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,035
From being friends
to being enemies.

However, you are

a billion followers?

502
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,058
Big deal. So does
the wheel of fortune.

So, don't try to impress me

I hate all forms

I don't need

If you really

Then why don't
you prove it?

How about you do
something supernatural?

Mayii: As father brophy drove
from the aglet home,

A great fear welled up
within him

Over there!

1320
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:34,778
Ohh, what'd I do
to deserve this?!

1321
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,015
* watch them now,
here they come *

1322
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:39,717

00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:58,235
Ah, what's the matter?

1329
00:58:58,267 --> 00:59:02,306
Can't take the heat,
rookie? Ha ha ha!

1330
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:03,540
Ahh!

1331
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:08,879
I, the all-powerful
prince of darkness,

1332
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:11,715
Command all that is evil

1333
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:15,752
To unite as one
in my presence... Now!

1334
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:17,021
Ha ha ha ha!

1335
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,355
[Thunder]

1336
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,889
Ah, yes!

1337
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:22,092
Not bad, eh?

1338
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:23,326
Now watch,

1339
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,730
Through the use
of modern electronics,

1340
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:28,031
As I turn millions
of your couch potatoes

1341
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,801
Into my disciples!
Ha ha ha!

1342
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,171
Yes!

1343
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:37,141
Freeze, pukeface!

1344
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:39,809
Think you're man enough
for a real challenge?

1345
00:59:39,844 --> 00:59:42,713
A challenge?
From you?

1346
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:45,014
Oh, don't make me laugh.
My skin will crack.

1347
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,383
Not me... Mayii.

1348
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:49,086
Mayii?!

1349
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,855
Oh, that old geezer
stopped slinging

1350
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,388
Holy water years ago.

1351
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:54,891
Not before he kicked
your slimy butt.

1352
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,392
No way!

1353
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:58,061
I-I could've taken him.

1354
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:00,130
The fight was fixed.

1355
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:01,766
I want a rematch!

1356
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,032
You got it.

1357
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,638
[Thunder]
Ha ha ha!

1358
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:09,239
This is it, America!

1359
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,207
The event you've all
been waiting for.

1360
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:12,910
Hi, I'm
mean gene okerlund,

1361
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,912
Along with Jesse
"the body" ventura,

1362
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,046
Bringing you the
ultimate confrontation

1363
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,281
Of good against evil.

1364
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,051
Now, there's
a man out there,

1365
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:24,754
Who many years ago

1366
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:29,893
Banished me from the
very soul I now possess.

1367
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:32,930
He humiliated me!

1368
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:37,000
And now, I've come back
to settle matters.

1369
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,203
And I'm not leaving

1370
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:43,072
Until I have his
stinking, rotten soul.

1371
01:00:43,106 --> 01:00:45,242
Father mayii!

1372
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:47,076
Where are you?

1373
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,413
I know you're watching.

1374
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:51,948
Because this is
Wednesday night,

1375
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,784
And everybody knows
the other networks

1376
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:56,787
Don't have dick
to watch tonight.

1377
01:00:56,821 --> 01:00:59,423
So, do we
do battle again?

1378
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:01,124
Or do you cherry out

1379
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,660
And let me keep
this soul forever?

1380
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,264
What do you say, mayii?

1381
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:09,766
[Whispering] No...

1382
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,136
No!

1383
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:15,740
By God, you may not!

1384
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,241
The belle from hell

1385
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:18,909
Versus the dove
from above

1386
01:01:18,942 --> 01:01:21,846
In a one-soul, anything
goes match-up, Jess.

1387
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,848
It doesn't get any better
than this, mean gene,

1388
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,816
But everyone knows
mayii's got a bad ticker.

1389
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:29,286
So Las Vegas oddsmakers
have listed him

1390
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,288
As a 25 to 1 underdog.

1391
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:57,173
You call this a tip,
you cheap bastard?!

1392
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:04,882
He doesn't stand
a shot in hell!

1393
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,053
Father brophy!
Luke!

1394
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,253
Luke!

1395
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,220
Father, what are you...

1396
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:12,555
Were you watching on TV?

1397
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:15,424
Yes. I had to come.
I had no choice.

1398
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,960
Well, what about
your heart?

1399
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,263
Don't worry about that.
I brought it with me.

1400
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,563
Father,
this could kill you.

1401
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:23,432
Yes. Yes, but that's
irrelevant.

1402
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:26,303
Satan is fighting
to take control here.

1403
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:27,937
Well, I'm not
so sure.

1404
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:29,572
Remember, his
opponent is a woman.

1405
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:31,108
Nice tits, sure,

1406
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,109
But a face
I wouldn't want to

1407
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,110
Wipe my feet on.

1408
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,243
Ever hear of a paper bag?

1409
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,112
My money's on mayii.

1410
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,882
Satan: Mayii!

1411
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,585
And they wonder
why priests

1412
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:44,454
Never get married.

1413
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,123
Now, Luke, I'm going
to need your assistance,

1414
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,426
But if you are still
lacking in faith,

1415
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:52,128
You may be more harm
than good.

1416
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,597
Are you?
No way.

1417
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,465
You can count on me.
Good.

1418
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,434
Now, just remember
one thing:

1419
01:03:57,467 --> 01:03:59,302
The devil is
always trying

1420
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,470
To take over your mind.

1421
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:03,007
He'll lie to you,
he will deceive you.

1422
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,241
He will totally try
to manipulate you.

1423
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,311
So do not listen
to anything

1424
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,644
That he has to say.

1425
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,146
He's worse than
a studio executive.

1426
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,314
Understood?
Understood.

1427
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,615
Worse than
a real estate agent,

1428
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,151
A divorce attorney...

1429
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,285
I got it.
Right.

1430
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,553
All right, then.

1431
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:21,926
Let's go.

1432
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:31,468
[Imitating Carol ann]
They're here...

1433
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,635
Ah...

1434
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:36,040
I see it pays to advertise
on television.

1435
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:39,509
I think a little mood
lighting is appropriate.

1436
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,378
Don't you?

1437
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:42,579
There.

1438
01:04:42,611 --> 01:04:44,680
Have no fear,
my son.

1439
01:04:44,713 --> 01:04:48,485
We have the Bible,
we have our faith.

1440
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:52,456
And as a back-up,
these beauties.

1441
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:55,191
That's an illegal
foreign object!

1442
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,360
Jesse, what do you
know about fairness?

1443
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,430
I'll show you fairness!

1444
01:05:00,464 --> 01:05:03,332
Are you just
about finished?

1445
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,202
It's been
a long time, mayii.

1446
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:10,206
I've waited an eternity
to do to you

1447
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,979
What you did to me
all those years ago.

1448
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:20,217
Before I do,
I've got something...

1449
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,452
Special for you.

1450
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:36,466
That is disgusting,
mean gene!

1451
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,301
I have never seen
a move like that

1452
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,070
In all my years
of wrestling!

1453
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:41,038
Whew!

1454
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,409
So...

1455
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,412
How do you like it?

1456
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:52,415
Oh, you'll pay for that,
you bucket of cow dung.

1457
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,749
How dare you, you...

1458
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:55,418
How long has she
been in this condition?

1459
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,554
A few days.
How does look?

1460
01:05:57,587 --> 01:05:59,422
Not too good.
She looks like

1461
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:02,626
She's been existing
solely on airline food.

1462
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:03,960
Your father wears
tight underwear!

1463
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,729
And I can't stand
your mother!

1464
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,598
Will you put
a sock in it?!

1465
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:12,469
Jeez, what crawled up
your butt and died?

1466
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,737
Every night I prayed

1467
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:18,141
To never again gaze
on your grotesque face,

1468
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,777
Listen to your
venomous voice,

1469
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:23,280
But with you right
in front of me now,

1470
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,615
I thank God that I have
the opportunity

1471
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:29,752
To boot your stinking
carcass back to hell,

1472
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:32,789
You worthless,
you rotting,

1473
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:35,258
You vulgar spirit.

A girl Nancy *

* would she get away?
Or could she? Can she *

1806
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:44,007
* find a way out?
I doubt *

1807
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,342
* if she could,
'cause the devil's all about *

1808
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:50,312
* evil power ruling intended,
bad intentions always demented *

* like a madman through a crowd
with a 12-gauge *

1828

* up pea soup all over
a priest's suit *
