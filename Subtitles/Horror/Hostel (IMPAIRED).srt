1
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,770
-Amsterdam, motherfucker.
-Okay.

2
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,610
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?

3
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,690
<i>Red-light district. Time for sneepur.</i>

4
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,370
<i>Let's go to the coffee shop first,
then get some sneepur.</i>

5
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,690
Hey, I think the Anne Frank
house is around here.

6
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,450
Did we come to Europe
just to smoke pot?

7
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,050
I came all the way from Iceland.

8
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,730
-Yeah, what if we did?
-We did that every day in college.

9
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,970
Why not, like, you know,
check out a museum?

10
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,010
No, you're right.
We should go to a museum.

11
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,370
How about the hemp museum?

12
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,290
Oli proudly presents...

13
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,810
...Isabella.

14
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,170
She's cute.

15
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,570
But we can't rail a girl
who's in a coma.

16
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,890
I think that's illegal
even in Amsterdam.

17
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,850
-Hey, I'm just warming up, man.
-Fucking Oli.

18
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,050
The Icelandic...
Oh, God, how are you?

19
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,850
You want to get stoned?

20
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,770
<i>-This will wake you up.
-What the fuck?</i>

21
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,210
This is good Amsterdam shit.

22
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,570
That's the shit right there, dude.

23
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,370
Trust me.

24
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,210
Yeah.

25
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,290
-It's all good, bro.
-Yeah, dude, smoke it!

26
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,650
-Dude, what happened?
-Any Dutch people in Amsterdam?

27
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,730
All right, this is my friend, Josh.

28
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,090
-Well, hello.
-Hi.

29
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,890
-Do you guys want another round?
-Yes, okay.

30
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,490
Yeah?

31
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,330
We will be right back.

32
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,730
-What are you doing?
-What?

33
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,890
Do you see a single other person
in here with a fucking fanny pack?

34
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,010
Wait. There's a guy.

35
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,410
Why don't you go have
fanny-pack sex with him...

36
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,050
...and jizz all over each other's
storage compartments?

37
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,090
I can't put my passport in my pocket.
It chafes my thighs, bitch.

38
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,930
-All right?
-Yeah.

39
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,210
Where's Oli?

40
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,050
He's fucking genius.

41
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,370
<i>Sneepur alert, 3 o'clock.</i>

42
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,690
-She smokes.
-Dude, it's Europe!

43
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,090
Every fucking chick smokes.
Stop being a pussy.

44
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,090
You are so easy sometimes.

45
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,490
The power of the pack is yours.
I'm out of here.

46
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,170
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,490
Yeah, I...
No, I don't even speak Dutch.

48
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,650
No, I'm sorry, I...

49
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,450
Get off me, you fucking
faggot-ass elf. Fuck off.

50
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,130
-Hey, what the fuck?
-Hey. Hey.

51
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,010
Come on, faggot.

52
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,770
-Fucker!
-Get your fucking hands off me.

53
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,330
-I'm an American, I got rights.
-Get the fuck out.

54
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,690
-Your fucking club sucks ass, bro.
-Kiss my American ass, fucker.

55
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,610
-Fuck you.
-Let's get out of here, bro.

56
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,650
Hey, I don't know why
you guys are waiting.

57
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,850
It's a fucking fag fest in there.
Wall-to-wall fucking cock.

58
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,330
You need one of these
to get in, bro. Sorry.

59
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,890
That shit was classic, dude.

60
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,930
He was gonna throw down
with a 400-pound Dutchman.

61
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,370
I'm fucking awesome!

62
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,290
I don't fucking know what...

63
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,170
I thought you were a Jew, man.
This guy's a fucking Israeli!

64
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,850
You are fucking Israeli.

65
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,610
Oh, God, I hope bestiality
is legal in Amsterdam...

66
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,650
...because that girl's a fucking hog.
Look at that, man.

67
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,050
Hey, guys,
I think she likes me, man.

68
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,370
Oh, look at that.
Josh, my gift to you, man.

69
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:54,210
Thanks, but paying to do whatever
you want to someone isn't a turn-on.

70
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,610
How are you gonna get over your chick
if you don't bang some new pussy?

71
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,930
You can't go home
without getting some hot chick.

72
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,050
I agree, but I shouldn't
have to pay for it.

73
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,170
Hey, come on, I'm paying, man.

74
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,490
Hey.

75
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,850
Are you okay?

76
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,650
Hello? Hello?

77
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,490
Hey, close the door.
You watch, you pay.

78
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,290
Sorry. Jesus.

79
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,530
You're up, slugger.

80
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,810
Man, I'm fucking... I'm tired, man.
I can, like, barely stand up.

81
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,890
Josh, you want
to be a fucking writer?

82
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,730
How about some life experience,
right there in that room.

83
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,650
-What do we have in here?
-Hey, you watch, you pay.

84
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,130
I pay. I pay, man. Come on.

85
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,330
Hey.

86
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,530
Come, sit.

87
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,490
Your friends are so funny.

88
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,930
Yeah.

89
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,290
You can wash over here, by sink.

90
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,090
It was fine.

91
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,370
What do you mean? That bitch had
the best fucking tits in Amsterdam.

92
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,650
It was fine. It was whatever.

93
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,850
What was that?

94
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,850
-It's fucking after curfew, man.
-Curfew? What are we, 1 3?

95
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,450
Let us the fuck in,
we're freezing our balls off.

96
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,090
We paid to stay here.
They can't just, like, lock us out.

97
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,450
This is bullshit.

98
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,810
Hello?

99
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,490
Open the fucking door.

100
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,170
-What did you tell him?
-He just told them to let us in.

101
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,930
-Shut up!
-Jesus.

102
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,730
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking Americans.

103
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,650
Hey, I know what to do.

104
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,010
Shut up.

105
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,730
Hey, hey, guys. Up here.
Climb quickly.

106
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,930
Come on.

107
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,210
Go. Go, go, go.

108
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,010
Oh, don't mind them.

109
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,850
They are so fucked up they don't
know what planet they are on.

110
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,530
-Thanks, bro.
-It's no problem.

111
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,570
Not everyone
want to kill Americans.

112
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,090
Paxton.

113
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,250
Alexei. But call me Alex.

114
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,810
What's up, Alex.
This is Josh and Oli.

115
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,930
Guys, this is fucking awesome, man.

116
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,530
<i>I'm the first in line for sneepur.</i>

117
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,450
Oh, that's Icelandic for "clit. "

118
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,570
Clitoris or clitoris,
however you wanna say that.

119
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,770
Women have it.

120
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,810
It's, like, right near the labia.
Like, it hangs.

121
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,010
<i>Oh, yeah.
Very good sneepur in Iceland.</i>

122
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,490
-Yeah.
-Come on, guys, have a seat.

123
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,410
Where you travel to?

124
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,570
We started in Paris,
which is where we met this drifter.

125
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,290
Anyway, we went all over France...

126
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,250
...and then Switzerland, Belgium,
and now we're in Amsterdam.

127
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,810
Yeah, kind of over Amsterdam.
Way too many Americans.

128
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,890
Yeah, but Oli's got a friend
with a flat in Barcelona...

129
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,130
<i>...and he's supposed to hook us up
with some hot-ass senoritas.</i>

130
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,170
Looking for girls?

131
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,370
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

132
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,810
So talk to Alex.

133
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,730
He open up the pussy
all over the Europe.

134
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,010
I can help you.

135
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,770
Oh, shit.
Alex is a pimp, apparently.

136
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,930
Thanks, bro,
but I think we'll be okay.

137
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,490
-Yeah.
-Good.

138
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,930
You looking for girls like this?

139
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,690
These are fucking magnificent.

140
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,570
-Who the hell are these girls?
-You have to go east, my friend.

141
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,690
This is where the best girls are.

142
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,130
The best.

143
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,050
How far east?

144
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,050
You can go as far as Ukraine,
around Odessa.

145
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,010
These girls I met
at this one hostel in Slovakia...

146
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,690
...just outside Bratislava.

147
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,170
The girls there are so hot
you cannot believe it.

148
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,810
And they love anyone foreign,
especially American.

149
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,450
They hear your accent,
they fuck you.

150
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,650
So wait, this place
is near Bratislava?

151
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,890
Josh.

152
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,730
You won't find this hostel
in any guidebook.

153
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,890
Barcelona, so many Americans.

154
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,090
But Slovakia? No one there.

155
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,010
There is so much pussy, and because
of the war, there are no guys.

156
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,330
You go to this hostel,
you will have any girl you want.

157
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,970
They go crazy for any foreigner.

158
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,850
You just...

159
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,850
...take them.

160
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,410
Fuck, man.

161
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,210
Can't you keep your Viking ass
in your pants for, like, two seconds?

162
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,090
Hey, man, I shaved my ass
just for you.

163
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,250
-Okay, all right.
-My Viking balls too.

164
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,810
Okay, stop.

165
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,730
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,330
My daughter.

167
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,410
She miss her daddy,
and Daddy miss her.

168
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,130
Yeah, no problem, dude, it's cool.

169
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,770
-Saskia.
-Cute.

170
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,730
-She's adorable.
-She's a little cutie, yeah.

171
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,810
This is Svanhildur, my daughter.

172
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,450
-Very pretty.
-She's 6.

173
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,570
She's starting school this year.

174
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,050
Wait, you have a daughter?

175
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,930
Yeah, of course, my horse.
I was married for eight years.

176
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,570
Okay. All right.

177
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,370
-You are on vacation?
-Yeah, we're backpacking.

178
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,930
Our next stop is Bratislava.

179
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,370
-What?
-Slovakia.

180
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,010
You will like it.

181
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,490
Casino, girls.

182
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,490
You can pay to do anything.

183
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,330
Anything.

184
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,210
-How are the girls?
-Very beautiful.

185
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,570
They will love you.
Handsome American like you.

186
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,010
Handsome devil. He is handsome.

187
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,890
That's... That's awkward.
That's awkward.

188
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,010
That's awkward too.

189
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,650
-You need a fork there, chief?
-No, no, no.

190
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,210
I prefer to use my hands.

191
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,690
I believe...

192
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,650
...people have
lost their relationship with food.

193
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,290
They do not think:

194
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,970
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry. "

195
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,850
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

196
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,370
I appreciate it more.

197
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,890
Well, I'm vegetarian.

198
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,450
And I am a meat-eater.

199
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,450
It's human nature.

200
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,450
Well, I'm human,
and it's not in my nature.

201
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,010
Tell me, what is your nature?

202
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,130
Don't touch!
Don't fucking touch me!

203
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,130
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,890
Excuse me.

205
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,810
Fucking freak.

206
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,610
Jesus.

207
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,970
Edward Saladhands
just groped Josh.

208
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,730
Dude, you finally hooked up.
That's awesome.

209
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,210
Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.

210
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,330
Or we could visit some factories.

211
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,050
Should be cool.

212
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,930
In this area...

213
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,450
...we make plastic for Slovakia.

214
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,610
Is that so?

215
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,810
Look at this.

216
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,850
-Nice, eh?
-This is a fucking hostel?

217
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,130
Holy shit.

218
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,810
You can have that, man.
I'm too scared.

219
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,530
Hey, hey. The party has arrived.

220
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,290
-You are saved from boredom.
-Let me guess.

221
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,770
You must be
the King of the Swing.

222
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,050
You made a reservation under
"King of the Swing?"

223
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,890
-Yeah, of course, my horse.
-I'm sorry.

224
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,770
-He doesn't get out of his cage much.
-I can see that.

225
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,050
Here are your keys.

226
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,050
You leave your passports
at the desk.

227
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,690
That was taken when I was like 1 3.
I was kind of husky.

228
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,170
Not anymore, though, you know?

229
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,170
Do you have any private rooms?
We're probably gonna need them.

230
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,330
The rooms are semiprivate,
so you will have roommates.

231
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,290
Roommates, huh? That's gay.

232
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,330
Sorry.

233
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,730
-Oh, my God.
-It's okay.

234
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,730
The room is yours.
We are going to the spa.

235
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,850
You should come.

236
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,250
Spa.

237
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,330
Jugs.

238
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,130
-Hey.
-Hello.

239
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,210
Oh, Jesus.

240
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,130
-Hi. Hey.
-Hi.

241
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,970
How you doing?

242
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,530
I'm so happy I shaved my balls.

243
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,610
What? I have the smoothest balls
in Iceland.

244
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,690
-You wanna see?
-No, no, no, you're not... I'm good.

245
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,050
Put your anteater away,
it's totally creepy.

246
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:41,290
-You're not from Iceland, no?
-No. Fuck, no. American.

247
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,010
Yeah, unlike him,
I had my foreskin removed at birth.

248
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,690
Hygiene and... Am I talking?

249
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,530
-I'm Josh.
-Natalya.

250
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,850
-And this is Svetlana.
-Hi.

251
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,090
Hi, I'm Paxton.

252
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,130
-And this is Oli.
-The King of the Swing.

253
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,810
Hello.

254
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,170
Face on the ass. Never gets old.

255
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,730
Jesus.

256
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,730
So where are you girls from?

257
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,090
I'm from Italy,
but my parents are Russian.

258
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,210
Prague.

259
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,010
Prague's cool. Kafka.

260
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,530
So, Natalya....

261
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,210
-Yeah?
-You're Russian, eh?

262
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,370
Oh, my God.
Look, there are too many girls.

263
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,130
-This is awesome.
-Yes.

264
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,010
I mean, I was a senior,
you know, she was a junior...

265
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,490
...and then I graduated,
and it was weird, you know.

266
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,850
I mean, I'm totally over it.
It's... You know, it's cool.

267
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,370
It's okay.

268
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:42,970
Look, Vala is here.

269
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,490
-Who?
-Vala, from front desk. Vala.

270
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,410
-All right, Oli.
-Hey, I told you, man.

271
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:52,610
I'm the King of the Swing.

272
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,970
Come, let's dance.

273
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,250
-Does the cigarette bother you?
-No, it's...

274
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,130
I put away.

275
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,450
It's fine, I....

276
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,410
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

277
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,450
But I'll be back, okay?

278
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,010
Cigarette.

279
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,450
Cigarette.

280
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,130
Aren't you a little young?

281
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,010
-Dollar.
-What?

282
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,850
Dollar.

283
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,130
-Dollar.
-Here you go.

284
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,490
Here, children commit
the most crime.

285
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,890
They don't care.
They will attack anyone.

286
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,970
-You're okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

287
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,250
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

288
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,890
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

289
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,290
Hey, Josh.

290
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,850
Faggot.

291
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,530
Go with your friends. It's okay.

292
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,450
I wanted to say sorry about earlier.

293
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,570
About the way I reacted.

294
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,650
We cool?

295
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,370
I would have done
the same thing at your age.

296
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,450
It's not easy...

297
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,170
...but from my experience...

298
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,530
...choosing to have a family
was the right choice for me.

299
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,090
Now I have my little girl...

300
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,850
...who means more to me
than anything in the world.

301
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,530
But you should do...

302
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,970
...whatever's right for you.

303
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,010
Excuse me, it's my turn now.

304
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,850
Should we be doing this
with them there?

305
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,770
Yeah, it's okay.

306
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,250
-Yeah, baby. Josh, give it to me, baby.
-Okay, all right. Okay, stop!

307
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,810
-All right.
-Come on, big boy.

308
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,250
-We go to spa.
-Spa.

309
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,970
Spa, spa, spa.
Being dirty while getting clean.

310
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,650
Bye.

311
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,530
Mission accomplished.

312
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,370
You know that Amsterdam kid
with the thing on his lip?

313
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,130
I'm gonna send him
a really nice thank-you note.

314
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,330
Be quiet.

315
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,210
They're showering together.

316
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,250
Shit, man. We're never leaving here.

317
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,890
I guess Oli's not back yet.

318
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,690
No, dude, he probably
took that desk girl home.

319
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,330
We'll see him at breakfast.

320
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,610
-What's the name?
-Oli Ericson, 23 7.

321
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,930
How are we supposed to
understand this without subtitles?

322
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,170
Fucking gay.

323
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,250
Yeah, he checked out this morning.

324
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,730
You mean he took his
passport to go out?

325
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,170
No, it say he checked out
this morning.

326
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,210
-When this morning?
-I don't know exact time.

327
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,450
I could find out tomorrow.

328
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,290
Hey, Oli, it's Pax.
Are you still with that chick?

329
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,290
Can I leave a note
in case he comes back?

330
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,410
Okay, cool. Yeah.

331
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,010
All right.

332
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,250
He's probably still with Vala.
When she call me, I call you, okay?

333
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,130
Okay.

334
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,810
-We see you later, right?
-Yeah.

335
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,970
Okay.

336
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,170
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

337
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,810
Oli, hey, it's me again.
We're gonna go into town, so call us.

338
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,570
You're gay.
Damn voice mail again.

339
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,810
-Hi! Hi! Hi!
-Hi.

340
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,610
Your friend.

341
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,770
-What the hell?
-Your friend, my friend.

342
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,730
What does that say?

343
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,330
<i>Sayonara. Your friend.</i>

344
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,050
What, they left? Like, together?

345
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,010
That doesn't make any sense.
Oli doesn't even like Asian girls.

346
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,690
I mean, no offense, but...

347
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,290
When did she send this to you?

348
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,530
This picture. Today?

349
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,850
Could you do me a favor
and send this picture to my phone?

350
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,970
This picture.

351
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,570
That water looks fucking cold.

352
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,130
You know, if you fell in,
you'd die in 90 seconds.

353
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,650
Dude, did I tell you I saw
a girl drown when I was 8?

354
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,490
-Where?
-Lake Michigan.

355
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,410
It was fucked up, man.
This little girl, probably 4 or 5.

356
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,050
We made eye contact,
which was a weird thing, you know...

357
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,730
...and she was yelling for me
to help her.

358
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,210
Yeah? What did you do?

359
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,050
I ran to the lifeguard, who was busy
talking to her boyfriend at the time...

360
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,650
...and I yelled, you know,
"There's this girl drowning. "

361
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,570
And she couldn't see her.
Probably thought I was making it up.

362
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,610
And then a second later all you could
hear was this horrible screaming.

363
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,250
It was that little girl's mother, dude.

364
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,290
Her kid was dead.

365
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,370
-Jesus.
-I had nightmares for years after that.

366
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:07,130
I mean, I'd wake up every fucking
night hearing that mother scream.

367
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,810
I just....

368
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,690
I just felt like I could have
done more.

369
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,370
You did the right thing.
Could've been a double drowning.

370
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,650
Yeah, well, I didn't see it
that way at the time.

371
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,330
All I knew was this little girl was dead
and her mother's life was ruined.

372
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,570
What makes you think of this now?

373
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,570
Bubble gum.

374
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,370
-Sorry, kid.
-No, no. Give him some.

375
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,650
What are you doing?

376
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,170
These fucking kids are dangerous.

377
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,290
Hey, Oli.

378
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,570
-Hey, Oli.
-Hey.

379
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,930
-Hey.
-Hey.

380
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,250
-Hey, Oli. Hey!
-Oli!

381
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,770
It's your lucky day, Josh.

382
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,490
A museum.

383
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,690
How's it hanging?

384
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,410
-What the fuck?
-Holy shit.

385
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:51,450
-He got you.
-Yeah, that's hilarious.

386
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,770
Okay.

387
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,970
Hey, Oli.

388
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,210
Hey, Oli.

389
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,650
Hey, hey.

390
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,690
Excuse me?

391
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,490
I'm sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

392
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,170
Well, I'm not.

393
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,850
Where did you get that jacket?

394
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,570
-Hey, I'm talking to you, man.
-Get your fucking hands off me.

395
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,690
This is my jacket.

396
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,730
It's from Oli.

397
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,090
"I go home"?

398
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,890
I don't know,
maybe his battery died.

399
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,410
Hey, Kana, when are you leaving?

400
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,810
I'm sorry. When are you going away?

401
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,410
Tomorrow, I go.

402
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,890
Okay, because we may go too.

403
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:54,690
Do you wanna go to the train with us?
To the train station?

404
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,250
Tomorrow, train?

405
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,010
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,490
-Hello, Josh.
-Hey.

407
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,490
-Hey.
-Come, we go for disco?

408
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,210
Actually, I just wanna find my friend
and get the fuck out of here.

409
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,130
Okay, we'll see you.

410
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,210
Hey, guys, hold up a sec.
We'll be right out.

411
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,930
Okay.

412
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,690
-Josh, come here, dude.
-Yeah, what?

413
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,290
It's not their fault Oli disappeared,
so stop acting like it is.

414
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,490
-I'm annoyed he'd ditch us.
-I'm pissed too.

415
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,090
But we're not in America.

416
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,090
I mean, people meet each other
and split without saying shit.

417
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,090
It's just how they do it over here.

418
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,050
As well as we may think we know Oli,
we don't really know him.

419
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,010
He could've gone
somewhere with that girl.

420
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,090
Fuck, maybe he's in Iceland.
The guy's got a daughter.

421
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,530
So let's look at our options.

422
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,810
We can A, fuck these girls one more
night and then head to Barcelona...

423
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,170
...or B, not fuck them,
then head to Barcelona anyway.

424
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,010
Think about it. When I'm studying for
the bar and you're writing your thesis...

425
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,170
...this is the shit
we're gonna think about.

426
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,290
Okay. All right, he doesn't show up,
it's his problem.

427
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,690
-It's his problem.
-All right.

428
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,890
All right.

429
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,210
Hey, Kana, you wanna go
to the disco with us?

430
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,050
You know, disco?
Dancing?

431
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,490
No?

432
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,730
Josh?

433
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,570
-I'm gonna go back.
-Are you okay?

434
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,010
I'm, like... I'm tired.

435
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,610
Actually, I have, like, a headache.

436
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,450
If you want, I will go with you.

437
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:15,930
No, no, no, I'll just see you
back at the room.

438
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,930
Goodbye.

439
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,810
<i>Fucking pussy.</i>

440
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,450
-Josh.
-Vala.

441
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,370
You don't look well.

442
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,690
-No, I...
-Here, let me help you.

443
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,770
I feel sick.

444
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:18,610
Where is...?
Where is Oli?

445
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,730
You need rest.

446
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,210
Where's the restroom?

447
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,170
Past the bar, in the back.

448
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,890
You guys cool?

449
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,850
<i>-Vodka Red Bull.
-Vodka Red Bull, danke.</i>

450
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,970
Yeah.

451
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,970
Hey!

452
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,770
Hey!

453
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,650
Open the door.

454
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,370
Oh, fuck.

455
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,210
What the f...?

456
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,450
Oh, fuck.

457
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,770
What...? Who are you?

458
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,850
What the f...? Where the fuck am I?

459
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,370
What the fuck is this shit?

460
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,290
Please, please...
Fuck. Please, please, please...

461
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,610
I didn't fucking do shit to you,
what the fuck!

462
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,450
Please, please, what the...?

463
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:37,930
Please, no, sir.
Please fucking stop. Please!

464
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,170
What the fuck?

465
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,890
Please, I didn't fucking do anything.

466
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,450
What the fuck?

467
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:48,490
What the fuck?
This is such fucking bullshit.

468
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:50,090
What the fuck is this?

469
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,010
What? No! No, please don't...!

470
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,210
What the...?
No, no, fucking don't you... No, no!

471
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,970
Oh, my God, no, no!
Oh, my fucking God!

472
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,010
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no!

473
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,330
Oh, please. What the fuck?

474
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,810
No, no, no, no, fuck! No!

475
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,250
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

476
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,650
You.

477
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,650
Why?

478
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:01,410
I always wanted to be a surgeon...

479
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,650
...but the boards wouldn't pass me.

480
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,010
Can you guess why?

481
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,770
You see?

482
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,490
So I went into business...

483
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,210
...but business is so boring.

484
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,770
You buy things, you sell them.
You make money, you spend money.

485
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,610
What kind of life is that?

486
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,450
A surgeon...

487
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:38,210
...he holds the very essence
of life in his hands.

488
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,010
Your life.

489
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,570
He touches it.

490
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,370
He has a relationship with it.

491
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,130
He's part of it.

492
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,330
Please, please.
Just let me go, please.

493
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,930
You want to go?

494
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,810
Is that what you want?

495
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,450
Oh, my God!

496
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,610
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

497
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,810
You are free to go.

498
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,930
Oh, fuck. No!

499
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,010
No. No, fuck. No, fuck...

500
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:14,570
Please, I have money.
I'll fucking pay you.

501
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,530
Ten times, two times,
whatever you want...

502
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,050
-Pay me?
-Yes.

503
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,610
No one is paying me.

504
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,210
In fact, I am the one paying them.

505
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:36,090
Relax. Relax, bro.

506
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,930
Oh, shit.

507
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,450
-Two thirty-seven, please.
-Two three seven.

508
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,210
Didn't you check out?

509
00:43:58,450 --> 00:43:59,650
No, not yet.

510
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,490
Not yet.

511
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,210
-This your bag?
-Yeah.

512
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,850
The maid brought it here.
You're checked out.

513
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,690
-I didn't check out.
-It says.

514
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,450
It happened this morning.

515
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,650
This is bullshit.
Did somebody leave a note?

516
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,770
Because I didn't
fucking check out, dude.

517
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:19,370
No, man, just this bag.
If it's a mistake...

518
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:22,010
Yeah, it's definitely a mistake.
We need a fucking room.

519
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,410
Chill out, man. You're on vacation.

520
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,450
Two three seven.

521
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,970
Hey, was there a Japanese girl
waiting in the lobby for somebody?

522
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,130
No, think they left this morning.

523
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:39,730
Yeah.

524
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,130
I'm sorry, dude.

525
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,850
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

526
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,730
It's okay. We are going to the spa.

527
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:59,810
You will join us?

528
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:06,330
You should come.

529
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,650
Hey, Josh, call me
soon as you get this, man.

530
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,930
I got locked in that club.
It was retarded, dude.

531
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,690
I'm at the hostel.

532
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,010
Svetlana!

533
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,690
Svetlana!

534
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,290
Hey!

535
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,330
You little fucker.

536
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,130
Jesus.

537
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,970
Wait at hostel for your friends.

538
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,490
They will look for you there
no matter what.

539
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:30,770
Yeah, I know. But, see, my friend
Josh is the kind of guy who...

540
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:34,570
He just wouldn't check out without
so much as leaving a note, you know.

541
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,250
He's the responsible one.

542
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,250
Yeah, but maybe he worried
his belongings get stolen...

543
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,370
...so he take them when he go out.

544
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,970
Someone misplace if he leaves note.

545
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,970
It is not uncommon.

546
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,090
Yeah, well, is there
anything else that I can do?

547
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:55,890
There's nothing right now.

548
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:57,450
We have his picture...

549
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,730
...if we see him, or he is picked up,
or something happen...

550
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,530
...we contact you at hostel, yeah?

551
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,090
Okay.

552
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,450
Where are you from?

553
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:10,530
California.

554
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,930
You are so far from home.

555
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:37,890
Paxton. Come, have a drink.

556
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,570
Hello, Mr. American.

557
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:48,010
-Did you get my messages?
-Which one?

558
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,650
There are so many.

559
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,410
I call you back, but child answer.

560
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,250
Yeah, I know.

561
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:55,930
Have you seen Josh?

562
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,330
In English, please.

563
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,090
He is with your friend...

564
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,010
...the King of the Swing.

565
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,490
-He's with Oli.
-Why you leave last night?

566
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:14,730
Did you not listen to my messages?
I got locked in a storage room.

567
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:18,090
I don't know,
I got sick and passed out.

568
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:24,130
-What?
-She said you met another girl.

569
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,090
Where are my friends?

570
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:33,810
The art show.

571
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,410
-You mean like a museum?
-No, no, no.

572
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:43,650
Not museum.
They went... How you say, for artist?

573
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,690
-Exhibit.
-Exhibit for artist.

574
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,290
No, that doesn't make any sense.

575
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,050
Why? What is wrong?

576
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,210
Well, they didn't leave a note.
They didn't call or do anything.

577
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,770
They tell us to tell you.

578
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,810
Yeah, but I tried calling them all day.

579
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:59,930
Yes, but their phone, the battery die
and they do not have...

580
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,050
How you say, for electricity?

581
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:05,090
Converter. Okay, whatever,
where is this art show...

582
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,810
...because I wanna go.

583
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,730
-Have a drink.
-I don't want a drink.

584
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,970
All right? I wanna see some art.

585
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,690
Okay? So can we go?

586
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,130
You're not going?

587
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:29,810
I've seen this show.

588
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,850
You want gum?

589
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:39,850
No.

590
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,650
Too bad for you.

591
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,050
We are here.

592
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,450
Are you coming or what?

593
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,250
Excuse me. Excuse me.

594
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:14,850
How is it in there?

595
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:17,730
Be careful.

596
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:20,770
Why is that?

597
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:25,490
You could spend all your money...

598
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,490
...in there.

599
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:02,490
How much is it?

600
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:04,650
For you, free.

601
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,690
There.

602
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,730
That's the show?

603
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:29,370
Yes.

604
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,730
-What?
-Nothing.

605
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,570
You're so serious,
Mr. Serious American.

606
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,690
You fucking whore.

607
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:57,730
You fucking bitch.

608
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,970
You fucking bitch!

609
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,050
I get a lot of money for you...

610
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:07,130
...and that make you my bitch.

611
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:12,770
Fuck. Get the fuck off me!

612
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,290
This is fucked!

613
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:17,650
Get the fuck off me!

614
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,250
Get the fuck off me!

615
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:18,090
Fuck.

616
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:47,650
Talk.

617
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,410
Talk. Speak.

618
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:55,450
What the fuck
do you want me to say?

619
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,930
American.

620
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:02,650
No. No, wait!

621
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:05,090
I'm not fucking American!

622
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:08,970
I'm not fucking... Look at me.
I'm not fucking American.

623
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:11,290
American.

624
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:16,610
Please, what the fuck is this?

625
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:24,930
Let me go. Please.

626
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:28,650
I promise I won't tell anybody.

627
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:32,210
Just please let me go.

628
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,290
Don't. Don't.

629
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:01,090
Please don't.

630
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:12,850
Don't, please.

631
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,210
God.

632
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,010
Oh, please, stop!

633
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:52,850
Please stop it. Please stop it.

634
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:56,450
I know you don't wanna do this.

635
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,050
Please don't do this.

636
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:05,890
Fuck.

637
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:12,610
Oh, shit.

638
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:15,810
What the fuck?

639
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:18,130
What do you think?

640
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,450
How do I look?

641
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:24,570
I feel like a butcher or a surgeon
or some shit, know what I mean?

642
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:28,410
I feel fucking ridiculous in this thing,
but I guess you need it, huh?

643
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:33,810
Yeah. I'll tell you something....

644
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:37,770
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Wait a sec.

645
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,770
How was it?

646
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:46,370
Good.

647
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:49,730
Well, goddamn, motherfucker,
for this money, it better be. Shit.

648
01:10:49,890 --> 01:10:52,090
What did you go for, a local?

649
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:53,410
What, European?

650
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:56,890
-American.
-An Amer...?

651
01:10:57,570 --> 01:11:00,450
Ain't that a bitch. Big spender.
I fucking... I love it.

652
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:03,330
I just fucking love that shit.
You know what they got for me?

653
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:05,410
They told me they lined up
something special.

654
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:07,610
I've been waiting almost a week
for this shit.

655
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:09,450
For 50 grand,
she better be worth it.

656
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:11,770
But it's supposed to be
a real rush, right?

657
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:16,410
It's like... They told me
it's like a real fucking rush, right?

658
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:18,010
Come here.

659
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,690
I've been all over the world.
You know, I've been everywhere.

660
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:24,570
And the bottom line is,
pussy's pussy.

661
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,650
You know, every strip club,
every whorehouse, every....

662
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:30,410
It's all the same shit.

663
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:34,450
I just fucked a girl two days ago, I don't
even remember the color of her tits.

664
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:40,090
But this, this is something
you never forget, right?

665
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:42,770
Right?

666
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:46,250
-Never.
-Never, right.

667
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,770
Let me show you something.
Pretty sweet. Check this out.

668
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,770
What do you think of this?
Come on, let me see yours.

669
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:56,810
Come on, let me see yours.
We're all in the same club.

670
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:59,050
I'll be out in a second, guy.

671
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:03,250
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you mind?

672
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,730
How'd you do it?

673
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:08,490
Did you do it real slow...

674
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:11,610
...or did you just get it over with
right away?

675
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:13,450
That's why I asked for
the fucking gun.

676
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:15,610
Because I just wanted
to fucking do it quick.

677
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:17,330
I just wanted to get it over with.

678
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:19,970
But now I'm thinking maybe
I wanna feel it, you know?

679
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:21,690
I wanna fucking feel that shit.

680
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:25,090
So I don't know what to... I'm thinking...
What do you think I should do?

681
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,010
-Make it quick.
-Make it quick.

682
01:12:30,170 --> 01:12:32,050
Yes.

683
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:34,530
Yeah, that's... No, fuck that shit.

684
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:37,850
Fuck this, too fucking American, dude.
I'm going fucking old school.

685
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:39,650
Who wants this, motherfucker?

686
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:42,370
Who wants this shit?
Come on, motherfucker.

687
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,170
Bring it.

688
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:10,130
Hey, buddy.

689
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:12,890
Get your own fucking room.
I paid for this.

690
01:14:15,650 --> 01:14:16,930
What are you, fucking deaf?

691
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:26,690
Kana.

692
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,890
-Oh, my God.
-What do you want me to do, Kana?

693
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:43,810
What? I don't understand
what you're saying. What?

694
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:55,690
Fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hold still. Hold still.

695
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:59,970
-Fuck. Oh, God. God.
-No. No!

696
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:02,050
-Shit.
-No!

697
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:05,450
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

698
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:23,450
Fuck!

699
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:24,970
Fuck!

700
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:30,250
Fuck!

701
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:45,690
We're gonna get the fuck
out of here, Kana.

702
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:11,210
Move this fucking truck!

703
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,410
Fuck.

704
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,090
We're almost there.

705
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:30,450
Oh, my God.

706
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:34,930
Oh, no.

707
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:40,450
Fuck.

708
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:11,370
Kana.

709
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,530
Kana.

710
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:25,610
Come here.

711
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:37,050
No. No, Kana. Kana.

712
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:42,650
No, Kana.

713
01:22:35,530 --> 01:22:39,490
No, thank you.
I prefer to use my hands.

714
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:43,170
I believe people have lost
their relationship with food.

715
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,330
They do not think:

716
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:47,650
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry. "

717
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:52,210
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

718
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:35,090
Oh, Jesus.

719
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:47,530
Goddamn!

720
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:49,570
Fucker.

721
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:20,330
No, please!

722
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:07,690
I get a lot of money for you...

723
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:10,850
...and that make you my bitch.
