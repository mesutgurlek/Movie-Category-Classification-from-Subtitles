818
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:37,415
Ryder, I need you to stand up
and put your hands
behind your back.

819
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,860
I need you to stand up,
put your hands
behind your back.

820
01:06:57,779 --> 01:06:59,041
(CLEARS THROAT)

821
01:07:01,483 --> 01:07:03,144
So, where are you from?

822
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:05,515
All over.

823
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:09,020
Is that so?

824
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,655
You're a sick fuck,
aren't ya?

825
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:17,054
The way you tortured
that young man.

826
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:19,490
I know
you enjoyed yourself.

827
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:23,264
I just can't figure out
why you did it.

828
01:07:23,405 --> 01:07:25,100
You knew
you'd get caught.

829
01:07:25,173 --> 01:07:26,765
Why'd you do it?

830
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:29,772
Why not?

831
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:35,481
How many others
have you killed?

832
01:07:40,155 --> 01:07:41,554
Hard to say.

833
01:07:45,794 --> 01:07:48,024
You see,
here in the great state
of New Mexico,

834
01:07:48,163 --> 01:07:50,393
we do have
the death penalty.

835
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,961
You don't seem
too worried.

836
01:07:58,073 --> 01:07:59,472
Should I be?

837
01:08:04,546 --> 01:08:06,946
You comfy down there, John?

838
01:08:07,382 --> 01:08:09,509
Are those cuffs
a little tight?

839
01:08:10,285 --> 01:08:11,912
Yeah, a little tight.

840
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:14,717
Yeah, you see,
those are the new ones.

841
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:20,926
They stretch out after
you wear them for a while.
Let me see.

(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

843
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:26,190
Look at me.

844
01:08:29,938 --> 01:08:32,133
You have yourself
a nice trip.

845
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:35,435
We'll chat again real soon.

846
01:08:36,511 --> 01:08:39,309
Maybe next time,
you'll be better company.

847
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:14,571
Thanks.

848
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:19,749
Where are we going?

849
01:09:20,155 --> 01:09:23,318
I'm taking you to Albuquerque
for trauma support.

850
01:09:23,525 --> 01:09:25,925
I can release you
to your parents there.

851
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:53,986
OFFICER: Step up.

852
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:45,099
03 X-ray,
we're about 20 minutes out.

<i>DISPATCHER:
Copy that, 03 X-ray.</i>

854
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:51,406
OFFICER: I get home,
I look at my paycheck.

855
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,469
It's so skinny.

856
01:10:53,248 --> 01:10:54,738
I decide to take
another job.

857
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,407
So now
I'm delivering pizza.

858
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:06,419
What are you
getting your daughter
for her birthday?

859
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,655
She's just turned five.

860
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,254
She wants to take me...
Go to the mall,

861
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,266
get one of those big
customized teddy bears.

862
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:13,858
A customized teddy bear?
Come on.

863
01:11:13,935 --> 01:11:15,266
Yeah.

864
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:18,135
It's just another way
they can charge...

865
01:11:39,594 --> 01:11:41,255
ESTERIDGE: Look, Grace...

866
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:44,124
I wish I could have
stopped this

867
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:47,066
before it got
all out of control.

868
01:11:49,004 --> 01:11:52,838
I know there's
nothing that I can say
that'll bring Jim back,

869
01:11:54,876 --> 01:11:56,434
but I am sorry.

870
01:11:57,612 --> 01:11:59,045
I truly am.

871
01:12:01,983 --> 01:12:04,315
Get your own little pants,
your own little jacket.

872
01:12:04,386 --> 01:12:06,411
Make your own
little teddy bear.

873
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,670
For real, you spent
100 bucks on a teddy bear?

874
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,230
Yeah, I know.
It was hurting me.

875
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:28,865
Yeah, it's 100 bucks...

876

You know,
this week's check,
it's gone.

Stop moving.

01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:58,230
What the fuck?

to run up over that hill
and wait there for help.

I'm done running.

That's not the answer.

You don't know
what you're doing.
