to be talking to Sam.

You said no boys, not no phones.

201
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:53,323
I did say no phones.

202
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:56,242
But you didn't say it would
be physically impossible

Who? Mrs. Gregorson?

222
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:38,660
I see, like, two houses here.

If I'm getting anything out of being
stuck in the middle of nowhere,

it's a tan without lines.

she left the bottoms on.

Where'd you learn that? Wikipedia?

243

I learned it from livin' in Indiana,

which means that you
should know it too.

while we're walkin' around.

Kinda looks like it.

their territory or somethin'.

00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:32,829
I don't like them there
tattoos and shit.

00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:34,580
MARY: Shut up, he could hear you.

All right, I got popcorn.

328
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,642
Sing a song...

329
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:53,516
Is it popcorn or is it popped-corn?

330
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:55,768
I don't know. Jenn, go long!

331
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,937
Zoe, you're wasting it all.

332
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,981
JENN: Okay, whose turn is it?

333
00:19:00,081 --> 00:19:03,568
ZOE: All right, Jenn.
Would you rather? Go.

334
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:07,113
Okay. Would you rather

335
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,532
never be able to use a tampon

336
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,534
or never be able to use lipstick?

337
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:13,286
That is so lame, Jenn.

338
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,662
I've got one.

339
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,706
Are you ready?

340
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:20,668
Would you rather watch your mom
get murdered by your daddy

341
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:25,298
or get raped by your daddy
while your mom had to watch?

342
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,133
Zoe, that's awful.

343
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,593
Would you rather?

344
00:19:28,693 --> 00:19:30,394
Answer it.

345
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,105
I guess

346
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:34,891
get raped by my dad.

347
00:19:34,991 --> 00:19:36,392
- Ew!
- Gross!

348
00:19:36,492 --> 00:19:37,935
What? Would you rather
have your mom die?

349
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:39,228
I wouldn't do either.

350
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:40,730
That's so fucking disgusting.

351
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,690
You're sick.

352
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,400
What's the point of
this game anyways?

353
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,694
I don't blame you,
your dad's real hot.

Y'all can make out
like you did last time.

No, that's no fun unless there's
guys around to make jealous.

That's bullshit.

You liked it and you know it.

Come here, come give me a kiss.

Why are there no streetlights?

390

I'm sorry, babe.
Buck talked me into it.

Yeah, I had to drag his
ass all the way up here

No, no, there was

It was fucking rabid or something.

Well, you know what we should do?

537

We should capture it and
we'll raise it as our own.

Beavers carry it.

979

Affects people too.

980
00:49:58,896 --> 00:50:00,381
Affects them how?

981
00:50:00,481 --> 00:50:03,980
Oh, diarrhea mostly.

982

with what's going on here?

Any of you guys got diarrhea?

- No.
- Well, now that's good.

Doesn't matter anyway.

been real dead.

- "Beavers are herbivores."
- Great book.

"They live in family
groups or colonies

1060

that they're, that we're other beavers?

it was just,

1069
00:55:17,464 --> 00:55:19,791
it was just one of those things.

1070
00:55:20,426 --> 00:55:22,469
So you're saying it was a mistake?

1071

Don't answer.

Look...

1074
00:55:28,475 --> 00:55:32,429
Once the three of us are
far away from this cabin,

1075
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:33,797
we can sit down like adults

1076
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:37,191
and we can try to figure out why
you both find me attractive.

1077
00:55:42,656 --> 00:55:45,142
Jenn, you have every
reason to hate me.

1078
00:55:45,242 --> 00:55:46,943
Why him?

1079
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:51,315
I don't know.

1080
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:53,116
Listen,

1081
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:56,411
we cannot turn against
each other right now.

1082
00:55:56,754 --> 00:55:59,377
That is exactly what the
beavers would want.

1083
00:56:00,841 --> 00:56:02,758
Let me see this.

1084
00:56:06,847 --> 00:56:10,668
"Animal behaviorists have found beavers
to be gentle, reasoning creatures

"They are considered to be
excellent at building tunnels."

the premises for the time being.

00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:49,051
What about the old lady?

1092

Well, she's still in bed
what's left of her, anyway.

00:56:56,271 --> 00:56:57,972
Sandwich?

1095
00:56:58,857 --> 00:57:00,634
No, it's Buck's foot.

1096
00:57:00,734 --> 00:57:03,607
We're keeping it on ice
so we could reattach it.

1097
00:57:04,238 --> 00:57:06,473
That's what we're supposed
to do, right? Keep it on ice?

1098
00:57:06,573 --> 00:57:08,976
Well, not directly on ice.
It kills the tissue.

1099
00:57:09,076 --> 00:57:11,687
Well, shit! Well, what shall I do?
Shall I wrap it in a towel or something?

1100
00:57:11,787 --> 00:57:14,364
Well, I suppose that depends
on when it came off.

1101
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,834
I... I don't know. This afternoon,
maybe four or five hours ago.

1102
00:57:18,794 --> 00:57:22,794
Technically, I guess there's a chance
that they can sew that sucker back on.

1103
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:25,617
We'd have to be at the hospital within
the hour but that ain't gonna happen.

1104
00:57:25,717 --> 00:57:29,011
Might as well just chuck the
damn thing and call it a day.

1105
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:31,874
I'm sorry. Do you want some chicken?

1106
00:57:31,974 --> 00:57:33,917
There's plenty of it in
the fridge over there.

1107
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,378
I don't want any chicken.
We need to go to the hospital now.

1108
00:57:36,478 --> 00:57:39,173
Well, you know as well as I do

1109
00:57:39,273 --> 00:57:42,342
that road's blocked. We sure as
hell can't get through on foot

1110
00:57:42,442 --> 00:57:44,143

1111
00:57:44,778 --> 00:57:47,105
With or without
carrying the big fella.

1112
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:53,737
Plus, beavers are generally
more active at night.

1113
00:57:54,538 --> 00:57:58,538
So I suggest maybe we hole
up here till the morning,

1114
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,488
then one or two of us
can make a go at it.

1115

He could bleed to death overnight.

Yeah, well. I could always
cauterize the stump.

Sam cheated, did you?
