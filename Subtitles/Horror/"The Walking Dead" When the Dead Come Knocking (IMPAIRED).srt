Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...

00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:10,344
Is my brother alive?

4
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:11,588
Yeah.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,253
- Hold up!
- Let go of her.

6
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:19,966
Now we're gonna
go for a little drive.

7
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:23,065
From the looks of 'em, they
got to be set up pretty good.

8
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,483
I'll find out where.

10
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:44,563
Merle: You don't even know
why you're here, do you?

11
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:49,067
I didn't mean you no harm.

12
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:51,370
I lowered my gun,

13
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:54,306
but you raised yours.

14
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,711
You were an asshole out there,

15
00:00:59,712 --> 00:01:02,246
just like you were on that
rooftop back there in Atlanta.

16
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:07,018
What y'all did,
leaving me up there--

17
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,921
people wouldn't
do that to an animal.

18
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:11,423
We went back for you.

19
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,957
Ain't you thoughtful?

20
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:16,059
We did, all of us--

21
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,194
Rick, Daryl, T-Dog.

22
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:21,932
Mm, T-Dog.

23
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,401
Yeah, big ol'
spear-chucker,

24
00:01:24,402 --> 00:01:26,870
the one I was pleading with.

25
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:29,339
Mm-hmm, the one
that dropped the key.

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,740
Tell me where he's at.

27
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,275
I'm sure T-Dog would like
to bury the hatchet,

28

29
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:38,815
He didn't make it.

30
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:43,920
Well, I hope he went slow.

31
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,921
Yeah.

32
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,893
How about the rest?

33
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:54,062
Hmm?

34
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:56,765
How about my baby brother?

35
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,600
You can't tell me he's alive

36
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:01,369
and then hold off
on where he is.

37
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:04,939
No?

38
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,409
Well, maybe the farmer's
daughter will help me out.

Friendly abandoned people,

left you behind by now.

177

But he didn't do that, did he?

178
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,394
<i>Hmm. So tell me,</i>
<i>where y'all been at?</i>

Hey, don't you worry
about your old man.

208
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:11,805
I'm gonna keep my eye on him.

209

- Wasn't this place overrun?
- It was.

210
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:23,916
And you cleared it out
all by yourselves?

211
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:25,750
Just the few of you?

212
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,319
There were others.

213
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:31,857
Carl.

214
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:49,840

- I had to.

I know, and I'm sorry.

No one should have
to go through that.

218
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:08,324
How long will you be gone?

219
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:13,162
Look, if something happens

Daryl's been calling her
Ass-Kicker.

Ass-Kicker?

228

<i>Has he, now?</i>

229
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:48,428
I've been thinking, what
should we really call her?

230
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:52,132
What do you think?

231

Remember my third grade
teacher, Mrs. Mueller?

232

Of course.

233
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,209
Her first name was Judith.

234
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,077
Do you think
that's a good name?

235
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:08,447
I think that's--
that's a fine name.

00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,409
They did it.

493
00:40:14,594 --> 00:40:18,163
Your brother might be out there
right now, searching for them.

494
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:20,733
Blood is blood, right?

495
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:25,102
Makes me wonder
where your loyalties lie.

496
00:40:36,248 --> 00:40:37,748
Here.

497
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:42,552
You two get a small group
and scout this prison.

498
00:40:42,553 --> 00:40:44,520
I want to know exactly
what we're dealing with.

499
00:40:44,521 --> 00:40:46,022
Yeah.
You got it.

500
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:39,740
<i>You kept your word.</i>

501
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:42,309
That you'd be back.

502
00:41:48,482 --> 00:41:50,650
Everything go all
right with Milton?

503
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,061
What happened?

504
00:42:03,996 --> 00:42:05,964
Mr. Coleman died.

505
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,969
And did Milton find
what he was looking for?

506
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:17,141
No.

507
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:25,783
Hey, hey.
Shh.

508
00:42:25,784 --> 00:42:29,620
It's all right.
It's all right.

509
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,724
It's over now, huh?

510
00:42:34,826 --> 00:42:36,326
It's all right.

511
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:45,936
