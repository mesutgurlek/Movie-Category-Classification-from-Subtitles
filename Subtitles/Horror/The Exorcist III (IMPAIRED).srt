He was left to dress the body
and seal up the coffin.

And then, no one

It was a sad case.

1185

He always griped about The Order
not treating him well.

Well, he has family in Kentucky.

1187

- Toward the end?

Oh, he was elderly, 80, 81.

1192
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:09,720
He always said
that when he died,

1193
01:13:09,928 --> 01:13:12,556
he'd make sure he died at home.

1194
01:13:13,682 --> 01:13:14,975
We always figured
he'd just split

1195
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:16,977
because he sensed
the end was coming.

1196
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:21,732
He'd already had a couple
pretty bad coronaries.

...had two heart attacks,
precisely?

1200

Yeah, two.

Yes, he was very tall.

in Damien's coffin,

and discovered, well...

1210
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:09,613
He was elderly,

as an instrument of my...

1303
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:55,073
...work.

1304
01:23:55,615 --> 01:23:58,785
But then, that's a perk,
a bonus, a little extra.

1305
01:23:58,994 --> 01:24:00,453
The main thing

1306
01:24:00,662 --> 01:24:04,708
is the torment
of your friend, Father Karras,

1307
01:24:04,916 --> 01:24:08,670
as he watches while I rip,
and cut,

1308
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:11,631
and mutilate the innocent,
his friends,

1309
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,550
again, and again,

1310
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:15,677
and on, and on!

1311
01:24:15,885 --> 01:24:18,471
He is inside with us!

1312
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:20,890
He will never get away!

1313
01:24:21,099 --> 01:24:23,768
His pain won't end!

1314
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:33,820
Oh, gracious me, was I raving?

1315
01:24:34,529 --> 01:24:37,115
Please forgive me.

1316
01:24:37,490 --> 01:24:39,409
I'm mad.

1317
01:24:40,869 --> 01:24:42,662
Where was I?

1318
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,166
Oh, yes, the master.

1319
01:24:46,374 --> 01:24:48,376
He was kind, see?

1320
01:24:48,585 --> 01:24:52,088
He brought me to our mutual
acquaintance, Father Karras.

1321
01:24:52,297 --> 01:24:54,132
Not too well at the time,
I'm afraid.

1322
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:57,844
He was passing on
in the dying mode, as we say.

1323
01:24:58,053 --> 01:25:04,601
So, as Karras was
about to slip out of his body,

1324
01:25:04,809 --> 01:25:07,896
why, the master
was slipping me in.

1325
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:08,980
Slickly done.

1326
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:10,732
I mean, he was dead.

1327
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,150
His time was up.

1328
01:25:12,358 --> 01:25:15,195
He wanted out, but I was in.

1329
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:19,407
A little traumatized, true.

1330
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:21,576
I mean, after all,
his brain was jelly,

1331
01:25:21,785 --> 01:25:24,954
lack of oxygen and all,
that sort of thing.

1332
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:28,041
It took a maximum effort

1333
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:32,087
that at last got me out
of that cheap little coffin.

1334
01:25:32,295 --> 01:25:34,798
Vow of poverty, disgusting.

1335
01:25:36,007 --> 01:25:37,842
Never mind.

1336
01:25:39,677 --> 01:25:42,305
Toward the end,
a little slapstick

1337
01:25:42,514 --> 01:25:43,890
and comic relief

1338
01:25:44,099 --> 01:25:47,519
when that old Brother Fain
saw me climbing from the coffin.

1339
01:25:47,727 --> 01:25:49,521
[ Laughing ]

1340
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:54,609
It's the smiles
that keep us going,

1341
01:25:54,818 --> 01:25:55,735
don't you think?

1342
01:25:55,944 --> 01:25:58,738
The little giggles
and bits of good cheer.

1343
01:25:59,405 --> 01:26:03,201
After that, it was all
blue Mondays for a while.

1344
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:06,579
So much damage
to Karras' brain cells.

1345
01:26:06,788 --> 01:26:08,748
So many lost.

1346
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:16,506
It took me 15 years
to bring them back.

1347
01:26:18,091 --> 01:26:20,927
Fifteen years.

1348
01:26:22,095 --> 01:26:24,681
So many years.

1349
01:26:25,807 --> 01:26:27,934
Who are you?

1350
01:26:28,143 --> 01:26:31,437
Just a traveling man.

1351
01:26:31,646 --> 01:26:33,481
One who moves.

1352
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:36,901
How can I believe
that you're the Gemini Killer?

1353
01:26:40,321 --> 01:26:45,326
Oh, you are issuing a clear
invitation to the dance.

1354
01:26:45,994 --> 01:26:46,786
What do you mean?

1355
01:26:46,995 --> 01:26:49,539
- We shall see.
- Please, explain that.

1356
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:52,000
We shall see.

1357
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:56,045
Incidentally, don't blame me
for Temple.

1358
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:57,213
That was suicide.

1359
01:26:57,422 --> 01:27:00,341
The man was a lunatic,
a weakling.

1360
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:03,261
Still, he helped me.

1361
01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:07,432
Are there services?
I'd like to attend.

1362
01:27:08,099 --> 01:27:10,768
- Temple helped you?
- Yes, of course!

1363
01:27:10,977 --> 01:27:13,313
He brought you to me.

1364
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:16,566
I told him that if he failed
to convince you to come to me

1365
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:22,530
that he would suffer
in unspeakable ways.

1366
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:28,119
Poor superstitious fool,
he believed me.

1367
01:27:28,328 --> 01:27:30,121
And you came.

1368
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:32,957
But he couldn't take
the pressure, it would seem.

1369
01:27:33,374 --> 01:27:34,417
What pressure?

1370
01:27:34,626 --> 01:27:38,838
The pressure of inimitable me.

1371
01:27:39,047 --> 01:27:42,383
Some other tasks
I said I had for him,

1372
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:47,055
things, little things.

1373
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:49,891
You know, I think perhaps
you really are the Gemini.

1374
01:27:50,099 --> 01:27:52,101
- Oh, good.
- But I can't be sure.

1375
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,687
- Not sure?
- No.

1376
01:27:55,313 --> 01:27:58,733
I don't think I'll ever
really be convinced

1377
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:02,195
until I know how you managed
to get out of this cell.

1378
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:04,113
Does someone help you?

1379
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:06,407
I see.

1380
01:28:07,283 --> 01:28:08,368
Who helps you?

1381
01:28:09,661 --> 01:28:10,954
Just friends.

1382
01:28:11,162 --> 01:28:13,331
Old friends.

1383
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:19,045
You know, lieutenant...

1384
01:28:21,422 --> 01:28:25,051
There are so many possibilities.

1385
01:28:25,718 --> 01:28:30,515
Maybe I really am your friend,
Father Karras.

1386
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,226
And after the fall,

1387
01:28:33,434 --> 01:28:36,145
I revived at a terribly
inconvenient moment

1388
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:39,023
and wandered through the streets
without knowing who I was,

1389
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:41,359
and still don't,
for that matter.

1390
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:42,735
Needless to say, of course,

1391
01:28:42,944 --> 01:28:45,989
I'm quite naturally
and hopelessly mad.

1392
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:48,741
But sometimes,

1393
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:52,370
I have dreams of a rose.

1394
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:57,709
And then, falling down
a long flight of steps.

1395
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:01,129
And other times,

1396
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:03,840
I dream I'm the Gemini Killer.

1397
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:08,636
And these dreams are very nice.

1398
01:29:09,095 --> 01:29:12,890
They feel so comfortable,
so right.

1399
01:29:14,309 --> 01:29:18,938
But I can't sort out the dreams
from the truth.

1400
01:29:19,147 --> 01:29:20,982
Am I Karras?

1401
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,651
There's so many
other possibilities.

1402
01:29:24,402 --> 01:29:27,071
Perhaps the Gemini
had an accomplice

1403
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,033
who is still at large
and very active.

1404
01:29:30,241 --> 01:29:33,328
Maybe I am that old accomplice.

1405
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:36,497
Perhaps I'm telepathic
or have psychic powers

1406
01:29:36,706 --> 01:29:39,542
that give me all my knowledge
of the Gemini killings.
