You sure it's the building?

You're Lucie, right?

26

That's what the sisters said.

become good friends with Lucie.

Does she ever
say anything about, uh--

about the people
that hurt her?

No.

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,164
What kind of things
does Lucie tell you about, Anna?

51
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,285
It's okay, child.
You can tell him.

52
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,007
She talks
about monsters a lot.

they're still out there.

you were gonna show me them.

call the police.

would not have believed us.

- I am.

- There's a girl.

Oh, my God.

They knew what their parents
were doing, Anna.

- They're guilty, too.
- No, no. No, they're not.

169
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,807
Anna, you have to believe me.

170
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,928
- You have to believe me. Please?
- No!

171
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,481
Anna, Anna!

172

Please, please.

00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,523
I'm sorry.

175
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,445
I can't help you anymore.
I'm sorry.

176

Anna, please?

177
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,721
Anna?

178
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,006

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,201
L-- I did it.

183
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,045
I did it. It's over.

184
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,448
(whispering )
I stopped them.

185
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,241
It's supposed to be over.

186
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,731
See?

187
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,326

It hurt me.

199
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,164
It's okay, it's okay.
I've got you, okay?

200
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,721
I'm not gonna let anything
hurt you anymore, okay?

Do not treat the stranger

and take him into your heart.

- ( Anna whispering ) What?

206
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,767
- Please don't ever leave me.
- I won't.

- I promise.

Thy kingdom come,

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,161
Give us today day our daily bread.

214

For thine is the kingdom

215

and the power and the glory

216
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,286
forever and ever.

217
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,044
Amen.

218
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,722
Lucie, come on.
We have to go.

219
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,123
You should've seen his face
when he opened the door.

220
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,284
He recognized me, too.
I saw it in his eyes.

221
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,765
Now, Lucie,
before someone comes.

222
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,610
I can't help you here.

223
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,091
We have to get you
to a doctor,

224
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,083
someplace really far away.

225
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,086
After we get rid of the bodies
and clean the house back up.

226
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,480
We don't have time.

227
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,808
No, it's the only way
that it will leave me alone.

228
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,405
L-I have to wipe them away.

229
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,285
I have to make it like
they never existed.

230
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,091
Then it will have to let me go.

231
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,201
It's almost over.

232
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,961
Ready?

233
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,970
What's wrong?

234
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,240
Come here.
Come here, Anna.

235
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,530
- Can you smell that?
- Please stop.

236
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,045
Can you?

237
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,964
I've known that smell
my whole life...

238
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,690
from every time
that he beat me,

239
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,605
every time that he
walked into my cell.

240
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,331
And he told me
how perfect I was.

241
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,451
He told me I was the one
that they'd all been waiting for.

We need to get the others.

245
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,681
Why can't we just leave them?

246
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,207
I told you I have to do it.

247
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,483
It's the only way
it'll leave me alone.

Why would you help her?

What about all the things
she did to me?

I told you! I told you!

But you wanted her to live

No.

Then why would you
try to save her?

Why would you try to let her
do it all over again?

She wouldn't have hurt you.

00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,531
(sobs)

506
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,887
Anna! Anna!

507
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,926
No. N-no.

508
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,606
No, no, no.

509
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,520
Man: Thank you all
for gathering here today.

510
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,490
Please be seated
so we may begin.

511
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,240
(whimpering )

512
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,164
Hello again, Anna.

513
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,767
Help, somebody!

514
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,410
They can't hear you.

515
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,846
Not that it would matter.

516
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,365
They're all aware
of you being here.

517
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,126
What I said about calling
the police was true. I did.

518
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,282
I know.

519
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,842
It was your abbreviated 9-1-1 call
that alerted us.

520
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,288
That and your little excursion
downstairs to see Sam.

521
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,529
All outgoing calls
come through our system.

522
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,809
Without yours, we would've assumed
that the doctor's work with Sam

523
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,325
was proceeding as planned.

524
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,370
So I owe you my gratitude.

525
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:30,127
Without you, we would never
have gotten our dear Lucie back.

526
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,725
I didn't give her to you.

527
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,490
Of course you did.

528
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,961
What do you want with her?

529
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,440
Her gift, of course.

530
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,444
It's what kept her alive
during the doctor's work

531
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,483
when she was a child.

532
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,284
It's what gave her the strength

533
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,887
to spend all those years
trying to find him.

534
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:58,371
Lucie is very different,
of course.

535
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,485
But you already knew that,
didn't you, Anna?

536
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,648
You were ready to die back there
in your cell

537
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,246
rather than suffer any longer.

538
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,368
But Lucie is different.

539
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:12,443
Stronger.

540
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,001
What would kill you or I,

541
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,924
she can survive.

542
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,763
Well, physically, anyway.

543
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,366
Mentally, well...

544
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,889
...the monsters are there.

545
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,601
They've slipped through the cracks
that Dr. Patterson opened.

546
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,162
She's special.

547
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,608
It's easy to create a victim.

548
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,967
You lock a person up
in the dark,

549
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,406
and they begin to suffer.

550
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,642
And then you feed that suffering

551
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,644
methodically,
precisely to make it last.

552
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,246
The subject goes through
a number of states.

553
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,689
And then there is trauma,
and it opens those cracks.

554
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,851
Does Lucie ever see things
that aren't there?

555
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,241
Things that may want to hurt her?

556
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,564
Hmm.

557
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,401
These are victims,
and like you or I,

558
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,728
they reach a breaking point.

559
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,165
Martyrs are so much more.

560
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,209
They're so very rare.

561
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,811
So extraordinary.

562
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,246
Martyrs survive the pain,
the torture,

563
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,970
like our Lucie,

564
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,322
and they refuse to die.

565
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,205
Martyrs endure
the unspeakable sins of the Earth,

566
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,489
and they give themselves up

567
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,530
and transcend
their very being.

568
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,728
You are fucking crazy.

569
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,809
And when the police come,
they're gonna--

570
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,327
Don't speak about things
that you can't possibly understand.

571
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,768
Longsheng Province, 1912.

572
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,331
This woman was accused
of stealing food,

573
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,289
and she was being punished.

574
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,171
This photograph was taken of her
when she was alive.

575
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,084
Look at the eyes.

576
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,527
Juliette Ducier, 1945.

577
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,001
She was a grocer
who slept with a German.

578
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,401
At the time, that didn't sit well
with the French,

579
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,369
and she had to pay.

580
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,602
Her eyes still alive.

581
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,450
Birmingham, 1960.

582
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,443
A woman in the final stages
of cancer

583
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,965
beyond the use of morphine.

584
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,600
She was pronounced dead
a dozen times.

585
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,401
And yet she refused to die.

586
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,325
Again, the eyes.

587
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,962
All of them photographed
when they were alive,

588
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,283
all of them seeing something
in their final breaths.

589
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,289
That's what we're recreating.

590
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,811
And we're so close.

591
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,287
That's our hope with Lucie.

592
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,802
And a few rare others.

593
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,885
( Chanting )

594
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,047
No, no, no.

595
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,010
Don't feel badly for her, Anna.

596
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,448
- She welcomes this now.
- No, no. Don't do this!

597
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,523
( Screaming )

598
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,722
Anna: No! No!

599
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:16,168
' Stop!
<i>'</i> ( Screaming )

600
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,651
Stop it!

601
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,050
( Sobbing )

602
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,409
- ( screaming )
- Anna: No! No!

603
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:35,363
You have to look past
the pain, Anna.

604
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,522
- Past the human form.
- No.

605
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,444
To what's behind those eyes,
to what she sees.

606
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,366
- No!
- To that final place after life

607
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,329
that awaits us all.

608
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,363
That's what this is about?

609
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,922
Why you've been torturing
and killing people for years?

610
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,562
It isn't torture
when it's for a higher purpose.

611
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,361
We're developing their gift,
expanding their knowledge.

612
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,090
And these people
are here to see this?

613
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,205
They're looking for the answer
to the human race's greatest mystery.

614
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:12,441
We all are.

615
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,251
So you murder
for their entertainment?

616
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,166
I sacrifice for knowledge.

617
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,928
Why are you
showing me this?

618
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,562
I'd hoped to send you on your way
with some peace, Anna.

619
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,121
In appreciation
for your returning Lucie

620
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,282
to where she belonged.

621
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,880
Unfortunately,
I can't give you that, Anna.

622
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,811
No! N-no!

623
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,849
Bury her with the family.

624
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,809
And make the final preparations
for Lucie.

625
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,088
(whimpering )

626
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,848
( gasps )

627
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,721
( footsteps passing )

628
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,560
( gasps )

629
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,325
( engine starts )

630
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,005
( gasping )

631
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,321
No.

632
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,845
(dirt rushing)

633
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,366
( gasps )

634
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,569
(whimpering )

635
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,651
Exactly as Dr. Patterson
would've done it.

636
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,922
( Lucie gasping, moaning )

637
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,170
( gulps, panting )

638
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,569
(moaning )

639
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,920
( hyperventilating )

640
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,122
( flies buzzing )

641
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,521
(Anna coughs )

642
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,920
( groans )

643
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,683
(groaning )

644
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,847
( panting )

645
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,209
( hyperventilating )

646
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,844
( sobbing )

647
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:38,880
( screams )

648
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,805
( hyperventilating )

649
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,406
( screaming )

650
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,208
( distant screaming )

651
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,081
( screaming continues )

652
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,765
( panting )

653
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,771
( screaming continues )

654
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,248
( distant voices )

655
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:09,282
(voices chanting )

656
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,890
( Anna screaming )

657
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,405
(grunts)

658
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,883
(yells )

659
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,402
(grunting )

660
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,171
Hey!

661
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,765
Stand up.

662
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,365
- Turn around.
- ( screams )

663
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,968
( shells clatter)

664
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,406
( panting )

665
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,881
Lucie?

666
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:43,725
Lucie?

667
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,251
( Anna screams )

668
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,402
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
I have to find my friend.

669
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,562
I'll come back for you.

670
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:55,881
Lucie?

671
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,605
Where is she?

672
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,125
Drop it.

673
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,328
Put it down.

674
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:35,289
Kill him!

675
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,682
Samantha: Anna!

676
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,727
(yells )

677
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:42,961
Anna!

678
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,528
Anna!

679
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:49,684
- ( Keysjingling)
- Anna!

680
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,403
I'm getting you out of here.

681
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,606
Ready?

682
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,405
I have to stay
and find my friend.

683
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,404
I need you to run, Sam,
as fast as you can.

684
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:05,688
Find a house, get someone
and tell them about this place.

685
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,251
Please.
(whimpers )

686
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,401
It'll be okay.

687
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:09,561
(whimpers )

688
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,041
You won't have to be scared,
not anymore, okay?

689
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,851
Go! Go! Go!

690
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:24,884
This is the one.

691
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,526
It has to be her.
It has to be.

692
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,450
(Anna panting )

693
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,489
- ( yells )
- ( screams )

694
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,883
( screaming )

695
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,561
Lucie.

696
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,721
Help.

697
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,401
Help!

698
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,962
(whimpering )

699
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,761
Man: Oh, Lord, we rejoice
in the suffering of thy child.

700
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,763
Through her pain,
may we truly know

701
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,809
the mysteries that are yours.

702
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,086
- Through our--

703
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,083
( screaming )

704
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,611
Get away from her.

705
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,926
Take her down.

706
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,285
Lucie. Lucie.

707
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:11,441
Lucie.

708
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,167
Man: She's there.

709
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,651
She sees. I'm sure of it.

710
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,131
Take her down!

711
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,126
Lucie!

712
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,689
Lucie.

713
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,126
Man: She's there.

714
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,161
Take her down.

715
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,482
No. You could push her
past the point of endurance.

716
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:47,971
Take her down!

717
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,523
You'll let her die in vain.

718
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:14,841
Stay away from her!

719
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,685
All of her pain
will have been worth nothing.

720
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,525
She knows the answer
the rest of the world

721
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,170
has fought
countless battles over.

722
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,647
- Shut up!
- Destroyed civilizations.

723
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,609
Please don't waste her suffering!

724
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,807
( Screaming )

725
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,281
Man: She's trying to speak.

726
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,443
Could you...

727
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,160
(whispering )

728
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,041
- ( voices whispering )
- Man: Can you hear what she's saying?

729
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:03,884
- Man #2: What is it?
- Man #3: Is she describing it?

730
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,408
- Man #4: I've got to find out.
- Woman: What did she see?

731
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,769
What did she say?
She was there, wasn't she?

732
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,681
I heard her.

733
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,881
(gunshot)

734
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,042
Father!

735
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,767
What did she say?
She was there, wasn't she?

736
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,081
What did she say?

737
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,369
What was it?
What did she see?

738
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,130
You tell me.

739
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,281
(gunshot)

740
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,608
( screaming )

741
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,410
( groans )

742
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:51,284
( sirens wailing )

743
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,529
I'm so sorry.

744
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,451
(girls laughing )

745
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,480
I wish I could ride a cloud.

746
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,086
Let it take me wherever I wanted.

747
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,682
Where would you want to go?

748
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,124
Wherever you go.

749
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,924
