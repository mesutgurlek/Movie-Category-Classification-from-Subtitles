He imported these fish from Japan.

to replenish their ranks.

- No.

01:10:27,559 --> 01:10:28,892
I took it from them.

817
01:10:29,093 --> 01:10:30,629
- You can't have this.
- They stoled it.

818
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:32,730

821

Sally, I trust you,

822
01:10:45,109 --> 01:10:48,588
and you can tell me anything,
anything at all.

823

Then I have a good idea.

827
01:11:13,137 --> 01:11:14,839
Mr. Jacoby, I am so glad
you could make it.

828
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,873
- Alex, call me Charles.
- Charles.

01:11:16,874 --> 01:11:18,374
- My wife, Evelyn.
- Hello, Alex.

absolutely fantastic.
