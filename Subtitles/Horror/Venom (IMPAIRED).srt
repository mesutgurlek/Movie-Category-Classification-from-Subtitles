00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,806
Grandma was a mambo,
like her mother before her.

452
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,477
It's in our blood, Eden.

453
00:42:07,223 --> 00:42:12,209
For generations,
people would come here to worship.

454
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,727
It's a religion, like any other.

455
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:19,149
It's full of spirits - both good and evil.

456
00:42:22,264 --> 00:42:24,369
They're called loas.

457
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:28,660
Grandma helped a lot of people here.

458
00:42:28,728 --> 00:42:30,703
She was a good woman.

459
00:42:32,025 --> 00:42:34,840
Your grandmother was wearing this.

460
00:42:37,562 --> 00:42:39,983
It's a baka.

461
00:42:40,442 --> 00:42:42,995
It's a charm that protects against evil.

462
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:48,277
What was she doing
out so late last night?

463
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:54,293
You know over in Cypress,
where they're building that new mill?

464
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,429
There's an old Creole burial ground there.

465
00:42:57,499 --> 00:43:00,728
She was afraid of what
someone might find if they started digging.

466
00:43:00,795 --> 00:43:02,934
The suitcase?

467
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,609
Grandma saved souls.

468
00:43:09,596 --> 00:43:12,051
Murderers,

469
00:43:12,124 --> 00:43:14,580
sadists,

470
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:16,888
the most vile men.

471
00:43:18,877 --> 00:43:21,048
She milked them of evil.

472
00:43:21,917 --> 00:43:23,772
What was in that suitcase, Cece?

473
00:43:23,837 --> 00:43:27,961
Every soul that she ever milked...

474
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:29,852
was inside that suitcase.

475
00:43:30,653 --> 00:43:34,134
So if those snakes got set free
and if they killed Ray,

476
00:43:34,206 --> 00:43:38,941
the evil of countless souls
is inside of him right now...

477
00:43:39,966 --> 00:43:43,033
possessing his body.

478
00:43:43,102 --> 00:43:46,136
You're really
starting to scare me, Cece.

479
00:43:46,975 --> 00:43:50,870
You said it yourself.
You saw his truck outside the cemetery.

480
00:43:50,943 --> 00:43:55,765
Now his only instinct will be to kill
and to sacrifice to the dark loas.

481
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,774
Nobody's safe, Eden.

482
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:00,636
Nobody's safe.

483
00:44:04,032 --> 00:44:06,399
Should we go now?

484
00:44:06,464 --> 00:44:10,654
She's really out of it. I mean, she's saying
some weird stuff. I think she needs help.

485
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:14,103
- What's wrong?
- I don't know, but there's no phone here.

486
00:44:14,176 --> 00:44:18,170
- Do you have your cell?
- Like we're gonna have reception here?

487
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:21,590
Listen. You guys need to go to my house,
get my mom and bring her here.

488
00:44:21,665 --> 00:44:23,902
Call the sheriff.
Make sure he gets here too.

489
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,272
What is going on, Eden?

490
00:44:26,338 --> 00:44:28,607
I don't know, OK?
Just hurry.

491
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:30,846
I'll stay with Cece.

492
00:44:30,914 --> 00:44:32,605
Let's go.

493
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:34,590
Let's go.

494
00:44:44,643 --> 00:44:48,538
- I sent Rachel and Ricky for help.
- You should've gone too.

495
00:44:48,611 --> 00:44:50,848
Grandma's dead.

496
00:44:50,915 --> 00:44:55,171
I'm the only descendant left.
Ray Sawyer will come here.

497
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:59,514
He'll want me dead,
and he will kill anyone in his path.

498
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:02,752
- You need help, Cece.
- There is no help.

499
00:45:04,293 --> 00:45:08,800
You saw Ray at the cemetery because
he needs a sacred place to worship.

500
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:14,685
Reaping the souls of all that he kills
is his only purpose now.

501
00:45:15,206 --> 00:45:17,148
And he won't stop.

502
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:23,396

503

Come on, come on.

507
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:44,453
What the fuck?

508
00:45:46,855 --> 00:45:50,117
My fucking car!
I can't believe this.

509
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:59,363
- That's what the bottom of a car looks like.
- I don't think that's funny.

510
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:07,560
Is that Ray's truck?

511

Aaaargh! Aaaargh!

- We have to get out of here.
- No. We have to stay here. It's safe here.

536
00:48:02,162 --> 00:48:04,137
- No, it's not safe here!
- Yes, it is!

537
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,250
The house is spelled.
He can't come in.

538
00:48:06,322 --> 00:48:10,414
- Oh, God! Ricky.
- Rachel, it's gonna be OK.

539
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:19,470
What the hell is he doing?

540
00:48:39,861 --> 00:48:42,709
How... how can he be alive?

541
00:48:42,773 --> 00:48:46,189
We need a gun.
Did your grandmother have a gun?

542
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:48,683
- It won't help.
- Where's the fucking gun?

543
00:48:48,757 --> 00:48:51,659
I don't know.
The bedroom.

544
00:48:54,742 --> 00:48:56,979
Rachel.

545
00:48:57,462 --> 00:48:58,640
We're safe here.

546
00:48:58,711 --> 00:49:01,428
You're kidding, right?
Did you see that fucking thing?

547
00:49:01,494 --> 00:49:03,796
This house has been blessed.

548
00:49:03,863 --> 00:49:07,475
- It's protected against evil.
- Fucking great.

549
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:11,318
I'm glad your grandma hexed the house
when she should have installed a phone.

550
00:49:25,848 --> 00:49:27,572
Jesus.

Sean, come on!
Come on!

- He killed Ricky.

It's OK. We're safe in here.
We're safe, right?

560
00:50:13,564 --> 00:50:16,019
The altar room will be safest.

561
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,842
- That thing can't be Ray.
- It's Ray, Sean.

Yeah, but Ray's dead.

Sean, no!

He's just standing there.

591

How do we stop that thing, Cece?

592
00:53:07,785 --> 00:53:10,207
With the baka.

593
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:18,341
Grandma says it has power over the evil,
but without her, I don't know.

594
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,680
- It's impossible.
- No.

595

There has to be another way.

596
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:26,979
You know this voodoo stuff. Can't you, like,
demilk him with a ritual or something?

597
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:28,873
That's real mambo work.

598
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:32,715
I only know the little things,
like dolls and spells and...

599
00:53:33,771 --> 00:53:36,706
I can't.

<i>(Eric) He's gone again.</i>

He didn't go far.

602
00:53:46,252 --> 00:53:49,930
- I can make a doll.
- A doll? What would that do?

603
00:53:49,997 --> 00:53:53,412
The evil is inside Ray's body.
I can't stop that.

604
00:53:53,485 --> 00:53:57,315
But maybe I can stop his body
long enough for us to get out of here.

605
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:00,685
- It's worth a try.
- Are you talking about a voodoo doll?

606
00:54:00,749 --> 00:54:04,678
If I had something of Ray's,
like some hair or some clothing,

607
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:07,620
some actual part of him,
I could make a doll...

608
00:54:07,694 --> 00:54:11,524
So who's gonna go outside
and pull a lock of hair?

609
00:54:15,663 --> 00:54:18,510
- Will blood work?
- What are you talking about?

610

Making a human voodoo doll?
