in the last six months? Huh?

a couple years after

used to feed live cattle...

00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:59,556
to a couple of
40-foot prehistoric crocs

prone to exaggeration,
if you get my drift.

145
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,278
And crocodiles don't live
as far north as Maine, Frank.

146
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,531
If there really was one up here,
I'm sure it would've been
a newsworthy occurrence.

147
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,700
Maybe. But that's not
the kind of thing...

"and roll over and over
until the disoriented prey
drowns or bleeds to death.

448
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,420
It's called a 'death roll."'

449
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,464
Sounds like
something to avoid.
Oh, yeah.

Well, you know,

"It wedges the body
of its victim...

into an underwater pantry
for future consumption."

453

Well, when we're through here,
we'll have plenty of crocodile
steaks in our pantry, eh?

I got a question
for the two of youse.

Let me ask you this,

What are you plannin'
on usin' for bait?

458

[ Sighs ]
Sorry about this, baby.

You're kidding.
That's your bait?

Come on.
[ Grunts ]

00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,625
There’s no way
this is gonna work.
Come on, Dale.

462
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,461
Crocodiles eat turtles.
Looked it up in Struthers's book.
Get in there.

He's one heck
of a turtle.

I don't like this plan.
They growed up
in a hole like this.

00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,016
Dale, would you be quiet?

466
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:48,025
Well, now,
that is absolutely brilliant.

467
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,777
You do realize the thing
has eaten a human being, don't you?

468
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,280
That’s right.
Get in there, Struthers.

469
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,201
Suppose you'd prefer
if we just lobbed in
a land mine?

470
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,830
Nah, it's way too messy.

the sport in that?

No, no, no, no!
Don't even think about it.

Can you help me
get this thing out of here
before it hurts itself?

We'll get it.

No. And two.

- Yes, sir.

Come on!
Tranq gun, right now!

Don't mind me, guys.

my little monkeys there
don't get toasty.

I'm completely rich? Filthy?

[ James ]
Where'd you find-
Ahmad, is it?

531
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:09,160
Yeah, me one-man army.
In the Sudan,
I was on safari.

532
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,372
Heard about this lion
that was terrorizing
a small village.

533
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,374
Killed 16 natives.

534
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,252
I went looking for it,
but I couldn't find
anything for two weeks.

535
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:20,714
Then one night,
I hear this wild screaming
from the brush.

536
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,633
Ahmad had found it
gnawing on his mother's throat.

537
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,178
And even though he was barely
a teenager, he jumped on it
with his bare hands.

538
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,432
Put up a hell of a fight.
So that's where he got
the scars, huh?

539
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,268
I don't suppose
there's any unsolved crime
in your town, is there, Sheriff?

540
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,979
I don't suppose there's any more
to your story, is there?
Afraid so.

541
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,398
All right.
Anyhow,
I heard the commotion.

542
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,651
I run on in and kill the beast,
and Ahmad's been with me ever since.

543
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,821
He comes in very handy
when there's a bit
of dirty work to be done.

544
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,616
Sounds to me like
you're taking advantage
of the situation.

545
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,123
All set, boss.

546
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,504
There it is.
I've never seen
anything like it before.

547
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,923
What is it,
girls' panties?
[ Chuckles ]

548
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,676
Funny stuff.
You should take your act
on the road.

549
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,762
Maybe open up
for Jeff Foxworthy.

550
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,139
I wish.
That guy's hilarious.

551
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,934
So, where is it?
It's right there.

552
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,978
Holy shit!

553
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,522
It's creepy.
It looks like
a grave or something.

00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,733
Totally.
Let's check it out up close.

555
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,860
Uh, I think
that's a bad idea.

556
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,945
Yeah, Thad, I agree.
I think we should
get out of here.

557
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,531
You both do what you want.
I'm checkin' it out.

Sporting purpose
automatic shotgun.

561

SPAS12.
That's what they call an acronym.

562
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,387
I know what an acronym is,
Struthers.

563
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,847
You never cease
to amaze me, Sheriff.
[ Chuckles ]

564
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,892
Anyway, I dropped a black bear
in Montana with this.

565
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,979
Six rounds at close range,
and it fell like a sack of... nails.

566
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,690
You know, I never
quite understood the whole
"sport of the hunting" thing.

567
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,735
I prefer sports
where my opponent
knows they're playing.

568
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,821
Ah.

569
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,741
That’s a nice gun.
What the heck is that?

570
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:17,539
This, my friend,
is a Milkor MGL-140
grenade launcher.

571
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,541
Hit point targets
from 200 feet,

572
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:24,337
area targets from 400,
and it doesn't matter
whether you're drunk or sober.

573
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,052
After seeing what we're
up against, that little baby
just might come in handy.

574
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,179
Oh, yeah.
Here.

575
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,855
Emma.

576
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:47,152
Hey.
You all right?

577
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,240
You gotta
snap out of it, girl.

578
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,200
You made a call.
You did what
you thought was right.

579
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,120
I killed them.

580
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,331
Sure, they're-
they're dead.

581
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,126
They got chewed up
into little pieces.

582
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,420
But they knew
what was going on
when they went in.

583
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:09,299
They chose to do it anyway.
Come on. It's not your fault.

584
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,761
Look, the important thing
right now...

585
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,764
is that we stop this thing
before it kills
either one of us.

586
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,975
Right?

587
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,561
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to make sure that...

588
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,939
Struthers and his pal
don't destroy this
entire lake in the process.

589
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,066
There’s still some good fish
in this lake.

some damn answers from you.

01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:02,319
I'd ask you all in for
a nightcap, but I think you'd
all look better in a dunce cap.

Listen, Sadie.
For crying out loud-

This is serious.
People’s lives
are at stake.

Too bad you can't talk
to my sister. I heard she had
quite a history with crocodiles.

right now somewhere
with his friends.

My son, Sadie. Please.
Maybe I know
a little something.

That’s great.
Anything you can
tell us will help.

There are three of 'em.

Okay?
Three of 'em.

01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,193
There’s Max.

909
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,237
I named him after
my late husband,

910
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,323
'cause he was always hungry
like Max was.

Then there's, um, George Jr.,

'cause he was slow too.

And the last one was

Pretty tough bird
in her own right.

How do you know
she's female?

She got a mean streak
I ain't ever seen in no man.

Also-

919

[ Whispers ]
I caught George Jr....

trying to stick it to her
one night on the shore.

Pardon me?

Don't tell me you're
one of those vegetarians.

No. That meat is pumped
so full of growth hormones,

935
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,275
I'm surprised those crocs
are still alive.

936

Well, I can't afford three tons
of Kobe beef a month.

My Social Security checks
ain't what they used to be.

This is all you've
been feeding 'em, Sadie?

I've noticed they've been
a lot hungrier lately.

Yesterday Martha ate
a big rat off my dock.

and find those kids.

Oh, no. Scott! Scott!

That’s not Scott.
I recognize that sneaker.

[ Sighs ]
Just make sure you

Wait. Dad.
Please, let me help you.

I don't have time
to explain this to you
again right now, Son.

1055

What if you don't
make it back?
Then what?

1056

If anything were to happen
to you out there, I'd never
be able to forgive myself.

pretty well situated
back at the campsite.

Well, can you see the nest?

No. But I can see the sheriff.
Riley! Over here.

1076

you to wait back at the camp.

1079

Well, Struthers was gonna
get up high enough
to see the nest, but-

1080
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:11,255
Come on, Struthers.
Stop loafing. Get up there.

A good Scout always
has a plan "B."

So, do you really think
it's gonna eat
one of these things?

1087
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:36,697
It doesn't actually have to
eat one of these things.
It just has to get...

1088
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:41,536
close enough
so that I can ruin its day
when I push this button.

1089

[ Chuckles ]

1090
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,542

than hoping Struthers
gets off a good shot, right?

1091
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:49,502
[ Chuckles ]
Come on.

Thank you.
I didn't know anybody
lived out here.

Yeah. Just me.

But I get visitors

Do you have any kids?

Could say so.

1098
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,298
Two of them died recently.

1099
01:16:40,345 --> 01:16:42,597
They were good boys.

1100

I loved them a whole lot.

1101

Three of my friends
died out there.

1102
01:16:48,186 --> 01:16:51,647
They were eaten by these
big ugly monsters.

1103
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,527
Ugly? Is that so?

1104
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,946
Yeah.

1105
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:01,282
You should have seen 'em.

1106

Big, nasty creatures.

1107
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:05,703
They were vicious.

Nothing, dear.

Will you do an old lady
a favor?

1112
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,221
Sure.

1113
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:36,817
I don't like it out here.
I want to go back inside.

1114
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:40,154
She's right. It's probably
safer inside your house,
Mrs. Bickerman.

01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,657
Okay. Don't be such wusses.

I want to show Kerri
something.

[ Chirping ]

1202
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:17,945
So, how are our
passengers doing?
Oh, they seem to be fine.

1203
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:20,155
Just watch the bumps.

1204
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,241
I'll watch the bumps.

1205
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,996
How much further
is this place?
About two hours.

1206
01:25:28,081 --> 01:25:30,290
We can stop in Bangor
for dinner, if you want.

1207
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,460
Really?

1208
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:37,714
So finally giving me
a second chance
at another date, huh?

1209
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:41,176
On one condition.
What's that?

1210
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:43,846
No talking about ex-wives
or crocodiles.

1211
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:45,848
Deal?

1212
01:25:45,932 --> 01:25:47,933
Deal.
