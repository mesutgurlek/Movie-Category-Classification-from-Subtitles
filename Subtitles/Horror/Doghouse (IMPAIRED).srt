I'm Neil. What's your name, babe?

that you can't find in London?

She's off on a cruise
while the builders are in.

For fuck's sake!

936
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,249
Vince, you do know the road's blocked.

937
01:17:55,417 --> 01:17:59,583
Bollocks to the roadblock. I've been
living by the highway code all my life.

938
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:03,374
Where did it get me?
A one-way ticket to Moodley.

939
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:07,708
Buckle up, lads.
We're going off road.

940
01:18:12,834 --> 01:18:14,999
Whoo!

941
01:18:25,584 --> 01:18:29,124
Vince, watch out for the old biddy.

942
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:32,708
Whoa, easy, easy!

943
01:18:42,334 --> 01:18:44,166
Oh, my God!

944
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,708
What was that?

945
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:54,916
Fat bird.

946
01:18:56,292 --> 01:18:58,541
Slow down, Vince. Slow down.

947
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:33,666
Hello, hello...

948
01:19:39,084 --> 01:19:41,166
Hello? Is anybody there?

949
01:19:41,334 --> 01:19:44,666
Graham, we thought you got squashed.
Where are you?

950
01:19:44,834 --> 01:19:48,041
In the nest with the stiffs.

951
01:19:48,209 --> 01:19:50,291
(GRAHAM) Where are you?

952
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:53,791
Coming to get you, silly twat.

953
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,958
(NEIL) Let's do it.

Who's your favourite Spice Girl?

956
01:21:01,959 --> 01:21:06,416
Here's the plan. We're gonna
go down there, get Graham,

957
01:21:06,584 --> 01:21:09,833
piss off to the nearest pub,
somewhere much nicer than this,

958
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,249
have a little bit of lunch and then get
absolutely shit-faced. Any questions?

959
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:16,999
Yeah.

960
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:21,291
You do realise
that we're slightly outnumbered, right?

961
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:23,666
Pass one of them golf clubs.

962
01:21:23,834 --> 01:21:26,791
No, give me a wood.

963
01:21:26,959 --> 01:21:29,041
Give him wood as well.

964
01:21:39,834 --> 01:21:43,291
Right. We're outnumbered,
and outgunned.

965
01:21:43,459 --> 01:21:45,666
But I've got the hump.

966
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:49,999
So we're gonna go down there
in a very ungentlemanly fashion

967
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:53,374
and... present company
excepted, of course,

out of anything in a dress.

01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,833
...not very PC is it?

971
01:22:24,417 --> 01:22:25,541
Come on.

Oi, oi!

You all right?

977
01:23:00,292 --> 01:23:02,291
I've got it working.

Get in there, Graham.

Absolutely lovin' it.

Whoa, whoa!
