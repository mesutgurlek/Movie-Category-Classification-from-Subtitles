00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,600
(gun being loaded)

7
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,500
(gunshot)

8
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:43,700
(engine revving and screaming)

9
00:02:42,400 --> 00:03:09,700
(eerie music)

10
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,200
(Anderson) YOU'RE
NEVER GONNA SLEEP AGAIN.

11
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,200
(Hallaway) THAT'S THE POINT.

12
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,200
RIGHT.

13
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,800

18
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,100
THREE SURVIVING WITNESSES...

23
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,400
HOT CHOCOLATE.

29
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,700
THEY'RE GUESSING.

30
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,200
WITH KIDS, IT'S DIFFERENT.

31
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'LL BE FINE BY IT. HOW 'BOUT YOU?

32
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,500
UH-HUH.

33
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,100
SHE'S GONNA BE A MESS.

34
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,800
AH, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE SAW.

35
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,300
FUCK, ANDERSON! WE KNOW.

36
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,500
LISTEN...

37
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,300
THEY CALL 'EM WITNESSES
BECAUSE THEY'VE SEEN THINGS.

38
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,100
SO WE GO IN, FIND OUT.

39
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,400
YOU GOOD?

40
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,900
I'M GOOD.

41
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,500

42
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,200

43
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,200
BILLINGS...

44
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,500
AGENT HALLAWAY.

45
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,300
AND THIS IS OFFICER
DEGRASSO...OFFICER WRIGHT.

46
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,500
AGENT ANDERSON.

47
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,100
AH.

48
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,800
UH, UP-TO-DATE WITNESS
FILES, THEY ALL DESCRIBE

49
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,900
THE SAME THING. HASN'T
GOTTEN US MUCH OF ANYWHERE.

50
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,100
WE'RE PRETTY SURE WE KNOW
WHAT WERE DEALING WITH HERE.

51
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,700
AND THEY ALL ARRIVED
TOGETHER, LATE YESTERDAY?

52
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
YEAH, THAT'S THE WAY IT HAPPENED.

53
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,900
ONE OF OUR OFFICERS BROUGHT THEM
IN, UH HE'S IN THERE TOO, HE...

54
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,500
HE'S ALSO A WITNESS.

55
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,600
I UNDERSTAND ONE OF
YOUR OFFICERS WAS KILLED?

56
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,900
YEAH. JIM. JIM CONRAD.

57
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,600
NOW, UH THE YOUNG WOMAN...

58
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,300
SHE SEEMS TO BE INTOXICATED
OR IN SHOCK; THE CHILD...

59
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,900
THE 'YOUNG WOMAN' IS
HIGH AS A FUCKIN' KITE.

60
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,100
AS I WAS SAYING...

61
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,100
THE CHILD HASN'T SAID MUCH OF ANYTHING.

62
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,300
HOWEVER, SHE HAS BONDED
WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN...

63
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,800
BOBBI...BOBBI PRESCOTT.

64
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,300
AND IS THIS ALL SHE SAID?

65
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,100
UH, YEAH, ONLY WHAT WE TOOK NOTES ON.

66
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,300
THE...THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED
TO HER, YOU CAN'T BLAME HER.

67
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,400
AND YOU HAVE NO FEMALE
OFFICERS HERE, IS THAT RIGHT?

68
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
HAVE TWO OF YOU ALWAYS BEEN PRESENT?

69
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,800
WELL I WAS THERE... HI, I'M JANET.

70
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,500
WELCOME, I COULD, CAN
I GET COFFEE FOR ANY...

71
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,000
YOU KNOW, THAT LITTLE GIRL'S
NAME, HER NAME'S STEPHANIE...

72
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,100
'CAUSE OFFICER BENNETT TOLD ME
THAT HER NAME WAS STEPHANIE...

73
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,200
WE'LL NEED TO SEPARATE
THEM FOR THE INTERVIEWS.

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,700
THEY REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
KEPT APART DURING THE NIGHT...

75
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,400
I TRUST MY OFFICER.

76
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,800
I NEVER SAID I DIDN'T...UH...

77
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,800
YOU KNOW...I'M SURE THAT
PROPER PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED,

78
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,700
AGENT HALLAWAY.

79
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,200
IT'S JUST...INTERESTING...THAT
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT BROUGHT UP

80
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,600
THE TRUST THING.

81
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,300
GREAT. UH, SAM?

82
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,400
I'M GONNA TAKE A MINUTE

83
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,500

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,500
SO, WE BROUGHT EQUIPMENT WITH US,

85
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,500
WHILE I'M IN TALKING
WITH HER, YOU GUYS SET IT

86
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,900
UP...ROOMS...CAMERAS.

87
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,300
EVERYBODY WORK TOGETHER,
WE'RE GONNA GET GOING FASTER.

88
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600
RIGHT-RIGHT IN HERE?

89
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,400
DO, DO YOU THINK IF I

90
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,200
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM...

91
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:03,200
HEY, STEPHANIE, MY NAME IS
ELIZABETH...AND WE'RE GONNA TRY

92
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,700
AND TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, OKAY?

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,900
AND IT'S GONNA HELP YOU FEEL BETTER.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200

95
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,200

YOU GONNA BUST ME?

97
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,600
FOR NOW, NO.

98
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,400
THE ONLY ROLE YOUR NARCOTIC
USE PLAYS IS IN HOW IT MAY HAVE

99
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,400
AFFECTED YOUR PERCEPTION
OF THE EVENTS...

100
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,600
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

101
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,900
YEAH.

102
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,600
SO WHATCHA GOT THERE,
STEPHANIE? A VIDEO GAME?

103
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,900
YOU LIKE PLAYING GAMES? HMM?

104
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,400
SO...

105
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,900
THERE'S A...

106
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,900
PAIR OF PANTS UNDER THAT SKIRT, HUH?

107
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,400
UH, YOU KNOW THE EQUIPMENT
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT...

108
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,200
IT'S IN THE TRUNK OF MY CAR.

109
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,800
(Wright) I'M ON IT!

110
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,700
ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE A BIT OF
EQUIPMENT, CAPTAIN, SO...MAYBE,

111
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,200
DEGRASSO.

112
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,900
GIVE WRIGHT A HAND.

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,100
C'MON NOW.

114
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,500
AGENT, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

115
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,700
UH...IT'S JUST PROCEDURE,

116
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
I LIKE TO SEPARATE 'EM, PUT 'EM ON TAPE.

117
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,300
I KNOW ONE OF YOUR OFFICERS IS IN THERE,

118
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,200
BUT...THERE'S ONLY ONE
WAY TO UNFOLD A NOTE,

119
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
SO TO SPEAK...WITHOUT TEARING THE PAPER.

120
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,200
YEAH THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.

121
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,200
SO LET'S LOOK AND SEE WHAT WE'RE....

122
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,700
WELL THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

123
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,600
UH... YOU GOT A CIGARETTE?

124
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,800
NO, SORRY.

125
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,900
AH.

126
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:26,700
¶¶

127
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,400
STEPHANIE?

128
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,700
WE'RE GONNA TALK, RIGHT?

129
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,800
I WANT TO GO HOME.....

130
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,800
I KNOW YOU DO, STEPHANIE...

131
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,700
I KNOW.

132
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,300
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDIN' ME?

133
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,100
JANET!

134
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,400
COULD YOU GET US A LIGHT IN HERE?

135
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,800
IT IS FUCKING DARK IN
HERE. THERE'S NO LIGHT!

136
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,700
RIGHT...YEAH, THESE WERE....

137
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,300
(Hallaway) THESE SHOULDN'T
BE BE HERE, TAKE 'EM DOWN.

138
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,800
(Billings) YEAH...

139
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,400
YOU GUYS GIVE ME A
HAND WHEN YOU'RE DONE?

140
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,000
DO YOU HAVE SOME CRAYONS IN YOUR BAG?

141
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,800
THEY WERE IN THE CAR.

142
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,200
I HAVE SOME CRAYONS,
I THINK, IN THE OFFICE.

143
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,200
OH, GREAT. COULD YOU GET THOSE, JANET?

144
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,900
YEAH. AND, UH, SOME PAPER... AND...

145
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,100
I THINK I'M GONNA BRING BACK
SOME MORE MARSHMALLOWS, OKAY?

146
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
STEPHANIE?

147
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,500
SO WHILE WE'RE TALKING YOU COULD
DO SOME DRAWING FOR ME, YEAH?

148
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,700
I GOTTA...I GOTTA GO TO THE BATHROOM.

149
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,300
OKAY. IN A MINUTE.

150
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,100
THAT AGENT LADY, YOU KNOW, SHE
WANTS THESE FOR THE LITTLE GIRL.

151
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
CRAYONS?

152
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,700
HOO! ...BOY

153
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,700
THOSE F.B.I. AGENTS...THINK OF
THINGS NO BEAT COP EVER WOULD.

154
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,300
(goofy laugh)

155
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,800
WHAT...IS THE MATTER?
WHAT, ARE YOU TWO YEARS OLD?

156
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,300
SO YOU KNOW, RIGHT?

157
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,900
I'M SORRY?

158
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,200

160
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,400
OFFICER?

161

I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A REALLY ROUGH TIME...

162
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,400
BUT LET'S WORK TOWARDS

00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,400
STOPPED. TO STRETCH.

331
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,800

332
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,100
STRETCHING.

333
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,100
IT'S GOOD.

334
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,400
AND THAT'S WHEN WE FIRST SAW
THE LITTLE GIRL, STEPHANIE.

335
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,000
STOP! SERIOUSLY! GOD DAMN IT, STOP!

336
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,900
WHY, WHADDYA HAVE TO PEE?

337
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,100
DON'T ACT LIKE AN
ASSHOLE. THERE'S A FAMILY.

338
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,100
HEY, IT'S THE ELEPHANT AT THE
REST STOP NOBODY TALKS ABOUT.

339
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,500
OH, OK, 'BILL W.' OH. HELLO.

340
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,400
(Snorts)

341
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,500
(Television Reporter) WHERE
A GRISLY DISCOVERY WAS MADE.

342
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,200
POLICE FEEL CERTAIN THAT
THIS IS THE WORK OF THE TWO,

343
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,700
AS YET UNIDENTIFIED SUSPECTS,
WHO HAVE LEFT A SERIES OF

344
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,700
VICTIMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

345
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,900
A PRESS CONFERENCE IS SCHEDULED
FOR LATER THIS AFTERNOON AFTER

346
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,900
FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE SCENE
AND THE BODY DISCOVERED INSIDE.

347
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,800
POLICE URGE ALL CITIZENS OF THE AREA TO

348
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,000
KEEP THEIR DOORS LOCKED,
AND TO IMMEDIATELY REPORT ANY

349
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,900
ACTIVITIES THAT APPEAR OUT
OF THE NORMAL...AS WELL AS ANY

350
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,200
SIGHTINGS OF THE MISSING WOMAN,
ELAINE MEYER, PICTURED HERE.

351
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,800
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO
WATCH THE NEWS AT HOME.

352
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,500
SOME THINGS CHILDREN SHOULDN'T SEE.

353
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,100
THAT'S WHAT MY MOM SAYS...

354
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,900
I MEAN...SAID.

355
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,600
I'M SO SORRY, STEPHANIE.

356
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,500
OH.

357
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,600
THAT POOR LITTLE GIRL...

358
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,200
CHILDREN CAN BE VERY RESILIENT.

359
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,400
I THINK IT'S A SHAME MAKIN G
HER RE-LIVE ALL THOSE THINGS...

360
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
NO, I MEAN, I KNOW, OF COURS
E YOU'RE JUST DOING YOUR JOB,

361
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,600
I KNOW THAT...IT'S JUST...YOU
HAVE TO DO THIS, RIGHT?

362
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,200
I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'VE SEEN.

363
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,500
UH...

364
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,900
EVERY DETAIL, RIGHT?

365
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,100
OH YEAH...OH YEAH. EVERY DETAIL.

366
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
OH GOD, I JUST...I JUST...OH.

367
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,600
YOU NEED THE INFORMATION
AND SPEAKING OF...

368
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,800
IT'S THE CORONER'S REPORT.

369
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,100
I'M 'FRIENDS' WITH THE CORONER.

370
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,700
YEAH.

371
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,000
WELL...THANK YOU.

372
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,600
YOU'RE WELCOME.

373
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,300
UM...NO LAB RESULTS?

374
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,800
NO, NO, HE'S RUSHING THOSE BUT
HE SAID IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE

375
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,900
HIM A LONG TIME TO COLLECT IT ALL.

376
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,300
DID HE SAY WHAT HE'S COLLECTING?

377
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,700
I MEAN, DID HE MENTION...

378
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,500
BALLISTICS?

379
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,400
NO. BUT YOU KNOW HE IS
BIG ON HAIR AND FIBERS.

380
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,200
IT'S KIND OF HIS...SPECIALTY.

381
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,200
APPARENTLY THEY LEFT A LOT OF THAT.

382
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WONDERING?

383
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,000
WHY WOULD THEY BE SO SLOPPY?

384
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,600
THEY'RE LIKELY TO IMPROVE.

385
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,100
OH. OF COURSE. YEAH.

386
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,400
UNLESS, MA'AM...

387
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,300
THEY JUST DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

388
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,900
OH MY GOD...

389
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,900
WHAT WE DO TO EACH OTHER, HUH?

390
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,100
MMH.

391
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,000
WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOIN' IN HERE?

392
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,200
THE UH, THE GIRL...BOBBI?

393
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,000
SHE HAD TO PISS.

394
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,600
AH.

395
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,300
WHY DON'T YOU GO AND MAKE
SURE SHE GETS BACK IN THE ROOM?

396
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,300
GO ON NOW...

397
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,100
OKAY!

398
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,700
AND WHY DON'T YOU GO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

399
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,100
ALRIGHT. THEN?

400
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,400
WE HAVE, UH, AREAS WE PATROL.

401
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,200
OOOOOH!

402
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,200
NICE SHOT!

403
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,800
LOOKIT HIM!

404
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,500
ALRIGHT.

405
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,600
PICK YOUR FUCKIN' PERSONALITY.

406
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,300
I GET TO PICK?

407
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,700
I AM CLEARLY 'GOOD COP.'

408
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,400
MMM...THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

409
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,700
FRIEND TO THE PEOPLE!

410
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,700
'GOOD COP'!

411
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,400
WE PATROLLED THEM.

412
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,200
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

413
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,300
HELLO OFFICER, LOOKS
LIKE I HAD A TIRE BLOW...

414
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,600
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE, HUH?

415
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,100
I GOT A SOLID SPARE, SO...

416
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,400

417
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,200
IN THE VEHICLE FOR THE MOMENT.

418
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,000
IS THERE A PROBLEM, OFFICER?

419
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,800
WELL, SIR...UH.

420

BUT YOU SEE MY PARTNER BACK THERE...?

00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,800

425
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,900
YEAH.

426
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,500
WELL...

427
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,800
WE GOT A COUPLE OF KILLERS
LOOSE...EVERYONE'S WOUND UP

428
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,500
PRETTY GOOD ABOUT IT BUT JACK THERE;

429
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,300
HE'S WOUND ESPECIALLY TIGHT.

430
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,600
UH, WE HEARD SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT ON THE RADIO...

431
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,000
OH NO NO, IT IS WORSE THAN
THEY'RE SAYING ON THE RADIO.

432
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,800
TRUST ME. AND JACK THERE

433
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,700
PRETTY WOUND UP AND WE SAW

434
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,100
AND HE SWEARS THAT YOU WERE
PULLIN' TOO MUCH SPEED...

435
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,800
OH, JEEZ, I WASN'T
SPEEDING, OFFICER, I, I,

436
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,700
REALLY I WAS GOING...NOT
SPEEDING...SIR...

437
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,400
NO. NO. NO. RELAX,
KEITH. THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

438
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,600
YOU'RE 'PREACHING TO THE
CHOIR'. THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

439
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,100
IT WAS JUST A NORMAL SPEED, I
WAS GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND HAD

440
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,800
A TIRE BLOW OUT, I'M NOT...

441
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,300
YEAH, I KNOW. I TOLD HIM. AN
D HE DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN I DID.

442
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,200
HERE HE COMES... ACT CASUAL.

443
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,700
GET DOWN ON THE FUCKING GROUND.

444
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,400
WHOA...UH...

447
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,800

448
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,100
OH. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA... MA'AM!

449
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,900
PLEASE RETURN TO THE VEHICLE.

450
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,100
KEITH, HONEY...?

451
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,100
(Keith) PLEASE DON'T SHOOT ME!

452
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,000
I'LL BE IN THE CAR, HONEY....

453
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,600
PLEASE OFFICERS!

454
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,200
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GET YOUR WALLET

455
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,800
AND GIVE IT TO MY PARTNER.

456
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,000
KEITH, IT'S BEST TO DO WHAT HE SAYS,

457
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,200
BECAUSE WHEN HE GETS LIKE
THIS...IT'S JUST REALLY CRUCIAL

458
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,000
THAT HE FEELS LIKE YOU'RE LISTENING.

459
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,900
I'M LISTENING.... PLEASE
DON'T SHOOT ME, OFFICER!

460
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,300
WE LET HIM GO WITH A WARNING...

461
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,000
(Gunshots)

462
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,800
YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE
GET OUT HERE, CAPTAIN...

463
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,800
YEAH.

464
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,600
THE WAY THEY START DRIVING
IN THE DESOLATE STRETCHES...

465
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,000
LIKE THE RACECAR DRIVERS
THEY ALWAYS WANTED TO BE.

466
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,600
SPEEDING IS THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE
OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES, YOU KNOW.

467
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,600
NOT THIS WEEK.

468
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,800
I'LL BE, UH, GETTIN' BACK TO IT NOW.

469
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,300
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT PLAN, WRIGHT.

470
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,200
YOU GETTIN' COFFEE?

471
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,300
LIGHT AND SWEET FOR ME, THERE, CHIEF.

472
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,900
SOMETHING I CAN DO FOR YOU, DEGRASSO?

473
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,900
JUST, UH, ENJOYING YOUR WORK.

474
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,800
HOW ABOUT YOU LET ME
ENJOY SOME OF YOURS?

475
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,600
GO ON...

476
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I THINK MAKING HIM ANGRY
IS A REALLY BAD IDEA.

477
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,900
OH, GEE MOM....TELL DAD
I'M REAL FUCKIN' SORRY.

478
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,700
HEY. AN ATTITUDE CHANGE, PLEASE?

479
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,900
IS THERE ANY MORE HOT CHOCOLATE?

480
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,500
UH, OF COURSE THERE
IS...CAN I KEEP THIS?

481
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,400
I DREW IT FOR YOU.

482
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,600
IT'S GREAT...

483
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,000
ALRIGHT, I'LL GO GET YOU
THA T HOT CHOCOLATE...

484
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,700
YOU'LL BE BE ALRIGHT, ON YOUR OWN?

485
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,800
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

486
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:59,900
¶¶

487
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,300

00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,500
IT'S ALMOST OVER.

821
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,500
STEPH JUST GOT OUT OF THE CAR!

822
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,100
OH SHIT!

823
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,800
GET BACK IN THE CAR, SIR!

824
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,900
MY MOM SAID YOU'D BE
GONE IN A FEW MINUTES.

825
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,900
WELL YEAH...IN A FEW MINUTES.

826
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,200
I TRIED TO TELL MY PARENTS
BUT THE MUSIC WAS TOO LOUD.

827
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,100
TRIED TO TELL THEM WHAT?

828
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,500
I SAW SOMETHING BAD...

829
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,700
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

830
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,500
THERE WAS A WHITE CAR AND A BLUE CAR.

831
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,000
AND THE BLUE CAR HAD SMASHED-UP
WINDOWS AND BLOOD ALL OVER IT.

832
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,700
YOU BEEN WATCHING SCARY MOVIES?

833
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,200
MY MOM DOESN'T LET ME.

834
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,900
ALRIGHT.

835
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,100
THANK YOU FOR TELLING

836
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,700

837
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,700
HOW ABOUT YOU AND ME
GO BACK TO YOUR CAR?

838
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,100
YOUR DAD LOOKS WORRIED.

839
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,200
I KNOW WHAT BLOOD LOOKS LIKE.

840
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,000
YOUR DAUGHTER'S A BRAVE LITTLE GIRL.

841
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,500
GOOD NEWS.

842
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,100
WE WON'T BE TICKETING YOU FOR SPEEDING.

843
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,300
ALRIGHT? I TOOK CARE OF THAT.

844
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,600
YOU KNOW, I COULD REPORT YOUR PARTNER.

845
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,700
BUT HE WON'T!

846
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,600
I WOULD JUST LET THIS GO,
SIR...WITH MY APOLOGIES.

847
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,000
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
SAID TO HIM BUT WHATEVER IT WAS

848
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,700
IT REALLY DID THE TRICK, BECAUSE
HE IS GRINNIN' LIKE A MONKEY!

849
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,600
YOU FOLKS GOT A GOOD SPARE IN THE TRUNK?

850
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:11,500

851
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,300
WE'LL BE JUST FINE.

852

SO THANK YOU FOR THAT, Y'KNOW,

00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,400
FUCKIN' ASSHOLE...

857
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:54,200
STEPH, HONEY...WHAT DID YOU

858
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,800
I TOLD THEM I SAW SOMETHING.

859
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,300
YOU WEREN'T LISTENING.

860
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,400
YOU COULD HAVE REALLY GOTTEN
YOUR FATHER IN TROUBLE...

861
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,900
HE'S NOT MY FATHER.

862
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,500
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

863
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,800

864
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,400
MOM, 'ARE WE THERE YET?'

865
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,200
ALRIGHT.

866
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,700
THIN ICE, DAVID.

YES...I DO...

869
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,700
STEPHANIE, WHERE IS YOUR FATHER?

870
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:39,400
WE SHOULD CONTACT HIM.

871
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,600
MY FATHER'S DEAD.

872
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,300
SOCCER MOM'S THIRSTY.

CHEERS!

HOW'S THE VACATION GOING?

880
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:20,100
I'M NOT REALLY HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME.

881
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,300

I AM SUIN' THEM...THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.

886
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,000
STEVEN, WE'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

887
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,100
THEY'RE ALL CORRUPT.

888
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,200
YEAH, NO, YEAH...

889
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,900
I MEAN, I WAS PETRIFIED!

890
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,300
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE
UNIFORM, OR THE GUN...

891
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,100
HEY MOM...MAYBE I'LL BE A COP.

892
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,100
DAVID, GROW UP!

893
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,600

900
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,200

THEY WERE RIGHT BEHIND US.

926
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,800

927
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:14,200
THE GIRL... TOLD US,

928
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,400
SHE SAID THERE WERE TWO CARS.

929
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,500
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

930
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,500
WE'RE MISSIN' THE WHITE ONE.

931
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,500
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO UH,
KEITH, OR 'CANDY PANTS'?

932
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,500
YOU'RE DESCRIBING THE
TAURUS THAT YOU PULLED OVER

933
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,500
EARLIER IN THE DAY?

934
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,500
UM, MY PARTNER AND I PULLED
THAT TAURUS OVER EARLIER, YES...

935
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,600
THEY WERE SPEEDING...BLEW A TIRE...

936
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:38,200
AND THEN YOU, THE TWO OF YOU,
LEFT THE SCENE WITH THE COUPLE

937
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,200
ALIVE AND WELL.

938
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:46,300
IS THAT YOUR STATEMENT?

939
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,200
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOIN', AGENT.

940
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,600
SO THEN IT WAS JUST
MOMENTS AFTER YOU LEFT

941
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,900
THAT THE UNKNOWN KILLERS
CAME AND TOOK ADVANTAGE

942
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,300
OF THE COUPLE'S PREDICAMENT?

943
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,200
FINE. THAT'S YOUR STATEMENT.

944
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,700
KEEP GOING.

945
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,200
HEY, IT'S HIS JOB TO SHAKE ALL OUR TREES

946
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:17,300

A VAN JUST PASSED US.

949
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,800
A WHITE VAN.

950
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:40,100
I DIDN'T WARN MY
STEPFATHER ABOUT THE VAN.

951
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,600
NO ONE BLAMES YOU, STEPHANIE.

952
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:53,000
I DON'T BLAME YOU.

953
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,900
EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM ON PURPOSE.

954
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,500
STEPHANIE, WHERE YA GOIN'?

955
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,800

00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,300

958
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,100

959
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,200

961
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,500
MOM!

962
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:11,000

(Female Hostage whimpers)

970
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,000
OH SHIT.

971
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,000

972
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,700

HOLD ON, I'LL BE, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

978
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,100
GET OFF THE VAN!

979
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,300
OKAY, ONE SECOND.

980
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,400
OKAY...

981
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,600

982
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,600

1169
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,400
LOOK, IF THERE'S ANY QUESTION

1277
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,700

1278
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,100
IT'S FUN NOW.

01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,200
OKAY?

1280

'CAUSE FIRST OF ALL,

NO.

UGH! JACK!

1296

I MAY HAVE ORCHESTRATED IT
BUT THEY WERE YOUR BULLETS.

1299
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:56,300
THIS IS KIND OF AMAZING.

HEY, NO, SHE'S IMPRESSED!

1302
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,400
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS IMPRESSED, TOO.
