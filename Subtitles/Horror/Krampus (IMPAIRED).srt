00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,609
every once in a while to
make sure that I'm not dead.

161
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,530
So, where's the nog?

162
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,409
I need to get merry.

163
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,760
Uh, It's in the kitchen.

164
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,001
Help yourself.

165
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,162
LINDA: Oh, Tom, let me
take that. I'm sorry.

166
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,287
TOM: That's okay.

167
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,805
Lord Almighty.

168
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,360
Looks like Martha Stewart
threw up in here.

169
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,648
HOWARD: We left the door open. Sorry about that.
TOM: No. No, no, no.

170
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,882
LINDA: We're
such a mess, honestly.

171
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,531
HOWARD: Six hours, I mean, come on.
Uh...

172
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,887
Sorry, wasn't
there another...

173
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,521
Mmm?

174
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,366
Child?

175
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,250
Chrissy! Darn it!

176
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,890
Jordan, I told you
to bring her inside!

177
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,401
Not my kid.

178
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,527
Come on, girls.

179
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,806
Tommy, help me
get the baby

180
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,211
and the rest of the girl
crap out of the truck.

181
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,441
Do you mind?
Thank you.

182
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,601
All right.

183
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,001
Let's make
some memories, huh?

184
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,044
Thank you, honey. Thank you.
Oh, my goodness.

185
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,248
A holiday roast
is a surprise.

186
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,731
Hemorrhoids are a surprise.

187
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,565
She is a goddamn nightmare.
What were you thinking?

188
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,848
Come on, she's not that bad. Oh.

189
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,081
She's not!

190
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,844
Besides, she
tricked me, okay?

191
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,490
I thought we were
just dropping off gifts,

192
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,085
and she came to the door
with a suitcase.

193
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,811
What was I supposed to do? Tell her she
has to spend Christmas by herself?

194
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,848
No, but at least you
could have warned me

195
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,571
when one of your mistakes
is gonna become my problem.

196
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,529
You think everything I do
is a mistake.

197
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,050
HOWARD: Sorry.
Look out. Look out.

198
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,321
Hey, honey.
Ooh. Oh.

199
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,004
I think this
warhead's armed.

200
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,849
Wow, you're so stinky.
(LAUGHS)

201
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,729
Okay, I'm gonna
go change her.

202
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,801
Let's go this way.

203
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,201
Just set that up wherever
you want, T. (SIGHS)

204
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,361
The whole truck
smells like shit.

205
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,405
So, what's for dinner?

206
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,201
(BURP5)

207
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,482
(HOWARD LAUGHING)

208
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,564
HOWARD: That's my boy!

209
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,971
That's my boy!

210
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,090
It sure is.

211
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,128
I'm getting Howie Junior
into game shape.

212
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,651
By the time he gets
to high school,

213
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,724
he's gonna be the biggest
lineman in the state.

214
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,283
Did you ever spend any time
on the field, Tommy?

215
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,647
No, actually, I didn't have
time in my younger years.

216
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,131
I was in training mostly.

217
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,326
HOWARD: What were you
training for? Uh...

218
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,884
Army? Marines?

219
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,726
It was the Eagle Scouts.

220
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,486
Eagle Scouts.

221
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,048
Now, Eagle Scouts, kids,

222
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,924
that's where you weave baskets

223
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,445
and help little old ladies
across the street. (LAUGHING)

224
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,244
Am I right?
No, no.

225
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,525
(CHUCKLES) No, no, no. It was actually
quite a bit of survival training.

226
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,481
So...

227
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,530
Well, the only survival training
I need is my ol' smoke pole,

228
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,769
and a big, fat
box of buckshot

229
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,569
that I keep out
in that truck.

230
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,531
A shepherd has got
to protect his flock.

231
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,282
Honey, we said no gun talk
at the dinner table.

232
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,244
This family needs
a little gun talk,

233
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,402
whether it's at the dinner
table, or anywhere else.

234
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,766
Wow. HOWARD: You know
what I'm saying?

235
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,922
SARAH: Looks like Chrissy's
really enjoying my gravlax.

236
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,725
(CHRISSY GIGGLING)

237
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,841
LINDA: Careful, kids.

238
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,251
Remember that
your Aunt Sarah likes

239
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,526
everything to be
clean and perfect,

240
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,206
and that's why she makes so much
food that you can't pronounce.

241
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,644
Well, I just thought you
guys might like a break

242
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,609
from macaroni and cheese
with hot dogs.

243
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,761
Yeah, okay.

244
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,565
Well, you were wrong.

245
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,041
And who doesn't make
a ham at Christmas?

246
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,049
What are you now, a Jew?

247
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,043
Maybe it's time
for dessert, hmm?

248
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,365
It's delicious, honey.

249
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,680
It's a little dry.

250
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,728
Okay. Well, mine's delicious.

251
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,487
(SIGHS)

252
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,210
Well,I guess I should've
gotten your bird.

253
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,486
You can just say
something nice.

254
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,767
HOWARD: I'll say it when she
gets back, if dessert's good.

255
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,365
TOM: Well, if you could
just do me a favor.

256
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,284
Tell him about Santa. TOM: Just
say something nice about dessert.

257
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,283
Hey, Maxi-Pad.

258
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,004
Hear what happened to Santa?

259
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
(SIGHS) No, Stevie.
What happened to Santa?

260
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,290
Heard it on the news.

261
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,362
His sleigh
crashed in the Rockies.

262
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,727
Shattered both his legs.

263
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,565
Frostbite took care of his
pain, but not his hunger.

264
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,242
So, to survive, he had to
slaughter and eat his reindeer.

265
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,211
Including Rudolph.

266
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,285
"Ate" tiny reindeer.
Get it? (CHUCKLES)

267
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,330
Knock it off!

268
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,004
Don't start anything.

269
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,565
Hey, guys, take it easy.

270
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,367
HOWARD: They're
just playing, Tommy.

271
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,645
Macaroni and cheese
and hot dogs.

272
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,848
Oh, Jesus.

273
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,766
So, what kind of godforsaken
concoction are you whipping up now?

274
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,447
You know how this fancy
food clogs my pipes.

275
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,886
Well, how about we
go to your trailer

276
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,291
for Christmas
next year, hmm?

277
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,242
And after you've spent weeks
decorating and cooking and cleaning,

278
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,084
I might just waddle in and
start bitching and moaning

279
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,650
about everything
you've worked so hard on.

280
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,166
Oh, Sarah, you know...

281
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,964
No, Aunt Dorothy, please.

282
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,451
For your sake,

283
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,564
just stay the hell
out of my kitchen.

284
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,881
You know, reindeer
are actually

285
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,889
a sustainable
food source

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,970
in the Northern Territories
and Alaska. Canada.

287
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,690
TOM: This time of year

288
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,846
we refer to reindeer as a
transportation system for Santa Claus.

289
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,930
We know you still believe
in the big, fat creeper.

290
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,004
I don't know what
you're talking about.

291
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,926
You sure about that?

292
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,125
Max, stop.

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,411

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,605
Oh, Maxi-Pad,
that's so sweet.

299
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,727
Give it back!

300
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,450
Stop, Max.

301
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,761
Blah, blah,
blah, bullshit, bullshit.

302
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,808
Ah. Here we go,
Maxi's wish list.

303
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,041
Stevie, stop.
That's enough.

304
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,804
Wait, you're up first, Beth.

305
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,481
"I wish me and Beth could
hang out like we used to.

I don't have tons of friends."

to stay calm and stay inside!

from the windows!

650
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,964

What?

655
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,361
Nothing.

656
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,766
It's just a scratch.

657
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,091
Oh, my God. it looks
like something bit you!

658

HOWARD: Nope.

659
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,847
Probably a bear trap
under the snow or something.

660

We don't have bears here.

Kids, why don't you
go into the kitchen

663
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,490
and get something
to eat now, okay?

664
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,369
You just don't wanna tell us
what's really going on here!

Everybody, in the kitchen right now, Max!
Okay? Right now.

keep an eye on them?

AUNT DOROTHY: Why me?

669
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,560
I never liked kids,
even when I was one.

670

Please.

671
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,921
Oh, all right. All right!

672
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,765
Come on, guys,
I'm gonna teach you

But don't you rat me out.

SARAH: But who
or what did all this?

HOWARD: Your guess
is as good as mine.

685
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,081
First I thought it was a gang
thing, (MEAT CLEAVER SWISHES)

686
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,600
but between this and all the
crazy stuff we saw out there,

687
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,205
it just doesn't add up.

688
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,243
LINDA: it could be

HOWARD: Yeah, terrorists.

690
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,091

And Beth?

695
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,844
Okay. She wasn't at Derek's, but
that doesn't mean anything.

696
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,081
She may have
found somewhere safe.

697
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,241
So, she's still out there.

698
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,169
Yes. And we will
find her, I promise.

699

I had to get Howard back...

HOWARD: Besides it being
sub-zero out there,

708
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,407
someone's tearing through
your fancy-ass neighborhood

Honey, sweetheart. Listen,
why don't we just leave?

Right? We can all
pile in the truck

713
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,966
and we'll just see
as far as we can get,

714
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,088

HOWARD: The truck's gone.

LINDA: What?

717
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,524
HOWARD: Yeah. And even if she wasn't,
the streets are totally screwed.

718
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,001
We can't go anywhere. It's too dangerous.
You got it?

719
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,964
Howard, how much ammo
do you have?

720
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,727
A couple shells still loaded,
maybe a dozen in my pocket.

721
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,131
Why?

722
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,329
I think our best bet
is to stay put.

723

Board up all
the doors and windows.

724

And as soon as the weather
breaks, we'll go find her.

725

gone to my brother's.

take Beth?

Are they coming for us?

00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,606
No. No, babies.
No, everything's fine.
