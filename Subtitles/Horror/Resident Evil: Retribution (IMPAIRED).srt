1
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:41,683
My name is Alice..

2
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:44,348
I worked for the Umbrella Corporation..

3
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:47,860
The largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world.

4
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:52,276
I was head of security at a secret
high tech facility called the Hive..

5
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:57,393
A giant underground laboratory
Developing experimental viral weaponry.

6
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:03,141
There was an incident, the virus escaped...

7
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,029
A lot of people died..

8
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:08,227
(Screams)

9
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:11,569
Trouble was.. they didn't stay dead.

10
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:19,619
The computer that controlled the Hive was a state of the art
artificial intelligence the Red Queen.

11
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,445
The Red Queen responded to the threat
Of the viral outbreak in an extreme way..

12
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:28,940
She went homicidal

13
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:31,535
(Red Queen)
You're all going to die down here.

14
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:36,060
The Red Queen attempted to kill everyone
Whether they were infected or not.

15
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,630
I managed to escape but this was only the beginning.

16
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,098
Viral outbreak spread like wildfire

17
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,858
First across the United States, then the world..

18
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,565
But the T virus didn't just bring the dead back to life..

19
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:02,263
It mutated them in terrifying ways.

20
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:10,150
Despite the apocalypse they had created the
Umbrella Corporation continued to experiment with the deadly virus

21
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:15,942
I was infected but the virus
Bonded with me on the cellular level..

22
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,730
I developed powers..

23
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:23,597
I became different..

24
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,643
Powerful..  Unstoppable..

25
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:34,006
As I got stronger the human race became weaker

26
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:40,713
I tried my best to lead what survivors I could find to safety,
But we were pursued relentlessly.

27
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:44,633
Even my friend Jill Valentine was
seized and brainwashed by Umbrella

28
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,125
Finally I confronted the head of the
Umbrella Corporation Albert Wesker..

29
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:55,443
He robbed me of my powers but
I still managed to defeat him.

30
00:05:56,658 --> 00:06:02,478
At last we thought it was over..
We thought we had survived the horror..

31
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:14,071
But we were wrong.. Once again we found ourselves fighting..
For our lives

32
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:50,482
(Alice screams)

33
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:24,180
Rise and shine,
C'mon babe we're late, The alarm didn't go off.

34
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:29,277
Becky's not up yet, Ms. Anderson is gonna be pissed.

35
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:33,193
You know how they get when we
drop her off late at the school.

36
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:43,815
Babe!?  You all right babe?

37
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:49,448
Yeah...  I'll go get Becky.

38
00:07:53,092 --> 00:07:55,810
I charged your batteries for you.
(Becky Signs "Thank you Dad")

39
00:07:58,088 --> 00:08:04,855
Becky?  You know Ms. Anderson,
She wants you to speak while you sign.

40
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:06,888
Thank you daddy.

41
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:12,000
(Whispers) When you come back from school
I have a surprise for you.

42
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,081
I heard that.

43
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,196
The way these batteries are lasting less
and less we'll need to get some new ones.

44
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:23,346
- OK well I can pick some up on my way home.
- I'm going to be late.. again.

45
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:28,741
- Ah Shit!
- I'll get you another shirt from the bedroom..

46
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:35,696
- Someone picked up your dry cleaning yesterday.
- You know you're my little angel don't you?

47
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:38,903
- You're going to be late remember?
- Oh.. yeah

48
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:40,631
(Slaps Rear)

49
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:43,829
I'll get you that shirt.

50
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,446
Get Becky back.. Ahhh!

51
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:51,022
No!!

52
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,190
Help!! Help Us!!

53
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:07,715
(Becky Screams)

54
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:16,095
C'mon!

00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:39,662
Go! Go!!

58

(Helicopter overhead, Sirens)

61
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,925
Wait!  Wait!!

62
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:04,680
What the hell is wrong with you?

63
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:07,425
C'mon get in the car!

64
00:11:14,315 --> 00:11:16,235
(Zombie Snarls, Alice Screams)

65
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,440
- What's going on?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

66
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:29,628
- Why are these people doing this?
- Those things are not people..

67
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:32,155
Not anymo.. (Crash)

(Car Alarms Blaring)

69
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:55,891
Are you hurt?

70
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:01,476
Can you move?  OK.

71
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:05,483
(Alice Grunts)

72
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:23,468

(Alice Groans)

- Project Alice why did you turn against Umbrella?
- Jill is that you?

80
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:18,527
- Project Alice why did you turn against Umbrella?
- What happened to Chris and Claire?

81
00:15:19,512 --> 00:15:21,132

(Alice Gasps)

103
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,848
Don't!

104
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,575
- My name is..
- Ada Wong operative for the Umbrella Corporation..

105
00:25:13,775 --> 00:25:18,460
One of Wesker's top agents..
I know exactly who and what you are..

106
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:24,000
Now the real question is.. 
why don't I just cancel your contract right now?

107
00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:29,095
I don't work for Umbrella anymore, 
and neither does Albert Wesker.

108
00:25:30,313 --> 00:25:35,000
- I don't care.
- You can kill her if you like but 
then you'll never know the truth

109
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:38,471
- Now be a good girl.
- Wesker!

110
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:41,153
Put down the knife. (Screen Shatters)

111
00:25:41,746 --> 00:25:44,186
Oh and Alice? 
How nice to see you again.

112
00:25:46,064 --> 00:25:49,194
- How did she get out?
- She's obviously getting help..

113
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:54,608
- We have a traitor in this facility.
- Security Systems were shut down for 2 minutes ma'am.

114
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:57,306
- What about control?
- We still can't raise them.

115
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:06,304
(Ada) I executed everyone in this control room, 
I enabled Wesker to hack the mainframe..

116
00:26:07,037 --> 00:26:10,859
We shut down the Security Systems, 
we let you out of that cell.

117
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,807
(Wesker) 
We have to get you out of this facility

118
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:19,872
- So why do you want to help me?
- We need you, the human race faces extinction..

119
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:23,912
Our only hope for survival is for us to work together.

120
00:26:24,567 --> 00:26:28,862
I'm not going anywhere until I know where we are
and what the hell is going on here.

121
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:33,137
- You're in the prime Umbrella testing facility. 
- Explain Tokyo?

122
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,985
What you saw was just a detailed recreation, 
nothing more

123
00:26:38,592 --> 00:26:42,180
It goes on for a few city blocks that's all.

124
00:26:43,147 --> 00:26:45,495
- I was outside.
- Were you?

125
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:48,575
- Saw the sky did you?
- It was night.

126
00:26:49,033 --> 00:26:56,018
- Stars? the Moon?
- The testing floor is 300 feet high, the ceiling black..

127
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,368
It's usually night in there, 
but isn't that when the monsters come out anyway?

128
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:08,250
- It was raining.
- Climate control, wind, rain, 
They can even make it snow if they want to

129
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:10,122
Why build such a place?

130
00:27:10,435 --> 00:27:15,985
Simple, the Umbrella Corporation derived 
It's primary income from the sale of viral weaponry..

131
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:19,280
Something that's impossible to test in the real world.

132
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:27,155
They recreated the center of New York, simulated an outbreak,
showed it to the Russians and sold them the virus..

133
00:27:27,818 --> 00:27:32,088
They simulated an outbreak in Moscow 
and sold it to the Americans

134
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:35,313
- An outbreak in Tokyo.
- Sold it to the Chinese.

135
00:27:35,783 --> 00:27:38,683
- An outbreak in China.
- Sold it to the Japanese.

136
00:27:38,938 --> 00:27:44,178
Exactly!  Everyone had to have it,
The Umbrella Corporation built a new arms race..

137
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:49,490
Only this time it was biological rather than nuclear.

138
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:56,790
Highly profitable, and this is where it all happened.
This is Umbrella's greatest creation.

139
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:02,038
- The belly of the beast.
- So why don't we just get the hell out of here?

140
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:11,875
Stop!  Sun up is in less than 1 minute,
Why don't you just see for yourself.

141
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:17,559
This facility is located in the straits of
Kamchatka, Northern Russia

142
00:28:18,384 --> 00:28:21,976
The old Soviet Union built submarine pens here in the 80s

143
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:29,869
After the Cold War ended the Umbrella Corporation
expanded them and built the testing floor.

144
00:28:33,614 --> 00:28:36,329
No one has ever escaped from this facility.

145
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:42,034
- Ice!
- You'll need all the help you can get..

146
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,494
So I've arranged for a strike team
to enter from the surface and assist you.

147
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:35,145
There they are, intake vents for the Umbrella facility.

148
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:41,538
- Looks abandoned.
- That's what they want you to think.

149
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,118
Let's move!  
We have just 2 hours to extract Alice and Ada..

150
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:49,131
After that we can expect heavy 
Umbrella reinforcements.

151
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:03,751
Running a bypass.

152
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:09,621
These are the access codes Ada gave us.

153
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:12,539
- You trust her?
- Just enter the numbers.

154
00:30:18,426 --> 00:30:23,281
- The charges are set.
- We're in!

155
00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:42,669
Let's go do this.

156
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:47,971
- They're in.
- The strike team has secured an elevator for your escape to the surface.

157
00:30:49,076 --> 00:30:53,801
They will eliminate Umbrella resistance, 
Then rendezvous with us and escort us out

158
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:59,434
- They have a friend of yours with them.. Luther West
- He's Alive?

159
00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:03,042
All right hold on ladies.

160
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:16,642
Synchronize watches, 2 hours exactly in..3..2..1..Mark!

161
00:31:24,103 --> 00:31:26,918
Leon why don't we just trigger the explosives remotely?

162
00:31:27,613 --> 00:31:33,480
Can't risk them jamming the signal, 
Whether we succeed or not this facility has to be destroyed.

163
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,520
- What if we take longer than 2 hours?
- Well then I hope you're really good at holding your breath.

164
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:47,616
Security Chief Valentine has reached the Tokyo 
test environment, she's tracking you.

165
00:31:48,588 --> 00:31:49,673
They're headed this way.

166
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:55,913
Her orders are to recapture you if possible, 
terminate you if necessary.

167
00:31:56,758 --> 00:31:59,456
- Who's giving these orders?
- The Red Queen.

168
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:04,851
- the computer?
- Yes the same artificial intelligence you encountered in the Hive.

169
00:32:05,874 --> 00:32:08,721
She now controls what remains 
of the Umbrella Corporation,

170
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:12,544
She will stop at nothing to prevent 
you escaping to the surface.

171
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:17,116
I've plotted an escape route for you..  
You'll cross the New York environment..

172
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:20,570
To suburbia where you'll rendezvous 
with the strike team..

173
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:25,201
They'll escort you through the 
Moscow environment to the submarine pens..

174
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:28,203
And take the elevator back to the surface.

175
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:33,473
The Red Queen has intercepted my signal, 
She's about to regain control of the facility..

176
00:32:33,998 --> 00:32:35,671
You must hurry, I can't...

177
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,957
Don't listen to the traitor Wesker, 
I am in control now.

178
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:46,132
Project Alice, Ada Wong stay where you are.

179
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:48,744
- Let's move
- Project Alice..

180
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:54,322
- You're all going to die down here!
- I've heard that before.

181
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:22,325
Defensive formation.. 
Lock your targets.. Fire at will.

182
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,940
Submarine pens are up ahead.

183
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:50,561
Barry, you and I take point.  
We rendezvous with Alice and Ada in 30 minutes.

184
00:33:57,798 --> 00:33:59,538
(Gunshots)

185
00:34:02,826 --> 00:34:06,114
(Gunshots)

186
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:08,891
Clear!

187
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:22,546
- (Whistles) now that's some hardware!
- Typhoon Class, Biggest nuclear subs the Soviets ever built.

188
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:26,644
Umbrella used them to secretly 
transport Bio weapons all over the globe.

189
00:34:27,549 --> 00:34:29,862
Let's pick up the pace, we have less than 90 minutes.

190
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:34,354
(Red Queen) 
Intruders detected, targeted for termination.

191
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:43,393
- New York.
- We need to cross two more test environments to escape.

192
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,993
- Let's move!
- Why would Umbrella continue to run these tests?

193
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:50,913
They want to study the biohazard, learn how to control it.

194
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:55,919
(Red Queen) 
Initialize New York sequence, Activate biohazard.

195
00:34:59,571 --> 00:35:06,041
(Computer) Standby! Standby!
New York sequence initialized!

196
00:35:06,806 --> 00:35:09,576
The Red Queen!  
She's activating bio weapons to stop us.

197
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:14,484
- Let's go!
- Wait!  You hear that?

198
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:21,869
(Axe Dragging)

199
00:35:23,982 --> 00:35:26,717
- You know what it is?
- I have an idea.

200
00:35:45,732 --> 00:35:47,485
You've got to be kidding me!

201
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:57,853
(Axemen Growl)

202
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:19,978
(Windshield Shatters, Ada Gasps)

203
00:36:43,706 --> 00:36:46,276
(Gasoline Sloshes)

204
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:22,189
Hey boys..

205
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:25,625
Bad idea!

206
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:40,190
(Car Alarm Blares)

207
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:48,583
Let's move!  We're behind schedule.

208
00:38:02,935 --> 00:38:08,318
- What's going on?
- It's the end of the sequence, 
They rarely last more than an hour.

209
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:13,223
C'mon.. Before the Red Queen activates something else

210
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:19,518
(Red Queen) Target survived,
Security Chief Valentine to intercept.

211
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:26,416
Intruders entering Moscow test environment,
Activate Los Plagos undead.

212
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:41,683
- What's going on?
- The Red Queen knows we're here, keep your eyes open.

213
00:38:42,645 --> 00:38:48,325
(Computer) Standby! Standby!
Moscow sequence initialized.

214
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:54,360
- What?
- Listen!

215
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:02,493
Right there!

216
00:39:11,313 --> 00:39:12,708
What the hell are those things?

217
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:20,526
Fall back!  Everyone fall back!

218
00:39:43,851 --> 00:39:49,059
- Clouds?
- They're not real, it's a holographic projection..

219
00:39:50,874 --> 00:39:55,502
When they were running a simulation 
Trust me no one was looking at the sky.

220
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:08,234
This is the rendezvous point,
the strike team is late, where are they?

221
00:40:10,337 --> 00:40:14,060
Someone is in the house behind you..
Upstairs window.

222
00:40:39,378 --> 00:40:40,635
Why would they be in here?

223
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:50,441
(Alice Huffs) 
They're using clones of me.

224
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:58,229
- Of course! You were one of the 50 basic models.
- (Alice Huffs) Basic Models.

225
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:02,277
How do you think Umbrella 
populates these test scenarios?

226
00:41:03,229 --> 00:41:06,292
Hundreds of people dead 
each time they run a simulation..

227
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:09,164
Umbrella imprints them with basic memories..

228
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:14,762
Just enough to ensure a correct emotional response
to the threat of the biohazard.

229
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:20,692
In one life she could be a suburban housewife,
the next a businesswoman in New York..

230
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:24,012
The next a soldier working for Umbrella.

231
00:41:25,622 --> 00:41:27,242
(Upper Floor Creaks)

232
00:42:31,322 --> 00:42:32,719
(Zombie Screeches)

233
00:42:44,922 --> 00:42:47,527
Mommy! I hid like you told me.

234
00:42:52,985 --> 00:42:55,187
What happened to your clothes
and your hair?

235
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:42,180
RPG.. Down!!

236
00:43:47,065 --> 00:43:47,982
We're running out of time..

237
00:43:48,932 --> 00:43:52,750
- You have to find as a way out now!
- Almost there!

238
00:44:12,145 --> 00:44:14,748
- None of this is real.
- It is to her.

239
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:20,271
I know that's the point. 
All these feelings she has for you, they were imprinted.

240
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:28,898
A day ago she was a blank slate,
I could show you a dozen just like her in cold storage.

241
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:32,796
I'm sorry, but it's true.

242
00:44:33,783 --> 00:44:39,084
- Ready! I was fast wasn't I?
- Yes you were.

243
00:45:07,834 --> 00:45:09,837
- Daddy?
- He's not your father.

244
00:45:10,427 --> 00:45:13,159
(Red Queen) 
Capture if possible, terminate if necessary.

245
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:18,537
- There's a child here.
- Your problem, not ours.

246
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:23,957
- All heart, you haven't changed a bit.
- I don't know you lady.

247
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:28,335
Now, surrender or die.

248
00:45:41,952 --> 00:45:43,032
Get down!

249
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:29,081
Advance, B Team!

250
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:40,821
You can't stay here, 
This will show you the way out..

251
00:46:41,841 --> 00:46:48,381
Go through Moscow to the submarine pens, take this,
The less I have with me the better.

252
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:52,215
Alpha team forward!

253
00:47:14,423 --> 00:47:16,685
They're coming we have to hurry, Go!

254
00:48:00,274 --> 00:48:01,941
(Leon's Gun Jams)

255
00:48:07,686 --> 00:48:09,367
I got it, this way!

256
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:22,002
- Hey!
- Wait she helped us, don't you remember?

257
00:48:23,642 --> 00:48:28,484
You two made it..
I thought I was the only one that survived.

258
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:31,082
What is this place and why is everything in Russian?

259
00:48:32,272 --> 00:48:34,252
And what's with the S&M Getup?

260
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:39,620
- You know how to use this? 
- I campaigned for gun control.

261
00:48:42,395 --> 00:48:45,125
No I don't think you understand, 
I marched against the NRA.

262
00:48:45,605 --> 00:48:51,397
Concentrate.. 
It's just like a camera, point and shoot.

263
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:58,653
Congratulations you're officially a bad ass!

264
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:03,488
(Loud Banging)
What the hell's going on here?

265
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:07,213
I'll explain when I get back, 
Right now you have to keep her safe.

266
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:11,226
- You stay with her.
- You're going? You said you wouldn't leave.

267
00:49:12,086 --> 00:49:15,813
Trust me OK?  What I say is true.. 
I'll come back for you.

268
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:18,523
- You promise?
- Trust me.

269
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:25,867
I love you.

270
00:49:29,907 --> 00:49:33,347
Come on, she'll be back for you.
Gotta find a hiding place.

271
00:49:34,587 --> 00:49:38,040
I met your sister,
She's not very nice.

272
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:41,385
Let's try hiding down here.

273
00:49:53,968 --> 00:49:55,296
- This way!
- Let's move!

274
00:49:57,398 --> 00:49:59,961
We can work our way around the... (Screams)

275
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:27,526
Waiting for a written invitation?

276
00:50:30,392 --> 00:50:33,029
(Tires Squeal)

277
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:41,249
- Sweet ride!
- Well this is Moscow.

278
00:50:42,534 --> 00:50:44,654
I heard gunfire, 
Thought you might need some help.

279
00:50:45,217 --> 00:50:49,814
- Where's Ada?
- I don't think she made it, I'm sorry.

280
00:50:50,894 --> 00:50:52,982
- You saw her die?
- No.

281
00:50:54,512 --> 00:50:55,759
She always has a plan.

282
00:51:35,188 --> 00:51:36,993
Boys? You mind?

283
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,765
- Shall we?
- My pleasure.

284
00:52:07,196 --> 00:52:08,164
(Luther Yells)

285
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:13,089
Let me know when you plan on doing that again.

286
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:20,424
Heads up!

287
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,437
(Alice Gasps)

288
00:52:56,737 --> 00:52:58,302
Our little friend is back!

289
00:52:59,752 --> 00:53:00,657
Oh Shit!

290
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:08,235
- Almost there.
- What are you going to do?

291
00:53:42,698 --> 00:53:47,006
(Car Sizzles and Sputters)

292
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:54,481
- Is everyone OK?
- Yeah.

293
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,366
OK let's go.

294
00:53:59,126 --> 00:54:04,506
Hello? You can come out! I'm back!

295
00:54:10,609 --> 00:54:12,246
Where'd you find these guys?

296
00:54:13,919 --> 00:54:16,599
- Who's this?
- I'm Becky.

297
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,901
- Hi Becky.
- This is my mom.

298
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:24,739
- Your mom? Oh!
- Long story.

299
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:28,014
22 minutes left.

300
00:54:29,022 --> 00:54:32,414
- There's no going back the way we came.
- Yeah and we lost our map with Sergei.

301
00:54:32,929 --> 00:54:34,024
I'm on it!

302
00:54:47,508 --> 00:54:51,846
We can take this tunnel at the end there's a service shaft 
That leads down to the submarine pens.

(Rubble Moves)

305
00:55:19,337 --> 00:55:24,482
- How'd you end up working for Wesker?
- I don't work for him, things on the surface have changed.

306
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:29,604
Wesker said you knew of some weapon, 
Something I could turn the tide for us

307
00:55:32,054 --> 00:55:34,077
But I don't think I would've risked so much 
for one person.

308
00:55:35,822 --> 00:55:37,510
You're probably right.

309
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:42,505
This way!
The submarine pens are up above us.

310
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:44,707
C'mon move!

311
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:10,068
- The elevator platforms are up ahead.
- 11 minutes, we're gonna be OK.

312
00:56:13,973 --> 00:56:20,755
- 11 minutes, we're gonna be OK.
- (Red Queen) Accessing power grid, dispatching biohazard.

Everybody get onboard!

00:56:32,491 --> 00:56:36,388
Hold on! 
Next stop menswear and sporting goods.

315
00:56:44,563 --> 00:56:45,731
Get down!

- Barry what is it?
- I don't know.

317
00:56:49,872 --> 00:56:52,054
- Where are you going?
- Somebody must have cut the power remotely.

318
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:59,064
Be strong, 
I'm gonna keep you safe.

319
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:12,152
- Can you get it back online?
- Not without the access codes.

320
00:57:15,955 --> 00:57:18,907
9 minutes.. 
Looks like we're going with plan B.

321
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,120
- What?
- There's a reason we planted those explosives.

322
00:57:24,259 --> 00:57:26,189
(Squishing)

323
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:33,666

325
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:43,056

326

(Barry Spits)
I feel like shit.

327
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,549
She's dead!

328
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,510
- What are you doing?
- She's alive, I'm going to get her.

329
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:14,030
- I didn't lose this many friends so you could just walk away.
- I plan on coming back.

330
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:18,690
Don't do this, you're more important than she is.

331
00:58:19,657 --> 00:58:22,455
- That's where you're wrong.
- This is a mistake.

332
00:58:23,248 --> 00:58:24,640
Get out of my way.

333
00:58:34,873 --> 00:58:38,083
- Don't leave without me OK?
- Are you kidding? I'm going with you.

334
00:58:46,163 --> 00:58:50,548
- Don't move, don't move.
- It's OK, go get her back.

335
00:59:19,281 --> 00:59:21,311
You like that, Huh?

336
01:00:58,779 --> 01:01:00,061
Fall back!

337
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:13,879
- Fall back to the elevator!
- You go, I'm gonna stay here awhile.

338
01:01:14,709 --> 01:01:19,516
- Barry!
- When the countdown gets to zero you have to be on that elevator.

339
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:29,369
Someone's gotta stay here Leon..
Besides I'm kind of enjoying myself.

340

Bring out the prisoner!

347
01:03:58,737 --> 01:04:01,999
Cease your firing or I'll execute her.

348
01:04:05,254 --> 01:04:08,722
Now, put down your guns and step out.

349
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,010
Step out or she dies.

- Becky are you hurt?
- No I'm OK.

361
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:41,126
Told you she'd have a plan.

- I'm gonna kill you.
- Perhaps..

388

But first you have work to do.
