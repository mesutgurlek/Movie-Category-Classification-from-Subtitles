SIR CHARLES: I see.

328
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:35,122
One thing's for certain,
an Englishman didn't do it.

329
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:41,728
Maybe one of these Red Indians...

330
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:46,689
...wandered into Whitechapel
and indulged his natural inclinations.

331
00:25:48,373 --> 00:25:50,443
With all due respect, sir...

332
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:54,851
...I believe this was done by someone with
at least a working knowledge of dissection.

333
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:58,642
-An educated man, such as a doctor...
-An educated man? That's preposterous.

334
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:00,809
No well-bred man would do this.

335
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,288
Probably a tradesman or a butcher.

336
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:08,006
A tradesman is a possibility, sir.

337
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,725
But there's a strong indication against it.

338
00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:14,362
There was a sprig of grapes
under her body.

339
00:26:14,453 --> 00:26:16,284
What are you driving at?

340
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:21,168
No one in Whitechapel, no matter
what their trade, could afford grapes.

341
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,642
Obviously,
they were given to her by the killer.

342
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:26,851
It follows that he must be
someone with money.

343
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:30,365
What about the Jews? A Jew butcher?

344
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:34,851
Or a Jew tailor might have money.
Plenty of them in Whitechapel.

345
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:38,085
Sir, for the sake of public safety
in general...

346
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:42,048
...l'd like to be careful about spreading
the rumor it might be a Jew.

347
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:48,087
I know your reputation for making guesses
that turn out to be right.

Frankly, it doesn't matter to me
what your methods are.

350
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:59,445
But be certain you don't proceed
without proof. Is that clear?

351
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:00,892
Of course, sir.

352
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:05,126
Personally, I don't care. The fewer
pinch-pricks on the streets, the better.

353
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:09,288
But the sooner you find this butcher
or tailor...

354
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:12,803
...the sooner we can all celebrate
your promotion.

00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:35,284
NETLEY: Just the usual, I expect.

485
00:38:36,893 --> 00:38:38,963
This alley takes you to the yard.

486
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:42,972
My gentleman is quiet.
He doesn't like disturbances.

487
00:38:43,733 --> 00:38:47,487
What I want to know is, a toff like him...

488
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:49,689
...how much is he offering?

489
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:52,924
NETLEY: Here, £2 for now.

490
00:38:53,253 --> 00:38:55,005
That'll do me.

491
00:38:55,173 --> 00:38:56,686
Let me see you.

492
00:38:58,013 --> 00:39:01,528
ANNIE: Down there?
NETLEY: Straight to the door at the end.

493
00:39:06,373 --> 00:39:08,170
ANNIE: Straight down there, right?

BEST: Any more information?
My readers want to know.

506
00:39:44,853 --> 00:39:48,084
Is it true you found a piece
of leather apron in her mouth?

507
00:39:48,293 --> 00:39:53,162
No. But if it's your fancy, I'd be delighted
to stuff your mouth with leather.

508
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:57,569
BEST: Give us a tidbit, Sergeant.
We'll put your picture on the front page.

509
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:01,887
WOMAN: Do something about this.
This is ridiculous.

510

on the loose. What about my wife?

[Eerie instrumental music]

GODLEY: Yes.
Another of the circle of friends.

514
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:43,771
Annie Chapman.

515
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:48,245
Dark Annie, they called her.
You still say this isn't the Nichols boys?

516
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:53,883
Did the constable show you the bit
of leather found by the waterspout?

517
00:40:53,973 --> 00:40:56,282
Could be part of a butcher's apron.

518
00:40:56,853 --> 00:41:01,290
Leather apron. Dear God,
we could be looking for a butcher after all.

519
00:41:02,053 --> 00:41:03,281
I saw her.

520
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:06,485
-This one?
-Yeah, last night.

521

[Muffled laughter]

522
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,091
I saw her face.

POLICEMAN: Don't trample over this area.
WOMAN: Let us see the body!

WOMAN: Come on, let us see.
GODLEY: Oh, God.

525
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,325
There's your typical Londoner...

526
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:26,849
...imbued with the Christian spirit
of sympathy for his fellow man.

527
00:41:26,973 --> 00:41:29,043
Or fellow whore, in this case.

528
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:31,209
He's really outdone himself this time.

529
00:41:31,293 --> 00:41:33,170
He not only severed the intestines...

530
00:41:33,253 --> 00:41:36,802
...he's carefully arranged them
around the neck and shoulders.

531
00:41:36,973 --> 00:41:39,043
I think he's taken more organs this time.

532
00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:47,447
Grapes again. Why grapes?

533
00:41:48,613 --> 00:41:51,446
Only Polly and Dark Annie
were given grapes.

534
00:41:51,853 --> 00:41:54,731
Only they were disemboweled
in such a meticulous fashion.

535
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,483
This ain't killing for profit.

536
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,571
This is ritual.

537
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,371
Yeah, but why grapes?

538
00:42:11,453 --> 00:42:14,092
So they'll trust whatever he offers.

539
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:26,008
I've never fully understood that tradition.

540
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:27,732
They're for the ferryman.

541
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:32,241
The ferryman who takes the body
across the river into the land of the dead.

542
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,642
If she don't have the money to pay him...

543
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:38,687
...she'd have to wander,
forever lost between the two worlds.

544
00:42:46,093 --> 00:42:48,084
I need to consult a doctor.

545
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:49,885
Are you ill, Inspector?

546
00:42:50,373 --> 00:42:52,125
A surgeon, to be specific.

547
00:42:52,573 --> 00:42:55,690
The killer removed
the victim's uterus and its attachments.

548
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,567
My God. He's out of his mind.

549
00:42:59,093 --> 00:43:01,163
That's very astute of you, sir.

550
00:43:01,293 --> 00:43:04,171
I don't appreciate sarcasm, Inspector.

551
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:06,369
FREDERICK: I'm sorry, sir.
I meant nothing by it.

552
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:09,166
You already have a surgeon
at your disposal.

553
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,729
I need a man with a strong stomach
and a sober mind.

554
00:43:13,053 --> 00:43:14,805
The police surgeon has neither.

555
00:43:15,413 --> 00:43:17,608
SIR CHARLES: No. Request denied.
FREDERICK: Why?

556
00:43:17,813 --> 00:43:19,610
Are you questioning my decision?

557
00:43:19,733 --> 00:43:21,530
No, sir. I simply want to know why.

558
00:43:21,613 --> 00:43:24,650
There's already too much nonsense
and gossip in the press.

559
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:29,165
You start consulting doctors, and
all sorts of wild notions will be printed.

560
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,807
No one else is to see the bodies.

561
00:43:33,533 --> 00:43:34,966
DOCTOR #1: It is my honor...

562
00:43:35,173 --> 00:43:39,644
...to present this unique
medical phenomenon.

563
00:43:40,613 --> 00:43:43,764
Until last week, Mr. Joseph Merrick...

564

DOCTOR #2: John Merrick.

565
00:43:45,093 --> 00:43:46,606
I beg your pardon.

566
00:43:46,693 --> 00:43:51,608
Mr. John Merrick was an attraction
at a side show.

567
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:57,170
Now he's being cared for
at England's leading hospital.

568
00:43:57,493 --> 00:44:02,487
With your generosity,
we will be able to continue to do so.

FERRAL: ...a psychotic patient.

581
00:45:04,853 --> 00:45:06,809
Pardon me, sir. Are you Dr. Ferral?

582
00:45:06,893 --> 00:45:07,882
I am.

583
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:11,042
I'm Inspector Abberline,
assigned to Whitechapel.

584
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:13,813
Oh, my Lord! You're the Ripper case.

585
00:45:13,933 --> 00:45:15,571
-Am I right?
-Yeah.

586
00:45:15,693 --> 00:45:16,887
Jolly good.

587
00:45:17,173 --> 00:45:20,848
You've come to the perfect place.
We've got butchers aplenty here.

588
00:45:21,493 --> 00:45:22,482
I see.

589
00:45:22,573 --> 00:45:26,248
I could certainly use your expertise
to help solve this case.

590
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:29,212
They tell me you're
the best young surgeon in London.

591
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,282
FERRAL: Really?

592
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:35,245
I don't see how a reputable surgeon
could know anything about it.

593
00:45:35,813 --> 00:45:39,283
This country's overrun
with foreigners, Orientals.

594
00:45:40,093 --> 00:45:41,731
Jews.

595
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:46,012
Socialists trying to stir things up
against our monarchy.

596
00:45:46,733 --> 00:45:50,248
That's who you should be pursuing,
don't you think?

597
00:45:50,973 --> 00:45:54,443
Excuse me.
You don't belong here, do you?

598
00:45:55,773 --> 00:45:56,444
[Match striking]

599
00:45:56,533 --> 00:46:00,128
SIR WILLIAM: I'm afraid Dr. Ferral suffers
from the surgeon's malady.

600
00:46:01,253 --> 00:46:02,891
FREDERICK: What's that, sir?

601
00:46:03,653 --> 00:46:05,006
Want of feeling.

602
00:46:05,493 --> 00:46:09,486
He knows everything about anatomy
and nothing about the soul.

603
00:46:10,573 --> 00:46:12,484
How may I assist you, Inspector?

604
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:14,723
Forgive my ignorance, but...

605
00:46:15,253 --> 00:46:16,811
...are you a surgeon?

606
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:18,207
I was.

607
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:22,083
Unfortunately,
I suffered a brain seizure six months ago.

608
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:27,162
-I'm sorry to hear that, sir.
-These days, I limit myself to teaching.

609
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:32,204
So you see, I'm accustomed to
answering questions, Inspector.

610
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:39,127
FREDERICK: Could you tell me
what sort of a knife this would be?

611
00:46:45,533 --> 00:46:46,522
[Chuckles]

612
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:49,491
I think you mean to draw a Liston knife.

613
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:52,970
It's named for Liston,
who was a surgeon in the Crimean War.

614
00:46:53,133 --> 00:46:55,693
Because there was
no anesthetic on the battlefield...

615
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:59,249
...he had to carry out
his amputations very quickly.

616
00:47:00,013 --> 00:47:03,130
Do you, by any chance,
have the police surgeon's report available?

617
00:47:03,493 --> 00:47:05,802
FREDERICK: Yes, I do, sir.
SIR WILLIAM: May I?

618
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,689
FREDERICK:
You must keep this confidential.

619
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:10,126
SIR WILLIAM: Of course.

620
00:47:12,813 --> 00:47:14,371
Thank you.

621
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:27,887
[Coughs]

622
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,647
Wouldn't someone
have heard their screams?

623
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:32,405
Not if he cut their throats first.

624
00:47:33,613 --> 00:47:34,602
Yes.

625
00:47:35,693 --> 00:47:39,322
How can you be sure they wouldn't
react to seeing the Liston knife?

626
00:47:39,893 --> 00:47:41,008
Grapes.

627
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,011
He offers them grapes first.

628
00:47:45,973 --> 00:47:49,443
-Grapes are very tempting.
-They'd gobble them up.

629
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,605
He might offer them a drink
to ease them down.

630
00:47:52,733 --> 00:47:54,610
A drink laced with laudanum.

631
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,925
SIR WILLIAM: How do you know that?

632
00:47:58,053 --> 00:48:00,726
I found a sprig of grapes
on both victims' bodies.

633
00:48:00,813 --> 00:48:03,008
And I smelled the laudanum on their lips.

634
00:48:03,293 --> 00:48:06,603
Laudanum is a derivative of opium.

635
00:48:06,853 --> 00:48:10,368
Apart from doctors and addicts,
not many would recognize it.

636
00:48:14,213 --> 00:48:17,205
How long have you
chased the dragon, Inspector?

637
00:48:21,813 --> 00:48:24,088
SIR WILLIAM: These should help
with the headaches.

638
00:48:26,693 --> 00:48:31,050
Opium leaches minerals out of the body,
so I've also given you a tonic.

639
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:33,563
That'll help to restore your appetite.

640
00:48:34,293 --> 00:48:36,363
Thank you very much, sir.

641
00:48:39,053 --> 00:48:42,568
-I'm a fool.

He cut their throats from left to right.

648
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:04,848
He had to slice through
four layers of tissue...

00:49:05,093 --> 00:49:07,288
...and up to an inch of subcutaneous fat.

After that...

651
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:14,284
...he entered the abdominal cavity, so he
would've used more than the Liston knife.

is an educated man?

MAN'S VOICE:
You were describing the human heart.

1270
01:39:03,972 --> 01:39:04,961
Yes.

1271
01:39:07,172 --> 01:39:08,161
Yes.

1272

The human heart...

1273
01:39:12,452 --> 01:39:14,841
...is a dense and powerful muscle...

1274
01:39:16,452 --> 01:39:19,330
...much like the organic equivalent
of mahogany...

1275
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:24,963
...and notoriously difficult to burn.

1276
01:39:28,652 --> 01:39:30,404
It's about the size of a fist.

1277
01:39:32,292 --> 01:39:35,523
It provides the motor power
for the circulatory system.

The heart contains two atria,
two ventricles and four valves.

It is, in effect, a single pump...

1281
01:39:52,332 --> 01:39:56,803
In the adult, the heart rate averages
70 to 80 beats a minute.

Such is the force of the heart beat...

1283
01:40:03,052 --> 01:40:09,605
...that if the body's largest artery,
the aorta, is severed...

1284
01:40:09,692 --> 01:40:12,764
...a six-foot jet of blood...

1285
01:40:14,132 --> 01:40:16,123
...is released.
