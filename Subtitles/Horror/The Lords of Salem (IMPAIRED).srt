00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,888

during the Salem witch trials?

239
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,571
Well, approximately 25,

240
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,924
if you include the accused witches
that died in prison.

Come on, 25? Are you serious?

I mean, I have to admit
I'm a bit disappointed with the number.

243
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,606
Were there any quote, unquote,
"real witches" in Salem?

244
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,606
Well, today there's a large

312

You look exhausted.

Ah, thanks. You make me feel so pretty.

OK.

Oh, please come on in

331

We'll be waiting.

332
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,683
Troy. Come here, Troy.

333
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,564
I know, buddy, I'm late. I'm sorry.

334
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,887
I'm sorry. OK, hold on one second.

335

Here we go. Come here. That's it.

336
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,002
There you go.

337
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,929
OK, I promise I'll be back quick.

338
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,250
I'm just gonna go have a quick one
with the ladies downstairs. Be back soon.

339
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,764
That should do it.
Another dead soldier.

340
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,329
You served your country well, sir.

341
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,249
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear. Cheers.

342
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,124
So what do you gals do?

343
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,402
I'm a self-help guru.

344
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,364
I help people who are lost,
find themselves again.

345
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,370
Ah. I think I could use some of that.

346
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,562
We all could, baby.

347
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,331
- And Megan here...
- I read, darling.

348
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,000
Read? I'm not sure I understand.
Like a proofreader?

349
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,925
Megan is a very good palm reader.

350
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,166
Oh.

351
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,968
See, most readings
are like surface observations,

352
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,007
but Megan sees things really deeply,
into the world beyond.

353
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,206
Really? I've never had my palm read before.

354
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,800
I always thought it was kind of a scam.
No offence.

355
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,323
Oh, well, actually, my dear,
I do take offence, great offence.

356
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,128
Plastic Gypsies with crystal balls
and neon signs

357
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,811
have destroyed the value of my gift.

358
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,645
Give her your hand.

359
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,328
The hand and the brain are one.

360
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,161
One quarter of the motor cortex
in the human brain

361
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,806
is devoted to the hand.

362
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,764
- Did you know that?
- No.

363
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,091
The lines are formed
at a subatomic and cellular level.

364
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,010
These are the lines of your life.

365
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,441
Let me see your right hand.

366
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,528
The right hand is the future.

367
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,642
Ah. ls that the life line?

368
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,128
This is the line of fate.

369
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,971
This is the only line of concern to me.

370
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,004
The length of your life
is inconsequential.

371
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,761
It's what you do with your time
that matters.

372
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,929
Ah. OK, well...
So, tell me, what is my destiny?

373
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,811
It reads your fate, not your destiny.

374
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,410
Is there a difference?

375
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,161
With destiny
you can premeditate the outcome,

376
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,491
but fate, fate leaves you no choice.

377
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,162
It is predetermined
by forces stronger than ourselves.

378
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,762
Oh. I don't like that. I think
I changed my mind. I don't wanna know.

379
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,680
You must make peace
with your subconscious desires.

380
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,842
Really? What desires?

381
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,362
The wicked thoughts
burning inside your head

382
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,404
and exploding
in the juices between your legs.

383
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,609
The darkness within your very soul.

384
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,889
The only reason you exist.

385
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,046
Uh, I think I'll make peace
with those desires later.

386
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,049
I really should be getting upstairs now.

387
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,323
Heidi, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.

388
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,728
Megan can be a little adamant,
you know, sometimes about these things.

389
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,922
Yeah, and a little wasted.

390
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,567
I'm really embarrassed.
This is not the evening I had planned.

391
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,331
No, it's fine. Have a good night.

392
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,963
- Good night.
- Good night.

393
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,607
- Well, have another drink.
- I think that went rather well.

394
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,651
Why do you have to get so intense
when you do these readings?

395

that there is a war waging in heaven.

Well, maybe, but I'm just trying
to track something right now.

544
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,721
So, what can I do you for?

545
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,811
Well, um, couple of days ago
I was at this radio station,

546
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,450
I was hawking my book,

547
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:54,487
and I heard this music
by a group called the Lords of Salem.

548
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,968
And I thought that this group and this music
seemed a little odd,

549
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,243
so I did a little research, blah, blah, blah,
and found it in your book.

550
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,850
Let me guess. The diary
of the Reverend Jon Hawthorne, right?

551
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,807
Yeah. I was wondering if by any chance
you have the complete diary or...?

552
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,964
No, no, no, but I did read it in depth.

553
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,048
And do you remember anything of interest?

554
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,767
Well, basically Hawthorne was obsessed

555
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:27,530
with, in his words, "the master witch"
Margaret Morgan and her coven of six,

556
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,881
whom he dubbed the Lords of Salem.

557
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,611
Why do you think he was obsessed
with this particular coven?

558
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,248
Oh, he thought they were hiding out
in the woods around Salem

559
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,124
making the devil's music

560
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,802
for the purpose of possessing the souls
of the Salem women.

561
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,163
Yeah, well, I gathered that
from the few pages that I read,

562
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,446
that he and his group
eventually killed Morgan and the coven.

563
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:55,086
- Right.
- That's where the pages end.

564
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,727
So I was wondering if there's
any other light you could shed on this?

565
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,730
Well, yeah, actually, yeah.

566
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,363
Let's not forget
the curse of Margaret Morgan.

567
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,609
- What curse?
- Oh, God.

568
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,610
The curse section. That's the best part.

569
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,969
This is where the diary gets so bizarro.

570
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,801
The final sections of the diary just...

571
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,890
Well, I mean,
it's complete rambling nonsense, right?

572
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,889
- Let's hear it.
- OK.

573
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,289
Well, apparently during the execution,

574
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:34,725
while the coven and Margaret Morgan
were being roasted alive,

575
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:38,049
Margaret Morgan put a curse
on the females of Salem.

576
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,888
Something about the forever deaths
of the daughters' daughters

577
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,721
and other crazy stuff like that.

578
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:50,128
Also she called Hawthorne's bloodline

579
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,280
"the vessel by which the devil's child
would inherit the earth".

580
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,241
