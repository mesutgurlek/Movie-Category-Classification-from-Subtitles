Look, I have to strip
and clean them anyway.

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:07,853
You still want to learn?

5
00:00:07,996 --> 00:00:10,107
There's one other item.
I wrote it down separately.

6
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,224
It's personal. If we could be
real discreet.

7
00:00:12,656 --> 00:00:15,525
- You're pregnant.
- You can't tell anybody, okay?

8
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:17,529
- Walker!
- Andrea! Don't!

It's my job.

16

No, it's not.
You're a housewife.

17
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:48,622
Yeah, punk?

18
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,414
You see my house around here?

19
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,038

She might be somewhere else.

23
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:06,224
Maybe she got eaten.

24

00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,612
Here, enjoy.

36
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:38,549
Are you trying to buy
my silence with fruit?

37
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,406
Of course not.
There's also jerky.

38
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,298
Will you please tell me why your dad
has a secret barn full of walkers?

39
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,037
- It's creepy.
- Shh.

40
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:47,661
- You know that, right?
- Shh.

41
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,383
Just trust me on this, okay?

42
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,434
But I suck at lying.

43
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:53,667
I can't even play poker.
It's too much like lying.

44

You have to keep this
to yourself.

You have to. Please.

Dale, here's some
peaches for you.

47
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,318
Mm, thank you.

48

Nothing's up.
Why?

51
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:33,286
Andrea:
Hey.

52
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:36,419
This is not that great, but...

53
00:04:40,142 --> 00:04:42,353
What, no pictures?

54
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,881
I'm so sorry.
I feel like shit.

55
00:04:44,915 --> 00:04:47,012
Yeah, you and me both.

but if there's
anything I can do...

58
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:53,492
You were trying
to protect the group.

59
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:55,429
We're good.

60
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:02,232
But hey,

61
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:05,419
shoot me again,
and you'd best pray I'm dead.

62
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:14,460
What did Rick say?

63
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,743
You didn't tell him?

64
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:19,751
Okay.

65
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,461
But you have to.

66
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:23,613
You're pregnant.

67
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:26,760
You need vitamins, medicine,
a nice pillow.

68
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,144
Here.

69
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:33,018
You can have my share.

70
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,268
Honey, I don't want
your food, okay? Eat.

71
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,184
You need to eat.
You're too skinny.

72
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:41,848
And if you're not gonna let Rick take
care of you, then someone has to.

73
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:46,057
Lori, you have
a medical condition.

74
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:51,996
I'll make another run into town.
Just tell me what you need.

75
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:54,503
I need you to be quiet
about this.

76
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:56,810
All right? Please.

77

<i>( Shane whistles )
Hey! Peach man.</i>

78
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:09,965
The creek flows South, past
that farmhouse Daryl found.

79
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,645
Maybe Sophia dropped
the doll there,

80
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,201
the current
brought it downstream.

81
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,611
Yeah.
What's up that way?

82
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:15,600
A housing development.

83
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,269
It went in maybe 10 years ago.

84
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:18,905
Take a run up there
after gun practice.

85
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:21,371
I'll hold down the fort here,
but take backup.

86
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:23,317
After what went down
with Daryl,

87
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:25,664
I don't want anyone going out alone.
We stay in pairs.

88
00:06:25,714 --> 00:06:27,388
I'll take suggestions
on a partner.

89
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,504
See how they do on the range,
then take your pick.

90
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:36,252
Thanks.

91
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:47,525
My binoculars.

92
00:06:47,564 --> 00:06:49,814
Yeah yeah.

93
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:56,471
Okay, bye.

94
00:07:00,205 --> 00:07:03,110
We'd like to join you
for gun training today.

95
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,797
Hershel's been very clear.

96
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:07,277
I can't involve any of you in
what we do without his okay.

97
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,784
He doesn't like it,
but he consented.

98
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:12,958
Otis was the only one
who knew guns.

99
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:14,551
Now that he's gone,

100
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,554
we gotta learn
to protect ourselves.

101
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:18,754
<i>Her father saw
the sense in that.</i>

102
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,332
No offense, but I'll ask
Hershel myself.

103
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,784
Dude, nice lid, man.

104
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:28,259
What's going on?

105
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:32,067
I want to learn to shoot too.

106
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:34,485
- Can you teach me?
- ( Chuckles )

107
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,920
Well, man, that's...
That's up to your parents.

108
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:41,979
Can you talk to them?
They'll listen to you.

109
00:07:42,014 --> 00:07:43,972
( Chuckles )

110
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,451
We'll see, okay?

<i>- ( Clicking )
- Hey.</i>

112
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,635
Let me see what
you've got there.

113
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,180
How the hell did this happen?

114
00:08:07,234 --> 00:08:11,491
Well, it's my fault.
I let him into the r.V.

115
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:15,081
He said he wanted a walkie,
that you sent him for one.

116
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:17,654
So on top of everything else,
he lied.

117
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:21,169
What's he thinking?

118
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,925
He wants to learn how to shoot.
He asked me to teach him.

119
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,367
Now it's none of my business,

120
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,025
but I'm happy to do it.
It's your call.

121
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,008
I'm not comfortable with it.

122
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:38,686
Oh, don't make me out to be the
unreasonable one here. Rick?

123
00:08:38,717 --> 00:08:41,062
I know. I have
my concerns too, but...

124
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:43,357
There's no but.
He was just shot.

125
00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:46,354
He's just back on his feet
and he wants a gun?

126
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,524
Better than him
being afraid of 'em.

127
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:50,537
There are guns in camp
for a reason.

128
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,130
He should learn
to handle them safely.

129
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:54,534
I don't want my kid
walking around with a gun.

130
00:08:54,566 --> 00:08:55,871
But how can you defend that?

131
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,073
You can't let him go around
without protection.

132
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:00,688
He's as safe as
he'll ever be right here.

133
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:02,709
Look, everything you're saying

134
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:05,372
makes perfect sense.
It feels wrong.

135
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,363
I mean I didn't feel good

136
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,386
about him following you
out into the woods.

137
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,711
And I wish I'd said something.
I should've gone with my gut.

138
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,672
He's growing up, thank God.

139
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:16,553
We've got to start treating
him more like an adult.

140
00:09:16,594 --> 00:09:18,137
Then he needs to act like one.

141
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:20,151
He's not mature enough
to handle a gun.

142
00:09:20,182 --> 00:09:22,230
I'm not gonna
play with it, mom.

143
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:23,571
It's not a toy.

144
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,022
I'm sorry I disappointed you,

145
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:26,934
but I want to look for Sophia

146
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:29,275
<i>and I want to defend our camp.</i>

147
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,891
I can't do that without a gun.

148
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:33,385
Shane's the best
instructor I know.

149
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,072
I've seen him teach kids
younger than Carl.

150
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:50,251
You will take this seriously

151
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,881
and you will
behave responsibly.

152
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:53,388
And if I hear from anyone
in this camp

153
00:09:53,422 --> 00:09:55,549
that you're not living up
to our expectations...

154
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,216
He won't let you down.

155
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,430
Yeah.

156
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:06,924
<i>Now if you're gonna do this,
you listen to Shane.</i>

157
00:10:06,926 --> 00:10:09,763
- Okay, dad.
- All right? You be careful.

158
00:10:09,788 --> 00:10:11,474
<i>- You coming?
- Glen: I gotta help Dale</i>

159
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,287
clean the spark plugs
on the R.V.

160
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,781
He said he's gonna
teach me mechanics.

161
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,393
I should probably go
look for him.

162
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:17,562
You found me.

163
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:19,897
<i>( Car engine starts )</i>

164
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:23,804
He's a good learner.

165
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:45,236
Spark plugs, huh?

166
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:47,010
Want to tell me
what's going on?

167
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,143
You're old.

168
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:52,738
You're...
You know things.

169
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:54,641
So...

170
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:56,953
What if somebody
told you something

171
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:59,864
that somebody else
should know...?

172
00:10:59,923 --> 00:11:01,978
Glenn, stop being dramatic.
Spit it out.

173
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:04,951
There's... there's walkers
in the barn

174
00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,485
and Lori's pregnant.

175
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:11,031
<i>( Gunfire )</i>

176
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:20,056
Hey, come on, man.
Don't give me that gangsta sссс.

177
00:11:25,262 --> 00:11:26,997
Good work.

178
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:30,686
Don't be discouraged.

179
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:32,387
You'll hit the target
eventually.

180
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:34,810
Who says I didn't hit
my target?

181
00:11:45,492 --> 00:11:47,567
Try this one.
It's heavy.

182
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:49,521
You get better balance,
twice the rounds.

183
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:04,557
I'd say she's got
the hang of it.

184
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,928
I'd say she's ready
for the advanced class.

185
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:08,925
It might be worth your while

186
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,683
after the rest of us
head back to camp.

187
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:11,879
Sure. Why not?

188
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:16,320
- How's it feeling?
- I like the weight.

189
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,824
So you decided not to leave us.

190
00:12:19,857 --> 00:12:21,520
Something change your mind?

191
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,038
- Got it.
- That's a great shot.

192
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:40,804
Nervous Nelly?

193
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:45,475
She find her way home?

194
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:48,600
Found her in her stall
this morning.

195
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,669
I love your fields.

196
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:04,881
Took a long walk this morning.

197
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:09,163
I ended up by the barn.

198
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,504
I heard the moans.

199
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,156
That's unfortunate.

200
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:20,327
I'm sure you have your reasons
for keeping this a secret.

201
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,171
I saw the broadcasts
before they stopped,

202
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:26,426
saw the irrational fear,
the atrocities,

203
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,239
like the incident at my well.

204
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,958
We put down a Walker.

205
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:34,646
You killed a person.

206
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,637
Well, if you watched

207
00:13:36,645 --> 00:13:38,819
the same broadcasts I did,

208
00:13:38,857 --> 00:13:40,790
<i>you saw walkers attack,</i>

209
00:13:40,824 --> 00:13:44,275
kill. They're dangerous.

210
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,827
A paranoid schizophrenic
is dangerous too.

211
00:13:46,873 --> 00:13:48,780
We don't shoot sick people.

212
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:51,037
With all due respect,

213
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:54,583
you are cut off
from the outside world here.

214
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,579
But I've seen people
that I cared about

215
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:59,374
die and come back,

216
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,500
and they're not people.

217
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:08,014
My wife and stepson
are in that barn.

218
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:12,650
They're people.

219
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,846
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,641
Let me help.

221
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:23,186
<i>I'll speak to Rick.
He's a good man.</i>

222
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:25,876
We can make the barn more
secure, keep everybody safe.

223
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:29,425
<i>The barn is secure.</i>

224
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:32,140
Keep this to yourself
if you want to help.

225
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,870
Rick is a man of conscience,

226
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:37,079
but are you so sure about
everyone in your group?

227
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:51,559
'Afternoon.

228
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:56,439
I take it your boy did well.

229
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,600
Not bad, actually.

230
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,495
Be grateful you don't
have a daughter.

231
00:15:03,494 --> 00:15:06,746
If only things were as simple
as wanting to shoot.

232
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,160
Carl's getting that chance,
thanks to you.

233
00:15:09,212 --> 00:15:11,500
And I'm eternally grateful

234
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:14,060
for what you did
and your hospitality.

235
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:16,137
We'll earn our keep.

236
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:19,730
I appreciate that,
but with Carl getting better,

237
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,632
I imagine you'll be
moving on soon...

238
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:26,806
Fort Benning, I hear.

239
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:42,256
( Gunshot )

240
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,875
- Still a virgin.
- The target's too small.

241
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,848
Come on, that's crap.
Half-hour ago

242
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:52,758
I saw you nail
a bull's-eye at 25'.

243
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,159
It wasn't moving.

244
00:15:54,177 --> 00:15:56,214
You think a Walker's
gonna hold still for you?

245
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,994
Focus and reload, go again.

246
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:07,058
Uh-oh, did I piss you off?

247
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:09,008
Come on, girl, you've got
walkers all around you.

248
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:11,077
They're the woods.
They're in the R.V.

249
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,853
You're gonna need more
than a damn screwdriver.

250
00:16:12,873 --> 00:16:15,622
- Stop badgering me.
- You're too damn emotional.

251
00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:18,048
You need to shut it down.
Take all that guilt,

252
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:19,993
take that fear, that being
pissed off, take it out.

253
00:16:20,027 --> 00:16:22,461
Right, 'cause you're so calm.

254
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:25,023
See that?
See, I can be pissed off.

255
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:27,082
I could be whistling "Dixie"
and I'll always hit the target.

256
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:30,213
But you, God, you shoot
like a damn girl.

257
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,494
You stand here
and you point your weapon.

258
00:16:33,528 --> 00:16:35,366
Point like you point your finger.
Do not think about it.

259
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:37,152
I'm talking about
muscle memory, girl...

260
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:38,644
Muscle memory.

261
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,136
Now go on, shoot that
son of a bitch.

262
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,377
He's coming for you!
He's 10' away!

263
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:45,064
He's 9'...
He's 5' away!

264
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:46,944
Right there, that's
the Walker that got Amy.

265
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:50,049
Now you shoot that son of a bitch!
Shoot him!

266
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:11,701
Hershel expects us to leave?

267
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:17,404
Does anybody else know?

268
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:20,812
Not yet.

269
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:25,615
- Were you gonna tell me?
- Of course.

270
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:27,597
When? How long
have you known?

271
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:30,394
Not long. You don't need
to worry about this.

272
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,641
How can you expect me not to worry?
We have shelter here

273
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:35,143
and food and water
and medical care.

274
00:17:35,192 --> 00:17:37,756
I've been talking with Hershel.
It's not carved in stone.

275
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,545
He thinks it is.

276
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,264
We have to fix this.

277
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:43,733
People are settling in here.
They'll be devastated.

278
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:45,242
I know.
I'm working on it.

279
00:17:45,276 --> 00:17:46,901
Maybe I can talk to him too
and plead our case.

280
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,778
No, things are uneasy.
The best thing right now

281
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:51,015
is to give Hershel some space.

282
00:17:52,763 --> 00:17:55,159
Don't look at me like that.

283
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:57,174
Like what?

284
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:59,179
Like you're scared.
Like you don't trust me.

285
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:01,617
I can take it from everyone
else, but not from you.

286
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:03,278
I don't understand
how you could keep

287
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,946
something like this from me.

288
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,160
Carl's barely on his feet.
And Sophia's missing.

289
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:13,004
And Daryl and T-Dog are hurt.
How can we leave?

290
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:15,591
It's not what I want either,
but if we have to go,

291
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,989
I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure

292
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:19,909
you and Carl are okay.

293
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,758
We'll get by.
We will.

294
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,157
Okay.

295
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,112
Come on, let me
give you a lift.

296
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,242
My feet work just fine.

297
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,153
Look, I'm just trying
to get you rattled,

298
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:01,392
give you an idea

299
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,336
what it's like when
the shit starts to fly.

300
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,117
Is that an apology?

301
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:08,297
I crossed the line
when I brought Amy into it.

302
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:11,186
Yeah, it's an apology.

303
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,486
You're a real dick sometimes.

304
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:15,895
Yeah, I acknowledge that.
I'll tell you what:

305
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:19,720
I've got a lead on Sophia.
I'm gonna go check it out.

306
00:19:19,755 --> 00:19:24,082
Why don't you come with me,
be my backup?

307
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:14,740
My wife was pregnant once.

308
00:20:16,144 --> 00:20:17,808
She miscarried

309
00:20:18,026 --> 00:20:20,598
and we didn't try again
after that.

310
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:23,679
I'm so sorry.

311
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,765
The thing that I remember most

312
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:28,452
is how nauseated she became

313
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:31,131
at the smell of cooking meat.

314
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,421
And she was
a meat-eating gal... my wife,

315
00:20:35,456 --> 00:20:38,835
but with the pregnancy...

316
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,371
That Thanksgiving, the Turkey...

317
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:47,029
She couldn't be in the house

318
00:20:47,086 --> 00:20:49,484
for two days until
it was aired out,

319
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:51,003
poor thing.

320
00:20:51,037 --> 00:20:53,143
Glenn told you?

321
00:20:53,178 --> 00:20:56,401
What did you expect?
The boy has no guile.

322
00:20:57,828 --> 00:20:59,842
I haven't told Rick.

323
00:21:01,537 --> 00:21:03,019
I can't.

324
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:06,673
Because of Shane?

325
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,018
Was it that obvious?

326
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:10,277
No no, I don't
think anyone knew.

327
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:13,335
I didn't, not for sure.

328
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:15,877
Look, I thought
my husband was dead.

329
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,908
And I felt like
I died with him.

330
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,696
And I...

331
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:25,629
I wanted to feel
something... anything.

332
00:21:27,357 --> 00:21:29,968
And now I hate myself for it.

333
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:32,523
And the baby?

334
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:34,372
It's Rick's.

335
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,972
None of the rest of it matters.

336
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:39,817
Then what's your concern?

337
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:42,443
Memories are
what keep me going now.

338
00:21:42,464 --> 00:21:45,302
Memories of what life
used to be.

339
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,302
And I...

340
00:21:47,324 --> 00:21:49,165
I've got a deep well
to draw on.

341
00:21:49,202 --> 00:21:50,992
I still remember joy.

342
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,984
But I think Carl's well
is already running dry.

343
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:55,856
And this baby...

344
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,711
The baby won't have
any good memories at all,

345
00:21:57,767 --> 00:22:00,334
only fear and pain.

346
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:02,672
You can't think like that.

347
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:05,887
We can still find joy

348
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:09,175
and we can still take
strength from each other.

349
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:11,457
Do you really think
this baby has a chance,

350
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:14,661
that it could grow up
and live a happy life?

351
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:17,163
Look me in the eye and tell me

352
00:22:17,197 --> 00:22:20,755
that my baby will grow up
to be your age

353
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:24,112
and die happy.

354
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:27,312
Tell me... tell me
you believe that.

355
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:48,364
I'm sorry. I'm... it just came out.
And it was Dale.

356
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:51,426
It's okay. I never should have
put you in that position.

357
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,865
I've been thinking
about what you said

358
00:22:54,898 --> 00:22:56,957
about needing help.

359
00:22:56,996 --> 00:22:59,204
And you're right that I do.

360
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,043
Name it. Yeah.

361
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:03,043
If you're still willing to
make a run into town for me...

362
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:04,633
I'm your man.

363
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:07,447
Thank you.

364
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:11,300
It's okay.
It's not a big deal really.

Glenn:
You didn't have to come.

366
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:23,180
You could hate me
from a distance.

367

Please say something.

I asked for your trust
and you betrayed it.

370
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:42,926
Now my dad's pissed at me.

00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:46,763
Your turn.

372
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:53,151
So your dad thinks
they're sick?

373
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:54,908
You agree with that,

at the well?</i>

at the well.

Yes, you are.

377
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:07,222
Look, if you'd seen Atlanta,

378
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:09,062
you would not have
a barn full of walkers.

379

calling them that.

00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:48,149
Um, I...

484
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:50,064
- The place was overrun.
- Yeah.

485
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:55,367
Let's go get you cleaned up.

486
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:09,079
Shane, Shane, I was thinking,

487
00:36:09,136 --> 00:36:10,966
<i>you've got that
nice new ride of yours,</i>

488
00:36:10,998 --> 00:36:14,151
plenty of fuel, more than enough
for you to get far from here.

489
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:16,138
What, you telling me to leave?

490
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:17,982
I know you've been planning to.

491
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,246
Maybe now is a good time.

492
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:22,386
Is this about Andrea?

493
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,897
I'm looking out for the group.

494
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:28,722
You think the group would be
better off without me, Dale?

495
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:31,102
Why don't you tell that
to Rick or Lori?

496
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:33,630
Their boy would be dead if I
hadn't put my ass on the line.

497
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:34,872
And Otis's.

498
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:39,943
You've been vague about that
night, about what happened.

499
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:46,174
Otis died a hero.

500
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:47,718
So you've said.

501
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:50,302
A little boy lived because of
what went down that night.

502
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:52,797
I think you ought
to show some gratitude.

503
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:55,007
- I wasn't there.
- No, man, you weren't.

504
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:57,523
But I was the time that you
raised your gun on Rick.

505
00:36:57,556 --> 00:37:00,140
- Come on. Jesus.
- You had him in your sights

506
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,642
and you held him there.

507
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:08,679
I know what kind of man
you are.

508
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,761
You think I'd shoot Rick?

509
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:19,382
That is my best friend.

510
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,216
That's the man that I love.

511
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,602
I love him like
he's my a brother.

512
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:26,108
You think that's
the kind of man I am?

513
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:27,658
That's right.

514
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:29,715
Well, maybe we ought
to just think that through.

515
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:31,713
Say I'm the kind of man

516
00:37:31,746 --> 00:37:34,293
who'd gun down
his own best friend.

517
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:37,390
What do you think I'd do to
some guy that I don't even like

518
00:37:37,436 --> 00:37:39,980
when he starts throwing
accusations my way?

519
00:37:40,005 --> 00:37:41,977
What do you think?

520
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:31,310
<i>( Insects chirping )</i>

521
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,995
Is there something
you need to tell me?

522
00:38:53,336 --> 00:38:55,600
We can't leave.
I'm pregnant.

523
00:38:55,797 --> 00:38:57,863
Are you?

524
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,214
I threw them up.

525
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:09,870
You can yell if you want.

526
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:13,433
You can scream if you have to,

527
00:39:13,496 --> 00:39:15,444
but talk to me.

528
00:39:17,448 --> 00:39:19,875
How long have you known?

529
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,731
Does it matter?

530
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:29,127
Days? Weeks?
And you didn't tell me?

531
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:30,962
- I'm telling you now.
- No.

532
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:35,192
I found these.
So Glenn knows, right?

533
00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:38,697
Instead of going to me,
you sent him to get pills?

534
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:41,960
I panicked. You tell me we
have no roof and no walls...

535
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:44,853
Do not put this on me!

536
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:47,931
You tear into me for keeping secrets
when you're holding onto this?

537
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:49,937
You want me to bring
a baby into this?

538
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,190
To live a short, cruel life?

539
00:39:52,232 --> 00:39:54,265
How can you think like that?

540
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:56,642
We can't even protect
the son we already have.

541
00:39:56,697 --> 00:39:59,033
So this is the solution?

542
00:39:59,072 --> 00:40:01,455
Rick, I threw them up.

543
00:40:02,497 --> 00:40:04,575
I screwed up.

544
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:09,247
I don't know how we do this.

545
00:40:22,303 --> 00:40:24,942
We can make it work.

546
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:28,634
How? Tell me how.

547
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:29,956
We'll figure it out.

548
00:40:29,983 --> 00:40:32,607
Shouldn't we try
to figure it out?

549
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,811
You threw up the pills.

550
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:38,039
You want this baby.
I know you do.

551
00:40:38,078 --> 00:40:39,906
Not like this.

552
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:42,485
Not giving birth in a ditch.

553
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:45,922
Not when its life
will hang by a thread

554
00:40:45,962 --> 00:40:48,096
from the second it's born.

555
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:50,662
Not when every cry will put it,

556
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:53,586
and Carl, and everyone
we care about, in danger.

557
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:55,115
That's not right.

558
00:40:55,149 --> 00:40:58,293
Rick not even giving it a
chance isn't right either.

559
00:40:58,327 --> 00:41:00,047
Maybe this is why
I didn't want to tell you.

560
00:41:00,093 --> 00:41:03,949
I still... I still
don't understand why.

561
00:41:03,983 --> 00:41:07,997
You really think I'd make you
have a baby you don't want?

562
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:11,347
No, so that if I
went through with it,

563
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:14,644
it would be on my
conscience and not yours.

564
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:19,279
Maybe that's true,

565
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:22,158
but I can't live
like this anymore,

566
00:41:22,192 --> 00:41:25,353
Lori.

567
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,361
We can't live like this.

568
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:32,202
Is there anything else

569
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:34,385
I should know about?

570
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:45,518
Shane and I.

571
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:56,096
I know.
Of course I know.

572
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:06,427
You thought I was dead.

573
00:42:09,421 --> 00:42:13,297
The world went to shit
and you thought I was dead.

574
00:42:13,426 --> 00:42:15,380
Right?

575
00:42:24,802 --> 00:42:25,881
Yeah.

576
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:38,047
