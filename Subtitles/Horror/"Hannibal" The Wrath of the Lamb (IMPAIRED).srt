1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:02,506
<i>- Previously on Hannibal...
- You know and I know it's</i>

2
00:00:02,507 --> 00:00:05,630
- the best way to bait
him. - So I really bad-mouth

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,724
- the Red Dragon in Tattle Crime.
- It'd feel like a trap to me.

4
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:13,393
I have blasphemed against the dragon.
There is much for you to dread.

5
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:16,122
You orchestrated his end, Alana.

6
00:00:16,123 --> 00:00:19,098
I am the Dragon.

7
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:27,098
Get up.

8
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:29,568
Stand by the bed.

9
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:34,439
Do you know where you are in the room?

10
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:39,811
And you know where you are in the house?

11
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,814
Then you know

12
00:00:42,882 --> 00:00:45,684
where the front door is, don't you?

13
00:00:51,424 --> 00:00:53,692
Reba,

14
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,860
feel on my chest.

15
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:05,904
Bring your hands up slowly. Don't!

16
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:08,606
...do what you're thinking.

17
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:12,510
Just feel on my chest.

18
00:01:12,578 --> 00:01:14,512
(zipper undoing)

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,548
Just around my throat. You feel that?

20
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:20,518
It's a key.

21
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:23,054
Take it off over my head.

22
00:01:23,122 --> 00:01:25,056
Careful.

23
00:01:25,124 --> 00:01:27,792
Now

24
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:33,965
I'm going to see if I can trust you.

25
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:38,937
Go to the front door, lock it.

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,942
Go ahead.

27
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,178
- I'll wait right here.
- (whimpering)

28
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:52,983
Don't try to run.

29
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:00,057
I can catch you.

30
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,627
(clock continuously ticking)

31
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:35,758
Ah!

32
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:41,497
Oh, Reba.

33
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:52,842
Now lock the door

34
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,179
and put the key around my neck.

35
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:03,652
Hang it around my neck.

36
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,260
Now let's make sure it's locked, shall we?

37
00:03:11,328 --> 00:03:15,064
- (rattling)
- Very good.

38
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:18,968
Now go on back to the bedroom.

39
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:24,405
You know the way.

40
00:03:36,886 --> 00:03:38,920
Sit down.

41
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,591
And sit still

42
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,061
or I can't keep Him off you.

43
00:03:46,128 --> 00:03:48,163
Please try.

44
00:03:51,467 --> 00:03:53,501
Put out your hand.

45
00:03:57,206 --> 00:03:59,274
Feel this.

46
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,779
Don't grab it, feel it.

47
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:09,251
It's a shotgun.

48
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:13,855
(gasping)

49
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:18,092
Do you know what it will do?

50
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:20,194
Take your hand down.

51
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:27,468
I wish I could have trusted you.

52
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:32,407
I wanted to trust you.

53
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:37,111
You felt so good.

54
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:40,214
(crying): So did you, D.

55
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,216
I love it.

56
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:45,620
Please don't hurt me now.

57
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:49,223
(gasping)

58
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:58,332
It's all over for me.

59
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:03,738
(clanging)

60
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,809
I can't give you to Him.

61
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,210
You know what He will do.

62
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,982
No...no, no, no, no...

63
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,084
He will bite you.

64
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,202
Better you go with me.

65
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,406
No, no, no, no, no.

66
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:43,710
(escalating screaming)

67
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,416
(crying)

68
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,418
Oh God, no...

69
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:54,553
Oh, Reba...

70
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,024
I can't stand to watch you burn.

71
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,026
(screaming)

72
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,864
- (gun cocking)
- No!

73
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,966
(gunshot)

74
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,742
(gasping)

75
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,558
(clock ticking)

76
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,232
(distorted piano plays)

77
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,443
(theme music)

78
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:09,414
<b>sync and corrected by Caio
www.addic7ed.com</b>

79
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,989
He shot himself in the face.

80
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:27,327
I put my hand in it.

81
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:32,232
He set fire to the house.

82
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:36,870
He shot himself.

83
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:39,372
I put my hand in it.

84
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,374
(whispering): He was on the...

85
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:44,411
the floor...

86
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:51,150
I won't put you through this again,

87
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:54,954
but I'd like to come back by.

88
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:57,457
Just to say hi and see how you're doing.

89
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,759
How could you help it?

90
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,861
A charmer like me.

91
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:19,946
In the end, he couldn't kill you

92
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:23,282
and he couldn't watch you die.

93
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:27,887
The people who study this kind
of thing say that he was trying

94
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:31,958
to stop because you helped him.

95
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,493
Probably saved some lives.

96
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:38,865
- I drew a freak.
- You didn't draw a freak.

97
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:44,419
You drew a man with a freak on his back.

98
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,209
There is nothing wrong with you.

99
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:53,646
I know there's nothing wrong with me.

100
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:56,715
In making friends, I
try to be wary of people

101
00:08:56,784 --> 00:08:58,717
who foster dependency

102
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:01,320
and feed on it.

103
00:09:03,824 --> 00:09:07,960
I've been with a few.
The blind attract them.

104
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:14,465
Not just the blind.

105
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:24,810
(ominous music)

106
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:49,099
Ding-dong, the Dragon's dead.

107
00:09:55,974 --> 00:10:00,712
- Are congratulations in order?
- I didn't kill him.

108
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,814
Suicide.

109
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:11,922
Then he wasn't as strong
as the Dragon after all.

110
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,558
He was trying to stop.

111
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,798
I was rooting for you, Will.

112
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:24,401
It's a shame.

113
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:26,803
You came all this way

114
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:28,906
and you didn't get to kill anybody.

115
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:34,644
Only consolation is Dr. Chilton.

116
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:39,316
Congratulations for the job you did on him.

117
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:42,152
I admired it enormously.

118
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:47,191
What a cunning boy you are.

119
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:51,461
Are you accusing me of something?

120
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:56,600
Does the enemy inside you
agree with the accusation?

121
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:59,736
Even a little bit?

122
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:03,006
I came back to stop the Dragon.

123
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:09,045
He's stopped.

124
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:13,650
Your family was on his itinerary.

125
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:15,786
Safe now.

126
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:18,087
You can go home again.

127
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,223
If there's any point.

128
00:11:22,226 --> 00:11:24,694
Is there any point?

129
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,932
I like my life there.

130
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:32,969
It won't be the same.

131
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:37,040
You'll see it's not the same.

132
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:41,911
The unspoken knowledge will live with you,

133
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:44,113
like unwanted company in the house.

134
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:46,749
Molly and I want it to be the same.

135
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:51,887
When life becomes maddeningly polite...

136
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:56,259
...think about me.

137
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,964
Think about me, Will,

138
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:03,066
don't worry about me.

139
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:21,117
(sighing)

140
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:26,822
You turned yourself in so I
would always know where you were.

141
00:12:32,562 --> 00:12:34,497
You'd only do that

142
00:12:34,564 --> 00:12:37,165
if I rejected you.

143
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:44,540
Goodbye.

144
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:50,345
Will...

145
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:58,253
Was it good to see me?

146
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,322
Good?

147
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,326
No.

148
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,741
(loud bang)

149
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:30,852
(strangling sounds)

150
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,264
Do you think you can sit up?

151
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,533
Try to sit up.

152
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:03,543
You didn't break my back.

153
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:09,247
Your face

154
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,284
is closed to me.

155
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,423
If I can see you,

156
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,495
you can see me.

157
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,800
You think you understand, don't you?

158
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:34,473
"I understand "that blood and breath

159
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,110
"are only elements undergoing change

160
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,147
to fuel your Radiance."

161
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,686
Hannibal said those words.

162
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:51,490
To me.

163
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,928
I wanted to share with Lecter,

164
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,498
and Lecter betrayed me.

165
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:04,336
He betrayed me, too.

166
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,939
I would like to share.

167
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,979
You shared

168
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:18,082
with Reba.

169
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,987
I shared with Reba a little,

170
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,255
in a way that she could survive.

171
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:27,959
But you didn't change her.

172
00:15:28,026 --> 00:15:31,161
I chose not to change her.

173
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:34,431
I'm stronger than the Dragon now.

174
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,270
Hannibal Lecter

175
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:43,508
is who you need to change.

176
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,481
I want to meet Lecter.

177
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,317
How would I manage that?

178
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,124
The only teeth we found in the skull

179
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,292
were Grandma's dentures.

180
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,563
And the upper part was made of vulcanite
instead of acrylic like they use today.

181
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:08,899
No one's made vulcanite
plates in fifty years.

182
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:11,200
Dolarhyde had a new acrylic set

183
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:13,970
just like it made to fit
him. Chinese manufacturer.

184
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,339
The new pair we found on the body.

185
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:19,709
Grandma's old yucky pair
we found in his mouth.

186
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:21,711
Well, not his mouth, per
se. We think it's a guy

187
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,847
named Arnold Lang... he's missing.

188
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:26,215
Worked at a service station near Dolarhyde.

189
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:28,584
Found his car, but it had been wiped clean.

190
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:30,786
So Dolarhyde snuffs out Lang,

191
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:34,290
takes the dead body back to the house, then
does this whole thing with the blind lady,

192
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:36,625
song and dance, "Will I shoot you?
Won't I shoot you? I don't know."

193
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:39,328
"I can't stand to see you
burn. Boo hoo!" And then blows

194
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:41,597
Lang's head away with a twelve-gauge.

195
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:45,368
So the routine of hanging the key around
his neck was to be sure she felt the body.

196
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:47,370
So she could tell us

197
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:50,106
she certainly felt a body.

198
00:16:50,174 --> 00:16:53,476
The Great Red Dragon lives.

199
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:56,212
The obvious thing is to
get him to come to us.

200
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,114
Bait him with something

201
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:01,684
he wants more than me.

202
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:03,652
He'd have to be an idiot to go for it.

203
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,422
I know. Want to hear what
the best bait would be?

204
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,825
I'm not sure I want to.

205
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:12,027
Hannibal would be the best bait.

206
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:16,498
Why in God's name would anyone
want to meet Hannibal Lecter?

207
00:17:16,566 --> 00:17:19,768
To kill him, Jack.

208
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:22,471
The Dragon could absorb him that way,

209
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:26,308
engulf him, become more than he is.

210
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:31,714
You sound pretty sure.

211
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:35,951
I'm not sure. Who's sure?

212
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:38,487
I'm not even sure Hannibal
would draw the Dragon.

213
00:17:38,554 --> 00:17:41,889
I just say that it's our best shot.

214
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:47,162
Set him up how?

215
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:51,333
We take Hannibal into federal custody.

216
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,169
We fake an escape.

217
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:13,221
(liquid splashing)

218
00:18:18,226 --> 00:18:22,363
We assign a moment to decision.

219
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,431
What you propose

220
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:27,768
is so thoughtless,

221
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:32,273
I find it difficult to imagine

222
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,042
- that moment exists.
- Decisions

223
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:37,944
are made of kneaded feelings.

224
00:18:40,715 --> 00:18:44,218
They're more often a lump than a sum.

225
00:18:46,254 --> 00:18:50,824
However you think you're
going to manipulate

226
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:53,594
this situation to your advantage,

227
00:18:55,596 --> 00:18:59,299
- think again.
- There is no advantage.

228
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:05,171
It's all degrees of disadvantage.

229
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:09,742
"Who holds the Devil,
let him hold him well.

230
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:14,980
"He will hardly be caught a second time."

231
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:20,553
(whispering): I don't intend
Hannibal to be caught a second time.

232
00:19:24,057 --> 00:19:28,561
Can't live with him.
Can't live without him.

233
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:33,499
Is that what this is?

234
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,802
I guess

235
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,803
this is

236
00:19:38,871 --> 00:19:41,707
my Becoming.

237
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:46,478
What you are "becoming" is pathological.

238
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:48,880
Extreme acts of cruelty

239
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:53,051
require a high degree of empathy.

240
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,489
You've just found religion.

241
00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:59,758
Nothing more dangerous than that.

242
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:08,967
I'd pack my bags if I were you, Bedelia.

243
00:20:09,034 --> 00:20:12,170
Meat's back on the menu.

244
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:15,606
You righteous, reckless,

245
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,409
twitchy little man.

246
00:20:18,477 --> 00:20:20,511
He might as well cut all of our throats

247
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:23,547
and be done with it.

248
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:26,717
Ready or not.

249
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:28,852
Here he comes.

250
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:57,129
Dr. Bloom.

251
00:20:57,196 --> 00:21:00,432
You finally broke down and came to visit.

252
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,601
Your face

253
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,938
did not change at all

254
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:08,306
when you first looked at me.

255
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:13,145
Shock, in seeing me,

256
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:17,749
is usually delayed.

257
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:21,819
I wanted to see you, Frederick.

258
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,724
I wanted to remind myself

259
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:28,893
what Hannibal is capable of.

260
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:31,429
What Hannibal is capable of.

261
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,101
What Will Graham is capable of.

262
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:41,439
What you

263
00:21:41,506 --> 00:21:43,675
are capable of.

264
00:21:43,742 --> 00:21:45,677
You...

265
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:48,980
were the roper.

266
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:51,049
Too bad there was not enough rope

267
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:54,751
for you to hang yourself with.

268
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:57,521
Just enough

269
00:21:57,589 --> 00:22:00,524
to hang me.

270
00:22:00,592 --> 00:22:03,194
Who does Will Graham

271
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:05,729
have you roping now?

272
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:11,034
Hannibal.

273
00:22:11,103 --> 00:22:13,337
(strained laughing)

274
00:22:16,374 --> 00:22:18,775
Tethers, if I had them,

275
00:22:18,843 --> 00:22:21,245
I would burn the man alive.

276
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:26,617
Though,

277
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:28,919
maybe I would rather

278
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:31,522
have his skin.

279
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,659
I've been getting grafts.

280
00:22:35,727 --> 00:22:37,761
How I would love to count

281
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:41,665
Hannibal among my donors.

282
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:44,067
You were never comfortable

283
00:22:44,135 --> 00:22:46,336
in your own skin, Frederick.

284
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:52,542
You wouldn't be comfortable in Hannibal's.

285
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,112
Are you?

286
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:12,029
There's a deal for you, Hannibal.

287
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:14,430
Or there could be.

288
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:17,867
A deal? With whom?

289
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:21,704
The FBI.

290
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:26,409
Jack couldn't ask me himself?

291
00:23:26,477 --> 00:23:29,078
Jack doesn't know you as well as I do.

292
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:32,549
He thought if he asked you for
help, you would just torment him.

293
00:23:32,616 --> 00:23:35,285
Quite right, too.

294
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:38,555
How wise of Jack.

295
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:43,226
The Red Dragon faked his death.

296
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:45,895
Good for him.

297
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:48,864
Jack wants to fake your escape.

298
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:53,035
I release you into police custody.

299
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:56,005
And Jack uses you as bait.

300
00:23:58,075 --> 00:24:00,543
Was it Will's idea?

301
00:24:00,611 --> 00:24:04,480
Yes.

302
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:08,817
Yes. That worked out so
well for Frederick Chilton.

303
00:24:08,884 --> 00:24:11,687
Do please tell Frederick,

304
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:14,456
if you see him, I wish
a speedy convalescence

305
00:24:14,524 --> 00:24:16,791
and hope he won't be very ugly.

306
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:19,094
I've been on the phone

307
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,830
for hours on your behalf,
and this is what you get...

308
00:24:21,897 --> 00:24:26,868
Any rational society would either
kill me or give me my books.

309
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,141
If you cooperate in the
capture of Francis Dolarhyde,

310
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:35,143
you get your books,

311
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:38,347
your drawings. Your toilet.

312
00:24:38,414 --> 00:24:41,015
All privileges will be restored.

313
00:24:44,487 --> 00:24:46,722
You trust Will with my well-being?

314
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:51,926
As much as I trust you with his.

315
00:24:54,697 --> 00:24:56,632
You trust me with yours?

316
00:24:56,699 --> 00:25:00,468
You intend to release
me into police custody.

317
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:03,238
Police are not as wise as you are.

318
00:25:06,142 --> 00:25:08,276
I might escape in earnest

319
00:25:08,343 --> 00:25:10,711
and come to kill you.

320
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,215
First chance you get, I assume.

321
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:17,518
You died in my kitchen, Alana,

322
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:21,289
when you chose to be brave.

323
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:25,260
Every moment since is borrowed.

324
00:25:27,196 --> 00:25:29,363
Your wife...

325
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:32,333
your child...

326
00:25:32,401 --> 00:25:35,236
they belong to me.

327
00:25:35,304 --> 00:25:37,839
We made a bargain for Will's life,

328
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:40,608
and then I spun you gold.

329
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:53,887
Hannibal has tentatively
agreed to the deal, as proposed.

330
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:58,392
What will it take to
make him less tentative?

331
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,762
He wants Will to ask him.

332
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,932
And he wants you to say "please."

333
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,501
I'll say "pretty please."

334
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,741
Well, people are going to stampede

335
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:15,743
if they think that Lecter is out.

336
00:26:15,811 --> 00:26:18,646
Let them stampede.

337
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:20,948
Authenticity.

338
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,950
And let them believe

339
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:25,419
I helped Hannibal escape.

340
00:26:27,622 --> 00:26:30,023
Authenticity?

341
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:33,160
Someone has to be close.

342
00:26:33,228 --> 00:26:35,662
When the Dragon comes.

343
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,098
And then?

344
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:44,971
We kill Dolarhyde.

345
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,408
And then...

346
00:26:48,476 --> 00:26:50,677
we kill Hannibal.

347
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,483
To the Devil his due.

348
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:02,440
I thought you said your good-byes.

349
00:27:02,508 --> 00:27:04,642
We've one last good-bye between us.

350
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,879
You didn't just say
good-bye, though, did you?

351
00:27:10,282 --> 00:27:13,584
That little extra bit at the end.

352
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:15,686
What was that you said?

353
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:21,091
You'd never have turned yourself
in unless I rejected you.

354
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:23,460
Yes. That extra bit.

355
00:27:25,663 --> 00:27:28,498
I believe that's what
they call a "mic drop."

356
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:31,868
You dropped the mic, Will, but here you are

357
00:27:31,937 --> 00:27:34,805
having to come back and pick it up again.

358
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:37,207
I knew you would keep running

359
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:40,277
if I kept chasing you.

360
00:27:40,345 --> 00:27:43,447
I knew you wanted me to know
exactly where I could find you

361
00:27:43,514 --> 00:27:45,449
when I needed to.

362
00:27:45,516 --> 00:27:47,751
And you did.

363
00:27:50,956 --> 00:27:53,723
I need you, Hannibal.

364
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:58,895
Ding-dong. The Dragon's not dead.

365
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:02,066
He told you he wanted to meet you.
Maybe that was a serious invitation.

366
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:05,234
After the big escape,

367
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:07,536
you send a message to the
Dragon in the personal ads,

368
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:11,540
- ask him for a rendezvous.
- He won't go near a mail drop.

369
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,510
He might be curious enough to
look at one, see if you sold him.

370
00:28:14,578 --> 00:28:16,512
We chose a drop

371
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,914
that can be watched only from a few places

372
00:28:18,983 --> 00:28:21,417
a long way off,

373
00:28:21,485 --> 00:28:23,819
and we'll stake out the observation points.

374
00:28:27,124 --> 00:28:31,461
It sounds weak to you, even as you say it.

375
00:28:31,528 --> 00:28:33,696
Secret Service has a
setup they've never used.

376
00:28:33,763 --> 00:28:35,798
They'll let us have it.

377
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:41,204
You're our best shot, Hannibal.

378
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,544
Please.

379
00:29:12,468 --> 00:29:16,437
(sirens)

380
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,654
(tires screeching)

381
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:35,889
(banging and crashing)

382
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:43,196
(warped sirens)

383
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:54,875
(muffled shot)

384
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:01,882
(muffled shot)

385
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:30,776
He's not going to kill us here.

386
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:34,080
What he wants to do requires
something a little more private.

387
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:38,283
What are you doing?

388
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:40,385
You know, Will, you worry too much.

389
00:30:40,453 --> 00:30:42,787
(distant tires screeching)

390
00:30:42,855 --> 00:30:46,091
You'd be much more comfortable

391
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,427
if you relaxed with yourself.

392
00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:09,681
Going my way?

393
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:13,852
♪

394
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,352
(waves crashing)

395
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,157
The bluff is eroding.

396
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:34,196
There was more land when
I was here with Abigail.

397
00:32:34,263 --> 00:32:37,232
More land still when I
was here with Miriam Lass.

398
00:32:42,204 --> 00:32:45,206
Now you're here with me.

399
00:32:45,274 --> 00:32:47,308
And the bluff is still eroding.

400
00:32:49,478 --> 00:32:52,547
You and I are suspended
over the roiling Atlantic.

401
00:32:52,615 --> 00:32:56,584
Soon all of this will be lost to the sea.

402
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:07,520
(gentle piano plays)

403
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:21,103
You're playing games with
yourself in the dark of the moon.

404
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:27,940
Wasn't surprising that I heard
from the Great Red Dragon.

405
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:32,046
Was it surprising when you heard from him?

406
00:33:37,553 --> 00:33:40,388
Yes and no.

407
00:33:44,727 --> 00:33:47,429
You intend to watch him kill me?

408
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:51,766
I intend to watch him change you.

409
00:33:57,606 --> 00:33:59,540
My compassion for you

410
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:02,309
is inconvenient, Will.

411
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:05,379
If you're partial to beef products,

412
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:09,450
it is inconvenient to be
compassionate toward a cow.

413
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:26,033
Save yourself, kill them all?

414
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,174
I don't know if I can save myself.

415
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:38,779
Maybe that's just fine.

416
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:51,491
"No greater love hath man than to
lay down his life for a friend."

417
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:59,933
- He's watching us now.
- I know.

418
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,304
(bursting)

419
00:35:12,113 --> 00:35:14,214
(smashing)

420
00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:28,194
Don't run. I'll catch you.

421
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:35,301
(heavy breathing)

422
00:35:35,368 --> 00:35:37,402
Hello, Francis.

423
00:35:39,372 --> 00:35:41,773
Hello, Dr. Lecter.

424
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:49,315
I'm so happy you chose life, Francis.

425
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,386
Suicide is the enemy.

426
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:01,793
You were seized by a fantasy world

427
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:06,998
with the brilliance and

428
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:10,902
freshness and immediacy of childhood.

429
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:16,007
It took you a step beyond alone.

430
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:21,635
I'm going to film your death, Dr. Lecter,

431
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:30,961
as dying, you meld with
the strength of the Dragon.

432
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:38,397
It's a glorious and
rather discomforting idea.

433
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:44,717
Watching the film will be wonderful,

434
00:36:46,497 --> 00:36:49,546
but not as wonderful as the act itself.

435
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,944
