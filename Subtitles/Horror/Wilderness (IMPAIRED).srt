Well, not much,
to be honest.

400
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,560
I served in Bosra
with the 7th Armoured
Brigade

00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,494
because I joined

are your Republican Guard,
Fedayin, Taliban types.

so, yeah,
you're right.

special Unit Youth
experience,

How much experience
have you had

and how they got that way?

408

have done.

Fuck!

Ha!

shit!

1276
01:26:31,052 --> 01:26:32,349
You knew?

1277
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:37,722
Knew?

1278
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:43,255
I asked him to come.

1279
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:46,329
I told him
we'd be here.

1280
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:51,336
This...
was because of you?

1281
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,101
Yeah.

1282
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:58,041
I just told him
all of the things they
did to me and Davie,

1283
01:26:58,112 --> 01:26:59,739
those fucking bastards!

1284
01:27:00,682 --> 01:27:01,910
I knew he'd come.

1285
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:05,175
I knew he'd come
and I knew he'd
hunt 'em down.

1286
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:07,187
What about me?

1287
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:08,654
<i>And Jo?</i>

1288
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:10,850
<i>And Jed?</i>

1289
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:12,916
And Louise?!

1290
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:18,658
You fucking
murdering bastard!

1291
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,758
Aaah!!!
Aaaahhh!

Argh.

Ah!

[coughs]

1297

Where are
the others?

1298
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:37,430
What do we
do now?

1299
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,806
I'm not staying here
just to get sent back.

1300
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,537
What?

1301
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:50,206
I died on this island.

1302
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:51,581
We all died.
