I saw them, you didn't.

170
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:04,763
They took the place down,

Bitch, how did you
make it this far?

185
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:49,207
Honey, you need to take some yoga
breaths and calm your ass down.

00:11:37,808 --> 00:11:42,294
All this and you're scared

It doesn't matter

Donnie: She got a bun in the
oven, she doesn't look it.

I'm only two months, I think.

201
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:19,130
You're some kind of stupid,

00:12:19,132 --> 00:12:21,383
getting knocked up

<i>You think that's funny?</i>

204
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,472
When was it ever smart
to get knocked up?

205
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:30,692
Women used to just die
in childbirth.

206
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:32,977
And they always thought
the world was gonna end.

<i>Living through it,
why would you just give up?</i>

But are you gonna
live through it?

209
00:12:40,704 --> 00:12:43,405
Anyway, that's cute.

210
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,907
Babies are the point.

211
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,259
Children are our future.

212
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,331
Making bite-size snacks
for the dead.

213
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:58,219
The point is to stay standing.

214
00:12:58,221 --> 00:12:59,504
<i>No.</i>

215
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:03,258

That's right.

You are.

219
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:13,551

(laughing)

224
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,888
Honey, in case
you haven't noticed,

225
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,625
you've got bigger problems
than a little secondhand smoke.

226
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:57,796
Molls.

227

Those things'll kill you.

232

They already have.

233
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:30,678
I'm a dead woman walking.

234
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,183
Which puts us
in exactly the same boat.

235
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:38,486

236

238
00:14:53,786 --> 00:14:55,803
My arm feels like it's on fire.

You pull that off, you gonna
be nothing but a spigot.

240
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,974
- Okay, hold on.
- Agh!

241
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:04,611
Scout crew is coming. They're
30 minutes out, maybe less.

Maggie:
<i>He doesn't have 30 minutes.</i>

243
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,983
His nerves are dying.

244
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:12,453
If he doesn't get medical help,
he's gonna lose his arm,

245
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:15,739
maybe his life.

246
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:18,992
I'm not a doctor, but my dad lost
his leg, and I know that much.

Your man, Primo,
you think he can help you?

252
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:05,005
She did this to me.

253

She did it and she's just
sitting there

254

Paula: <i>No, we wait
for the others.</i>

258

We have to be smart.
We need insurance.

259
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:22,806
Then shoot her in the arm, too.

(chuckles)
No.

261

00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,825
Look for my boyfriend's body.

318
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:38,929
Did you find him?

319
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,498
<i>He was blown up.</i>

320
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,834
<i>Not much to find.</i>

321
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,574
<i>"Frankie."</i>

322
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:53,577
- Was that his name?
- Hell, no.

323
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:57,330
I barely knew him.

324
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:59,116
He was a dick.

325
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,623
Frank was my dad.

326
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,761
And that's what I was
gonna name the baby.

327
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,820
- I'm sorry.
- No.

328
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:25,775
You aren't.

329
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:28,111
I'm not planning to die today.

330
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:31,164
Yeah, me neither.

331
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:36,119
Thing is, one of us is wrong.

332
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:43,293
Just tell me where.

333
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:53,553
(sighs)

334
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:59,681
Rick on radio:
<i>Have you thought about it?</i>

335
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,806
<i>Talk to me.</i>

336
00:22:01,808 --> 00:22:04,676
<i>(walkers growling)</i>

337
00:22:04,678 --> 00:22:07,262
- <i>(static hissing)</i>
- You weren't listening.

338
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:09,764
I said I'd contact you.

339
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:11,599
<i>- (static hissing)</i>
- Rick:<i> Would it make a difference</i>

340
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,768
<i>if I said I was sorry
about that?</i>

341
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:16,154
What do you think?

342
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:19,324
<i>- (static hissing)
- I think we're gonna make the trade,</i>

343
00:22:19,326 --> 00:22:20,942
<i>so tell me where.</i>

344
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,830
We haven't agreed to that.

345
00:22:25,832 --> 00:22:29,000
<i>- (static hissing)</i>
- Rick:<i> You will.</i>

346
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:32,120
You know what?
I'm not so sure.

347
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:35,840
We'd be taking most of the risk,

348
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:38,626
not getting much
in the way of a reward.

349
00:22:38,628 --> 00:22:43,181
<i>- (static hissing)</i>
- Rick:<i> The other option won't work out for you.</i>

350
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:49,354
We'll take our chances.

351
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,148
(sighs) You don't
have to do this.

352
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,482
You don't have to fight.

353
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:04,819
Your people killed
all of my people.

354
00:23:04,821 --> 00:23:06,154
Of course we gotta fight.

355
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:09,691
- We didn't want to.
- But you did.

356
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:11,859
So tell me why.

357
00:23:14,547 --> 00:23:17,715
Your people ambushed
my people on the road,

358
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:19,834
tried to take everything we had.

359
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:26,090
They were gonna kill them.

360
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:28,893
Well, damn.

361
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:32,263
So now we know what
happened to T's group.

362
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:36,267
Those idiots.

363
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:38,353
Probably put on a big show.

364
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:42,774
Okay, fair play.

365
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:45,360
You were just
defending yourselves.

366
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:52,834
But, see, your people killed
them on the road, right?

367
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:56,087
<i>Blew them to pieces.</i>

368
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,289
<i>So, why not stop?</i>

369
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:05,713
They said they were
working for Negan.

370
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,717
And what do you think
you know about Negan?

371
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:13,938
He sounded like a maniac.

372
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,606
We were scared.
We had to stop him.

373
00:24:15,608 --> 00:24:18,693
Sweetie, sweetie.

374
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:21,396
We are all Negan.

375
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:28,119
- What do you mean?
- <i>(Molly coughing)</i>

376
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:33,241
What does that mean?

377
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:36,878
(coughing)

378
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:50,758
<i>(walkers growling faintly)</i>

379
00:24:55,014 --> 00:24:56,764
Can I have one?

380
00:24:57,934 --> 00:25:01,018
Well, look at you, little bird.

381
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,155
I didn't think you approved.

382
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:06,324
I don't.

383
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:18,553
(lighter clicks)

384
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:31,048
You are weak.

385
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:34,552
What are you so afraid of?

386
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,024
So scared, you can't even
stick to your own principles.

387
00:25:43,146 --> 00:25:46,364
You don't want me to stick
to my own principles.

388
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:59,660
I was a secretary before.

389
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:06,217
I fetched coffee for my boss

390
00:26:06,219 --> 00:26:09,053
and made him feel
good about himself.

391
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:11,339
I spent most of my days reading

392
00:26:11,341 --> 00:26:13,925
stupid inspirational
e-mails

393
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:16,561
to try and feel good
about myself.

394
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:19,931
There was this one
that kept going around.

395
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:23,184
<i>A young woman
was having a hard time</i>

396
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:26,070
<i>and told her mom
she wanted to give up,</i>

397
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:27,905
so her mom went to the kitchen

398
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:31,325
and started boiling
three pots of water.

399
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:33,861
She put a carrot in one,
an egg in another,

400
00:26:33,863 --> 00:26:36,364
and ground coffee beans
in the last one.

401
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:40,034
<i>After they had boiled
a while, her mom said,</i>

402
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:43,621
<i>"Look, all three things went
through the same boiling water.</i>

403
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:47,141
<i>The carrot went in strong
and came out soft.</i>

404
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:50,378
<i>The egg was fragile
and came out hard.</i>

405
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,465
But the coffee beans
changed the water itself."

406
00:26:58,137 --> 00:27:00,888
You're supposed to want
to be the coffee beans.

407
00:27:04,227 --> 00:27:06,794
<i>See, to me, coffee
was just a thing</i>

408
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:08,563
<i>that my boss would drink up.</i>

409
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:10,631
<i>No matter how many times
I refilled his damn cup,</i>

410
00:27:10,633 --> 00:27:13,434
<i>it was just never enough.</i>

411
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,741
<i>I was at work when
the Army took over DC.</i>

412
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:23,995
We weren't allowed to leave.

413
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:27,615
They had to evacuate all the
important people first...

414
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:31,502
members of Congress,
government employees.

415
00:27:31,504 --> 00:27:34,422
So I was stuck with my boss.

416
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:36,841
Not my family...

417
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:41,646
my husband, my four girls...

418
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:48,853
(sniffles)

419
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:55,509
My boss was weak and stupid
and he was going to die

420
00:27:55,511 --> 00:27:58,012
and he was going
to take me down, too.

421
00:27:58,014 --> 00:28:00,865
He was the first person I killed

422
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:02,883
so that I could live.

423
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,455
I stopped counting
when I hit double digits.

424
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:10,458
That's right around the time
I stopped feeling bad about it.

425
00:28:12,462 --> 00:28:14,679
I am not like you.

426
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:19,684
I'm still me, but better.

427
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:23,020
I lost everything
and it made me stronger.

428
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:24,889
You sure about that?

429
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:26,691
I'm alive.

430
00:28:26,693 --> 00:28:29,143
With those people,
those killers.

431
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:31,145
<i>Your people are killers, Carol.</i>

432
00:28:31,147 --> 00:28:34,198
That makes you a killer.

433
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:49,246
You... you're the one.

434
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:51,198
Excuse me?

435
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,884
You're the one
who's afraid to die.

436
00:28:53,886 --> 00:28:56,671
And you're going to.

437
00:28:56,673 --> 00:29:00,174
You will die.

438
00:29:01,966 --> 00:29:04,729
It's what's gonna happen
if you don't work this out.

439
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:09,850
Are you going to kill me?

440
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:14,739
I hope not.

441
00:29:22,023 --> 00:29:26,793
- <i>(static hissing)</i>
- Asshole, are you there?

442
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:28,795
Rick on radio:
<i>I'm here.</i>

443
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,551
We've thought about it.
We want to make the trade.

444
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:36,970
Rick:
<i>That's good.</i>

445
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:40,724
There's a large field with a
sign that says "God is dead"

446
00:29:40,726 --> 00:29:44,011
about two miles
down I-66.

447
00:29:44,013 --> 00:29:46,730
Good visibility
in all directions.

448
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:49,700
Rick: <i>We'll meet you there.
10 minutes?</i>

449
00:29:50,903 --> 00:29:52,319
10 minutes.

450
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:59,493
Mm-mm.
Now, that was too easy.

451
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:02,162
Maybe they're just itching
to get their people back.

452
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:04,164
Paula: <i>No, there was no static.
There should've been static.</i>

453
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,216
<i>They're close.
They're probably already here.</i>

<i>We were careful,
but there were tracks.</i>

- <i>There had to be.</i>
- No...

456
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:11,338
They killed everybody back home.
They have the weapons.

457
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,723
They know what they're doing.

458
00:30:12,725 --> 00:30:14,558
They're probably
waiting to kill us

459
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,059
as soon as we walk
out those doors.

460

You have to listen
to me, please.

462
00:30:24,103 --> 00:30:26,937
Rick is a man of his word.

463
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:29,856
He wouldn't put me and
Maggie at risk to attack.

464
00:30:29,858 --> 00:30:33,026
Then he's just
