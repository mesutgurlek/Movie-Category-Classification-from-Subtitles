00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,109
Narrator: <i>This chapter
was the reason</i>

2
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:22,781
<i>we started looking into
this phenomenon...</i>

3
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:26,618
<i>And to collect evidence
throughout history...</i>

4
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,425
<i>The scriptures...</i>

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,401
<i>And old paintings...</i>

6
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,742
<i>Archeology.</i>

7
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:56,548
<i>There were signs everywhere,</i>

8
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,685
<i>but no one really saw it coming.</i>

9
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,687
<i>These days...</i>

10
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,390
<i>People can't see
when they are preaching hatred.</i>

11
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:11,530
People can't hear when the gods
<i>are fighting each other.</i>

12
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:18,270
<i>And eventually it all
comes down to this city,</i>

13
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:23,675
<i>where there is so much hatred,
it runs deep into the ground,</i>

14
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,844
<i>waking up the dead.</i>

15
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:32,184
<i>In 1972,
two priests from Jerusalem</i>

16
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:36,321
<i>managed to capture this event.</i>

17
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,524
<i>It was the first
profound evidence.</i>

18
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,618
Three stars. That's when
the yom kippur just started.

19
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,323
<i>The church got information
about a local family.</i>

20
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,959
La familiae, Jewish, Muslim?

21
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,295
- Jewish.
- Jewish.

22
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,664
- Are you filming this?
- It's very important.

23
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,935
<i>They say it's a woman
and that she came back.</i>

24
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:24,503
Excuse me, sir,

25
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,806
can you tell the camera
exactly what happened?

26
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:30,409
That thing is not my wife.

27
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,712
<i>She died of typhus
three days before</i>

28
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,382
<i>and was buried near golgotha.</i>

29
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,984
<i>While they were mourning,</i>

30
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,953
<i>on the third night of the Shiva,</i>

31
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:45,424
<i>the child heard
a knock on the door.</i>

32
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,793
<i>At the beginning,
she was quiet and calm,</i>

33
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,828
<i>but then she became violent.</i>

34
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,297
She hurt my father.

35
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:01,406
Representatives from all three
religions are here.

36
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,542
This concerns all of us.

37
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,751
<i>They all believed
in different gods,</i>

38
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,653
<i>but on that night,</i>

39
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:19,458
<i>they were all dealing
with the same devil.</i>

40
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,029
<i>For hours, they tried
to help her, cure her.</i>

41
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,473
<i>But evil was too strong
in that woman.</i>

42
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:36,375
Go closer, quickly.

43
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,944
<i>They had no other choice.</i>

44
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,561
In the name of the lord,
return to the ground!

45
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:08,307
<i>They say there are
three gates to hell.</i>

46
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,810
<i>On that night...</i>

47
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,079
<i>We found one of them.</i>

48
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,762
- Sarahl: Dad!
- Dad: Huh?

49
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,665
I can't believe you.
Oh, my god, no way.

50
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,801
- What do you think?
- You got me a smart glass?

51
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,003
- Oh, my god.
- You like it?

52
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:41,707
Dad, I can't believe you.
Wait.

53
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,676
Look, I've already signed you in
with your user name.

54
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,878
- Did I put it on right?
- You look great in them.

55
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,815
- Oh, it's so cool!
- It is cool.

56
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:51,616
Dad, you're unbelievable.

57
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,385
This is the touchpad,

58
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:56,421
and you navigate with
your finger like a mouse,

59
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,591
and this is the memory card.

60
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,927
I got you
your prescription glasses,

61
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,529
so basically you're all set.

62
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,768
- It makes me look geeky, right?
- What do you expect?

63
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,104
You play those video games
all day long.

64
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:14,106
Dad, don't.
Thank you, daddy.

65
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,074
Why don't you try 'em out?

66
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,110
Glass, play music.

67
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:21,046
Dad: Don't be long, all right?

Okay. Glass, open menu.

I'm coming!

102

Dad: I'm happy that Rachel
is taking you on this trip.

103
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,220
You've had a rough year.

104
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,957
- We all did.
- Yeah.

105
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,726
Dad: Oh, here's Rachel.

- Whoo!
- Dad: Hey, rache.

107
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,230
I can't believe it's happening!
We're really going.

108
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,666
- Hi, Mr. Pullman.
- Are your parents home?

109
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,268
No. They're off squandering
my inheritance somewhere.

110
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,338
- Come on, Drake, the bag.
- Sarah: Come on, come on.

111
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,973
- We're in a hurry.
- I'm on it, baby.

112
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,841
Sarah: I thought it was over
between you two.

113
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,176
Drake: Okay, baby.
You're all set.

114
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,978
Oh, my god,
I'm going to miss you.

115
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,147
Rache! Come on, guys,
cut it out.

116
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,848
- Come on. Get into the car.
- I'm gonna miss you so much.

117
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,350
Come on. Rache!

118
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,218
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, sweetie.

119
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,887
- Get in the car already.
- Bye, guys.

120
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,355
- Bye, Sarah.
- Bye, Drake.

121
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,757
Have fun, girls.
Keep it clean.

122
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,793
I can't believe
we're really going!

123
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,995
- Call me when you get there.
- We're going to Tel Aviv!

124
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,731
- Bye!
- Bye, Drake, lousy lay.

125
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm sorry, Mr. Pullman.

126
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,269
- You have fun.
- Thank you, daddy.

127
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,271
- I love you, kid.
- I love you.

128
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,872
Oh, shit, it's almost 2:00.
We gotta go. Come on.

129
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,174
We're gonna be late.
Bye, Mr. Pullman!

130
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,875
- Bye, daddy!
- Thanks for the ride!

131
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,378
Sarah, don't forget
to send me some pictures!

132
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,080
Let's go!

133
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,984
I'm really happy
we're finally doing this.

134
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,885
I think it will be
really good for you.

135
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,121
- What's our seat number again?
- It's here. 15.

136
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:35,200
- Mm-hm.
- Rache, how's he doing?

137
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:38,103
- Rache.
- What?

138
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,740
Okay, so, Sarah and Rachel.

139
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,875
- Yes.
- Yeah.

140
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,677
So, Kevin, where are you from?

141
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,847
I'm from all over.
I travel a lot.

142
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,016
So where have you been to?

143
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,118
Well, I've lost count.

144
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,420
You see, I study anthropology,

145
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:59,157
so I really like traveling,
exploring different cultures,

146
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,959
especially ancient ones.

147
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,896
- Sounds fascinating.
- Wow. That sounds interesting.

148
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,198
I guess that probably
sounds boring to you.

149
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,767
No, no, no, no, really.

150
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,369
It's actually sounds
really cool.

151
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,272
So what are you,
some kind of Indiana Jones?

152
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:17,108
Exactly,
only much better looking.

153
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:24,182
Kevin: That's exactly
what I'm saying.

154
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,317
Every religion calls it
in a different name,

155
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,087
but actually everyone's
talking about the same thing.

156
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,388
Sarah: Cool.

157
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,691
Kevin: In islam,
it's the dark angel.

158
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,426
For Jews, it's golem.

159
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:39,364
And in christianity, it's the
undead or zombies or whatever.

160
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,066
Sarah: Whoa.

161
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,136
Oh, god.
I hate these fuckers.

162
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,171
What was that?

163
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:57,816
Rachel: Israel, here we come.

164
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,417
Sarah: Glass, take a picture.

165
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:06,391
- Here we go.
- Glass, what time is it?

166
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,462
- Holy shit, it's hot.
- Whoa.

167
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:13,298
- We got beach weather.
- Totally.

168
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,200
- Ouch!
- Sorry.

169
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:18,470
Listen, I've got an offer
you can't refuse.

170
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,205
Offering to carry our bags
to Tel Aviv?

171
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,406
That's so sweet of you, Kevin.

172
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,074
Take mine.

173
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,277
It's a very special time
in the holy city.

174
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,046
- Come with me to Jerusalem.
- Jerusalem?

175
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:31,182
- It's gonna be fun.
- Yeah, rache, what do you say?

176
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,918
Will you excuse us for a second?
Just one second.

177
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,453
Sarah, come here a second.

178
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,856
What? What is it?

179
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,424
Oh, my god, you're such a slut.

180
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,092
- What? Why?
- Why?

181
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,796
Just admit you want
a taste of that ass.

182
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,298
And that stupid hat.

183
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,100
- Just admit it.
- Okay, fine.

184
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,369
But come on, rache,
we're just changing the order.

185
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,038
First Jerusalem,
then parties in Tel Aviv, okay?

186
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,343
The whole point of the trip
is to have fun, right?

187
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,412
You just chew it?

188
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,315
It's good.
Make you strong in the bed.

189
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,551
- Take, take.
- Sarah: What is that?

190
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,887
- I've gotta try this.
- Voice command. Call dad.

191
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,488
Kevin, I'm serious.
Don't eat that.

192
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,891
No, no! Shit.

193
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:15,560
It's nice.
It's disgusting!

194
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,195
- Nasty!
- It's bitter.

195
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,897
Whatever, fine.

196
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,365
<i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

197
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,067
Oh, shit. Sorry, dad.
I forgot it was nighttime.

198
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,069
<i>No, it's okay.
I'm glad you called.</i>

199
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,071
<i>Have you landed?
Are you in Tel Aviv?</i>

200
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,840
Actually our plans
are kinda changed.

201
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,408
We're heading to Jerusalem now.

202
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,343
<i>Is that okay?
Should I be worried?</i>

203
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,012
- No.
- Hi, Mr. Pullman!

204
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,046
- <i>Hi.
- No, no, don't worry.</i>

205
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,281
Everything's fine.

206
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,082
Kevin, does that make
your mouth burn?

207
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,084
- My whole mouth is...
- Oh, my god, it's so gross.

208
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,220
- It's disgusting.
- Close your mouth.

209
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:46,324
This is so disgusting.

210
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,227
This is a big big graveyard,
very old.

211
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:52,864
- Got a lot of dead people here.
- A lot.

212
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:56,334
This is the entrance
of the city. A graveyard.

213
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,069
Very symbolic, ah?

214
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,605
You see, we have a beautiful,
beautiful tradition

215
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,473
of killing each other.

216
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,213
Kevin: This is Damascus gate.

217
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:11,516
Oh, wow.

218
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,018
Kevin, we're going straight
to the hostel, right?

219
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,220
Yeah, we are.

220
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,922
Rachel: What are those,
cigarettes?

221
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,461
- Oh, what is that?
- Rache, cool it.

222
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,264
Look at all that. Wow.

223
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,268
Hey, kid.
What do you want?

224
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,604
No, no. Sorry, you can't
have my glasses.

225
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,005
Too expensive.

226
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,506
Rachel:
Look at these these colors.

227
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,609
Look at the little guy
leading the way.

228
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,110
Where are we going, little guy?

229
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,012
Hey, buddy, wait up.

230
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,248
Kevin: I don't know. It was
supposed to be here somewhere.

231
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,083
Glass, open navigation.

232
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,620
Okay, take a right.

233
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,361
Keep walking.

234
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,463
I love America!

235
00:14:58,465 --> 00:14:59,631
- Just ignore him.
- Keep walking.

236
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:03,167
I am David.
King David.

237
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,404
If you need guide,
I am your man.

238
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,239
The best in the town.

239
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,607
- No, thanks, we're good.
- We're fine.

240
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,010
Oh, my god.
Is he for real?

241
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:16,114
- God, the heat is killing me.
- I feel old.

242
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,349
- I think it's here.
- This place?

243
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:21,085
- Yeah, this is it.
- Watch your head.

244
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,688
Seems like people
used to be smaller.

245
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,428
Unbelievable.

246
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,562
- Wow.
- Whoa.

247
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,465
- Hey, guys.
- Cheers, mate.

248
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,667
Let's go up.

249
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:37,435
- Heaven!
- Totally.

250
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,070
Let's go.

251
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,507
Glass, take a picture.

252
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,342
- Cute ass.
- What?

253
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,644
What? Nothing, nothing.

254
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,649
- Hey.
- Hello.

255
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,018
- Salam alaikum.
- Hello.

256
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,187
Welcome.
Welcome, my friends.

257
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,256
Sit, please.
I'll be right with you.

258
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,324
Thank you.

259
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:01,225
Omar! We have a guest.

260
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,094
- I'm coming!
- Omar!

261
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,163
Glass, take a picture.

262
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Oh, my god.

263
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,569
Told you this place is nice.

264
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,138
Yeah, looks amazing.

265
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,708
Hello, sir.

266
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,279
I'm sorry.
I don't speak...

267
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:25,016
grandfather says you bring
the smell of innocence.

268
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,617
Thanks, I think.

269
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,020
Oh, my god. I'm so thirsty.
You don't mind, do you?

270
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,121
Thanks.

271
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,056
Jesus, my feet hurt.

272
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,058
Oh, god, rache.
No, don't do that.

273
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,229
Sarah: What did he say?

274
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,165
She brings the smell of feet
after two weeks in the desert.

275
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,234
Thanks.

276
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:46,137
You two are very, very
beautiful, but this I say.

277
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,473
- Cold lemonade. I squeeze.
- Thanks.

278
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,208
Actually it's
the very high season now

279
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,510
so you'll need to be
in the room upstairs.

280
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,246
Actually they are much better
because of the view.

281
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,282
It's 100 shekels each,
but you get free Wi-Fi.

282
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:00,251
Sarah: Bye, Kevin.

283
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:01,619
- See you later.
- See you later.

284
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,621
- Sure.
- Bye.

285
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,189
What?

286
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,592
And because you two
are so beautiful,

287
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:11,429
I upgraded you to the ultra
premium turbo deluxe suite.

288
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,131
- Wait and see.
- Sweet!

289
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,633
- Yes! All right.
- Voila!

290
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,802
What?

291
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,438
Are you kidding me?

292
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,075
- You like?
- This is your premium suite?

293
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:26,344
- Thank you, Omar.
- Yeah, thank you, Omar.

294
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,613
Your hostel is, well, lovely.

295
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,215
- What is this?
- A tip.

296
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,051
Ah. No way, Jose.

297
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,654
But if you insist, I will let
you buy Omar a beer tonight.

298
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:41,292
Okay, well, only if you take us
to a really, really cool place.

299
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,528
But only if you dance with Omar.

300
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,331
Sure, but only if Omar promises
to get us the best hash in town.

301
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,068
Ah, you will wait and see.

302
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,404
Omar will give you...
Party time.

303
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,839
- Party time?
- What?

304
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,474
Enjoy your stay!

305
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,709
Thank you!

306
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,079
Oh, god.

307
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,713
Oh, my god.
This is hysterical.

308
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,716
- Oh, my god, I'm so tired.
- Me too.

309
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,619
Maybe just a quick nap and
then we're off to hit the town

310
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:10,822
with your new blond boyfriend.

311
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,470
Glass, what time is it?

312
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:26,604
Rache?

313
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,108
Rache?

314
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,485
Rache?

315
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,388
Kevin?

316
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,392
Where is everybody?

317
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:53,631
♪

318
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,477
Kevin?

319
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,246
Rache?

320
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,891
Excuse me, sir.

321
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,793
Sir?

322
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,533
Oh, god. Hi.

323
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,535
Hi, pretty one.

324
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,570
He plays so beautifully.

325
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,173
He plays to calm down
the demons.

326
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,908
The bad spirits.

327
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,277
Bad spirits? Wow.

328
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,480
We have a lot
of superstitions here.

329
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:44,182
Do you believe?

330
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:48,519
Me? No. I'm old school.
I believe in science.

331
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,855
You are stupid...

332
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,657
But beautiful.

333
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,294
Excuse me?

334
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,962
That was weird.

335
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,932
Woman in abaya: Hey. Pssst!

336
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,333
Come.

337
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,734
Sarah: Can I help you?

338
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:05,570
Woman: Come.

339
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,271
- What?
- This way.

340
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,440
- Your friend is in trouble.
- What did you say?

341
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,775
- Your friend is in trouble.
- My friend?

342
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:14,312
What happened to her? Hey!

343
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,981
- Hey, come back here.
- Hurry.

344
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,883
- Where is she?
- This way.

345
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,551
What?

346
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,554
Wait a minute.

347
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,361
Hey.

348
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,963
Pssst!

349
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,465
- Will you stop for a minute?
- Come!

350
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:36,567
- What?
- This way. Hurry.

351
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,740
Hurry. Come on.
This way.

352
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,713
What do you want?

353
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,618
To do the funky chicken dance.

354
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,819
What?

355
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,322
What the...

356
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,757
what the fuck?

357
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,659
- Oh, my god!
- Rache!

358
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,261
You should have seen your face!

359
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:04,562
Oh, my god, I'll kill you,
you bitch.

360
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,364
- You scared the hell out of me.
- Come on!

361
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,399
- How long can you sleep?
- Rachel, slow down a second.

362
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,334
You have no idea.
This place is crazy.

363
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,504
We're right next to the market,
and there's a ton of cool shit.

364
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,473
Okay.

365
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,841
Are you ready?

366
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,643
- Oh, wow.
- Check it out.

367
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,444
- No way.
- I know!

368
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,713
Look where we are!
It's insane.

369
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:25,549
- Oh, my god.
- Kevin: Sarah! Come join us.

370
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,985
- Isn't it crazy?
- It's amazing.

371
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,887
Not bad, ah?

372
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,622
You can see everything
from here.

373
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,557
This is temple northern al-aqsa.

374
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,359
Next to it is
the Armenian quarter.

375
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,594
This is the Jewish quarter.

376
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,496
And we are in
the Muslim quarter.

377
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,931
A church next to a synagogue,
next to a temple,

378
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,400
all stuck together.

379
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,701
No wonder you all
hate each other.

380
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:44,735
Sarah!

381
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,837
Well?

382
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,639
What do you say, white boy?

383
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,809
This Lebanon hashish not the
poopoo stuff you smoke America.

384
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,882
Man, I smoked some shit
in my life,

385
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:59,317
but this is something else.

386
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,552
Hey, but take it slowly.

387
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,622
I don't want you to go in
the flip side, okay, white boy?

388
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:07,091
♪

389
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,362
Come on!
Shake it, Sarah.

390
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:14,031
Just one more puff.

391
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,900
Come on, shake it.
There you go.

392
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,469
- There you go.
- Shake that ass.

393
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,340
Kevin: Shit, I'm stoned.

394
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,577
Rachel: So where are we
going now?

395
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:30,614
Omar: Well, I think someone
owes me a drink.

396
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:33,984
Kevin: Wait. Aren't you muslims
not allowed to drink alcohol?

397
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:36,654
Omar: Everybody has
his own score with Allah.

398
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,824
- But don't tell my father, ah?
- Don't worry.

399
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,026
Get ready! Omar is taking you
party tonight!

400
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,561
Jerusalem style!

401
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,529
Rachel: Ooh, Jerusalem style.

402
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,798
Hey, guys, wait up.
I'm just taking a picture.

403
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,601
- See. Omar?
- Glass, take picture.

404
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:53,838
Hey! Hey!

405
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Hey!

406
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:59,910
Come back here!
Come back here!

407
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:03,714
Give me my bag!

408
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,016
Shit!

409
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,652
Shit!

410
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:11,756
Stop! Stop!

411
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:13,791
Come back here, little shit!

412
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:20,064
Help!
Come back here, you fucker!

413
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,168
Fuck!

414
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:36,547
Oh, my god.

415
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,948
Ohh...

416
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,990
Fuck you, asshole!

417
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,035
Oh, my god. Shit.

418
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,107
I can't believe that fucker
stole my bag.

419
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:06,610
Okay, enough with the sour face.
Come on, what's up with you?

420
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,079
You left the passport here,
so everything's cool, okay?

421
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,614
We have a shitload of cash

422
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,949
and the credit card I swiped
from my dad,

423
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,584
so what are you worried about?

424
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,619
I just left my prescription
glasses in there.

425
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,855
Now I'm stuck wearing
these things.

426
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:19,690
Okay, lady,
you've bitched enough.

427
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:22,693
- Come on, it's selfie time.
- Okay.

428
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:25,463
Just a little touch
for Mr. Indiana.

429
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,131
Rache, what are you doing?
Cut it out.

430
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:28,999
Well, come on. It's bad enough
you're lugging around

431
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,768
those disgusting glasses
everywhere we go.

432
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,871
Let's at least get Kevin
look where we want him to.

433
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,706
Perfect! Okay.
I'll take a picture of us.

434
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,041
Okay.

435
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:41,712
Here we go. Okay.
One for us.

436
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,247
All right.

437
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,516
And now one for instgram,

438
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:48,085
so Drake lazy-lay
can get a little jealous.

439
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:49,553
Mmm!

440
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,225
Now let's hit the city
Jerusalem style.

441
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:56,927
Jerusalem style.

442
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,663
Rachel: Hey, guys.

443
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,165
Hello!

444
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,169
What is that?

445
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,005
Omar: They say there was
a murder in the old city.

446
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,940
But it's bullshit.

447
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,812
What happened?

448
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,580
It's nothing. It's, uh...

449
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,182
It's nothing, it's a...

450
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,783
Baa baaa!

451
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,185
What?

452
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,720
Lamb, lamb.

453
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,221
- A lamb?
- Yes!

454
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:27,024
Somebody threw blood on the wall
and everybody goes...

455
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,926
Cuckoo-ruckoo.

456
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:32,830
Okay, but it's still safe
to go outside though, isn't it?

457
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:35,766
Yes, of course.
Let's go.

458
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,701
Nothing. You are tourists.

459
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,770
You are walking wallets.
Everybody loves you.

460
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:40,804
Let's go.

461
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,108
Omar: Oh! King David.

462
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:51,048
Listen, you must leave
before yom kippur.

463
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,551
- Why?
- No one believe me,

464
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,553
but now they will see.

465
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,922
They will all see.

466
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,123
See what?

467
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,325
But this time, I ready for them.

468
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:03,127
What are you talking about?

469
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:06,830
It worked with goliath,
and it will work now.

470
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:08,666
Okay, king David.

471
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,834
- I have to go now.
- We are going also.

472
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,336
They are looking for me.

473
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,338
They are looking for us, too,
in the club. Thank you.

474
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,907
- It's okay.
- Just be careful.

475
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,309
- What's his story?
- It's sad.

476
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,010
He's loco-loco, this guy.

477
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:22,346
This is the place. Come.

478
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:23,781
Watch your step.

479
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:25,883
- This is perfect.
- Yes!

480
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:28,218
Nice.

481
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,187
Oh, wow.

482
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:33,023
We're here in

Are you two really Jewish?

Yeah, as Jewish as they come.

excuse me.

549
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,054
Sir, excuse me,
do you know where...

550
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,025
oh, great timing, dad.

551
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,094
Not now.

552
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,265
Shit.

553
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,036
Where the fuck am I?

554
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,115
Come on.

555
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,989
Shit.

556
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,260
Man: Hey!

557
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,464
Wait!

558
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,466
Hey, it's me.

559
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:45,102
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

560
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,307
Listen, I'm sorry about
what I said.

561
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,110
It's not your fault.
It's okay.

562
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:56,113
Guy in the picture
was my brother.

563
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,382
He died in an accident
a year ago and...

564
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,923
What is it?

565
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:09,493
No. Nothing.
I thought I heard something.

566
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:12,062
Listen, I'm sorry
about your brother.

567
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:14,097
- I didn't mean to...
- no, it's cool.

568
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,167
I just need to try
and move on with my life.

569
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,170
That's the reason
rache dragged me on this trip.

570
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:24,274
- Take me back to the hostel.
- Yeah, sure.

571
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:33,083
I'm gonna drink a few gallons
of water and pass out.

572
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,451
You have a nice hangover.

573
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,554
Good night, Indiana.
Thanks for rescuing me.

574
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,556
Pleasure was all mine.

575
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,196
Hey, Kevin.

576
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:48,665
Yeah?

577
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,105
Let's take that off.

578
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:17,260
- Do me, Indiana.
- Come here.

579
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,311
Sarah: Hey.

580
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,414
Kevin?

581
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,120
Hey, what's up?

582
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,264
What's the matter?

583
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,233
Jet lag?

584
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:59,803
Some strange noises I heard
woke me up.

585
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,706
Voices?
What are you talking about?

586
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,208
More like distant screams.

587
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,680
I'm not making any sense, am I?

588
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:13,683
Will you please tell me
what's going on?

589
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:21,391
There's something
I want to show you.

590
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,627
I'm sending you the link.

591
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:25,462
Kevin, you're freaking me out.

592
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:28,465
I found it on the darknet,
doing my research.

593
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:31,368
Just watch it.

594
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,736
Okay.

595
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:36,273
Glass, open link.

596
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:39,276
They say it's from
the Vatican's archives.

597
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:46,550
<i>Representatives from all three
religions are here.</i>

598
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,618
<i>It concerns all of us.</i>

599
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:07,137
<i>In the name of the lord,
return to the ground!</i>

600
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,349
You know this thing is
total bullshit, right?

601
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:20,684
Yeah, I guess so.

602
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:22,452
Okay, so let me see
if I got this straight.

603
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,254
You think that in this city,

604
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:26,523
people are just coming back
from the dead all the time,

605
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:29,359
- like coming out of the ground?
- No, not all the time.

606
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,661
According to what I read,
it happened here before.

607
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,263
More than once.

608
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,198
So how come
nobody's talking about it?

609
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,501
Maybe all the religious leaders
know something,

610
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,369
and they keep it a secret.

611
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,837
Kevin, come on. Why?

612
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:43,874
Maybe they know something
that we don't.

613
00:35:43,876 --> 00:35:48,411
Maybe the resurrection
is gonna happen again.

614
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:52,549
The undead, the dark angels,
the nephilim.

615
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,484
Just like it says in the Bible.

616
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:57,187
- Which Bible?
- All of them.

617
00:35:57,189 --> 00:35:59,723
Okay, Kevin, it's late

618
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:03,627
and you're freaking me out with
your apocalypse theory, so...

619
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:06,863
yeah. It's probably
crazy talk.

620
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:09,232
It's stupid. Never mind.

621
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:13,336
It's okay, it's cool.
Just get some sleep, Indiana.

622
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,671
Yeah.

623
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,177
Good night.

624
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,368
Glass, close link.

625
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,705
Omar!

626
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,308
It's "good morning" in arabic.

627
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:54,844
Sabbach-whatever
to you too.

628
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,714
Judging by that smile, I see
it was a good night as well.

629
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,517
Aywa.
That's "yes" in arabic.

630
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,452
I figured.

631
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:03,853
There you are, you naughty girl.

632
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:06,356
- Good morning, Princess.
- Good morning.

633
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:08,358
Where did you
disappear to last night?

634
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,728
Come on, I want to hear
everything.

635
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:17,467
Okay, I go.
Squeeze lemonade.

636
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,571
Well?

637
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,442
Well, well, um...

638
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:28,278
Let's just say that
lightning struck last night.

639
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,512
Several times.

640
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,448
What about you,
Mrs. Jones?

641
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,716
Uh...

642
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,985
No way. Oh, my god!

643
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:38,688
Somebody's finally starting
to go with the flow!

644
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,724
No!

645
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,801
- It's gone, it's nothing.
- My dad's gonna kill me.

646
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:54,904
I didn't scratch it.
Just try it on.

647
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:57,007
- Rache...
- It's gone.

648
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,508
- I think it's broken.
- Let's go.

649
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,012
It's not working right.

650
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:04,514
Today Omar takes you
for sightseeing in the old city.

651
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:05,882
We'll start at the market,

652
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,984
and then we'll go
to the Armenian quarter,

653
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,753
and then we'll go
to the Jewish quarter

654
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,688
and finish with the great...

655
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,528
- opa.
- Hey.

656
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,832
Hello, good morning, neighbor.
Hello.

657
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:26,303
- Glass, take a picture.
- You like what you see?

658
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,341
Omar: I hate these assholes.

659
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:32,942
Rachel: Really? They seem nice.

660
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,045
You Americans are so naïve.

661
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,614
But you know how to party.

662
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:40,583
Sarah: Kevin, what's up?

663
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:42,986
What is this place?

664
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:45,388
Omar: This?

665
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,357
You don't want to come here,
believe me.

666
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,960
This is, eh...
How you say?

667
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:53,930
- A cuckoo house.
- Sarah: A cuckoo house?

668
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:57,100
- What, like a mental asylum?
- Yes, for people who go crazy.

669
00:38:57,102 --> 00:39:00,337
There's a lot here in the city
like this.

670
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:02,405
A lot of tourists come here,

671
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,107
they see their own eyes
what they read in the Bible,

672
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:06,109
and they go cuckoo-ruckoo.

673
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:08,378
Kevin: You mean
Jerusalem syndrome?

674
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,415
Yes. This city can bring
a lot of madness for the people.

675
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,616
Let's go.

676
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,585
Sarah, look at me.

677
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,420
Oh, wow.

678
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,690
Pretty.

679
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,826
"Don't worry, be Jewish."

680
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:25,528
Sarah: I'm so getting that one
for my dad.

681
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,796
See?

682
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,098
What's that?

683
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,733
Omar: This is where we pray.

684
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:32,402
Sarah: No way. That's amazing.

685
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:37,006
They're all praying?
They always pray here.

686
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,108
Kevin: Nice dress.

687
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,077
Yeah, very.

688
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:43,713
I'm gonna check how much it is.

689
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,715
No. Kevin, stop.

690
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,685
Don't worry. I got this.

691
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:51,955
You Jews wear white
on yom kippur, right?

692
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,691
Now you have something to wear.

693
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:56,393
Thanks, Indiana.

694
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,433
- Rache!
- Is this real leather?

695
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:05,168
Wow.

696
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,736
Sarah, you're gonna get lost.
Come on.

697
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,105
Okay, okay.

698
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:13,143
- Smells like something.
- You smell perfect.

699
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,021
Rache, I don't think you're
allowed to do that here.

700
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,122
Put it in your bag.

701
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,992
Western wall.

702
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:31,027
This is the holiest place
in Israel.

703
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,763
- Better give it some respect.
- All right, all right.

704
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,132
Rache, you know I don't believe
in that nonsense.

705
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:37,934
Just give it a chance.

706
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:41,738
Just write down your deepest
and strongest wishes, okay?

707
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,119
All right. Here it is.

708
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:59,889
Nothing special.
Just world peace.

709
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,791
Hope we're good.

710
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,693
Whoa.

711
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:06,729
What the hell?

712
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,932
- What the hell?
- What the fuck?

713
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:14,237
That was creepy.
Let's get out of here.

714
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,941
What is this place?

715
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:19,776
Come on, let's go.
Come on, come on.

716
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:24,047
Guide: Welcome to
king Solomon's quarries,

717
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:28,585
the biggest artificial cave
in the middle east.

718
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,687
- Omar: Take helmet.
- Guide: Please, everybody,

719
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:35,225
take a helmet
and turn on the headlights.

720
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:37,961
You know that these are
the exact same flashlights

721
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:42,599
that were used by king Solomon's
diggers a thousand years ago.

722
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:48,505
- Guide okay.
- Sarah: That wasn't funny.

723
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:54,878
King Solomon was...

724
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,615
Bla bla bla.
Bla bla bla.

725
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:03,653
- Boo!
- Rache! Stop doing that!

726
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,021
Yeah, I'm a retard, I know.

727
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:07,957
Woman: Excuse me,
I have a question.

728
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,997
Sarah: Hey, Kevin.

729
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,999
Is everything okay?

730
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:19,168
Yeah, I'm fine. Sure.
Let's go.

731
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,306
This just keeps going
deeper and deeper.

732
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:25,675
This is insane.

733
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,749
Kevin?

734
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,784
Kev? Indiana?

735
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:36,019
Kevin: I'm here.

736
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,988
Hey. There you are.

737
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,124
What is that?

738
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:58,241
Guide: You can see the peephole,
the eye peek.

739
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:02,946
There are plenty more like this
all around here.

740
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:05,181
Kevin: This guy is really
starting to bug me.

741
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:07,850
- Can we get out now?
- Yeah, sure. We're almost done.

742
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:09,319
Guide: Researchers
are still arguing

743
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,154
what these holes are for.

744
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:12,789
Some say it's for...

745
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,726
Sarah: What's wrong?

746
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:19,295
I'm suffocating in here.
I can't breathe.

747
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:22,999
Oh, my god. It's okay.
Come on, it's okay.

748
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:25,368
- Hey, are you good, white boy?
- Yeah, yeah, you guys go on.

749
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,236
- We're fine.
- Are you sure?

750
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,105
Yeah, yeah. We're just gonna
go out for some air, okay?

751
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,974
We'll meet you
back at the hostel.

752
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:32,875
Come on, Kevin.
Everything's okay.

753
00:43:32,877 --> 00:43:34,877
I'll take you outside.

754
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,081
- It's okay.
- Kevin: Come on, Sarah.

755
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:41,284
- Everything's okay.
- No, it's not.

756
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,786
I'm going to the city archives
to check the books.

757
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,623
Kevin.
Kevin, wait for me.

758
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,992
- Hey, Kevin!
- Something's not right.

759
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:51,894
Hey, wait up!
Hey, Kevin!

760
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:54,697
Oh, god.
That cave was insane, wasn't it?

761
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:56,165
Yeah, it was nice.

762
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,400
Too bad you guys weren't there
waiting for us.

763
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:59,769
Omar took us to the best
hummus place.

764
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:02,305
Kevin needed some air.
I'm really worried about him.

765
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:05,742
Listen, rache, I think we got
Jerusalem covered.

766
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:07,777
I mean, I was talking to Kevin,

767
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:09,379
and we're thinking of going
to Tel Aviv tomorrow night.

768
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:10,847
What do you think?

769
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,882
Why? The vacation's
just beginning.

770
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,217
Are you serious?

771
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:16,185
Now I want to stay,
and you want to go?

772
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:19,789
Rache, there's something weird
about this place.

773
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,125
Or maybe you two are developing
Jerusalem syndrome,

774
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:25,294
- and you are going crazy.
- Fuck you, rache, I'm serious.

775
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:29,232
Oh, god, Sarah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm kidding,

776
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:31,200
it's my bad joke.
I'm sorry.

777
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:33,269
Okay.

778
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:36,172
Look, the whole city's
shut down now anyway, okay?

779
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,808
So the second yom kippur
is over, we're outta here.

780
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,843
Promise? Hmm?

781
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,354
Kevin: Sarah, Rachel, open up!

782
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,423
Rachel: Sarah, what's going on
out there?

783
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:56,726
You have to pack now!
We have to leave!

784
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:58,995
Sarah: Why? What happened?
I don't understand.

785
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:00,430
Kevin, listen to me.
Everything's gonna be fine.

786
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:02,131
We're gonna go to Tel Aviv
tomorrow night.

787
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:04,067
There's not gonna be
tomorrow night!

788
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:05,935
- What are you talking about?
- I know you think I'm crazy.

789
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:08,204
Something bad is happening
here, Sarah! Pack up!

790
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,972
Kevin! Kevin don't!

791
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:13,009
- Rachel: What the fuck?!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

792
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,911
Kevin!

793
00:45:14,913 --> 00:45:17,413
You have to believe me
'cause they won't.

794
00:45:17,415 --> 00:45:19,816
Sarah: I don't understand
what you're talking about.

795
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,884
Omar, fauzi, everything's okay.
I got this.

796
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:24,921
Kevin: Sarah, tell them to go.

797
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:27,857
Listen, Kevin, everything's
gonna be fine, okay?

798
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:29,759
Just calm down.

799
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:31,894
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

800
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,831
Kevin: Sarah, listen to me!

801
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,999
- We have to leave!
- Were there any signs before?

802
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:39,135
It's important
for you to remember.

803
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:41,037
Sarah: I don't know.
He just started talking funny,

804
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,140
and then all of a sudden...
i don't know. I don't know.

805
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:45,875
Everything will be okay.
Don't worry.

806
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:47,343
Kevin: Get your hands off me!

807
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,445
- Kevin, my friend, come.
- No, no, no, no!

808
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:52,281
Sarah: Hey, fauzi, stop.

809
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:54,917
Hey, guys, where are you
taking him?

810
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:57,520
Omar: Come with us. Don't worry.
Everything will be okay.

811
00:45:57,522 --> 00:46:00,923
Come, come.
Watch the steps. Come.

812
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,500
Are you okay, ladies?

813
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,511
We have a saying here:

814
00:46:21,513 --> 00:46:23,880
"If you're talking to god,
it's good.

815
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:27,483
But if god is talking to you,
then you have problem."

816
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:29,519
- Where have they taken him?
- Don't worry.

817
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:32,822
He will rest a few days,
and he will be as good as new.

818
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:36,826
That's what usually happens
to people who go.

819
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,427
It's not the first time
it's happened here, is it?

820
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:43,866
No. This happens a lot here,
especially to catholics.

821
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:46,402
Go figure.

822
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:50,473
Anyway, I see you later,
ladies? Hmm?

823
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,944
Don't worry.
He will be just fine.

824
00:46:54,946 --> 00:46:56,379
Rachel: The second yom kippur
is over,

825
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:58,147
we're on the first bus
out of this place.

826
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,850
- We're restarting this trip.
- What about Kevin?

827
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:02,919
You heard what Omar said.
He's gonna be fine.

828
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:05,021
Just give him a couple of days.
He's gonna be as good as new.

829
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:06,522
Don't worry.

830
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:08,057
Okay.

831
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:10,059
Okay. Let's go get some rest.

832
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:11,494
It's judgment day tonight,

833
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:14,096
and god knows I've got
a lot of sins to redeem.

834
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,236
Listen, I'll meet you
back at the room, okay?

835
00:47:20,238 --> 00:47:21,571
Okay.

836
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:11,621
What the fuck?

837
00:48:11,623 --> 00:48:16,659
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

838
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,966
Rache, rache, there's
something bad is going on.

839
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:26,335
- What are you talking about?
- I think we need to leave.

840
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:28,371
- Yes, Sarah, we said that.
- Right now!

841
00:48:28,373 --> 00:48:29,672
Sarah!

842
00:48:29,674 --> 00:48:32,408
Let's get out of here.

843
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,410
Yeah, okay, let's go.

844
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,178
I'm gonna find out what that is.

845
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,990
Rachel: Omar!

846
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:50,026
Omar, what's happening?
What's that noise?

847
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:51,994
Omar: Calm down, calm down.

848
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:54,196
<i>Omar, what's going on?</i>

849
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:04,240
Sarah: Omar, what's he saying?
Omar, what's going on?

850
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:07,276
Something about
a terrorist attack or something.

851
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,978
Many dead.

852
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,479
My god.

853
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,248
Glass, open news channel.

854
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:15,217
Reporter: <i>Clearly something
very terrible going on</i>

855
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:16,719
<i>throughout the old city
of Jerusalem here,</i>

856
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:19,522
<i>as we see security forces,
police and army</i>

857
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:22,291
<i>rushing from place to place.

daddy!

859
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,063
<i>Hi, sweetheart.
Are you okay?</i>

860
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:28,731
<i>I heard something happened
in Jerusalem.</i>

861
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:30,466
<i>- Is everything all right?
- </i> I'm scared.

862
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:35,271
Omar: Okay, listen, listen.

863
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:38,107
The best thing will be to stay
here and wait for instructions.

864
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:44,580
What is that?

865
00:49:50,188 --> 00:49:51,487
Sarah, stop.

866
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,302
Omar, what's happening?

867
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,107
Sarah: Yehuda.

868
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,747
Rachel: What's happening?

869
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,320
What are they saying?

870
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:28,591
Sarah: Yehuda, Yehuda, Yehuda,
what's happening?

871
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:32,194
Listen, everybody, everybody!
Hello! Thank you very much!

872
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:35,197
Go back to your room!
It's all okay, okay?

873
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,276
- Omar, what's he saying?
- Everybody...

874
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:49,779
They are telling everybody to
leave the old city immediately.

875
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:51,414
What?!

876
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,351
- Move aside.
- Omar!

877
00:50:55,353 --> 00:50:56,685
Where's he going?

878
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:58,587
Somebody please tell me
what the hell is...

879
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:00,423
Mr. fauzi, what's going on?
What are they saying?

880
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:02,491
They say they close
all the gates in old city.

881
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:05,127
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's get the fuck out of here!

882
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:09,098
Sarah: Omar, is that
what I think this is?

883
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:14,737
Okay, okay, okay!
Listen, listen, everybody!

884
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,806
We're taking you out.

885
00:51:16,808 --> 00:51:20,209
Stay close.
We're gonna go fast, okay?

886
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:22,845
- What?
- Yehuda: Come on!

887
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,513
Are we actually running
to the gates?

888
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:27,183
- Rache, what's happening?
- I don't know.

889
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:29,552
Listen, everything
will be just fine.

890
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,526
Kevin: What are they
shooting at?

891
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:39,595
Tomer: We're taking you
to the closest gate, okay?

892
00:51:39,597 --> 00:51:42,164
- Sarah: Oh, my god.
- Everybody get ready to move.

893
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,567
One...

894
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:48,838
Two... three!
Come on, let's go, go, go!

895
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:54,143
Rache!
Rache, wait for me!

896
00:51:57,548 --> 00:51:59,415
- Sarah!
- Chris, where are you?

897
00:51:59,417 --> 00:52:00,583
Come on!

898
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:03,352
- Rache!
- Move it! Move it!

899
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:05,588
- Go faster, Sarah!
- Get the fuck out of my way!

900
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:09,458
Come here!
Let's go this way!

901
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,127
Where are we going?

902
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:12,595
Rache, this is insane.

903
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:14,296
Watch the car!

904
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:18,701
Rache! Wait for me!

905
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:20,236
- Rache!
- Sarah, come on, keep up.

906
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:22,238
- I can't see you.
- Come on.

907
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,207
Go in front of me.

908
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,177
Fuck.

909
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:37,620
Rachel, wait!
Kevin's in there.

910
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:39,822
Yehuda: Why did you stop?
Come on! Let's go.

911
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:41,490
Sarah: A friend is in there.

912
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,559
What are you doing?
Come on, let's go!

913
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:45,628
Sarah, come on!
We gotta get out of the city!

914
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,263
No, no!
We can't leave him!

915
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:49,165
Are you crazy?
They're locking the gates.

916
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:50,699
- We have to go! Keep moving.
- Please, I'm begging you.

917
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:53,636
- Sarah!
- No, we can't leave him!

918
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:55,471
Are you stupid?
We gotta get out of here.

919
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:56,906
No, I'm not leaving him!

920
00:52:56,908 --> 00:52:58,641
Don't worry.
I'll meet you at the gate.

921
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:00,876
Listen to me. Three minutes,
and I'm out of here.

922
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:02,912
- Let's go.
- Okay.

923
00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:04,713
Come on.

924
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:11,287
Whoa.

925
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:16,225
Okay, come on.

926
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,294
- Stay close.
- Okay.

927

928
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:29,572

959
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:24,687
- Yehuda!
- Yehuda...

960
00:55:24,689 --> 00:55:26,455
I'm sorry.

961
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:27,890
Fuck you guys!

962
00:55:27,892 --> 00:55:31,727

963
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:33,729
Kevin?

964
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:35,631
Kevin?

965
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:37,366
Kevin, I'm coming.

966
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,569
Kevin: Sarah?

967
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,005
Kevin, I'm here.

968
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,474
- You came back for me.
- The keys.

969
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:47,376
Where are the keys?

970
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:50,679
Try the main office.
And hurry up!

971
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:52,715
Glass, stop music!

972
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:58,387
Where is it? Okay, okay.

973
00:55:58,389 --> 00:56:01,123
The keys, the keys.

974
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:10,466
Where are the fucking keys?

975
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,455
Keys, keys. The keys.

976
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,862
Oh, my god.

977
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:42,030
Oh, my god.

978
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,767
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

979
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:47,636
Shh.

980
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:51,473
Shh. Shh.

981
00:56:51,475 --> 00:56:54,977
Hey, I know you.

982
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:56,912
America.

983
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,881
Nice girl.

984
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:00,916
How'd you know...
what's going on?

985
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,152
I saw this already.

986
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:07,089
It happened.
It's happened all before.

987
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:10,993
I was a little, a kid.

988
00:57:10,995 --> 00:57:12,928
My mommy died.

989
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:18,600
We buried her
and then she come back.

990
00:57:18,602 --> 00:57:23,071
It started so happy.
I love my mommy.

991
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:25,974
But she wasn't really my mommy.

992
00:57:25,976 --> 00:57:29,978
- She was dark from the inside.
- Oh, my god.

993
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,980
That kid from the video,
that was you.

994
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:33,982
- And then boom!
- Oh, my god.

995
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:36,518
Shh, shh!

996
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,488
I love my mommy.
I love my mommy.

997
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,690
Be quiet. Be quiet, okay?
They'll hear us.

998
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:44,693
- I tried to warn everyone.
- Quiet.

999
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:47,196
And no one listen.
No one listen.

1000
00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:50,999
- David, shut up!
- They say David is not okay.

1001
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:53,836
- David, be quiet.
- No one listen.

1002
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:57,573
- Put me in, in this place.
- Shh!

1003
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:59,875
We have to run now.

1004
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:02,811
We have to run away.
It's all beginning.

1005
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:06,148
They're all coming.
We have to run away now!

1006
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,916
David, come back.

1007
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:11,620
David! Shit, shit!
Oh, my god.

1008
00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:19,761
You'll never catch me!

1009
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,973
Oh, shit.

1010
00:58:30,975 --> 00:58:34,943
Oh, my god.

1011
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,999
Kevin!

1012
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,300
- Kevin!
- Got it?

1013
00:58:58,302 --> 00:59:00,002
- Got it.
- Come on, come on.

1014
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:04,573
Come on.

1015
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,942
I can't do it.
I'm fucking shaking.

1016
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:10,045
Sarah, please, please, please.
Come on, do it.

1017
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,680
Shit!

1018
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:14,883
Sarah, look at me.
Look at me, Sarah.

1019
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,052
You can do it.
You can do it.

1020
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:19,121
We're getting out.
Come on.

1021
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:24,126
Okay, okay, okay.
I got it, I got it.

1022
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:30,198
- I got it, I got it.
- Good, good!

1023
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:34,303
Let's go!
Let's go, Sarah!

1024
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,781
Come on, Sarah!
Let's go!

1025
00:59:51,322 --> 00:59:54,122
Sarah!

1026
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:55,824
- Kevin!
- Where are we going?

1027
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:58,961
- Kevin, go! Go to the gate.
- Where the fuck is it?

1028
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,664
Wait, Kevin.
I think it's left.

1029
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:03,832
- Left?
- Go left.

1030
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:05,000
Wait, wait, wait.

1031
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:13,208
- Let's try the other way.
- No, no, Kevin, Kevin.

1032
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:15,077
That's the fastest way.

1033
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:27,723
Oh, my god.

1034
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:29,791
- Come, come, come with me.
- David, where are you going?

1035
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,828
Look, look! Bikes! Bikes!

1036
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,665
David, do you know the way
to lion's gate?

1037
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:43,839
What the fuck?
Oh, my god.

1038
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,942
The nephilim, the mighty giants.

1039
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:49,311
Oh, we are fucked!

1040
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,847
Ohh!

1041
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,752
- Follow me!
- Okay, come on.

1042
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:01,189
Faster! Faster!

1043
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:03,992
David:
Come on to the lion's gate!

1044
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:07,829
Sarah: Hey, guys, wait up.

1045
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,366
Come on.

1046
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:13,435
We got to go now!

1047
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,176
Sarah!

1048
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:23,945
Sarah!

1049
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,218
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1050
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,788
- Come on.
- Come on.

1051
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:40,162
Kevin, look for Rachel!

1052
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:43,331
Rachel!

1053
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:46,001
Rachel!

1054
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:49,104
Man on megaphone: <i>The whole city
is now under quarantine.</i>

1055
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:51,273
Sarah: Rachel!

1056
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,375
Rachel, where are you?

1057
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:57,145
Kevin: Omar!

1058
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:59,181
Sarah: Omar! Rachel!

1059
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:01,883
- Rache, rache!
- Sarah!

1060
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,952
Rache!

1061
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:05,921
Thank god!
Don't ever leave me again.

1062
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,489
Listen, they're closing
the gates.

1063
01:02:07,491 --> 01:02:09,758
They're not letting anybody
out of the city.

1064
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:12,728
Sarah: It's David.

1065
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:17,799
David!

1066
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:19,801
That's David.

1067
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:21,369
David!

1068
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:23,138
Move out of the way!
Get out of the way!

1069
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,973
Get out of the way!
David!

1070
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:27,476
Man on megaphone: <i>I repeat,
stand back right now!</i>

1071
01:02:27,478 --> 01:02:31,113
- David, go!
<i>- Sir, stand back!</i>

1072
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:33,515
<i>This is your last warning!</i>

1073
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:43,325
Kevin: Move back, move back!

1074
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:45,127
Come on! Go!

1075
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:50,165
Kevin, what do we do?
What do we do now?

1076
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:54,469
Omar.

1077
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:56,004
Let's go and try the Zion gate.

1078
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:57,839
Maybe there will be
less soldiers there.

1079
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:59,941
- Follow us, follow us.
- Come on, come on!

1080
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:02,344
Come on! Come on!

1081
01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:11,820
Sarah: Motherfuckers.

1082
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:14,022
- Fuck you, asshole!
- Rachel: Sarah, come on!

1083
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:15,924
- How could you leave us there?
- Sarah!

1084
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:17,392
It doesn't matter anyway.

1085
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,227
We came here too late,
and we're all fucked.

1086
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:21,029
The city is under siege.

1087
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,564
Fuck off!

1088
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:24,166
Come on. Let's go.

1089
01:03:24,168 --> 01:03:26,034
Tomer: Wait.
Where are you heading?

1090
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:27,836
Kevin: We're going to try
the next gate.

1091
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:29,037
Let's go.

1092
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,040
Tomer: Wait, wait, wait.

1093
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:34,109
We're coming with you.
Wait. Yehuda!

1094
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:36,044
Sarah: Fuck you, asshole!

1095
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:37,445
Wait. Hey!

1096
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:43,919
There. There.

1097
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:52,894
Oh, my god.

1098
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:56,298
Kevin: Holy shit.

1099
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,967
Sarah: Those fuckers can fly?

1100
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,969
Open the door!

1101
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,024
Tomer: Here.

1102
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:50,185
Thanks for not
leaving me back there.

1103
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:52,654
- I owe you one.
- It's cool.

1104
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:55,557
I'll think of something
when we leave this crazy city.

1105
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,195
Don't worry.

1106
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:02,230
We will.

1107
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,132
Yeah.

1108
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,369
Rachel: Can somebody
explain to me, please,

1109
01:05:07,371 --> 01:05:09,905
what the fuck is going on here?

1110
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:11,473
I mean, seriously,
you guys are soldiers.

1111
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:13,942
Why the fuck were they
shooting at you?

1112
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:18,613
Omar: Why don't they let us out?
What are you hiding from us?

1113
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:20,649
- Yehuda: They're afraid.
- Tomer: Not afraid, okay?

1114
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:22,150
We are not afraid.

1115
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:23,985
There's nothing
to be afraid of, okay?

1116
01:05:23,987 --> 01:05:26,154
There are 2,000 soldiers
in this town

1117
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:28,156
with orders and procedures.

1118
01:05:28,158 --> 01:05:30,158
They're trained
for every scenario.

1119
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,327
So don't be afraid, okay?

1120
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:34,329
- Not for this one.
- Yehuda, shut up.

1121
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:38,166
All these things
happening tonight?

1122
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,171
They teach us at school
to be good kids

1123
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:46,408
because on yom kippur,
judgment day...

1124
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:49,110
it's religious bullshit.

1125
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,112
The sky is opening up,

1126
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,315
and god judges everyone,

1127
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:55,717
our sins and our good deeds.

1128
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,986
Sarah: Yehuda, what are you
talking about?

1129
01:05:57,988 --> 01:06:01,156
But it's not the sky
that is opening up tonight.

1130
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:03,325
It's the ground.

1131
01:06:03,327 --> 01:06:06,194
- Sarah: Tomer, that's enough!
- Kevin: Let him talk.

1132
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:09,164
I have no idea
what's happening tonight.

1133
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,732
I just know
I'm shitting my pants.

1134
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:13,201
Tomer: Yehuda!

1135
01:06:13,203 --> 01:06:16,104
Omar:
We all had enough of you.

1136
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:21,509
- Rachel: Cool it, guys.
- Sarah: Stop it, okay?

1137
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:26,448
Omar, please.
Just cut it out, okay?

1138
01:06:28,085 --> 01:06:30,018
Omar: It isn't right
to talk like this.

1139
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,453
My family's here
for 20 generations.

1140
01:06:31,455 --> 01:06:33,455
Guys, cool it.

1141
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:39,694
Calm down!
Hey! Come on!

1142
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:41,730
You shut up, you arab fucker!

1143
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:43,231
Rachel: What?

1144
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:45,500
- Cool it!
- Shut up!

1145
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,107
These glasses are killing me.

1146
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:54,342
I don't think we're gonna
get out of here, rache.

1147
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,177
Hey.

1148
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,445
Stop.

1149
01:06:57,447 --> 01:07:00,248
Look, I got your back, okay?

1150
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,250
We're gonna make it
out of this...

1151
01:07:02,252 --> 01:07:04,119
The way we always do.

1152
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:05,153
Okay.

1153
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:06,721
You guys okay?

1154
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:09,624
Remind me to never take
travel advice from you again.

1155
01:07:09,626 --> 01:07:13,061
We've got to figure out a way
to get outside these walls.

1156
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:14,462
How? We're surrounded
by soldiers,

1157
01:07:14,464 --> 01:07:15,697
and the gates are closed.

1158
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,565
Fauzi: I have idea.
There is a way.

1159
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:19,267
- Crazy. It won't work.
- What?

1160
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:24,606
Sarah: What?

1161
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:26,374
When he was a kid,
he used to smuggle food...

1162
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,743
he wants to go out
through the caves.

1163
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:30,578
But it's one big maze
down there.

1164
01:07:36,486 --> 01:07:38,086
It was 40 years ago,

1165
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:39,587
but he thinks he can
remember the way out.

1166
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:41,256
Tomer: Oh, he thinks!

1167
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:43,224
Sarah: Okay, what are we
waiting for? Let's go.

1168
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:45,660
What? You wanna go down to those
caves with those creatures?

1169
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:46,828
No fucking way.

1170
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,530
Rache, if we stay here, we die.

1171
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:51,499
My dad is right.
The only way out of this city

1172
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:53,468
is down the caves
and under the walls.

1173
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:55,703
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- But it's so stupid!

1174
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:58,573
Sounds like a plan.
A stupid one, but a plan.

1175
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,275
Get ready.
We're moving. Come on.

1176
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,447
- Sarah: Okay, let's go.
- Rachel: Guys?

1177
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:06,815
- What?
- What is it?

1178
01:08:06,817 --> 01:08:08,516
- Guys!
- Rache, what is it?

1179
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:10,485
- Omar: What is it, Rachel?
- You gotta see this.

1180
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:12,320
Sarah: I don't see anything.

1181
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:16,491
Glass, zoom in.

1182
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:18,259
What is that?

1183
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,133
Rache! Rache!

1184
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:28,803
Kevin: Let's go, guys!
Hurry up!

1185
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:33,341
Let's go! Omar!

1186
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:38,146
Rache, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1187
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,253
- Come on.
- Let's go! Come on. Go!

1188
01:08:45,255 --> 01:08:48,656
Omar.

1189
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:50,625
Sarah: What's the matter?

1190
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:53,361
Guys? Why have you stopped?

1191
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:01,336
What's going on?

1192
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,319
Rache. Rache?
Are you okay?

1193
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:19,787
Yeah.

1194
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:21,389
It's okay.

1195
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:22,790
It's okay.

1196
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:28,730
Hey.

1197
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:30,498
See the street?

1198
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,267
It's the via delarosa.

1199
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:34,936
It's about 600 meters
to the cave entrance.

1200
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:37,405
We're almost there.
Don't worry.

1201
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,240
Everything will be fine.

1202
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:41,709
Yeah.

1203
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:44,712
Sarah: Rache?

1204
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:47,715
- What have you got there?
- What?

1205
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:50,285
Oh, my god.

1206
01:09:50,287 --> 01:09:52,287
I'm fine. It's nothing.

1207
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:53,588
Kevin?

1208
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,292
It's nothing.

1209
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:58,426
What?

1210
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:01,229
Well, what? Talk to me.

1211
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:03,331
Sarah: Nothing.
Are you feeling okay?

1212
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:05,333
Yes! I told you I'm fine!
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1213
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:07,769
Nothing.
It's just a scratch.

1214
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:12,607
Use this.

1215
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:20,448
So what do we do now?

1216
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,317
I don't know.

1217
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,752
I think we have
to tell the others.

1218
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:26,421
What?

1219
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:28,890
Before it's too late.
We have to tell them.

1220
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:30,258
No fucking way.

1221
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,294
- Listen.
- No, just listen to me.

1222
01:10:33,296 --> 01:10:35,296
I don't trust these guys, okay?

1223
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:37,966
They're soldiers.
They're gonna kill her.

1224
01:10:37,968 --> 01:10:40,668
This thing is contagious.

1225
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,504
You saw what happened
at the asylum.

1226
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:46,774
She'll become violent soon.
We have to do something

1227
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:49,277
or none of us is getting
out of those caves alive.

1228
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:51,279
That's why we need
to get her to a doctor now.

1229
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:54,282
- She'll be fine.
- It's too dangerous.

1230
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:56,684
So what are you gonna do?
We're just gonna leave her here?

1231
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:58,486
Maybe.

1232
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:00,855
I don't know.

1233
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:02,857
Just like they left you?

1234
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:11,366
You listen to me.

1235
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:13,901
You owe me, okay?
I saved your ass.

1236
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:17,305
So you just shut up
and do this for my friend.

1237
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:19,741
Omar: Guys, come on!

1238
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:22,377
Okay, guys.

1239
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:24,646
Guys, come on.
We don't have time.

1240
01:11:24,648 --> 01:11:26,281
Sarah: Okay, we're coming.

1241
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:28,850
Go, go, go!

1242
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:30,418
Rache, come on.
We gotta go.

1243
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,053
Let's get the fuck
out of this city, okay?

1244
01:11:32,055 --> 01:11:33,454
Okay.

1245
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,356
Yehuda: Come on! Come on!

1246
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:36,791
Sarah: Come on.

1247
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,501
Tomar: Come on. Come on.
Let's go.

1248
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:50,538
Rache. Oh, my god.

1249
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,006
- Rache, are you okay?
- What's wrong?

1250
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:53,508
Wait. Just give her
a minute, okay?

1251
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,777
Just give her a second.
She'll be okay.

1252
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:57,712
Rache. Oh, shit.

1253
01:11:57,714 --> 01:12:00,081
Oh, my god. Rache.

1254
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:03,051
Rache. You okay?

1255
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:05,820
Oh, fuck. Oh, my god.

1256
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,556
- Turn around.
- Rachel: Fuck you, asshole.

1257
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:11,092
Sarah: No, Yehuda.

1258
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:13,328
- I said turn around.
- Listen. No, listen, please.

1259
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:14,862
Please. I'm begging you.
Please don't.

1260
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:16,864
Please. I'm begging you.

1261
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:19,567
Hey! Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

1262
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:21,502
Rachel!

1263
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,571
Oh, my god. Kevin!

1264
01:12:23,573 --> 01:12:24,772
Kevin, help!

1265
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:26,507
What the fuck is going on here?

1266
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,576
- Move aside.
- Put it down!

1267
01:12:28,578 --> 01:12:29,744
I said move aside.

1268
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:31,512
- Put it down!
- No.

1269
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,581
You have three seconds,
or I'll shoot both of you.

1270
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:35,083
Move aside!

1271
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,486
- Move aside.
- Kevin!

1272
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:47,095
Listen to me.
I'm sorry,

1273
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:49,597
but I'm not going down
to the gate with them!

1274
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:52,834
- Rache.
- Rachel.

1275
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:57,405
Shit.

1276
01:12:57,407 --> 01:12:58,840
Take cover!

1277
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,610
Glass, zoom in.

1278
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:13,921
Glass, zoom out.

1279
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:17,158
Oh, shit.

1280
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,660
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!

1281
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:35,676
Oh, my god.

1282
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:41,182
Omar: This way! Here!

1283
01:13:41,184 --> 01:13:44,051
- Faster, Sarah.
- Come on, guys. Go.

1284
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:46,654
Omar: Come on.
Go, go, go.

1285
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:48,656
Sarah: Come on.

1286
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:50,758
Omar: Take the helmets.
Take the helmets.

1287
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,561
- Take one. Quick.
- Okay. Okay.

1288
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:54,996
Take the helmets. Quick.

1289
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,666
You got it.

1290
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:00,001
Okay.

1291
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,704
- You good?
- Yeah.

1292
01:14:03,706 --> 01:14:05,206
Omar: Here. Put it on.

1293
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:07,608
- Rache.
- Look at me. Are you good?

1294
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,043
Okay, you can do this.

1295
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:10,678
You're okay.

1296
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:13,147
Sarah: Rache. Hey, rache.

1297
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:15,683
You okay? Come on.
You're okay, right?

1298
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:18,453
Omar: Let's move on. Quick.

1299
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:28,596
Oh, my god.

1300
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:30,064
What the hell?

1301
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:42,643
What? You got a better idea?
Come on. Let's get out of here.

1302
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,911
Let's go.

1303
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:45,947
Omar: I know the way.

1304
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:47,648
Let's go.

1305
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,617
From here. Come on.

1306
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:50,852
Kevin: Come on. Come on.

1307
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:52,687
- Come on, guys.
- Come on, guys.

1308
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:54,922
Go. Omar!

1309
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:55,990
Come on, guys.

1310
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,527
Sarah: Rache. Rache.
It'll be okay, okay?

1311
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:00,928
We'll get you to a doctor soon.

1312
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,129
Come on, rache.
Just keep going.

1313
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:03,931
Don't take your eyes off her.

1314
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:05,700
- Omar: Everything okay there?
- Everything's fine.

1315
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:08,669
Fauzi, keep going.

1316
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,572
Tomar: Where's the way, fauzi?
Where we go now?

1317
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:14,742
Fauzi: I don't remember.

1318
01:15:14,744 --> 01:15:16,644
Fauzi: I need a minute.

1319
01:15:16,646 --> 01:15:17,712
Rache?

1320
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:21,716
Hey. Hey.

1321
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:23,718
Rache?

1322
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,720
Rache, you all right?

1323
01:15:25,722 --> 01:15:27,088
Rache?

1324
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:29,257
Hey, it's okay.

1325
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:30,725
Rachel?

1326
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:32,960
Look at me.
Look at me.

1327
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:34,729
Look at me.

1328
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,002
Oh, my god.

1329
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,672
God, Rachel.

1330
01:15:44,674 --> 01:15:47,642
I'm afraid I'm going
to hurt you.

1331
01:15:47,644 --> 01:15:50,611
Listen to me.
Listen to me, okay?

1332
01:15:50,613 --> 01:15:53,748
We're getting out of here.
Okay?

1333
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,750
- Okay.
- We're getting out of here.

1334
01:15:55,752 --> 01:15:57,618
- It's going to be okay.
- Fauzi: Okay.

1335
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,754
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay, I remember now.

1336
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:02,623
I think this is the way.
From here. Come on.

1337
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,060
- Yehuda: Your friend is dead.
- What?

1338
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,563
She just don't know it yet.

1339
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:10,731
Shut up!

1340
01:16:10,733 --> 01:16:12,133
Omar.

1341
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,173
Omar.

1342
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:21,676
We are close.
Don't worry.

1343
01:16:21,678 --> 01:16:23,344
Fauzi: This way. Follow me.

1344
01:16:23,346 --> 01:16:25,846
This is the sign they left here
when they were kids.

1345
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:28,716
- Fauzi: I know the way.
- This way. Come.

1346
01:16:28,718 --> 01:16:30,351
Sarah: Thank god.

1347
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:35,790
Did you hear that?

1348
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:37,892
Shit, shit.

1349
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:41,929
Oh, shit.

1350
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,298
- Kevin, they're here.
- Come on. Let's go!

1351
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,644
Sarah: What just happened?

1352
01:16:56,646 --> 01:16:58,813
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

1353
01:16:58,815 --> 01:17:00,815
Whatever is happening out there,

1354
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:02,817
I hope the good guys
are winning.

1355
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:17,999
Sarah: Rachel, you okay?

1356
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:21,302
Hey, hang in there, rache, okay?

1357
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:29,844
Sarah: Rache?

1358
01:17:29,846 --> 01:17:31,779
Hey, you feeling okay?

1359
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:33,280
Kevin: Are we getting close?

1360
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:35,783
Omar: We have to find
the water pools under the walls.

1361
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:37,852
- It's the only way out.
- Rache, come on.

1362
01:17:37,854 --> 01:17:39,186
Fuck you!

1363
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:40,855
Kevin: Rachel!

1364
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:43,090
No!

1365
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:44,925
Rache! Rachel!

1366
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:47,895
Rachel! Rachel!

1367
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:54,101
Rachel!

1368
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:57,405
- No, no, no, no.
- Rachel, no!

1369
01:17:57,407 --> 01:17:59,340
Go back!

1370
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:01,742
Rache...

1371
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,446
Kevin: Go back!

1372
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:06,981
- Shit.
- Sarah: What's going on?

1373
01:18:10,219 --> 01:18:12,253
Move back!

1374
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:29,203
Kevin: Sarah! Sarah!

1375
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:35,810
Sarah!

1376
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,861
Sarah: Rache.

1377
01:18:53,863 --> 01:18:54,929
Hey.

1378
01:19:08,944 --> 01:19:10,811
Rachel.

1379
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:23,290
Run.

1380
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,793
Rachel, no.

1381
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,329
Run.

1382
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:29,964
- No.
- Now!

1383
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:31,966
No.

1384
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:23,184
Oh, my god.

1385
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:29,523
Rache.

1386
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:31,025
Rachel.

1387
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:34,595
Rachel, please.

1388
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:37,198
Rachel, please don't leave me.

1389
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:40,267
Rache.

1390
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:42,837
Rache.

1391
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:46,040
Rache.

1392
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:55,549
Oh, my god.

1393
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,186
Oh, my god.

1394
01:21:05,995 --> 01:21:07,461
Oh, my god.

1395
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:24,411
Sarah: I remember now.
I'm just playing a video game.

1396
01:21:24,413 --> 01:21:26,647
This is all just
a fucking video game!

1397
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:34,121
Who's there? Who's there?

1398
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:38,392
Kevin!
Kevin, is that you?

1399
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:40,394
Omar?

1400
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:44,131
Who's there?

1401
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:48,168
Who's there?

1402
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,154
- Kevin: Sarah!
- Oh, my god!

1403
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:09,056
Kevin, no. Oh, my god!

1404
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:10,257
Kevin!

1405
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,092
- Fuck.
- I didn't mean it.

1406
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:14,628
I didn't mean to do that.
Oh, my god.

1407
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:16,096
Omar: Where is everybody?

1408
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,464
Oh, my god. Omar.

1409
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,166
Omar, I'm so sorry.

1410
01:22:19,168 --> 01:22:20,567
Aba. Aba!

1411
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:21,969
- Omar.
- Oh, my god!

1412
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:23,704
- Aba!
- Omar. Come on!

1413
01:22:23,706 --> 01:22:25,539
- I'm so sorry!
- Omar, come with me!

1414
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:27,241
- Omar. Omar.
- I didn't mean to do it!

1415
01:22:27,243 --> 01:22:29,176
Come on, Omar.

1416
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:30,978
Aba!

1417
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,080
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

1418
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:36,717
- Oh, my god.
- Come on. Come on.

1419
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,087
Come on.

1420
01:22:41,691 --> 01:22:43,524
Kevin: Watch out.

1421
01:22:43,526 --> 01:22:45,326
Kevin: Are you okay?

1422
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:53,200
Sarah: Where do we go now?

1423
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:56,003
We don't know the way.

1424
01:22:57,273 --> 01:22:59,206
Shit.

1425
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:20,227
Please protect me
from all evil in the world.

1426
01:23:22,231 --> 01:23:26,233
Sarah: <i>Sh'ma yisrael adonai
eloheinu adonai echad.</i>

1427
01:23:26,235 --> 01:23:27,768
I'm sorry.

1428
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:29,303
<i>Sh'ma yisrael adonai

01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,140
<i>- Sh'ma yisrael...

1432
01:23:35,611 --> 01:23:37,311
Amen.

01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:40,247
<i>Sh'ma yisrael adonai...</i>

1434
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:42,716
Omar, no! Omar, no!

1435
01:23:42,718 --> 01:23:45,152
- Fuck!
- Oh, my god!

1436
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:47,254
Fuck. Shit.

1437

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Sarah.

1440
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:59,800
I'm sorry. God.

1441
01:23:59,802 --> 01:24:02,269
- I'm scared. I'm so scared.
- I'm sorry.

1442
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:17,818
Sarah?

1443
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:20,320
- Kevin.
- They're coming.

1444
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:22,089
What? What?

1445
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:24,491
Turn off the light.

1446
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:14,341
Joel, is that you?

1447
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:17,744
Where is he?
I can't see him.

1448
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:20,347
Kevin, come on.
Let's go.

1449
01:25:20,349 --> 01:25:22,382
Okay, let's go.

1450
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:25,419
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1451
01:25:28,357 --> 01:25:31,358
Where is he?

1452
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,628
That's the way.
He's showing us the way.

1453
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,663
This way. This way.
Come on.

1454
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:41,502
Where is he?

1455
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,370
Where is he? Shit.

1456
01:25:43,372 --> 01:25:45,372
We better not lose him.

1457
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:47,708
Come on. This way.

1458
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,344
Where is he?

1459
01:25:51,881 --> 01:25:53,480
Come on.

1460
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:56,483
Joel, I miss you.

1461
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:59,786
I miss you so much, Joel.

1462
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:02,756
Kevin: Sarah, come on. Let's go.

1463
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:05,325
Can you hear that?
I think it's water.

1464
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:07,394
We're close, Sarah.

1465
01:26:07,396 --> 01:26:09,830
- Joel?
- Come on.

1466
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,398
We're close.

1467
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,900
Joel!

1468
01:26:14,402 --> 01:26:16,403
Kevin: Here it is!

1469
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:19,406
Come on, Sarah.

1470
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,414
Come on.

1471
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:53,607
Sarah: Oh, god, fresh air.

1472
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,643
We made it.

1473
01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:58,512
We made it.

1474
01:26:58,514 --> 01:26:59,913
Come here.

1475
01:27:02,684 --> 01:27:04,685
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1476
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:06,753
Come on. Let's go.

1477
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:18,298
Come on. Take my hand.

1478
01:27:25,673 --> 01:27:27,774
Watch your step.

1479
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,712
Come on, Sarah!
We made it!

1480
01:27:31,714 --> 01:27:33,480
Come on!

1481
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:42,490
Kevin: Shit, it's locked.

1482
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:50,597
- Glass...
- come on! Open up!

1483
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,467
Call dad.

1484
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:00,340
Glass, call dad.

1485
01:28:01,677 --> 01:28:03,644
Open up!

1486
01:28:05,747 --> 01:28:07,581
- Open up!
- Kevin.

1487
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:10,817
Open up. Come on!

1488
01:28:10,819 --> 01:28:12,853
Oh, my god.

1489
01:28:12,855 --> 01:28:14,488
What's happening to me?

1490
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:17,524
- Fuck.
- What's happening to me?

1491
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:19,526
Oh, my god!

1492
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:28,035
Come on, Sarah!
It's open!

1493
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:04,805
Kevin.

1494
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:16,583
