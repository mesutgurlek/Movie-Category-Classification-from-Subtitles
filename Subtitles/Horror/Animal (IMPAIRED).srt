- Yeah, it has.

23
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:22,961
Alissa, you remember
where that turnoff is?

24
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,030
One or two miles past
the Holland Creek sign.

25
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,069
Does he even know where he's going?

26
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,904
No.

27
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,539
I do.

28
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,942
- (SHOUTS) Is this it?
- Holy shit. Sean.

29
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,878
Almost, man. This is the
road, but we still got...

30
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,679
- (SHOUTS) Huh?
- Almost!

31
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,967
Oh, my God. It's like
talking to a deaf person.

that that make me wear these.

(DRIVER) I don't know.

45
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:12,737
It's bullshit. It's a lie to keep people
quiet while they chop it all down.

46
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,106
It isn't nice to
fool Mother Nature.

47
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:19,945
No, it is not. They're chopping down
trees that are a hundred years old.

48
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,781
Yo. Someone's a little pissed.

49
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:24,716
I am pissed.

50
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,618
Sorry.
No, it's okay.

51
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,788
That's why we came... to enjoy
what's here before it's gone.

52
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,490
Yeah.

Guys, guys, guys.

54
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,160
Don't... Don't bring
any of that on the trail.

55
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,062
- Oh, it's coming. Yeah, it's coming.
- Shut up, Sean.

56
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,897
You're gonna get off my car.

57
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,968
- Actually, can we get around this thing?
- (SEAN) Yeah. Just knock it down.

58
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,504
So, this is the place you
were telling me about?

59
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:48,240
Almost. A little further down. But
might as well be the same thing.

60
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,941
It's all the same forest.

61
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:54,579
We used to camp here every summer.

62
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,048
It was like our one
family tradition.

63
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,818
Think this is gonna score me some
brownie points with your folks...

64
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,821
or, uh, your brother?

65
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,956
I wouldn't count on it.

66
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,158
All right, what do you think?

67
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,227
- Close enough?
- Here. This will be great.

68
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,695
- You sure?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,898
All right. Let's suit up.

70
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:17,002
(SCOFFS)

71
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,944
This ain't right. I'm supposed
to be fixing <i>your</i> backpack.

72
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,714
Oh, is it intimidating that your
girlfriend is used to the outdoors?

73
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,250
What? What? No.
No, I'm just saying...

74
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,920
at least I know you'll be
all right if I wasn't here.

75
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,855
Yeah, I'd be okay.

76
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:43,161
Hey. Sorry, man.
I'm just trying to hurry.

77
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,963
How much shit you put in there?

78
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,065
Just enough. You'll thank me later.

79
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,071
What about the rest of the
stuff? Is it gonna be safe here?

80
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,040
Yeah.

81
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,208
Better than losing it
in the woods, right?

82
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,046
Are you sure?

83
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,781
I'm sure.

84
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,883
Let's go. We're burning daylight.

85
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,620
Are you sure?

86
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,255
Yeah, I'm sure.

87
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:13,058
At least you're not the drill
sergeant your brother is.

88
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,860
That's the "step" part. His dad.

89
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,996
- (DRIVER) I heard that.
- Ooh!

90
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,631
I hear everything.

Hey. You're not bringing that.

93
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,769
What?

94
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:27,005
Put it in the car. This is
our date with Mother Nature.

95
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,674
What? It's mood music.
You usually like it.

96
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,110
What are we waiting for?

97
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,315
- You know it's a hike, right?
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?

98
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,018
We don't have to look good?
You look fine. Let's go.

99
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,386
Alissa, let me explain
something to you.

100
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,989
You are a natural beauty,
okay? It's a gift.

101
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:47,859
Girls like me, we gotta take
what we got and work it.

102
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,761
Besides, I have
a reputation to uphold.

103
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,696
It's just us.
Oh, Liss.

104
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,933
You know better than that.
It's never just us.

105
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,369
Group, get together.

106
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,638
All right, guys, get together.
Get closer.

107
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,039
You're ready? One.

108
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,008
Two. Everyone say "fifth wheel."

109

Fifth wheel!

Oh, you're so cute
when you're pathetic.

111
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,849
You're not cute in that photo.

112
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,652
(CLICKS) Oh, my God. Is that
what my hair looks like?

(LAUGHS)

114
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,728
What?

115
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,199
Am I that obvious?

116
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,435
Relax.
Enjoy it.

117
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:33,004
These woods won't even be
here in the next few years.

118
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:36,274
I will if you give me a kiss.

119
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,277
That a girl.

120
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,189
- (MAN) I'm gonna stop.
- (ALISSA) For what?

121
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,307
Dare me?
No!

122
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,176
Don't do it.

123
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,811
You dare me?

124
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,483
(SEAN)
So this is pretty much it, huh?

125
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:22,854
We just keep walking and then
turn around and walk back?

126
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,090
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

127
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,194
I'm taking you guys to this
amazing cave near the creek.

128
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,730
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

129
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:34,399
Alissa and I used to go swimming there
all the time when we were kids.

130
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,869
Swimming? You never said anything
about bringing a bathing suit.

131
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,010
Did I forget to tell you about...

132
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:41,039
- the bathing suit?
- You did.

133
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:45,977
What were you thinking?
You'll be fine without it.

134
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,180
Does it ever get awkward seeing your
best friend kiss your brother like that?

135
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,217
It was inevitable.
But yes.

136
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,519
So how long has it been for you?

137
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,363
It's been a while now...
like six or seven years.

138
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:58,323
Really?

139
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,792
We stopped coming after we moved.

140
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:03,528
The trip got too long
and we got busy.

141
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,832
- Yeah, it's a... it's a long-ass drive.
- Yeah.

142
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,434
But it's worth it though.

143
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,103
- It's gorgeous out here.
- I know.

144
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,439
Does it look familiar
at all to you?

145
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,776
Sort of looks familiar,
but it feels different.

146
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,978
Feels different.
Mm-hmm.

147
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,412
Feels different, how?

148
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,416
- I don't know.
- This different?

149
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,997
(CHATTERING)

150
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,132
(SEAN) Hey, Jeff, you never
said anything about this.

151
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,804
Oh, it's just a little
safety precaution.

152
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:51,242
He said that the tree cutting has been
displacing animals from the deeper areas.

153
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,912
(SEAN) Uh, does it work?
Yeah, it works.

154
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,014
Can of that stuff will send
a grizzly bear running.

155
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:58,283
Oh, so you've used it.
Yes...

156
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,952
Uh, no, I haven't used it,
but I know how to use it.

157
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,421
So if a giant bear comes
out of the woods right now,

158
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,857
and it's like... (GROWLING)

me to your supervisor?

Hey.

00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:31,295

I'm sorry about your brother.

How'd you guys get here?

387
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:45,709
Um, we were on a business
trip and the car broke down,

388
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,078
so we were cutting through the woods
trying to get to the main highway,

389
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,282
and that thing just chased us here.

00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:56,854
It just... It just happened too
fast to do anything more than run.

391
00:25:56,856 --> 00:25:58,989
How long you been here?

392
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,792
- Um...
- (SEAN) Hey, guys.

393
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,428
Um, your phone just died.

394
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:08,666
But I was able to leave word at the
ranger's office, and I talked to 911,

395
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,434
and they said they were gonna
send someone as soon as possible.

396
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,369
- Where?
- Here.

397
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:15,272
They're gonna trace the call to
the nearest cell phone tower.

398
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:19,410
Also I texted your
parents, and I...

399
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,178
was vague,

400
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,280
but they said they're sending help.

401
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,015
Someone in the area. Friends.

402
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:27,418
Your parents know
people in the area?

403
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,821
They used to. Hopefully they
can send someone to help.

404
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,990
Well, that sounds promising.

405
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:37,394
Okay, so we just wait it
out here until it's safe?

406
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:38,896
Well, we are safe here, right?

407
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,166
Sure.

- (MAN) It doesn't matter.

wouldn't be soon enough.

we opened the damn door.

a fresh dose of our scent,

422
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:33,383

after it's eaten.

424
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:41,525
How... How do you know that?

425
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:44,328
Because there wasn't
always three of us.

426
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,965
Now, assuming that
it does slow down,

427
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,267
this should be a good time to make
sure that we're safe in here.

up when we got here.

Some are new. Some are older.

'em all, find the weak ones,

00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,813
we can reinforce them,
keep the beast at bay.

that it can be that smart?

just knows more about this place than we do.

us here, eating what it can

But you can't keep doing this.

is happening because it just is.

00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:56,458
You start thinking
about all this weird shit.

782
00:54:57,795 --> 00:55:02,865
About, like, your life flashing
before your eyes or something.

783
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:05,501
But, like, that's... it's
not been my experience.

784
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:08,637
My experience is,
like, thinking, like,

785
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:11,774
"What was the last song I listened to
on my iPod?" Like, Taylor Swift. Really.

786
00:55:11,776 --> 00:55:14,042
Like, that's gonna be
the last thing I hear?

787
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:17,780
Like... Remember junior year...

788
00:55:17,782 --> 00:55:20,849
when I was breaking
out, like, horrible.

789
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:24,953
Remember I was, like, using a lot of
foundation? Going through a period.

790
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:29,091
I stole, like, 99% of
that from the MAC store.

791
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:32,528
Like, you start thinking about,
like, secrets, you know.

792
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:36,131
Like... Like shit you don't
wanna die with, you know.

793
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,800
Like secrets you don't
wanna die with.

794
00:55:37,802 --> 00:55:41,470
Or like secrets that
other people...

795
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:43,038
have to die with.

796
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,576
We're gonna get out of here and we're
gonna forget all about this place.

797
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:49,912
Mandy, um...

798
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:00,989
I was... I was in love with Jeff.

799
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,226
Of course you were.

800
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,162
Who wasn't?

801
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:11,467
No, like, I was in love with Jeff.

802
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:13,235
- That's great. Let's just drop it.
- No, no, please.

803
00:56:13,237 --> 00:56:16,839
I need you to hear this. I-I-I
can't be buried with this.

804
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:18,941
You're not getting buried at all,
so let's just drop it, okay?

805
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,877
You had a gay crush on my
boyfriend. That's fine.

806
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,512
Okay? He's dead now.

807
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:29,151
Oh, my God. Like, how can
you even talk like that?

808
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:32,020
I don't wanna talk at all.
I wanna drop it. So does Alissa.

809
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:35,023
- Right?
- We get it, Sean.

810
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,959
Just move on.
(SIGHS)

811
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:44,166
It wasn't one-sided.

812
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:52,774
- Look, I know this is not the appropriate...
- You're an asshole.

813
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,977
- Please, Mandy, I'm just trying to...
- You're an asshole.

814
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:55,579
I'm not an asshole.

815
00:56:55,605 --> 00:56:57,179
- I'm just trying to tell you the truth.
- You're lying.

816
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,681
Why... Why would
I ever lie about this?

817
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:01,783
- Then why are you telling me this now?
- I'm just trying to tell...

818
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:04,219
Why are you telling me now? What
am I supposed to do about this?

819
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:06,121
What do I do with this
information now, Sean?

820
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:11,026
- I'm just trying to tell you before I can't!
- (ALISSA) Stop! The both of you.

821
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:13,028
We can't do this right now.

822
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:20,235
(BEEPING)

823
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:22,738
Is anyone else hearing this?

824
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,273
(BEEPING)

825
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:26,174
- What's that?
- (DOUGLAS) Hey!

826
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,544
(BEEPING CONTINUES)
(DOUGLAS) Hey!

827
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:33,649
(BEEPING)

828
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,922
Matt, is that you?

829
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,325
<i>(GROANING)</i>

830
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:45,193
Matt, where are you?

831
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:47,162
<i>(STATIC)</i>

832
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:48,864
Where are you?

833
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,601
(BEEPING)

834
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:54,603
Is that a battery?

835
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:56,672
(BEEPING)

836
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:58,674
No, it's a page. He's trying
to tell us something.

837
00:57:58,676 --> 00:58:00,943
He could be anywhere.
(BEEPS)

838
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:03,245
(BEEPING, FAINT)

839
00:58:03,247 --> 00:58:04,813
But that's impossible.

840
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,348
(BEEPING, FAINT)

841
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:08,350
- Is that...
- Close.

842
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:13,322
I'll help. Somebody untie me. Hey!

843
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:18,860
(DOUGLAS) Wherever he is, that
thing is probably with him!

844
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,109
- (BEEPING, FAINT)
- Oh, come on, you gotta be kidding me.

845
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:37,012
- He's in the cellar.
- Shit.

846
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,123
You're not seriously going
down there, are you?

847
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:50,125
- I have to.
- But, Alissa, what if he's...

848
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:52,027
- He's alive. You heard him.
- Here.

849
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,862
But what if he's barely alive?

850
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,330
How does that make a difference?

851
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,837
Give me that. You swing better
with less in your hands.

852
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:02,904
You guys are insane.

853
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,374
Wait. Hey, Al...

854
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:08,010
Uh, is it okay if I...

855
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:10,646
Can I sit this one out? I don't
think I can do it again.

856
00:59:10,648 --> 00:59:12,881
I know.

857
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:16,718
Thank you.

858
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,187
You do realize that thing tried
to leap out of there earlier.

859
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,723
- If you open that door...
- Stop!

860
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,960
Here are your choices.

861
00:59:24,962 --> 00:59:27,996
You can come with me
or you can stay here.

862
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:31,066
I don't trust you to
do anything else.

863
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,201
What'll it be?

864
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,776
That's what I thought.

865
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:44,413
If anything happens to me, my blood
is on your hands. You hear me?

866
00:59:44,415 --> 00:59:45,981
On your hands!

867
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,386
Okay, you guys, ready?

868
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:53,155
Here we go. You close
the door behind us.

869
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:54,790
- No, no. I'm going with you.
- Vicky, no.

870
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,792
I'm going with you, Carl.

871
00:59:56,794 --> 00:59:59,261
- You can't come with me.
- I can't... I can't keep running.

872
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,396
Stop. You gotta stop.
Carl, I'm going with you.

873
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,898
- Stop.
- No!

874
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,466
Stop!

875
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:07,035
I know you hate when people
tell you what to do,

876
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:10,405
but I can't very well go down there
and tell that thing who's boss...

877
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:12,474
if I have to worry about you.

878
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:15,177
I'll be safe if you're safe.

879
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:16,812
Okay?

880
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,757
Let's go.

881
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,352
Shh.

01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,027

884
01:01:07,363 --> 01:01:09,331
Come on.

01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:12,768
(BEEPING)

886
01:01:18,407 --> 01:01:20,976
(BEEPING GROWS LOUDER)
Matt. Guys, there he is.

887
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:25,247
(CARL) Let's get him out of here.

888
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:26,882
Get him up.

889
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,390
Take his arms. I'll get his legs.

890
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:37,993
- Ready?
- (ALISSA, MANDY) Yeah.

891
01:01:37,995 --> 01:01:39,961
(GRUNTS)
One, two. Come on.

892
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,799
(SCREAMING)

893
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:45,867
Get him out of here. Get out!

894
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:51,306
Come on. Come on. Come on.

895
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,280
Come on, baby. Come on.

896
01:01:58,282 --> 01:01:59,915
Come on.

897
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:42,991

01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:51,967
Just relax.

01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:00,942
You're gonna be okay. I'm
gonna get you out of here.

902
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,549
Come on. Come on. Come on.

903
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:10,452
(SHUDDERING CONTINUES)

904

You'll be okay. You'll be okay.

906
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:39,281
There's...
(SHUDDERING)

907
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:41,049
- Shh.
- There's...

908
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:44,019
There's...
(STAMMERING)

909
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,691
What's he... What's he saying?

910
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,098
He's dying, hon.

911
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,603
I'm sorry to say it. I truly am.

912
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:04,172
But someone has to.

913
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,274
Sporto's not gonna
last much longer.

914
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:09,144
We can still save him.

915
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:11,680
I don't think you can
be so sure about that.

916
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:16,451
But he can still save <i>us.</i>

917
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:22,390
He can be...
the diversion we need.

918
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:26,161
He can distract that thing
while we run for it.

919
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:29,097
You mean give it
something to chew on?

920
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:34,169
I was trying not to
say it like that.

921
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:37,339
Conversation's over, sicko.

922
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:40,175
He was willing to lay down his
life earlier for you guys.

923
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:42,644
Don't you see it? Now he can.

924
01:04:42,646 --> 01:04:45,380
(SHUDDERING)
As bait?

925
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,482
- He's already dead.
- Not yet.

926
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:54,723
Carl was the most
capable of all of us.

927
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:58,326
If that thing got to him, how
can we hope to do any better?

928
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:02,330
Matt, dead, is our chance.

929
01:05:02,332 --> 01:05:04,366
I'm not saying it's an
easy pill to swallow.

930
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:06,568
It's just fact.

931
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,636
If anybody has a better idea,

932
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:11,139
believe me, I'm all ears.

933
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:17,312
We know if we open that door,
that thing's coming in.

934
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:19,247
So let's trap it.

935
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,250
We torch this place, and we
get the hell out of here.

936
