00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:03,455
How did they know
where to hang the photos?

8
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,590
I told them.

9
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:07,392
If something's in the
wrong place, we'll fix it.

10

We'll fix it.

00:11:56,483 --> 00:12:01,920
I can feel Bobby
in this house.

00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,521
Annie, the reason
we moved up here...

Moving away from

as moving away from
the memories.

He's always going to be with us.

I really don't care
how far he has to drive.

41
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:52,804
We had the inspection
over a month ago

42
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,305
and I've called
several times already.

there's nothing wrong...</i>

I understand,

45
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,244
but the smell in the cellar
needs to be taken care of.

46
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,679
Now.

47
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:02,747
It smells like smoke.

48
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:03,882
<i>Have you seen any smoke, sir?</i>

49
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,750
No, I haven't seen smoke

50
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,752
but I think I know
what it smells like.

51
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:09,320
It's a hundred degrees
down there.

52
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,523

somebody out in the morning.</i>

53
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,458
Thank you.

54
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,527
I'll see him then.

55
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,299
Well, the electrician is
finally coming out...

56
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,134
Look.

57
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,302
Oh, hon.

58
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,236
Did you drop it?

59
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,738
No.

60
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,907
I found it like this.

61
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,608
Well, I'll just
get another frame

62
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,177
when I go into town tomorrow.

63
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,913
You don't think it
means something?

64
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,449
What?

65
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,585
He never liked this photo.

66
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:44,289
Remember how we always hid it
when girls came over?

67
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,959
Yeah.

68
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:52,163
- He used to say that he
thought his smile was...
- Crooked.

69
00:13:56,203 --> 00:14:00,138
And you think he
still doesn't like it?

70
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,309
[knocking on door]

No.

73
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,583
Find a spot for the photo and
we'll get a new frame tomorrow.

74
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:25,096
I told you someone was home.

75
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:27,432
I'm Dave McCabe.
This is my wife Cat.

76
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,734
We live down the road.

77
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:32,136
We're your neighbors.

78
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:32,904
Hello.

79
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,239
I'm Paul Sacchetti.

80
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:38,076
This is my wife Anne,
and we live here,

81
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,512
and we are your neighbors.

82
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,114
Very nice to meet you.

83
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,983
Well, we've been two weeks

84
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:48,419
and you're the first
folks to come by.

85
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,022
Two weeks?

86
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,758
That is a surprise.

87
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,827
Usually there's a bit
of chatter in town

88
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,996
when someone moves
into this old house...

89
00:14:57,998 --> 00:15:02,033
you know,
with the history and all.

90
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,769
Oh, where's my manners?
I'm sorry.

91
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,337
Would you like to
come in for a drink?

92
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,907
Oh, well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

93
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,041
Pardon the mess.

94
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,944
We're still getting
a little settled in.

95
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,846
Oh, no, it's, uh...

96
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,314
This is lovely.
Lovely.

97
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,349
Thank you.

98
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,685
Oh, uh, what can I get
for the two of you?

99
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:21,853
A tea or...

100
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,987
- Oh, don't bother.
- A coffee maybe.

101
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,989
- Whiskey?
- Oh.

102
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,258
That'll be very nice.
Sit, Cat.

103
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Go ahead, sit.

104
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:41,072
So, um, what was this history
you mentioned, Dave?

105
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,174
We heard it was
a funeral parlor

106
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,410
around the turn of the century?

107
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:49,614
But, I've got to say,
the price they were asking

108
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,416
wasn't about to scare us away.

109
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,184
Good. Good.

110
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:58,056
So, the realtor told you
all about the Dagmars.

111
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,491
Yes. That was the family...
Thank you...

112
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:01,592
Who first lived here, right?

113
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,094
Yes.
Yes, that's right.

114
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:08,066
I mean, the town built this
house for him back in 1859.

115
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,300
Well, cheers.

116
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,702
Oh, yes.

117
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:14,005
To new friends,
and new beginnings.

118
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,242
1859.
You don't say?

119
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,444
Yeah.

120
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:24,382
It wasn't long after that
that the trouble began.

121
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,285
Old Dagmar had been
running the parlor

122
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:30,555
no more than a couple
of months when...

123
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:34,292
well, what do you know,
word got out that

124
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:38,396
they were selling the bodies
and burying empty coffins.

125
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:41,532
People were saying he
was selling the corpses

126
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:45,036
to the university
over in Essex County.

127
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,105
Some even said he was selling
them to the Orientals

128
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:51,509
over in Boston,
turning them into chop suey.

129
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,311
[coughing]

130
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:56,147
The town ran him
and his wife

131
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,217
and the little girl
out on a rail.

132
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,920
It was just the saddest thing.

133
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,255
They moved to Providence

134
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:10,161
but his family just couldn't
stand the sight of him.

135
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:14,265
Old Dagmar drank himself to
death no more than a year later.

136
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,136
They say he was no more than
a shell of a man at the end.

137
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:22,106
He was more than a shell.

138
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,175
- No, we hadn't heard anything...
- You told us...

139
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,476
(whispering)
Honey, it's all right.

140
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,845
No. You're quite right, kid,
you're quite right.

141
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,748
Yes.
I'm so sorry.

142
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,018
Here I am with you nice folks
no more than five minutes

143
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,189
and I'm already
knee-deep in devils.

144
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:42,193
She's an old, old house,
this one, yeah.

145
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,463
Well...

146
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,199
We should be off.
We're in a bit of a hurry.

147
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,534
- So soon?
- Yes, yes.

148
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:52,503
We were just driving into
town and saw your light

149
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:53,971
and wanted to stop by.

150
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,207
Well, feel free to
stop by anytime.

151
00:17:56,209 --> 00:18:00,211
Oh, thank you, thank you.
We will.

152
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,214
You take care of this old place.

153
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,484
It needs a family.

154
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,120
Thanks, Dave.

155
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,155
It has been 30 years

156
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:14,225
since we've had fresh souls
in the Dagmar House.

157
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:17,128
I think we can call it
the Sacchetti House now.

158
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,198
Yeah, well, it's...

159
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,135
it's still Dagmar's House.

160
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,337
Come on, Cat.

161
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,545
Cat, come on.

00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,357
You can feel it, can't you?

172
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,825
Of course, I can.

173
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:38,329
It's hot as hell down here,
Mr. Sacchetti.

174
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,264
What do you got over there?

175
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:43,934
Old foundation,
needs to be replaced.

176
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,537
Nothing back there?

00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:50,841
No.

178
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:52,109

I'll give you call out

Thanks, Joe.
You're a life saver.

183
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,667
All right.

184
00:21:59,668 --> 00:22:01,551
- Just give me shout.
- Yeah.

185
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:14,665
Hey, kiddo.

186
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,567
How are we doing?

187
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,436
Not bad.

00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:24,075
Minus last night,
has the weirdness died down?

189
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,077
It's not weirdness.

190
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,714
You know what I mean.

191
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,849
Yeah.

192
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:36,420
I still feel something here.

193
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,260
So what are we
going to do about it?

194
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:46,397
What if Jacob and May
came up for the weekend?

195
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:48,733
May has always been
interested in this stuff.

196
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,502
She told me once that
people pay her to do séances.

197
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:54,171
People with too much money.

198
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,439
And you like Jacob.

199
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,842
- He is always so...
- Stoned?

200
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,944
Earthy.

201
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:03,414
And they wrote us that
lovely note after the accident.

202
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:07,418
They said they'd
always be there for us.

203
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,819
I just think they
might be able to help.

204
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:13,758
You already invited them,
didn't you?

205
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,893
Yeah.

They told me if we
were okay with it,

212
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,916
they'd invite Harry
up for the weekend, too.

213
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,686
Why would Harry want to spend
a weekend with his parents

214
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:51,489
and the parents of
his dead room...

215
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:57,628
Sorry.
That was rude.

216

I don't care if you have
to disconnect the boiler,

a really old boiler...</i>

I want it fixed.

Thank you.

230
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,125
Do you want me to call
Jacob and May

231
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,226
and tell them not to come?

232
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,629
No.
It's alright.

233
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,631
Just tell them
it might get a bit chilly

234
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,866
if the boiler does crap out.

235
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,802
I'm sure they'll be fine.

236
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:47,638
Yeah, just throw a little
more Maui Wowie on the fire,

237
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,673
they'll be fine.

238
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:52,343
I need a whiskey.
You want one?

Sure.

00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:02,286
It'll be nice having May here.

Yeah, but why?

254

She says the house
has a strange aura.

255

Ever since they moved in,

256
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,777
she feels Bobby's there
watching them.

00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,745
Well, maybe it's
nice Bobby is there.

258
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:05,449
I mean, after the crash,
Anne was in such a bad place.

259
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:07,551
I mean, if Bobby's up there
with her, maybe that's...

I don't know.
It's kind of sweet.

261
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:13,724
If Bobby is still with them,
it means he is not letting go.

262
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:17,161
They want us up there to
help find out what's going on.

263
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,629
Okay.

264
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,532
Well, you can't make me believe
that Paul is buying any of this.

265
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,567
I mean, I just feel like there
could be a lot of negative

266
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:27,438
energy if we get there and we
all get off on the wrong foot.

267
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,374
I mean, I just don't want Annie
thinking that we're gonna

268
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:34,278
walk in there and just
start waving, you know,

269
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,783
dark crystals around
and exorcise the demons.

270

We're just company.
We're not going to say anything.

Yeah.

287
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,901
It will be good
to see him again.

That's why we wanted him here.

00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,148
Bobby was so wonderful.

293
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,119
We think about him
all the time, Annie.

No way.

We're just going to

They really believe in
that stuff, don't they?

314
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,033
Oh, yeah.

315
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,669
And since Bobby and I were
roommates freshman year,

316
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:57,441
they figured, you know, we
got some sort of connection.

317
00:32:57,443 --> 00:33:00,844
What happened to Bobby?

Car crash,
about two months back.

319
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,616
He was just on his way
home from school

320
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,586
and got hit by a flatbed.

inhale their scotches

00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:41,284
give us this story about the
old owner being run out of town

330
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:45,789
for selling corpses
and then killing himself.

331
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,324
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

332
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:49,059
Hang on.

333
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,793
Your house has a
history like this

334
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:54,798
but you still think the energy
you're feeling is Bobby's?

335
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,680
[glass breaks]
[crowd silences]

336
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:08,245
Is it me
or is this bizarre?

337
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,313
Very.

338
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:25,929
This must be the place.

339
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:27,597
[honks horn]

340
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,344
We can grab the bags later.

341
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,381
Let's see what they're up to.

342
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,119
Are you sure this place
doesn't freak you out?

343
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:51,154
Hey, when you've been
around kooks like my folks

344
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,823
as long as I have?

345
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:54,691
No way.

346
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,363
Let's see.

347
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:03,733
"Kiddos, early dinner

on Central Avenue.

00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,472
Stop by if you're hungry
or make yourself at home.

350
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:09,906
Icebox is stocked.

00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,976
Love, The 'Rents."

What do you think?

353
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:18,682
I just want to relax.
Let's just eat here.

354
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,417
Deal.

355
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:34,397
Relax, babe.

[music plays]

357
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,756
Any better?

358
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:01,158
Yeah.

359
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,393
Let's see.

360
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:15,739
This ought to take the edge off.

361
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:17,741
Thanks.

362
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:23,180
[wind blowing]

363
00:36:36,929 --> 00:36:40,297
I guess they don't see a lot
of new faces around here.

364
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:43,567
Well, I think we should try
to avoid pissing them off.

365
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:46,303
Apparently they have a history
of going all mob justice

366
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:49,439
on the new faces.

367
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:54,077
It's really a nice place
you picked, Paul.

368
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,980
What are friends for?

369
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:59,849
I'm just going to enjoy
my meal now.

370
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,352
Watch my back.

371
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,622
It's pretty good, though.

372
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,687
Aw, come on!

373
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,889
Move it.

374
00:37:47,232 --> 00:37:52,369
So, uh,
what do we do now?

[distant bang]

376
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,554
Hello?

00:38:12,257 --> 00:38:13,857
What?

378
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,526
I think they might be home.

379
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:18,529
Really?

380
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,597
Yeah.

[door creaks open]

00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,393
Well, nice.

383
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:06,443
Baby, what are you doing?

384
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:08,311
<i>I'm in the cellar.</i>

<i>What?!</i>

387
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:13,950
Yeah, I heard a sound.

388
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:18,221
I thought maybe a raccoon
or something was down here.

389
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:22,625
Of course, you would find the
creepiest place in this house.

390
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:27,897
Is it just me or is it, like,
majorly hot down here?

00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,370
[crackling]

392
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:36,206
Danny, you...

393
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,741
You okay?

[roaring]

00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,813
Ah!

[coughing]

00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,922
What?
Honey, are you all right?

398
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:55,024
I don't know...

Goddamn it!

Oh, fuck!

Are you going to be okay?

411
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,968
I think so.

412
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,786
I guess Harry and his
girlfriend didn't make it.

413
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:41,891
Ah, they probably just
stopped for the night.

414
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,602
Would anyone like a nightcap?

415
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:54,904
Oh, I wouldn't refuse one.

416
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,107
You do not have to
ask me twice.

417
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:04,380
Well, I gotta say,
this is one weird fucking town.

418
00:43:04,382 --> 00:43:05,915
- Paul.
- Ha!

419
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,968
No, he's right.

420
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:12,020
You guys have moved in
to one weird fucking town.

421
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:14,090
I think it was
just a little spell.

422
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,960
You know, sometimes
things get a little hazy.

423
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:17,827
Like a migraine?

424
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:21,431
Yes,
but on a spiritual level.

425
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:22,699
It's hard to describe.

426
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,801
Do you think
it could be Bobby?

427
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:27,236
I won't know until
we make contact.

428
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:31,641
Is that something that
you two regularly do?

429
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:34,611
You know, you may not
buy into it, Paulie,

430
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:37,513
but I have seen things
over the years

431
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:40,650
that would knock
your socks off.

432
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:43,686
Well, if you can disprove
my skepticism,

433
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:46,889
I will be very, very impressed.

434
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:49,726
What do you think, honey,
should we should him?

435
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:50,994
- Can you give me a moment?
- Yeah. Yeah.

436
00:43:50,996 --> 00:43:52,662
Can you give me a
moment before we begin?

437
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,797
- I just need a little time
to freshen up.
- Sure.

438
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,566
Let me show you your room.

439
00:43:56,568 --> 00:43:59,402
It's not really set up yet
but the bed's comfy.

440
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:22,492
Migraine?

441
00:44:22,494 --> 00:44:24,727
"Oh, but on a spiritual level."

442
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:25,995
Now, come on, Paul.

443
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,964
You said you'd cut
them some slack.

444
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,733
I know.

445
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:31,501
Actually, Jacob's a lot
cooler than I remember.

446
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:34,303
Still stoner,
but good guy.

447
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:36,172
No beef with him.

448
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,241
You're going to get them
set up with some fresh linens

449
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:41,210
and then we are going to go
back down to that living room

450
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:44,947
and give this a chance.

451
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:48,451
Then I'm seriously
going to need that glass.

452
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:52,388
If you promise to be civil,

453
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,724
I promise to keep pouring.

454
00:44:54,726 --> 00:44:57,293
I promise.

455
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:11,474
Long night, eh?

456
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:13,976
What'd those folks talk about?

457
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:16,446
What folks?

458
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:18,414
[scoffs]

459
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:19,916
The only folks in here
all night

460
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:23,152
who I have not known
my whole goddamn life.

461
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:27,724
Nothing really,
just the house.

462
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,992
Are all four of them
staying up there?

463
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:31,761
I think.

[slow knocking on door]

Oh, fuck's sake, will you
please go find out who it is

468
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:44,474
and tell them that we've
already turned off the ovens.

469
00:45:54,486 --> 00:45:55,585
No, we're all closed up...

Oh shit.

473
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:08,765
I didn't know you
were coming down.

474
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,299
I wouldn't have sent
the new girl to the door.

475
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,001
Yeah.

476
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:14,170
You heard they were here,
huh?

477
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:15,605
Yeah.

478
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:18,174
No thanks to you, Maddie.

479
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,143
I'm sorry, Dave.

480
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,713
What about the other couple?

481
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,081
Not much.

482
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,315
Hippies.

483
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:29,252
They were telling them
they could sense something.

484
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:33,456
Is that so?

485
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,092
And that they should leave.

486
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:41,964
Maddie, you tell me
every word they said.

487
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,067
- Maybe you should...
- Sit down!

488
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:53,409
You do realize what will
happen if they leave, don't you?

489
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,511
Yeah.

490
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:58,114
Do you really, Maddie?

491
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:00,016
Do you?

492
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:03,920
The town didn't
realized it back in '49.

493
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:07,323
And when that darkness
didn't get a new family,

494
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:12,728
it spread like plague
until it found many.

495
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,831
The Dagmars will get them.

496
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,632
After what this town
did to that family,

497
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:19,035
they'd kill God himself if
He walked into their house.

498
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:22,405
But they haven't, Maddie.

499
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:25,641
They haven't

500
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:27,677
and it's time.

501
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,045
The darkness under that house

502
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:34,917
wakes up every 30 years
like clockwork and it's hungry.

503
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:39,789
If it doesn't get a
new family this time,

504
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:43,459
it's gonna swallow this town.

505
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:46,462
Then we'll do it ourselves.

506
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:58,541
Oh!

507
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,576
Oh, I...

508
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:01,978
Sorry.

509
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,947
I mean, I thought we
were getting comfortable.

510
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,682
No, it's cool.

511
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:11,754
Just wasn't expecting you to
be so relaxed with the policy.

512
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:14,523
Yeah, I'll smoke outside.

513
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:18,327
Sorry I took so long.

514
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,963
I was feeling the most
unreal energy in the hall.

515
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:24,600
Yeah, no,
it's total unreal, right?

516
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:26,435
Are you comfortable?

517
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:28,371
Yeah.

518
00:48:33,845 --> 00:48:36,979
There is a real power
in this house.

519
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:39,148
It's a heavy power.

520
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:44,620
Something that was born
out of decades of secrets.

521
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:45,988
There is a darkness here.

522
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,859
Yeah.
I mean, it's here.

523
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:52,461
I don't feel Bobby here.

524
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:56,866
It's something that wants
you to believe it's Bobby.

525
00:48:56,868 --> 00:48:58,968
What?

526
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,504
What does that mean?

527
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:06,442
This house has an
energy all its own.

528
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:10,146
So are we going to have
a séance or something?

529
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:12,198
No, no.

530
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,399
- I means, that depends on...
- Depends on what?

531
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,820
You said you knew
how to contact him.

532
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:20,323
Annie brought you up here to
find out what was in this house.

533
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:22,175
- Paul...
- No.

534
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:24,026
May, you can't give Annie
all this hope

535
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:26,028
and then not deliver
on anything at all.

536
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,532
We don't need to find
the darkness here, Paul.

537
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:34,036
It's everywhere.

538
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:44,113
[wind blowing]

539
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:47,750
[snoring]

540
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,031
[wind blowing]

541
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:25,321
[floor creaking]

542
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:35,064
Hello?

543
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:42,738
Jacob?

544
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,608
Do you need something?

545
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:49,612
May?

546
00:50:57,088 --> 00:51:00,623
[whispering]

547
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,691
No...

548
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:08,365
Hello?

549
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,700
[fire crackling]

550
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,811
[door creaks open]

551
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:27,283
[whispering]

552
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:29,718
No! No!

553
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,786
- May...
- No!

554
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:33,489
- May, May...
- There's so much death!

555
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:37,460
Annie.
Annie, wake up.

556
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:38,861
Annie!

557
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,230
Annie!

558
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:45,367
[screaming]

559
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:50,473
You're alright.
You're alright.

560
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:52,141
You're alright.

561
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:55,177
<i>- You're okay.</i>
<i>- </i> Bobby?

562
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,314
Did you hear that?

563
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:06,655
[wind blowing]

564
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:34,049
We had, uh...

565
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:36,852
We had an encounter last night.

566
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:41,690
Yeah, I, uh...

567
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,926
You what, Paul?

568
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:49,365
I saw something, too.

569
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:55,171
I don't know what I saw, I just
want to know what's going on.

570
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:57,740
Well, I heard Bobby.

571
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:06,081
I need some air.

572
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:08,250
Um, I have to go out
and get some groceries.

573
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:09,852
You should come along.

574
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:12,288
The boys can stay here.

575
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,957
A little male-bonding
might do them good.

576
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,492
You guys think you
can handle that?

577
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:18,427
Yeah.

578
00:53:18,429 --> 00:53:20,529
What do you think
we're going to do, baby?

579
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:24,233
Start conducting a séance
the second you leave?

580
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:27,203
Go on.
Go on.

581
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:32,775
Here are the keys,
if you want to drive.

582
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:34,877
I'll drive.

583
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,111
Not my car, she won't.

584
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:38,581
Don't worry.
We can take May's car.

585
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,683
Back in an hour.

586
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:45,487
I love you.

587
00:53:46,824 --> 00:53:49,225
Oh, no-no-no.

588
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:51,460
Can we take your car?

589
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:02,972
Uh, Jake?

590
00:54:02,974 --> 00:54:05,241
Yes, Paul?

591
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,309
What's going on, dude?

592
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:12,281
We are conducting a séance.

593
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:14,750
Excuse me?

594
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:17,620
You should've seen May
last night, man.

595
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:22,358
She said she was
surrounded by death.

596
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,493
And I just heard no séance.

597
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:26,095
You think she'd
be okay with this?

598
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,697
Absolutely not,

599
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,467
which is why we're
going to do it right now.

600
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,304
Come on, man, sit.

601
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:41,310
[church bell ringing]

602
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:47,316
It felt like the weight
of the world,

603
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:49,585
just crushing my soul.

604
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:51,320
God...

605
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:55,357
There's something in that
house that feels infernal,

606
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,328
something that I've
never felt before.

607
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,130
What does that mean exactly?

608
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:04,800
Something's not right
in that house.

609
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,468
Is that so?

610
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,204
- Oh, hi, Dave.
- Hi, Annie.

611
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:11,040
And who is this
lovely young lady?

612
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:12,374
This is my friend, May.

613
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:15,210
She and her husband are visiting
with us for the weekend.

614
00:55:15,212 --> 00:55:16,945
Oh, how nice.

615
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:20,049
Well, it's an honest-to-God
pleasure, Miss May.

616
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:21,483
How's Cat doing?

617
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:24,353
Oh, she's fine, just fine.

618
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:26,322
Check-up with the doctor.

619
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:27,923
And you're...

620
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,225
Oh, just wandering the streets

621
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:33,395
and eavesdropping on
lovely young ladies.

622
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:37,533
Miss May, did I hear you
correctly saying there's, uh...

623
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:41,070
something not quite right
with Annie's house?

624
00:55:42,973 --> 00:55:44,373
I'd be surprised
if there wasn't,

625
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,508
I mean,
with that kind of past.

626
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,377
That house probably
has more demons

627
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:51,680
than the Book of Revelations.

628
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,416
Is it true
what happened up there?

629
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:57,186
Running the Dagmars out of town?

630
00:55:57,188 --> 00:56:00,456
Oh, it's true.
Hand to the Lord.

631
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,792
Because I saw a family
there last night.

632
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:07,363
You did?

633
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:14,570
May has... abilities.

634
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:17,940
Well, I'd say she
certainly does.

635
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:23,011
We need to get back, Annie.

636
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:28,417
- I'm sorry, Dave.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

637
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:30,419
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Annie.

638
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:32,921
Bye, Miss May.

639
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:46,935
So, I'm just going to read
a few lines here

640
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:53,675
and see if we can connect to
whatever is in the house, okay?

641
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:59,982
So, you just sit there and um,
maybe close your eyes

642
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:07,984
and just try to believe
what we're doing is real.

643
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:21,203
It's just so helpful
if you're in a zone.

644
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:39,354
We are addressing
any spirits here.

645
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:42,758
This house belongs
to the living.

646
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,395
Their names are Paul and Anne,

647
00:57:46,397 --> 00:57:51,533
and they have a connection
to your world.

648
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:57,539
Their son Bobby is with you.

649
00:57:57,541 --> 00:58:03,412
And if it's Bobby's spirit
that we have felt,

650
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:08,484
please, give us a sign.

651
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:15,524
[distant bang]

652
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:39,481
This house welcomes his spirit

653
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:45,120
and asks him to join us.

654
00:58:45,122 --> 00:58:50,926
And with love and compassion,

655
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:56,932
we will help him
cross to the next realm...

656
00:58:56,934 --> 00:59:00,969
and peel...

657
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,138
the skin...

658
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,040
off...

659
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:06,742
his...

660
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:08,710
bones.

661
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,680
What did you say?

662
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:16,919
It's a...
it's a welcoming.

663
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:22,591
We try to connect to
the... to the spirit

664
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:26,562
by asking them into our circle.

665
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:30,832
And so, you know,
I'm asking my son to join us.

666
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:33,468
My son.

667
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,837
Bobby.
My son.

668
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,641
Yeah.

669
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:41,677
Sorry. Sorry.

670
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:48,584
I mean, it's a sacred blessing
to those we hold dear,

671
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:54,856
and so we ask Bobby to...

672
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:58,961
rot...

673
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:00,596
like...

674
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,731
wasted... meat.

675
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:06,001
This is bullshit.
I'm done.

676
01:00:07,204 --> 01:00:09,371
- It's not Bobby.
- What?

677
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:10,606
It's not Bobby!

678
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,708
[wind blows]

679
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:14,876
Ah!

680
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:28,023
[distorted]
Your boy is dead.

681
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:37,566
He's in the cellar.

682
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:42,371
He and his little whore.

683
01:00:46,377 --> 01:00:51,313
They're downstairs burning.

684
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,849
The both of them.

685
01:00:55,753 --> 01:01:02,658
Burning like my whole family.

686
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,095
Burning until the stars go dark.

687
01:01:10,601 --> 01:01:12,234
Fuck! Paul!

688
01:01:12,236 --> 01:01:13,953
Paul!

689
01:01:13,954 --> 01:01:15,671
- Paul, tie me up, man!
- Are you nuts?!

690
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:18,040
Get a rope or something, man!

691
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:20,308
Hurry up, man!

692
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:22,077
Tie me up!

693
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:24,946
Ah!

694
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:39,728
What is it?

695
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,296
That Dave?

696
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,699
He seems a little off.

697
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:46,468
He's just a harmless old man.

698
01:01:49,406 --> 01:01:51,573
I still don't see Harry's car.

699
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,709
May, don't worry about it.

700
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:55,744
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

701
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:58,246
I don't want them
coming up here.

702
01:01:58,248 --> 01:02:00,315
None of us should
be staying here, Annie.

703
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:02,451
May...

704
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:21,803
Help!

705
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:23,505
Help!
It's Jacob.

706
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:26,441
May, I believe it, all of it.
Help!

707
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:31,113
Jacob?

708
01:02:33,484 --> 01:02:34,683
What's going on?

709
01:02:34,685 --> 01:02:36,284
Jacob, he lit some candles

710
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:38,153
and he started digging up
some weird...

711
01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:40,856
- I don't know, auras or
something after you left...
- Auras?!

712
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:42,691
Whatever the fuck
they're called, May!

713
01:02:42,693 --> 01:02:43,959
Look at him!

714
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,328
[grunting]

715
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:03,044
Why, he's right!

716
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:07,215
Dug up some devils
while you were out.

717
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:14,389
What happened?

718
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:18,393
This town is what happened.

719
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:27,803
This is my house.

720
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:32,174
He's...

721
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:32,874
Dagmar.

722
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:34,276
[phone ringing]

723
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:35,278
What do we do?

724
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:44,853
What?

725
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:46,822
I told you to leave.

726
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,857
<i>It's Dagmar!
He's real!</i>

727
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:51,927
Dagmar...

728
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:57,532
isn't what you need
to be worried about...

729
01:03:57,534 --> 01:04:00,101
<i>Fuck you!</i>

730
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,674
- Liar!
- May!

731
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,576
He's not dead!

732
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:09,010
He's dead.

733
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:14,516
He and that little harlot he
brought into my happy home.

734
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:18,119
My son's not dead!

735
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:21,423
May.

736
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:27,128
[weeping]

737
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:30,733
No!

738
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:38,707
Jacob?

739
01:04:38,709 --> 01:04:41,877
Talk to him, May!
He's got to be in there!

740
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:44,546
This is my house.

741
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:46,748
You should have known better.

742
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,851
Jacob,
baby, are you in there?

743
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:52,587
You've got to listen
to my voice.

744
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:55,390
I need you to concentrate.

745
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,425
Think about me.

746
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:58,894
Think about us.

747
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,195
Oh shit.

748
01:05:01,198 --> 01:05:04,065
After what you did to
the people of this town?

749
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:06,001
What?!

750
01:05:06,904 --> 01:05:08,770
After what I did?!

751
01:05:08,772 --> 01:05:11,006
You're going to listen
to that old bastard?!

752
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:14,175
We were good people!

753
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:17,913
This town murdered my family!

754
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:20,682
They sacrificed them
to the gods they dug up

755
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,617
when they built this place!

756
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,454
Nobody knew what was under this
house until it was too late.

757
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:27,289
Jacob!

758
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:30,158
You've got to listen
to my voice!

759
01:05:34,031 --> 01:05:41,236
They opened something awful
and it needed a family.

760
01:05:41,238 --> 01:05:42,771
I love you.

761
01:05:42,773 --> 01:05:46,641
Please, fight it.

762
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:50,712
This is my house.

01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:55,050
Ah!

01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:05,894
Oh, no, no.
Oh God.

Oh, May,
don't look at him!

01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:12,701
We got to leave!
We got to go!

Did you hear that?

781
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:03,986
Yeah.

782
01:07:03,987 --> 01:07:05,720
It was Bobby!

783
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:06,888
Come on, Annie,
you were right.

784
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,590
- We got to keep moving.
- That was our son!

785
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:09,791
I know!
I heard him

786
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:12,627
and he told us
to fucking leave!

787
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:34,015
You see anything?

788
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:35,316
Nothing.

789

They're upstairs!

Why?

Something special about them?

You wanted this house so bad
you were willing to kill for it

so we just let you.

had that kept you here,

Well, well,
it's my new neighbors.

829
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:30,078
Come in, come in.

830
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,048
- What do you want?
- Back up.

831
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:41,422
It's not what I want.
It's what this house wants.

832
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:43,758
You're not leaving here.

833
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,161
You stay,
you satisfy the darkness.

834
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,830
And really,
why would you want to go

835
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:52,133
and leave your little boy
here all alone, huh?

836
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:55,336
Annie, you know
he is very much here.

837
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:58,272
You brought him with you
when you moved in.

838
01:12:58,274 --> 01:13:02,343
Now is your chance
to be with him always.

839
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:04,412
- Oh, fuck you, old man!
- Paul!

840
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:07,148
Paul, look at your wife.

841
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,350
Go on, look at her, man.

842
01:13:09,352 --> 01:13:12,153
He's your son.

843
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:15,123
You know it's for the best.

844
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:17,458
Don't fight it.

845
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,461
Just accept it.

846
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:23,898
You see what happens
when you try to fight it?

847
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,433
Huh?

848
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:32,106
Every 30 years or so the
goddamn place just wakes up

849
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:36,377
and it demands new blood,

850
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:39,680
and our town is forced
to deliver it.

851
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:44,085
[sizzling]
[gurgling]

852
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:47,455
Ah!

853
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:03,704
Ah!

854
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,874
[fire crackling]

855
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:51,619
[door creaks open]

856
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:56,757
[wind blows]

857
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:07,068
<i>Don't be afraid, Mom.</i>

858
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:09,103
<i>I'm here.</i>

859
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:23,851
They're still here.

860
01:15:29,926 --> 01:15:32,260
[distant whispering]

861
01:15:48,344 --> 01:15:50,611
Annie.

862
01:15:53,116 --> 01:15:55,283
Annie.

863
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:27,048
Hey, Bobby.

864
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:36,657
[wind blowing]

865
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,631
