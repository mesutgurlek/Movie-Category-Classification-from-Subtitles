you were taken into...

644
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:44,119
Yeah, I was.
But I escaped.

645
00:58:44,121 --> 00:58:47,189
I was holed up in a house
in the suburbs

646
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:50,993
and then I found a car,
so I came here.

Julie, are you sure
nothing bit you?

I'm fine, though.

They chased me out.

664
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,351
Came to find you.

665
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,319
Where is she?

666
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:26,154
Went home.

This is gonna sound
really crazy, but

01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:20,248
I think the dead
are coming back to life.

They're...

878
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:27,955
I don't know.
They're somehow
curing themselves.

You think they're curing
themselves? How is that?

No. You know what is
happening, Julie?

is every day

there are more of them
and less of us.

It will be okay.

968
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:09,109
R?

969
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:32,399
R!

970
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:35,135
R, please?

971
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,238
You okay?

972
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,373
Yeah.
Yeah?

973
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,132
Whoa.

(GASPS)

976
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:33,827
Next one's the head.
Move away from him, Julie.

977
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:35,462
JULIE: No!

978
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,431
Julie, move now.

979
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:39,566
Dad, you have
to listen to me.

980
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:44,104
I know we lost everybody.

981
01:25:44,106 --> 01:25:47,307
I know you lost Mom.
But you and me,
we are still here.

982
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:52,446
We can fix all this.
We can start over.

983
01:25:53,114 --> 01:25:54,615
They need our help.

984
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:59,853
Please, Dad!
Look at him.

985
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:01,855
He's different.
He's...

986
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,760
Bleeding.

987
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:10,898
He's bleeding, Dad.

988
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:16,503
Corpses don't bleed!

989
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:18,906
Oh, God.

990
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:23,477
You're alive. He's alive!

991
01:26:24,812 --> 01:26:25,979
(JULIE LAUGHS)

992
01:26:25,981 --> 01:26:27,614
You're alive.

993
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:31,285
Does it hurt?

994
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,287
Yeah.

995
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:35,389
Yeah?

996
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:38,559
Sir?

997
01:27:00,181 --> 01:27:03,917
This is Colonel Grigio.
The situation has changed.

998
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:16,630
Let's get you two
the hell out of here.

999
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:42,556
Are you still bleeding?

1000
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:45,759
Yes.

1001
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:46,693
Good.

1002
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,864
Sorry.

<i>Like, a lot.</i>

1005
01:27:54,837 --> 01:27:58,505

1006
01:27:58,507 --> 01:27:59,573

1017
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:32,039
<i>Well, we kind of learned</i>

Yeah.

1030
01:29:49,617 --> 01:29:52,452
I have, uh,
zombie fingers.

Thank you.

Here.

1033
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:03,930
Oh, it's okay.
I don't mind the rain.

1034
01:30:03,932 --> 01:30:04,731
I insist.

You're very pretty.

Thank you, Marcus.

1040

Now you're supposed
to say I'm pretty, too.

R?

1042

Yeah?

1043
01:30:37,733 --> 01:30:39,166
Do you remember
your name yet?

1044
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:41,501
No.

1045
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:46,373
Well, you know,
you could just
give yourself one.

1046
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:48,909
Just pick one.
Whatever you want.

1047

I like "R."

Really?

1049

You don't want to know
what it was?

1050
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,022
You don't want
your old life back?

1051
01:31:02,024 --> 01:31:03,123
No.

1052
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:05,859
I want this one.

Just "R."
