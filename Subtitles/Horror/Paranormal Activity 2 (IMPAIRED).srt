1
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:18,852
[girl] Welcome home, Hunter.
This is your house.

2
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,806
Gonna look out of that window.
There's your front door.

3
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,058
Hi, Dad.

4
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,943
How are you?

5
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,062
- [woman] Happy.
- [girl] Hi, little man.

6
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,063
[Dad] We got to keep him
out of the sun, too, OK?

7
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:32,282
[girl] Yeah.
How are you feeling?

8
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,784
[Dad] Guess who changed
the first, like, 15 diapers?

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,236
- This guy, right here.
- Wait, wait.

10
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,238
Guess who was in labor
for a day?

11
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:39,489
- This girl.
- I've been in labor for...

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,074
- Hi.
- [girl] That's your mama.

13
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:44,127
Hi. Hunter, this is Martine,
your new nanny.

14
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,129
She will probably
fix your dirty diapers

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,130
- because I won't.
- [Martine] Can I see?

16
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,832
[Dad] Yes.

17
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:50,583
Oh, my goodness. Look at this.

18
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,335
- [girl] He's cute, right?
- Isn't he adorable?

19
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:55,638
[girl] He's kind of smooshy
looking. I'm not gonna lie.

20
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,424
He's just newborn,
he's a newborn...

21
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,009
[girl] Seriously,
the cutest baby ever,
next to me. Second to me.

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,062
Just touch him
and cuddle him all day long.

23
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,064
[Dad] You see how tiny he is?

24
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,150
Do you mind if I take him?
Not if he's sleeping,

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,902
but I want to take him
on a tour of the house.

26
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,905
Mm. OK. He's not sleeping.

27
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,241
[Dad] That's Abby.
Gonna be your best friend.

28
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,659
Bye, sweetie.

29
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:20,747
This is a fireplace.
This is how Mommy seduced
Daddy...

30
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,700
- [mother] Oh.
- [Dad] ...and that's
how we got you.

31
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,252
And that's why you're watching
this video at 25.

32
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,787
[Dad] This is your room.

33
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,841
There's your crib.
It's a little sparse right now.

34
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,343
Just got some
caterpillar action going on.

35
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,713
"Hunter." See? Pretty cool.

36
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,798
This is your sister's
trashed room.

37
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,267
- [girl] No, I'll
check with him.
- [Dad] Oh, there she is.

38
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,553
Wassup, brother
from another mother?

39
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,555
- [Dad] What?
- No, Hunter's in...

40
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:49,359
You're never allowed to come in
here, ever. Unless I invite you.

41
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,111
In which case, it's gonna be
the best day of your life.

42
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,446
By the way, that's my bathroom.
Don't ever go in there.

43
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,647
[Dad] That's half your bathroom.

44
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,699
It's actually my bathroom,
'cause I bought it.

45
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,202
All that is mine.
Don't pee on my seat!

46
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,987
[Dad] This is the living room
that no one ever uses.

47
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:03,956
This is my first man cave.

48
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,658
That's where all
my genius ideas come.

49
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,209
This is the second man cave,

50
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,461
where we're gonna watch
Chargers games together.

51
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:13,632
This is my 50-inch monster.
Look at that. It's beautiful.

52
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,085
- [mother cooing]
- [Hunter crying]

53
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:20,089
I don't even know
if I swaddled him right.

54
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,508
It's just... Yeah.

55
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,648
Hi, baby boy. Hi. Hi.

56
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,353
- [girl] He smells good.
- Yes. [kissing sounds]

57
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:37,606
- [mother laughs]
- You're just like Daddy.

58
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:41,110
You make poops all the time.

59
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,579
[speaking Spanish]

60
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:48,283
- Is that good?
-S?.

61
00:02:48,283 --> 00:02:49,835
[chuckling] OK.

62
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:54,339
Is a special baby??

63
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,759
[singing in Spanish]

64
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,762
- Thank you.
- [Dad] That is so cute.

65
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,463
- [doorbell rings]
- [girl] I'll get it!

66
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:08,637
- Hey! Let me see this baby.
- [girl] Hi!

67
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:09,972
- [girl] Aunt Katie!
- [whispering] Where is he?

68
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:11,607
[girl] He's upstairs.

69
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:15,060
[Katie] Hi.

70
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:20,566
Hi. Hi.

71
00:03:20,816 --> 00:03:24,069
[whispering] You are so
precious.

72
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,822
Hi. [chuckles]

73
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:30,793
I already love you so much.

74
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:32,795
- My sister did good.
- [Dad] Yeah.

75
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,546
You probably had a little
part in it, I don't know.

76
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,415
- [Dad] Very little.
- Hi.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,586
[Dad] It's her boyfriend.
Yeah, he's a big boy,
just like his...

78
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:43,172
[girl] Kinda just
eating cookies.

79
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:45,224
[Katie] Hello, baby.

80
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:47,176
- [girl] Dad, my burger?
- Or whatever.

81
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:49,178
- Right, sorry.
- [girl] Gimme another plate.

82
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:55,984
- [girl] Nice.
- Did you get that?

83
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,186
[girl] I want you to meet...

84
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:58,687
- Wait.
- ...my Aunt Katie.

85
00:03:58,854 --> 00:04:00,022
Does it stay on?

86
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:01,774
[boy] It does stay on,
but I didn't want to get it wet.

87
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,777
Oh, no, of course not.
That would be ridiculous.

88
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:06,528
- That would ruin it.
- [Katie] That is so...

89
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:08,997
- Swear to God, I will kill you.
- [boy] Look at that, perfect.

90
00:04:08,997 --> 00:04:10,499
Perfect handoff right there.

91
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:11,917
She's my only niece.

92
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:13,669
Not really, but I think of her
as my niece.

93
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:14,670
She's my step-niece.

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,921
- [boy] Aww.
- [feigns evil laugh]

95
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:18,674
- I'm the evil step-aunt.
- Step?

96
00:04:18,674 --> 00:04:21,176
[boy] The evil step-aunt?
I'm not sure how to take that.
I'm not sure...

97
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:23,178
Well, I'm not really evil,
but I can be evil is my point.

98
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:26,098
- [grunts playfully]
- [Ali laughs] Dad,
the face came off!

99
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,519
- [grunting]
- [girl laughing]

100
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,105
- There can be only one!
- I will not let you go.

101
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:35,607
[mother] I can't believe
he's over a year old.

102
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,278
- [girl] Where's Micah?
- Oh, he, um...

103
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,948
He wasn't up
for hanging out today.

104
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,451
[mother] I can't find the tape.

105
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:48,537
[Dad] That's fine, I'm just
gonna tape over an old one.

106
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:50,789
Can you get Abby out of here,
please? She's gonna get cut on
the glass!

107
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,575
We just got back and the whole
place has been just destroyed.

108
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:56,077
Nothing seems to be missing.
It's just, everything's
really...

109
00:04:56,294 --> 00:04:57,746
But that's what
she's telling me.

110
00:04:58,046 --> 00:05:00,298
Make sure we document
everything. Don't touch
anything.

111
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:03,385
[Dad] This is our foyer.
The furniture's damaged.

112
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:05,220
My daughter Ali's room.

113
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:10,892
It just feels... gross
that somebody was in here.

114
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:12,644
[Dad] Master bedroom.

115
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:16,314
Yeah, so that's great.

116
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:20,936
- Your watches are still there?
- [mother] Yeah.
Diamonds are here.

117
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:25,740
The only thing missing
is the necklace
my sister made me.

118
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:27,993
[Dad] Oh, sweetie.

119
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:30,245
This is horrible.
It's fucking horrible.

120
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:34,499
[Dad] It's the nursery.

121
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,751
[sighs] As far as I know,
this room was not touched.

122
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:44,009
[Dad] This is our basement.

123
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,512
I don't see anything really
broken. I don't know if
there's anything...

124
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,181
[Ali] I don't think they
did anything down here. I...

125
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:51,266
- What is that?
- [Dad] Hm?

126
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:54,469
[Ali] Is that Abby?
It really stinks, though.

127
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:57,556
- Oh.
- [Dad] Well, clothes
are still here.

128
00:05:57,806 --> 00:05:59,357
Your bikes are still here.

129
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:01,610
- Not that you're using those.
- And your bike
is over here, so...

130
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,563
- [Ali] And the
epic clean continues.
- It's not so bad, right?

131
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,282
- This looks like
we had a party.
- [all chuckle]

132
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:11,369
- Right?
- [Ali] Worst party ever.

133
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:15,457
[sighs] I don't know, kiddo.
This is messed up.

134
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:18,710
[Ali] What are you
talking about? They didn't
take anything. We're fine.

135
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,462
- [sighs]
- [Ali] You're fine.

136
00:06:23,415 --> 00:06:26,418
So this is it. Um...
Like I said, about a week ago,

137
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,920
- the place was
completely trashed.
- [Ali] Hello.

138
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,672
- Hello.
- That's our daughter, Ali.

139
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:34,926
Pretty much every room in the
house. We had both doors locked.

140
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:36,478
Put one up here,
up in the corner,

141
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:38,480
and then you get
the whole stairway,

142
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,731
the front door,
this whole hallway.

143
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:41,316
One over there,
facing this way,

144
00:06:41,516 --> 00:06:43,068
you'd get this door
and this door.

145
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:44,319
Or have one in here,

146
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,570
getting all these
windows, the sliding...

147
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,188
[Ali] They run, like,
all the time?

148
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:48,940
Yeah, they're
always recording.

149
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,742
You can't get away
with anything.

150
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:53,528
That stuff.

151
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:55,247
Corner up there, so you get
who's coming in and out

152
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:57,249
- of this door, that door.
- Bathroom.

153
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,251
And you get to see
the baby at night, too.

154
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:01,253
[Ali] You're not putting one
in my bathroom, right?

155
00:07:01,503 --> 00:07:03,004
- Yeah. What?
- [Ali] Wait.

156
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:05,206
Put a camera that sees in
complete dark. It'd be perfect.

157
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,208
- Yeah, really?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

158
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:09,844
- Yeah, OK, that'd be sweet.
- They'll look like
motion detectors.

159
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:12,097
Little tiny hole.
I have one I could show you.

160
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:14,099
- [Ali] Can you put one
in that bunny?
- Very cool.

161
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:15,600
[all laugh]

162
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,102
And then we can,
I can set you up with the...

163
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:20,305
Yeah, so, I'm gonna close
it up there like that.

164
00:07:20,555 --> 00:07:22,057
It's hidden.
Can't even tell it's a camera.

165
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:24,693
[Ali] How many are we getting?

166
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:27,445
I don't know. But what'd you...?
What, is that... six?

167
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:32,317
- I don't know.
- One, two, three...

168
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:45,964
[van alarm chirps]

169
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:17,028
[crickets chirring]

170
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:48,059
[crickets chirring]

171
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:07,746
What are you doing
out here, little buddy?

172
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:18,306
[Abby whining]

173
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:25,230
[Ali] Yeah. Go get it.

174
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:29,734
You're super fast, big man.

175
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,269
What's Martine doing?

176
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:32,771
What is she doing?

177
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,523
[Martine speaking Spanish]

178
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:39,778
- [Ali chuckles]
He's good, right?
- [Martine speaks Spanish]

179
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:44,783
[Ali] You're a good puppy.
What you say, Abby?

180
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,869
Hey, Hunter. Hunter,
you want another fishy?

181
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:52,924
What are you doing?
What you doing?

182
00:09:52,924 --> 00:09:55,343
What's up, Martine?

183
00:09:55,593 --> 00:10:00,348
- Wassup? What's up, Ali?
- [both laughing]

184
00:10:00,348 --> 00:10:03,384
[Ali] What were you doing?
What were you doing earlier?

185
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:06,888
When you were, like,
talking to yourself?

186
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:09,891
All crazy like.
Are you going crazy here, too?

187
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:11,643
No... crazy.

188
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:12,894
[Ali] You're just
getting it from all of us.

189
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:14,529
[speaks Spanish]

190
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,531
[Ali] The house is...
There are bad things
in the house?

191
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:19,067
No. [speaks Spanish]

192
00:10:19,317 --> 00:10:20,568
- [Ali] You're getting
rid of spirits.
- Uh-huh.

193
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:24,572
- [Ali] OK. All right.
- [speaks Spanish]

194
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:28,326
- The good ones...
- [speaks Spanish]

195
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,078
- [Ali] We keep the good ones.
- Yes.

196
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:32,080
[Ali] In with the good,
out with the bad.

197
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,581
Yay!

198
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:36,584
In with the paella,
out with the...

199
00:10:36,584 --> 00:10:38,586
Holy crap,
that's a lot of garlic.

200
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,505
- Whee!
- [Dad laughs]

201
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:43,257
One, two, three. Whee!

202
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,977
- [Dad laughs]
- One, two, three.

203
00:10:45,977 --> 00:10:47,512
[gasps] Whee!

204
00:10:47,729 --> 00:10:49,514
[Dad] Oh, I almost got him.

205
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:50,932
- One, two...
- [Ali screams]

206
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:56,688
Oh, my God!
Look at what Martine left!

207
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:58,656
- [Dad] Oh!
- [Ali] Disgusting!

208
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,441
I wanna throw up! It...

209
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:02,110
- [Dad laughs] Ohh!
- She put it in the freaking...

210
00:11:02,443 --> 00:11:05,163
- [Dad] No, you! That was you!
- It's not me!

211
00:11:05,163 --> 00:11:06,914
- [Dad] Don't blame
somebody else!
- Hand to God!

212
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:09,450
[Dad] God, there was like
a live crawdaddy in there.

213
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:11,619
- She clogged it. I can't look.
- [Dad] That is a stench-ilada.

214
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:14,455
- That is horrible.
You're grounded.
- [Ali] I'm not capable of...

215
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:16,207
[Dad] You are grounded. Awful.

216
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:18,459
This is the best bath...

217
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:21,262
- [Dad] It looks pretty good.
- ...I've... I think it...

218
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:24,265
Well, if you come in,
it'll be the best bath
I've ever...

219
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:28,603
It's so quiet and, like,
there's nobody here.
It's fantastic.

220
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:32,357
[Dad] I love Martine, but
I'm kind of loving the fact
that she's not here.

221
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:34,859
- Yeah.
- [Dad] What time
is your sister coming?

222
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:38,863
Um... What time is it now?

223
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:41,366
[Dad] 7:20. Something like that.

224
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:45,620
- Oh, like an hour or so.
- [Dad] Hm.

225
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,904
You should definitely pop in.

226
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:49,624
[Dad] I don't want to smash you,
but I kind of want to get in.

227
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:51,909
You don't want to smash me?
I kinda want you to smash me.

228
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:54,162
- [Dad] Really? Oh.
- Yeah.

229
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:57,965
- Let me release the Kraken.
- [laughs]

230
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:13,097
[crickets chirring]

231
00:12:30,114 --> 00:12:32,617
[Hunter crying]

232
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,122
Hey.

233
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:42,126
You're OK.

234
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,633
Aw. Aw. I gotcha.

235
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:51,853
You're OK. You're OK.

236
00:12:51,853 --> 00:12:53,855
[Dad] Look, it's perfect, right?

237
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:57,024
- [Ali] That's a lot
of grease in there.
- [Dad] I'm gonna drain it.

238
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,610
[Ali] Here, goofy mug.

239
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:01,612
[Dad] Do you need anything?

240
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:04,398
- [Ali] Hey!
- Mm, are you making breakfast?

241
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,401
- Thank you so much.
- How you doing?

242
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:09,153
- I was, but, uh...
-Hola.

243
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:11,205
- [Dad] Did he keep you up?
- Yeah, yeah.

244
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:12,957
- He definitely kept me up.
- [Dad] Yeah, he does that.

245
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:14,408
I love you so much.

246
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:17,161
- I love you so much.
- Thank you so much.

247
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:19,163
- I love you so much.
- [Ali] Aw.

248
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,666
You're amazing. I don't think
I'm really awake yet, though.

249
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,917
There's coffee.

250
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:25,419
? I love my sister
She's the best ?

251
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,671
[Hunter cries]

252
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:28,556
[Ali] Remember that time
you tried to be a vegan

253
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:31,893
- for like six hours?
- A day and a half?

254
00:13:31,893 --> 00:13:33,644
- That was a difficult time.
- It was for one meal.

255
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:35,897
- Making bacon?
- Yeah. [laughs]

256
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:37,815
- Good morning.
- [Ali] Yo, yo, yo, what up?

257
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,818
Thank you for loaning out
your beautiful girlfriend
for the night.

258
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:43,571
- [Ali] What up?
- She made my day.

259
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:47,825
- Tell me that's not yours.
- [Ali] It's not
really mine, no.

260
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,076
[Dad] Thanks for not watching
the sausage for us, Ali.

261
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,328
[Ali] I did watch it!

262
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:51,829
[mother] It's mine and hers.
She uses it most.

263
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,031
Cool. It's HD.
Do I get some love, too?

264
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:56,367
- [Katie grunts]
- [Ali] What?

265
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:59,120
- [Hunter cries]
- [Katie] You scared
little Hunter.

266
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,005
[Hunter continues crying]

267
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:03,257
How's it going?
Can I get you some coffee?

268
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:05,543
- Dude, I have a bone
to pick with you.
- [Dad] Yeah?

269
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:08,296
I went into Burger King,
and I was like, hey, man.

270
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:11,299
I tossed your name around
and they didn't give me
any free food, dude.

271
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:15,303
- I don't own, like,
every Burger King.
- [all laughing]

272
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:19,307
- [mother] He's not actually
the king of Burger King.
- I'm not?

273
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:22,276
I'm still in the process
of easing him in to the fact
that we live together

274
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:24,278
and, therefore, the house should
represent the both of us.

275
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:27,532
Well, yeah, but the both
of us, like, a give and take.

276
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:29,483
Like you have your beading thing
or whatever it is,

277
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,536
and then I have my area,
you know?

278
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,538
- The whole rest of the house?
- [Ali] Of manliness.

279
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:36,407
[mother] I'm telling you,
that baby's gonna be
a rock star when he grows up.

280
00:14:36,657 --> 00:14:41,245
[Ali] Yeah, get it. Whoa!
Dad, careful, are you
watching that?

281
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:43,297
There was no sign
of forced entry, but...

282
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,551
They trashed our whole house.
I mean, I think it was more
vandalism.

283
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:48,836
See that thing in the corner?
Looks like a motion detector?

284
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:51,589
- Are you, like...?
- [Dad] That's a camera.

285
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:54,225
[Ali, sing-song]
We're watching you!

286
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:57,478
[mother] You like
little wheels that roll.

287
00:14:57,812 --> 00:15:02,567
[laughs] You're such a ham.
Such a ham. Are you leaving?

288
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,318
[mother] Things have gotten
a little difficult

289
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:05,820
since he learned how
to open the door.

290
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,321
- Aw.
- [both laugh]

291
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:10,524
[Katie] So are you freaked
out after the break in?

292
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:14,528
[mother] Yeah, I mean,
I definitely was. I don't
think I was sleeping very well.

293
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:16,747
Oh, sweetie? Sweetie.

294
00:15:16,998 --> 00:15:19,033
I would be freaked out,
too, if, you know,

295
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:20,534
somebody had broken
into my house.

296
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,537
[mother] Well, it's just,
they didn't take anything.
You know?

297
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:25,039
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

298
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:29,794
[mother] It seemed personal.
It feels like they're always
still here.

299
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:31,796
You know? I don't know, I...

300
00:15:31,963 --> 00:15:34,932
I get this feeling,
like when we were little.

301
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:36,684
What?

302
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,687
[mother] Mm. Never mind.

303
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:42,890
- [Hunter coos]
- Mac and cheese,

304
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,392
- mac and cheese.
- Hey, Kris?

305
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:46,644
I'm gonna go out.
I'm not gonna be in.

306
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,646
- Oh, OK. Where are you going?
- Just the mall.

307
00:15:48,646 --> 00:15:49,897
All right, well, have fun.

308
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:52,900
- [Ali] Bye!
- Bye!

309
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,870
[Kristi] Mac and cheese.
Mac and cheese.

310
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,989
- [Kristi and Hunter laugh]
- [Kristi] No?

311
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:10,334
[soft thud]

312
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,841
[thudding]

313
00:16:25,066 --> 00:16:27,568
[softly] Hey,
what's up there?

314
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:22,206
[soft thud]

315
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:20,464
[crickets chirring]

316
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:56,250
[Hunter cooing]

317
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,752
[musical toy plays]

318
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:18,439
[Ali makes ticking sounds]
Let's look at baby Hunter.

319
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:21,442
Boy, that one was bad.
That's that bee bonnet
that the...

320
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:24,945
[Ali] He's like, that was
totally humiliating.
Nobody needs to see this.

321
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:26,697
- Oh, this is crazy.
- [Ali] What?

322
00:19:26,697 --> 00:19:28,916
- Who do you think that is?
- [Ali] Is that you?

323
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,669
No, that's your Aunt Katie.
That's...

324
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:33,170
- [Ali] That's Katie?
- That's so weird.

325
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,923
I thought we lost all
our pictures in the fire.

326
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:37,708
That's great.

327
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:43,681
[Martine speaks Spanish]

328
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:46,732
- [Ali] Yo, Martine?
- Uh-huh.

329
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:48,317
[Ali] Kristi and Dad
are out tonight.

330
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,319
- I'm going out tonight.
- Uh-huh.

331
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,571
[Ali] You gonna have your
boyfriend over? Have a party?

332
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:54,790
- [speaking Spanish]
- [Ali] Yeah.

333
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,209
-EsteBrad.Novio.
- [Ali] Yeah.

334
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:58,544
He, he boy.

335
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:01,547
- ...want handsy,
handsy, touchy. No.
- [Ali laughing]

336
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:02,998
"No."

337
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:05,300
- [Ali] The handsy,
handsy, touchy?
- The handsy-handsy?.

338
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,753
Is that the kind of dance you
were showing me, the Handsy?

339
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:10,055
Shake it.

340
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:12,307
[both laughing]

341
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:14,810

[speaking softly
in Spanish]

352
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:07,432
I thought I was gonna have
to give him the Heimlich.

353
00:23:07,432 --> 00:23:08,684
Hey, what are
you doing?

354
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:09,935
[Martine speaks Spanish]

355
00:23:10,185 --> 00:23:11,937
That's enough, Martine.
Put it down.

356
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:13,438
[Kristi] Martine,
he's fine.

357
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:15,440
[Dad] I've asked you
not to do this, OK?

358
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,692
It is not good
for the baby.

359
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:19,161
- Please, put it out right now.
- [Martine continues]

360
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:21,446
[Dad]No m?s, no m?s.
That's enough.

361
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:24,199
Put it out right now, please.

362
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:28,370
- OK, that's enough.
- [speaking Spanish]

363
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:30,372
What are you doing?

364
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:32,874
- The baby is fine, OK?
- No, no.

365
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,627
The baby should not
be breathing that.
Nobody should.

366
00:23:35,877 --> 00:23:37,379
- [Martine continues in Spanish]
- No, I don't...

367
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:39,631
Just stop doing it, please.

368
00:23:41,133 --> 00:23:42,884
[whispering] Goddamn it.

369

[coughs]

370
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:50,642
[whispering] God.

371
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:54,946
OK, that's like two months.
All right?

372
00:23:55,197 --> 00:23:56,448
[Martine speaks Spanish]

373

00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,961
[Martine muttering in Spanish]

376
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:13,715
I do understand, OK?
I just,

377
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:15,467
I don't believe
in that stuff, OK?

378
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,803
It's just... I cannot have that
stuff in my house. OK?

379
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:20,806
- [Martine] OK.
- [Dad] I'm sorry.

380
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:24,059
Can I give you a great
recommendation, OK?

381
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:25,560
You were very good for us.

382
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,730
- [lawnmower buzzing]
- [indistinct conversation]

383
00:24:35,237 --> 00:24:36,988
Da-da.

384
00:24:43,412 --> 00:24:47,165
Come on, make Daddy proud.
Say, "Da-da."

385
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:51,837
Hunter, look over here.

386
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:53,789
Hunter?

387
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,792
You are so like your dad.

388
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:02,764
Sweetie. Sweetie?

389
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:05,517
Come on, come on.

390
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:08,970
What are you looking at?

391
00:25:09,221 --> 00:25:11,723
- Look at Mama.
- [Hunter whining]

392
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:12,974
Look at Mama.

393
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:17,646
- [whining]
- Buddy? What? What? Oh.

394
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:20,031
Look over here.

395
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:22,033
There's nothing there, goofball.

396
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:25,203
Where are you going?
Hunter?

397
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,961
I can't see you back there.

398
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:35,413
We were up in the nursery,
playing, and I was trying

399
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:38,416
to get him to say "Da-da" again,
and he just wouldn't focus.

400
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:39,918
He was looking
at the ceiling and mirror,

401
00:25:39,918 --> 00:25:41,920
- everywhere but me.
- Well, he's a baby.

402
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,423
He's got, like, an attention
span of a guppy. You know?

403
00:25:45,423 --> 00:25:47,175
I guess, but there
was definitely

404
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:48,677
something he was
focused on,

405
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:50,178
and it wasn't
my pretty face.

406
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:54,683
- [Dad] Hey.
- What are you doing?

407
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:56,935
- What's going on?
- [Dad] Nothing much.

408
00:25:56,935 --> 00:25:58,770
Check this out.

409
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,273
- Dad, can you
please not do that?
- [Dad] Yeah, night vision.

410
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:03,775
Cool, I'm gonna get nail polish
on the bed. Please?

411
00:26:03,992 --> 00:26:05,277
You got freaky eyes.
You look like a possum.

412
00:26:05,527 --> 00:26:06,495
Dad.

413
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,997
- There we go.
- Painting my nails, Dad.

414
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:11,249
Why are you in here?
What do you want?

415
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,002
- [Dad] Sorry, crabby.
- I'm not crabby.

416
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:17,005
You're Crabby McRumpelstein.

417
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:19,758
- Why did I fire Martine?
- Yeah.

418
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:21,510
[Dad] Because I didn't like her
doing all that weird

419
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,262
- witchy stuff around Hunter.
- It wasn't witchy.

420
00:26:24,262 --> 00:26:27,516
It wasn't witchy...
It wasn't hurting anybody.

421
00:26:27,516 --> 00:26:30,268
It made her feel better,
and she wanted to make us
feel better.

422
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:33,021
She was, like, slaughtering
goats out by the pool, OK?

423
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:35,774
- [laughs] No, she wasn't.
- All right.

424
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:38,777
Good luck and it's...
Stay in the lines.

425
00:26:39,027 --> 00:26:40,529
- What? Dad!
- [Dad] Check it.

426
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:42,697
- [Ali] On! Stop!
- [Dad] Off.

427
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,534
[Dad] Let me get one more. Oh!

428
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,002
[crickets chirring]

[Kristi, indistinct]

432
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:34,783
- [Hunter cries]
- Aw, come here.

433
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:36,534
Shh.
Come here, come on.

434
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:39,537
It's OK. It's OK, buddy.
It's OK.

435
00:27:39,537 --> 00:27:41,289
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

436
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,297
[soft rattling]

437
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,063
[chuckles] Ah, no.

438
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:07,816
It's OK, buddy,
there's nothing there.

439
00:28:09,818 --> 00:28:11,569
Is that what
woke you up, buddy?

440
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:20,078
[rattling]

441
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:40,098

- [loud crash]
- [gasps]

444
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:19,471
- [muffled footsteps]
- [Kristi] Daniel!

445
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:22,474
Daniel?

446
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,728
God. Nasty.

447
00:29:26,728 --> 00:29:28,480
[Ali] Dad, don't pick it up
with your hands.

448
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,732
- [Daniel] Why not?
- [Ali] Because it could,
like...

449
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:32,450
They can have diseases
and stuff...

450
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,952
- It flew into the window...
- [Ali] It's so sad.

451
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:35,203
I don't even want to look at it.

452
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,988
- [Ali] What?
- Its neck is all broken.

453
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:38,740
[Ali] Oh, my God,
just put it in the thing!

454
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,741
I'm trying to...

455
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:40,959
[Ali] Why did you
pick it up with tong...?

456
00:29:41,126 --> 00:29:42,544
- [Ali] I don't know.
- What do you think?

457
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:44,329
- [Ali] Stop!
- Medium, medium rare?

458
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:46,664
- [Ali] You're really mean.
- It's just a dead bird.

459
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,917
- Oh.
- It was a live bird.
And then it...

460
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,169
- [Ali] It's really sad.
- OK.

461
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:54,472
[Ali] You like the ball?
You like ball?

462
00:29:55,423 --> 00:29:57,976
Ball, ball, hit it. Smack it!

463
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:01,179
What's in there? Get in.
What's in there?

464
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:02,647
- [whimpers]
- [Ali] Oh, buddy.

465
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,182
Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

466
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:09,938
Hunter? Oh, shit.

467
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:14,692
Hunter, come here! Come here.

468
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:17,946
[static crackles]

469
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:38,516
[crickets chirring]

470
00:30:59,537 --> 00:31:00,789
[loud clattering]

471
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:03,158
[pan rattling on floor]

472
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,710
- [loud clanking]
- [screams]

473
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,463
Fuck! [whimpering]

474
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:14,279
What are you doing
back out here? Go.

475
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:20,535
[Micah] Your dog does
not like pool cleaners.

476
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:22,487
Yo, what's the deal
with your dog?!

477
00:32:23,288 --> 00:32:26,241
Honestly, we're not really sure.

478
00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:31,713
Splash, splash. One, two, three.
Splash, splash, splash.

479
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:34,215
[Micah] This is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

480
00:32:34,465 --> 00:32:35,466
Splash, splash, splash.

481
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,670
[Micah] I think I might
definitely start

482
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,171
to replace my girlfriend
with this camera.

483
00:32:40,171 --> 00:32:42,173
- Uh-huh. See? We're scared.
- [Micah] It's got more
features.

484
00:32:42,423 --> 00:32:45,760
Flip the thing, film yourself.
It flips. Oh, yeah, yeah.

485
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,479
- Oh, shit.
- [Daniel] Then it shows you...

486
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:50,765
No. I'm definitely
getting one of these.

487
00:32:51,015 --> 00:32:54,018
[Micah] I'll bet you guys
go extracurricular with this.

488
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:56,020
Who has time for that?
We've got a baby.

489
00:32:56,271 --> 00:32:58,273
[Micah] How's Daniel Rey
and his brood doing?

490
00:32:58,523 --> 00:33:01,776
Oh, apparently, we have a ghost.
Did you hear about this?

491
00:33:01,776 --> 00:33:05,530
[Micah] I did not. Please
elaborate, 'cause that's
a very strange thing to...

492
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,783
A couple pots fell off our pot
hanger thing in the kitchen.

493
00:33:08,783 --> 00:33:10,785
- [Micah] You definitely
have a ghost.
- Straight to ghost.

494
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:14,005
That's the most logical...

495
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:17,008
[Daniel] She thinks everything
is, like, a ghost or a...
Don't you, honey?

496
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,760
- What?
- [Micah humming]
Duh-duh-duh-duh...

497
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,011
[Daniel] Think everything
is a ghost?

498
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:21,012
[Katie] You don't have a ghost.

499
00:33:21,012 --> 00:33:22,513
[Micah] Yeah, you're definitely
haunted.

500
00:33:22,513 --> 00:33:25,016
- No.
- [Daniel] You and your sister
are, like, freaky...

501
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:26,467
[Micah] Katie, you're
into this stuff?

502
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,469
[Daniel] You don't
know this stuff?

503
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,722
They used to do, like, séances
and shit when they were little.

504
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:32,473
- [Micah] No!
- [Daniel] Yes.

505
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:33,975
We didn't do séances.

506
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:36,227
- No.
- [Micah] Who'd you talk to?

507
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:37,729
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

508
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:40,982
- [Micah] Katie...
- Babe, it was really
no big deal.

509
00:33:40,982 --> 00:33:44,485
- [Micah] What's no big deal?
- I probably, you know,

510
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:45,737
I just don't talk about
this stuff anymore.

511
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:47,238
[Micah] What stuff?

512
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:49,490
[Daniel] They used to do séances
when they were little kids.

513
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:52,744
It's really not that funny.
You're laughing. It's not
a big deal, babe.

514
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:54,412
The truth is, when we were kids,

515
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:56,414
we got a little freaked out,
but it's really no big deal.

516
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:58,666
And we're having a good day
today, so let's just...

517
00:33:58,916 --> 00:33:59,917
[Micah] We'll explore this

518
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:01,169
- in detail later.
- Let's focus...

519
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,421
What about the Lizzie Borden
one? The axe murderer one?

520
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:06,174
[Katie] You're thinking
of every, like, childhood...

521
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,926
How, where do, how would I...
Back me up...

522
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,645
How would I know this stuff
if you didn't tell us?

523
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:13,314
[Micah] What's your take
on this ghost situation?

524
00:34:13,564 --> 00:34:14,816
I think it's awesome.

525
00:34:14,816 --> 00:34:17,265
How could I put it up wrong?
It's on a hook.

526
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:18,766
Once it goes up, it's up.

527
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:20,768
You were probably putting it

528
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:24,022
on the edge of the top part,
instead of inside.

529
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:26,774
The fact that it fell a second
time probably proves

530
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:30,278
- that you put it up
wrong both times.
- OK.

531
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:32,030
You want me to show
you how to put it up?

532
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,781
No, no, no. Then why
are you putting

533
00:34:34,032 --> 00:34:36,034
the pool cleaner
back in every morning?

534
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,535
For the last week?

535
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,287
'Cause it's a pool cleaner,
and I want it to clean the pool.

536
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:42,790
- How does it get out at night?
- [laughs] How does it get out?

537
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,042
- Yeah.
- Is it taking the car?

538
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:45,543
Is it, like...?

539
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,795
- Oh, come on, honey.
No, really.
- I don't know.

540
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:49,547
I assume somebody takes it out
when they go swimming.

541
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:51,299
I don't take it out,
and you don't take it out.

542
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:53,301
Ali, do you take the pool
cleaner out of the pool?

543
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,803
- What?
- Do you take the pool cleaner
out of the pool?

544
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:58,056
[Ali] No.

545
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:00,058
What? So it's crawling
out of the pool?

546
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:02,310
It's crawling
out of the pool by itself?

547
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,562
I don't know.
Let's... You know what?

548
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:07,565
You wanted all the cameras.
Let's go check the DVR.

549
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,817
Fine, let's go check it.

550
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:11,819
- You serious?
- Yeah, I'm very serious.

551
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,072
We'll find out what else is
going around here at night.

552
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:15,623
- Can I tape it, though?
- Yeah.

553
00:35:22,964 --> 00:35:25,717
- [Ali] What?
- [Kristi] See?

554
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:27,969
[Daniel] That is weird.

555
00:35:29,971 --> 00:35:32,173
Maybe I have it set too high
or something, I don't know.

556
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,975
[Kristi] No.

557
00:35:33,975 --> 00:35:36,978
No, I don't, I don't think
the settings are off.

558
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:48,239
[Ali giggles] Maybe
the settings are off.
Um...

559
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:49,741
That's what we got it for.

560
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:52,243
It's probably trying to be
proactive. Do the little patio.

561
00:35:52,243 --> 00:35:55,747
[Ali chuckles] It's like
one of those vacuum cleaner
things you set up.

562
00:35:55,747 --> 00:35:57,498
Yeah, it's like a Flowbee,
but with...

563
00:35:57,498 --> 00:36:00,001
[both laugh]

564
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:03,371
I don't know if the house
is haunted, but I hope it is.

565
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,623
- [Daniel] You hope it is?
- Yeah.

566
00:36:05,623 --> 00:36:08,126
Are you kidding me?
That would be fucking awesome.

567
00:36:08,343 --> 00:36:09,627
[Daniel] Why would you hope
that the house is haunted?

568
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:12,130
That'd be the coolest
thing ever.

569
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,882
If there was somebody trying to,
like, get through to us,

570
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,885
- that would be amazing.
- [Daniel] No, I just...

571
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:21,389
Kristi is obviously
not sleeping.

572
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:24,392
- [makes clock-like
ticking sounds]
- [Daniel] Dude.

573
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,144
She doesn't have any...

574
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:30,148
Her hormones are all kooky.
She's got... paranoid mommy...

575
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,900
...just interpreting them
in the wrong way.

576
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,654
Like, she's seeing them as,
as harmful and dangerous.

577
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:40,158
And maybe we should just
see them as something
trying to, like...

578
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:42,410
Like, I think we should
have a séance.

579
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,912
- We could go full out... What?
- [Daniel] That's a great idea.

580
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:47,548
[Daniel] Just freaky. I don't...
I don't believe in it.

581
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:51,052
Why do you think that it
necessarily has to be bad,
though?

582
00:36:51,052 --> 00:36:52,553
That's all I'm asking.

583
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:55,306
- [Daniel] How would it be good?
- Like, what if it's Mom?

584
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,357
[crickets chirring]

585
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:37,131
[Abby growling]

586
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:40,385
[babbles excitedly]

587
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,638
[rattling]

588
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:53,147
- [babbles]
- [Abby whimpers]

589
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:56,401
- [window rattles]
- [barking]

590
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:01,906
- [Daniel] Hey, guys.
- [Ali] What?

591
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:03,908
[Daniel] There's something
you need to see.

592
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:05,910
- [Kristi] What are you
talking about?
- [Ali] What's going on?

593
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,662
- You're freaking me out.
- You have to see...

594
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,164
Honey, what are
you talking about?

595
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:18,172
What are... you talking about?
What is it?

596
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,925
- I don't see anything.
- I don't understand.

597
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:25,430
- [both shriek]
- Ah-ha-ha!

598
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,182
- Yeah!
- That's not funny.

599
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,684
Yeah!

600
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:33,438

[sighs]

603
00:38:38,242 --> 00:38:39,994
[Daniel] Come on,
that was kind of funny, right?

604
00:38:40,244 --> 00:38:42,747
I just, I hate it when you
don't take me seriously.

605
00:38:42,997 --> 00:38:46,000
[Daniel] I'm sorry, honey.
I do take you seriously.
I was just trying to...

606
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,502
I'm just trying
to lighten things up.

607
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:48,753
I just want us to kind of
get back to normal.

608
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:50,037
[sighs]

609
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:51,672
Like I was thinking maybe
we could go out?

610
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:53,624
- Like... like grownups?
- Yeah, right.

611
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:57,178
[laughs] Right.
How am I gonna leave?

612
00:38:57,178 --> 00:38:58,930
[Daniel] Why, why are
you laughing? We can go.

613
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,183
- Martine's gone.
- [Daniel] No, Ali
can watch the baby.

614
00:39:03,434 --> 00:39:04,936
With the break in, and all
the weird stuff going on,

615
00:39:05,186 --> 00:39:06,687
I just don't want
to leave him alone.

616
00:39:06,687 --> 00:39:09,690
[Daniel] You know, we can't just
let this affect us that much.

617
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,808
If we do that,
the terrorists win.

618
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:14,362
- [laughs]
- [Daniel] Right?

619
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:17,398
I miss you, you know?
I miss my wife, the fun wife.

620
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:20,902
And I know I've been kind
of a tool. And I just wanna...

621
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,486
All right, so all the emergency
numbers are in this cabinet.

622
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,988
Yep.

623
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,241
[Kristi] But now his new doctor
is in there.

624
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,993

- [Kristi] Also his allergist.

625
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,244

626
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:34,747
- no peanuts on anything. Um...
- I know, no peanuts.

627
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,249
- [Hunter grunts]
- Make sure the doors

628
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:37,750
and the windows
are locked, OK?

629

Upstairs, in the back,
out front, every...

630

635

- Hello?

641
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,125
- Did I scare you?
- Yes.

642
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,712
- Lightly. Have to
warm up the board.
- Mm-hm.

643
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,714
You have to
warm up the board?

644
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:29,719
If a spirit's present,
will you give us a sign?

645

Like, literally, anything.

It goes to the "Y."
Oh, it spells "pussy."

00:41:37,754 --> 00:41:40,540
Maybe the spirit...
spirits want some pussy.

661
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,294
- Spirits?
- Yes, the spirits
might be horny

662
00:41:44,294 --> 00:41:45,795
- at the moment.
- Shh!

663
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,798
- You never know. I know I am.
- Pussy.

664
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,550
You know what?
We should keep going.

665
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:55,054
- Wait, do you feel that?
- Yes, 'cause you're moving it.

666
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:56,556
No, I'm not moving it.

667
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,308
No, this time
I'm really not moving it.

668
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:02,278
- It's...
- Wait. "H"...

Pussy-ehh. [laughs]

No, Ali, I'm really, I'm really
not moving it this time.

671
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,572
- I promise you.
- [Ali laughing]

672
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,075
No, what the fuck?
Are you doing this?

you trying to tell me something?

679
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:36,846
[Ali] Yeah, yeah,
I spelled "pussy hunt."

680
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,348
[Brad] Would you like me
to go on a pussy hunt?

681

00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:12,041
Did you look outside
to see who it was?

Yes! Yes, I couldn't.
But that's the thing, see.

would have done that.

What happened?

What do you mean?
Wait, Daniel...

757
00:49:33,813 --> 00:49:37,316
I took a nap, and I heard
somebody calling my name.

758
00:49:37,316 --> 00:49:39,318
- What?
- I felt something,

759
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:41,070
like somebody
was calling my name,

760
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,321
and I felt somebody there.

761
00:49:42,321 --> 00:49:43,572
Are you sure
you weren't dreaming?

762
00:49:43,572 --> 00:49:44,824
You weren't there.
You didn't feel it.

763
00:49:45,074 --> 00:49:47,326
- The wind blew the door closed.
- There wasn't any wind.

764
00:49:47,326 --> 00:49:50,579
All right? I don't want
to hear any more of this
haunted house crap!

765
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:53,332
OK? That's enough. You guys
are driving me crazy.

766
00:49:53,332 --> 00:49:54,834
End of story.

767
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:02,091
It was like you said,
with the pots falling.

768
00:50:02,091 --> 00:50:03,342
- You know what?
- I was taking a nap,

769
00:50:03,342 --> 00:50:06,595
- and something
was calling my name.
- Sweetheart...

770
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:10,099
I'm just gonna go
calm him down, OK?

771
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,853
Just go upstairs
and try to go to bed, OK?

772
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,987
OK, buddy.

773
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:38,961
There you go. No, no, no.
You're eating breakfast now.

774
00:50:41,213 --> 00:50:43,215
You want it
on here instead?

775
00:50:43,215 --> 00:50:44,717
OK.

776
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:49,471
Morning. [sighs]

777
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,223
[Ali] Good morning.

778
00:50:56,979 --> 00:50:58,230
Nice.

779
00:51:01,734 --> 00:51:05,020
[Kristi] Mm. Whoo.

780
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,774
Bye, little buddy.
Hot, hot, hot.

781
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,529
OK, Hunter. Got to eat.

782
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,531
Got to eat.
Come on, buddy.

783
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,464
[Brad] I don't get it.
How can you not want a back rub?

784
00:51:17,464 --> 00:51:19,716
Because I'm concentrating.

785
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:22,269
- [Brad] But you
know you love it.
- Stop.

786
00:51:22,269 --> 00:51:25,522
But this site says that if it's,
like, really persistent,

787
00:51:25,772 --> 00:51:29,976
which it is, obviously,
at this point, that it's
probably not a ghost.

788
00:51:29,976 --> 00:51:33,780
It's probably something else.
And it's possibly a demon.

789
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,316
[Brad] Well, what's the
difference between
a demon and a ghost?

790
00:51:36,566 --> 00:51:40,320
Um, because ghosts
are dead people,

791
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:41,821
so they're, like, human energy.

792
00:51:42,072 --> 00:51:45,992
And demons are not human.
They're just...

793
00:51:47,243 --> 00:51:48,745
...like, evil.

794
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:51,548
[Brad] Psyching yourself out,
looking online there.

795
00:51:51,798 --> 00:51:52,799
I'm not psyching myself out.

796
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:54,050
[Brad] Remember
when I told you that my mom

797
00:51:54,301 --> 00:51:56,553
thought she had that, like,
that flesh-eating disease?

798
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:58,338
She freaked herself out.
It's kinda like that, you know?

799
00:51:58,338 --> 00:52:02,092
- Oh, my God. Babe, here.
- [Brad] Let me see it.

800
00:52:02,092 --> 00:52:04,928
- [Ali] Like fourth
paragraph down.
- [Brad grunts]

801
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,181
[clears throat]
"It has been said that

802
00:52:08,481 --> 00:52:11,234
if a human makes a bargain
with a demon for wealth,

803
00:52:11,484 --> 00:52:13,486
power, or any other benefit,

804
00:52:13,486 --> 00:52:16,740
they must forfeit
their firstborn male.

805
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,992
If the debt is not honored,
the demon will follow the..."

806
00:52:18,992 --> 00:52:22,245
[Ali] Why are you smiling?
It's not funny.

807
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:24,998
"...will follow the defaulter
and his or her brood

808
00:52:24,998 --> 00:52:28,251
until its soul
of an infant is collected."

809
00:52:31,004 --> 00:52:32,255
So?

810
00:52:34,674 --> 00:52:36,760
OK, so this is
the freakiest thing ever.

811
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,511
It happened to me last night.

812
00:52:38,511 --> 00:52:40,263
This is the door...

813
00:52:42,265 --> 00:52:45,518
...closing by itself.
That's me walking outside.

814
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:48,772
Yeah. Dad!
Will you come in here, please?!

815
00:52:48,772 --> 00:52:52,025
OK, please stand over here
and watch this.

816
00:52:52,025 --> 00:52:54,027
[Daniel sighs] Jesus.

817
00:52:56,029 --> 00:52:58,531
[Ali] Don't look at me,
look at the screen.

818
00:53:02,285 --> 00:53:03,787
Yeah. The wind blows
the door closed.

819
00:53:03,787 --> 00:53:05,288
- [Ali] Dad.
- Thank you.

820
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:07,240
[Ali] Are you serious?

821
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,293
- It's happened
to me a million times.
- [Ali] There's no wind!

822
00:53:10,293 --> 00:53:12,045
The wind comes from the back
when the windows are open.

823
00:53:12,295 --> 00:53:14,297
[Ali] It's inside the house
and nothing else is open!

824
00:53:14,297 --> 00:53:16,499
Turn it off and stop
messing with the system.

825
00:53:16,499 --> 00:53:18,001
[Ali] Dad, there's obviously
something in the house!

826
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:19,302
[Daniel] Please, come on.

827
00:53:19,302 --> 00:53:20,470
[Ali] It's the same thing
Martine's been saying.

828
00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:22,505
[Daniel] Come get your dinner.
It's getting cold.

829
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:36,535
[crickets chirring]

830
00:54:03,311 --> 00:54:04,312
[thudding]

831
00:54:04,563 --> 00:54:07,065
[camera rattling]

832
00:54:07,065 --> 00:54:09,067
[Ali panting]

833
00:54:13,822 --> 00:54:16,491
[whispering] I think
I just heard something
coming from downstairs.

834
00:54:23,048 --> 00:54:26,051
- [thudding]
- [gasps] Fuck! Fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

835
00:54:27,552 --> 00:54:30,305
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fuck.

836
00:55:00,368 --> 00:55:02,420
[toy whirring, ringing]

837
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,673
[whistle toots]

838
00:55:04,923 --> 00:55:08,176
[whirring, ringing]

839
00:55:09,678 --> 00:55:12,681
[tooting]

840
00:55:13,682 --> 00:55:14,883
[toy stops]

841
00:55:36,204 --> 00:55:38,206
- [toy whirring]
- [Ali] Shit!

842
00:55:38,206 --> 00:55:39,958
[ringing]

843
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:42,711
[whistle toots]

844
00:55:44,496 --> 00:55:45,830
[loud slamming]

845
00:55:47,165 --> 00:55:48,667
It woke me up.

846
00:55:48,667 --> 00:55:51,920
Like, it sounded like
the door or something.

847
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,923
So I kind of checked it out
and Dad was snoring.

848
00:55:54,923 --> 00:55:59,177
And... I caught it on here.
Do you want to see?

849
00:56:03,932 --> 00:56:05,934
- Right there, you see?
- That's weird.

850
00:56:07,185 --> 00:56:08,436
It's definitely weird.

851
00:56:08,687 --> 00:56:12,190
It just freaks me out because
it just reminds me of like...

852
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:15,193
...what Martine was saying
about the house.

853
00:56:15,193 --> 00:56:17,445
What did she say
about the house?

854
00:56:17,445 --> 00:56:19,948
She said that there were
bad spirits in the house

855
00:56:20,198 --> 00:56:22,701
that she had to clear out. She
was clearing out the bad spirits

856
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:25,704
and letting in the good spirits.
But something like that...

857
00:56:26,955 --> 00:56:30,208
I don't have any other
explanation for. Do you?

858
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:32,460
I don't. I...

859
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:36,214
I remember being
scared all the time.

860
00:56:36,464 --> 00:56:38,717
What do you mean "scared
all the time," though?

861
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:41,970
- I don't know.
- No, but what do you mean?

862
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:45,724
- Like you felt,
you felt scared...
- I don't remember.

863
00:56:45,974 --> 00:56:48,476
I mean, I've been...
I'm scared.

864
00:56:48,476 --> 00:56:51,446
[Katie] So what, did she,
like, lock herself out?

865
00:56:51,696 --> 00:56:54,449
[Kristi] Well, she said the
door slammed shut on its own.

866
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:56,951
- [Katie] No.
- [Kristi] Oh, yeah.

867
00:56:58,203 --> 00:57:00,205
[Katie] That's pretty
darn creepy.

868
00:57:00,455 --> 00:57:02,957
- [exclaims]
- [Kristi] Yeah.

869
00:57:04,042 --> 00:57:05,794
[Kristi] Listen, this is
gonna sound totally crazy,

870
00:57:05,794 --> 00:57:07,796
and I know that, but...

871
00:57:07,796 --> 00:57:09,798
I've been having this
feeling lately that,

872
00:57:09,798 --> 00:57:12,300
that maybe whatever happened
to us when we were little...

873
00:57:13,051 --> 00:57:14,302
I think it's starting again.

874
00:57:14,302 --> 00:57:16,004
I don't want to talk
about this, Kristi.

875
00:57:16,254 --> 00:57:18,506
[Kristi] I don't remember
anything.

876
00:57:18,506 --> 00:57:20,258
I just remember being
scared all the time. What...

877
00:57:20,258 --> 00:57:23,762
You want to know what
I remember? I remember
you crying all the time.

878
00:57:24,012 --> 00:57:26,264
I remember you couldn't sleep,
and you got anxiety attacks.

879
00:57:26,514 --> 00:57:29,017
I remember that you
stopped talking for months.

880
00:57:29,017 --> 00:57:30,769
I remember weird people
came to our house

881
00:57:30,769 --> 00:57:33,021
and our mom was upset all the
time. That's what I remember.

882
00:57:33,021 --> 00:57:35,023
Whatever it was,
it thrived on fear.

883
00:57:35,023 --> 00:57:38,026
The more we paid attention
to it, the worse it got.

884
00:57:38,276 --> 00:57:40,278
You need to leave this alone.

885
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:42,781
You need to ignore it, or you're
gonna end up just like Mom.

886
00:57:43,031 --> 00:57:44,449
Do you understand me?

887
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:47,035
Do you understand me?

888
00:57:49,287 --> 00:57:52,040
[Kristi] Yeah, OK. I will.

889
00:58:01,132 --> 00:58:03,384
[Kristi humming softly]

890
00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:10,358
[Ali] Wanna go for a walk?
Hm? Abby.

891
00:58:10,809 --> 00:58:12,060
Come on.

892
00:58:37,135 --> 00:58:38,636
[sighs]

893
00:58:51,149 --> 00:58:53,401
[water running]

894
00:59:36,361 --> 00:59:38,112
[low thud]

895
00:59:40,365 --> 00:59:42,867
- [crashing]
- Oh, God!

896
00:59:44,118 --> 00:59:45,370
[gasps]

897
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,372

[shuddering, gasping]

899
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:58,583
God! Leave me alone!

900
01:00:04,923 --> 01:00:07,175
[tea kettle whistling]

901
01:00:18,937 --> 01:00:20,688
[whistling continuing]

902
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:33,201
[whistling subsides]

903
01:01:07,235 --> 01:01:09,704
[Ali] Yo, Kris?

904
01:01:10,738 --> 01:01:12,740
- Uh-huh.
- [Ali] Are you OK?

905
01:01:12,991 --> 01:01:16,077
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- [Ali] Did something
just happen?

906
01:01:18,212 --> 01:01:21,132
...completely fine.
Everything is fine.

907
01:01:21,132 --> 01:01:22,884
[Ali] Look at me.

908
01:01:25,386 --> 01:01:26,387
Kristi.

909
01:01:26,387 --> 01:01:28,890
Honey, everything is fine.

910
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:31,392
[Ali whispering] It's obviously
not. Look at...

911
01:01:33,144 --> 01:01:37,565
[whispering] Your Aunt Katie
said that we can't talk about
these things, OK?

912
01:01:37,565 --> 01:01:40,568
Because if you do,
it just goes... worse.

913
01:01:40,818 --> 01:01:42,820
- Listen.
- [Ali] What do you mean?

914
01:01:43,071 --> 01:01:47,075
Everything's fine. Ali, just
stop. Everything's fine.

915
01:01:47,075 --> 01:01:48,776
[Ali whispering] OK.

916
01:01:49,027 --> 01:01:52,747
No, but listen to me. That other
website said that some people...

917
01:01:52,997 --> 01:01:56,751
...like, make deals with demons
for wealth and power.

918
01:01:57,001 --> 01:02:00,505
So what if, what if
Kristi's great grandmother

919
01:02:00,505 --> 01:02:03,508
made a deal with a demon
so she could get rich?

920
01:02:05,009 --> 01:02:06,511
I went through the entire,

921
01:02:06,511 --> 01:02:08,262
I went through
the entire family line.

922
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:12,684
And Hunter is the first male
to be born on Kristi's side

923
01:02:12,934 --> 01:02:16,187
since, at least, the 1930s.

924
01:02:16,437 --> 01:02:18,389
Don't tell me that shit
isn't coincidence.

925
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:31,035
[crickets chirring]

926
01:03:05,103 --> 01:03:06,854
[whispering] Lie down.

927
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:12,860
Shh. Good girl.

928
01:03:20,618 --> 01:03:22,120

[Abby yelping]

935
01:04:33,741 --> 01:04:35,743

- [barking stops]

936
01:04:37,912 --> 01:04:39,664
[panting]

937
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,918
- Dad?
- [Daniel] Yeah.

938
01:04:43,918 --> 01:04:45,203
[Ali] Did you hear that?

939
01:04:45,203 --> 01:04:48,289
[Daniel] I heard something.
What the fuck?

940
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:51,542
Oh, God, it's Abby. Abby? Abby.

941
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:53,794
- What's the matter, baby?
- [Ali] Oh, my God.

942
01:04:53,794 --> 01:04:55,296
- [Daniel] Oh, God.
- [Ali] Is she OK?

943
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:58,766
[Daniel] Yeah. No, no, no.
Honey, grab my keys and stuff?

944
01:04:58,766 --> 01:05:00,518
- [Daniel] Grab my shoes!
- [Kristi] What's going on?

945
01:05:00,518 --> 01:05:02,270
[Daniel] I don't know. There's
something wrong with Abby.

946
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,272
- [Ali] Dad, I'm going with you!
- She's still breathing.

947
01:05:04,272 --> 01:05:06,524
- What can I do?
What should I do?
- Stay here with Hunter.

948
01:05:06,774 --> 01:05:07,775
OK.

949
01:05:07,775 --> 01:05:08,776
I'll call you
when we get there.

950
01:05:08,776 --> 01:05:10,528
- OK.
- [Ali] Oh, my God.

951
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:24,659
[keypad beeping]

952
01:05:24,909 --> 01:05:27,912
Just call me back
when you get this.

953
01:05:28,162 --> 01:05:29,664
Let me know if she's OK.

954
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:32,667
OK, love you.

955
01:05:34,919 --> 01:05:36,921
Hey, um...

956
01:05:36,921 --> 01:05:39,924
[sighs]
Is she gonna be OK?

957
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:42,927
[sighs]

958
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:46,430
I love you. Bye.

Oh, God, please!
Let go of me!

No, don't! Hunter!
Please! [shrieking]

971
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:00,731
Please! Ah!

972

[crying stops]

[low rumbling]

976
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,116
No, I don't know.
They thought it was a seizure.

977
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:28,119
No, she's never
had one before, ever.

978
01:09:28,369 --> 01:09:30,871
- And she was making this noise.
- Ali?

979
01:09:30,871 --> 01:09:33,374
Babe, I got to call you
right back, OK?

980
01:09:33,374 --> 01:09:35,126
Honey, I'm really sorry
to do this to you.

981
01:09:35,126 --> 01:09:36,627
I know this is
really bad timing.

982
01:09:36,877 --> 01:09:38,129
There's something wrong
with Kristi, OK?

983
01:09:38,379 --> 01:09:40,381
- I can't get her out of bed.
- What's wrong with her?

984
01:09:40,631 --> 01:09:42,383
...guys from Portland. I've been
putting them off for weeks.

985
01:09:42,383 --> 01:09:44,635
- I can't blow them off.
- OK, please, listen to me.

986
01:09:44,635 --> 01:09:46,137
Can I just take Hunter
to Brad's?

987
01:09:46,137 --> 01:09:47,388
No, I need you
to stay here.

988
01:09:47,388 --> 01:09:48,639
I'll come home when
you come home.

989
01:09:48,639 --> 01:09:50,891
Honey, I know this sucks.
I do, I know, OK?

990
01:09:51,142 --> 01:09:52,643
I know you're freaked
out and I'm really sorry.

991
01:09:52,893 --> 01:09:54,395
I'll be there for like
two hours, all right?

992
01:09:54,645 --> 01:09:57,648
And I have to
pick up Abby. OK?

993
01:09:57,648 --> 01:09:59,900
Please? I'm sorry, OK?

994
01:10:00,151 --> 01:10:02,653
I... call me. I'll be, like,
two hours. If anything's wrong,

995
01:10:02,653 --> 01:10:03,654
just call me and
I'll be right here,

996
01:10:03,904 --> 01:10:05,406
- OK?
- [Ali] OK.

997
01:10:05,406 --> 01:10:06,407
I just cannot
miss this today.

998
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:08,909
- Thank you. OK?
- [Ali] OK, bye.

999
01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:10,911
All right, don't worry.
Lock the door behind me, OK?

1000
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:13,164
[Ali] Yeah, I mean,
obviously.

1001
01:10:14,665 --> 01:10:18,252
No, I put him down.
He's sleeping.

1002
01:10:18,502 --> 01:10:20,754
She's not here.
She's still at the vet's.

1003
01:10:22,756 --> 01:10:24,008
No, 'cause they have
to run tests

1004
01:10:24,008 --> 01:10:26,260
'cause they don't
know what it was.

1005
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:29,013
Brad, it was...
like fucking...

1006
01:10:30,014 --> 01:10:32,266
I've never heard her
cry like that.

1007
01:10:32,266 --> 01:10:35,269
Or just tell them that you want
to come over for an hour.

1008
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,770
Please?

1009
01:10:37,771 --> 01:10:42,026
Please. No, I just don't
want to be here alone.

1010
01:10:42,276 --> 01:10:44,278
Yeah, well, basically.
She's sick or something.

1011
01:10:44,278 --> 01:10:49,033
OK. OK, bye.
Love you, too. Bye.

1012

[thumping]

1014
01:11:45,205 --> 01:11:46,957
[Ali] Oh, my God.

1015
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:52,763
OK, so, just found this
on the basement door.

1016
01:11:54,765 --> 01:11:56,767
Um... I don't really know
where it came from.

1017
01:11:56,767 --> 01:11:59,186
I think that that's blood,
but I can't really tell.

1018
01:11:59,436 --> 01:12:02,973
This comes up pretty high.
I don't think she could
get up there.

1019
01:12:03,223 --> 01:12:05,893
It kind of looks like letters,
but I don't really know
what it means.

1020
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,122
[Ali] What the fuck is that?

1021
01:12:20,374 --> 01:12:22,076
- [loud thudding]
- [Ali gasps]

[panting]

1023
01:12:33,137 --> 01:12:34,888
[Ali] Kristi?

1024
01:12:42,146 --> 01:12:43,397
[whispering] Kristi?

1025
01:12:44,898 --> 01:12:46,650
Hey, sweetpea.

1026
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,901
What's going on?

1027
01:12:49,687 --> 01:12:51,188
Come here, sweetie.

1028
01:12:51,438 --> 01:12:53,440
[grunting] Oh, yeah.

1029
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,326
[crying] Dad?

1030
01:12:55,326 --> 01:12:57,077
You have to come home
right now.

1031
01:12:57,077 --> 01:12:58,829
Dad, you have
to come home.

1032
01:12:58,829 --> 01:13:02,082
Something is really wrong
with Kristi. Please!

1033
01:13:02,082 --> 01:13:05,336
Please, come home,
please.

1034
01:13:05,336 --> 01:13:08,839
Please, just, please, come home.
Please. Please.

1035
01:13:09,089 --> 01:13:12,343
[sobbing]

1036
01:13:13,093 --> 01:13:14,628
[Ali] Kristi?

1037
01:13:14,878 --> 01:13:17,431
[Hunter wailing]

1038
01:13:17,431 --> 01:13:20,434
[Ali] Kristi? Hunter's crying.

1039
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:26,607
Don't touch him!

1040
01:13:35,733 --> 01:13:37,484
[whispers] What the fuck?

1041
01:13:38,786 --> 01:13:40,037
What the fuck?

1042
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:44,041
- Are you OK?
- [sobbing] No!

1043
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:47,544
- Oh, my. Where is she?
- [sobbing] She's upstairs.

1044
01:13:47,544 --> 01:13:49,296
She's in Hunter's room.
You can't go up there!

1045
01:13:49,296 --> 01:13:51,048
- I have to see if she's OK.
- You can't go up there!

1046
01:13:51,298 --> 01:13:52,299
You have to look
at the tape!

1047
01:13:52,549 --> 01:13:53,801
- I have to check on Hunter.
- She got attacked!

1048
01:13:54,051 --> 01:13:55,552
You have to watch
the tape! Please!

1049
01:13:55,803 --> 01:13:58,055
Please, please,
just listen to me!

1050
01:14:00,257 --> 01:14:02,309
[Ali] Dad, we have to go
right now.

1051
01:14:03,811 --> 01:14:08,065
Fuck. Dad? Dad, look at me.
Do you believe me now?

1052
01:14:08,065 --> 01:14:11,351
Come on! We can't stay here!
Please!

1053
01:14:12,102 --> 01:14:13,854
- [sighs]
- Dad!

1054
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:27,367
[Ali] What are you doing?

1055
01:14:27,618 --> 01:14:30,204
She tried to warn me,
and I wouldn't listen.

1056
01:14:30,204 --> 01:14:31,705
[Ali sobs] Wait,
who are you talking about?

1057
01:14:31,955 --> 01:14:35,375
- [sighs]
- Dad, who are you
talking about?

1058
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:38,128
- [Martine speaks Spanish]
- What?

1059
01:14:41,381 --> 01:14:42,599
Olive oil?

1060
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:48,272
[speaking Spanish]

1061
01:14:50,974 --> 01:14:52,643
- What?
- [Martine continues in Spanish]

1062
01:14:52,893 --> 01:14:55,529
- What am I gonna do with this?
- [speaking Spanish]

1063
01:14:55,529 --> 01:14:58,115
- This is gonna knock her out?
-S?.

1064
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:02,453
I told you to stay here.

1065
01:15:02,453 --> 01:15:04,238
OK, you're kind of freaking
me out right now, OK?

1066
01:15:04,455 --> 01:15:07,241
Can you please talk to me?

1067
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:09,743
[Ali sobs] Dad, look at her leg.
Look at the bite.

1068
01:15:12,746 --> 01:15:14,715
[whispering] What the fuck?!

1069
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:20,304
[Daniel] No, no. No way, no way.

1070
01:15:20,304 --> 01:15:22,339
We can't do this to her.
It's her family.

1071
01:15:22,339 --> 01:15:23,841
- Please, please...
- What am I supposed to do?!

1072
01:15:24,091 --> 01:15:26,343
It's Kristi's fucking sister!
We can't do that to her!

1073
01:15:26,593 --> 01:15:28,846
We can't do this.
We cannot do this to her.

1074
01:15:29,096 --> 01:15:31,348
Look, there is no other way.

1075
01:15:31,348 --> 01:15:33,350
Yes, there is. We can transfer
it to somebody else.

1076
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,352
- No, we can't. No, we can't.
- That's what we have to do.

1077
01:15:35,352 --> 01:15:37,354
OK? Martine said it had
to be a blood relative.

1078
01:15:37,354 --> 01:15:39,106
OK? That's my wife
and my son!

1079
01:15:39,106 --> 01:15:42,109
- That is your
little baby brother!
- Do we tell her?

1080
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:44,111
- Do we tell her what happened?
- No, we never tell anyone.

1081
01:15:44,361 --> 01:15:45,612
She's not even gonna
remember, OK?

1082
01:15:45,863 --> 01:15:47,614
Martine said she's not
gonna remember, OK?

1083
01:15:47,865 --> 01:15:49,366
And we're not gonna
talk about it, ever!

1084
01:15:49,616 --> 01:15:52,119
And I don't care if you
agree with me or not, OK?

1085
01:15:52,119 --> 01:15:53,871
It's my decision!
I'm doing it!

1086
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:56,123
[Ali whispering] What...?

All right. Are you ready?
You're gonna like this.

[Kristi] I am ready,
I'm thrilled. I'm excited.

Is it a tie? Is it...?
Oh! Shocking!

1155
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:56,923
So how are things, uh... here?

Good. I must be losing
my mind. I just... [chuckles]

1159
01:21:05,732 --> 01:21:07,734
I feel like there's stuff
going on at our house,

1160
01:21:07,734 --> 01:21:09,486
to the point where I actually
told Micah about it,

1161
01:21:09,736 --> 01:21:11,488
and I'm sure he thinks
I'm crazy.

1162
01:21:11,738 --> 01:21:13,523
[Kristi] You should
take your own advice.

1163
01:21:13,523 --> 01:21:16,526
We shouldn't talk about this
stuff. It just drives us nuts.

1164
01:21:16,526 --> 01:21:19,246
- You're right.
- [Kristi] Sis?

[Katie] What is that?

1169
01:21:30,507 --> 01:21:32,008
[Micah] Hello, baby.

1170
01:21:32,008 --> 01:21:33,760
[Katie] Hi.

1171
01:21:34,761 --> 01:21:36,513
Is that what I think it is?

1172
01:21:36,763 --> 01:21:38,215
[Micah] Yeah, it's... I don't
know what you think it is,

1173
01:21:38,215 --> 01:21:39,933
but whatever it is,
it's pretty sweet.

1174
01:21:39,933 --> 01:21:41,768
I think it's a giant-ass camera.

1175
01:21:41,935 --> 01:21:44,387
What happened to, like,
the little handheld?

Easy to move around, versatile.

Are you gonna park the car
or are you gonna stand there,
looking at me?

1178
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:52,646
This is, uh...
big and impressive,

1179
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:55,649
and it has a really
bright light on it.

1180
01:21:55,899 --> 01:21:57,901
- [Micah] Kiss the camera,
will you?
- I'm not kissing the camera.

1181
01:21:58,151 --> 01:21:59,903
- [Micah] Come on.
- How much did this cost you?

1182
01:22:00,153 --> 01:22:01,655
- [Micah] What?
- How much did...

1183
01:22:01,655 --> 01:22:03,907
I'll kiss you, but I'm
not gonna kiss the camera.
