1
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:08,066
(Woman laughs)

2
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:09,466
(Man)
No, l'm not a sausage.

3
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:12,870
Non. Non, c'est trois not do it.

4
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,704
(French accent)
Ah, bravo. Bravo.

5
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:17,505
Ah, bravo. Voila.

6
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:19,546
You are bilingue now.

7
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:22,411
You're the sausage,
mate, not me.

8
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:25,778
(Woman)
Non, non, do it.

9
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:27,821
J'adore quand tu parle francais.

10
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:30,356
You know, l-- l don't really care
what you say.

11
00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:32,517
lt sounds good. Heh heh.

12
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:35,585
l spoke to your mom
this morning.

13
00:02:35,663 --> 00:02:37,255
- You spoke to my mom?
- Uh-huh.

14
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:39,356
She's devious, my mother.

15
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:41,367
She tried to speak French to me.

16
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:43,198
What she was trying--
She was--

17
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,431
- She was trying to nag in French.
- Yeah.

18
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:48,270
- She wants to cover all bases.
- Yeah.

19
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:51,842
(Man)
Why do you think she likes you so much?

20
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:54,472
Because l'm the best.
Look what you had before me.

21
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:56,482
Well, she didn't like any
of my other girlfriends.

22
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,074
No. Look at me.

23
00:02:58,152 --> 00:02:59,449
Look at you. (chuckles)

24
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,249
Of course she loves me.

25
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:03,517
l cook well. l'm an artist.

26
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:06,389
l'm French and talented,

27
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,451
and l live with you.

28
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:11,123
She told me that you had a nose job,

29
00:03:11,198 --> 00:03:14,326
- and l thought that was sort of gay.
- l had a what?

30
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:16,096
What did l have?

31
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,603
A nose job.

32
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:19,434
- Nose job? l didn't get a nose job.
- l was--

33
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:22,100
- Yes.
- She said nice job. She said l got a nice job.

34
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:25,304
Yeah, nice job.
Honey, l want to see--

35
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:36,444
Thank you.

36
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:38,007
Thanks, mate.

37
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,315
Ready to rock, baby?

38
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,084
- That's it?
- That's it.

39
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,626
So they let us take the boat out
without knowing anything?

40
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:48,491
Just leave
the technical stuff to me, babe.

41
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:51,395
- Okay, boss. You have a tag here.
- Come on, let's get on.

42
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:02,666
Okay?

43
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:05,234
Why you didn't get a bigger boat?

44
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:06,711
What's wrong with this boat?

45
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,511
lt's a beautiful
handcrafted timber boat.

46
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:12,518
Old-fashioned, like me.

47
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:19,818
Easy.

48
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:49,381
l wish for fish

49
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,544
for a fine fish dish.

50
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:56,516
l thought you had a busy week--

51
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,854
We dropped the case.

52
00:06:58,926 --> 00:07:00,985
You've dropped
the Chapman case?

53
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:03,552
Well, we can't win.
Their word against hers, so...

54
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,824
Yeah, we dropped the case.

55
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:06,422
But they raped her.

56
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,797
Well, they say they didn't do it.

57
00:07:07,868 --> 00:07:09,768
That's the problem with crime:
the crooks always deny it.

58
00:07:09,837 --> 00:07:11,702
- lt's a real bitch.
- And you're okay with this?

59
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:14,240
lf it were up to me,
l'd have the shit kicked out of them,

60
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,868
then l'd have them locked up,
but it's not up to me.

61
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:19,242
- So, you get raped--
- Oh, come on, sweetheart. Can't we just--

62
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,780
So, you get raped,
and you just forget it

63
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:23,078
because the courts are
all stacked against you?

64
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,710
Sorry, Mrs. Chapman.
Tough turkey, huh?

65
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:27,515
Tough titty, babe.

66
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:29,715
Titty.

67
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,054
l don't-- l don't understand.

68
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,559
l mean, justice. Yeah.

69
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:35,856
Come on, baby.

70
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:38,693
Let's have a little drink, a little topper.

71
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:40,733
Whoa, Baby! That's you!
Come on! Come on! Reel it in!

72
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:42,029
No, you do it!

73
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:44,093
No, honey, it's your pole,
it's your fish.

74
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,002
Just...round, round.
That bit there.

75
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:47,233
lt won't go. Please do it.

76
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:48,274
Give it here.

77
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,742
l got it. Ooh, that's a monster.

78
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:53,006
- lt's a big one. Whoa!
- Wha--

79
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,173
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Whoo!

80
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:56,580
No, don't kill it!

81
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,016
No, do not! Don't kill it!

82
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,052
lt's a flathead.

83
00:08:06,126 --> 00:08:08,754
That's disgusting.

84
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,923
Yeah, well, that's fishing, baby.

85
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,682
Weather's changed.

86
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,886
Pushing us north.

87
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:42,155
(yawning)

88
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,924
What's happened
to our nice, sunny day, babe?

89
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:47,230
(thunder rumbling in distance)

90
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,138
Let's go back. lt's getting cold.

91
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:56,108
Looks like it'll pass over.

92
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:57,643
Let's swing around
those heads,

93
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,544
come on back,
just past those mangroves.

94
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:03,174
What do you reckon?

95
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,877
Yeah, let's do it.

96
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:06,351
Come on, weigh anchor.

97
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:20,927
There we go.

98
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:29,368
Voila.

99
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,877
Voila.

100
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,782
(engine starts)

101
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:44,118
Voila.

102
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:29,987
(thunderclap)

103
00:13:09,896 --> 00:13:12,524
We are lost, aren't we?

104
00:13:14,334 --> 00:13:16,495
Well, it's too shallow
for the outboard.

105
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,299
l guess the tide goes out quickly around here.

106
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:21,135
What does that mean?

107
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:23,233
That means...

108
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,141
that's for you...

109
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,042
and this is for me.

110
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:30,139
Okay, where are we going now?

111
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:33,152
Well, we know the tide
runs back into the bay,

112
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,279
so l guess we just go with it.

113
00:13:39,492 --> 00:13:41,687
(thunderclap)

114
00:13:50,904 --> 00:13:52,804
(Rob panting)

115
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,943
(groans)

116
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:05,174
lt's getting shallower, Rob.

117
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,983
Where are we?

118
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:10,955
We're in a drain.

119
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,685
A what?

120
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,750
Agricultural drain.

121
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:19,060
Probably caught
in a non-eccentric drainage paddock.

122
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:23,229
You bring me boating in a drain?

123
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:25,965
l'm full of surprises.

124
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,633
l think we've come
about a mile inland,

125
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:32,041
so gotta be some farms
around here somewhere.

126
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:41,086
What are you doing now?

127
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:44,214
l'm just gonna climb up,
have a look.

128
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,691
Just for a...look.

129
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:02,841
(thunderclap)

130
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,843
We've been going in circles.

131
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:17,515
All right, l fucked up. l'm sorry.

132
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,455
l can't believe this.

133
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:21,221
We can't float, we can't walk,

134
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:23,524
and-- and l'm tired now.

135
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:25,461
Come on, babe.
There's nothing we can do about it.

136
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:27,022
Let's just pretend we're castaways.

137
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,797
That's what we are,
castaways, damn you.

138
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,462
There's a building
or something up ahead.

139
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:33,665
l'm gonna go scout around.

140
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,264
You coming,
or you gonna wait here?

141
00:15:35,342 --> 00:15:38,539
No, l'd like to wait here, Rob,
with the crabs and mosquitoes.

142
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,073
There's still
no reception, of course.

143
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:44,844
Jesus. How many times
do l gotta apologize?

144
00:15:44,918 --> 00:15:47,751
(engine running, voices)

145
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:51,417
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

146
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,052
See?

147
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:57,426
Stop it. Stay here. Look around.

148
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,190
What are they doing?

149
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:09,400
l don't like it. Let's go.

150
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:12,502
Let's go.

151
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:14,479
(screaming)

152
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:04,529
Look up there.

153
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,269
Wait here.

154
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,218
There's a farmhouse
or something up there.

155
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:30,221
lt'll be fine.

156
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,382
- A farm?
- Yeah. Yeah.

157
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,655
We'll get a taxi back to the car,
drinking margaritas by midday.

158
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:36,058
Come on.

159
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,942
(heavy rain)

160
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,647
(knocking)

161
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:40,715
Hello.

162
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:45,658
There's nobody here.

163
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:47,131
Wait here. l'll check the back.

164
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,634
Okay. Be careful.

165
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,762
Hey.

166
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,095
lt's all right. lt's all right.

167
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,691
ls anybody here?

168
00:19:55,768 --> 00:19:57,531
lt's okay. There's no one here.

169
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:58,662
Are you sure we should be

170
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:00,330
just breaking into
somebody's house?

171
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:02,897
We're not breaking in.
There's no one there.

172
00:20:02,976 --> 00:20:05,206
Come on.

173
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:25,090
Oh, my God.

174
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,125
l think pigs live here.

175
00:20:30,203 --> 00:20:32,398
Any port in a storm.

176
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:36,074
Oh, that's disgusting.

177
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,708
l feel like Goldilocks.

178
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:43,881
Here's your three bears.

179
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:55,250
l'm gonna take a look around,
see if l can find a phone.

180
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,490
Be careful.

181
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,527
(clattering)

182
00:21:32,598 --> 00:21:34,725
(thunderclap)

183
00:21:58,825 --> 00:22:00,190
(switch clicks)

184
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:01,556
(flies buzzing)

185
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:02,753
(sigh)

186
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:29,745
Ah, fuck.

187
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,300
Rob!

188
00:23:24,811 --> 00:23:27,041
Rob!

189
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:42,089
Somebody's outside.

190
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:44,925
Come on, we gotta
get out of here. Come on.

191
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:52,664
(Man)
Get out of my fucking house!

192
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:58,008
Don't make me come in there
and drag you fuckers out!

193
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:05,741
l'm gonna blow your
fucking brains out!

194
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:10,311
Get out of the fucking house!

195
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:12,687
Listen, mate, my name's Rob Brewer.
We didn't--

196
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:14,453
l'm not your mate, Robert.

197
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:16,085
Get the fuck out of my house!

198
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,497
Look, we were just
out boating, and--

199
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:23,194
Listen, we don't--

200
00:24:26,472 --> 00:24:29,805
Oh, hey. Hey.

201
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:31,275
Come on, we--

202
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,177
Now, what you fucking
doing in there, slick?

203
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:38,145
We were just out, uh, boating,

204
00:24:38,217 --> 00:24:40,742
and, uh, you know, we, uh,

205
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,412
we were so tired, we got lost,

206
00:24:42,488 --> 00:24:44,752
and we saw your light.

207
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:46,257
We just thought--

208
00:24:46,325 --> 00:24:49,260
Thought you'd make
yourself at home, eh?

209
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:51,091
No, no, no, no, no.

210
00:24:51,163 --> 00:24:53,097
The back door was open.
We, uh--

211
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:56,623
Oh, the back door was...
the back door was open.

212
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:59,865
We'd just like to use
your phone, please.

213
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:01,736
That's all, all right?

214
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:04,739
You don't have a phone?

215
00:25:07,813 --> 00:25:09,781
lf we could just get
to the nearest, um--

216
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:13,012
The nearest anything's
26 mile away, slick.

217
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:16,680
Well, if you fellas could take us there,

218
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:19,088
l'd be happy to fix you up
for any expenses.

219
00:25:19,158 --> 00:25:21,718
Oh, that is rich.

220
00:25:21,794 --> 00:25:25,594
You're gonna fix us up
with what, slick?

221
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:28,862
Well, if you could just...

222
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:30,493
point us to the nearest
main road,

223
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,504
we'll be on our way
and there won't be any trouble.

224
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,630
(snickering)

225
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,469
You really are lost, aren't ya?

226
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:36,633
Lost, huh? Fucking!

227
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,609
(chuckles)

228
00:25:38,678 --> 00:25:41,647
There's no main roads
around here, slick.

229
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:44,342
You're on an island.

230
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:49,418
French lsland?
We're on French lsland.

231
00:25:49,488 --> 00:25:50,955
When is the ferry--

232
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:52,388
Shh-shh-shh.

233
00:25:54,026 --> 00:25:57,086
You go and get Poppy out of the truck.
You put him to bed.

234
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:59,028
lf he sees these two,
he's gonna fucking freak.

235
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:00,793
Fuck!

236
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,971
Sorry about my brother there.

237
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:19,677
But he gets a bit excited.

238
00:26:22,021 --> 00:26:23,352
Please.

239
00:26:35,434 --> 00:26:37,493
After all, you can't be too careful, eh?

240
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,596
Lot of creeps come around,
bustin' into houses and shit.

241
00:26:40,673 --> 00:26:42,573
Please, if you could just take us--

242
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,109
What's that?

243
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:45,541
l said if you could just take us to--

244
00:26:45,611 --> 00:26:48,409
Oh, ha ha ha!

245
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,472
You got yourself
a frog chick, eh?

246
00:26:51,817 --> 00:26:54,251
You're a real Frenchie
on French lsland, eh?

247
00:26:55,554 --> 00:26:59,456
Hey, doll, see this?

248
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:02,426
l found him on the side of the road.

249
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:05,124
You like kangaroos, darling?

250
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:06,129
Yes.

251
00:27:06,198 --> 00:27:07,597
Yes?

252
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,760
Want to pet him?

253
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:11,928
Go on, he won't bite.

254
00:27:14,273 --> 00:27:15,501
Aah!

255
00:27:15,574 --> 00:27:16,973
(laughing)

256
00:27:17,043 --> 00:27:20,137
l might, though.

257
00:27:22,715 --> 00:27:24,774
You out boating, you say?

258
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:29,147
Yeah.

259
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:32,190
Her car's back at the boat harbor.

260
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:39,721
Please, if you could just take us
to the nearest phone.

261
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,962
The switchboard in Tankerton
closes at 7:30, darling.

262
00:27:43,035 --> 00:27:45,060
The switchboard closes?

263
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:49,799
What, are you fucking deaf?

264
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:52,105
Closes at 7:30!

265
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:56,438
No, this isn't the city out here, slick.

266
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:58,574
You're in the boonies now.

267
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:01,711
We go for weeks without
seeing shit out here.

268
00:28:18,104 --> 00:28:20,038
That there's Poppy.

269
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,231
Yeah, he's kind of
a tired little camper.

270
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,401
He's had a very big day.

271
00:28:24,477 --> 00:28:27,378
(chuckling)

272
00:28:27,446 --> 00:28:28,913
This place Tankerton,

273
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:31,176
if you could just take us to a hotel.

274
00:28:34,386 --> 00:28:36,718
What hotel's that, darlin'?

275
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:40,725
Yeah, would you like the Tankerton Regency
or the lsland Hilton?

276
00:28:44,697 --> 00:28:47,359
So you had a bit of a look
around the property before we got here?

277
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:49,424
There's, um--

278
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:51,094
There's gotta be some way
we can contact someone--

279
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,536
Come on, slick.

280
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,166
lt's coming down
cats and dogs out there.

281
00:28:56,242 --> 00:28:57,834
Plenty of room here.

282
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,310
Now, tomorrow,
l'll drive you in to Tankerton.

283
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:01,971
How's that?

284
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:06,844
You probably want to get out of them
clammy wet suits, or what?

285
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:10,851
Yeah, look like you could use

286
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:13,084
a hot shower
and some dry clothes.

287
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:15,127
The both of youse.

288
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:17,718
Yes, please.

289
00:29:19,365 --> 00:29:21,094
All right, You get started,

290
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:22,998
l'll boil you up some water
for your shower.

291
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:26,265
We don't want to put
you to any trouble.

292
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:28,169
Oh, it's no trouble, darling.

293
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,538
Not yet, anyway.

294
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:32,577
You go on outside.

295
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,135
Shower's on the back porch there.

296
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:35,578
Towels are inside the door.

297
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:39,874
Here you go.

298
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:42,318
Oh, thank you.

299
00:29:46,258 --> 00:29:47,885
Hey, slick.

300
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:50,527
What sort of car?

301
00:29:50,596 --> 00:29:51,528
Car?

302
00:29:51,597 --> 00:29:53,929
This car you got, what sort is it?

303
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:56,058
lt's a Volvo 870.

304
00:30:02,241 --> 00:30:04,334
Go on, Volvo.

305
00:30:08,881 --> 00:30:11,611
Fucking Volvo!

306
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,324
We gotta get out of here.

307
00:30:21,393 --> 00:30:22,655
You're telling me?

308
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:24,161
We're talking cavemen here.

309
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,322
These guys are sick.

310
00:30:25,397 --> 00:30:27,422
There's a shed full
of marijuana out the back.

311
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,601
(Rob)
They're growing the stuff. A lot of it.

312
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:32,762
lt's none of our business.

313
00:30:32,838 --> 00:30:34,829
They're not gonna let us
walk away from here.

314
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:38,104
There's enough pot there
to put these guys away for 10 years.

315
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:41,211
Honey, they're not gonna let us go.

316
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,373
We gotta get the cops back here.

317
00:30:43,449 --> 00:30:45,576
- l knew we shouldn't have--
- Listen.

318
00:30:45,651 --> 00:30:47,482
They don't know that we know.

319
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:49,453
Okay? Just play it cool, babe.

320
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:50,613
They're the ones we saw before.

321
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:52,589
What were they doing to that boy?

322
00:30:52,658 --> 00:30:55,252
l don't know. l don't know.

323
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:57,795
My best guess would be
just to do what they say.

324
00:30:57,863 --> 00:30:59,558
The first chance we get,
we'll take off, okay?

325
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:00,564
Okay.

326
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:02,123
Okay?

327
00:31:02,201 --> 00:31:03,327
lt's going to be okay.

328
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:04,334
lt's okay, baby.

329
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:06,428
- Yeah.

330
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:22,411
Where are our clothes?

331
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:26,722
They're gone.

332
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:28,589
And our wet suits?

333
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:30,891
They're gone.

334
00:31:30,963 --> 00:31:33,932
They're fucking with us. Put this on.

335
00:31:37,736 --> 00:31:38,930
Put it on.

336
00:31:39,004 --> 00:31:40,801
This is bad.

337
00:31:40,873 --> 00:31:42,238
You wait here.

338
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:43,639
Where are you going?

339
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:45,438
- Just wait.
- No, please.

340
00:31:45,511 --> 00:31:46,944
Bring me along, please.

341
00:31:47,012 --> 00:31:48,809
You just wait. l'll fix it.

342
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:50,007
- No.
- Wait.

343
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:52,141
You're all right.

344
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:06,459
You wake Poppy, you know
what's gonna fucking happen!

345
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:13,070
We can't seem to find
the pants you guys gave us.

346
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:16,666
Well, that's a fucking mystery.

347
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:21,141
Come on. You gonna give us
some pants or what?

348
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:24,478
Not up to your Volvo
standards, huh, boss?

349
00:32:26,151 --> 00:32:29,587
Listen, my wife's scared.
We're both tired.

350
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,919
Give us a break, will ya?

351
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,255
Give you a break?

352
00:32:34,326 --> 00:32:38,387
You fucking yuppie tort rat.

353
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:45,902
You fuck up out
in the water, hmm?

354
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:49,268
You break into our house.

355
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,777
And then you help yourself
to our private fucking property,

356
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:59,409
and then you bitch and moan
because we ain't got a phone.

357
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:02,886
You are fucking
unbelievable, sunshine.

358
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,219
So what do you want? Hmm?

359
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:07,918
Do you want my trousers?

360
00:33:09,962 --> 00:33:13,022
No, no, no, no. 'Cause...

361
00:33:13,098 --> 00:33:16,067
l'm not the one who fucked up.

362
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:18,365
You fucked up.

363
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:21,270
You are starting
to give me the shits.

364
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,571
l think you better
wake the old guy up.

365
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:26,167
l want to speak to him.

366
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:29,043
Oh, no, no, no. That wouldn't be
a good idea at all.

367
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,911
Then can we have
our wet suits back?

368
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:35,647
What, those heavy things?

369
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:37,586
What, do you wanna catch
a cold and give it to us?

370
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:39,749
(laughs)

371
00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:42,919
No, you see, this is
a working farm, slick.

372
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:45,259
lt's hard enough
to scratch out a living

373
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,560
without some city
butt-stain coming in here

374
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:50,193
and treating this place
like his own private shit can.

375
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:53,966
You are an inconsiderate bastard.

376
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:57,503
Considering how you
tracked dirt and shit

377
00:33:57,576 --> 00:33:59,237
all the way through
this fucking house.

378
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:01,972
You've left the tap running outside.

379
00:34:02,047 --> 00:34:03,810
You've wasted half a tank of water.

380
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:09,143
And you left the lights
on in the back shed.

381
00:34:13,992 --> 00:34:16,688
Now, what's your
old lady like as a cook?

382
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:28,835
They know about the drugs.

383
00:34:28,907 --> 00:34:31,375
l think we should do
what they say, baby.

384
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:41,476
(dog grunting)

385
00:34:50,863 --> 00:34:54,458
Jimmy, get her to say somethin'
in froggy talk. Go on.

386
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:56,728
Darling.

387
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,628
Darling?

388
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:03,370
Say something in frog talk.

389
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:05,501
Give me some
of that fucking...

390
00:35:05,577 --> 00:35:08,774
parléz-vous, oui-oui lingo.

391
00:35:08,847 --> 00:35:11,680
(laughs)
Oui-oui lingo.

392
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,308
Fucking...

393
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,509
(Jimmy)
Go on.

394
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,823
(speaking French)

395
00:35:39,878 --> 00:35:42,346
That is fucking sexy.

396
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:45,110
(laughs)
What'd you say, pussycat?

397
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,451
- lt's a--
- lt's a Gallic folk song.

398
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,650
Mothers sing it to their children.

399
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:04,063
My cup's empty, captain.

400
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,239
(brothers laugh)

401
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:14,904
Yeah, a thin dick!

402
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:20,684
Hey, Volvo,

403
00:36:20,752 --> 00:36:24,916
l want you to show us
your old lady's ass.

404
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,924
Let's see if that's
as good as an Aussie ass.

405
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:28,550
This has gone far enough.

406
00:36:28,627 --> 00:36:29,889
We just wanna see your old lady's booty.

407
00:36:29,962 --> 00:36:32,430
We did you a favor,
now you do us a fucking favor.

408
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:34,226
- Quid pro fucking quo!
- Quo! Quo!

409
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:36,096
Forget it.

410
00:36:40,973 --> 00:36:43,601
What, now you're telling me
what l can and can't do

411
00:36:43,675 --> 00:36:45,700
in my own fucking house, Volvo?

412
00:36:48,614 --> 00:36:51,583
lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay.

413
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:54,847
- No, no, no. No. No.
- (wolf whistle)

414
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,581
lt doesn't matter, Rob. Please.

415
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:58,646
(wolf whistle)

416
00:37:00,158 --> 00:37:02,786
(Man moaning)

417
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:05,193
(wolf whistle)

418
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,561
That's enough.

419
00:37:06,632 --> 00:37:09,601
Who the fuck is talking
to you, Volvo, eh?

420
00:37:11,169 --> 00:37:15,503
Now, my drink
is still empty, captain.

421
00:37:24,383 --> 00:37:25,407
What the fuck's this for?

422
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:27,975
You burned the fucking eggs!

423
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:30,817
What are we supposed
to do with this shit, eh?

424
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:33,653
What is this? This your parléz-vous
fucking whore cuisine, is it?

425
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:36,353
What, you serve that to Volvo, eh?

426
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:37,690
Well, that's fucking great.

427
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:40,731
See those?

428
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,824
That's the last of the eggs.

429
00:37:42,901 --> 00:37:44,994
Now what the fuck
are we gonna do for dinner?

430
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:48,096
Eh? What are we
gonna do for dinner?

431
00:37:48,173 --> 00:37:52,940
'Cause Brett and me,
we're hungry, aren't we, Brett?

432
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:55,639
l suppose maybe
you could help me, huh?

433
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:58,148
Uh-huh.

434
00:37:58,216 --> 00:37:59,843
'Cause Brett and me, we're hungry,

435
00:37:59,918 --> 00:38:02,785
and we wanna know what the fuck
you're gonna do about it!

436
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:16,627
Come on, it's just
a fucking animal. Kill it.

437
00:38:16,702 --> 00:38:18,966
l can't.

438
00:38:19,037 --> 00:38:20,504
lt's just a fucking wallaby.

439
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:23,132
Thousands of these little fuckers
die on the roads every night.

440
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,140
Come on, cut it!

441
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:26,040
- l'll cut it, Jim.
- Ah, ah.

442
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:29,938
What are you, one of these bleeding heart
motherfuckers?

443
00:38:30,015 --> 00:38:30,947
Eh?

444
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:33,348
Save all the fuzzy fucking creatures.

445
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:36,854
l just don't kill things.

446
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:39,686
Oh, oh.

447
00:38:39,758 --> 00:38:42,784
Well-- Well, l guess we could
just stain the little fucker

448
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:44,954
while he's still alive, eh, Brett?

449
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,760
l mean, how inhumane
is that gonna be, eh?

450
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:49,425
Fucking kill the fucker!

451
00:38:49,501 --> 00:38:51,128
Leave her alone, will you?

452
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:54,934
God, you've got some balls,
eh, Volvo?

453
00:38:55,006 --> 00:38:57,338
No! Just leave her alone.

454
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:59,502
You got some
fucking balls, huh?

455
00:38:59,578 --> 00:39:01,876
Leave her alone, please!

456
00:39:01,947 --> 00:39:05,178
Let's see what your fucking yuppie balls
look like, eh?

457
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,651
Maybe we can fry 'em up
with Scooby there.

458
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,018
Wouldn't be the first time we taste
the old long big, eh, Brett?

459
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:14,058
- Please.
- Poppy says we shouldn't talk about that.

460
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:17,625
Maybe we take your
fucking kidneys, eh?

461
00:39:17,696 --> 00:39:18,924
Just cut 'em right out

462
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:21,488
and we'll feed the scraps
to Honky, eh?

463
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:23,261
Now you hold real still, slick,

464
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:26,827
'cause this is gonna hurt
just a little fucking bit.

465
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:29,339
(whimpering)

466
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,069
(shouts)

467
00:39:31,143 --> 00:39:33,771
Ooh-wee, doggie!

468
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:41,785
Looks like you're the one

469
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:44,617
with the balls, darling.

470
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:49,555
(sobs)
Shh.

471
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:51,425
lt's all right.

472
00:39:51,496 --> 00:39:53,794
Please.

473
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:06,469
You--

474
00:40:06,545 --> 00:40:09,708
You ought to be
a fucking chef, oui-oui.

475
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:12,614
You got a job in the city?

476
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:15,881
What do you do for crust, eh?

477
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:17,546

478
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:19,522
An artist.

479
00:40:21,393 --> 00:40:22,587
What do you make?

480
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:24,128
A whole shit pile of money, or what?

And what about you, no-balls?

485
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,910
What do you do when

486
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:46,678
in a little fucking boat?

487
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:49,481
(Brett scoffs)

488
00:40:49,554 --> 00:40:51,181
l'm a barrister.

489
00:40:53,024 --> 00:40:54,355
What?

490
00:40:54,426 --> 00:40:55,859
A barrister.

491
00:40:56,928 --> 00:40:58,327
''Beeraster?''

492
00:40:58,396 --> 00:40:59,658
(snorts)

493
00:40:59,731 --> 00:41:00,925
You fucking beeraster.

494
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:03,365
Move to strike
or order a fucking beer!

495
00:41:03,435 --> 00:41:07,462
- (screaming)
- lt's Poppy.

496
00:41:11,543 --> 00:41:12,942
Mmm...

497
00:41:33,865 --> 00:41:36,834
Do you know what we do
for a dollar, darling?

498
00:41:39,271 --> 00:41:41,000
No.

499
00:41:44,843 --> 00:41:47,175
Are you sure?

500
00:41:47,245 --> 00:41:50,373
l have no idea what you do.

501
00:41:53,985 --> 00:41:56,681
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

502
00:41:58,924 --> 00:42:01,950
Listen, my husband and l are tired.

503
00:42:02,027 --> 00:42:03,688
lf there's a place where we can--

504
00:42:03,762 --> 00:42:07,289
Lie down your weary heads, huh?
Go, na-nas?

505
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:10,266
(French accent)
But, of course, oui-oui.

506
00:42:10,335 --> 00:42:12,997
You must be exhausted!
Huh-huh!

507
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,704
lt's been a big day for you, hasn't it?

508
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:23,247
Driving that heavy fucking Volvo

509
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:25,078
all the way out
from the city going boating.

510
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,947
Fishing.

511
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:29,111
(spits)
Whatever the fuck you were doing.

512
00:42:29,187 --> 00:42:30,950
(snorts)
Well...

513
00:42:31,022 --> 00:42:32,717
(sniffs)

514
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:36,659
l am sorry that we didn't
set up the suite for you.

515
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:39,128
But you...

516
00:42:39,197 --> 00:42:41,563
can have the whole barn to yourselves.

517
00:42:41,633 --> 00:42:43,931
How's that?

518
00:42:44,002 --> 00:42:46,493
The barn will be fine, thank you.

519
00:42:46,571 --> 00:42:51,235
(imitating)
The barn will be fine, love.

520
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:53,539
Jolly good, old cock.

521
00:43:10,996 --> 00:43:12,623
Voila.

522
00:43:20,271 --> 00:43:22,262
Get Honky to guard that fucking door.

523
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,673
(whistles)
Honky!

524
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,811
Honky!

525
00:43:32,884 --> 00:43:36,945
(whistles)

526
00:43:37,022 --> 00:43:39,047
Stupid mutt.

527
00:44:00,045 --> 00:44:01,512
We're getting out of here.

528
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:03,240
You think they'll just let us run?

529
00:44:03,314 --> 00:44:04,303
What about the dog?

530
00:44:04,382 --> 00:44:05,781
We don't have a choice.

531
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,080
We are not gonna stick around
to see what happens next.

532
00:44:08,153 --> 00:44:10,621
Okay.
Come on.

533
00:44:15,894 --> 00:44:17,293
(Rob)
Come on.

534
00:44:27,138 --> 00:44:28,799
This is too easy.

535
00:44:28,873 --> 00:44:30,238
Go! Move!

536
00:44:30,308 --> 00:44:31,775
- ls this the way back?
- Come on, go!

537
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:34,743

538
00:44:34,813 --> 00:44:37,077
- ls this the track?
- Hurry up!

539
00:44:37,148 --> 00:44:39,173
(Rob)
Move it!

540
00:44:41,486 --> 00:44:43,750
Come on!

541
00:44:46,024 --> 00:44:48,322
No. No!

542
00:45:01,206 --> 00:45:03,936
Jesus Christ, they killed him.

543
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:06,033
They cut him. Fuck.

544
00:45:06,111 --> 00:45:07,669
- Hey!
- (barking)

545
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,714
Get him, Honk.

546
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:21,781
Go! Get 'em!

547
00:45:34,072 --> 00:45:36,131
You miss me?

548
00:45:36,207 --> 00:45:38,607
Get in the fucking truck!

549
00:45:49,454 --> 00:45:54,619
Skipping out without paying the tariff
is against the law, slick.

550
00:45:56,027 --> 00:45:59,224
Listen, l don't care
if you guys are growing weed.

551
00:45:59,297 --> 00:46:01,492
l mean, l smoke pot.

552
00:46:01,566 --> 00:46:05,525
Unlawful incarceration is a major crime.

553
00:46:05,603 --> 00:46:07,867
You need to think about
what you're doing.

554
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:10,499
lncarceration.

555
00:46:10,575 --> 00:46:13,635
You fucking lawyer.

556
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:15,736
You gonna sue us, frog-fucker?

557
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:19,675
What about that guy out there?

558
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:21,082
What guy out where?

559
00:46:21,152 --> 00:46:22,380
The guy in the red track suit.

560
00:46:22,453 --> 00:46:24,080
What fucking red track suit, slick?

561
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,453
l can help you.

562
00:46:29,527 --> 00:46:32,121
What's it gonna take?

563
00:46:32,197 --> 00:46:35,462
How much? 100,000?

564
00:46:35,533 --> 00:46:38,468
200,000?

565
00:46:38,536 --> 00:46:41,369
What do you want?

566
00:46:41,439 --> 00:46:43,999
l got what l want.

567
00:46:44,075 --> 00:46:46,908
Come here. Come here!

568
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:52,308
Now take off your pants
and your shoes.

569
00:46:53,718 --> 00:46:56,118
Now!

570
00:46:56,187 --> 00:46:57,552
(grunts)
Yes.

571
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,853
You want a drink, darlin'?

572
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,795
No, merci.

573
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,128
Oh, Oui, oui, oui, merci.

574
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,292
No, thank you.

575
00:47:10,368 --> 00:47:14,031
Fuckin' said yes,
thank you, now drink!

576
00:47:19,811 --> 00:47:21,676
You fucking--

577
00:47:22,847 --> 00:47:23,836
Rob!

578
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:25,212
No!

579
00:47:31,589 --> 00:47:32,783
You wanna fuck her?

580
00:47:32,857 --> 00:47:34,085
Yeah.

581
00:47:35,593 --> 00:47:37,561
No, Rob.
(speaks French)

582
00:47:39,497 --> 00:47:41,556
Now, what was that?

583
00:47:43,268 --> 00:47:45,896
She said she's two months pregnant.

584
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:49,533
She's two months pregnant.

585
00:47:49,607 --> 00:47:53,008
Oh, is that right?
You-- You knocked up?

586
00:47:56,247 --> 00:47:58,078
Yeah.

587
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,259
- Make any difference to you?
- No.

588
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,549
Yeah, well...

589
00:48:10,628 --> 00:48:12,186
Brett here, he ain't fussy.

590
00:48:13,965 --> 00:48:15,956
l don't think he's ever had
a female human before.

591
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,861
Rob!

592
00:48:20,571 --> 00:48:21,833
Aah!

593
00:48:21,906 --> 00:48:24,466
Ohh!

594
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,716
You wanna fuck her now, too?

595
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:39,750
Yeah.

596
00:48:39,824 --> 00:48:41,519
But you squirt your business in the dirt.

597
00:48:41,592 --> 00:48:44,186
l'm not going sloppy seconds.

598
00:48:44,262 --> 00:48:46,025
(banging)

599
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:47,621
Shit!

600
00:48:57,642 --> 00:49:00,110
What the fuck's goin' on in here?

601
00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:03,103
Well, Pa, we was, um...

602
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:08,112
(kicks landing)

603
00:49:08,186 --> 00:49:09,551
(coughing)

604
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:19,152
What's this?

605
00:49:20,298 --> 00:49:22,823
Um, these two busted into the house.

606
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,028
- That's not true.
- Eh!

607
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,471
What's she doing half naked?

608
00:49:32,543 --> 00:49:35,307
Brett and me, we was--
we was gonna fuck her.

609
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,042
Thought it'd be all right.

610
00:49:41,886 --> 00:49:44,081
Why aren't they tied up?

611
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:47,249
He's not goin' anywhere, Papa.
l busted his leg.

612
00:49:47,325 --> 00:49:49,418
Look. Have a look.

613
00:50:08,513 --> 00:50:10,777
- Where's Honky?
- Uh, he's--

614
00:50:10,848 --> 00:50:12,713
He found something to roll,
and he's fucking outside somewhere.

615
00:50:12,784 --> 00:50:13,978
He'll be back.

616
00:50:15,086 --> 00:50:16,246
Hey, Pop,

617
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,652
she's a French chick,
ain't she, Jim?

618
00:50:18,723 --> 00:50:22,352
Get her to say something.
Go on, Pop. Go on.

619
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:33,868
You ain't gonna run off on us,
are ya, baby?

620
00:50:33,938 --> 00:50:36,236
That'd be dangerous.

621
00:50:36,307 --> 00:50:38,104
You see, that dog of ours

622
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:41,373
kind of has this thing
about new blood.

623
00:50:41,446 --> 00:50:43,937
You haven't got your period
coming, have ya, baby?

624
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:48,715
Honky'd have a goddamn party
if you were on the rags.

625
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:52,748
With a dog like that, see,

626
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:59,687
once he chomps down
and them big jaws lock on...

627
00:50:59,764 --> 00:51:03,564
- (sobbing)
- And right after the job's finished,

628
00:51:03,634 --> 00:51:06,125
you can't pry him off with a crowbar.

629
00:51:06,204 --> 00:51:09,196
(sobbing continues)

630
00:51:22,787 --> 00:51:27,383
l see you didn't lock the shed this avo
like l fucking told ya.

631
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:30,985
You know how that
complicates things, don't ya?

632
00:51:31,062 --> 00:51:34,395
- Eh, cool dick?
- (whimpering)

633
00:51:34,465 --> 00:51:37,127
(cries out)
Oh, no, please.

634
00:51:37,201 --> 00:51:40,466
- l told him...
- Shut the-- Fucking shut up!

635
00:51:47,712 --> 00:51:52,081
You see, l just been
out to the back shed,

636
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,778
and someone--

637
00:51:54,852 --> 00:51:58,310
maybe an intruder
and his buck-naked missus--

638
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:00,755
got in there like Goldilocks

639
00:52:00,825 --> 00:52:04,283
and turned the fucking
sprinklers on.

640
00:52:04,362 --> 00:52:08,526
You got any idea what sort
of investment's out there in the shed,

641
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:12,126
going all moldy
and fucking worthless?

642
00:52:12,203 --> 00:52:15,036
(whimpering)

643
00:52:18,576 --> 00:52:21,101
- (whimpering)
- l'll see you inside, sunshine.

644
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,044
We're gonna have
a little fuckin' talk.

645
00:52:23,114 --> 00:52:25,582
(whimpering continues)

646
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,717
(Jimmy)
l fuckin' told him--

647
00:52:30,788 --> 00:52:33,552
l fuckin' told him, shut the fuckin' door.

648
00:52:35,726 --> 00:52:39,560
We'll work out what we're gonna
do with them in the morning.

649
00:52:41,799 --> 00:52:44,165
Now get me a drink.

650
00:52:59,817 --> 00:53:02,479
Honky'll be back in a minute.

651
00:53:02,553 --> 00:53:04,783
He likes to keep
just outside the door.

652
00:53:04,855 --> 00:53:08,848
You wanna be real careful
going outside.

653
00:53:12,797 --> 00:53:14,059
(lock bangs)

654
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,963
Now what was that for?

655
00:53:24,775 --> 00:53:27,403
(groans)

656
00:53:27,478 --> 00:53:28,911
- Fuck!

657
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:33,941
(groans)

658
00:53:36,854 --> 00:53:38,719
(glass shatters)

659
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:42,486
Let's just forget about all the bud
just gone down the fuckin' toilet.

660
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,892
You know l've got prior convictions.

661
00:53:44,962 --> 00:53:47,294
lf l get picked up for this,
then l'm fucked!

662
00:53:47,365 --> 00:53:50,061
And if l'm fucked,
you're double-fucked!

663
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:51,260
'Cause you two will starve

664
00:53:51,335 --> 00:53:54,793
like a pair of orphaned
puppies. Wouldn't ya?

665
00:53:54,872 --> 00:53:56,567
- Eh?

Oh, oh, y-y-yeah, Poppy.

00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:08,407

670
00:54:08,486 --> 00:54:11,546
Christ Al-fuckin'-mighty.

671
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:17,025
S-So, what-- what are we
gonna do about it, Pop?

672
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:23,330
What do you fuckin' reckon?

673
00:54:52,029 --> 00:54:53,291
(groans)

674
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:58,799
- (cracking)
- (groans)

675
00:55:31,268 --> 00:55:33,395
(whistles)
Honky!

676
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:36,870
Honky!

677
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,458
(whistles)
Honky!

678
00:56:04,702 --> 00:56:07,034
(whistles)
Honky!

679
00:56:07,104 --> 00:56:08,867
Where the fuck are ya, boy?

680
00:56:16,113 --> 00:56:17,546
(cries out)

681
00:56:17,615 --> 00:56:21,016
Don't move. Don't move, honey.
(groaning)

682
00:56:22,286 --> 00:56:25,653
What happened?

683
00:56:25,723 --> 00:56:26,747
(groans)

684
00:56:26,824 --> 00:56:29,452
They broke your leg.

685
00:56:30,528 --> 00:56:32,894
Did they touch you?

686
00:56:32,963 --> 00:56:35,625
Did they touch you?

687
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:38,031
No.

688
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:47,744
- Where are they?
- ln the house.

689
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:50,303
But they'll be back.
The father's awake.

690
00:56:51,649 --> 00:56:53,276
What are you doing?

691
00:56:54,318 --> 00:56:56,309
Personal security.

692
00:57:00,124 --> 00:57:02,058
What is that?

693
00:57:02,126 --> 00:57:04,117
A surprise.

694
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:08,457
- Jesus Christ Almighty.
- What?

695
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:13,028
Are you going to stop them
from putting their dicks inside of me?

696
00:57:13,103 --> 00:57:15,071
Maybe we--

697
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:17,664
Maybe what? Maybe what?

698
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:20,471
Maybe the cops
will magically turn up?

699
00:57:20,544 --> 00:57:22,637
Or maybe we should wait
for divine intervention to save us?

700
00:57:22,713 --> 00:57:25,944
So God will strike them dead.
Shall we do that?

701
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:28,314
How do we stop them without
just making them crazier?

702
00:57:28,385 --> 00:57:29,750
l'm not a fighter. Are you?

703
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,119
We're gonna get out of here.

704
00:57:38,896 --> 00:57:40,796
(thunderclap)

705
00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:41,049
My father said to me once,

706
00:59:41,118 --> 00:59:43,382
''To catch a mad dog,

707
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,479
''you must think like a mad dog...

708
00:59:49,293 --> 00:59:51,284
only madder.''

709
01:00:05,809 --> 01:00:08,073
(instrumental)

710
01:00:26,096 --> 01:00:28,087
(Honky barking)

711
01:00:28,165 --> 01:00:29,894
Honky!

712
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:32,094
(barking continues)

713
01:00:32,169 --> 01:00:34,660
Go see what that
fuckin' mongrel's up to.

714
01:00:34,738 --> 01:00:38,139
l don't want him fuckin'
with them till l say.

715
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:40,608
(Brett)
Ah, yeah, Pop.

716
01:00:42,246 --> 01:00:43,645
(Poppy)
You can have the bloke,

717
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:45,238
but you leave me the sheila.

718
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:47,847
Right, yeah, Pop.

719
01:00:47,918 --> 01:00:50,386
(continues)

720
01:01:00,964 --> 01:01:03,694
(Brett)
Honky!

721
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:34,797
(door closes)

722
01:01:49,646 --> 01:01:53,605
(imitates rifle firing, laughing)

723
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,887
Hey. Hey!

724
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:03,188
What's wrong with him?

725
01:02:05,295 --> 01:02:07,058
l think he's in shock.

726
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:09,793
Christ, it's only a busted leg.

727
01:02:16,306 --> 01:02:18,240
Your father hit you because of me?

728
01:02:18,308 --> 01:02:19,900
lt's all right, doll.

729
01:02:19,977 --> 01:02:23,572
We'll call it even
when l pop Volvo here, eh? (chuckling)

730
01:02:23,647 --> 01:02:25,444
You wanna kill him, huh?

731
01:02:25,516 --> 01:02:29,612
You wanna kill him.
l don't believe this.

732
01:02:29,686 --> 01:02:31,415
When l look deep in your eyes,

733
01:02:31,488 --> 01:02:33,319
l can see that you follow your brother.

734
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,587
But you're not like him.
You do not even look like him.

735
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,094
- Well, we got different mothers.
- You see, l'm right.

736
01:02:39,163 --> 01:02:41,028
You're different than him.

737
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:46,025
- Where is your mom now?
- She's gone.

738
01:02:47,704 --> 01:02:49,604
Poppy says women are only good
for gettin' fucked.

739
01:02:49,673 --> 01:02:51,197
Then they eventually try and fuck you.

740
01:02:51,275 --> 01:02:53,106
So l guess he was
finished with her.

741
01:02:53,177 --> 01:02:57,773
No. No. Poppy's wrong.

742
01:02:58,882 --> 01:03:01,112
- No. No.
- Poppy's wrong.

743
01:03:01,185 --> 01:03:03,881
Maybe your mom loves you.
Maybe she wants to be with you.

744
01:03:03,954 --> 01:03:07,856
Shut up! Don't you fucking come in here
telling me what's what!

745
01:03:07,925 --> 01:03:11,190
You say fucking bye to him now!

746

Poppy!

758
01:03:51,468 --> 01:03:52,730

(grunting)

764
01:04:11,588 --> 01:04:13,078
Kill him!

Now, where's Brett?

788
01:07:07,464 --> 01:07:09,329

on a real dark night.

819
01:12:35,425 --> 01:12:36,756
(gasp)

820
01:12:38,294 --> 01:12:40,489
Pity l had to put her down.

821
01:12:54,344 --> 01:12:58,610
l opened up her throat
and bled her like a fuckin' pig.

822
01:12:59,816 --> 01:13:03,445
Hung her out there
in the shed for a month.

823
01:13:07,056 --> 01:13:09,217
Christ, the stink.

824
01:13:11,394 --> 01:13:14,727
She smelled bad enough
when she was alive.

825
01:13:20,937 --> 01:13:24,100
Had to put her
through the mulcher in the end.

826
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:29,040
Turned her into fertilizer...

827
01:13:31,114 --> 01:13:33,742
and dog food.

828
01:13:36,152 --> 01:13:38,416
Finally found a use for the bitch.

(laughs)

830
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,032
You know why l stuck her?

831
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,401
She didn't follow the rules.

832
01:14:03,413 --> 01:14:06,849
- (groans)
- Yeah.

833

No.

834

That's good.

835
01:14:09,919 --> 01:14:11,944
But, no.

836
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,795
l guess l just did it

837
01:14:19,863 --> 01:14:23,094
so she wouldn't have
to suffer like the others.

838
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:24,724
Eh?

839
01:14:26,936 --> 01:14:31,236
We're gonna be gone
around New Year's. Aren't we, eh?

840
01:14:32,809 --> 01:14:34,834
