revolution on my hands...

very successfully.

477

Psychoplasmics therapy or not?

Even if we lose, people'll get nervous
about Psychoplasmics.

489
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:52,745
It will be bad publicity.

They won't even remember
whether we won or lost.

"Psychoplasmics can cause cancer."

but, uh, your receptionist
wasn't too helpful.

Yes, well, she probably knew
I was on my way to...

509
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:17,142
Did you know that Nola's
mother died yesterday,

510
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:18,705
that she was murdered?

511
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:21,708
Yes. The police spoke to me.

- Then you've told her?
- No, I haven't.

Well, then,
that's why I'm here... to tell her.

514
00:38:29,591 --> 00:38:33,345
Mr. Kelly, your wife's death
was a tragic and shocking thing.

515
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:35,556
That's why Nola must not be told.

516
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,350
What?

517
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:41,895
Nola is going through
a very critical stage in her therapy.

518
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:43,981
I'm not sure she could take it.

519

Are you saying that I'm just supposed
to bury the girl's mother...

520
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,195
and not tell her about it?

521

Yes, that's what I'm saying.

You are one ignorant

she had me alone...

she got me to play

No.

But the palate is not.

670

for proper speech.

676

It contains traces
of a solid nutrient material...

677
00:52:14,957 --> 00:52:17,001
a bit like the yolk sac of certain fish...

678

or a... camel's hump.

679
00:52:20,755 --> 00:52:23,883
Basically, it's a gas tank.
It was full at birth.

680
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:28,304
Once the hump material
is completely assimilated...

681

simply starves to death.

That's right.

And that means this creature

01:15:39,152 --> 01:15:42,697
Raglan, I'm not gonna listen.

957
01:15:42,781 --> 01:15:45,116
They're her children, Frank.

958
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:48,161
More exactly,
they're the children of her rage.

959
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:50,163
They're motivated only by her anger...

960
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:54,000
whether that anger
is conscious or subconscious.

961
01:15:54,084 --> 01:15:58,213
I mean, when... When Nola got cross
with Candy last weekend...

962
01:15:58,296 --> 01:16:00,256
annoyed really...

963
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,383
the brood beat her.

964
01:16:02,467 --> 01:16:06,221
But when she released her rage
against her parents under therapy...

965
01:16:07,347 --> 01:16:09,015
then they killed them.

966
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,061
Now, I didn't want to believe that.

967
01:16:13,144 --> 01:16:15,063
But now they've killed Ruth Mayer.

968
01:16:15,146 --> 01:16:18,733
And they could kill you or me,
and she wouldn't even be aware of it.

969
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:22,320
I mean, she doesn't even
know that Candy's here.

970
01:16:25,865 --> 01:16:27,700
I want Candice back.

971
01:16:27,784 --> 01:16:29,786
Then do it my way.

972
01:16:29,869 --> 01:16:33,373
Please. It's the right way.

973
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:37,502
What do you want me to do?

974
01:16:38,503 --> 01:16:40,964
I want you to go back into that hut...

975
01:16:41,047 --> 01:16:44,134
and persuade Nola
that you want her back...

976
01:16:44,217 --> 01:16:46,636
that you want your family back.

977
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,598
I want you to play the role
of apologetic lover and husband.

978
01:16:50,682 --> 01:16:51,808
Why?

979
01:16:51,891 --> 01:16:55,019
Because if you can
keep Nola calm and happy...

980
01:16:55,103 --> 01:16:57,522
then the brood's neutral.

981
01:16:57,605 --> 01:16:59,649
If she's mellow...

982
01:16:59,732 --> 01:17:02,152
then I can just walk into that attic...

983
01:17:02,235 --> 01:17:04,946
pick up Candy,
tuck her under my arm and walk out.

984
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:07,574
Now, can you do that?

985
01:17:10,535 --> 01:17:12,078
I don't know.

986
01:17:13,288 --> 01:17:15,915
Frank, if things go wrong...

987
01:17:15,999 --> 01:17:19,127
if Nola gets angry, if the kids get angry...

988
01:17:21,379 --> 01:17:23,548
You understand?

989
01:17:23,631 --> 01:17:26,718
I'm not going to be the only one
to pay for that anger.

990
01:17:26,801 --> 01:17:29,095
Raglan, I don't trust you.

991
01:17:32,265 --> 01:17:33,975
What does it matter?

992
01:17:35,143 --> 01:17:38,146
I'll move up there
30 seconds after you're in.

993
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,282
Frank, be nice to her.

994
01:18:26,069 --> 01:18:27,570
Hal?

995
01:18:29,656 --> 01:18:32,492
It's me, Nola. It's Frank.

996
01:18:36,204 --> 01:18:38,206
Frank?

997
01:18:38,289 --> 01:18:40,583
Am I dreaming?

998
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:44,504
I thought you said you weren't going
to come and see me while I was here.

999
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,343
Well, I think that was a misunderstanding.

1000
01:18:55,223 --> 01:18:57,225
That's why I'm here.

1001
01:18:58,851 --> 01:19:01,354
I want us to understand each other.

1002
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:46,357
You're the only woman in the world for me.

1003
01:19:46,441 --> 01:19:49,193
You always have been. You always will be.

1004
01:19:50,194 --> 01:19:52,322
That won't ever change.

1005
01:19:53,573 --> 01:19:55,491
I want you to know that.

1006
01:19:55,575 --> 01:19:59,620
I wish it were true.
God, I wish it were true.

1007
01:20:29,067 --> 01:20:30,860
We've lost touch.

1008
01:20:32,278 --> 01:20:35,782
That's the only reason
all this ever happened.

1009
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:39,952
All we have to do is make sure
we don't lose touch again.

1010
01:20:41,287 --> 01:20:44,290
Isolation is part of my therapy, Frank.

1011
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:50,046
What's been happening to me
has been just too strange...

1012
01:20:50,129 --> 01:20:55,093
too strange for me to share
with anyone from my old life.

1013
01:20:56,302 --> 01:20:59,639
Then make me a part of your new life.

1014

Let me be part of it.

I wasn't before, but I'm ready now.

1018

Are you ready for me, Frank?

1019

Are you really?

1020
01:21:34,882 --> 01:21:37,927
I seem to be a very special person.

1021

I'm in the middle of a strange adventure.
