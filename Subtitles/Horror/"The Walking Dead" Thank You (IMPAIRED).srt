Rick: That exit sends
them right at us.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,561
We force them west here...

4
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:08,762
Away from the community.

5
00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:11,065
They'll follow a path if
something's drawing them.

7

00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:15,335
You gotta be quiet.

11
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:17,437
Rick: Why don't you head back?

12
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:18,505
Tell everyone what's happening.

17
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:22,842

Tobin, it's not stopping.
Light it up. You hear me?

- Got it.

Shit! Shit!
It was half.

30
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:01,112
Jesus, it was more than half.

31
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:02,646
We just gotta stay
ahead of them.

32
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:04,414
They walk, we run.

33

- Daryl on radio: <i>Rick!</i>
<i>- I'm here.</i>

<i>What's going on back there?</i>

35
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:09,519
Rick:
Half of them broke off.

36
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:11,188
<i>They're going toward Alexandria.</i>

37
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,592
Towards you?

38
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:19,095
We ran ahead.
There's a horn or something.

39
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:21,697
Loud, coming from the east.
It's not stopping.

40
00:01:21,699 --> 00:01:24,067
I'm gonna gas it up, turn back.

41
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,602
Rick: <i>We have it.
You keep going.</i>

42
00:01:26,604 --> 00:01:28,071
They're gonna need our help.

43
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:30,272
Gotta keep the herd moving.

44
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:31,907
Daryl: Not if it's
going down, <i>we don't.</i>

45
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:33,541
The rest of that herd
turns around,

46
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:35,244
the bad back there gets worse.

47
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,547
<i>Daryl?</i>

48
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,049
Yeah, I heard you.

- Ah!
- You okay?

52
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:57,231
It's my ankle.

53
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:00,101
All right, come on.
Grab on. Let's go.

54
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,735
Come on.

55
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:03,837
It's coming from back home.

56
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,939
- It has to be.
- He did this.

57
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:08,909
He brought us all
out here to die.

58
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,044
- He killed Carter.
- Carter was dead already.

59
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:13,914
Now they're in trouble
back there and we're done.

60
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,983
- We're good as dead.
- Hey, calm down.

61
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:18,451
What the hell
are you talking about?

62
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:21,153
We are done.
And it's 'cause of him.

63
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:23,488
Shut up and move.

64
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,424
Come on.

65
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,666
Damn it.

66
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:37,735
All right, listen up.
Here's the new plan.

67
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:41,072
I go back, get the RV, circle
around the woods on Redding.

68
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:42,974
I'll get in front of them
before they get there.

69
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:44,408
I can lead them away again.

70
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,344
RV's a mile back.
I can go with you.

71
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:48,346
I'll handle it.
Just get home.

72
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:50,081
They might need you there.

73
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:53,284
Glenn, Michonne.

74
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:56,486
If something's in front
of you, you kill it.

75
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:58,856
No hiding, no waiting.
You keep going.

76
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:00,824
I'm going with you. You
can't do this on your own.

77
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,792
- Glenn, I can do this.
- You need to help me.

78
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:05,462
- We've got to get these people back.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:09,132
Thing is, they aren't
all gonna make it.

80
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:11,300
- Rick.
- You try to save them, you try,

81
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:13,635
but they can't keep up,
you keep going.

82
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:16,538
You have to. You make
sure you get back.

20 minutes, maybe.

we all get back home.

know what's waiting for us.

David: It's gonna be okay.
We have walls for a reason.

plowed right through.

Figure out how
to make this go right.

We're moving in the same
direction everything else is.

107
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,893
We're gonna catch up
with something.

108

We're gonna catch up

You got a reason for asking?

Next intersection we're gonna

Five's gonna have to work.

Aaron found me.

145
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:10,402
I was alone, lost everything.

We found Betsy on the way
back to the community.

She still saw me.

After I thought
I was dead and gone,

155
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:41,397
she was my first friend.

<i>Then she was more.</i>

157

<i>Even better than</i>
<i>how I used to be.</i>

159

But if I could make it back,
I'd want to say good-bye.

160
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:57,013
Tell her...

161
00:10:57,015 --> 00:11:00,616

00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,985
that was everything.

00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:10,059
We need to stop
and bandage him up.

164
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:13,929
No, we keep moving.
I'm okay.

165
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:16,197
You won't be if we don't
stop your bleeding.

166
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:21,268
We'll find a place.

167
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,805
Can't stop out
in the open too long.

168
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:27,208
Come on.

169
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:36,016
Let's check if these
cars work first.

170
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:38,151
See if they can get us back.

171
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:40,220
I'll stay with them.

172
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:54,366
(hammer clicks)

173
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:09,580
Listen, I need to get home,

174
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:12,083
but I'm not leaving them behind.

175
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:15,153
We patch Scott up, we get going.

176
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:17,922
Rick knows what he knows.

177
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:19,691
We're ahead of the herd.

178
00:12:19,693 --> 00:12:21,726
Maybe half an hour now.

179
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:24,061
We can stop.
We can make it.

180
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:31,368
This is halfway home, right?

181
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,037
Yeah.

182
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:37,074
This is where it happened.

183
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:41,377
I said it at the dealership.

184
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:43,612
Me and Aiden didn't know
what we were doing.

185
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:46,983
The people
on your crew who died?

186
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:51,921
They weren't afraid.

187
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:53,723
We were.

188
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,799
Glenn:
<i>No luck.</i>

189
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:05,734
We have to stay on foot.

190
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:09,037
Nicholas was here last.

191
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,106
He can show us the way.

192
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:16,711
Uh, okay.

193
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:20,647
All right.

194
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:28,388
Glenn:
There's no cars.

195
00:13:30,558 --> 00:13:32,959
I got you.
I got you.

196
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:47,240
Oh, Jesus.

197
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:48,974
Sturgess?

198
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,113
He left us behind.

205
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:33,605
We stay quiet,

206
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:35,441
patch Scott and Annie up,

207
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:36,943
get out of here.

208
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:40,079
Those walkers in the alley
and down the street,

209
00:15:40,081 --> 00:15:42,381
they're blocking
the way out of town.

210
00:15:42,383 --> 00:15:46,185
We can't take 'em on, not
in the shape that we're in.

211
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:49,020
We'll have to lead them
away if we have to.

212
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,189
Because that's been
working well lately.

213
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:55,293
I'm trying here.

214
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:57,262
I'm not giving up.

215
00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:59,697
Yeah, not yet.

216
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:06,971
Hey, I was thinking,

217
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:09,539
if we can find a way to
distract the herd coming in,

218
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,375
then they won't make it
back to the community.

219
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:12,609
How?

220
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:14,711
Burn one of the buildings.

221
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:16,480
Hopefully more.

222
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:18,615
They'll get drawn to it
and they'll stop here.

223
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:20,650
It's gonna take some time.

224
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,785
I'll do it.
You stay with them.

225
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:24,921
It's my plan.
It's on me.

226
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:27,223
You have a wife, Glenn.

227
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:29,792
That's why I'm doing this.

228
00:16:29,794 --> 00:16:31,660
You've got to get
everybody back.

229

You're the one who can.

230
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:36,199
If I take too long, you just go.

231
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:38,300
I'm not leaving without you.

232
00:16:38,302 --> 00:16:41,469
- That is not the way this works.
- I will meet you there.

233
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,639
If I get stuck out here, I'll find
some way to show you guys I'm okay.

234
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:48,243
We all have a job to do.

235
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:53,949
There's a feed store.

236
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:57,118
It's old.
A lot of dry stuff inside.

237
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,685
It should go up easy.

238
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,255
I'll go with you.

239

I can draw a map.

No.

241

You lead the way.

Have you ever done things that made you
feel afraid of yourself afterward?

303
