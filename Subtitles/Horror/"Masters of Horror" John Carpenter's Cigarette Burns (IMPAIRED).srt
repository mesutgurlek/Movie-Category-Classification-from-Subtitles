** [eerie piano]

5
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:51,784
[Man, narrating] Film is magic.

6
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:54,860
And in the right hands,
a weapon.

7
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,667
[buzzer]

8
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:00,974
[Man, over intercom] Hello?
Yeah, you called me?

9
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:02,054
From the Vogue?

10
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:04,300
[gate disengages]

11
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:46,701
You are late. Mr. Bellinger
is waiting for you.

12
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:36,618
[Austrian accent] Mr. Sweetman.

13
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:39,851
Mr. Bellinger.

14
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:41,784
Wow, you have an incredible collection.

15
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:44,051
Thank you.

16
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:46,718
I'm sure you have
some rare pieces of your own.

17
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:49,851
Not really.
It's too expensive.

18
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:55,417
Must be a torture--
hunting down pieces for others,

19
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:58,718
to have something in your hands,
only to give it up immediately.

20
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:00,584
Well, there's perks.

21
00:04:00,684 --> 00:04:03,851
When I track down a rare print,
I get to screen it.

22
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,563
Quality-assurance purposes,
of course.

23
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,333
Of course.

24
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:12,651
La Fin Absolue du Monde.

25
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,484
The absolute end of the world.

26
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:16,651
What do you know about it?

27
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:20,117
I know it played once,
opening night premiere,

28
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:23,818
the Festival International
du Cinema Fantastique.

29
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,351
Violence erupted in the theater.

30
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:29,244
When Hans Backovic,
the director, tried

31
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:30,701
to get it out of the country,

32
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:33,250
the government seized it
and destroyed it,

33
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,248
not realizing it was a work in progress

34
00:04:36,348 --> 00:04:37,718
and its only print.

35
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:41,304
He quit the business.
That film's only been seen

36
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:42,918
by that one audience.

37
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:44,584
You did your homework.

38
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:48,734
But the government
didn't destroy the film.

39
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,068
What's this?

40
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:01,500
A prop from the film.

41
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,884
I'm a bit obsessive about
La Fin Absolue du Monde.

42
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:09,384
Why this particular film?

43
00:05:09,484 --> 00:05:12,497
[smirks] I have a collection

44
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:14,718
of over 8,000 films,

45
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:16,884
the most extreme images,

46
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,533
created by some of the most
obscure filmmakers from

47
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:20,467
around the world.

48
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:23,478
I'm not about to drag you
up here in the middle

49
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:24,300
of the night

50
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,584
for something that made
a schoolgirl dizzy.

51
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:31,867
I'm talking about real power.

52
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,300
Were you at the festival
when this played?

53
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:37,618
Yes.

54
00:05:37,718 --> 00:05:40,117
I even had tickets for the screening.

55
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:42,798
But I had seen Backovic's previous work

56
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:44,400
and I wasn't impressed.

57
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,651
So I went to see
the first "Dr. Phibes" instead,

58
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:52,217
hoping to meet Vincent Price.

59
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:56,818
In '83, the Rotterdam Festival
announced a screening.

60
00:05:56,918 --> 00:05:59,964
By the time I'd flown there,
they had canceled it,

61
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:01,467
saying it was an error.

62
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:05,157
The fact that the venue
had burned down must have had

63
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:06,887
something to do with it.

64
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:12,951
Every mention of the film since '71,

65
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:15,751
every rumor about underground screenings,

66
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:19,300
the official report
from Sitges, Mr. Sweetman.

67
00:06:20,434 --> 00:06:21,967
Why are you giving me this?

68
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,467
Isn't it obvious?

69
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:30,767
I want you to find the print for me.

70
00:06:32,634 --> 00:06:34,723
Finding a rare print
can be costly, even under

71
00:06:34,823 --> 00:06:35,867
the best circumstances.

72
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:39,517
But La Fin Absolue du Monde
is-- it's infamous.

73
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:41,018
It's rarer than rare.

74
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:43,634
If there was a print
out there, I'd know it.

75
00:06:45,434 --> 00:06:47,551
It is out there,

76
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:49,751
believe me.

77
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:51,734
My sources are unimpeachable.

78
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,101
Follow me.

79
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,801
I have to show you something.

80
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:17,759
As you can see,
I collect more than movies,

81
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:18,967
Mr. Sweetman.

82
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:24,134
Meet one of the stars
of La Fin Absolue du Monde.

83
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,034
[moans]

84
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:45,801
Tell Mr. Sweetman what you told me.

85
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:49,718
We are a part of the film,

86
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:53,451
bound to the negative,
like soul to flesh.

87
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:56,795
If it had been destroyed,
we would know.

88
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:58,517
[Bellinger chuckles]

89
00:07:58,617 --> 00:08:00,529
[Bellinger] I did terrible things

90
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:01,233
in my life.

91
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:05,184
I know, full well,
what will happen

92
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,217
to this desiccated captive I call a soul.

93
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:13,584
Call me crazy, but I wanted
at least a taste of heaven

94
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:16,934
before an eternity of hell.

95
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:21,818
Money is no object.

96
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,451
I pay all your expenses

97
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:26,901
and $100,000 on the top.

98
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,784
I'm not a well man,

99
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:34,384
and my days are numbered.

100
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:39,333
But I don't want to die
without having seen this film.

101
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,484
Why me?

102
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:46,267
Because you have great taste
as a programmer.

103
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,018
You see it as a shit box.

104
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:53,618
You have 800 seats,

105
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:56,748
and you are happy to sell
50 tickets a night.

106
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:57,498
[whimpers]

107
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,667
Find this copy for me.

108
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,951
And after I've seen it,

109
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:07,618
I'll give it to you for a two-weeks' run.

110
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:10,967
I promise I wouldn't give it
to any other theater.

111
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:21,001
You need it.

112
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:23,517
200,000.

113
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:25,434
[chuckles]

114
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,634
200,000.

115
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,300
A deal?

116
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:41,934
[laughs]

117
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:12,134
There you are,
you son of a bitch.

118
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:55,651
[Woman's voice] * Kirby Sweetman *

119
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:59,634
* Is my sweet man *

120
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,267
Are you my sweet man, Kirby?

121
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,801
Will you take care of me, always?

122
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,618
Hey, Timpson, what's up?

123
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:29,651
Our last show will be over
in about 15 minutes.

124
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:31,367
Profondo Rosso,
ready to go.

125
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,967
Did you, uh-- you get your souvenir?

126
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:35,334
Dude.

127
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:38,317
It's Argento.
Had to do it.

128
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,618
What's it with you
and the cigarette burns?

129
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:44,231
When you're watching a film
and one of those bugs appears,

130
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:45,001
it lets you know

131
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:47,584
something's gonna happen.

132
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:50,517
"Hold on. Here it comes."

133
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:52,267
You take 'em out...

134
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,851
all of a sudden, it's anarchy.

135
00:11:54,951 --> 00:11:58,315
All right, Mr. Anarchy,
try not to burn the place down

136
00:11:58,415 --> 00:11:59,267
when I'm away.

137
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,918
Did you get a new client?
Yeah, yeah.

138
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:05,451
An incredible offer.
The guy kind of freaks me out.

139
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:08,317
What film is it this time?

140
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,967
La Fin Absolue du Monde.

141
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,233
[gasps]

142
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,400
No shit?

143
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:18,634
No shit.

144
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:47,172
[woman, voiceover] Kirby knows absolutely

145
00:12:47,272 --> 00:12:48,734
everything about movies.

146
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,985
And the theater-- It's beautiful.

147
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,085
[sniffs] It just needs a little work.

148
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:57,417
Yeah. We could do it ourselves.

149
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:59,384
Think of it as a wedding present.

150
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:02,684
Okay?
[sniffs]

151
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:05,770
Why don't you wait in the car,
sweetheart, while Kirby and I

152
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,901
work out the details?

153
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:08,500
Okay.

154
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:27,300
This is not a gift.
It's a loan.

155
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:34,451
Get your shit together.

156
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:37,233
Get her shit together.

157
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:41,134
Don't make me sorry.

158
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:19,200
Excuse me, sir,
but we're not open yet.

159
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:23,317
Oh, Mr. Matthews.

160
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:26,484
Listen, Kirby's not here right now.

161
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,500
[stuttering] I can tell him you came--

162
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,734
Oh, wow, look at that.

163
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:36,851
You're a hard man to get hold of.

164
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,784
It's almost like you're avoiding me.

165
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:41,634
Why would I avoid you?
You're so much fun

166
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:42,594
to be around.

167
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:44,684
We need to talk.

168
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,077
I don't have time
to talk to you right now.

169
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,801
How about a check for 200,000?

170
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,985
Got time to talk about that?
I'll get your money.

171
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:53,217
When?
Soon!

172
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:56,018
No, I don't believe that.

173
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:58,018
I don't believe anything you say.

174
00:14:58,118 --> 00:15:01,454
Look, I know that
you're not gonna go away

175
00:15:01,554 --> 00:15:03,718
until I get you your money,

176
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:07,018
but every time you stop by,
every time you call--

177
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:09,317
I feel like I'm getting cut open.

178
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:12,284
I see Annie's face every day,
all day long.

179
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:14,364
You have no idea what I'm going through

180
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:15,767
to get you out of my life.

181
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:20,184
You've got one week.
If you can't get the money,

182
00:15:20,284 --> 00:15:23,184
I'll take great delight
in coming down here

183
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:27,267
and tearing this shit hole down.

184
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,584
[gasps, exhales]

185
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:52,034
A.K. Meyers.

186
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:56,851
I've read all this guy's shit.
Good critic.

187
00:15:56,951 --> 00:16:00,304
Big fan of the esoteric,
and out of all Kale's disciples,

188
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:01,934
the most original thinker.

189
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:06,484
"In order to fully appreciate
La Fin Absolue du Monde,

190
00:16:06,584 --> 00:16:09,184
"one must understand the context
in which it premiered.

191
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:11,636
"The Sitges Festival is still
young, but there is a boldness

192
00:16:11,736 --> 00:16:12,500
to their programming

193
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,551
"that makes this
an essential stop for any fan

194
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:18,918
"of what are typically
thought of as lesser genres:

195
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:22,250
science fiction, fantasy or horror."

196
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,985
What's he up to these days?
I don't know.

197
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:29,115
He lives upstate New York,
kind of a recluse.

198
00:16:29,215 --> 00:16:31,265
I'll tell you when I get back.

199
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,734
[typewriter keys clacking]

200
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:35,591
Mr. Meyers, can I speak to you, please?

201
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:36,400
[Meyers] Go away.

202
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,851
It's important.
It'll just take a minute.

203
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:41,264
Who sent you?
No one sent me.

204
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:42,985
It's about a review.

205
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:45,484
I'm done with that.
I won't discuss any review.

206
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:48,384
It's about La Fin Absolue du Monde.

207
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,001
[door buzzer]

208
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:53,500
[typing resumes]

209
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,120
Did they pass out any press
notes at the Sitges screening?

210
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,734
They did.

211
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:02,156
Did you happen to save any of those?

212
00:18:02,256 --> 00:18:02,601
I did.

213
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,990
I'd love to read those or anything else

214
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,300
you have on the film.

215
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,317
Dangerous.

216
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:11,484
Backovic said, "Film, in
the right hands, is a weapon."

217
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:12,801
He was right.

218
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,684
"La Fin Absolue du Monde is not a movie,

219
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:25,274
but more like a bullet

220
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,797
"fired directly into
the collective brain pan

221
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:29,200
of all that is assembled,

222
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,651
and the only rational response
is violence."

223
00:18:31,751 --> 00:18:33,985
We trust filmmakers.

224
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:37,417
We sit in the dark,
daring them to effect us,

225
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:40,217
secure in the knowledge
that they won't go too far.

226
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:44,284
I've read your review twice on the plane

227
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:46,784
and I still have no idea
what this movie's about.

228
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:49,051
Hans Backovic was a terrorist.

229
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:52,517
He abused the trust
we place in filmmakers.

230
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,911
He didn't want to hurt
his audience, he wanted

231
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:56,367
to destroy them completely.

232
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:59,590
I've seen extreme gore
and it never made me crazy

233
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,367
or violent.

234
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:02,346
What is it about La Fin Absolue du Monde

235
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:03,434
that is so dangerous?

236
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:05,928
Backovic was brilliant.
But all that violence

237
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:06,867
in the theater--

238
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:08,667
that was all exaggerated, right?

239
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:15,250
If anything, the incident was downplayed.

240
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,784
I watched four people die.

241
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:21,918
It smelled like a slaughterhouse.

242
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:25,151
The center isle was slick with blood.

243
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:28,417
Backovic knew what he was doing.

244
00:19:28,517 --> 00:19:31,184
When Stravinsky's"Rite of
Spring"premiered to riots,

245
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:33,085
it was an accident.

246
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:37,284
La Fin Absolue du Monde
was no accident. He told me so.

247
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,651
Wait-- You spoke to Backovic?

248
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:41,784
At the start of the festival.

249
00:19:41,884 --> 00:19:45,051
He told me exactly
what was going to happen.

250
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,718
I recorded the whole interview.

251
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,701
Could I listen to that tape?

252
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:55,284
People weren't ready.
They still aren't.

253
00:19:55,384 --> 00:19:57,351
That review I published was a joke.

254
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,985
It doesn't begin to describe the film.

255
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:03,255
I was given the opportunity
to be the messenger

256
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:04,215
and I failed.

257
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:07,751
But you'll see.

258
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:11,217
People will understand
as soon as I finish

259
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:12,434
my new review.

260
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,618
Is that what this is,
all of this?

261
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:20,367
That one review?
It's almost finished now.

262
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:26,267
There's a chance that there
still may be a print out there.

263
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:31,117
I was hired to find it.

264
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:32,451
To what purpose?

265
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:34,300
To show it.

266
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,034
[laughs]

267
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:46,967
You should know
what you're getting in to.

268
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:52,051
You're right.

269
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,884
The film is still alive.

270
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:59,384
Even if they tried
to destroy it, they couldn't.

271
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:02,267
Some films are meant to be seen.

272
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:04,484
These--

273
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:08,434
These will change your life.

274
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:12,051
Promise me--

275
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:14,618
Promise me,
when you find the film,

276
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:16,317
you'll let me see it again.

277
00:21:16,417 --> 00:21:20,985
I've dreamed about it
every night for 30 years,

278
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:23,367
laying eyes on it again.

279
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:31,818
Once you start this,
you can't just shake it off

280
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:33,567
and walk away.

281
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:37,300
It gets inside you.

282
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:51,192
[Meyers, on tape] Mr. Backovic, this is

283
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:52,601
your third feature film.

284
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:55,253
[Backovic] Well, I prefer not

285
00:21:55,353 --> 00:21:57,351
to categorize any film.

286
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,684
What difference does running time make?

287
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:02,250
The mechanics of film,
the language,

288
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,951
that is what matters.

289
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:05,277
[Meyers] Your work, so far,

290
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:06,367
has been experimental.

291
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:09,051
You eschew conventional narrative.

292
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:11,184
[Backovic scoffs] Narrative is dead.

293
00:22:11,284 --> 00:22:13,918
Hollywood is shit.

294
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:16,284
Film, it's not entertainment.

295
00:22:16,384 --> 00:22:17,884
[explosion]

296
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:20,068
[high-pitched tone]

297
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,200
[water dripping]

298
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:52,367
[screams]

299
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:01,901
[sighs, turns off tape recorder]

300
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:05,667
[telephone rings]

301
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:11,410
Bonjour, Monsieur Sweetman.

302
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,667
This is your wake-up call.

303
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,801
[sighs]

304
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:16,834
Oh, fuck.

305
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:19,467
[exhales]

306
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,400
[grunts]

307
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,135
So you're on the hunt again, Kirby?

308
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:29,667
Yeah, but this is different.

309
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:32,217
I'm looking for something
that may not exist anymore.

310
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:34,751
You chose an inopportune time,
I'm afraid.

311
00:23:34,851 --> 00:23:37,533
We are reorganizing
the accounts. Everything's

312
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,100
in boxes, as you can see.

313
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,600
But if you give me the title--
La Fin Absolue du Monde.

314
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:45,634
Vous êtes fou.

315
00:23:47,701 --> 00:23:50,018
Did you just call me a name--

316
00:23:50,118 --> 00:23:52,151
Who asked you to do this?
A private collector.

317
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:53,890
Then he's the fool.
Don't help him.

318
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,133
I may not have a choice.

319
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,279
I'm up to my neck in debt.
This job could turn

320
00:23:57,379 --> 00:23:58,167
everything around.

321
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:01,250
Don't do it for the money.
It's not worth it.

322
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,642
This guy came to me because
he knew I could find anything.

323
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:06,334
I'd like to prove him right.

324
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:08,551
Besides, I'd like to see the film.

325
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:12,489
How much do you know about
La Fin Absolue du Monde

326
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:13,951
and Hans Backovic?

327
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:16,718
Not enough. I talked
to A.K. Meyers about it.

328
00:24:16,818 --> 00:24:19,254
Nice choice.
Most people start with Sitges

329
00:24:19,354 --> 00:24:21,001
and try to drag it that way.

330
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:23,051
Most people?

331
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:25,867
You don't think you're the first
to look for this film, do you?

332
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,918
If you know so much about it,
why don't you help me?

333
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:33,176
You can use my assistant's
office next door.

334
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:34,851
But it's not in there.

335
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:37,701
You have to earn this movie.

336
00:25:06,134 --> 00:25:07,902
What do you know about Patton League?

337
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:08,934
The cinematographer?

338
00:25:09,034 --> 00:25:12,166
You think you can help me?
A tragic story, that. He went

339
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:14,068
blind after they made the movie.

340
00:25:14,168 --> 00:25:17,751
You have to understand, he won't
even speak Backovic's name.

341
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:21,284
The last person to ask him
about La Fin Absolue du Monde,

342
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:24,469
he got six stitches
from where League smacked him

343
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:25,434
with his cane.

344
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:27,417
What's with all the mystery?

345
00:25:27,517 --> 00:25:29,587
There's a wall of silence
around this film,

346
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:31,100
around Backovic's whole life!

347
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,511
If I could just talk to him for a secon--

348
00:25:33,611 --> 00:25:34,367
And he's dead.

349
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:36,077
There's no records that he's dead.

350
00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:36,567
Trust me.

351
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,851
Backovic is quite dead.

352
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:41,151
Who told you that?
His family? His friends?

353
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:44,141
Anybody you can introduce me to?
I'm sorry,

354
00:25:44,241 --> 00:25:45,801
I can tell you no more.

355
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,200
[speaking in French]

356
00:26:19,734 --> 00:26:21,434
[door opens]

357
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,767
[door closes]

358
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:48,384
Henri.

359
00:26:48,484 --> 00:26:51,417
You disappoint me.
You should not be here.

360
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:53,781
I thought we were friends.
But you know more

361
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,068
than you're telling me.

362
00:26:55,168 --> 00:26:57,189
That film that you're holding--
that's one of Backovic's

363
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:58,068
short films, isn't it?

364
00:26:58,168 --> 00:27:00,590
You do not understand.
I don't understand anything

365
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,801
that's happening to me.

366
00:27:01,901 --> 00:27:04,117
Last night I saw something I-- A circle?

367
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:06,834
Huh? Like the reel change in the movie?

368
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:09,667
Yeah.

369
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:12,517
Then it's started.

370
00:27:12,617 --> 00:27:14,584
You're already in it.

371
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:16,918
It's only going to get worse from here.

372
00:27:17,018 --> 00:27:18,667
What? What's happening to me?

373
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,154
When you look for this film,
the more you will see

374
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:21,801
those burns.

375
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:25,191
You'll pay for every step closer
you'll take. I'm trying

376
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,334
to do you a favor.

377
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:28,684
I'm telling you to walk away
because I like you.

378
00:27:28,784 --> 00:27:31,451
I've been where you are
right now. I've felt

379
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:33,334
that same building curiosity,

380
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,985
like an unscratchable itch.

381
00:27:36,085 --> 00:27:38,684
I had to know.

382
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,667
I had to see it.

383
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,540
I was the projectionist
at the private screening

384
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,150
in 1988.

385
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,284
The faces in that room--

386
00:27:51,384 --> 00:27:54,500
Famous, beautiful people
from all over Europe.

387
00:27:56,001 --> 00:27:58,117
When I threaded the film
into the projector,

388
00:27:58,217 --> 00:28:01,117
I saw those same dots you described.

389
00:28:01,217 --> 00:28:03,801
And when I actually started it running...

390
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:08,267
I lost my nerve,
I looked away.

391
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:13,784
It was playing right there,
right in front of me

392
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:17,068
and I was too frightened to watch.

393
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:24,417
When the screaming started
and the smell of blood hit me,

394
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:26,751
I tried to stop the film.

395
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:29,919
The projector wouldn't shut off
and I grabbed the film

396
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:30,734
to rip it out

397
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,985
and then I saw those same circles.

398
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:36,233
And...I don't know.

399
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,918
I must have blacked out.

400
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:41,634
Time seemed to drop away.

401
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,248
When I came to,
the film was over and my hand...

402
00:28:48,348 --> 00:28:48,718
Look,

403
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:51,835
I appreciate you trying
to protect me, I really do.

404
00:28:51,935 --> 00:28:52,867
But I need this.

405
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:55,677
And I won't watch the film,
and I won't play it

406
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:56,567
at my theater.

407
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,834
I'll give it to this collector
and walk away.

408
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:09,684
If I were you,
I would not call this number.

409
00:29:09,784 --> 00:29:13,317
This man has an excellent
collection, but he's dangerous.

410
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:14,784
Does he have the film?

411
00:29:14,884 --> 00:29:16,618
No.

412
00:29:16,718 --> 00:29:19,779
But he does have items given to him by

413
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:21,451
the Backovic estate.

414
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,051
God knows why.

415
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:26,333
He can get in touch with him for you.

416
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:05,467
[speaking in French]

417
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:52,920
[stuttering] It's not for me.

418
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,818
It's for a client.

419
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:57,042
[speaks with foreign accent]
But you're curious,

420
00:30:57,142 --> 00:30:57,601
aren't you?

421
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:01,085
If Henri sent you to me, then
you've had your first glimpses.

422
00:31:01,185 --> 00:31:05,233
Glimpses?
Glimpses of what?

423
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,884
It's different for everyone.

424
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:11,451
What you see isn't the important part.

425
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:13,651
It's the way you change.

426
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,117
It's what the film
does to you that matters.

427
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:19,400
Have you seen the film?
No.

428
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:23,484
Would you if you got the chance?

429
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:24,767
Of course.

430
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:29,167
Is it true that you keep in contact

431
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:30,934
with the Backovic estate?

432
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:34,051
I've got a number
I've called a few times.

433
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:37,217
I've managed to pry a few items loose.

434
00:31:37,317 --> 00:31:41,068
Backovic's widow can be
difficult to deal with.

435
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:44,884
I admire a man like Backovic:

436
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:48,618
unafraid to transgress,

437
00:31:48,718 --> 00:31:52,168
in life and in art.

438
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,284
You see,

439
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:59,851
I've always wanted to make my own films.

440
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,068
But I detest the falseness of Hollywood.

441
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:06,707
I would rather die
than make something false.

442
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:07,233
[click]

443
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,967
Don't you agree?

444
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,101
Yeah. Sure.

445
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:49,884
[gasps]

446
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:52,217
Don't leave, Mr. Sweetman.

447
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:54,734
There's so much more
for us to talk about.

448
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,861
What is it that you Americans say, huh?

449
00:32:58,961 --> 00:32:59,467
[panting]

450
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:01,584
"Relax."

451
00:33:01,684 --> 00:33:03,701
"Chill out."

452
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:09,567
[projector running]

453
00:33:17,068 --> 00:33:20,985
The blade of a splicing table
can be used to create a lie

454
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:24,818
or to tell the truth.

455
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:28,284
It all depends whose hand it's in.

456
00:33:28,384 --> 00:33:31,751
This may be larger than
a natural splicing blade,

457
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:34,217
but you get the point.

458
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:35,567
[woman gasps]

459
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,951
I believe in truth.

460
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:46,534
[gasping]

461
00:33:58,867 --> 00:33:59,951
One take.

462
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:03,351
One, uninterrupted shot.

463
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:05,081
The only cut was to her.

464
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:05,551
[thud]

465
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:07,634
[knife clatters]

466
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:13,184
I turned her into art.

467
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,174
Something happens when
you point the camera

468
00:34:16,274 --> 00:34:17,716
at something terrible.

469
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:20,834
The resulting film takes on power.

470
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:26,517
No, it doesn't!
Cinema isn't powerful.

471
00:34:26,617 --> 00:34:28,584
It doesn't reveal some hidden truth.

472
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:30,034
It's just fuckin' murder!

473
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,834
[pants]

474
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:38,618
You're not listening to me,
my friend.

475
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:44,051
You come all this way,
then you don't listen.

476
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:47,531
You want to understand why
La Fin Absolue du Monde

477
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:49,471
tore through the audiences.

478
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:53,684
Backovic was an exceptional editor.

479
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:57,951
He understood the value of a cut.

480
00:34:58,051 --> 00:35:01,085
But there was more to it.

481
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:05,551
They say the movie works
subliminally as you're watching.

482
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:10,384
But the thing that made
the film a weapon:

483
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:12,784
blood.

484
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:15,267
Spilt blood.

485
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:21,584
What if you got hold of an angel,

486
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:25,786
a divine being with the blood
of gold flowing through

487
00:35:25,886 --> 00:35:26,618
its veins?

488
00:35:26,718 --> 00:35:31,001
And what if you sacrificed it...
on camera?

489
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:36,517
Something that profound,

490
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:37,751
that personal--

491
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:42,217
it changes everyone who was part
of putting it on film

492
00:35:42,317 --> 00:35:43,851
and everyone who sees it.

493
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:46,985
The closer you get to the film,

494
00:35:47,085 --> 00:35:50,085
the more you'll be changed too.

495
00:35:50,185 --> 00:35:53,400
This was Backovic's secret.

496
00:35:54,867 --> 00:35:57,818
"Film is magic," he said.

497
00:35:57,918 --> 00:35:59,500
And he was right.

498
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,168
[gasps] What is it you see?

499
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:07,818
Who is it who wants you?

500
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:11,018
Who will be waiting for you
on the other side?

501
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:11,838
[explosion]

502
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,751
Fuck you.

503
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:33,018
Fuck me? Fuck me?
Huh?

504
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:34,184
Fuck you, psycho!

505
00:36:34,284 --> 00:36:36,445
[grunts] Tell me where

506
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:37,684
the film is.

507
00:36:37,784 --> 00:36:40,451
Tell me who to talk to!
No!

508
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:41,618
You have the film?

509
00:36:41,718 --> 00:36:44,701
[gasping] Katja!

510
00:37:02,701 --> 00:37:04,634
[pants]

511
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:20,367
Ah, bonjour. Can you connect me
to Air France, s'il vous plait?

512
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,051
[rings] [clears throat]

513
00:37:40,151 --> 00:37:42,055
[woman] Yes?
Miss Backovic, can I speak

514
00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:43,133
to you for a minute?

515
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:44,951
I've come a long way.

516
00:37:45,051 --> 00:37:46,901
[door buzzer]

517
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:07,168
Are you my sweet man, Kirby?

518
00:38:09,168 --> 00:38:12,200
Will you take care of me always?

519
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:20,300
You're not real.

520
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,101
[elevator dings]

521
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:37,567
[door closes]

522
00:38:47,767 --> 00:38:51,517
You saw something that
upset you. In the elevator?

523
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:53,985
You could say that.
Yet now you are here.

524
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:57,389
You must want this very badly.
You're the first to make it

525
00:38:57,489 --> 00:38:57,968
this far.

526
00:38:58,068 --> 00:39:02,217
I didn't expect you to be here.
I thought you'd be in Europe.

527
00:39:02,317 --> 00:39:05,117
This is still very much his
house. He's in every room.

528
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:08,551
Hans moved us here because
he thought it would become

529
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:09,968
a place to make films

530
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:12,684
more affordably than Hollywood could.

531
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,417
20 years later, he's right.

532
00:39:14,517 --> 00:39:17,018
I have so many questions.

533
00:39:17,118 --> 00:39:20,618
I'm not sure I have
the answers you're looking for.

534
00:39:20,718 --> 00:39:23,284
But we'll see.

535
00:39:23,384 --> 00:39:26,554
Do you have a print of
La Fin Absolue du Monde?

536
00:39:26,654 --> 00:39:28,327
That's not what you want.

537
00:39:28,427 --> 00:39:32,394
You want to know if the stories
about the film are true.

538
00:39:32,494 --> 00:39:33,101
Are they?

539
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,001
Yes. Unfortunately.

540
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:40,402
Why are you looking for the film?

541
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:41,534
I'm being paid to.

542
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:43,684
[laughing] That is just an excuse.

543
00:39:43,784 --> 00:39:45,951
If someone paid you
to kill a man, would you?

544
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,384
No, of course not.

545
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:50,384
But you have been warned about this.

546
00:39:50,484 --> 00:39:53,517
La Fin Absolue du Monde
is no ordinary film.

547
00:39:53,617 --> 00:39:56,235
That's what everyone keeps
telling me, like I'm going

548
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:57,567
to back off or something.

549
00:39:57,667 --> 00:40:01,117
I don't want to see an ordinary
film. I want to see

550
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:02,847
something extraordinary.

551
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:06,051
You sound exactly like Hans.

552
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:10,184
He would do anything
to make his films stand out.

553
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:14,051
Who produced the film?
You're very direct.

554
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:15,734
I just wanna hear somebody say it.

555
00:40:17,233 --> 00:40:21,051
I asked Hans the same question,
many times.

556
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:24,818
"The producers of this film
produce many other things:

557
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:28,168
chaos, sorrow,
suffering, famine."

558
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,217
What does that mean?
The devil?

559
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:34,451
Hans never put a name on it.

560
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:39,001
"Evil is evil," he would say.
"Does a name really matter?"

561
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:43,250
Come with me.

562
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,300
I have something to show you.

563
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,884
This is nice.

564
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:06,718
He kept it all state of the art
until the year he died.

565
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:10,134
How did he die? There was
no official obituary.

566
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:19,417
Hans...became obsessed with
La Fin Absolue du Monde.

567
00:41:19,517 --> 00:41:22,085
During the last year of his life,

568
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:24,284
all he did was watch it,

569
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:25,634
like a punishment.

570
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:30,384
In the end,
he got too close to the fire.

571
00:41:30,484 --> 00:41:35,751
The film was too effective.

572
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:39,818
It, um-- It got inside him.

573
00:41:39,918 --> 00:41:41,901
It made him crazy.

574
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:49,317
He stopped by the kitchen
on the way to find me...

575
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:51,484
in the bedroom.

576
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:53,151
He meant to kill us both.

577
00:41:53,251 --> 00:41:55,701
But when he cut my throat...

578
00:41:58,134 --> 00:41:59,618
he only disfigured me.

579
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,367
When he cut his own throat...

580
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:05,434
he died.

581
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,534
I'm not sure I got the better deal.

582
00:42:09,934 --> 00:42:14,451
I was left to take care of
La Fin Absolue du Monde.

583
00:42:14,551 --> 00:42:18,484
I hate that film.
And I understand its power.

584
00:42:18,584 --> 00:42:21,101
I wish it had never been made.

585
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:26,284
Do you understand
what that's like, Kirby?

586
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:30,206
Wanting to do penance
for something but knowing

587
00:42:30,306 --> 00:42:31,417
it's too late.

588
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:34,701
[panting]

589
00:42:37,101 --> 00:42:38,884
Yeah.

590
00:42:38,984 --> 00:42:40,184
I do.

591
00:42:40,284 --> 00:42:44,618
People said terrible things about Hans.

592
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:49,184
Some people said he deserved his death.

593
00:42:49,284 --> 00:42:51,551
[quietly] Maybe he did.

594
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:54,300
But I miss him...terribly.

595
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,151
Miss Backovic-- Oh...Katja.

596
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:02,918
Katja...um...

597
00:43:03,018 --> 00:43:04,600
can I watch the film?

598
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,001
I put it here.

599
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:18,168
I hate even having it in the house.

600
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,484
Ever since I've been tracking
this, I've been seeing flashes.

601
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:26,315
Circles with images inside of 'em.

602
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:27,985
The cigarette burns?

603
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:30,985
Yeah. And every time
I see them, something--

604
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:33,534
Terrible things happen.
When did they start?

605
00:43:35,001 --> 00:43:37,517
I have a tape of an interview with Hans.

606
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:40,200
Ever since I heard his voice--
You were marked.

607
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,085
That's how potent
La Fin Absolue du Monde is.

608
00:43:46,185 --> 00:43:48,818
It doesn't just effect you
when you're watching it.

609
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,351
As soon as you start getting close to it,

610
00:43:51,451 --> 00:43:56,718
it rubs off on you, like
you're stepping into quicksand.

611
00:43:56,818 --> 00:43:59,233
So go ahead,
take the film.

612
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:02,200
It's already too late.

613
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:54,117
[moans]

614
00:44:54,217 --> 00:44:56,200
I can feel it.

615
00:45:01,467 --> 00:45:03,634
It's worth every penny.

616
00:45:35,634 --> 00:45:37,567
[sighs]

617
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:56,367
[gasps, exhales]

618
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,701
[button clicks]

619
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,233
[projector running]

620
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,517
[cork pops]

621
00:46:44,617 --> 00:46:47,233
[ghostly whispers]

622
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:22,567
Fuck!

623
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,068
[cell phone dialing]

624
00:47:27,233 --> 00:47:29,651
Timpson, yeah,
I just got back.

625
00:47:29,751 --> 00:47:31,801
I'm standing in front
of the theater right now.

626
00:47:31,901 --> 00:47:32,901
Where the fuck are you?

627
00:47:33,001 --> 00:47:36,143
You were here?
When did he put the chains on?

628
00:47:36,243 --> 00:47:37,918
He said I had two weeks.

629
00:47:38,018 --> 00:47:39,839
All right, all right.
Relax, relax.

630
00:47:39,939 --> 00:47:40,934
I've got the money.

631
00:47:41,034 --> 00:47:43,324
We'll be back in business by tomorrow.

632
00:47:43,424 --> 00:47:44,667
I'll take care of it.

633
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:47,217
Yeah, I'm fuckin' pissed!

634
00:47:47,317 --> 00:47:50,134
No, man, I'm not pissed at you.
All right. Bye.

635
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,200
[cell rings]

636
00:47:55,034 --> 00:47:57,250
Hello?

637
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,217
Bellinger?

638
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:01,951
Yeah, but wai-wai-wait.
What happened?

639
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:03,701
All right.
I'm coming right now.

640
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:36,001
Mr. Bellinger!
Mr. Bellinger!

641
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:41,088
Mr. Bellinger called me.
You brought the film

642
00:48:41,188 --> 00:48:42,151
to this house!

643
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:45,561
I don't want any trouble.
But you brought trouble

644
00:48:45,661 --> 00:48:47,431
to this house, didn't you?

645
00:48:48,068 --> 00:48:49,484
And now you're back.

646
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:50,867
Hell...

647
00:48:52,068 --> 00:48:56,151
I know what you want.
You want to see the movie.

648
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:59,018
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

649
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:02,184
I hope you get what you want,

650
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:04,451
what you deserve!

651
00:49:04,551 --> 00:49:05,467
[screams]

652
00:49:13,267 --> 00:49:14,467
[screams]

653
00:49:23,867 --> 00:49:26,134
[indistinct whispers]

654
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,684
[gasps]

655
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:54,168
[grunts]

656
00:49:55,233 --> 00:49:57,818
[groans] Bellinger?

657
00:49:57,918 --> 00:50:00,600
[coughs, gasps]

658
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:05,884
You missed the good part.
What's goin' on?

659
00:50:05,984 --> 00:50:07,667
[pants]

660
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:13,001
Oh, nothing.
And everything is all right.

661
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,500
You sure? Maybe I should call a doctor?

662
00:50:18,834 --> 00:50:24,051
I have done terrible things in my life.

663
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:26,901
You don't make as much money as I have...

664
00:50:29,101 --> 00:50:30,934
without burying a few bodies.

665
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:34,018
[grunts]

666
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:36,667
You only can sleep at night...

667
00:50:38,267 --> 00:50:40,034
if they stay buried.

668
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:42,967
They never do.

669
00:50:44,233 --> 00:50:45,985
You watched La Fin Absolue du Monde?

670
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,184
Yeah.

671
00:50:48,284 --> 00:50:52,184
[gasping] I highly recommend it.

672
00:50:52,284 --> 00:50:57,451
[straining] It's...not a movie, however.

673
00:50:57,551 --> 00:50:59,951
It's a preview.

674
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:04,500
It's coming attractions of the soul.

675
00:51:07,001 --> 00:51:08,134
But it has...

676
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:13,801
[chuckles] a hell of an ending.

677
00:51:15,168 --> 00:51:18,317
You said on the phone you needed help.

678
00:51:18,417 --> 00:51:20,351
I...was going to ask you

679
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:24,117
to find another movie for me.

680
00:51:24,217 --> 00:51:27,634
After all, you did
a good job with this one.

681
00:51:29,901 --> 00:51:31,534
I don't need it anymore.

682
00:51:33,367 --> 00:51:37,034
I have been...inspired.

683
00:51:38,934 --> 00:51:42,801
[gasps] I made my own movie.

684
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:47,467
[gushing sounds]

685
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,701
[gagging]

686
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,718
Jesus, what are you doing?
What's going on here?

687
00:52:27,818 --> 00:52:31,250
What filthy, fuckin' thing--
What is this?

688
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,484
You don't wanna be here now!
You're right.

689
00:52:33,584 --> 00:52:35,632
Lately I've been spending
a lot of time doing things

690
00:52:35,732 --> 00:52:36,834
I never would have expected.

691
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:39,999
Like sitting outside your
theater for days at a time,

692
00:52:40,099 --> 00:52:41,068
with a loaded gun

693
00:52:41,168 --> 00:52:44,447
or letting my business go
to hell while I figure out ways

694
00:52:44,547 --> 00:52:45,567
to ruin your life.

695
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,985
I didn't want to throw my life away.

696
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:51,918
But now, if you get shot here,

697
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:54,484
what's it matter,
who's going to notice?

698
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:58,875
Just one more freak
on a stack of bodies tomorrow.

699
00:52:58,975 --> 00:52:59,618
[laughs]

700
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,200
Hey!
[grunts, groans]

701
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,101
[explosion]

702
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:09,168
[gasping]

703
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,168
Annie, baby!
Daddy?

704
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,384
Hush, hush.
Daddy's here.

705
00:55:02,484 --> 00:55:04,618
Everything's gonna be fine.

706
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,138
Daddy?
I'm right here.

707
00:55:06,238 --> 00:55:07,238
I'm right here.

708
00:55:09,034 --> 00:55:11,184
I'm so cold.

709
00:55:11,284 --> 00:55:13,884
[whimpers] Everything's fine.

710
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:15,467
I'll get you out of here.

711
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:19,417
Daddy?
[stammers]

712
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,718
I'm sorry, honey.

713
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,317
Everything will be okay now, okay?

714
00:55:24,417 --> 00:55:27,233
I'm-- I'm hungry.

715
00:55:28,834 --> 00:55:29,784
[screams]

716
00:55:29,884 --> 00:55:31,267
[screams, gasps]

717
00:55:43,734 --> 00:55:46,701
I see now.
I understand.

718
00:55:47,834 --> 00:55:49,651
Annie?

719
00:55:49,751 --> 00:55:52,184
What's happening?
She was just here!

720
00:55:52,284 --> 00:55:55,651
Of course she was,
'cause you won't let her go.

721
00:55:55,751 --> 00:55:57,851
I loved her.

722
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,951
I loved her too!
But I see now,

723
00:56:01,051 --> 00:56:03,284
that we can't both let her go.

724
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:05,451
It's like we're killing her
over and over again.

725
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:08,651
[gasping] And we'll never let her go.

726
00:56:08,751 --> 00:56:11,751
Not until we're both dead.

727
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:13,300
[groans]

728
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,951
[blood gushes]

729
00:56:17,051 --> 00:56:20,701
[panting] Here's your fucking money.

730
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:43,134
[whimpering] I love you. I'm sorry.

731
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:45,985
[explosion]

732
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:47,767
[gunshot]

733
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:22,101
Thank you...for this.
