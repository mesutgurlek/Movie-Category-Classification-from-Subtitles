CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
WARNER BROS.

2
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,964
HA HA HA HA!

3
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:14,250
Helga: WHEN YOUR FATHER
WAS A BOY LIKE YOU

4
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,753
AND LIVING WITH ME
HERE IN NORWAY,

5
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:19,255
I TOLD HIM
ABOUT WITCHES, TOO,

6
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:22,258
SO THAT HE WOULD
ALWAYS BE AWARE.

7
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:24,260
NOW, THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING

8
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,264
YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
REAL WITCHES IS THIS--

9
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:29,766
NOW LISTEN
VERY CAREFULLY.

10
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:33,269
REAL WITCHES DRESS
IN ORDINARY CLOTHES

11
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,272
AND LOOK VERY MUCH
LIKE ORDINARY WOMEN.

12
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:38,775
THEY LIVE
IN ORDINARY HOUSES,

13
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:42,779
AND THEY WORK
IN ORDINARY JOBS.

14
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:48,785
EVERY COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD HAS WITCHES.

15
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:51,788
AND THERE IS A LEADER,

16
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:53,289
A HIGH WITCH,

17
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,791
OF EACH COUNTRY.

18
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:59,295
AND THE RULER
OF ALL THE WITCHES

19
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:03,299
IS THE MOST EVIL WOMAN
IN CREATION--

20
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,803
THE GRAND HIGH WITCH...

21
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:08,304
HERSELF.

22
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,311
WITCHES SPEND
THEIR TIME

23
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,313
PLOTTING
TO KILL CHILDREN,

24
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:18,815
STALKING
THE WRETCHED CHILD

25
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:23,319
LIKE A HUNTER STALKS
A BIRD IN THE FOREST.

26
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,821
DID THEY HUNT YOU?

27
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:32,328
YOU SAID
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

28
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:35,832
A VERY UNPLEASANT
ACCIDENT.

29
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:37,834
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

30
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:42,338
I TRAVELED THE WORLD IN SEARCH
FOR THE GRAND HIGH WITCH,

31
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:44,340
BUT I NEVER FOUND HER.

32
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,842
I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE

33
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:48,845
THAT ANYONE
HAS EVER FOUND HER.

34
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,848
SO IF NO ONE'S SEEN
THE GRAND HIGH WITCH,

35
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:53,850
HOW ARE YOU SURE
SHE EXISTS?

36
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,351
NOBODY'S EVER SEEN
THE DEVIL,

37
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,353
BUT WE KNOW HE EXISTS,
DON'T WE?

38
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:58,354
YEAH.

39
00:03:58,354 --> 00:03:59,856
FOR ALL YOU KNOW,

40
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:03,359
A WITCH MIGHT BE LIVING
NEXT DOOR TO YOU.

41
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,862
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

42
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:09,365
I LIVED BESIDE A GIRL
CALLED ERICA,

43
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:11,367
WHO WAS TAKEN
BY A WITCH.

44
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:14,370
ERICA HAD VERY
STRICT PARENTS.

45
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,373
BUT EVEN THAT
DIDN'T SAVE POOR ERICA,

46
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:19,876
BECAUSE WHEN A WITCH
CHOOSES A VICTIM,

47
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:22,879
THERE IS ONLY
ONE HOPE OF ESCAPE--

48
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,882
KNOWING EVERYTHING
ABOUT THEM

49
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,884
THAT I AM TELLING YOU.

50
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,385
I'M WARNING YOU.

51
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:32,388
ERICA, COME IN.

52
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:33,890
WHAT MAKES HER
DANGEROUS

53
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,893
IS THE FACT THAT SHE
DOESN'T LOOK DANGEROUS.

54
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,394
YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE

55
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:41,397
IF IT'S A WITCH
YOU ARE LOOKING AT

56
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:42,899
OR A KIND LADY.

57
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:43,900
[RIBBET]

58
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,287
AH, ERICA.

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,790
HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY NEW PAINTING?

60
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
IT'SMAGNIFIQUE,
PAPA.

61
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,794
GO TO LARSEN'S

62
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,296
AND BUY...

63
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,798
A LITER OF MILK.
HMM?

64
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
JA,PAPA.

65
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,304
COME STRAIGHT HOME.

66
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,805
JA,DA.

67
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,309
REAL WITCHES
HATE CHILDREN.

68
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,816
REAL WITCHES
ARE QUITE BALD,

69
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,818
ALTHOUGH, OF COURSE,
THEY WEAR WIGS...

70
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,820
THAT ITCH...

71
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,822
AND CAUSE THEM
SCALP RASH.

72
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,325
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SCALP RASH IS?

73
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,826
NO.

74
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,828
ITCHING UNDER THE WIG.

75
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,331
IT MUST DRIVE THEM CRAZY.

76
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,334
THEY LOOK QUITE HIDEOUS

77
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,337
BEHIND THEIR HUMAN
FACE MASKS

78
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,840
AND CAN ONLY BE DISTINGUISHED
FROM ORDINARY WOMEN

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,842
IF YOU ARE SHARP ENOUGH

80
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,346
TO SPOT THE PURPLE TINGE
TO THEIR EYES.

81
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:51,351
REAL WITCHES
HAVE NO TOES.

82
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,853
THEIR FEET
HAVE SQUARE ENDS,

83
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,357
REVOLTING STUMPS WHERE
THEIR TOES SHOULD BE,

84
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,361
SO THEY NEVER WEAR
POINTED OR PRETTY SHOES,

85
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,364
JUST PLAIN,
SENSIBLE SHOES.

86
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:09,369
REMEMBER THESE THINGS.

87
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,373
PERHAPS IF ERICA
HAD KNOWN THEM...

88
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,875
[MEOW]

89
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,383
[MEOW]

90
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,886
HA HA!

91
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,888
Helga: OH, MY POOR ERICA.

92
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,891
FOR WEEKS
THEY SEARCHED,

93
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,394
BUT WITCHES
DON'T MURDER CHILDREN

94
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,396
WITH KNIVES OR GUNS.

95
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,399
THAT'S FOR PEOPLE
WHO GET CAUGHT,

96
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,901
AND WITCHES
NEVER GET CAUGHT.

97
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,905
THEY SEARCHED
FOR MILES AROUND.

98
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,908
EVERYONE IN THE TOWN
SEARCHED,

99
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,912
BUT SHE HAD COMPLETELY
DISAPPEARED.

100
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,423
I WAS THERE IN ERICA'S HOUSE
SIX WEEKS LATER.

101
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,924
GOOD DAY,
FRAU LARSEN.

102
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,427
COME IN, HELGA.
HAVE SOME CAKE.

103
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,930
Helga: I WAS HER BEST FRIEND
WHEN IT ALL HAPPENED.

104
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,933
THEN THAT DAY,

105
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,936
WHILE ERICA'S MOTHER
WAS POURING THE COFFEE,

106
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,939
HER FATHER CAME
WALKING TOWARDS US.

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,443
IT WAS AS THOUGH
HE HAD SEEN A GHOST.

108
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
HIS FACE
WAS ALL TWISTED UP

109
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,448
AS HE WALKED TOWARDS
THE PAINTING BEHIND ME.

110
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:33,453
THERE, AS IF IT
ALWAYS HAD BEEN THERE,

111
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,955
WAS ERICA,

112
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,957
LOCKED
IN THE PAINTING,

113
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
GAZING AT US.

114
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,962
PAPA.

115
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,964
PAPA.

116
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

117
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,968
YOU SAW HER IN THE
PAINTING, GRANDMA?

118
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:49,969
MANY TIMES.

119
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,471
BUT THE PECULIAR THING

120
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,975
WAS THAT LITTLE ERICA KEPT ON
CHANGING HER POSITION

121
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
IN THE PICTURE.

122
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,480
SO ONE DAY SHE'D BE
FEEDING THE DUCKS,

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,982
THE NEXT DAY SHE'D BE
INSIDE THE FARMHUSE,

124
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
LOOKING OUT OF A WINDOW.

125
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,487
DID YOU SEE HER
MOVING IN THE PICTURE?

126
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,988
NOBODY DID.

127
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,991
SHE WAS ALWAYS
JUST A FIGURE

128
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,994
MOTIONLESS
IN THE PAINTING.

129
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,997
AS THE YEARS WENT BY,

130
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,999
ERICA GREW OLDER,
TOO.

131
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,504
AND ONLY
FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO,

132
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,507
THE OLD WOMAN
THAT ERICA HAD BECOME,

133
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,009
BENT AND FRAIL
IN THE PAINTING,

134
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,013
BEGAN TO DISAPPEAR.

135
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,517
UNTIL ONE MORNING,

136
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
SHE WAS GONE.

137
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,020
YOU MEAN SHE DIED?

138
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,522
WHO KNOWS?

139
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,475
MYSTERIOUS THINGS GO ON
IN THE WORLD OF WITCHES.

140
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:49,695
HEY,
IT'S ALMOST 9:00.

141
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,197
GRANDMA'S
BEEN TELLING ME

142
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,698
ABOUT WITCHES,
MOM.

143
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,202
AND FRIGHTENING YOU
BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP.

144
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,703
GOOD NIGHT,
DARLING.

145
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,205
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
MOTHER?

146
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,706
Helga:
VERY ALL RIGHT.

147
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,708
GO OFF. ENJOY
YOURSELVES.

148
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,210
GOODBYE,
MOM.

149
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,212
HERE YOU GO.

150
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,214
GOOD NIGHT, SON.

151
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,215
GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

152
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,716
NO MORE STORIES, OK?

153
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,220
OH, NO.

154
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,248
COME ON, GRANDMA.
JUST ONE MORE STORY.

155
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,250
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
ONE MORE.

156
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,252
BUT VERY SHORT.

157
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,255
WITCHES...

158
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,257
ARE VERY CRUEL.

159
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:56,262
AND THEY HAVE A HIGHLY-DEVELOPED
SENSE OF SMELL.

160
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,265
A REAL WITCH COULD SMELL YOU
ACROSS THE STREET

161
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,766
ON A PITCH-BLACK NIGHT.

162
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,769
SHE COULDN'T SMELL ME.
I JUST HAD A SHOWER.

163
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,271
OH, YES, SHE COULD.

164

THAT WAS BRUNO'S FATHER?

1160
01:01:53,826 --> 01:01:55,328
Ernst: WHAT A NASTY MAN.

1161
01:01:55,328 --> 01:01:58,331
IT'S AN ACT OF MERCY
ON MY PART.

1162
01:01:58,331 --> 01:02:01,834
THE CHILD WILL NEVER
BE LIKE THE FATHER.

1163
01:02:01,834 --> 01:02:02,835
THANKS.

1164
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:03,836
LIEBCHEN?

1165
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:06,839
LIEBCHEN?

1166
01:02:08,341 --> 01:02:09,342
LIEBCHEN?
LIPSHIN?

1167
01:02:09,342 --> 01:02:10,843
LIPSHIN?

1168
01:02:10,843 --> 01:02:12,345
LIEBCHEN?

1169
01:02:15,348 --> 01:02:16,349
LIEBCHEN.

1170
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:20,853
WAS IST DAS?

1171
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:22,355
OH.
I--I'M SO SORRY.

1172
01:02:22,355 --> 01:02:23,356
I DROPPED MY KNITTING.

1173
01:02:23,356 --> 01:02:24,857
YOU!

1174
01:02:24,857 --> 01:02:28,861
I'M...I--I'M, UH, KNITTING
SOMETHING FOR MY GRANDSON.

1175
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:30,863
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
BY ANY CHANCE?

1176
01:02:30,863 --> 01:02:31,864
NO, NO.

1177
01:02:31,864 --> 01:02:33,366
COME,LIEBCHEN.

1178
01:02:33,366 --> 01:02:35,368
I'M DREADFULLY SORRY.

1179
01:02:35,368 --> 01:02:36,869
I DO APOLOGIZE.

1180
01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:38,371
THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

1181
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:41,874
IF I SEE YOUR GRANDSON,
I WILL...

1182
01:02:43,376 --> 01:02:45,378
I WILL TURN HIM
INTO A MOUSE.

1183
01:02:45,378 --> 01:02:46,879
AND YOU,
MEDDLING OLD WOMAN,

1184
01:02:46,879 --> 01:02:48,381
I'LL DEAL WITH LATER.

1185
01:02:49,382 --> 01:02:50,383
LIEBCHEN.

1186
01:02:55,388 --> 01:02:57,890
I HOPE WE'RE NOT
THE FIRST.

1187
01:02:59,392 --> 01:03:01,394
MISS ERNST!

1188
01:03:01,394 --> 01:03:02,895
WHO IS THIS?

1189
01:03:02,895 --> 01:03:06,399
YOU TOLD THEM TO COME UP
AFTER THE DRINKS.

1190
01:03:06,399 --> 01:03:08,401
ALL RIGHT.
LET THEM IN.

1191
01:03:15,408 --> 01:03:16,409
COME IN.

1192
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:18,911
YOU WERE WNDERFUL
THIS AFTERNOON.

1193
01:03:22,915 --> 01:03:24,417
YOU BAD CAT,LIEBCHEN.

1194
01:03:24,417 --> 01:03:25,918
YOU'RE EARLY,
IN FACT.

1195
01:03:26,419 --> 01:03:27,920
[MEOW]

1196
01:03:40,933 --> 01:03:43,936
Man: WHEN DO YOU THINK
THEY'D IMPLEMENT IT?

1197
01:03:43,936 --> 01:03:45,938
Second man: FIRST OF
THE YEAR, I SUPPOSE.

1198
01:03:45,938 --> 01:03:48,441
SHE'S A VERY PLEASANT
WOMAN.

1199
01:03:48,441 --> 01:03:49,942
YES. NOW,
THE QUESTION IS,

1200
01:03:49,942 --> 01:03:51,444
WOULD SHE LIKE
TO WORK WITH US?

1201
01:03:51,444 --> 01:03:53,446
Luke: OW! OH...

1202
01:03:59,452 --> 01:04:00,953
WHEW!

1203
01:04:11,464 --> 01:04:13,466
GRANDMA, GRANDMA!
I'VE GOT IT!

1204
01:04:13,466 --> 01:04:14,967
I'VE GOT THE FORMULA.

1205
01:04:14,967 --> 01:04:16,969
OH, THANK GOD.

1206
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:18,971
LUKE, DARLING,
I WAS SO WORRIED.

1207
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:21,974
THERE'S 500 DOSES
IN THIS ONE LITTLE BOTTLE.

1208
01:04:22,475 --> 01:04:24,477
IT'S ENOUGH TO CHANGE
ALL THE WITCHES

1209
01:04:24,477 --> 01:04:25,478
IN THIS HOTEL.

1210
01:04:25,478 --> 01:04:27,480
WHERE'S BRUNO?

1211
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:30,983
THERE'S SOME JOLLY GOOD
GRAPES HERE.

1212
01:04:30,983 --> 01:04:32,485
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

1213
01:04:32,485 --> 01:04:34,487
NOTHING UNTIL DINNERTIME.

1214
01:04:34,487 --> 01:04:37,490
NOW, WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU
BACK TO YOUR PARENTS.

1215
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:38,991
WHAT TIME IS IT?

1216
01:04:39,492 --> 01:04:39,992
7:00.

1217
01:04:40,493 --> 01:04:41,994
THEY'LL BE IN THE BAR.

1218
01:04:41,994 --> 01:04:45,998
A SHERRY AND A LARGE
MALT WHISKEY AT 7:00 SHARP.

1219
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:48,000
IT GIVES YOU
AN APPETITE.

1220
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,502
DOES IT?

1221
01:04:49,502 --> 01:04:51,003
COME ON.

1222
01:04:51,003 --> 01:04:54,507
INTO MY HANDBAG,
BOTH OF YOU.

1223
01:04:54,507 --> 01:04:57,510
THIS IS GOING
TO BE DIFFICULT.

1224
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:59,011
OH, I'M FULL.

1225
01:04:59,011 --> 01:05:01,514
Luke: WE'VE GOT TO GET
TO THE KITCHEN QUICKLY.

1226
01:05:02,014 --> 01:05:04,016
Bruno: HA HA HA.
THAT TICKLES.

1227
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,904
IS THAT THEM?

1228
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,405
Luke: YES.
LISTEN, GRANDMA.

1229
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,907
MAYBE WE
OUGHT TO--

1230
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,408
SHH.

1231
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,910
WAIT! LISTEN...

1232
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,414
DON'T DROWN IT.

1233
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,415
OH, SORRY.

1234
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,417
NOW LOOK WHAT
YOU'VE DONE!

1235
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:22,919
SHE WAS DROWNING IT.

1236
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,421
ARE YOU MR.
AND MRS. JENKINS?

1237
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,925
HOLE IN ONE.
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?

1238
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,927
I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU

1239
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:33,429
ABOUT YOUR SON.

1240
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:34,931
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

1241
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:38,434
NOW, WHAT'S THE LITTLE
TYKE BEEN UP TO NOW?

1242
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:40,937
RAIDING THE KITCHEN,
I SUPPOSE.

1243
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:45,441
IF WE COULD GO SOMEWHERE
MORE PRIVATE...

1244
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,943
PRIVATE?

1245
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,946
WELL, IT IS
RATHER A...

1246
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,447
PERSONAL MATTER.

1247
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,950
LOOK, MRS. WHATEVER
YOUR NAME IS,

1248
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,954
IF BRUNO HAS BROKEN A WINDOW
OR SMASHED YOUR SPECTACLES,

1249
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,957
I'LL PAY FOR IT,
BUT WE'RE NOT BUDGING.

1250
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,959
WE ALWAYS SIT
AT THIS TABLE.

1251
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:06,462
WHERE IS BRUNO?
TELL HIM TO COME SEE ME.

1252
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,965
HE IS HERE ALREADY.

1253
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:09,966
WHAT?

1254
01:06:09,966 -- 01:06:12,468
IN MY HANDBAG.

1255
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:16,472
YOUR SON HAS
SUFFERED A MISHAP.

1256
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:20,476
HE HAS BEEN
DRASTICALLY ALTERED.

1257
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,979
ALTERED? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, ALTERED?

1258
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,983
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE.

1259
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:30,486
MY GRANDSON SAW THEM
DOING IT TO HIM.

1260
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,989
SAW WHO DOING WHAT?

1261
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:39,495
SAW THE WITCHES TURN
HIM INTO A MOUSE.

1262
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,999
ARE YOU CRACKERS?

1263
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,002
GET THE MANAGER, DEAR.

1264
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,005
TELL THEM TO THROW THIS
NUTCASE OUT OF THE HOTEL.

1265
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,007
YOU NEED A FUNNY FARM.

1266
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:55,011
TELL THEM, BRUNO.

1267
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:57,013
AAH! IT'S A MOUSE!

1268
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,014
SHH!

1269
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,516
I CAN'T STAND THEM!
GET THEM AWAY!

1270
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,019
IT IS BRUNO.
TELL THEM, BRUNO.

1271
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,521
GET OUT OF HERE!
HOW DARE YOU!

1272
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,024
COME ON.
TELL THEM, BRUNO.

1273
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,025
AAH!

1274
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:12,028
IT'S ME, MUM. I--

1275
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,530
OUT BEFORE I CALL
THE POLICE,

1276
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:18,534
YOU BARMY OLD LOONEY.
JUST GO ON! PUSH OFF!

1277
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:21,537
NEVER COME BACK,
YOU STUPID OLD WITCH!

1278
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,539
I DID MY BEST,
BRUNO.

1279
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,725
DON'T WORRY, DEAR.
JUST GO ON.

1280
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,210
EVENING, MADAM.

1281
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,713
JUST POPPING IN TO
TURN DOWN YOUR BED.

1282
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,715
HOW IS
THE ROOM SERVICE HERE?

1283
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:33,716
DIABOLICAL.

1284
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,718
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT WOMAN UPSTAIRS?

1285
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,721
WALK DOWNSTAIRS.
THE ELEVATOR IS OUT OF ORDER.

1286
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,722
IS IT?

1287
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,223
MUST BE.

1288
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,225
IT'S A FIVE-COURSE MEAL.

1289
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,727
GOOD.
I'M RATHER HUNGRY.

1290
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:20,763
MMM.

1291
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,270
OH...

1292
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,280
MMM.

1293
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:04,557
I'D LIKE TO GO HOME,
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE.

1294
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,058
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

1295
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,560
THE BANQUET.

1296
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,063
NO! YOU MUST GO TO YOUR ROOM
AND PREPARE FOR--

1297
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,064
HELLO!

1298
01:09:12,064 --> 01:09:14,567
FOR TOMORROW'S FLIGHT.
YES, HAVE A GOOD FLIGHT.

1299
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,068
BUT IT'S
OUR BANQUET.

1300
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:18,571
YOU ARE NOT HERE
TO ENJOY YOURSELF,

1301
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,573
YOU ARE HERE
AS MY STAFF.

1302
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,575
GO TO YOUR ROOM NOW.

1303
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,577
LADIES.

1304
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,581
I QUIT!

1305
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:43,596
I CAN'T GO
THROUGH WITH IT.

1306
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:45,097
WE COULD GO HOME.

1307
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,099
Luke: GRANDMA,
IF WE DON'T TRY,

1308
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,602
EVERY MOTHER AND
FATHER IN ENGLAND

1309
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:52,104
WILL LOSE
THEIR KIDS.

1310
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:53,105
I KNOW.

1311
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:55,107
WE MUST DO IT,
GRANDMA.

1312
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:57,610
8:03 NOW.
8:15 EXACTLY.

1313
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,611
I'LL REMEMBER.

1314
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,613
LUKE, DARLING,
I'M SO TERRIFIED.

1315
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,615
GRANDMA, NOW!

1316
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,119
NO, NO, NO, MADME.

1317
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:10,122
THE DINING ROOM IS
DOWN THE CORRIDOR.
