She'll come soon,
but let's go inside now.

4

What are we gonna do,
Dahlia?

5
00:00:56,188 --> 00:01:00,090
What are we gonna do about your
mother always being so late?

6
00:01:31,757 --> 00:01:34,458
Hi.
Hi.

7
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:39,096
Did you ring?

8
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:43,434
It's not 11.
You didn't ring.

9
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:55,746
Good. You're early.
You can come right in.

<i>the rents were out of sight,
so we only took a one-year lease.</i>

And when my wife
asked me to leave,

14
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:07,007
I got a small one-bedroom
in Jersey City that's cheap.

15
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:09,309
How much?
800.

16

Where will Cecilia sleep
then?

17
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,580
There's a pullout couch
in the living room,

18
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:15,249
so when she comes to stay
with me, I'll sleep there.

Where?

23
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,096
Where?
Yeah, I told you, I'm moving to Jersey City.

24
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:30,330
There's a school there--
it's great.

25
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:33,017

places to rent, so...

26

make the shared custody easier.

No. No, I didn't.
No?

32
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:47,915
No, I didn't. The plane
was stuck on the tarmac,

33
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,383
and we didn't have a gate.

34

I told you a million times,
the phones didn't work.

You live in a world of your own.

I make one mistake,
and I don't care about Ceci?

39

Just a different part of the city.

you can't stop some of it from
coming down that elevator shaft.

155
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:54,824
There's just no way to stop it.
Anyway, here's 9F down here.

156
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:58,128
The building was built in 1976
by Stern-Jackson and associates,

157
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,430
in the brutalist style.

158
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,499
Um... Now, what they were
trying to create,

159
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,834
as you can see,
was kind of a little village,

160
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,170
kind of a Utopia, actually,
is what they had in mind.

161
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:09,572
And some of those ideas
have come together.

162
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:13,143
Some of their original plans for
the place were a little crazy,

163
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,412
if you ask me.

164
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,547
Hello.

165
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:20,117
Yeah, I just do that
just in case. It's vacant.

166
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,851
Come on in.
Shall I close this?

167
00:10:21,853 --> 00:10:25,088
Yeah. Let me just apologize in advance.
The place is in a little bit of a mess.

168
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,656
Our last tenant
was a little messy,

169
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:29,659
but we're gonna put a fresh new
coat of paint on this whole place.

170
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,194
It's gonna brighten it up
quite a bit.

171
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,063
Let's take a look
at your bedroom, sweetie.

172
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,832
This could be your room
if Mommy wants it to be.

173
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:39,636
What do you think? Isn't that great?
There's no air in here.

174
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:43,073
Of course there's air in here. If there
wasn't air, we wouldn't be able to breathe.

175
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:47,145
That window does not open, but it lets a
lot of natural light in in the afternoon.

176
00:10:47,171 --> 00:10:48,162
It's really great.

177
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,047
<i>DAHLIA: Strange.
MURRAY: I kinda like it.</i>

178
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,516
In the afternoon, it brightens
the place up quite a bit.

179
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,784
Anyway, here's the closet.

180
00:10:54,786 --> 00:10:56,302
You could put your dollies
in there

181
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:59,539
or, you know, Mom could use it
for storage.

182
00:11:02,476 --> 00:11:04,945
Lemme show you the bathroom. OK?
OK.

183
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:07,848
Come on, honey.
Is this another closet here?

184
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,900
Yeah, that's the foyer closet.

185
00:11:10,902 --> 00:11:13,236
The bathroom's pretty
self-explanatory.

186
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:15,538
It's in decent shape.
Once we clean it up.

187
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,841
You got the toilet, of course,
the sink, bathtub.

188
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,310
This glass is safety glass.

189
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:24,181
I mean, you could hit that as hard
as you want - it will not break.

190
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,016
And that is great for your
peace of mind, you know,

191
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,385
when Ceci's taking a bath
or what have you.

192
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,737
<i>DAHLIA: Hey, Ceci.
Come look in here.</i>

193
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:36,226
Ah, you're right. That's much better.
You can smell the river.

194
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,661
<i>Can you smell that?
DAHLIA: Yeah.</i>

195
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,963
Let me show you the other
bedroom here.

196
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,365
You know, it's tough to get
two bedrooms in Manhattan

197
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,702
or any of the boroughs,
for under a thousand dollars.

198
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,854
OK, that's a closet.
Scratch that.

199
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:52,225
That's a closet.
Um... Kitchen.

200
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:55,595
Got the refrigerator,
sink, stove,

201
00:11:55,597 --> 00:12:00,600
and this is kind of
a country eat-in dining room.

202
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:03,570
You see this. It's just really
smart how they did this.

203
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:06,406
See that little thing?
Boom - dining room.

204
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:08,642
You can put your stools around it
or whatever, and when you're done,

205
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,677
out of the way, no clutter.

206
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,014
The dishwasher, if you're entertaining,
very convenient to have.

207
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:17,283
Kitchen. OK.

208
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,920
And then here
is the other bedroom.

209
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:25,224
So, where's the living room?

210
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:26,844
Well, it's kind of
a living-room-slash-bedroom.

211
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,345
It's called a dual-use room.

212
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,347
You can see it's the size
of two rooms. It's huge.

213
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,050
Anyway, did you see the view?
Did you see that?

214
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,754
Look at that. That is a million-dollar
view for $900 a month.

215
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,856
I mean, I don't even
have that where I live.

216
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,509
You're not gonna do better
than that. I guarantee it.

217
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:13,073
Listen, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase here.

218
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,108
We could have this painted
this weekend.

219
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,410
You could move in on Monday,
and, you know,

220
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,045
we could just fill out
the forms right now.

221
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:22,499
I understand you want some time
to walk around, think about it.

222
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,601
Let me just check on Ceci.
Sure, sure. Yeah.

223
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,870
Ceci.

224
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,889
She's just making herself
at home. It's OK, Mom.

225
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,108
Ceci.

226
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,444
You know how they are.
She's just exploring.

227
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:58,285
Mr. Veeck. Mr. Veeck.

228
00:13:58,287 --> 00:14:00,487
Did my daughter come down here?
What?

229
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:01,889
My daughter.
The little girl that I came with.

230
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:03,837
The little girl.
Did she get on the elevator?

231
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:05,993
No. I see no one.
Just him.

232
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:09,263
Yeah, there was a little girl
in the stairwell.

233
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,535
Ceci.

234
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:20,657
Ceci.

235
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,867
Ceci.

236
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,504
Ceci. Are you in there?

237
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,172
<i>MURRAY: Hello?
Yeah?</i>

238
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:38,642
What are you doing down here?
I saw someone go in.

239
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,444
Did you check the stairs
all the way to the roof?

240
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:45,849
Ceci!

241
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:52,823
Look, Mommy. Hello Kitty.
I got a Hello Kitty bag.

242
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,457
Ceci. Ceci!

243
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,827
Don't you ever do that again!
Do you understand?

244
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:01,598
Don't you ever run away from me,
and you never come up on the roof.

245
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,233
Sorry.
Do you understand me?

246
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,236
It's not safe for you up here.
You could have fallen.

247
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,704
Sorry, Mommy.
OK?

248
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,807
How can you leave this unlocked?
There's no railing here.

249
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,175
It's totally irresponsible,

250
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:15,278
It's supposed to be locked.
Well, it wasn't.

251
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,147
Yeah. Sorry.

252
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,349
Are you OK, honey?
Yeah.

253
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,586
<i>[MURRAY SIGHS]</i>

255
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,326
You're so lucky
you found that.

256
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:34,314
My niece loves Hello Kitty.
Did you look inside it?

257
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:36,633
No. Mommy, can I look?
It's not yours, sweetie.

258
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,970
Oh, I'm sure she can keep it.
There's no other children in the building.

259
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,357
No children?
Why? It's so close to the school.

260
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,425
Oh, they all grew up.
You know, they're all teenagers now.

261
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:49,195
You know, hardly anybody ever
moves out 'cause of rent control.

262
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:51,197
Oh, there are other children
on the island.

263
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,832
You know,
in the other buildings.

264
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:55,035

So cute.

266
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,358
Mr. Veeck, why was the door
to the roof open?

267
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,627
What?
The roof.

268
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,995
My daughter found this
on the roof.

269
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:08,665
The roof? Where?
Just lying there.

270
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,969
Mr. Veeck. Why didn't you
lock the door to the roof?

271
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,553
I did.
No.

272
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,122
She opened it and walked right out.
Now, what if she'd gotten hurt?

273
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:19,092
That's negligence, Mr. Veeck,
and I'll call the union myself.

274
00:16:19,094 --> 00:16:21,561
You get fired for cause, and you
can kiss that pension goodbye.

275
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,663
What do you talk about?
I check it.

276
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:26,365
Hour ago, it was locked.
Someone else open it.

277
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,934
Well, whose bag is this?
What do I know?

278
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:32,422
Well, look inside it, please.
I'm so sorry about this.

bit of a communication problem.

to move here

you could move to Roosevelt Island,

Hi.

Uh, I'm sorry it's such a mess.
No, it's OK.

937
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:16,161
I just moved into a new office
and they've painted it.

938
01:04:16,163 --> 01:04:18,830
I can't stand the smell,
so I'm improvising.

939
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:20,598
OK.

Hi.
Hi.

941
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:34,879
So...
OK, um...

942
01:04:34,881 --> 01:04:38,083
Your husband's claiming
you're mentally unstable

943
01:04:38,085 --> 01:04:40,885
because your father
was physically abusive

944
01:04:40,887 --> 01:04:44,706
and your mother was an
alcoholic who abandoned you.

945
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:46,707
That's, uh...

946
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:51,045
unbelievable.

947
01:04:51,047 --> 01:04:53,398
What do my parents
have to do with this?

948
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,766
That's my question
exactly.

949
01:04:55,768 --> 01:04:57,852
What's more relevant is
that your husband says

950
01:04:57,854 --> 01:05:00,121
you suffer from
crippling migraines

951
01:05:00,123 --> 01:05:02,123
and paranoid delusions.

952
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:04,159
He says he'll submit
school reports

953
01:05:04,161 --> 01:05:07,545
that show your daughter is beginning
to share your fantasy life.

954
01:05:07,547 --> 01:05:09,547
"Cecilia is now having trouble
distinguishing

955
01:05:09,549 --> 01:05:11,616
between what is real
and what is not."

956
01:05:11,618 --> 01:05:14,085
It's a lie. It's a lie.

957
01:05:14,087 --> 01:05:16,654
In child custody briefs, it's standard
to make these kinds of accusations.

958
01:05:16,656 --> 01:05:19,991
Don't take it too seriously.
But I do need to know what,

959
01:05:19,993 --> 01:05:22,260
if anything,
in your husband's narrative

960
01:05:22,262 --> 01:05:25,680
has some semblance,
some shred of fact

961
01:05:25,682 --> 01:05:27,883
that he might produce
in court.

962
01:05:27,885 --> 01:05:32,169
Well, I get migraines.
Yeah, that's true.

963
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:36,524
But they've never interfered
with my ability to do anything.

964
01:05:36,526 --> 01:05:38,492
You can talk to my doctor
about that.

965
01:05:38,494 --> 01:05:42,146
He'll tell you they've
certainly never crippled me.

966
01:05:42,148 --> 01:05:43,748
Um...

967
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:48,887
As for Ceci, I think she's
a little bit lonely right now.

968
01:05:48,889 --> 01:05:50,454
Her father's abandoned her

969
01:05:50,456 --> 01:05:54,692
and she was forced to move
from her neighborhood, so...

970
01:05:54,694 --> 01:05:57,779
she's developed
an imaginary friend.

971
01:05:57,781 --> 01:06:00,414
But that's normal.

972
01:06:00,416 --> 01:06:03,802
That's fine.
But for future reference,

973
01:06:03,804 --> 01:06:06,204
when you're talking to,
for example, a judge,

974
01:06:06,206 --> 01:06:09,007
I would stay away from phrases like,
"her father's abandoned her."

975
01:06:09,009 --> 01:06:12,143
It's important, when the other
side is being so melodramatic,

976
01:06:12,145 --> 01:06:15,646
to sound like we're the sane ones.
Right.

977

That's all I'm saying.

1157

No, she left without her daughter.
She didn't think she could take care of her.

1158
01:18:04,757 --> 01:18:07,274
Mrs. Rimsky's an alcoholic.
She claimed she was going for treatment

1159
01:18:07,276 --> 01:18:09,510
and had to leave the girl
behind with the father.

take Natasha with him.

I spoke with Grandma Rimsky

is living with her alone.

01:18:20,422 --> 01:18:22,806
So he lied to me.

I didn't want to get involved,
that's all.

Did you see Natasha
after her mother left?

1170
01:18:39,657 --> 01:18:42,459
It's a simple question, Veeck.

Yeah. I see her.

me she leave with the mother.

that she was with her mom,

she was with her father.
