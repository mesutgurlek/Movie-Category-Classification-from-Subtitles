have a date to meet up with some kids

But one day you'll wake up.

And you'll realize there is only
one thing a woman wants.

199
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,905
She will grab your heart,
tear it outta your chest,

200

and throw it on the floor.

- Why not?
- Well, because you're plastered.

207
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,262
So, what difference does that make?

208
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,389
What is rule number one?

209

I know, I know, never turn
away a paying customer.

a packed hearse.

always rule number two.

Never kill a paying customer.

We may have to cancel the tour.

216

Here, give them their money back.

you would tell me, right?

Morty, you gotta believe me.
I saw a real leprechaun.

You mean, like, three wishes,
and give me all your gold and like that?

That's a fairy tale.

This is no fairy tale.
I saw what it can do.

650
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,050
Look. Leprechauns
are devious creatures.

00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:40,304
They are conniving. It says here they live
by trickery, even get pleasure out of it.

Maybe I should've kept you away
from all this supernatural stuff.

He dropped a rack of
pots on my head, Morty.

only be harmed by wrought iron.

Right. Right.

and they make those shoes,

of gold, and if you catch them,
