00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:03,666
What are you reading?

5
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:08,291
I was trying to find the answer
to a question Christine was asking.

6
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:11,291
"If the world's round,
why is a frozen pond flat?"

7
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,166
It's a good question.

8
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,749
Ah-ha!

9
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,166
"Lake Ontario curves
more than 3 degrees

10

"from its easternmost shore
to its westernmost shore."

11
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,499
Frozen water isn't flat.

12
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,166
- Nothing is what it seems.
- My cigarettes...

13
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,374
Did you put
all the slides together?

14
00:04:05,084 --> 00:04:07,791
No, I put the duplicates in my tray.

(John) Oh, shit!

18
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:15,166
(Laura) What's the matter?

19
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:17,749
Nothing.

20

24
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,166
- Hi!
- Hi.

25
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:59,333
- What are you doing?
- Writing to Johnny.

26
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,874
- What did you say?
- Oh, it's just a letter.

27
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,208
- How did it go?
- Oh, God!

28
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:06,916
The deeper we get,
the more Byzantine it gets.

29

I'm restoring a fake.

30
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,499
And you can't change your course?

31
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,124
Not enough bread.

32
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,708
The options are: Restore the fake
or let it sink into the sea.

33
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,458
What did you say?

34
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:22,499
I said, "Daddy's still hard at work
on the windows of St Nicholas,

Maybe you'll know the difference.

"Hope Ellis is being
reasonable this term."

39
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,499
That's his group captain

40
00:09:39,584 --> 00:09:42,041
"I'm enclosing money

"Ask Matron for those.

43
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,208
Just another boring letter.

44
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,041
God, it's cold.

45
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,708
(Howling wind)

46
00:09:56,792 --> 00:10:00,041
Oh, dear,
I've got something in my eye.

47
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,666
It's all right.

48
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:11,041
Want me to put something
on the end of that?

49
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,458
No. Why don't you send him
a card yourself?

50
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,666
It's so cold in here
the waiters don't come.

51
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,624
I must take some time off.

52
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:38,666
- What do you want?
- I'll have what I had last night.

53

(Speaks Italian)

54
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,833
- Did you see the bishop this morning?
- No.

55
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,708
I'm terribly sorry.

56
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,583
Sorry.

57
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,666
- What?
- She's got something in her eye.

58
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,499

59

(Lady #1) I don't know
what he's talking about.

60
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,916
I think I'd better go and help them.

61
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,458
Excuse me.

62
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,666
- Perhaps I can show you where it is.
- That is kind of you.

63
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,499
Thank you so much. How kind.

64
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,874
I hope you don't think us rude.

65
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:44,416
Rude? Why?

66
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:48,333
I mean, staring at you out there.
We're frightful starers.

67
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,499
Comes from living in the country.
Country people stare more.

68
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:56,166
- I'm frightfully sorry.
- I didn't notice it even if you were.

69
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:58,583
- (Lady #2) Which eye is it?
- The left one.

70
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:00,874
- Let me help.
- How can you help?

71
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,083
- I can try.
- No.

72
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:07,249
You nearly put Jocelyn's eye out
the last time you tried poking about.

73
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,624
Well, perhaps...

74
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,874
Perhaps I can help, do you think?

75
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:17,499
That's awfully kind of you.

76
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,708
Oh, dear. Oh...

77
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,916
My sister is blind, you see.

78
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:27,791
- (Laura) Oh, I see.
- Yes.

79
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:14,916
That's it.
It was a tiny black speck.

80
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:17,624
- I think I've got it.
- Well done.

81
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,458
Thank you very much.

82
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:22,791
Goodness,
you do remind me of my daughter.

83
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:27,041
- Oh, really?
- Only her hair is darker.

84
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,374
Oh, really?
Well, here, take your handkerchief.

85
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,499
You're sad.

86
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:38,499
You're so sad,
and there's no need to be.

87
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,041
- My sister's psychic.
- She wants you to know...

88
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,541
I've seen her and she wants you
to know that she's happy.

89
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:51,499
I've seen your little girl sitting
between you and your husband

90
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:53,999
and she was laughing.

91
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,333
Yes.

92
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,333
Oh, yes, she's with you.
She's with you, my dear.

93
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:01,583
And she's laughing.

94
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:04,083
I'm sorry if we stared.

95
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:13,374
She's wearing a shiny little mac.

96
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:16,708
Christine...

97
00:14:16,834 --> 00:14:20,749
But she's laughing, she's laughing.
She's happy as can be.

98
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,416
Oh, you're very like her.
The forehead, the eyes...

99
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,499
- Is that better?
- Yes.

100
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:50,124
- Shall I fetch your husband?
- No, no, I'm all right, thank you.

101
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,208
Good. Jolly good.

102
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:54,999
If you just leave me alone,
I'll be fine.

103
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,791
All right, my dear.

104
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:02,458
Did you?

105
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:06,833
Did you really see her?

106
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,999
She was there.

107
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:31,624
I felt you were right.
I felt we should.

108
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,083
(Cash register rings)

109
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:03,083
Oh, I sent your food back
to get it warmed.

110
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,541
- The mastic that works is number 3.
- Oh, God. I've got to stand up.

111
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,499
I'm sorry.

112
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,458
(Man speaks Italian)

113
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,374
(Siren wails)

114
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,916
(Laura laughs)

115
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:36,708
(Children scream and laugh)

116
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,041
There's nothing but children here.

117
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:55,374
- It was the nearest hospital.
- I've been playing with them.

118
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,333
- I talked to the doctor...
- John?

119
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:59,124
Christine is still with us.

120
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,499
Christine is dead, Laura.

121
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,708
- Christine is dead.
- Of course, of course. I know.

122
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,499
But you know the two ladies
in the restaurant?

123
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,666
They were watching us eating.

124
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,708
They kept staring. They told me.

125
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:16,708
They could see
Christine sitting between us.

126
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:19,333
This is two people
who we don't even know!

127
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,499
Listen, listen...

128
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:25,624
There's one who's blind.
She's the one with the second sight.

129
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,499
She's blind and she described to me
Christine's red plastic mac.

130
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,583
Laura...

131
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:34,833
John, listen,
I'm perfectly all right.

132
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,791
I haven't felt as good as this
in months and months.

133
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,791
I feel really fine.

134
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:43,083
I don't need pills,
I'm not going crazy.

135
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,791
I feel really great.

136
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,249
When did the doctor say
you could leave?

137
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:51,416
Any time. I only fainted.

138
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:56,583
John, I wish you'd believe me.
I really feel fine.

139
00:18:56,667 --> 00:19:00,541
- I really feel good at last.
- I believe you.

140
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,124
Seeing is believing. I believe you.

141
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:06,749
Put your shoes on.

142
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:21,833
(Horn blasts)

143
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:25,166
(Shouting in Italian)

144
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,499
(Speak Italian)

145
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,458
- What did he say? Homicide?
- Yes.

146
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,541
(Horn blasts)

147
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,791
I thought this was the place...
Isn't this where you were?

148
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,458
No.

149
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,999
I want to stop at this church.

150
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:30,374
(John) It's closed.

151
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,499
Why that one?

152
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,916
I just wanted to...
I want to say a prayer.

153
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,624
Oh, Laura!

154
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,583
(? Organ music playing)

155
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,041
- I don't like this church at all.
- Well, I do.

156
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:07,041
- Do you have any change?
- Yep.

157
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,708
- I'm going to light a candle for her.
- How much are candles?

158
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,333
Fifty.

159
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,499
I don't have any fifties.

160
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:20,416
Maybe I'll light six.

161
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:23,999
(He sighs)

162
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,499
Thank you, my love.

163
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:19,041
(Man)... the Madonna is
by Antonio Rizzo in about 1490.

164
00:22:19,167 --> 00:22:23,874
The grille work is also by Rizzo.
Note the flowers woven into...

165
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:42,708
Ah!

166
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,166
- Jesus!
- You hypocrite.

167
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:53,499
The bishop!
I'm an hour and a half late.

168
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,458
(Speaks Italian)

169
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,333
How are you, John?

170
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:33,583
Forgive us, it was entirely my fault.
Nothing to do with John.

171
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:38,333
A woman to share your sins with.
Laura, you're looking much better.

172
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,499
- I'm really terribly sorry.
- Please.

173
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:45,916
The workmen took me
around the church.

174
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:48,291
You have made
some great advances.

175
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:52,416
I'd like you to look at the mosaics
that need to be refired.

176
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,833
I've already been much too long.

177
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,916
Now, when are you both
coming to stay with me?

178
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:00,749
Thursday, if that's all right?

179
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,124
I look forward to it.

180
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,874
I've taken samples from the pilings.

181
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:09,166
We're in trouble down there, too.

182
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:11,583
The churches belong to God,

183
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,708
but he doesn't seem
to care about them.

184
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:20,124
Does he have other priorities?

185
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:24,583
We have stopped listening.

186
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,374
Are you a Christian, Laura?

187
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:34,458
I don't know.
I'm kind to animals and children.

188
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:39,333
St Nicholas is the patron saint
of scholars and children.

189
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:42,833
An interesting combination,
don't you think?

190
00:24:45,542 --> 00:24:48,083
We must talk, John.

191
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:52,166
- Thursday. I'll have your room ready.
- (Laura) Thank you.

192
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:54,291
I'll have the mastic samples by then.

193
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:57,041
The acidity is breaking down
all the adhesives.

194
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:00,791
I look forward to hearing about it.
Thursday.

195
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,791
- Ciao.
- Bye!

196
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:09,874
He doesn't give an ecclesiastical
fuck about the church.

197
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:13,791
- Why did he ask if I was Christian?
- Because you kissed his ring.

198
00:25:13,917 --> 00:25:16,458
What in God's name made you do that?

199
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,291
(Speaks Italian)

200
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,583
No, seriously.

201
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:29,249
You know?

202
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,124
Your bishop really makes me
feel quite uneasy.

203
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,833
He probably makes God
feel less than immaculate.

204
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,583
- No, no. I don't mean that.
- (Speaks Italian)

205
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:43,041
(Speaks Italian)

206
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,874
(Radio on)

207
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,374
I'm going to get down
to some work tomorrow.

208
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,874
Enough of this idling around.

209
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,083
(John) What?

210
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,499
Are you sure we don't have
to book at this place tonight?

211
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:20,833
I don't want that same performance
as happened last time.

212
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:23,583
- What place?
- Oh, John!

213
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:26,833
The place we're going to be eating at.

214
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,333
Yeah, I'm sure.

215
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:32,541
Where's my Neutrogena? OK.

216
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:38,083
(John laughs)

217
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,833
You'll have to read this.

218
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,624
What are you doing?

219
00:26:57,792 --> 00:27:00,999
- I can't hear what you're saying.
- I'm shouting!

220
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:04,208
- I still can't hear.
- What are you doing?

221
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:06,999
I'm having a bath.

222
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,999
You heard me that time.

223
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:54,249
Those lumps are coming back
on the side of your waist?

224
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,458
See?

225
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,916
I weigh 85 kilos,
which is 190 pounds.

226
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,999
- You OK?
- Yes, I'm OK.

227
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:47,791
(Knocking)

228
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:52,416
Come in.

229
00:28:52,500 --> 00:29:02,083
(Speaks Italian)

230
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:15,833
Isn't it a miracle I didn't hurt myself
when I fainted today?

231
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:20,416
The unconscious body reacts faster
than the mind ever can.

232
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:23,374
Perhaps.

233
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:27,208
You've got toothpaste
all over your mouth.

234
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:34,499
Eat it off.

235
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:42,416
I can't get it off.

236
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,666
This.

237
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,749
- (Laura) It was.
- It wasn't.

238
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:24,124
- Was it?
- Mm-hm.

239
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,916
You will be eating here
tonight, I hope?

240
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:33,874
No, thank you.
We're going to eat out tonight.

241
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:36,916
(Speaks Italian)

242
00:35:01,417 --> 00:35:03,583
(Clock chimes)

243
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:05,499
(Laura) Hey.

244
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:08,208
Come here.
I think I've found the way.

245
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:10,666
(John) We've been
over this bridge already.

246
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,624
Well, I never mind
being lost in Venice.

247
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:22,041
Down here.
We take the second left...

248
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,999
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

249
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,458
A nice dark little alley.

250
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:34,916
- (John) Yes, this is it.
- It isn't.

251
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,874
- Yes, it is.
- It isn't, John.

252
00:35:38,042 --> 00:35:40,874
- Come on.
- Oh, it isn't.

253
00:35:56,875 --> 00:35:59,499
(Laura gasps) Oh, rats!

254
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,583
I'm getting out of here.

255
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,333
I know this place.

256
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,749
This is it.
It's the Ponte Giretto.

257
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:24,916
- What?
- It's this one.

258
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,166
No, I...

259
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:27,999
(Hoarse gasping)

260
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:31,624
(Scream)

261
00:36:33,042 --> 00:36:35,249
(Screaming)

262
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,333
What's that, John?

263
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:47,208
It's OK, I've found the real world.
It's down here. Come on.

264
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:58,833
- What on earth was that?
- It was a cat or a rat.

265
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:02,041
- Maybe it was something...
- What, a rat?

266
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,499
This was just around the corner
from where we were.

267
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:16,499
I know where we are now.

268
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:27,166
(Speaks Italian)

269
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,166
Hello.

270
00:38:45,042 --> 00:38:46,874
- Hello.
- Hello!

271
00:38:47,042 --> 00:38:50,458
How extraordinary to see you.
Oh, it's Mrs Baxter.

272
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:54,416
- Yes, I know.
- My husband's restoring this church.

273
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,624
(Speaks Italian)

274
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:09,874
Yes, I do.
I remember her hair.

275
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:12,166
Light hair and silky soft.

276
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,499
She tossed it as she laughed.

277
00:39:15,542 --> 00:39:18,833
- Did she die suddenly?
- Heather, you have no right to...

278
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,124
No, I really wouldn't mind
talking about it, actually.

279
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:24,499
I'll get my coat.
Would you mind waiting?

280
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:26,499
I won't be a second, all right?

281
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:27,791
Thank you.

282
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:02,208
(Laura) Sunday afternoon.

283
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:05,374
We'd just finished lunch.

284
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,916
Oh, I used to smoke then.

285
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,208
And I remember I had this cigarette.

286
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:15,999
You know something strange?

287
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:19,708
John just suddenly got up
and rushed down to the pond,

288
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,749
almost as if he knew
something was going to happen.

289
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:26,583
Well, it was too late,
but it was strange.

290
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,291
- Yes, of course.
- What?

291
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:32,499
Of course. He has the gift.

292
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:37,291
That's why the child was trying
to talk to him. He has the gift.

293
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:41,041
Even if he doesn't know it,
even if he's resisting it.

294
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,541
It's a curse as well as a gift.

295
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,541
(Speaking Italian)

296
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:54,333
It's off centre.

297
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:58,291
(Speaking Italian)

298
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:09,291
You can't...
ever contact people, can you?

299
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:12,874
We're often asked.
She's quite famous round Elgin.

300
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:16,499
They want a lot of mumbo-jumbo
about ectoplasm

301
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,541
and holding hands.

302
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:22,124
Second sight is a gift from
the good Lord who sees all things.

303
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,166
It's impertinent to call
his creatures back from rest

304
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:27,124
for our entertainment.

305
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,708
It wouldn't be for my entertainment.

306
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:35,041
Would you come for tea
when your husband's finished?

307
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,916
Just for a little while?

308
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:43,041
Yes, I'd like that. Thank you very much.
Is that all right?

309
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:47,083
I make no promises.

310
00:41:47,209 --> 00:41:48,249
No.

311
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:53,666
- It's ridiculous.
- They want to meet you.

312
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:57,583
I'm not getting involved with two
neurotic old women in mumbo-jumbo.

313
00:41:58,125 --> 00:42:00,749
I've been trying very hard
to hang on to myself,

314
00:42:00,875 --> 00:42:05,583
to forget about what happened,
to get rid of this emptiness.

315
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,541
It's been with me like some pain,
and finally...

316
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:12,166
Finally through these two women
I've discovered how.

317
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:15,874
They disapprove of mumbo-jumbo, too.
They used that very word.

318
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:19,749
- Of course they do.
- They just want to help, that's all.

319
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:23,624
- Laura, do you not see?
- She's going to try and reach her.

320
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:39,458
OK, Laura, that's enough.
Now, listen to me.

321
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:41,499
I've listened to you.

322
00:42:41,584 --> 00:42:44,708
You said let the children play
where they want to.

323
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:48,874
- You let her go near that pond.
- Thanks for the memories, Laura.

324
00:42:49,042 --> 00:42:52,124
You said you'd give your life
in exchange for hers.

325
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,791
Well, you can't do that.

326
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:56,916
- Jesus H Christ!
- John.

327
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:59,708
She's trying to get in touch with us.

328
00:43:01,084 --> 00:43:02,833
Maybe to forgive.

329
00:43:03,042 --> 00:43:04,333
OK, go on.

330
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:07,708
Go on to your crazy women.
They can have their victim. Go on.

331
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:28,833
Here, drink this. Whisky.

332
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,166
Thank you. I don't really need it.

333
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:33,416
You may, child, you may.

334
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,916
I'll be back in a jiffy.

335
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:38,166
Here you are.

336
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:45,458
- Where are you?
- Me? Oh, I'm here.

337
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:49,624
Oh, the children.

338
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:53,291
- Who are you looking at?
- Um...

339
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,583
There's a boy here
with rolled-up shirt sleeves.

340
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:01,749
- Difficult to tell how old he is.
- Yes, that's Anthony.

341
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:05,499
And then there's Charles
next to him in his uniform.

342
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:08,666
- And then the three girls.
- Mm-hm, yes.

343
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:11,583
- And then there's Angus.
- What, this little bust?

344
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:13,749
Yes.

345
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:15,374
Oh, that's lovely.

346
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:19,499
Yes, he was a gentle child.

347
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:28,666
Oh, you haven't touched your drink.

348
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:29,999
Er, no.

349
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,916
Was that Angus?

350
00:44:34,084 --> 00:44:37,374
I was just looking
at the pictures of your family.

351
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,083
They're wonderful.

352
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:42,458
It jars you, losing one like that.
But I had two more.

353
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,249
So can you, I daresay.

354
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:50,249
Nothing can take the place
of the one that's gone.

355
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:53,624
Now, then.

356
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:59,416
(Baby crying)

357
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,624
It's all right.

358
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,083
It's all right!

359
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,916
(Clock chimes)

360
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:35,999
Are your legs crossed?

361
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,833
Yes.

362
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,499
Switch the light out.

363
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,083
(Moaning)

364
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:12,208
Yes.

365
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:24,083
Yes! Yes!

366
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:26,708
Yes!

367
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:29,208
Yes! Yes!

368
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:31,374
Yes!

369
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,999
- (Speaks Italian)
- English.

370
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,291
John! Yes!

371
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:45,208
- English.
- (Speaks Italian)

372
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:48,208
John! Yes! Yes!

373
00:47:49,209 --> 00:47:50,291
English.

374
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,791
(Wailing)

375
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,374
- English.
- (Speaks Italian)

376
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,499
Yes! Oh!

377
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:00,791
(Shouting in Italian)

378
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,749
(Dog barking)

379
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,458
(Wailing)

380
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,166
(Dog barking)

381
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:12,999
(Moaning)

382
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:14,791
- Oh!
- Here.

383
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:18,541
What did she say?
What did she say?

384
00:48:18,709 --> 00:48:21,208
What did she say?

385
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:24,249
What did she say?
What did she say?

386
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,916
Oh, what did she say?
What did she say?

387
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,208
What did she say?

388
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:13,333
I got scared for you.

389
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,874
I told you it was all right.

390
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:21,666
Those two sisters...

391
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:27,291
- How much have you been drinking?
- You got scared for me, eh?

392
00:49:39,459 --> 00:49:42,124
- God, you're not going to be sick?
- Screw them!

393
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:47,249
- You're just not listening.
- I am not going to be sick!

394
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:51,999
Listen, Heather, the blind one,
she is really psychic.

395
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,833
She has second sight.

396
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:57,124
I mean, you'd understand
completely if you'd...

397
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,249
Today when I was there, she...

398
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:02,999
She went into the most
incredible trance. Really...

399
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,583
- Concentrate.
- Now, John?

400
00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:07,041
Yes?

401
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:13,041
She said that your life is in danger
while you're in Venice.

402
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:16,624
- She kept on and on saying it.
- I am going to be sick.

403
00:50:26,542 --> 00:50:28,291
(Vomiting)

404
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:33,583
(Groaning)

405
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,583
(Toilet flushes)

406
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:51,124
I wouldn't go in there
for a couple of minutes if I were you.

407
00:50:54,042 --> 00:50:56,124
I haven't thrown up for ten years.

408
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:00,208
John?

409
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:05,041
I really think
we have to leave Venice.

410
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:07,749
It was a warning.
It was Christine.

411
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:09,833
She was trying to warn us.

412
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:12,083
How can I?
We must leave, John.

413
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:17,458
Do you hear what I say?
It was Christine, our daughter.

414
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,416
My daughter is dead, Laura.

415
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,083
She does not come peeping

416
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:25,208
with messages back
from behind the fucking grave!

417
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:27,416
Christine is dead.
She is dead.

418
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,374
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead!

419
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:48,708
You must think I'm ill, then.

420
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:49,874
Yes.

421
00:51:57,584 --> 00:52:02,208
If I'm ill,
I should be seeing Dr Jameson.

422
00:52:02,334 --> 00:52:04,124
Yep.

423
00:52:04,917 --> 00:52:07,249
Maybe I am.

424
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:10,208
Maybe I left England too soon
or something.

425
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:19,666
Maybe... Maybe those women
were influencing me.

426
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:24,833
Maybe I shouldn't see them again.
That's what you want, isn't it?

427
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:26,916
Yep.

428
00:52:30,875 --> 00:52:33,291
Maybe I should start
taking my pills again.

429
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:35,249
They're on the desk right there.

430
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:43,541
Here.

431
00:52:55,084 --> 00:52:56,833
Now...

432
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,374
You could get about a couple of weeks
or so off, couldn't you?

433
00:53:02,042 --> 00:53:03,416
Yeah.

434
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,999
Could you?

435
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,624
Yes.

436
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:15,999
Do you really think you could, John?

437
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:23,874
(Bells chime)

438
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:25,833
All right, Laura.

439
00:53:28,209 --> 00:53:29,624
All right.

440
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,124
(Phone rings)

441
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:58,708
- Hello.
- Hello.

442
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:01,291
- (Speaks Italian)
- (Laura) Jesus! Who on earth is it?

443
00:54:01,459 --> 00:54:03,916
- Hello?
- Hello.

444
00:54:04,084 --> 00:54:06,249
(Laura) What's the time,
for God's sake?

445
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:07,916
Operator?

446
00:54:08,084 --> 00:54:10,416
- Operator?
- What's the time?

447
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,541
Operator!

448
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,249
Hello!

449
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,749
Operator,
where is this call coming from?

450
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:19,499
Hello?

451
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:22,416
Hello!

452
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,624
Where in England?

453
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:28,083
- Oh, hello. Is that Mr Baxter?
- John Baxter, yes.

454
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:31,291
Oh, good.
Look, this is Anthony Babbage here.

455
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:34,083
- Yes?
- Headmaster, Porton School.

456
00:54:34,167 --> 00:54:35,999
Yes, that's right.

457
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:40,208
I'm awfully sorry
to get you so late at night, but...

458
00:54:40,334 --> 00:54:42,666
What time is it with you out there?

459
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:44,333
Oh, I see.

460
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:47,999
We got your telephone number
from your London people, you see.

461
00:54:48,834 --> 00:54:53,291
Yes, well, the fact of the matter is
there's been a bit of an accident.

462
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:55,749
It's your son, Johnny.

463
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:59,458
He's been to the san
and he's in very capable hands,

464
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:02,499
but Matron thinks that just possibly...

465
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:05,499
Hello, Mr Baxter?
It's Mandy Babbage here.

466
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:07,291
Yes, poor little Johnny.

467
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:09,458
It was an accident
during fire practice.

468
00:55:09,542 --> 00:55:13,124
There's nothing to worry about
but we did think you ought to know.

469
00:55:13,292 --> 00:55:15,041
Good. Yeah.

470
00:55:16,792 --> 00:55:18,041
Mm-hm.

471
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,458
Tell them I'm catching
the next plane home.

472
00:55:22,292 --> 00:55:23,833
What was that?

473
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:27,416
My wife will be there this morning.

474
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,708
Yes, well,
that's very kind of you, Mrs Babbage.

475
00:55:30,834 --> 00:55:32,124
Thank you.

476
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,874
Yes, good night.

477
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,749
Good morning.

478
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:36,916
Bye.

479
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:42,166
This is what they meant, John,
about leaving Venice.

480
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,583
This is it. This is what they meant.

481
00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:47,999
You see?

482
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:54,458
(Speaks Italian)

483
00:55:55,709 --> 00:55:58,666
Will you get me Alitalia, please?

484
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:02,499
Well, get me the airport, then.
What time do they open?

485
00:56:03,667 --> 00:56:06,541
Oh, Christ!
Thank you. Yes, good night.

486
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:11,249
Darling, she said that she's sure
that he'll be OK.

487
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,291
(Speaks Italian)

488
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,249
(Continues speaking Italian)

489
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,499
A charter flight.
We got the last seat.

490
00:56:32,584 --> 00:56:35,041
Oh, fantastic!

491
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:37,999
He's just finding out
where they go from.

492
00:56:38,084 --> 00:56:41,791
Don't forget to ask the bishop
what we talked about last night,

493
00:56:41,917 --> 00:56:43,624
about staying over in England.

494
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,708
- Oh, yeah. Three weeks?
- Whatever you can do.

495
00:56:46,834 --> 00:56:49,708
I really feel I need time in England
away from Venice.

496
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:52,583
- I'll tell him today.
- You can't come with me now?

497
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:57,541
You call me tonight
and I'll get away by the weekend.

498
00:57:05,459 --> 00:57:06,708
10 minutes.

499
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:16,416
The boat leaves in ten minutes
from Riva Schiavoni.

500
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,999
Mr Baxter? You are coming back?
We are closing.

501
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:27,499
I'll collect everything this morning.

502
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:41,749
(Speaks Italian)

503
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:52,083
Give Johnny my love.
Hold tight.

504
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,416
I'll call you tonight, OK?

505
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,624
(Speaking Italian)

506
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,458
- Hello, John.
- Morning.

507
00:59:52,709 --> 00:59:54,166
Morning.

508
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,708
I'm sorry, but this church
means a great deal to him.

509
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:04,458
You have all worked so hard.

510
01:00:04,542 --> 01:00:07,874
- Are those the mosaics?
- Yes, they arrived this morning.

511
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:12,624
Is something the matter?

512
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,874
Our son had an accident and...

513
01:00:17,042 --> 01:00:20,749
Laura flew to London to see him
at four o'clock this morning.

514
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:24,208
- I will pray for you.
- Oh, he'll be OK.

515
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:28,124
Laura's had some complications
since...

516
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,583
...Christine...

517
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:32,916
You should have gone with her.

518
01:00:35,417 --> 01:00:38,041
- Can I see the mosaics?
- Of course.

519
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,124
They're marvellous.

520
01:00:49,209 --> 01:00:52,499
The firm has worked
for my family for over 200 years.

521
01:00:52,584 --> 01:00:55,749
- Will they be able to match those?
- Sure.

522
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:00,666
May I compare them?

523
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:53,166
Lower me down.

524
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,541
(Speaks Italian)

525
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:10,791
(Creaking)

526
01:03:11,209 --> 01:03:13,083
(Shouting in Italian)

527
01:03:21,042 --> 01:03:23,624
(John cries out)

528
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,291
(Clanging)

529
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:28,083
(Shouting in Italian)

530
01:03:37,667 --> 01:03:39,124
(Banging)

531
01:03:41,209 --> 01:03:43,499
(John cries out)

532
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:45,999
(Shouting in Italian)

533
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:42,874
(Applause)

534
01:04:43,084 --> 01:04:45,333
(Groaning)

535
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:49,999
(Speaking Italian)

536
01:05:10,542 --> 01:05:12,791
(Speaks Italian)

537
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:15,999
Would you like
to sit for a few moments?

538
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:19,749
No, I'm going to walk for a bit.

539
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,874
- May I walk with you?
- Please.

540
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:32,499
- My father was killed in a fall.
- Yes?

541
01:05:32,584 --> 01:05:34,124
Yes.

542
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:37,499
It's unbelievable.

543
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,333
What?

544
01:05:39,459 --> 01:05:44,583
My wife was warned
that I was in danger.

545
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:46,291
Warned?

546
01:05:48,209 --> 01:05:49,583
It was...

547
01:05:50,875 --> 01:05:52,499
It was like a...

548
01:05:54,792 --> 01:05:57,124
It was a kind of prophecy.

549
01:06:00,542 --> 01:06:03,083
I wish I didn't have
to believe in prophecy.

550
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:08,249
I do, but I wish I didn't have to.

551
01:06:23,209 --> 01:06:24,791
(Child calling)

552
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:41,541
(Speaks Italian)

553
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,124
I hope it's not another murder.

554
01:06:54,084 --> 01:06:56,499
(Children laughing)

555
01:06:58,667 --> 01:07:00,124
We should go.

556
01:07:32,709 --> 01:07:34,499
(Speaking Italian)

557
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:37,499
(Speaks Italian)

558
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,166
The bishop's driver will come by
and pick up my things.

559
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:44,083
Thank you.

560
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:48,666
Laura!

561
01:10:03,584 --> 01:10:05,666
(Man speaks Italian)

562
01:10:36,292 --> 01:10:39,458
- Where is the manager?
- (Speaks Italian)

563
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:52,583
(Whispering)

564
01:10:57,834 --> 01:10:59,916
Ah, Signor Alexander.
Has Mrs?

565
01:11:00,084 --> 01:11:03,541
Signor Baxter. I thought you'd...

566
01:11:03,667 --> 01:11:07,666
The end of the season,
you understand. It's my holiday.

567
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:10,624
Has Mrs Baxter come back here?

568
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,249
- (Speaks Italian)
- My wife, yes.

569
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:15,083
- Has she come back here?
- Come back?

570
01:11:15,167 --> 01:11:17,291
- But she left this morning.
- No, no, no.

571
01:11:17,417 --> 01:11:20,208
I just saw her on the Grand Canal.
Has she?

572
01:11:20,334 --> 01:11:24,666
- Has she come back here?
- She missed the plane?

573
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:28,333
No, I'm just asking
if my wife has come back here.

574
01:11:28,459 --> 01:11:31,041
No, signore. We are closed.

575
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:33,499
We are closed.

576
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:40,624
Momi!

577
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:42,541
(Shouts in Italian)

578
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,458
- Did my luggage get away all right?
- Yes.

579
01:12:04,542 --> 01:12:06,499
- You didn't see my wife, did you?
No.

580
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:41,291
(Speaking Italian)

581
01:13:54,792 --> 01:13:56,666
(Speaks Italian)

582
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:36,791
Hello.

583
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:42,124
Sit down, Mr Baxter.

584
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:49,083
This is your wife,
and these are the sketches.

585
01:14:49,209 --> 01:14:52,916
- How are they?
- I guess you'd recognise them.

586
01:14:57,084 --> 01:15:00,833
Age makes women grow
to look more like each other.

587
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,249
Don't you find that?

588
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:08,499
Old men decay
and each becomes quite distinct.

589
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:12,708
Women seem to converge, eh?

590
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:15,999
I hadn't thought about it.

591
01:15:18,334 --> 01:15:23,666
The skill of the police artist
is to make the living appear dead.

592
01:15:29,209 --> 01:15:32,291
You are no longer staying
at the Europa?

593
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:36,249
No. No, it closed for the winter
this morning.

594
01:15:37,542 --> 01:15:41,083
Now, tell me what happened,
from the beginning.

595
01:15:41,792 --> 01:15:44,999
My wife met these two women

596
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:48,083
a couple of days ago and...

597
01:15:48,167 --> 01:15:50,541
One of them, the blind one,

598
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:53,624
claimed to have seen Christine,
our dead daughter.

599
01:15:54,542 --> 01:15:57,999
She said Christine was happy.

600
01:15:58,167 --> 01:16:00,333
My wife collapsed.

601
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:02,583
When she came round,
she was changed.

602
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:06,583
She was happy.
She had come to terms with the death.

603
01:16:09,417 --> 01:16:12,541
She... She was her whole self again.

604
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:14,166
Did you have a row?

605
01:16:14,709 --> 01:16:18,124
A row? No. Well, yes.

606
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:23,249
I was only trying to protect her.
It was...

607
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:25,208
It didn't make any difference,

608
01:16:25,334 --> 01:16:27,874
because she went
to see the women anyway.

609
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:31,791
And when she came back,

610
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:34,249
last night,

611
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:38,374
when we went to bed,
there was a call from England.

612
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:42,583
Our son goes to school in England
and the school phoned to say

613
01:16:42,709 --> 01:16:44,833
that he had an accident.

614
01:16:45,042 --> 01:16:47,416
My wife said that
she had been warned.

615
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:51,291
So I put her on the first plane
to England this morning.

616
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:53,749
And I saw her go.

617
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:56,999
I mean, I put her on the boat.
I saw her leave at 8.30.

618
01:16:58,709 --> 01:17:01,499
Have you called the airport?

619
01:17:01,667 --> 01:17:04,416
Yes. The plane was full.
That's all I know.

620
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:10,749
Please go on.

621
01:17:12,167 --> 01:17:18,041
Then I saw her.
Between 10.30 and 11.00 on a boat.

622
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:19,666
I was on a Vaporetto.

623
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:23,041
She's here in Venice
with those two women.

624
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:28,666
What is it, Mr Baxter?

625
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,124
I do not understand.

626
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:37,458
If she's in Venice,
surely she will get in touch with you.

627
01:17:39,209 --> 01:17:40,708
If she can.

628
01:17:43,334 --> 01:17:45,458
What is it you fear?

629
01:17:54,584 --> 01:17:57,333
The killer on the loose, the murderer.

630
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:02,791
My wife is not a well woman.

631
01:18:05,917 --> 01:18:07,416
Yes.

632
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:10,916
Yes, of course.

633
01:18:13,417 --> 01:18:16,499
I just thought...

634
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:21,999
There must be more.

635
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,624
No, no, there is nothing more.

636
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:31,499
My wife got something
from these two women,

637
01:18:31,584 --> 01:18:35,583
something doctors couldn't give her,
I couldn't give her,

638
01:18:35,709 --> 01:18:38,541
something that she needed,
so she went with them.

639
01:18:38,667 --> 01:18:40,291
Where?

640
01:18:40,417 --> 01:18:43,166
Where? I don't know.
I was outside...

641
01:18:43,292 --> 01:18:46,708
inside the pensione last night,
where they lived.

642
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:51,291
And today before I came here,
I went to look for it.

643
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:53,083
But it's vanished.

644
01:18:58,375 --> 01:19:00,416
So now she's with them.

645
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:12,458
Why should one criticise you
for being worried?

646
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:17,124
Thank you, Mr Baxter,
for talking to me.

647
01:19:17,792 --> 01:19:19,624
I am grateful.

648
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,666
OK, I'll be at the Palazzo Vendori.

649
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:28,333
I want you to help me, Mr Baxter.
Try again.

650
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,416
Try and find the pensione.

651
01:19:31,417 --> 01:19:36,541
It will make me feel we have
your cooperation in a real way.

652
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:42,041
I... er...

653
01:19:42,167 --> 01:19:44,583
I don't even know where to start.

654
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:48,333
Start from where
you saw them the last time.

655
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:51,208
OK.

656
01:19:51,334 --> 01:19:52,916
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

657
01:19:53,084 --> 01:19:55,249
Where did you say?

658
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:57,708
San Nicolò dei Mendicoli.

659
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,916
Ah, yes.

660
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:11,499
(Speaking Italian)

661
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:16,666
Hello!

662
01:24:17,292 --> 01:24:19,166
(Speaks Italian)

663
01:24:19,292 --> 01:24:20,374
Hello!

664
01:24:22,417 --> 01:24:24,499
(Speaks Italian)

665
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:45,999
Thank you, Mr Baxter.

666
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:47,916
(Speaks Italian)

667
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:52,499
Murder squad.

668
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,333
They're not here.

669
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:12,916
Yes, very nice, very nice.

670
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:19,541
(Speaks Italian)

671
01:26:22,542 --> 01:26:24,499
Mr Baxter? Yes, of course.

672
01:26:24,625 --> 01:26:26,583
He's got some people with him.

673
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:29,499
- I'll go and tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

674
01:26:44,709 --> 01:26:57,583
(Speaks Italian)

675
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:12,749
- Sister.
- He won't be long.

676
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:16,291
I have to make a telephone call
to England which is urgent.

677
01:27:16,417 --> 01:27:18,666
- Could I use that phone?
- Certainly.

678
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:21,874
- You just have to complete this form.
- Thank you.

679
01:27:27,834 --> 01:27:30,041
- Can I use this one?
- Yes.

680
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:40,666
(Speaking Italian)

681
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,041
Mrs Babbage? John Baxter.

682
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:58,874
'Mr Baxter. I'm so glad you called.
I've been trying to reach you.'

683
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:02,083
But the wires are down
or some such silly nonsense.

684
01:28:02,209 --> 01:28:05,541
Now, the main thing is
Johnny's absolutely fine.

685
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:10,458
Right as rain. He woke up this morning
with no headache, no after-effects.

686
01:28:10,542 --> 01:28:11,999
Fit as a fiddle!

687
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:15,874
The doctor's let him get up,
and now he's playing around.

688
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:20,499
'The doctor doesn't think
it's concussion.

689
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:23,333
'Johnny's aware
of all the events that led up to it.'

690
01:28:23,459 --> 01:28:24,791
That's marvellous.

691
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,041
That's something
they have to watch for, apparently.

692
01:28:29,209 --> 01:28:31,458
I expect you'd like
to speak to your wife.

693
01:28:31,542 --> 01:28:33,791
- Sorry?
- Here she is.

694
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:37,833
- 'I've lost you.'
- Hello, darling. What?

695
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,833
- Laura?
- 'John, isn't it ridiculous?

696
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,124
'He's perfectly all right.
There's nothing wrong with him.'

697
01:28:44,209 --> 01:28:48,583
Absolutely nothing. He just has
this little bump on his forehead.

698
01:28:48,709 --> 01:28:51,208
John, are you all right?
Where are you?

699
01:28:51,334 --> 01:28:57,166
- I'm at Alberto's.
- 'I'm catching the 9 o'clock plane.'

700
01:28:57,334 --> 01:29:00,666
I don't know what time it gets in,
but we can have a late dinner.

701
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:05,124
- 'I thought I saw you in Venice.'
- Everything is very good.

702
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:08,666
John's fine and I'm OK. OK?

703
01:29:08,792 --> 01:29:10,416
I thought I saw you here.

704
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:14,541
I thought I saw you
with the two sisters, the two women.

705
01:29:14,667 --> 01:29:16,874
I was certain. I swore it.

706
01:29:17,084 --> 01:29:20,333
'Darling, it's all right.
Don't worry, sweetheart.'

707
01:29:20,459 --> 01:29:23,458
I've just found the flight number.
It's...

708
01:29:23,542 --> 01:29:27,124
- Laura, where are you?
- I'm at Porton, John.

709
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:29,249
Johnny and I just got back from tea.

710
01:29:29,375 --> 01:29:32,708
'My arrival time is 11.00.'

711
01:29:32,834 --> 01:29:35,583
Just a second, I'll get a pencil.

712
01:29:35,750 --> 01:29:37,874
'You stay at Alberto's.
I'll come there.'

713
01:29:38,042 --> 01:29:40,499
- OK, I'll wait...
- 'Stay there.'

714
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:45,166
I'll see you about 11, all right?
John, is that all right?

715
01:29:45,292 --> 01:29:47,499
- OK.
- 'John? Are you all right?'

716
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:51,666
- Yes. I love you. Bye.
- 'All right, darling. Bye.'

717
01:29:56,292 --> 01:29:58,166
(Speaks Italian)

718
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,083
John, are you feeling all right?

719
01:30:14,209 --> 01:30:18,374
Yes, I'm fine.
Excuse me, Alberto.

720
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:21,583
I think I just...
I have some things to...

721
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:25,458
- May I use your telephone?
- Sure.

722
01:30:37,292 --> 01:30:39,666
I don't blame you moving in here.

723
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:42,333
- I would have done the same.
- It's very nice.

724
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,291
Do you want to see Johnny again?

725
01:30:44,417 --> 01:30:47,666
- To say goodbye?
- No, I've already said goodbye.

726
01:30:48,209 --> 01:30:51,499
- It would probably be quicker.
- Oh, yes, much quicker.

727
01:31:03,584 --> 01:31:05,749
(Speaks Italian)

728
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:20,666
Wendy?

729
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:22,999
Answer me!

730
01:31:25,417 --> 01:31:29,291
It's me, John Baxter.
Laura's husband.

731
01:31:29,459 --> 01:31:32,624
What's happened to Wendy?
Where is she?

732
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:35,416
I don't know. I'll find out.
Are you all right?

733
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:38,749
- I don't know what's happening.
- Yes, I know.

734
01:31:39,667 --> 01:31:41,541
(Speaks Italian)

735
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,166
- She's at the British consulate.
- Yes, but that was hours ago.

736
01:31:53,417 --> 01:31:57,541
It's half past nine now.
I don't know this room.

737
01:31:57,667 --> 01:32:00,208
I want to go home,
back to the hotel.

738
01:32:02,292 --> 01:32:05,916
This is a police station.
I don't want to stay here, Mr Baxter.

739
01:32:06,084 --> 01:32:09,499
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

740
01:32:09,584 --> 01:32:11,499
It was a misunderstanding...

741
01:32:11,625 --> 01:32:15,041
They took us out of our hotel.
We were arrested.

742
01:32:15,209 --> 01:32:17,208
Then they asked us about your wife.

743
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:19,916
I know. I'm truly, truly sorry.

744
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,624
I'm going to take you back to your hotel.

745
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:26,124
- Yes, please. Take me back home.
- Can you?

746
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:30,374
- If I could just take your arm?
- Please.

747
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:34,041
You see...

748
01:32:34,167 --> 01:32:38,916
you can't understand the noises
in a place like this.

749
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:43,083
I'm so sorry.
I just feel that...

750
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:47,416
If you could just take me back.

751
01:33:16,334 --> 01:33:18,583
(Speak Italian)

752
01:33:28,292 --> 01:33:32,124
One of the things I love about Venice
is that it's so safe for me to walk.

753
01:33:32,292 --> 01:33:34,374
- Steps.
- Thank you.

754
01:33:37,042 --> 01:33:39,999
The sound changes, you see,
as you come to a canal.

755
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,791
And the echoes from the walls
are so clear.

756
01:33:46,459 --> 01:33:50,541
- My sister hates it.
- That's too bad.

757
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:55,833
She says it's like a city in aspic,

758
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,333
left over from a dinner party,

759
01:33:58,459 --> 01:34:01,124
and all the guests are dead and gone.

760
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:04,499
It frightens her.

761
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:06,333
Too many shadows.

762
01:34:09,334 --> 01:34:12,541
- We are almost there.
- Yes.

763
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:18,916
Milton loved this city.
Did you know that?

764
01:34:19,084 --> 01:34:20,791
No. That's interesting.

765
01:34:29,792 --> 01:34:32,833
This isn't the right way, is it?

766
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,166
(Speaks Italian)

767
01:34:37,125 --> 01:34:38,541
This is the wrong way.

768
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:42,083
I was told to take you
to Signor Baxter.

769
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,624
- Yes?
- He is at the police station.

770
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:47,999
It is just on the way.

771
01:34:54,334 --> 01:34:56,083
Puss, puss, puss, puss.

772
01:34:56,209 --> 01:34:59,124
- (Meowing)
- Puss, puss, puss.

773
01:35:00,584 --> 01:35:03,374
I've tried to keep them.
They never stay.

774
01:35:05,042 --> 01:35:07,624
They're very wild in Venice.

775
01:35:08,875 --> 01:35:12,666
- Do you like cats, Mr Baxter?
- Oh, yes.

776
01:35:12,792 --> 01:35:15,916
Yes, I like them all right
but they don't like me very much.

777
01:35:16,084 --> 01:35:17,999
It's all right.

778
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:21,333
- Here's the hotel.
- Thank you.

779
01:35:21,459 --> 01:35:23,708
- These are swinging doors.
- I remember.

780
01:35:23,834 --> 01:35:25,708
I'll keep them open.

781
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:28,708
It's so reassuring to have a man.

782
01:35:28,834 --> 01:35:33,249
We changed hotels. Wendy said
there were prowlers and it was dirty.

783
01:35:35,459 --> 01:35:37,333
- Careful of the steps.
- Thank you.

784
01:35:39,584 --> 01:35:42,833
- Here's the key, Mr Baxter.
- Thank you.

785
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,124
- Room 307.
- 307, yes.

786
01:35:47,834 --> 01:35:49,499
OK, it's here.

787
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:59,624
They said you'd left
at the police station.

788
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:02,791
Wendy, you're back.
Mr Baxter has been looking after me.

789
01:36:02,917 --> 01:36:06,499
- Oh, has he?
- Yes, she was at the police station.

790
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:10,874
She had been there quite a while.
I thought that the best thing...

791
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,208
- They found your wife, then?
- Yes.

792
01:36:13,334 --> 01:36:16,708
- With the killings...
- He's explained everything to me.

793
01:36:16,875 --> 01:36:19,208
Have we a drop of whisky
to offer Mr Baxter?

794
01:36:19,334 --> 01:36:21,083
- You will stay a minute?
- Yes.

795
01:36:21,209 --> 01:36:23,541
There's the miniatures
we got for Jessie.

796
01:36:24,459 --> 01:36:27,333
We're leaving tomorrow.
The aeroplane's arranged.

797
01:36:27,459 --> 01:36:31,083
- Have you put the photographs out?
- They're on the dressing table.

798
01:36:31,209 --> 01:36:34,041
None of that for me.
Just a glass of water for me.

799
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:36,499
I'll fetch it.
Do take a seat, Mr Baxter.

800
01:36:50,667 --> 01:36:53,083
So...

801
01:36:53,209 --> 01:36:57,749
you will be able
to find it quite easily.

802
01:36:57,834 --> 01:37:02,499
Thank you.

803
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:06,833
- It doesn't really look like her.
- It doesn't matter.

804
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,458
- No?
- No.

805
01:37:12,167 --> 01:37:14,833
Please, your photograph.

806
01:37:16,125 --> 01:37:17,166
What?

807
01:37:20,875 --> 01:37:22,166
My God!

808
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:25,624
Thank you very much.

809
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:28,041
Thanks for your help. Bye-bye.

810
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:30,166
Goodbye.

811
01:37:48,625 --> 01:37:49,916
Thank you.

812
01:37:50,042 --> 01:37:53,458
- You're wearing odd socks.
- You put out my clothes.

813
01:37:53,542 --> 01:37:56,666
- I was merely informing you.
- Thank you.

814
01:37:56,834 --> 01:38:00,916
- Laura's plane gets in. I'd better go.
- Let Mr Baxter be off.

815
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:02,499
Wait. Wait!

816
01:38:02,584 --> 01:38:06,499
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- No, it's quite all right.

817
01:38:06,584 --> 01:38:08,041
It'll be all right.

818
01:38:08,542 --> 01:38:09,583
(Yelling)

819
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,416
Wait! Wait!

820
01:38:20,167 --> 01:38:22,499
- Fetch him back!
- Wait!

821
01:38:22,584 --> 01:38:24,499
Please, please!

822
01:38:24,625 --> 01:38:26,999
Let him not go!

823
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:44,083
Please, fetch him back!
Let him not go!

824
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,583
Please, let him not go!

825
01:38:48,375 --> 01:38:50,458
Fetch him! Fetch him!

826
01:38:50,542 --> 01:38:54,374
- Fetch him back. Fetch him!
- No!

827
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:57,624
Fetch him! Fetch him!

828
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:01,374
Fetch him back! Fetch him back!

829
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,541
Fetch him!

830
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:16,583
Mr Baxter! Mr Baxter!

831
01:39:16,709 --> 01:39:18,249
Mr Baxter!

832
01:39:19,292 --> 01:39:21,041
Mr Baxter?

833
01:39:21,167 --> 01:39:23,458
(Rapid footsteps)

834
01:39:37,417 --> 01:39:39,874
- Hello. Is John here?
- Come quickly!

835
01:39:40,084 --> 01:39:42,458
- What is it?
- Quick! Quick!

836
01:39:42,542 --> 01:39:44,041
What is it?

837
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:55,416
- Hurry!
- Is this it?

838
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:58,583
- Mrs Baxter, please.
- Is it Heather?

839
01:40:00,042 --> 01:40:01,666
- It's Mrs Baxter.
- Where is he?

840
01:40:01,834 --> 01:40:06,624
- I couldn't find him.
- Christine. I saw Christine.

841
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:10,499
- He left. He just left.
- Find him. Warn him.

842
01:40:10,584 --> 01:40:12,916
You must find him.
You must warn him.

843
01:40:13,084 --> 01:40:14,999
- She told you.
- When did he leave?

844
01:40:15,125 --> 01:40:16,999
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

845
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:19,249
You must know where he went.

846
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:22,583
- She told you to leave Venice.
- Oh, God!

847
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:24,666
She told you.

848
01:40:24,834 --> 01:40:27,041
Beware! Beware!

849
01:40:36,792 --> 01:40:38,541
(Dog barking)

850
01:40:46,834 --> 01:40:49,541
Laura! Mrs Baxter!

851
01:41:14,084 --> 01:41:15,624
Hey, hey, hey!

852
01:41:15,792 --> 01:41:17,624

(Speaks Italian)

857
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:08,208
I'm coming.

(Man shouts in Italian)

859
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:33,916
It's OK.

860
01:44:34,084 --> 01:44:36,041
(Crying)

861
01:44:37,292 --> 01:44:38,999
I'm a friend.

862
01:44:40,625 --> 01:44:42,541
I won't hurt you.

863
01:44:44,917 --> 01:44:46,291
Come on.

864
01:44:46,417 --> 01:44:47,624
Darlings!

865
01:44:55,084 --> 01:44:56,291
Wait.

866
01:45:00,459 --> 01:45:02,208
