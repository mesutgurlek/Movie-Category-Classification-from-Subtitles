1
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,040
Come on, Pa. We've been
out here over three hours.

2
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:58,005
I mean, we don't even know
where the hell she went.

3
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,657
She's at least...

4
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,787
a 12-footer
if I ever saw one.

5
00:01:04,472 --> 00:01:08,101
No, I ain't leavin' here
without her.

6
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:12,554
Man, I'm cold.

7
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,406
Shh.

8
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,037
Shut your hole.

9
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,469
Come on, man.
Can we pull over?

10
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,905
I gotta take
a piss.

11
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:40,083
Go off the side
of the boat.

12
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:41,616
Come on.

13
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:42,220
We ain't beachin' it.

14
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:45,648
Shit.

15
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:53,069
Jesus Christ.
[unzipping]

16
00:01:55,127 --> 00:01:56,134
[grunts]

17
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:03,312
Oh, come on, man.
I can't go like this.

18
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:05,047
Why in the hell not?

19
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:06,338
Well, 'cause it's weird

20
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:07,910
with you sittin' there
like that.

21
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:09,322
Just keep it down,
would ya?

22
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:10,773
See, no matter
what I say,

23
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:12,023
it's,
"Shut up, Ainsley,"

24
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,797
or, "You're queer,
Ainsley,"

25
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,653
or, "Why can't you be more
like your sister, Ainsley?"

26
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:17,106
I said shut up,
you little queer.

27
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,153
See?

28
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:19,525
See that?

29
00:02:21,986 --> 00:02:22,710
Asshole.

30
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,147
What'd you say, boy?

31
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,882
Nothin'.

32
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:31,018
Now, don't make me throw
you in the swamp, now.

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,729
Yeah, you go--

34
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,302
[roars]

35
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:37,241
Jesus Christ!

36
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:39,044
Jesus, son, what happened?

37
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:40,375
She tried to bite
my sack off!

38
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:49,973
You let her get away,
you moron!

39
00:02:49,974 --> 00:02:52,836
Well, what the hell
was I supposed to do?

40
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:54,691
For crying out loud,
can we just pull over,

41
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:57,232
so I can finish
my damn piss?

42
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:58,079
Lord!

43
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:07,920
Y'all hurry up now.

44
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:15,849
Goddamn queer's
gotta squat to take a leak.

45
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,951

00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:24,014
[thunderclap]

47
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:30,804
Oh, shit.

48
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,291
[splashing in distance]

49
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,384
Keep still, Ainsley.

50
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:42,809
I think she's back.

51
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,547
Well, what should I do?

52
00:03:46,045 --> 00:03:47,336
Don't make a sound.

53
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:49,358
Stay right there.

54
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,096
[thunderclap]

55
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:02,211
Pa?

56
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:05,325
Did you get her?

57
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:10,943
[thunderclap]

58
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:11,953
Pa?

59
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,036
Maybe we can go home now?

60
00:04:18,786 --> 00:04:19,956
[twig snaps]

61
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:27,434
Pa?

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,456
Huh?

63
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:38,469
Pa?

64
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:40,328
Pa?

65
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:44,008
[whimpering]

66
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:44,856
Pa?

00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:47,645
[thunderclap]

68
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:55,972
Come on!

00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,801
Come and get it,
you bitch!

70
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,368
I'll kill you!

71

00:05:04,703 --> 00:05:05,956
Oh, God!

[screaming]

74
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:23,256
It hurts!

00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:25,358
[screaming continues]

76
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,611
Oh, God!

77
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:27,905
Help me!

78
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:19,760
I need some beads.
[chuckling]

79
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:24,871
Cheer up, man. This is
Mardi Gras. This is fun.

80
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,923
And I'm having a blast.

81
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:29,016
Oh, oh, right here, right
here, right here. Look at that.

82
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:31,994
Oh! Look at those boobs
right there. [laughing]

83
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:33,845
Hey!
Hey.

84
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,696
They're somethin'
new, right?

85
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:37,305
Haven't you seen
enough boobs?

86
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:42,377
I'm just not feelin' this.
I-I shoulda stayed at home.

87
00:08:42,378 --> 00:08:44,590
What, so you could sit in your
room and cry about Heather?

88
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,038
Christine.

89
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:49,097
Man, man. We came down here
to have a good time.

90
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:51,913
You? You're fighting it.
There's fun all around you.

91
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:53,322
Stop standing there
like a bitch.

92
00:08:53,323 --> 00:08:54,851
How is this fun?

93
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:56,380
This place is disgusting.

94
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:59,842
Our hotel room smells
like sweaty balls, man.

95
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:02,095
Everybody's just drunk
and looking for a fight.

96
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:05,193
You! You threw up six times
yesterday. How do you even do that?

97
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,125
You guys just stay
and have fun, all right?

98
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,654
I'm gonna go find
something to do.

99
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,666
What, by yourself?

100
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,725
DeWitt and Robinson told me about
this haunted swamp tour thing

101
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:15,979
that they did last year;
they said it was amazing.

102
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,405
You see all these, like, floating
lights and stuff on the water. Just--

103
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:24,268
You wanna leave all of this to go
look at some damn lights in a swamp?

104
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,481
You don't have to
come with me, Marcus.

105
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,253
Look, I'll see you guys
back at the hotel.

106
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:28,816
Cool.

107
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:41,009
Man, wait up, wait up.
Wait up, man. I'll go--

108
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,699
Marcus, no,
go ahead and--

109
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,469
No, no, no. I'm goin'
with you. It's cool.

110
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:45,919
Thanks, man.

111
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,293
Buddy, you're gonna be
so psyched you did this.

112
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:50,144
I think I'd rather
skin my own dick.

113
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:57,387
Right. It's official.
Here it is.

114
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,681
No more chicks.

115
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,371
They're closed.

116
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,343
No. They can't
be closed.

117
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:06,241
But indeed they are. There's
a big "Closed" sign and it's--

118
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:09,219
You're still knocking.
All right, this sucks.

119
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,667
It doesn't suck.
It's gonna be cool.

120
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:13,012
For you,
'cause you suck.

121
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:13,861
Shut up!

122
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:19,000
What do you want?

123
00:10:19,001 --> 00:10:22,803
Uh...we wanted to do
a haunted swamp tour.

124
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:24,988
I don't do
night tours anymore.

125
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:27,052
I'm not allowed to.

126
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:31,908
Okay, it's just that our friends told
us that you did one here last year.

127
00:10:31,909 --> 00:10:35,508
I can't do
night tours anymore.

128
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,757
Insurance got too high...
after what happened.

129
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:43,480
Too bad. Let's roll.
- W-w-w-w-wait.

130
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:46,271
Uh, what happened?

131
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:49,265
Oh, you don't want
to know.

132
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:51,693
I so do.

133
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,757
Here we go.

134
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:58,289
I led a tour group
out in the swamp

135
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,676
last Halloween.

136
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:02,860
It was the midst of night.

137
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,155
Yeah?

138
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:06,098
And there was this kid

139
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,173
who looked kinda like you.

140
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:11,357
He got spooked by
something in the marsh.

141
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:17,144
He saw two eyes staring
at him from the woods.

142
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:19,248
Chilled him to
his very marrow.

143
00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:22,971
He wanted to get
off the boat in a hurry.

144
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:25,236
And he had his foot

145
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:28,959
dangling over the edge.
He--

146
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,497
He fell in?
A gator got him?

147
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:31,832
What happened?

148
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,947
He slipped,

149
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:38,185
hit his head
right on the roof,

150
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:41,745
and sued me for negligence!

151
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:43,040
That cocksucker!

152
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,063
That's it?

153
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:50,039
Try Marie Laveau.
- Excuse me?

154
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:53,560
Two blocks east
on Olive Street.

155
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:56,069
But you didn't
hear it from me.

156
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,374
<i>[birds squawking]</i>

157
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,722
I have to go tend
to my birds.

158
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,536
Be careful walking
on the sidewalk.

159
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:12,819
Wh-whoa, come on,
man, wait.

160
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,144
What?

161
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:15,409
It's dead as hell
down there, right?

162
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,577
Fun party...
bad badness.

163
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:21,681
Wait! Ben,
this is so lame!

164
00:12:21,682 --> 00:12:23,744
How is this gonna help
you get over her?

165
00:12:23,745 --> 00:12:27,467
Marcus, this whole scene
back here, it's just--

166
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:31,229
Every hot, half-naked chick
I see reminds me of Christine.

167
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:34,791
Y'know? Probably gettin'
banged by that Bulkowski guy,

168
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:39,363
in her living room, bent over that
beige loveseat that my mom bought her.

169
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:40,940
What happened to dating
a normal guy?

170
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:43,489
That guy's got a neck
the size of a truck.

171
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,796
And that whole cauliflower
ear? That's weird.

172
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:47,657
What, is he gonna wrestle
her to submission?

173
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:50,045
All right, stop stop stop, that's it.
- All right, okay.

174
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:51,825
I don't wanna think about
Bulkowski bangin' your girl anymore.

175
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:53,321
I don't either.
I get it.

176
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:54,981
Come on, man, this
is gonna be fun.

177
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,900
Guess there ain't no chicks at
the swamp. Won't be needin' these.

178
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:03,963
It'll be fun.

179
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:05,906
'Bout as fun as crabs.
- You would know.

180
00:13:05,907 --> 00:13:07,726
Screw that waitress
from Fezziwig's, man.

181
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:09,345
You did.

182
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:11,165
I didn't know she had
bugs in her bush.

183
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:13,108
She was scratchin'
herself all night.

184
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:15,252
What do you mean,
you didn't know?

185
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,276
You can't hook up with itchy
chicks, Marcus. Everybody knows that.

186
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:20,350
She said it was a reaction
to her fabric softener, okay?

187
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,293
All right?
I saw it, I asked.

188
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:25,004
Fabric softener. Look
at you, mister big shot.

189
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,269
"Everyone knows that." When's
the last time you got laid?

190
00:13:31,115 --> 00:13:32,975
I have sex all the--
- Shut up.

191
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:43,009
Ladies.

192
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,702
This is really fun.
- [Women] Whoo!

193
00:14:01,704 --> 00:14:02,876
Whoa.

194
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:04,899
That's good.
Good. Uh...

195
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,287
Uh...um...

196
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:07,934
Give us a kiss?

197
00:14:09,634 --> 00:14:11,332
Ooh, yes.

198
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,911
Yeah, you love it.

199
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:17,361
You want it.
You need it.

200
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:21,448
Oh, damn, I-I gotta
change batteries.

201
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:23,997
God. Brush
your teeth much?

202
00:14:23,998 --> 00:14:25,453
Lick me, bitch.

203
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:27,720
No thanks, I like my tongue
without the syphilis.

204
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:30,795
You're syphilis,
miss big words.

205
00:14:30,796 --> 00:14:33,020
Okay, that didn't
even make sense.

206
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:35,408
Lick me.
Misty, Jenna...

207
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:37,430
you can get along for a
couple more hours, can't ya?

208
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:40,776
Seriously, Doug? I can't
work with that.

209
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,980
I'm a professional actress.
I went to NYU.

210
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:43,485
[laughing]

211
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,637
What's so funny?

212
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:50,395
Like anybody's ever
even heard of that.

213
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,084
New York University?
- Never heard of it.

214
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:55,742
Girls, girls, nobody ever got
discovered by being difficult, huh?

215
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:59,223
I mean, I-I-I need you guys
to show me the love, all right?

216
00:14:59,258 --> 00:14:59,476
Fine.

217
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:01,392
I need to feel the
passion here, all right?

218
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,476
We're rolling.

219
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,831
All right. I need
to feel the passion.

220
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,260
We're rolling.
[deep breath]

221
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:08,655
All right.
You're sensuous...

222
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,448
You're playful.

223
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:15,458
You're curious.

224
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,144
[Both]
Hmm.

225
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,795
You're smitten.

226
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:21,923
[roar]

227
00:15:24,646 --> 00:15:27,774
[Man] Who's ready to do
some hauntin', huh?

228
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:30,667
Hahaha. The night will
soon be upon us.

229
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:33,324
The spirits of the damned
are on the rise.

230
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,946
Let's get our souls
on the move, my friends!

231
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:39,694
What can I do
you two for?

232
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:42,115
Do you do
a haunted swamp tour?

233
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:46,387
Why, I do the only
haunted swamp tour!

234
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:48,420
Real, live ghosts.

235
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:50,639
Whoo. Tales of the macabre.
[gasps]

236
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:56,274
And actual sites that are
still damned by voodoo curses.

237
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:59,820
I hate you.
Oh!

238
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:02,529
Leaving right now,
40 bones each.

239
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:05,319
Forty dollars?
- Yes.

240
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:07,069
All right.
Will you spot me?

241
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:08,749
Why? You don't
have any cash?

242
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,398
No, I'm just not paying
for this bullshit.

243
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:14,837
I know, darling.
Hello.

244
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:16,048
Hi.

245
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:18,837
Hi there.

246
00:16:18,872 --> 00:16:21,142
How are you doin'?

247
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:22,504
Oh, my.

248
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:26,893
Oh, hey.

249
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,474
You mind if
I sit here?

250
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:31,836
Be my guest.

251
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,501
Hello.

252
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:40,816
Hey.
Oh, hi.

253
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:51,156
Uh...so...I guess
I'm sitting here.

254
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,364
I'm Ben.

255
00:17:06,399 --> 00:17:08,170
Marybeth.

256
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:11,400
Marybeth. That's
a great name.

257
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:14,375
'Cause it's actually
two names, you know.

258
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:19,605
Most people just have one,
and that's kinda boring.

259
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,000
Ben.
But Marybeth, it's--

260
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:27,222
you know, it's Mary
and it's, uh, Beth.

261
00:17:27,257 --> 00:17:28,231
That's a nice coat.

262
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,798
So do you have
any pets or--

263
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:42,254
Are you enjoying
Mardi Gras?

264
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:44,489
Yep.

265
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:48,056
Couldn't find anyone brave enough
to do the ghost tour with you, huh?

266
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:49,987
Nope.

267
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:53,166
Right on.
Right on.

268
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:55,169
Some buddies of mine back
home went on this tour--

269
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:56,848
Look, I'm sorry.

270
00:17:56,883 --> 00:17:59,052
I didn't come on this tour
'cause I was hoping

271
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:01,541
that just maybe
I'd get to meet you.

272
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:03,961
If you don't mind,
I'd like to just sit

273
00:18:03,996 --> 00:18:07,477
and stare out this window
and get my $30 worth, okay?

274
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,402
[horn blares]

275
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:15,900
Hey, what the fuck?

276
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,764
Okay, folks, I am
your tour guide, Shawn.

277
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:49,744
Just sit back and get
ready to enjoy--

278
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,117
[Marcus] Uh, dawg? You don't
need that thing.

279
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,299
It's, like, the size
of a Mini Cooper.

280
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:54,553
[Tour group laughs]

281
00:18:54,554 --> 00:18:56,573
Hahaha. See who laughs,
eh, pukai?

282
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,937
Like a Mini Cooper limo,
you know what I mean?

283
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:03,320
[Marcus] That's what I'm
talkin' about.

284
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:05,018
I'm--
- I--

285
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,129
Oh, no, you--
- We--

286
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,280
We are so cute
when we do that!

287
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,775
I'm Marcus.
- Jenna.

288
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,947
Hello there.

289
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:15,079
Jim Permatteo.

290
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:19,038
And this here's
the missus, Shannon.

291
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,251
How do you do?

292
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:22,028
Doug Shapiro.
Nice to meet you.

293
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:23,119
Nice camera.

294
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,008
Makin' a movie?

295
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:26,635
Yeah.

296
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:28,493
Well, what do
you know, lovekins?

297
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:30,998
We've got ourselves
a director over here.

298
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:34,554
How exciting. What kind
of movie is it?

299
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,858
<i>Well, have you ever heard
of Bayou Beavers?</i>

300
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,433
Sure. No.
- No.

301
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:40,413
Okay, everyone.
If you take a look

302
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:41,948
out your right side,
you'll see

303
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,736
the legendary Saint Louis
Cemetery Number One,

304
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:48,212
uh, founded in
178, uh, 9,

305
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:51,484
this here's the resting place of
the first black mayor of New Orleans,

306
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:53,626
Ernest Morial.

307
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,211
It is also believed
to be the burial site

308
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,514
of the infamous
voodoo queen Marie Laveau.

309
00:19:58,516 --> 00:20:00,292
Haha, yes, sir.

310
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:03,565
Now, y'all notice how we bury
our dead above the ground?

311
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:06,192
Well, that's because of all the
voodoo curses in the air down here.

312
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:08,172
The dead have a tendency
to rise out of the dirt,

313
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,080
so we like to keep 'em
cemented in instead.

314
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:14,919
Shawn, excuse me, but we heard that
the reason you bury them above ground

315
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,778
is because of
the water level.

316
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:18,758
Oh, no.
- That's right.

317
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,909
The water level is so high that
sometimes things in the ground

318
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,132
will rise back up
to the surface.

319
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:26,273
No, that's not why.
But we heard--

320
00:20:26,274 --> 00:20:28,900
<i>I said no!
[feedback]</i>

321
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:41,829
All right,
time's wasting.

322
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,283
Everyone onboard.

323
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:46,396
[Shawn]
Scary bus to scary boat.

324
00:20:46,397 --> 00:20:48,294
Everyone.
- Watch your step, lovekins.

325
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:53,143
All right, all right,
heh heh heh heh.

326
00:20:55,124 --> 00:20:58,073
Hey there, hey there, all right.
No time-- No time for dilly-dallying.

327
00:20:58,074 --> 00:20:59,930
Gotta beat the rush.
That's right.

328
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:08,255
All right, all right,
comin' through.

329
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:09,628
Okay, gotta go, gotta go.

330
00:21:18,802 --> 00:21:19,204
Dude.

331
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:22,719
That's the boat?

332
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:26,154
Okay, let's, uh,
see something, girls.

333
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:28,578
[Both]
Whoo!

334
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,468
[Doug]
Okay, you're silly.

335
00:21:29,469 --> 00:21:32,458
You're tough.

336
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,478
You're cute.

337
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,498
You've got a secret.

338
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,192
Come on, lovekins.

339
00:21:44,193 --> 00:21:45,872
--look like she's old
enough to be in porn--

340
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:48,458
Oh!
[giggles]

341
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,519
That's it, all aboard.

342
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:54,559
All right, here we go.
[engine sputters]

343
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:58,923
[Man]
Hey! You there!

344
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:01,630
Hello!

345
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:04,742
Mr. Shawn, I think that man's
trying to talk to you.

346
00:22:04,743 --> 00:22:06,923
Oh, no, no, no.
Heh heh.

347
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:10,438
Hey! Where ya think you're goin'?
[engine sputters]

348
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,297
What's he saying?

349
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:16,136
Oh, that guy? Don't mind him.
That's just Jack Cracker.

350
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:18,116
[Jack yelling]
Jack Cracker?

351
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:20,580
Yeah, yeah, one of the local
alligator hunters.

352
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:22,197
Just sits there,
yells things.

353
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:24,258
Drinks his own piss.

354
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,550
He's, you know,
cracked.

355
00:22:25,551 --> 00:22:27,409
[engine sputters]
Come on.

356
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,591
This swamp is closed!

357
00:22:31,128 --> 00:22:32,622
[no audible sound]

358
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:36,177
Hey! The swamp is--
[engine sputters]

359
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,884
Victor Crowley!

360
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:40,258
What's he saying?

361
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,834
[engine sputters]

362
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:43,976
[engine starts]

363
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:47,248
Okay, okay, okay, here we go.
Everybody wave bye-bye to Jack.

364
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,349
Everybody wave bye-bye to Jack.
- Whoo!

365
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,622
[Tour group]
Bye, Jack! Bye, Mr. Cracker!

366
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:53,794
Bye-bye!

367
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:03,613
You're all gonna die.

368
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,987
[burps]
Oh, yeah. That's good.

369
00:23:18,686 --> 00:23:20,220
[Shawn] Remember, you don't
need to keep

370
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:22,240
all your fingers
and toes onboard,

371
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:23,492
just the ones
you want to keep.

372
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:25,715
Heh heh heh. That's right.

373
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:28,584
There's big alligators
in these here waters.

374
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:30,644
Hey, now, check it out.
Off to the left,

375
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:32,907
you'll see something you don't
see every day, but I do.

376
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:36,625
Heh heh. Real live
cypress tress.

377
00:23:36,626 --> 00:23:39,776
Now here, what did the Spanish
moss say to the cypress?

378
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:43,089
"Mind if I hang around?"
Heh heh heh.

379
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,797
<i>You know, sometimes I'll tell
that joke in español.</i>

380
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:48,544
[Mr. Permatteo] Hey there, isn't
the cypress the Louisiana state tree?

381
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:50,080
[Shawn]
I bet it sure is.

382
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:52,261
[Mr. Permatteo] Yeah, since 1963,
the bald cypress.

383
00:23:52,262 --> 00:23:54,726
[Shawn] Oh, now, only room
for one guide

384
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:56,908
on this boat now. Heh heh.

385
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:58,565
Now, we're gonna move
into a part of the swamp

386
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:00,666
with the scary ghosts, y'all.

387
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:03,211
I need everyone to be
overenthusiastic,

388
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:06,161
or you'll wind up
overboard.

389
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:14,363
Now, here on
the Mississippi Bayou,

390
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:18,242
hundreds of fishermen and old
pirates have lost their lives.

391
00:24:18,243 --> 00:24:20,182
And if we're lucky, we might
be able to see their souls

392
00:24:20,183 --> 00:24:23,009
floating over the waters
where they up and died.

393
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,040
Now, you all should feel very safe.
- This is beat.

394
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,980
Come on, man, give it
a break. This is fun.

395
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:29,758
'Bout as fun
as a bag of dicks.

396
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,818
This is beat as hell.

397
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:34,444
Only thing scary is
Uncle Remus meets Bruce Lee.

398
00:24:34,446 --> 00:24:36,910
<i>Feel like I'm in Enter the
Song of the South or some shit.</i>

399
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:38,646
What about your
new girlie here, huh?

400
00:24:40,143 --> 00:24:42,082
She all right.

401
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,939
But it's not like I'm pulling
the ass on this stupid boat.

402
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,930
Okay, so lay the groundwork,
set it up for later.

403
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:48,506
Like you and
what's-her-face?

404
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:50,486
"That's a nice coat."

405
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:52,668
That was classic.

406
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:56,991
About as classic as--
It's about as classic as--

407
00:24:56,992 --> 00:24:59,011
I got nothin'.
- Exactly.

408
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:08,385
Now, comin' up, you'll all see a
old house with a barn behind it.

409
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:11,942
That right there is the home of
a real famous Louisiana legend,

410
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,325
Victor Crowley.
Hatchet Face.

411
00:25:14,326 --> 00:25:17,759
The legend is, is that
he was a deformed man

412
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,961
whose own father went nuts and whacked
him in the face with a hatchet one night.

413
00:25:21,962 --> 00:25:26,244
Probably on account of he
was so ugly or something.

414
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:28,871
Anyway, he died.

415
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:33,154
And so the story goes is that if you're ever
near the old Crowley house late at night,

416
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:37,033
you'll still hear old Victor
Crowley cryin' for his daddy.

417
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:45,073
Daddy.
[gasps] - Y'all hear that?

418
00:25:45,075 --> 00:25:46,650
Hmm.

419
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:49,559
[high-pitched]
Daddy!

420
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,731
I done heard it again!

421
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:52,589
That ain't the story.

422
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,529
That's the gist
of it, anyway.

423
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,711
It's not even the house.

424
00:25:56,712 --> 00:25:58,165
Christ! Would you just
let me do my job?

425
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:00,185
[shouting in foreign language]

426
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,327
Y'all try
the crawfish yet?

427
00:26:06,328 --> 00:26:09,358
I'm so psyched
I did this.

428
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,580
That fade you had
in high school.

429
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:11,820
What?

430
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,963
It's about as classic
as that fade you had--

431
00:26:13,964 --> 00:26:15,135
Too late.
- What?

432
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:16,954
You still on classic?
[sigh]

433
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:19,540
[Shawn] Are y'all ready to see
something really scary?

434
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:21,601
Huh? Are y'all ready?

435
00:26:21,602 --> 00:26:23,216
Everyone who's ready
say, "Oh, yeah".

436
00:26:25,481 --> 00:26:28,146
Okay, I'm gonna do it anyway.
Here we go.

437
00:26:28,147 --> 00:26:31,378
Okay, folks, I'm gonna shut
the lights off for a second.

438
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:38,006
Once your eyes adjust, you'll be
able to see some of the ghost lights,

439
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,914
just hovering above the water
over to the right at Kwaj Island.

440
00:26:47,097 --> 00:26:48,429
I don't see anything.

441
00:26:48,431 --> 00:26:50,652
Uh, wait till
your eyes adjust.

442
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:53,157
They're adjusted, there's
just nothing there.

443
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:54,531
Hey, can we get those
lights going again?

444
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:55,986
You're killing all
my camera shots.

445
00:26:59,624 --> 00:27:02,087
Jim, look! I think
I see something.

446
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,552
Oh, that's right.
Yeah, you see?

447
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:07,622
Not one but two ghosts!
Yeah, I told y'all.

448
00:27:07,623 --> 00:27:10,653
Isn't that just a chemical reaction
from the water and the gases?

449
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:12,633
No, no, no, man! It's--
They're ghosts! Look!

450
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:17,966
Nah, bra. Those are marsh
vapors. I've seen this on TV.

451
00:27:19,786 --> 00:27:23,017
Hell, man, why'd you all
come, then? They're ghosts!

452
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,269
Oh, you're right.

453
00:27:26,493 --> 00:27:27,947
Except no.

454
00:27:27,948 --> 00:27:28,633
[Guys laughing]

455
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:35,704
Damn it.

456
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:40,513
Now, uh, that's the spot
where Captain John Donovan

457
00:27:40,514 --> 00:27:44,675
supposedly buried
a trunk full a treasure.

458
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:48,514
Legend says, though, that he left
two of his crew behind to guard it,

459
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:51,018
but he cut off their legs
so they couldn't run away.

460
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:54,251
That's a stupid story.

461
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:55,463
Fine.

462
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:56,755
[Woman screams]

463
00:27:56,757 --> 00:27:59,180
Jim, did you see that?

464
00:27:59,181 --> 00:28:01,362
I did. What was that?

465
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:05,564
Oh, it could-- it c-could be
one of the more active spirits

466
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,544
we sometimes get
after it rains.

467
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:10,049
Hoo hoo hoo, it's spooky,
isn't it, folks? Hahaha.

468
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,412
[engine sputters, starts]

469
00:28:12,717 --> 00:28:14,575
Okay, perfect.
Perfect.

470
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:16,959
Hey, who wants to be in
the Halloween video?

471
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,373
Ugh.
- Come on, girls.

472
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:27,868
[Both]
Whoo!

473
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:31,828
Okay, your "Whoo" is
so not in the moment.

474
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:32,596
Yeah? Well, your
nipples are dumb. Ugh.

475
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:36,757
This is pretty cool.

476
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,525
It's cold.

477
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:43,061
Not much of
a talker, are you?

478
00:28:43,062 --> 00:28:44,151
I ain't here
to make friends.

479
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:49,890
Friends. Nice.
Must be a local.

480
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:52,677
I just didn't know that
locals did this touristy stuff.

481
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,707
We don't.
- No, of course. Yeah. No.

482
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:58,496
Yeah, I wouldn't really
do it either, normally.

483
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:03,182
It's just buddies of mine from college
told me about it and said it was cool, so...

484
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:05,728
I figured what
the hell, you know?

485
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:09,284
Check out the swamp.
Enjoy the activity.

486
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:11,789
I'm gonna be honest
with you right now.

487
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,667
I, uh, just got dumped by my
girlfriend of eight years,

488
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:19,103
and, uh, my friends took me down
here to try to get my mind off of it,

489
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:21,446
but, you know, I--

490
00:29:21,447 --> 00:29:23,547
We were together since
the seventh grade May Dance,

491
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:26,416
and, you know, she tells
me she needs space.

492

What does that even mean
in girl language?

493

Space.

Whatever.

Oh, we just...
got stuck.

499
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:48,437
Stuck? On what?

500
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,699
Oh, on some rocks or something.
I don't know.

Someone give me a hand.

00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:00,396
[Shawn] Here. Help me push
the boat off.

gonna call, Daddy?

Shut up,
you nasty bitch!

512
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:28,115
I would call the police
and they'd send someone.

Who?
- The cops. Duh.

The police are gonna
send the cops.

No, they're not!
There's a difference.

- Yuh-huh.

I'll get us unstuck.

No! No, we're
not sinking.

it now, doesn't it?

on goes all the way to the shore.

the middle of nowhere?

Well, we can't
stay here.

should stay here and wait for help.

There's gotta be another tour

Probably not. It's

I just moved down
here from Detroit.

616
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:50,310
My brother, he hooked me up
with this touristy gig,

of dough, so I say try it out.

have you done?

boats you ever driven?

last night.

here tonight, all right?

sink last night!

does she have a gun for?

want to know.

Because I'm lookin'
for another boat, okay?

627
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,250
My daddy and my brother went out
hunting on this river two nights ago

and they never came back.

off on a bender or something somewhere,

what happened.

So you go on a ghost tour?
How does that make any sense?

632
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:29,180
30 bucks for a boat ride
was a hell of a lot cheaper

633
00:36:29,182 --> 00:36:30,554
than gettin'
my own boat, wasn't it?

634
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,817
That still doesn't
explain the gun.

635
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:35,322
Yeah, and why her ticket
was only 30 bucks.

636
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:39,403
I have a gun because
these woods aren't safe.

637
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:41,625
Besides, it just
saved his life.

638
00:36:41,627 --> 00:36:44,857
[wails]
Stop it! My husband needs help.

639
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:48,373
Look, we need to get him help and
we need to get outta these woods.

640
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,111
Who made you the leader?

641
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:52,817
We should call for help
and stay right here.

642
00:36:52,818 --> 00:36:55,969
No bars.
I hate the south!

643
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,342
I don't think we should
move him right now.

644
00:36:57,344 --> 00:36:59,525
Well, we have to!
- He's bleeding

645
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:01,667
pretty badly; we can't
carry him all the way home.

646
00:37:01,668 --> 00:37:03,484
If we don't get out
of these woods right now,

647
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:04,212
we're all gonna die.

648
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:08,696
What are you talking about?

649
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,021
These are his woods.

650
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,354
Whose woods?

651
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:15,848
Victor Crowley.

652
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:18,556
Enough with
the stories already, huh?

653
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:22,030
Y'all don't even
know where you are.

654
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:25,222
I already told you that--
[Ben]- All right, shut up.

655
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:26,476
Okay? You're not
even from here.

656
00:37:29,022 --> 00:37:31,203
Where are we?

657
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:34,556
It was like
a dirty secret.

658
00:37:37,265 --> 00:37:40,133
<i>Victor Crowley was born
horribly disfigured.</i>

659
00:37:40,134 --> 00:37:42,678
<i>His daddy kept him
hidden away in his house,</i>

660

<i>alone.</i>

665
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:35,246
<i>Victor was scared
to death of other kids.</i>

666
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:36,862
<i>They teased him
and tortured him,</i>

667
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:39,043
<i>like kids do.</i>

668
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:41,832
<i>They were so cruel.</i>

<i>And then, years later,
on Halloween night,</i>

672
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,500
<i>some teenagers came
to the house.</i>

673
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:54,681
<i>They were tryin' to
get a look at him,</i>

00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:55,772

<i>Mr. Crowley got home, and he

00:39:32,866 --> 00:39:35,773
<i>He could hear Victor screaming

[screaming]

680
00:39:37,996 --> 00:39:43,411
<i>So he ran and got himself a hatchet,
and he started chopping at that door.</i>

681
00:39:43,412 --> 00:39:47,168
<i>But Victor was pressed up against
the other side, trying to get out.</i>

682
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:49,714
[screams]

683
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:54,886
<i>And it was an accident, but he hit
him in the face with that hatchet,</i>

684
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:56,663
<i>and poor Victor Crowley died.</i>

685
00:40:01,674 --> 00:40:03,653
<i>The old man became
a recluse after that.</i>

686
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:05,512
<i>He never
left his house,</i>

687
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:07,128
<i>just sat there
for almost ten years,</i>

688
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,755
<i>before he finally died
of a broken heart.</i>

689
00:40:20,908 --> 00:40:24,502
And from that point on, people
started disappearing in this swamp.

690
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:27,049
All the locals
and hunters say

691
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,634
that if you get close enough
to the Crowley house at night,

692
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:33,150
you can still hear
Victor Crowley,

693
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:34,887
cryin' for his daddy
in the woods.

694
00:40:36,747 --> 00:40:40,383
They say he's come back.

695
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:42,524
He wanders
the swamp at night,

696
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:45,109
with that hatchet slash
across his face.

697
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:49,191
This whole part of the river's
illegal to even be in.

698
00:40:49,192 --> 00:40:51,292
It has been for years.

699
00:40:51,293 --> 00:40:53,312
That's why there's
no other tour boats.

700
00:40:53,313 --> 00:40:55,817
And that's why he
brought us this way,

701
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:58,524
so he wouldn't get caught
running his phony business.

702
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,222
That's why I came.

703
00:41:00,223 --> 00:41:01,797
To find your father?

704
00:41:04,465 --> 00:41:07,009
And my brother.

705
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:10,767
They started comin' down this
way to hunt gators last week.

706
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:14,403
Thought they'd catch more, bein'
the only boat in a closed-off swamp.

707
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:16,181
I told them
not to come.

708
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:19,737
So you think a ghost
got your family?

709
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:21,434
Okay, that--that
is so stupid!

710
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:23,939
Look around. There's
no one in these woods!

711
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:25,556
Yes, there is.

712
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:27,697
They probably got stuck,
just like we did,

713
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:29,960
and had to walk
the whole way home.

714
00:41:29,962 --> 00:41:32,304
Right now, they're probably
sittin' at a Denny's or something.

715
00:41:32,305 --> 00:41:34,323
Moons Over My Hammy.

716
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,111
Besides, we are nowhere
near the Crowley house.

717
00:41:37,112 --> 00:41:38,728
Okay? I already told you,

718
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,031
it's on the other side of
the river, over two miles ago.

719
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,243
That wasn't the house!

720
00:41:42,244 --> 00:41:43,658
How do you know?

721
00:41:43,659 --> 00:41:44,627
Because that is.

722
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:47,657
[thunderclap]

723
00:41:47,659 --> 00:41:50,728
Look, I told you all
the truth, okay?

724
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,183
I don't care
who believes it.

725
00:41:52,184 --> 00:41:56,385
You are really starting
to freak me out, all right?

726
00:41:56,386 --> 00:41:57,840
I just want to go home.

727
00:41:57,841 --> 00:41:59,860
Tell me this is
part of the tour.

728
00:41:59,861 --> 00:42:02,406
Oh, yeah, I sink
the boat every night.

729
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:03,457
It's hilarious.

730
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:08,992
I want my money back.

731
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:12,143
All right, okay. There's gotta be
a road around here or something.

732
00:42:14,852 --> 00:42:15,860
Shit.

733
00:42:15,862 --> 00:42:18,003
I don't wanna
go that way.

734
00:42:18,004 --> 00:42:19,416
I'm not
going that way.

735
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:21,032
If it's
the quickest way,

736
00:42:21,034 --> 00:42:23,012
then that's the way
we're going!

737
00:42:23,014 --> 00:42:25,518
Why couldn't you keep your
stories to yourself, huh?

738
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,053
We're not
in enough trouble

739
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:30,043
that you had to scare the
pants off everyone, too?

740
00:42:30,044 --> 00:42:32,831
I am trying to help you.
Y'all need to know the truth.

All right, all right. Just-- You
help me come pick him up, all right?

743
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,306
Come on. Right
over my shoulder.

744
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,923
[grunts]
Get up.

745
00:42:41,924 --> 00:42:43,903
Be careful, be careful.
Easy, easy.

746
00:42:43,904 --> 00:42:45,397
You got him, man?

747
00:42:45,398 --> 00:42:49,155
I'm right
here, Jim.

748
00:43:03,257 --> 00:43:05,601
Here you go.
Easy, easy.

749
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:08,712
All right, everything's
gonna be just fine.

750
00:43:08,713 --> 00:43:11,741
Look, we'll get him some help
and we'll all go home.

751
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,035
Stay close to me.

752
00:43:15,702 --> 00:43:18,409
You're really scared
of that story, huh?

753
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,227
I mean, look, it's just
a myth. Everybody has 'em.

754
00:43:20,228 --> 00:43:22,369
Bigfoot,
Loch Ness Monster.

755
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,702
Please stop talking.
- Okay.

756
00:43:28,996 --> 00:43:32,914
I cannot believe that I
am out here in a swamp.

757
00:43:32,915 --> 00:43:34,894
I bet Julia Roberts
didn't have to do this

758
00:43:34,895 --> 00:43:36,308
<i>before she got
Mystic Pizza.</i>

759

Do you believe that

760
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:40,954
Oh, absolutely not.

761
00:43:40,956 --> 00:43:43,055
I don't trust
anyone around here.

762
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:45,521
I mean, these people sleep
exclusively with their own families.

763
00:43:49,885 --> 00:43:53,320
Yo, why is it that the crackers
are back there with the honeys

764
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:56,552
and we two brothers gotta
carry the injured dude?

765
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:57,885
I am so sorry.

766
00:43:57,886 --> 00:43:59,946
I never meant for
any of this to happen.

767
00:43:59,947 --> 00:44:01,682
I just want
to get to a road,

768
00:44:01,684 --> 00:44:03,057
then I'm gonna
whip your ass.

769
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:05,198
Jim, how you
doin', baby?

770
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,602
I'm so cold. It hurts
like a son of a gun!

771
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,219
How much further is
the road past the house?

772
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:16,714
I don't know.
Few miles.

773
00:44:16,715 --> 00:44:21,442
A few miles?
Are you kidding me?

774

[faint, echoing whisper]

You are all

Somebody help us!

00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,008
We need help!

783
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:54,210
Please stop. We shouldn't have gone
this way. We need to turn around.

784
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:56,837
And go where?
Back in the water?

00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:02,534
We need to
stick together.

787
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:04,393
We need to stop him.
- Come on!

788
00:45:04,394 --> 00:45:08,433
Y-Y-You can't carry him all by yourself.
[thunderclap]

789
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:11,625
I'm right here, baby.
Everything's gonna be all right.

790
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:12,716
We don't need
those loonies,

791
00:45:12,717 --> 00:45:14,898
those cowards!

792
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:16,838
Stop! We need
to stick together.

793
00:45:18,576 --> 00:45:19,463
Everything's gonna
be just fine.

794
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:27,141
We have the Good Lord
with us, baby.

795
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:28,434
The Good Lord
will protect us.

796
00:45:30,051 --> 00:45:31,505
[roars]

797
00:45:33,971 --> 00:45:34,818
Raahr!

798
00:45:36,072 --> 00:45:37,969
Aah!

799
00:45:39,264 --> 00:45:40,151
Aah!

800
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:41,121
Ohh!

801
00:45:44,436 --> 00:45:45,202
Oh, my God!

802
00:45:51,628 --> 00:45:52,556
Come on!

803
00:45:52,558 --> 00:45:53,324
Stop!

804
00:45:55,345 --> 00:45:57,768
Help us! Help us!

805
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,465
Aah!

806
00:46:12,032 --> 00:46:13,324
Aah!

807
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:26,012
[sobbing]

808
00:46:28,882 --> 00:46:32,921
Wait! Wait!

809
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,508
It's me! It's me!
It's me!

810
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:38,901
Where is everyone?
- I don't know.

811
00:46:38,902 --> 00:46:40,437
We're over here.
What happened?

812
00:46:40,438 --> 00:46:41,609
They're both dead.

813
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,871
[sobbing]

814
00:46:43,872 --> 00:46:47,427
But I shot him.
[Misty]- You shot him?

815
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,487
But I thought he was a ghost!
You can't shoot a ghost.

816
00:46:49,488 --> 00:46:50,699
You can shoot
a ghost?

817
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:52,760
Did you kill him?
- I don't know.

818
00:46:52,762 --> 00:46:55,104
He fell down.
- God, this isn't happening!

819
00:46:55,105 --> 00:46:56,478
W-W-Where's Marcus?

820
00:46:56,479 --> 00:46:57,892
Up here.

821
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,609
What are you
doing? Get down!

822
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,074
Don't-- No way. No way.
I'm stayin' right here.

823
00:47:04,076 --> 00:47:06,620
This is bullshit, man,
this is fucked up.

824
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:08,437
What can you see
from up there?

825
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:10,620
I can see ain't no dead
Elephant Man comin' to get me.

826
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:12,681
Come on. Do you see
a road? Lights? Anything?

827
00:47:16,884 --> 00:47:19,146
I think I see downtown,
but I don't know.

828
00:47:19,147 --> 00:47:21,004
Well, how far?
What direction?

829
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:25,933
That way. But it's far,
way too far.

830
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:29,772
All right. Did you see a
road or cars or something?

831
00:47:29,773 --> 00:47:31,308
What kind of
stupid shit, man?

832
00:47:31,309 --> 00:47:32,802
It's dark, it's wet,
and I can't see shit.

833
00:47:34,622 --> 00:47:36,116
Wait. Where's Shapiro?

834
00:48:13,371 --> 00:48:15,673
Doug! Hey, Shapiro,
where are you?

835
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:17,330
Keep it down!

836
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:18,501
We need
to keep moving.

837
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:20,199
We can't just
leave him out here.

838
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,824
Then why don't you just
run off and go find him?

839
00:48:22,825 --> 00:48:24,036
That was mean.

840
00:48:24,038 --> 00:48:25,248
Try your phone.

841
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:27,067
I dropped it.

842
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:28,563
You lost it?

843
00:48:28,564 --> 00:48:30,825
Moron!
- Shut up, skank.

844
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:33,856
Enough! He could not have
gotten very far, okay? Let's go!

845
00:48:33,857 --> 00:48:35,513
All right, Marcus,
come on, let's go.

846
00:48:35,514 --> 00:48:38,461
No way. No, I'm
stayin' right here.

847
00:48:38,462 --> 00:48:40,401
No need to
panic, okay?

848
00:48:40,402 --> 00:48:41,573
Just come down.
We gotta go get help.

849
00:48:44,281 --> 00:48:47,311
All right. We'll send someone
for you tomorrow. Let's go.

850
00:48:47,312 --> 00:48:48,644
Wait, wait,
hold up, hold up.

851
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:51,472
I'm comin'.
Damn it.

852
00:48:51,473 --> 00:48:54,664
Not even supposed to be
here right now, man.

853
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:57,655
Supposed to be lookin' at some
titties, man. What's wrong with us?

854
00:48:57,656 --> 00:48:59,715
Shit. How the fuck did I
get up in this goddamn tree?

855
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,251
[thud]

856
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:07,837
God damn it, a branch
hit me in the nuts.

857
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:10,180
[grunting]
[branches breaking]

858
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:11,271
This is bullshit.

859
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:15,756
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

860
00:49:40,203 --> 00:49:41,938
[strangled screams]

861
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:55,192
[Misty] If you shot him,
aren't we safe now?

862
00:49:55,194 --> 00:49:56,930
Maybe he's not a ghost.

863
00:49:56,931 --> 00:50:00,283
Maybe-- Maybe he's just some sick,
twisted backwoods hick

864
00:50:00,284 --> 00:50:02,789
who, like, snapped
and went on a killing spree.

865
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,051
Yeah, and now he's dead
because she shot him.

866
00:50:05,052 --> 00:50:06,707
Ugh, get
your own theories.

867
00:50:06,709 --> 00:50:08,001
Oh, God.

868
00:50:08,002 --> 00:50:10,021
Some backwoods hick, huh?

869
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:13,052
Who says it's not some spoiled
little city brat who went crazy

870
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:15,435
after doing soft-core porn
to get back at her parents?

871
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:17,617
Okay,
for your information,

872
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:19,273
I am from the Valley,
not the city.

873
00:50:19,275 --> 00:50:21,011
Victor Crowley is real.

874
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:27,112
My mama always said
that sometimes,

875
00:50:27,113 --> 00:50:29,214
if a person dies
all traumatic-like,

876
00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:32,891
then their spirit can get kind of
just stuck in the night they died.

877
00:50:32,892 --> 00:50:34,708
Like
a poltergeist?

878
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:37,577
Like a ghost that can
physically move things?

879
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:40,164
No, like a ghost who can
rip someone to pieces

880
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:42,507
right in front of you.

881
00:50:42,508 --> 00:50:44,245
I just wanna get
the hell out of here.

882
00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:46,185
You know what,
Jackie Tucker?

883
00:50:46,186 --> 00:50:47,962
Your tour sucks my ass.

884
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:49,335
What did you just call me?

885
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,073
You heard me.
Say it again!

886
00:50:51,074 --> 00:50:53,537
I'll say it all night, you
fake Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker,

887
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:55,517
"I think I hear a little Emeril,"
you confused wanna-be--

888
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:57,497
Why don't you just get
off my case, asshole?

889
00:50:57,499 --> 00:50:58,548
It was an accident,
for Christ's sake!

890
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:04,851
Okay, look.

891
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,913
I'm going to be completely and
totally honest with you guys.

892
00:51:06,914 --> 00:51:08,004
I, like--

893
00:51:08,005 --> 00:51:09,377
Ooh, shit!
- What? What?

894
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:10,266
Ah!

895
00:51:12,812 --> 00:51:15,317
Marcus, come on!
Come on!

896
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:17,741
Hey, come on!
Shit!

897
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:18,993
Stop. Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

898
00:51:18,994 --> 00:51:20,326
This isn't my fault,
all right?

899
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,145
Oh, really?
- Yes, really!

900
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:23,681
What, you think
I actually believe

901
00:51:23,682 --> 00:51:24,772
these stupid, lame-ass
ghost stories?

902
00:51:24,773 --> 00:51:26,266
Well,
I'm believing it now!

903
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:28,408
Did you see that shit back there?
- Guys! Guys.

904
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,822
I bet this means
Shapiro was here.

905
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:35,802
[scoffs]
What a genius.

906
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:38,024
You do know the vibrator goes in
your cooch and not your ear, right?

907
00:51:38,026 --> 00:51:40,165
Hey, why don't you suck
your dad off again, bitch?

908
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:41,338
I will right after
you're done.

909
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:42,065
Fine.
- Good.

910
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:46,793
All right,
anybody got a lighter?

911
00:51:46,794 --> 00:51:47,843
What are you doing?

912
00:51:47,844 --> 00:51:48,732
I'll show you.

913
00:51:53,865 --> 00:51:55,076
Looking for this.

914
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,834
What else do we got here?

915
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:06,632
"Samuel M. Barrett?"

916
00:52:06,633 --> 00:52:07,156
What's that?

917
00:52:10,593 --> 00:52:12,450
Shapiro.

918
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:13,905
It's his driver's license.

919
00:52:13,906 --> 00:52:15,238
What?
- I don't know.

920
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,774
Credit card:
Samuel M. Barrett,

921
00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:19,117
ten bucks, condom,
business car--

922
00:52:19,118 --> 00:52:21,784
We got two sets here.

923
00:52:21,785 --> 00:52:25,178
Samuel M. Barrett, Whitman
Diagnostics Senior Marketing Manager.

924
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:27,481
Doug Shapiro,
Producer/Director.

925
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,441
That asshole!

926
00:52:31,442 --> 00:52:34,229
I flew all the way down here
from New York, and he--

927
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:35,925
Ugh!

928
00:52:35,926 --> 00:52:38,714
<i>[gasps] So he really didn't
work for Bayou Beavers?</i>

929
00:52:38,715 --> 00:52:40,168
I'm thinking no.

930
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:41,502
Dude must pretend
he's a producer

931
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:43,279
to get his own
little collection.

932
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,451
Good idea.

933
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:47,158
That pervert.

934
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:50,270
Why are all men
such slime?

935
00:52:50,271 --> 00:52:51,725
I can't believe
I've fallen for that shit

936
00:52:51,726 --> 00:52:53,744
three times now.

937
00:52:53,746 --> 00:52:55,966
Okay, whoa, whoa.

938
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:57,906
Anyone else have
anymore secrets?

939
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,280
Because if I find out
someone else is lying,

940
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:00,936
I swear
I'll kill you myself.

941
00:53:16,656 --> 00:53:19,119
I didn't really go to NYU.

942
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:24,695
It was my first choice,
but I didn't get in.

943
00:53:24,696 --> 00:53:27,241
So I went to Hofstra.

944
00:53:27,242 --> 00:53:28,211
We don't have
time for this.

945
00:53:44,212 --> 00:53:48,010
I was moving to Hollywood
next month to be famous.

946
00:53:48,011 --> 00:53:50,636
And now I'm going to die
with all you assholes!

947
00:53:50,638 --> 00:53:52,414
Look, we shot him,
all right?

948
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:53,666
Nobody's going to die.

949
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:54,636
[screaming]

950
00:53:54,637 --> 00:53:55,929
Ah! Oh!

951
00:53:57,223 --> 00:53:59,848
[screaming]

952
00:53:59,849 --> 00:54:01,384
Will somebody
shut her up?

953
00:54:03,081 --> 00:54:04,536
He's still alive.

954
00:54:04,537 --> 00:54:06,151
No, man, he looks
dead as shit.

955
00:54:06,152 --> 00:54:07,526
Not him...

956
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:08,940
Crowley.
[gasps]

957
00:54:08,941 --> 00:54:10,798
Okay, you only shot him,
like, once, right?

958
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:12,212
Maybe you gotta
shoot him more times.

959
00:54:12,213 --> 00:54:13,626
Like, I don't know,
four or six times.

960
00:54:13,628 --> 00:54:15,364
Maybe you gotta shoot him,
like, six times!

961
00:54:15,365 --> 00:54:16,737
I wanna keep moving!
Can we please keep moving?

962
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:18,233
I don't want to stay here!

963
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:20,011
We should stick to where
we can see the river,

964
00:54:20,012 --> 00:54:21,788
so we won't get more lost.

965
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:23,243
<i>Shh.
# [pop]</i>

966
00:54:23,244 --> 00:54:24,899
Did y'all hear that?
- What?

967
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,466
It's over here.

968
00:54:33,629 --> 00:54:35,405
What is that?

969
00:54:35,407 --> 00:54:36,658
What is that?

970
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:37,870
My cell phone!

971
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:42,476
<i># I don't wanna wait #</i>

972
00:54:42,477 --> 00:54:45,426

973

974
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:49,749
We have a signal.

975
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,245
Oh, God.
- No, no, no.

976
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,376
It's a good thing.
We can call for help.

977
00:54:52,377 --> 00:54:54,840
No!

978
00:54:54,841 --> 00:54:58,073
Shit, we just went
in a huge circle!

979
00:54:58,075 --> 00:54:59,325
I thought you knew
your way around here.

980
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:01,103
Oh, said the fucking
tour guide.

981
00:55:01,104 --> 00:55:02,194
Hey, I don't want to hit you,
but you're making it--

982
00:55:02,195 --> 00:55:03,406
Shut the fu--
[ghostly breath]

983
00:55:06,276 --> 00:55:09,023
[beep]

984
00:55:09,024 --> 00:55:11,892
Okay, I'm gonna go check out that
barn, see if there's a weapon.

985
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:13,387
There's gotta be something
else to fight back with.

986
00:55:13,388 --> 00:55:15,044
No, you can't go back
to that house.

987
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,821
I only have a few shots left.
We need something else.

988
00:55:16,823 --> 00:55:18,155
What if it comes back?

989
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:19,730
We don't have much time.

990
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:24,337
All--
Stay here.

991
00:55:24,338 --> 00:55:26,398
Cool.
- Cool.

992
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:27,933
Do you have signal
on that thing?

993
00:55:27,934 --> 00:55:30,761
Come on.
Go through.

994
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:32,538
We shouldn't stay here.
We gotta keep moving.

995
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,155
Look, if it was ringing,
it has to work.

996
00:55:34,156 --> 00:55:37,307
Ew! Scott Barnes called me?

997
00:55:37,308 --> 00:55:39,771
What? Will you just dial?

998
00:55:39,773 --> 00:55:42,196
It won't let me.

999
00:55:42,197 --> 00:55:43,892
[dialing]
Work, God damn it.

1000
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,571
I think he ate these things.

1001
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,441
Aah!

1002
00:56:42,442 --> 00:56:44,219
Shh, shh, shh!
What? What?

1003
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,552
[sobbing]

1004
00:56:56,907 --> 00:56:59,653
It's my daddy and my brother.

1005
00:57:12,181 --> 00:57:14,118
No...

1006
00:57:16,018 --> 00:57:18,240
Are you sure
the number is 911?

1007
00:57:18,242 --> 00:57:19,977
What else would it be,
dumbass?

1008
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,512
Well, how should I know
if it's the cell?

1009
00:57:21,514 --> 00:57:23,574
Maybe you have to type in
a different area code.

1010
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:26,038
Oh, God.

1011
00:57:28,666 --> 00:57:29,351
What?

1012
00:57:30,808 --> 00:57:32,342
Don't move.

1013
00:57:37,313 --> 00:57:39,171
[creature mewling]

1014
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:40,383
I said--

1015
00:57:40,384 --> 00:57:41,958
[thunder rumbling]

1016
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:42,524
[whispers]
Sorry.

1017
00:57:44,909 --> 00:57:46,363
[mewling continues]

1018
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:48,827
I think we should run.

1019
00:57:48,828 --> 00:57:51,049
What if it's a person
and they need help?

1020
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:53,150
We'll apologize later.

1021
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:56,625
[mews]

1022
00:57:56,627 --> 00:57:57,798
I think there's
a kid in there.

1023
00:57:57,799 --> 00:57:59,939
You're crazy.

1024
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,242
If it was that monster,
we'd already be dead.

1025
00:58:02,243 --> 00:58:05,029
Screw this.

1026
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:06,888
What is that?

1027
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:11,332
Aw, hell, no.

1028
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:12,424
I'm not walking
over there.

1029
00:58:12,425 --> 00:58:13,636
What if someone's hurt?

1030
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:15,373
If they're still alive,

1031
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:18,323
they're doing a lot better
than some people we know.

1032
00:58:18,325 --> 00:58:20,222
We just can't leave
someone out here to die.

1033
00:58:20,223 --> 00:58:21,475
Look who grew a conscience.

1034
00:58:21,477 --> 00:58:23,819
Look, they might need help.

1035
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,910
Why me?

1036
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,727
Because you have
a flashlight.

1037
00:58:31,577 --> 00:58:33,960
Fine. I get it.

1038
00:58:33,962 --> 00:58:35,576
I see how it is.

1039
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:37,556
Let the brotha do it, huh?

1040
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:39,819
I'm a man.

1041
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,718
I'll walk over here.

1042
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:45,273
I'm the man of the group
anyway, because I whooped you.

1043
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:47,455
All right.

1044

Don't touch me, man!

1046
00:58:53,356 --> 00:58:55,982
Damn. All right.

1047
00:58:57,518 --> 00:58:59,537
See if it's a little
baby in there.

1048
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:01,880
Hey, baby.

1049
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:03,658
You up in here?

Give me--

No...

1058
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:55,095
No! Please!

1059
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:56,872
Wait, wait. No.
No, wait, wait, wait--

1060
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:01,358

Aah!

[panting]
No!

1066
01:00:40,188 --> 01:00:41,359
Ow! Shit! Ow!

1067
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:45,803
I think we're losing him.

1068
01:00:45,805 --> 01:00:46,894
Ow! Hold on!
- No--

1069
01:00:46,896 --> 01:00:48,390
I can't run!

1070
01:00:48,391 --> 01:00:50,572
You have to!
- What are you doing? Come on!

1071
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:51,905
Shut up,
you redneck twat!

1072
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,167
Uh!

1073
01:01:00,472 --> 01:01:03,825
[sobbing]
You...hit me!

1074
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,441
Yeah, and if you
don't shut up,

1075
01:01:05,443 --> 01:01:07,057
I'm going to kick
your teeth out.

1076
01:01:07,058 --> 01:01:10,572
You cruel, stupid, slutty--

1077
01:01:10,574 --> 01:01:13,764
Guys, we don't
have time for this!

1078
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:15,744
[crying]
I just want to make it stop.

1079
01:01:15,746 --> 01:01:17,441
Please, I just want
to wake up.

1080
01:01:17,442 --> 01:01:19,057
We have to keep moving
away from that house.

1081
01:01:19,059 --> 01:01:20,916
It don't matter.

1082
01:01:20,918 --> 01:01:22,735
This is his swamp.

1083
01:01:22,736 --> 01:01:24,190
He's just going
to kill us all.

1084
01:01:24,191 --> 01:01:26,249
There's gotta be something
that we can do.

1085
01:01:26,251 --> 01:01:28,553
He is trapped in the night
that he was killed.

1086
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:30,816
He's angry,
and he is scared.

1087
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:32,715
He's gonna mutilate
anyone that comes near him.

1088
01:01:32,716 --> 01:01:35,422
What if he's human?
What if he never really died?

1089
01:01:35,424 --> 01:01:37,603
That thing
was never human.

1090
01:01:37,605 --> 01:01:39,745
Oh, shit.

1091
01:01:39,747 --> 01:01:41,928
Guys, battery's not
gonna last much longer.

1092
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:43,584
All right.
Let's go, let's go!

1093
01:01:43,585 --> 01:01:45,927
Which way?
- Um...

1094
01:01:45,929 --> 01:01:47,544
That way.
- Raahr!

1095
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:50,453
Uhh!

1096
01:01:55,747 --> 01:01:57,928
[sniveling, crying]

1097
01:02:00,636 --> 01:02:03,342
[Ben]
Stop! Stop, guys!

1098
01:02:03,343 --> 01:02:04,717
Guys, stop!

1099
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,433
This is useless.

1100
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:09,645
He's just going
to keep coming for us

1101
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:10,615
until we're all dead.

1102
01:02:10,616 --> 01:02:11,827
We can't stop running.

1103
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,403
What else
are we going to do?

1104
01:02:13,404 --> 01:02:16,029
We can hurt him,
ghost or not.

1105
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:17,646
Look, you saw
how fast he fell

1106
01:02:17,647 --> 01:02:19,303
when I stuck him
back there.

1107
01:02:19,304 --> 01:02:21,808
He went down
when you shot him.

1108
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:23,344
I'm saying we fight back.

1109
01:02:23,345 --> 01:02:25,566
How?

1110
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,383
Missy, you got
that lighter on you?

1111
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:29,605
Oh, you want to fight
that monster with my lighter?

1112
01:02:29,607 --> 01:02:32,839
Look, there were some
gas canisters back at the shed.

1113
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,889
Were they full?

1114
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:36,596
I don't know.
Maybe.

1115
01:02:36,598 --> 01:02:38,576
Wait, you want to go
back to the shed?

1116
01:02:38,577 --> 01:02:41,041
I thought the further we got
from the house, the safer we get.

1117
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:43,465
If we don't kill him,
he'll kill us all.

1118
01:02:43,466 --> 01:02:45,324
You're crazy!

1119
01:02:45,325 --> 01:02:47,101
Man, you don't even know
if there's gas in those cans.

1120
01:02:47,103 --> 01:02:49,122
I know it's a better
chance than we have

1121
01:02:49,124 --> 01:02:51,506
running around in these woods,
getting picked off one by one.

1122
01:02:51,507 --> 01:02:52,799
No, you're right.

1123
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,849
Everything is soaked.

1124
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,425
How are we going
to start a fire?

1125
01:02:55,427 --> 01:02:56,759
If one of us
can get close enough

1126
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,930
to throw that gas
on him...

1127
01:02:57,931 --> 01:02:59,628
We can light him up.

1128
01:02:59,629 --> 01:03:01,042
[laughs]
You're all high.

1129
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:02,294
No way.
I am not--

1130
01:03:02,295 --> 01:03:03,425
Do you have a better idea?

1131
01:03:03,426 --> 01:03:05,002
No.

1132
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:07,506
All right,
let's do this.

1133
01:03:07,507 --> 01:03:08,395
How?

1134
01:03:22,255 --> 01:03:24,315
[whispers]
Hurry.

1135
01:03:24,317 --> 01:03:26,780
Hey, buy me some time
in here, all right?

1136
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,134
Yell if you hear anything.

1137
01:03:40,882 --> 01:03:43,347
Ugh.
- Okay.

1138
01:03:43,348 --> 01:03:45,851
Okay.
- Okay.

1139
01:03:45,852 --> 01:03:47,952
Ooh.
[shivers]

1140
01:04:00,156 --> 01:04:02,458
[twig snaps, rustling]

1141
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,378
[rustling continues]

1142
01:04:06,379 --> 01:04:07,751
You see anything?

1143
01:04:07,752 --> 01:04:09,044
Nuh-uh.

1144
01:04:12,399 --> 01:04:13,368
[shriek]
Ah!

1145
01:04:18,056 --> 01:04:19,631
[Ben]
I'm okay!

1146
01:04:21,975 --> 01:04:24,237
[sighs]
Oh, shit.

1147
01:04:26,218 --> 01:04:28,479
I don't like this.

1148
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,933
It's too quiet.

1149
01:04:29,935 --> 01:04:31,671
All right, come on.
Let's distract him.

1150
01:04:31,672 --> 01:04:32,925
Hey, asshole!

1151
01:04:32,926 --> 01:04:34,581
Come out!
We're right here!

1152
01:04:34,582 --> 01:04:35,914
Yeah, come out
and get us, Crowley!

1153
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:37,369
Where are you?

1154
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:39,228
Come on, you freak!

1155
01:04:39,229 --> 01:04:41,005
You look like you've
been molested by wolves!

1156
01:04:43,147 --> 01:04:45,086
[Marcus] Show yourself,
you ugly bastard!

1157
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:50,339
Come and get me, Crowley!

1158
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:52,520
What? You afraid I'm gonna
whip your ass again,

1159
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:53,611
you little bitch?

1160
01:05:02,018 --> 01:05:03,229
All right, come on!

1161
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:04,965
One on one!
Me and you!

1162
01:05:04,966 --> 01:05:06,986
I'll put my foot
so far in your ass

1163
01:05:06,988 --> 01:05:09,290
you're gonna be pulling shoelaces
out your teeth for a week!

1164
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:09,814
[creak]

1165
01:05:16,604 --> 01:05:18,704
[sloshing]

1166
01:05:18,705 --> 01:05:20,199
You see anything?

1167
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,653
Nothing.

1168
01:05:26,059 --> 01:05:27,270
Oh, shit.

1169
01:05:27,271 --> 01:05:28,361
Ben, get outta there!
- Ben!

1170
01:05:28,362 --> 01:05:29,775
[Marcus]
Hurry up! Get out!

1171
01:05:29,777 --> 01:05:31,310
Ack!

1172
01:05:31,311 --> 01:05:32,805
Ah! Oof!

1173
01:05:35,028 --> 01:05:38,543
Raahr!
- Aah!

1174
01:05:38,544 --> 01:05:39,310
Uh!

1175
01:06:06,303 --> 01:06:07,837
Yes! Burn, bitch!

[thunderclap]

1178
01:06:26,788 --> 01:06:28,605
You gotta be
fucking kidding me!

1179
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:34,545
Now what?
- No, just come on. Let's just go.

1180
01:06:35,718 --> 01:06:36,727
Ben.

1181
01:06:36,728 --> 01:06:39,514
Ben, you--
Hey, look at me!

1182
01:06:39,516 --> 01:06:41,414
All this bought us is time.
Don't waste it.

1183
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:41,899
Come on.

1184
01:07:19,073 --> 01:07:22,345
[heaving]

1185
01:07:25,498 --> 01:07:27,072
This way.

1186
01:07:27,073 --> 01:07:28,810
There's gotta be a path
that leads into the cemetery.

1187
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,295
Shit.

1188
01:07:37,296 --> 01:07:39,477
This is shit, man.
- Shit.

1189
01:07:41,094 --> 01:07:42,346
Over here.

1190
01:07:50,912 --> 01:07:52,730
Oh, shit.

1191
01:07:54,549 --> 01:07:57,579
All right, let's follow this
till we find an opening.

1192
01:08:07,156 --> 01:08:08,246
[Ben]
There it is.

1193
01:08:08,247 --> 01:08:09,417
Thank God.

He's gonna kill me! Go!

1197
01:08:34,834 --> 01:08:35,640
There's a gate!

1198
01:08:48,168 --> 01:08:49,339
Oh, shit!

1199
01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:56,368
Oh! He got me!

1200
01:08:56,369 --> 01:08:59,036
Ow! Guys...

1201
01:08:59,037 --> 01:09:00,248
You guys are gonna
break me in half!

01:09:18,432 --> 01:09:19,925
That was the only gate.

1206
01:09:19,926 --> 01:09:20,976
Aw, damn, man!

1207
01:09:20,977 --> 01:09:22,714
It's back into the woods.

1208
01:09:22,715 --> 01:09:23,926
No!

[bones cracking]

1210
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:30,876
Run!

1211
01:09:30,877 --> 01:09:32,491
No!
[Marcus]- Run!

1212
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:36,572
Ow! Oh!

I can't go any further.

Yes, you can!

Come on.
- No.

We're not going
to die out here, okay?

Come on!

No! No!

1236
01:10:54,233 --> 01:10:55,889
You'll get eaten alive
in there.

1237
01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:57,505
Then where do we go?

1238
01:10:57,506 --> 01:10:59,202
Aah!

Ahh!

That's my daddy's boat.

Come on. Come on.

Here.

1256
01:13:12,097 --> 01:13:13,308
Use this.

Hey. Hey.

We're alive.

We made it.

1267
01:14:05,676 --> 01:14:07,532
I know.
