What are you
doing, man?

332
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,023
You want 10cc's
of that pink

333
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,424
tranquilizer
in your ass?

334
00:21:34,492 --> 00:21:36,060
That was
Lori's house.

335
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:37,995
They said something
about a murder.

336
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,129
I gotta--
I gotta go to her.

337
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,798
I gotta see
if she's ok.

338
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:42,900
Back to Springwood?

339
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:45,202
Do you want me to start
having nightmares again?

340
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,204
Don't start with that
dream demon shit again.

341
00:21:47,271 --> 00:21:50,874
Ok? You know that's all
just in your head.

Yeah, yeah,
and who are you,

the poster boy
for sanity?

344
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:55,312
You're the one
that told the cops

345
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:56,947
Lori's dad killed
his wife.

346
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,548
Yeah, right, and now it
looks like someone else

347
00:21:58,616 --> 00:21:59,783
got killed
in the same house.

348
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,284
You think that's
a coincidence?

349
00:22:01,352 --> 00:22:03,854
2 murders
in one house?

350
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:07,290
Kurt, how many times
do I have to tell you, man?

351
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:09,026
I don't do checkers.

352
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,061
I'm an uno guy,
all right?

353
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,163
So go grab the
fucking uno deck

354
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,366
and we'll play, ok?
Please. Thank you.

355
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:22,139

We're not going anywhere.

All these years,
and you're still convinced

363
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,401
you saw her father
do that?

364
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:53,237
I know
what I saw, mark.

365
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:54,704
Fuck what
the doctors try

366

to get me
to believe.

367
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:58,341

Are you sure
you didn't see anyone?

No, dad,
none of us did.

379
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,302

with the police.

go to sleep, dad.

I just want to
see my friends.

terrible nightmares.

really real.

00:27:31,132 --> 00:27:32,733
I mean,
there was this man,

465
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,801
but he more like
a monster really,

466
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,202
and they kept
calling him Freddy,

467
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,038
and he was so real.
Shh!

468
00:27:38,106 --> 00:27:39,439
What did he
look like?

469
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:42,275
He--he had this...

470
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:44,144
Dark brown hat, and...

471
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:46,579
His skin was
terribly burnt,

472
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:48,949
and on this right hand
he had this like these

473
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:50,483
razor fingers, and--

these little girls...

477
00:27:54,522 --> 00:27:56,289
It's ok. It was
a bad dream.

478
00:27:56,357 --> 00:27:58,659
They were singing like
this--this song like--

 1, 2, Freddy's
coming for you

they sing that?

he comes for you...

to be alive.

484
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,274
Who is he?

485
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:15,642
He's a child murderer

from around here

487

burned alive,
but then he came back.

488
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:23,416
Back for revenge
in our nightmares.

489
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,118
Funny no one ever
told us about him, huh?

490
00:28:25,186 --> 00:28:26,386
Ok, thank you!
No!

491
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:27,520
Want some free advice?

492
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:29,389
Coffee.
Make friends with it.

493
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:30,991
Will: Mark!

494
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:33,694
That's enough.

495
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:36,529
You're scaring her.

496
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:41,467
Will?

497
00:28:41,535 --> 00:28:43,670
Hey.

498
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:45,405
Uh...

499
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,276
I thought you might
be in trouble, so we--

500
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:51,812
Lori!
Oh, my God!

501
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:52,979
Lori, honey,
wake up!

502
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:55,481
Someone get help,
please!

503
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:57,117
Someone get
some help, please!

504
00:28:57,185 --> 00:29:01,154
The principal! Will,
let's go, let's go!

505
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:02,856
Please, somebody
help her. Lori?

506
00:29:11,432 --> 00:29:13,800
How much longer
is it gonna take?

507
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:15,468
Is she ok or what?
Shh.

508
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:17,204
Tsk!

509
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:43,363
For nose jobs,
what kind of anesthesia

510
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,031
do the doctors use?
They put you

511
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:46,633
all the way under,
right?

512
00:30:00,314 --> 00:30:01,514
Ohh!

513
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:02,849
Got your nose!

514
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:04,651
Aah!

515
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:06,386
Ohh!

516
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:11,524
Strong work, man.

517
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:12,692
I came to make sure
she's ok

518
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,961
and you put her
in the infirmary.

519
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:20,200
What were you
thinking about,

520
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,035
telling her
all that stuff, man?

521
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:23,103
I mean,
we're not in group.

522
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,271
Because I'm thinking
for the first time

523
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:26,406
in my life that
maybe I'm not crazy,

524
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:27,941
that my brother
wasn't crazy.

525
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:29,943
She had the same
dream, will.

526
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:31,945
Officer: Will rollins!
Mark Davis!

527
00:30:32,013 --> 00:30:34,514
[Bell rings]

528
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:43,790
Mark: This doesn't make
any sense.

529
00:30:43,858 --> 00:30:45,225
There's nothing
on Krueger.

530
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:46,293
Not his arrest,
his death,

531
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,295
not even
a birth certificate.

532
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:51,064
Whole sections of
the records are gone.

533
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:54,301
Look at all these
blacked-out obituaries.

534
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:05,745
January 18th.
That's the day

535
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:07,447
my brother
committed suicide.

536
00:31:07,514 --> 00:31:09,382
Why isn't that
in here?

537
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:14,187
I don't know!

538
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:16,456
But I'm sure there's
a good reason.

539
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:19,525
I mean, remember in group
when they told us

540
00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:20,927
not to jump
to conclusions.

541
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:22,595
Listen to yourself.
You're holding onto

542
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:23,997
that psychobabble
bullshit

543
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:26,599
like it's some kind of
security blanket, man.

544
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:30,270
Let it go. They covered
him up, will.

545
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:31,738
They never told us
about Freddy

546
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:33,673
because that's how they
decided to beat him.

547
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:36,609
They treated him like he
was a fucking disease,

548
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:37,677
and they locked up
all the kids

549
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:38,678
who had made
contact with him

550
00:31:38,746 --> 00:31:40,446
so they wouldn't
infect the others.

551
00:31:40,514 --> 00:31:44,184
That's crazy?
Is it?

552
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:46,486
How come
we were never allowed

553
00:31:46,553 --> 00:31:48,989
to call any of
our friends, man?

554
00:31:49,056 --> 00:31:51,424
How come none of our
friends ever called us?

555
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,494
We were in a fucking
quarantine, man.

556
00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:56,997
That's what
westin hills was for.

557
00:31:57,064 --> 00:31:59,465
Will: Well, even if all
you're saying is true,

558
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,834
then why didn't
Freddy kill Lori?

559
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:04,437
Maybe he's not
strong enough yet.

560
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,671
My brother said
it's our fear

561
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:07,107
that gives him
his power.

562
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:08,474
Yeah, well,
you sure as hell

563
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:11,011
spread enough fear
today at school.

564
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:12,946
Holy shit.

565
00:32:17,718 --> 00:32:18,651
You're right.

566
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:19,652
They wanted
to forget Freddy

567
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,587
so they wouldn't
fear him--

568
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:25,691
what if I screwed up
the town's plan?

569
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:26,726
No.

570
00:32:26,794 --> 00:32:28,594
Fuck! This fucker's
gonna spread

571
00:32:28,662 --> 00:32:30,363
like the plague, man.
Kids are gonna start

572
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:32,832
falling asleep,
it's gonna--

573
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,301
let's leave, man,
let's leave right now.

574
00:32:34,368 --> 00:32:35,302
No, I can't leave.

575
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:36,502
Why not?

576
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,471
I gotta go talk to Lori.
I gotta see if she's ok.

577
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,806
Well, is she worth
dying for?

578
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:41,141
Because if you
fall asleep,

579
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:42,375
you ain't waking up.

580
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:43,376
Yeah, well,
if that's the case,

581
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:45,711
how come
you're not dead?

582
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:46,947
Or any of the freaks
at westin, huh?

583
00:32:47,014 --> 00:32:50,216
When's the last time
you even had a nightmare?

584
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:51,751
I don't know.

585
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:55,221
I can't remember
my dreams anymore.

586
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:58,291
Look, just give me
one night, ok?

587
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,161
Just let me find Lori,
and then we're out of here.

588
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:04,664
I swear.

589
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,234
All right. If your
ass isn't back here

590
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:10,837
by dawn, I'm gone.
We clear on that?

591
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,340
This baby's
my brother's

592
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,775
pride and joy,
so be careful.

[Techno music playing]

594
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,609
Oh, shit.

595
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:50,643

596
00:33:50,711 --> 00:33:53,646
Uh, shack,
I don't drink.

[All laughing]

598
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,602
Hi, Lori. Didn't think
I'd see you here.

599
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,338
Uh, can I get you
something to drink?

600
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:20,173
Smooth opening,
but, you know,

601
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:22,008
we're already
taken care of.

602
00:34:22,076 --> 00:34:24,377
What happened
to your clothes?

603
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:26,513
Oh, this. Uh...

604
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,780
I was playing
a drinking game

605
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:31,017
with some of the, uh,
lower primates,

606

for my ability

to read above
a fourth grade level.

608
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:35,988
Linderman, you know,
I always pictured you

609
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:38,525
as a straight up
bed wetter.

610
00:34:38,592 --> 00:34:40,527
You know what, Kia?

611
00:34:40,594 --> 00:34:42,028
I used to think
you hated me

612
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:43,796
because you thought I wasn't
good enough for Lori,

613
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:46,533
but that's not it.
You see, you tear me down

614
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,567
to make yourself
feel better

615
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:48,801
because you really
hate yourself,

616
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,537
which is kind of pathetic
when you actually

617
00:34:50,604 --> 00:34:51,737
stop and think about it,
assuming, of course,

618
00:34:51,805 --> 00:34:53,606
you can think
with all that make-up

619

weighing down
your head.

The cops said Blake
committed suicide.

621

Apparently, it was
grief over Trey.

No, man,
that's bullshit.

623

I heard
some guy Krueger

624
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:08,521
killed them both.

625
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:09,522
Said his name
to my parents,

626

they almost shit
themselves.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, man,

that Freddy freak,
he used to live here.

629

Fucking gutted Trey like
a goddamn Turkey, man.

Like I heard
his intestines and shit

looking at?

Come on, come on,

Come on, Linderman,
let's go.

Where have
you been, will?

639
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,196
Didn't you get
my letters?

640
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:51,598
What letters?

641
00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:54,601
They must've never
even mailed them. Heh!

642
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:57,604
Who?

643
00:35:57,671 --> 00:36:01,807
The...Doctors at
westin hills.

644
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,379
I've been in
a psychiatric hospital.

645
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:07,880
Uh, mark was
with me there.

646
00:36:07,948 --> 00:36:10,683
Some other kids, too.

647
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,619
I don't understand.

648
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:16,689
Well, I saw on the news
the other night,

649
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,824
I mean, that kid that was
killed at your house.

650
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:21,628

819
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,075
So you knew about will
this whole time.

820
00:47:10,143 --> 00:47:13,879
Lori, listen to me.

821
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:18,250
You're upset.
We both are.

822
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:19,919
Now I think
what you need now

823
00:47:19,986 --> 00:47:23,222
more than anything
is to get some rest.

824
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,924
Why don't I give you
some pills,

825
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:26,625
and that'll
help you sleep,

826
00:47:26,693 --> 00:47:29,561
and then we talk
about it in the morning?

827
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:31,030
I don't want
to sleep, dad!

828
00:47:31,097 --> 00:47:33,165
I want to know why
you've been lying to me!

829
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:34,266
We'll talk about it
in the morning!

830
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:36,035
Now do what I say!

831
00:47:36,102 --> 00:47:39,205
Lori! Lori!

832
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:40,239
Lori!

833
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:44,310
Open this door.
Open this door!

834
00:47:44,377 --> 00:47:45,744
Go away!

835
00:47:45,812 --> 00:47:46,745
Dr. Campbell:
Damn it, Lori!

836
00:47:46,813 --> 00:47:48,413
Let me in !

837
00:47:48,481 --> 00:47:49,681

00:47:54,487 --> 00:47:55,487
Goddamn it!

839

Aah!

842
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,479
It's ok, it's me.
It's me, shh! Shh!

843
00:48:20,546 --> 00:48:22,647
You ok?
Are you ok?

844
00:48:22,715 --> 00:48:24,816
It's me, all right?

845
00:48:24,885 --> 00:48:28,220
Will: I don't know
how your father's

846

connected to all this,

847
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:30,990
but I think
mark was right.

848
00:48:31,057 --> 00:48:31,991
There's some kind
of cover-up

849
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:33,759
going on here
with Krueger.

850
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:38,063
We can't trust
the police.

851
00:48:39,866 --> 00:48:41,433
We can't trust
any of the adults.

852
00:48:43,937 --> 00:48:45,337
So what do we do?

853
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:47,139
We gotta get
to mark.

854
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:49,074
He's the expert
in all of this.

855
00:48:49,142 --> 00:48:50,109
He'll know
what's going on.

for me, bro.

Hey, mark.

You didn't forget
about me, did you?

867
00:50:19,532 --> 00:50:20,866
Oh, God.

[Freddy's voice]
Oh, that's right!

Everyone forgot!

870
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:26,771
That's why they weren't
afraid anymore!

871
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:28,307
That's why I needed Jason
to kill for me

872
00:50:28,375 --> 00:50:30,442
to get them to remember.

873

I need you to send
a little message for me.

That's all,
just a little message.

Mark: I'm not
gonna do it.

No?!

I won't do it.
[Sniffles]

I'll have to pass
that message myself.

[Sighs]

904
00:52:21,521 --> 00:52:24,689
Uh, sheriff,
I've been compiling info

905
00:52:24,757 --> 00:52:26,425
based on eyewitness reports
of the hockey mask killer.

906
00:52:26,493 --> 00:52:28,193
We already know
who did this.

907
00:52:28,261 --> 00:52:30,962
Sheriff, we closed
down the school

908
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,164
and set up a curfew
for anyone under 18.

909
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,165
Good.

910
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,966
Now I want 24 hour
roadblocks set up.

911
00:52:35,034 --> 00:52:36,602
Nobody leaves town,
nobody gets in.

912
00:52:36,669 --> 00:52:38,170
We're gonna contain
this son of a bitch

913
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,404
before he spreads
any further.

914
00:52:39,472 --> 00:52:41,940
Yes, sir.

915
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:43,742
Sir, shouldn't we have
the FBI come in and--

916
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:45,977
no outsiders, Stubbs.

917
00:52:46,045 --> 00:52:48,280
We can handle this.
We've stopped him before.

918
00:52:48,348 --> 00:52:50,549
Ok, I'm a little
lost here.

919
00:52:50,617 --> 00:52:52,284
Stopped who before?

920
00:52:52,352 --> 00:52:55,220
We don't say
his name out loud.

921
00:52:55,288 --> 00:52:57,189
You're not
from around here.

922

I don't expect you
to understand.

With all due resect,
sheriff,

924
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,926
I think
we have a copycat

925
00:53:01,994 --> 00:53:03,595
of the old
Jason Voorhess

926

00:53:04,697 --> 00:53:06,565
you listen to me.
We do things around here

928
00:53:06,633 --> 00:53:08,133
a certain way
for a reason.

929
00:53:08,201 --> 00:53:10,536
And that's given us
4 years of peace.

930
00:53:10,603 --> 00:53:12,638
So you either do your job
and keep your mouth shut

931
00:53:12,705 --> 00:53:14,873
or, so help me God,
I will lock you up!

we all just leave?

00:53:34,093 --> 00:53:36,495
No, even if we leave,

938
00:53:36,563 --> 00:53:38,797
Freddy can still get us.

939
00:53:38,864 --> 00:53:42,167
We all know about him,
we're all afraid of him.

940
00:53:44,437 --> 00:53:48,740
It was our fear that
gave him his power.

941
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,376
We're marked now.

942
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:53,545
Man,
screw that clown.

943
00:53:53,613 --> 00:53:54,879
I mean, what kind
of a pussy comes

944
00:53:54,947 --> 00:53:56,981
after you in
your dreams anyway?

945
00:53:57,049 --> 00:53:58,317
Now that big ass
mother fucker

946
00:53:58,384 --> 00:53:59,851
back at the cornfield,

947
00:53:59,919 --> 00:54:01,853
all right, that's who
we should be afraid of.

948
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:04,189
Tell me who
the fuck that was.

949
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:06,358
His name was
Jason Voorhess.

950
00:54:06,426 --> 00:54:09,628
Uh, shit, man...
Um...

951
00:54:09,696 --> 00:54:12,598
How'd you know
we were here?

952
00:54:12,665 --> 00:54:15,200
Nothing personal,
but the Scooby van out back

953
00:54:15,268 --> 00:54:17,269
wasn't exactly subtle.

954
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,070
And never keep
your keys in the door.

955
00:54:19,138 --> 00:54:21,573
Great, so now we're
completely fucked.

956
00:54:21,641 --> 00:54:23,508
No, you're not.

957
00:54:23,576 --> 00:54:26,111
I'm here to help you.

958
00:54:26,178 --> 00:54:29,147
Now, this Jason Voorhess
supposedly drowned

959
00:54:29,215 --> 00:54:31,216
at camp crystal lake
back in 1957

960
00:54:31,284 --> 00:54:32,984
when he was
11 years old.

961
00:54:33,052 --> 00:54:35,820
The counselors weren't
watching him,

962
00:54:35,888 --> 00:54:39,324
then they made the mistake
of killing his mother.

963
00:54:39,392 --> 00:54:42,227
The legend has it
that Jason kept returning

964
00:54:42,295 --> 00:54:43,495
from his grave to punish

965
00:54:43,563 --> 00:54:45,230
whoever returned
to the camp.

966
00:54:45,298 --> 00:54:48,166
I think we're dealing
with a copycat here.

967
00:54:48,234 --> 00:54:49,801
No. No. No, no, no.

968
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,336
He's not a copycat.

969
00:54:51,404 --> 00:54:53,004
I've seen what he can do.
He's the real Jason.

970
00:54:53,072 --> 00:54:55,340
That's impossible, Linderman.
Jason is dead.

971
00:54:55,408 --> 00:54:57,609
Yeah. Well, you'd better
start thinking outside

972
00:54:57,677 --> 00:54:59,043
your little box, dude.

973
00:54:59,111 --> 00:55:00,211
'Cause somebody's
definitely breaking

the fucking
reality rules, ok?

975
00:55:02,448 --> 00:55:03,682
Will: It makes
sense in a way.

976
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:07,252
I mean, what if Freddy
brought Jason back

977
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,554
because he was too weak
to go after us on his own,

978
00:55:09,622 --> 00:55:12,357
so he used Jason.

979
00:55:12,425 --> 00:55:14,259
I mean, he knew that
we'd think it was him,

980
00:55:14,327 --> 00:55:15,827
