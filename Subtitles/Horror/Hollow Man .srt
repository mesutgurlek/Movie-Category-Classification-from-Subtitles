1
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:40,796
Damn it!

2
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,315
Damn it.

3
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,914
I am a goddamn genius.

4
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:16,679
Oh, my God.

5
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:26,270
Sebastian, do you have any idea
what time it is?

6
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:29,439
Da Vinci never slept.
Said it was a waste of time.

7
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:31,115
Who's that?

8
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:34,350
Not your business.

9
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:38,070
Not anymore.

10
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:40,990
Linda...

11
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,075
...I cracked the reversion.

12
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:46,630
You cracked it?

13
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:47,910
Look at this.

14
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,510
Watch.

15
00:05:56,401 --> 00:06:01,316
Eleven months and you suddenly come up
with it out of the blue? How?

16
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:04,275
The usual. Coffee and Twinkies.

17
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:06,199
I hate you.

18
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:10,314
Can you find Matt and get to the lab?
I want Isabelle for a live test.

19
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:12,234
I think I can find him.

20
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:13,476
When will you be in?

21
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:16,070
Well, it should be daylight
in Sweden now.

22
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:21,190
So I should call the Nobel committee
and tell them to get our prize ready.

23
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,958
I'll see you in a few.

24
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,630
Matt.

25
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:34,191
Sebastian called.
We gotta get to the lab.

26
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:36,198
What's the rush?

27
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,476
He cracked reversion.

28
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:38,876
You're kidding.

29
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,754
- When?
- While we were sleeping.

30
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,714
You want a ride?

31
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:48,637
Maybe we should take our own cars.

32
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,675
I'm tired of this
sneaking around, Lin.

33
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:53,872
You're gonna have to tell him
eventually.

34
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:56,510
I will, eventually.

35
00:06:56,721 --> 00:06:58,552
I'm just waiting for the right time.

36
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:04,071
With Sebastian, there's never
gonna be a right time.

37
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:23,718
But you were meant to die

38
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:28,195
'Cause I was made to fly

39
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:49,470
Morning, Dr. Caine.

40
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:51,797
- Have a nice day, sir.
- Thank you.

41
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,514
- Good morning, sir.
- Hi, Ed.

42
00:08:12,721 --> 00:08:15,030
Your team's in early today.
Something special?

43
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:17,630
Sorry, Ed. You know the rules.

44
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:27,711
- Authorization, please.
- Caine, 0027.

45
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,149
Confirmed.

46
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:04,274
Isabelle.

47
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:28,876
Come on, Isabelle.

48
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:31,319
Calm down, baby.

49
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:36,154
Good girl.

50
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,314
It's okay.

51
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:50,519
I'm not going to hurt you.

52
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:53,914
Hold still.

53
00:10:19,681 --> 00:10:20,670
Isabelle?

54
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,837
She's more aggressive these days.

55
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,437
That's what tranquillizers are for.
I'll get her.

56
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:30,720
She's been gone too long.
It's starting to affect her brain.

57
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,350
- You take care of that bite.
- I'll manage.

58
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:40,397
Ten bucks says I nail her first.

59
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:41,909
You're on.

60
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:55,317
Daddy's got a surprise for you.

61
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:14,034
You missed.

62
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:17,159
Maybe because I don't spend
my lunch hours practising.

63
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:21,316
You owe me ten.

64
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:23,675
Put it on my tab.

65
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:28,154
You know, someday I may actually
make you pay up.

66
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:34,715
Sarah's on the warpath,
so you play nice.

67
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:38,834
- This is bullshit, Sebastian.
- And good morning to you too.

68
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,754
Get the monkey on the table.

69
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:45,233
How can you justify injecting Isabelle
with the serum without even testing it?

70
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:46,709
Because it'll save time.

71
00:11:46,921 --> 00:11:48,593
Then you can mop up afterwards.

72
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:50,996
You think I'm trying to kill Isabelle?

73
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:54,193
- Kill? More like liquefy.
- Lab's prepped.

74
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:58,315
Well, your objections are duly noted
and summarily overruled.

75
00:11:58,521 --> 00:11:59,920
Yes, sir.

76
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:04,997
How come when you say, "Yes, sir,"
it sounds like "Fuck you"?

77
00:12:05,601 --> 00:12:06,636
Practise.

78
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:09,711
How'd you convince me to hire her?

79
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,758
You wanted the best vet in the U.S.

80
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:16,153
- She cares more about the animals.
- And maybe that's why she's so good.

81
00:12:17,401 --> 00:12:19,710
So this guy you're seeing,
what's he like?

82
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:21,639
He's everything you're not.

83
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:24,234
He must be dull.

84
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:45,836
- Ready in 40.
- Okay.

85
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,520
Vitals?

86
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,557
All normal.

87
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:52,150
Using the word "normal" loosely,
of course.

88
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:55,359
- Emergency medical, standing by.
- Tech, status?

89
00:12:55,561 --> 00:12:56,880
This is God.

90
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:59,515
You are disturbing the natural
order of things...

91
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:02,838
...and will be severely punished
for all eternity.

92
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:04,679
God has spoken.

93
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:07,197
How many times must
I tell you, Frank...

94
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,154
...you're not God.

95
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:10,990
I am.

96
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:14,199
Sorry, chief. Forgot.

97
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:16,040
You guys ready to roll yet?

98
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,310
Yes.

99
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,396
Like those sorry-ass M.D. s
have ever had to wait for us.

100
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,395
Tell His Highness
Mary was hot two hours ago.

101
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,313
Yeah, I'll tell him that.

102
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:28,791
- Ready up here, chief.
- Roll and record.

103
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:29,831
Rolling.

104
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:34,993
Subject, Isabelle Two.
Currently in phase-shift, 126 hours.

105
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:40,919
Testing D-phase protocol...

106
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:44,631
...Serial Irradiated Protein Caine 125.

107
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:47,913
Stop naming them after yourself,
you'd have better luck.

108
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,959
Thank you, Dr. Kensington,
for that keen observation.

109
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:52,714
I'll include it in my memoirs.

110
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:55,276
I'll make sure to put you in mine.

111
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:58,314
Would you guys be serious, please?

112
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:02,273
- You think she'll make it?
- I don't know, I just work here.

113
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:04,517
Quantum signatures are calibrated.

114
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:07,796
Okay, Sarah, get us a vein.

115
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:14,716
Spray.

116
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:21,956
Vein's prepped.

117
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:24,794
All right.

118
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:27,954
Here goes nothing.

119
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:30,676
Bad form, Matthew. The honour is mine.

120
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:52,555
Injection occurred at 0847.

121
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:08,519
Elevated heartbeat.

122
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,952
- We're still in the green.
- Confirmed.

123
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:17,871
Bioelectric energy and quantum
shift indicators are stable.

124
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,240
We're getting cellular reaction.

125
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,831
It's working. It's actually working.

126
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,477
- Of course it is.
- Don't get cocky.

127
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:48,510
Heart rate's up. She's scared.
It's okay.

128
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:53,073
Subject began manifesting immediately.
Protocol's acting quickly.

129
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,834
Goddamn it, blood pressure crashing.
Pulse high.

130
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:05,916
It's her heart.

131
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:11,355
I got erratic heartbeat
and brain activity.

132
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:14,195
- She's going into cardiac arrest.
- Defib!

133
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:16,119
Prep an intracardiac.

134
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:24,239
- Flatline. We're losing her.
- No, we're not. Hit her!

135
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:25,670
Clear!

136
00:16:27,841 --> 00:16:29,274
- Again.
- Clear.

137
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:33,590
- Again!
- Clear.

138
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:35,911
- Come on.
- Again!

139
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,230
Clear!

140
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:39,840
Fuck! Intracardiac.

141
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:42,919
Wait! No, we got something.

142
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:50,192
Still erratic...

143
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:52,153
...and stabilizing.

144
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:35,154
Oh, man.

145
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:39,913
Brain activity returning to normal.
Quantum signatures are stable.

146
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,352
Welcome back, Isabelle.

147
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,279
Yeah, baby!

148
00:17:52,161 --> 00:17:53,958
- We did it.
- Good work, everyone.

149
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:56,157
Yeah! That's the way it's done, man.

150
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:58,517
So how's she doing, doc?

151
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:02,716
Well, I think she's going to be okay.

152
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:10,790
- Come on. Right in there.
- Come on, Isabelle.

153
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:13,356
Go ahead. Good girl.

154
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:16,954
Look how peaceful she is.

155
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,152
It seems like nothing happened to her.

156
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:23,440
Schedule a vivisection for Monday.
I want to check her neuropathways.

157
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:26,479
You just brought her back
and you're gonna slice up her brain?

158
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:28,512
I'm not running a goddamn zoo!

159
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,272
- You're a fucking unethical bastard.
- Tell her you're kidding.

160
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:34,597
- Right?
- Right.

161
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:36,553
I won't cut her for another week.

162
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:39,239
Don't be such an asshole.

163
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:41,711
We finally have something
to celebrate.

164
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,151
- Cool. I'm hungry, let's go.
- Me too.

165
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:47,318
We should cut you up.

166
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:52,312
Ladies and gentlemen,
a moment of your time, please.

167
00:18:52,521 --> 00:18:53,510
Here it comes.

168
00:18:53,721 --> 00:18:56,713
To the finest research team
I have ever known.

169
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:58,115
Cheers.

170
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:08,359
There was a big explosion,
and afterward she said:

171
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:12,833
"If you're so smart, how come
you're still in the second grade?"

172
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:15,720
- She grew her eyebrows back?
- In a month.

173
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,991
- How long were you suspended?
- A month.

174
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:36,912
I thought you'd gone.

175
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:38,839
There's nowhere to go.

176
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:43,119
Did I miss something?

177
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:45,671
Aren't you supposed to be happy?

178
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:50,392
Reversion was the last breakthrough.
Feels like the beginning of the end.

179
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:53,559
That's not true.
We've got a lifetime of data.

180
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:57,760
Matt has the patience to crunch
the numbers, but you know me...

181
00:19:58,001 --> 00:20:01,516
...I need this grandeur
and the spectacle.

182
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:04,315
I can't concern myself
with the details.

183
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:07,674
Yeah, I know. I was one of them.

184
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:14,074
I thought we were great together.

185
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,870
You were great.

186
00:20:17,921 --> 00:20:20,071
I was just standing next to you.

187
00:20:21,241 --> 00:20:25,154
Come on. We had some good times.

188
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:27,318
Yeah, we had some good times.

189
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:33,315
Have you ever wanted to
turn the clock back?

190
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:36,273
Go back and try again?

191
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:41,270
I'd say that kind of time travel
doesn't exist.

192
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:45,231
Well, maybe we should invent it.

193
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:03,195
Or not.

194
00:21:41,721 --> 00:21:43,313
What's it like?

195
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:57,110
Four years ago, this committee
gave me...

196
00:21:57,361 --> 00:21:59,272
...a very specific
and challenging task...

197
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:02,075
...to phase-shift a human being
out of quantum sync...

198
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,158
...with the visible universe...

199
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:06,591
...and return him safely
with no aftereffects.

200
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:10,437
We found that sending them
to never-never land was easy.

201
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,317
It's the getting them back
that's hard.

202
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:27,271
Primary DNA strands decaying on you?

203
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:29,517
Along with cellular bond instability.

204
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:31,639
How have you solved the problem?

205
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:33,950
I haven't.

206
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:38,439
But we're close.

207
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:43,039
We just need more time.

208
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:57,279
Ever since you walked in my class
your freshman year...

209
00:22:57,481 --> 00:22:59,153
...I knew you were different.

210
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:02,273
Over the years, your genius
has been most impressive.

211
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:04,115
Thank you, Dr. Kramer.

212
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:05,800
Well, don't thank me yet.

213
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:09,840
This committee has given you
remarkable leeway.

214
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:14,478
We've tolerated your eccentricities,
as well as your need for privacy.

215
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:18,799
And I assure you,
our patience is running out.

216
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:21,276
If we don't get results
and get them soon...

217
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:24,315
...your genius will cease
to impress me.

218
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,712
And if you can't make it work...

219
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:30,152
...I'll find another
Sebastian Caine who can.

220
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:33,554
- What just happened in there?
- This better be good.

221
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:36,434
- I wasn't ready for them to know.
- You weren't ready?

222
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:39,354
Being ready's not it.
You have results, you report them.

223
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:42,155
- Can I explain?
- You just lied to the Pentagon!

224
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:44,312
Once they know we've completed it...

225
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:47,115
...what's to stop them from
taking over the project?

226
00:23:47,321 --> 00:23:49,915
- Why would they?
- Because they won't need us.

227
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:52,840
But it's their project.
It's gonna happen sometime.

228
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:55,839
It may be their project,
but it's my dream, my vision.

229
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:59,437
- What are you proposing?
- That we go to Phase Three ourselves.

230
00:23:59,681 --> 00:24:01,273
Phase Three? Are you nuts?

231
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,712
You can't jump into human testing.
There's rules, procedures.

232
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,673
You don't make history with rules.
You make it by seizing the moment.

233
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:14,438
You want to be the first one.
That's what this is about.

234
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:19,199
This is not about me, it's about us.
We said we would change the world.

235
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:23,073
Now is our chance.

236
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:26,996
How did you get clearance
for Phase Three?

237
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:29,881
- I volunteered. They approved.
- No way.

238
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:31,520
You're kidding.

239
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:35,875
You volunteered? Are you insane?

240
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:41,840
Jonas Salk tested the polio vaccine
on himself. Was he insane?

241
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,918
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was.

242
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:45,914
Shit.

243
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:50,913
In the past four weeks, we have
brought back seven primates.

244
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:54,796
- The results speak for themselves.
- Or do you want to believe that?

245
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:59,472
Sarah, I thought you'd be happy.
We are giving the animals a break.

246
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:07,080
Moving this fast is bad science,
no matter who the guinea pig is.

247
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:11,559
- I can't believe they approved this.
- I think it's fucking cool.

248
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:12,950
You would.

249
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:16,034
If we're to move forward,
this is the next logical step.

250
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:22,831
I'll stay shifted for 3 days and then
we'll perform a quantum reversion.

251
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:23,917
Fuck, yes.

252
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:26,032
Can I count on your best work?

253
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:31,956
Good.

254
00:25:40,001 --> 00:25:42,151
How did we let him talk us into this?

255
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:45,392
Can we talk about it later?

256
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:47,557
I'm trying to make love to you.

257
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:50,356
We're risking our professional
lives here.

258
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:54,114
Yes, Matt, I realize.

259
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,118
Then why did we agree to it?

260
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,270
Because maybe we both know that
Sebastian can pull it off.

261
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:07,720
- Let me ask another question.
- Is it about who's gonna be on top?

262
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:13,754
Ever miss being with him?

263
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,359
Why do you ask that?

264
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:20,711
Because he sets the bar pretty high.

265
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,712
Let me tell you a little secret.

266
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:30,154
The concept of Sebastian
is much more appealing...

267
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:32,357
...than Sebastian himself.

268
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:38,834
We're ready for you.

269
00:26:42,961 --> 00:26:44,360
See you later.

270
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:50,476
- It's not too late to stop.
- I thought I was the nervous one.

271
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:54,634
- We have a lot riding on this.
- Hear about Superman and Wonder Woman?

272
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:56,832
- Stop clowning around.
- It's a good one.

273
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:59,117
Superman is flying over Metropolis.

274
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:01,471
He's horny and checking out
the rooftops.

275
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:05,959
He sees Wonder Woman sunning herself
on the roof of the Justice League.

276
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:10,632
She's lying there buck-naked, spread-
eagle, wanting to be fucked, right?

277
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:12,314
Superman says to himself:

278
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:14,756
"I gotta get myself
some Wonder pussy."

279
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:18,710
Then he realizes that he could
fly down, do a little fast pumping...

280
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:21,754
...and be gone before she knew,
since he's Superman.

281
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:23,838
Faster than a speeding bullet.

282
00:27:24,081 --> 00:27:27,517
He swoops down, he fucks her so quick,
she doesn't even see him.

283
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:32,118
Wonder Woman sits up, says,
"What the fuck was that?"

284
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:34,955
And the Invisible Man says,
"I don't know...

285
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:38,079
...but my asshole is killing me."

286
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:42,957
That's funny, right?
Come on, guys. That's funny.

287
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:02,711
Ladies, please. This is science.

288
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,159
Starting IV drip.

289
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:17,393
- Okay, how are you feeling?
- I'm a little tense.

290
00:28:17,601 --> 00:28:20,911
Pulse 88. BP 140l95.
It's a bit elevated.

291
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,713
I wonder why.

292
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:24,710
Are you sure?

293
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:26,555
Positive.

294
00:28:27,881 --> 00:28:29,633
- We ready up in heaven?
- Ready.

295
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:32,470
Mary's rolling.

296
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:35,639
I just hope we're not making
a snuff film. Rolling.

297
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:38,231
If it is, I got dibs on his Porsche.

298
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:40,472
Janice, how can you say that?

299
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:41,916
Sorry.

300
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:43,993
Porsche is mine.

301
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:47,797
Subject male, age 38,
weight 166 pounds.

302
00:28:51,761 --> 00:28:53,479
Serum's irradiated.

303
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:56,154
- This better work.
- It will.

304
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:58,716
- Oh, yeah?
- You want to bet on it?

305
00:28:58,921 --> 00:29:01,355
If I win, you won't be around
to pay off, so, no.

306
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:02,590
Are you ready?

307
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:06,432
I'll do it. So if anything
goes wrong, you can't be blamed.

308
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,030
All right.

309
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:14,995
Any last words?

310
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:19,238
Yeah. If I die, pretend I said
something deep and clever.

311
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,990
Injection administered at 1823.

312
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:54,318
- Are you feeling anything?
- Nothing so far.

313
00:29:57,601 --> 00:29:59,796
- Vitals are stable.
- Nothing's happening.

314
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:02,435
Human DNA structure
may take more time.

315
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:04,199
- You pulsed it right?
- Yes.

316
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:06,915
Recheck the radiation.
It can't be non-reactive.

317
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:09,555
No change in bioelectric activity.

318
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:10,911
Goddamn it!

319
00:30:11,481 --> 00:30:14,473
- I'll repeat the protocol, okay?
- Wait.

320
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:19,115
I'm starting to feel something.

321
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:22,597
It's my arm. It's...

322
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,639
It's getting warm.

323
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:29,239
Okay, it's starting to tingle.

324
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:34,512
Yeah, it's moving down into my back.

325
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:41,790
Here we go.

326
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:53,156
Shit! It hurts.

327
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:55,514
It's tearing me.

328
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:59,437
Heartbeat's elevated.
Pulse at 110. 130.

329
00:31:05,761 --> 00:31:08,400
Christ, didn't think it
would hurt so much.

330
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:09,910
Frank, readouts!

331
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:13,079
Brain waves are spiking.
He's on the verge of a seizure.

332
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,958
Pulse is 165, 170.
Blood pressure 180 over 110.

333
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:22,072
Sebastian, can you hear me?

334
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:30,237
- His heart'll blow out!
- Standby paddles!

335
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:31,709
Coming in.

336
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:39,317
Subcellular quantum. He's shifting.

337
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:41,477
Bioelectric in the red.

338
00:31:42,721 --> 00:31:43,710
Wait.

339
00:31:44,121 --> 00:31:45,440
He's going.

340
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,869
Pulse is 180.

341
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:52,799
Holding stable.

342
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:11,316
Holy shit.

343
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:20,720
Pulse is dropping. 170, 160, 150.

344
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:43,510
Bio-quantum phase-shift
occurred at 1826.

345
00:32:45,001 --> 00:32:45,990
Is he okay?

346
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:49,432
Yeah, he's in bioelectric shock.
Passed out from the trauma.

347
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:51,000
Vitals returning to normal?

348
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,840
Pulse 110, dropping.
Blood pressure's 130l75.

349
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:57,073
- Quantum readings normal.
- E lectrical activity is stabilizing.

350
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,436
Something to tell the grandkids.

351
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:08,631
Pulse steady at 85.

352
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:13,671
You did it. You're the first.

353
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:49,834
It's okay.

354
00:33:50,521 --> 00:33:52,113
You nodded off.

355
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:56,234
- His breathing's hypnotic.
- Yeah.

356
00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:58,919
How long has it been?

357
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:00,876
Seventeen hours.

358
00:34:01,281 --> 00:34:04,876
And we already have enough data
for two lifetimes of research.

359
00:34:05,281 --> 00:34:06,794
It's a brave new world, Lin.

360
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:14,120
I keep looking at that hole,
wondering if he's really there.

361
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:17,833
- Did you see that?
- Sebastian, can you hear me?

362
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:21,876
Christ! The lights!
Turn off the goddamn lights!

363
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:26,874
I can't close my eyes.

364
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:29,470
You can, but your eyelids
are transparent.

365
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:33,999
It's weird. I feel the same,
but I'm not here.

366
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,240
You're here.

367
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:47,830
I'm right here.

368
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,997
- Where?
- At the mirror.

369
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:52,319
Looking at myself.

370
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:58,114
Or, rather, not looking at myself.

371
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:04,037
Hey, how's he doing?

372
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:06,072
Why don't you ask Sebastian?

373
00:35:06,921 --> 00:35:10,152
- How do you feel?
- Oh, not too bad, considering.

374
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:17,193
Just want to set the mood.

375
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:20,672
It's the light.
His eyelids are transparent.

376
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:23,912
So, what's it like being a ghost?

377
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:27,193
Ghosts are dead. I'm very much alive.

378
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:28,675
Come on, don't be a dick.

379
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:30,837
Sorry. I couldn't resist.

380
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:34,397
Okay, now I feel like
we're playing Marco Polo.

381
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:37,552
I wonder where he is now.

382
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:41,271
Well, I see the procedure's
not changed your personality.

383
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:45,111
- He just brushed by me.
- No worries, I'm on it.

384
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:50,072
- Do you see anything?
- Where is he?

385
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,714
You got him?

386
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:56,080
Got you, chief.

387
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:59,517
You guys have no sense of fun.

388
00:36:00,161 --> 00:36:01,719
Shit. Oh, my God.

389
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:05,880
I've arranged for one of us to be
here 24l7, if you need anything.

390
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,960
The team's gonna be on alpha-call
alert, so we can be here within...

391
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:14,035
30 minutes. I know.
I wrote the procedure, remember?

392
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:18,117
I was reassuring you. There's
a thermal camera for observation.

393
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:20,511
- She likes this, doesn't she?
- What?

394
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,195
- Being in charge.
- Oh, yeah. She loves it.

395
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:25,910
It's about time the shoe
was on the other foot.

396
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:28,076
Well, just remember.

397
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:31,317
It's still my project.

398
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:43,914
- You okay taking the late shift?
- It's not like I have a social life.

399
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,874
I know. The workaholic's curse.

400
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,675
Carter's gonna be in by 6
to spell you.

401
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:51,951
I'm here at 8.
Call me if you need to.

402
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:53,954
I'll be fine. Get some sleep.

403
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:55,913
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

404
00:37:59,161 --> 00:38:00,150
Are you awake?

405
00:38:46,521 --> 00:38:48,113
Sebastian?

406
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:55,039
Are you in here?

407
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,393
I know you're in here.

408
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:19,001
- So how was your first night?
- Restless.

409
00:39:19,201 --> 00:39:21,396
Hard to sleep without
closing your eyes.

410
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:22,590
What'd you do?

411
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:25,713
Got up a couple of times.
Walked around.

412
00:39:25,921 --> 00:39:28,037
Sarah mentioned you weren't
in your room.

413
00:39:28,281 --> 00:39:29,714
I got a cup of coffee.

414
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:33,391
In the future, you want to tell
the on-call where you're going...

415
00:39:33,601 --> 00:39:35,717
...just in case something
happens to you.

416
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:38,833
I'm touched by your concern,
but it's not a problem.

417
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:40,918
We don't want it to become one.

418
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:43,880
Everything's normal.

419
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:47,278
All right, let's get these off.

420
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:51,909
You okay?

421
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:53,390
Yeah. Why?

422
00:39:54,001 --> 00:39:55,798
You seem a little nervous.

423
00:39:57,801 --> 00:39:59,871
No, I'm fine.

424
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,559
Are you looking at me?

425
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:07,755
No.

426
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:09,670
Why?

427
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,390
No reason.

428
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:25,997
- What was the clientele like?
- This guy comes up to me and he says:

429
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:29,796
"I like my women like my coffee."
People still use that line?

430
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:32,754
- Maybe he meant cold and bitter.
- Very funny.

431
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:35,595
I gotta take a leak.
Keep Carter away from my food.

432
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:38,520
- I'll try, but I can't promise.
- All right.

433
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:18,872
It'd be freaky, but it'd settle down.

434
00:41:19,081 --> 00:41:22,551
No, what would you do if you knew
you couldn't be seen?

435
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:27,113
It gives me the creeps. I can't take
a piss without wearing my thermals.

436
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:30,114
- Like anyone wants to see that.
- How do I know?

437
00:41:30,441 --> 00:41:33,399
Are you asking what we'd do
or what Sebastian would do?

438
00:41:33,601 --> 00:41:34,431
The difference?

439
00:41:34,681 --> 00:41:37,070
There's human nature,
then there's Sebastian.

440
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:39,198
He's always joking that he's God.

441
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:42,114
Imagine what he'd do if
left to his own devices.

442
00:41:42,361 --> 00:41:43,510
Scary thought.

443
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:45,916
- Thankfully, it's almost over.
- Hallelujah.

444
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:49,158
It's just beginning.
You think Sebastian's bad?

445
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:52,154
Imagine if the military
gets their hands on this.

446
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:54,961
Better our military than
someone else's.

447
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:41,592
Sebastian, goddamn it.

448
00:42:42,161 --> 00:42:46,279
You have no idea how much fun this is.
You should try it.

449
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:48,677
I'm sure I'll have my chance.

450
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:55,952
Hey, relax.

451
00:42:56,201 --> 00:43:00,319
It's my last night, so I thought
we'd try one more experiment.

452
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:06,433
Can you guess what this is?

453
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:07,990
What?

454
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:14,719
How did it feel?

455
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:17,958
A little too familiar.

456
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:27,111
Want to know what it's like
to make love to an invisible man?

457
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:30,715
- It'd just be like old times.
- What do you mean?

458
00:43:30,921 --> 00:43:32,479
You were never there.

459
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:34,878
Well, I'm here now.

460
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:37,992
We talked about this once, remember?

461
00:43:38,321 --> 00:43:39,436
What?

462
00:43:39,681 --> 00:43:41,990
You wondered if you'd know
the difference.

463
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:45,635
Sebastian, I do know the difference.

464
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:49,756
It's not what I don't see.
It's what I don't feel.

465
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:52,994
Get some rest.

466
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:54,879
Got a big day tomorrow.

467
00:44:02,321 --> 00:44:03,993
Subject: Dr. Sebastian Caine.

468
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:08,274
Currently in phase-shift
86 hours, 23 minutes.

469
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:12,315
D-phase protocol. Injecting
Serial Protein Caine 127.

470
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:14,517
Irradiation complete.

471
00:44:14,881 --> 00:44:15,870
Set.

472
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,281
- Are you ready?
- Not really.

473
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:22,878
I was starting to enjoy myself.

474
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,713
Well, tough.

475
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,151
We'll see you in a minute, my friend.

476
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:33,919
Injection occurred at 0928.

477
00:44:44,961 --> 00:44:46,280
What are you feeling?

478
00:44:46,881 --> 00:44:49,031
Something's not right.

479
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:57,434
Heartbeat elevated. Frank.

480
00:44:57,681 --> 00:44:59,160
Shift indicators are erratic.

481
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:02,592
- Bioelectric's jumping.
- Check radiation. Crash cart.

482
00:45:04,521 --> 00:45:05,715
What?

483
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:07,434
What's happening?

484
00:45:07,641 --> 00:45:09,791
I can't breathe.

485
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:12,720
- Check his airway.
- His lungs are seized. Intubate.

486
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:17,475
Carter!

487
00:45:21,561 --> 00:45:22,710
Tube him!

488
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:44,519
- He's going into phase-shift.
- Get him on the table.

489
00:45:45,401 --> 00:45:46,311
We lost our signals.

490
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,197
Goddamn!

491
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,515
- Get me an IV of AG-7.
- I'm on it.

492
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,190
No pulse.

493
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:00,440
I've got no pulse!

494
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:02,154
Starting CPR.

495
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:09,990
Don't you die on me.

496
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:13,591
- Don't you fucking die on me.
- I'm getting a pulse.

497
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:20,473
- Sebastian, can you hear me?
- He's going into shock.

498
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:28,160
Jesus.

499
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:36,478
So I guess it didn't work.

500
00:46:36,681 --> 00:46:37,955
No.

501
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:41,878
You look worried. Must've been bad.

502
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:45,555
You almost died.

503
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:48,151
Whatever doesn't kill me
makes me stronger.

504
00:46:48,401 --> 00:46:53,156
Yeah, and ends our careers.
What are we gonna tell Kramer?

505
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:55,434
Nothing.

506
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:57,712
He doesn't need to know yet.

507
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:02,350
- We can't keep lying to the others.
- We don't have a choice.

508
00:47:02,561 --> 00:47:05,121
If I'm gonna be stuck
like this for a while...

509
00:47:05,361 --> 00:47:07,397
...we'll have to make
a few adjustments.

510
00:47:12,281 --> 00:47:13,316
Done.

511
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:17,876
- Open.
- Here.

512
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:43,117
Okay, lift.

513
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:46,154
Carter, get the fan.

514
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:01,559
Okay, don't move.

515
00:48:13,721 --> 00:48:14,517
Don't move.

516
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:21,719
Thanks. That's better.

517
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,750
Here you go.

518
00:48:27,041 --> 00:48:29,839
- It's an improvement.
- You'd almost pass for human.

519
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:33,192
- He couldn't before.
- You have a face you can talk to now.

520
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:35,909
We can all work in normal light again.

521
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:40,078
Let's see if we can't try
to figure out what went wrong.

522
00:48:40,281 --> 00:48:42,556
Before he starts biting people too.

523
00:48:48,601 --> 00:48:50,432
- Goddamn it!
- What?

524
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:52,000
I lost cohesion again.

525
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:54,558
- Are you any closer?
- No.

526
00:48:55,201 --> 00:48:57,669
You know, I can't figure out
the B and C of it.

527
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,316
The B and C?

528
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:04,919
My 5th grade teacher told me that
genius is getting from A to D...

529
00:49:05,121 --> 00:49:07,351
...without having to go
through B and C.

530
00:49:07,761 --> 00:49:09,274
Sebastian can do that.

531
00:49:09,481 --> 00:49:12,951
But me, I gotta have the B and C.

532
00:49:16,201 --> 00:49:18,510
Hold on, Sebastian.
We're almost there.

533
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:22,039
Come on, guys. Out of the way!

534
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:36,157
I can't take much more testing.

535
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:37,550
I know how hard it is.

536
00:49:37,801 --> 00:49:39,951
Bullshit. You don't know anything.

537
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:41,919
This isn't easy for any of us.

538
00:49:42,121 --> 00:49:45,193
Fuck you, Matt! It is easy for you.

539
00:49:46,281 --> 00:49:48,431
I was to be in phase-shift
for three days.

540
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:50,831
It's been 10 fucking days, all right?!

541
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:55,120
Ten days of tissue tests, radiation
tests and your fucking needles!

542
00:49:56,401 --> 00:49:58,835
I can't fucking take it anymore.

543
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:01,436
- What I meant was...
- Fuck what you meant!

544
00:50:01,921 --> 00:50:02,956
And don't ever...

545
00:50:03,161 --> 00:50:05,356
Don't ever tell me
how hard you have it.

546
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:20,839
There she is.

547
00:50:47,641 --> 00:50:50,633
I'd suck the tits right off of you.

548
00:50:51,961 --> 00:50:53,633
Dr. Caine, what's going on?

549
00:50:53,841 --> 00:50:57,117
Just stopped by to let you know
I'm going out for a while.

550
00:50:57,481 --> 00:51:00,200
Wait. Going out?
Hold it a second. Dr. Caine.

551
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:04,390
Dr. Caine.

552
00:51:04,601 --> 00:51:05,954
What do you mean?

553
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:08,157
If I don't get out, I'll go nuts.

554
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:10,716
- You can't leave the compound.
- Why not?

555
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:13,429
- It's the rule.
- It's my rule, I just changed it.

556
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:15,956
- Authorization.
- Caine 0027.

557
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:18,271
- Confirmed.
- You can't just change it.

558
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:21,757
I'm not gonna spend my life
in this godforsaken dump!

559
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:24,515
I'm going out! Be back
in a couple of hours!

560
00:51:24,721 --> 00:51:26,359
Oh, shit!

561
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:37,194
- Hello?
- It's Carter. We got a problem.

562
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:56,521
- How's it going, Ed?
- Hey, doc.

563
00:51:57,601 --> 00:52:01,389
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- You know how it is sometimes.

564
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:02,556
Work, work, work.

565
00:52:02,761 --> 00:52:06,117
I was beginning to worry because
your car hadn't moved.

566
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:08,312
Thanks a lot, Ed.

567
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:10,000
But everything's cool.

568
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,958
Hey, look. Look.

569
00:52:50,161 --> 00:52:53,312
- Look at that.
- Man, he's weird.

570
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,320
- Oh, my God.
- Mommy! Mommy!

571
00:52:56,521 --> 00:52:58,796
- Mommy! Mommy!
- What?

572
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:00,909
- What?
- Look, it's a ghost.

573
00:53:01,121 --> 00:53:04,318
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Mom, it's a ghost.

574
00:53:05,321 --> 00:53:08,916
I'll meet you at the lab.
I'll go by his place just in case.

575
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:10,270
I'll see you there.

576
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:12,120
He could be here.

577
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:15,520
He could be anywhere.

578
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:10,876
Shit.

579
00:54:21,441 --> 00:54:23,397
Don't even think about it.

580
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:31,360
Who's gonna know?

581
00:57:35,721 --> 00:57:37,473
Oh, shit.

582
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:41,871
Matt, it's me. He was here.

583
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,236
No, he took his mask off.

584
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:47,911
He must be outside somewhere.
I don't know where he went.

585
00:57:48,121 --> 00:57:49,873
I'm coming back to the lab.

586
00:57:50,561 --> 00:57:53,758
How? How am I supposed to do that?
I can't fucking see him.

587
00:58:34,521 --> 00:58:36,910
You say you want us to shoot him?
I'm in.

588
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:40,591
It's not a monkey, it's Dr. Caine.
Aren't we overreacting here?

589
00:58:40,841 --> 00:58:43,992
I don't give a rat's ass if we are.
Out there, he's at risk.

590
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:47,796
If someone finds out what he is,
the whole program is destroyed.

591
00:58:48,001 --> 00:58:51,391
Jeez, relax.
Nobody's gonna find out.

592
00:58:51,601 --> 00:58:53,512
- Can I still shoot him?
- Where have you been?

593
00:58:53,961 --> 00:58:54,996
I told Carter.

594
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:58,713
I was getting stir-crazy.
I went home to pick up stuff.

595
00:58:58,961 --> 00:59:00,110
Bullshit.

596
00:59:00,561 --> 00:59:01,471
I went to your apartment.

597
00:59:01,681 --> 00:59:04,070
You did more than "pick up stuff."

598
00:59:04,281 --> 00:59:07,751
- What are you talking about?
- You, of all people. How could you?

599
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,758
What did you see in my apartment?

600
00:59:09,961 --> 00:59:11,758
I saw your face, your clothes.

601
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:14,839
Sebastian, in public.
Why'd you have to go out in public?

602
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:19,114
I'm still project leader.
It's my decision to make.

603
00:59:19,561 --> 00:59:22,633
You're right. It's your decision.

604
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:27,036
But if you leave again, I swear
I'll go straight to the committee.

605
00:59:27,961 --> 00:59:30,156
Throw your career away?

606
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:32,240
Not likely.

607
00:59:33,881 --> 00:59:34,870
Try me.

608
00:59:42,481 --> 00:59:44,073
So that's it, huh?

609
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:46,278
I'm officially a lab rat.

610
00:59:46,481 --> 00:59:48,676
You volunteered.
You knew the consequences.

611
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:53,033
Next time you do inventory,
get me an exercise wheel.

612
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:54,594
Yeah, sure.

613
00:59:56,081 --> 00:59:58,072
Let's pack it up and go home.

614
00:59:58,841 --> 01:00:02,151
- Exercise wheel? Was he serious?
- What do you think?

615
01:00:03,961 --> 01:00:06,794
The committee knows what we've done,
don't they?

616
01:00:09,161 --> 01:00:11,880
- Shit, Lin!
- Won't matter if we can get him back.

617
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:15,551
- I can't believe you did that!
- You have deniability, you didn't know.

618
01:00:16,481 --> 01:00:19,553
All I ask is please,
please don't fuck us.

619
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:27,714
- Think she'll say anything?
- No, she's in too far.

620
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:29,599
- She doesn't worry me.
- Sebastian.

621
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:34,153
He's gone longer than the animals.
It might affect his mind.

622
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:35,919
What if it already has?

623
01:00:39,161 --> 01:00:40,276
Hold still.

624
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:45,996
Good.

625
01:00:47,001 --> 01:00:50,471
- So what was it like?
- What do you mean?

626
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:54,794
- When you were out in the world.
- I just walked around. You know.

627
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:57,879
You just walked around.
Come on, there's more, right?

628
01:00:58,241 --> 01:00:59,469
Like what?

629
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:01,913
Man, if it was me...

630
01:01:02,161 --> 01:01:04,834
...I'd be fucking with people,
whispering in ears.

631
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,233
I'd be hanging out at Victoria's
Secret. I'd be the king.

632
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:13,519
Childish, don't you think?

633
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:14,996
No.

634
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:19,114
Well, it was late.
I wasn't out for very long.

635
01:01:19,481 --> 01:01:21,073
Did you see anybody?

636
01:01:21,321 --> 01:01:23,118
There was this one girl.

637
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,558
- Did you mess with her?
- No.

638
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:31,875
Well, maybe I scared her a little.

639
01:01:32,521 --> 01:01:33,874
How'd that feel?

640
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:36,274
I liked it.

641
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,880
Nice.

642
01:02:56,481 --> 01:03:00,554
Lin, remember the B and C?
I think I found it.

643
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:05,038
55 percent reversion.
That's the best we've gotten yet.

644
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:09,871
Protein structure was a dead end. Key
was to manipulate radiation signature.

645
01:03:10,081 --> 01:03:13,073
75 percent. 80 percent.

646
01:03:13,361 --> 01:03:15,238
- 82.
- Come on.

647
01:03:15,721 --> 01:03:16,915
We've got it.

648
01:03:17,121 --> 01:03:18,110
No, it's slowing.

649
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:20,198
- Be an optimist.
- It's slowing down.

650
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:23,393
88. 92 percent.

651
01:03:24,441 --> 01:03:26,318
93 percent.

652
01:03:27,321 --> 01:03:29,232
94 percent.

653
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:31,833
95 percent.

654
01:03:35,481 --> 01:03:36,755
- No!
- Shit!

655
01:03:37,841 --> 01:03:42,551
- Cellular bonds are collapsing.
- Full quantum cascade at 95 percent.

656
01:03:42,921 --> 01:03:44,240
Some breakthrough.

657
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:47,751
If I were on a table right now,
I'd be a steaming pile of flesh.

658
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:48,997
Don't tempt me.

659
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,634
We're closer, which counts.

660
01:03:50,841 --> 01:03:53,799
Closer! He just traded quantum
energy for stability!

661
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:55,229
- It's ludicrous.
- Come on.

662
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:58,399
- You're pissed you didn't think of it.
- Really, Matt?

663
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:01,638
95 percent?
That's not even worth my time!

664
01:04:03,441 --> 01:04:04,317
Asshole.

665
01:04:13,481 --> 01:04:15,551
You're a moron. What is your problem?

666
01:04:15,921 --> 01:04:19,038
Matt is onto something and
he could use your help.

667
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:23,110
Yeah, he's onto something, all right.

668
01:04:23,321 --> 01:04:26,438
He's on my coattails.
He's been riding them for years.

669
01:04:26,641 --> 01:04:29,951
Get off your fucking pedestal.
He's trying like hell to fix you.

670
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:31,951
Or kill me.

671
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:35,437
And you know what the sad part is?

672
01:04:35,681 --> 01:04:38,559
I have this gift and
I can't even use it.

673
01:04:39,721 --> 01:04:41,234
So now it's a gift.

674
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:42,999
Damn right it's a gift.

675
01:04:43,201 --> 01:04:47,433
If you weren't so shortsighted, you'd
let me out of this cage to explore it.

676
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:52,637
If you weren't so shortsighted, you'd
be with us trying to save your life.

677
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:55,914
My life?

678
01:04:56,321 --> 01:04:58,039
I have no fucking life.

679
01:04:58,321 --> 01:04:59,720
I'm a prisoner.

680
01:05:02,121 --> 01:05:04,430
- No, you're not a prisoner.
- Oh, yeah?

681
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:07,839
Is that what you think when
you leave here at night?

682
01:05:08,081 --> 01:05:10,549
Is that how you alleviate
your guilt...

683
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:15,477
...when I'm stuck in this shithole
and you're at home...

684
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:17,632
...fucking your boyfriend?

685
01:05:21,241 --> 01:05:23,038
What bothers you most?

686
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:25,592
That you don't have a life...

687
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:29,633
...or that I do?

688
01:06:05,841 --> 01:06:07,877
Frank, I'm coming down to the lab.

689
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:09,640
Don't you sleep?

690
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:13,476
- Da Vinci never slept.
- Okay. I'm here if you need me.

691
01:07:04,081 --> 01:07:06,959
I know Virginio

692
01:07:07,161 --> 01:07:09,994
Virginio I know

693
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:12,272
No, no, no, no.

694
01:07:56,761 --> 01:07:58,513
Motherfucker...

695
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:02,438
If you were any later,
I would have started without you.

696
01:08:16,321 --> 01:08:17,117
Jesus!

697
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,113
I don't see anything.

698
01:08:37,441 --> 01:08:38,635
Hello?

699
01:08:39,401 --> 01:08:40,470
No.

700
01:08:40,721 --> 01:08:42,154
No, he's here.

701
01:08:42,401 --> 01:08:44,835
Yes, I'm sure. I'm staring at him.

702
01:08:45,441 --> 01:08:46,635
Is something wrong?

703
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,471
- You want me to wake him?
- No, I was just checking.

704
01:08:54,641 --> 01:08:56,632
Who the fuck does she think she is?

705
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,480
I'm not good enough for her?
I'm not good enough?

706
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:01,951
I'll show them both how good I am.

707
01:09:02,201 --> 01:09:03,429
Quiet!

708
01:09:05,921 --> 01:09:07,434
Quiet!

709
01:09:07,921 --> 01:09:09,593
You want to fuck with me, bitch?

710
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:12,435
You know what happens when
you fuck with me?!

711
01:09:23,081 --> 01:09:26,596
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to hurt you. No one.

712
01:10:10,321 --> 01:10:13,631
It's really pretty clever.
All it does is loop the same image.

713
01:10:13,841 --> 01:10:15,320
What do we do now? Go after him?

714
01:10:15,721 --> 01:10:17,837
No. We're going to the committee.

715
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:20,037
Shouldn't we wait and talk to him?

716
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:22,436
He killed a dog with his bare hands.

717
01:10:22,641 --> 01:10:24,950
- You were there?
- He went out every night...

718
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:28,233
...with absolute disregard
for his safety and ours.

719
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:30,671
- What's he done?
- I don't want to know.

720
01:10:30,921 --> 01:10:33,719
- Are we in trouble?
- You didn't mislead the committee.

721
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:35,839
We'll take responsibility.

722
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:38,720
- What do we do when he comes back?
- Nothing.

723
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:40,838
The committee will bring security.

724
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:42,838
We'll brief you tomorrow morning.

725
01:10:54,241 --> 01:10:57,756
I had a lot of faith in you,
thinking you'd take care of this.

726
01:10:58,001 --> 01:11:00,071
I know what we did was wrong.

727
01:11:00,321 --> 01:11:04,712
Wrong doesn't even begin
to describe it.

728
01:11:05,201 --> 01:11:06,839
Let's leave it here.

729
01:11:10,601 --> 01:11:13,354
I'll call General Caster and
convene the committee.

730
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:15,910
You go back to the lab.
We'll handle him.

731
01:11:16,121 --> 01:11:17,554
Is there anything we can do?

732
01:11:17,801 --> 01:11:20,440
You might think about
clearing out your offices.

733
01:11:21,881 --> 01:11:24,839
For what it's worth,
we're both very sorry.

734
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:27,276
A little late for apologies.

735
01:11:30,721 --> 01:11:31,836
Howard?

736
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:33,840
What was that about?

737
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:36,676
- Just a screwup at work.
- How bad?

738
01:11:36,881 --> 01:11:38,792
Bad enough to wake a few generals.

739
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:35,440
Hi, boss.

740
01:12:50,201 --> 01:12:50,997
Help!

741
01:12:55,361 --> 01:12:56,680
Help! Help!

742
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:24,116
Howard!

743
01:13:47,321 --> 01:13:49,755
- Why so jumpy?
- You just surprised me.

744
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:52,032
No "good morning" for me today?

745
01:13:52,481 --> 01:13:54,039
You don't love me anymore.

746
01:13:54,641 --> 01:13:57,109
- Just in a hurry.
- Well, that's okay.

747
01:13:57,721 --> 01:13:59,791
It's going to be a busy day.

748
01:14:06,801 --> 01:14:08,075
When did he get back?

749
01:14:08,321 --> 01:14:11,438
Three a.m. He's been wandering
around the lab ever since.

750
01:14:12,001 --> 01:14:12,956
Kramer called yet?

751
01:14:13,201 --> 01:14:15,840
He's probably still meeting
with the committee.

752
01:14:16,241 --> 01:14:19,358
We should have heard something.
I'm calling.

753
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:24,038
Hello, is Dr. Kramer there?

754
01:14:24,721 --> 01:14:25,836
What?

755
01:14:29,121 --> 01:14:30,440
Oh, my God.

756
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:34,599
- What's wrong?
- He's dead.

757
01:14:34,881 --> 01:14:37,714
- What?
- He drowned in his pool last night.

758
01:14:43,441 --> 01:14:45,238
General Caster, please.

759
01:14:50,961 --> 01:14:52,235
There's no dial tone.

760
01:14:54,321 --> 01:14:57,996
- There's no outside line here either.
- We'd better alert security.

761
01:15:01,401 --> 01:15:04,632
- Authorization, please.
- McKay 1 -Delta-835.

762
01:15:05,321 --> 01:15:07,710
Authorization invalid.
Request denied.

763
01:15:08,121 --> 01:15:11,909
That's a first. McKay 1 -Delta-835.

764
01:15:12,401 --> 01:15:14,198
Authorization invalid.
Request denied.

765
01:15:14,921 --> 01:15:16,434
Let me try mine.

766
01:15:17,241 --> 01:15:19,630
Kensington 2-Romeo-159.

767
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:22,719
Authorization invalid.
Request denied.

768
01:15:26,641 --> 01:15:28,154
We've got a problem.

769
01:15:31,641 --> 01:15:32,710
I don't believe this.

770
01:15:32,921 --> 01:15:37,551
- When will they start looking for us?
- It could take a couple of days.

771
01:15:37,761 --> 01:15:40,878
- Can you hack into the system?
- Already in.

772
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:46,357
- Some security system.
- It's just he's extraordinary.

773
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:48,956
Someone's more extraordinary than me.

774
01:15:50,241 --> 01:15:51,959
- What is it?
- The system's fine.

775
01:15:52,161 --> 01:15:56,200
Our access codes have been removed.
There's only one left.

776
01:16:01,081 --> 01:16:03,470
- So we're trapped?
- We'll get him.

777
01:16:03,681 --> 01:16:05,034
Let me have one.

778
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:34,634
He's not in here.

779
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:40,352
Okay, Sebastian, fun's over.
Tell us where you are.

780
01:16:40,601 --> 01:16:43,957
Sorry, Linda, but I can't
let you turn me in.

781
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:47,239
Sebastian, where are you?

782
01:16:47,801 --> 01:16:49,473
You have no idea what it's like.

783
01:16:50,241 --> 01:16:53,870
The power of it, the freedom.
I can't let that go.

784
01:16:54,801 --> 01:16:58,760
Whatever you're planning,
the phones, the elevator...

785
01:16:59,121 --> 01:17:02,113
...it's not gonna work.
They know about you.

786
01:17:02,321 --> 01:17:03,470
No, they don't.

787
01:17:03,921 --> 01:17:06,116
Kramer died before
he could tell a soul.

788
01:17:06,721 --> 01:17:08,120
I saw to that.

789
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:09,151
Jesus.

790
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:13,992
- You realize what you're saying?
- It's amazing what you can do...

791
01:17:14,201 --> 01:17:17,716
...when you don't have to look
at yourself in the mirror anymore.

792
01:17:18,521 --> 01:17:20,512
- Sebastian.
- Goodbye, Linda.

793
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:23,949
Shit!

794
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:27,440
Where's Janice?

795
01:17:28,321 --> 01:17:29,754
She was right behind us.

796
01:17:30,001 --> 01:17:31,514
Oh, fuck.

797
01:17:31,721 --> 01:17:34,519
Oh, fuck. Oh, my God!

798
01:17:49,601 --> 01:17:50,670
In there.

799
01:17:53,521 --> 01:17:55,751
- Darts.
- Is it Sebastian?

800
01:18:03,921 --> 01:18:05,559
Oh, my God.

801
01:18:05,761 --> 01:18:06,750
Shit!

802
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:08,440
Oh, my God.

803
01:18:10,801 --> 01:18:12,029
She was right behind us.

804
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,551
How could he do this?

805
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:17,350
He snapped. He fucking snapped.

806
01:18:17,801 --> 01:18:18,995
It's worse.

807
01:18:19,521 --> 01:18:21,830
- He's thought this through.
- What?

808
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:24,032
He knew we were going to turn him in.

809
01:18:24,441 --> 01:18:28,036
He knew that his career would be
over and his only way out...

810
01:18:28,281 --> 01:18:32,240
...is to make sure no one knows
what he is or what he's done.

811
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:35,791
- Which means he'll get rid of us.
- Goddamn you!

812
01:18:36,201 --> 01:18:38,192
- You could've stopped this!
- Back off.

813
01:18:38,401 --> 01:18:40,392
- You risked our lives!
- Shut up!

814
01:18:40,601 --> 01:18:42,637
Don't tell her to shut up!
She's right!

815
01:18:42,841 --> 01:18:46,117
I don't care if she's right!
I don't care whose fault this is!

816
01:18:46,481 --> 01:18:48,836
I just want to know,
what do we do now?

817
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:52,672
Frank, can you restore the codes?

818
01:18:53,761 --> 01:18:56,719
- I'll try.
- We can't afford to sit here and wait.

819
01:18:56,921 --> 01:18:59,958
We are not gonna wait.
We are gonna take him down.

820
01:19:00,881 --> 01:19:02,280
Ever use this thing before?

821
01:19:02,521 --> 01:19:05,513
We designed it to help find
the rats we kept dropping.

822
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:07,439
Too small for thermal scans.

823
01:19:07,921 --> 01:19:10,435
- Connecting.
- Powering up.

824
01:19:10,641 --> 01:19:12,836
Activating motion detectors.

825
01:19:13,321 --> 01:19:14,834
We've got movement.

826
01:19:15,641 --> 01:19:17,791
- Corridor six.
- There he is.

827
01:19:20,121 --> 01:19:21,440
Got it.

828
01:19:22,601 --> 01:19:23,954
- Check.
- Check.

829
01:19:24,321 --> 01:19:26,551
- Matt, be careful.
- Just watch our backs.

830
01:19:26,801 --> 01:19:28,359
- Ready?
- Let's do it.

831
01:19:36,321 --> 01:19:38,471
Take a left at the next corridor.

832
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:40,677
Could we trap him in corridor eight?

833
01:19:40,921 --> 01:19:44,231
- lf he keeps heading that way.
- I'm on five.

834
01:19:53,521 --> 01:19:55,477
- Anything?
- I think we can climb out.

835
01:19:55,721 --> 01:19:57,871
There's a ladder in
the elevator shaft.

836
01:19:59,721 --> 01:20:01,393
Shit, I lost him.

837
01:20:01,921 --> 01:20:03,639
- I lost him.
- He stopped moving.

838
01:20:06,161 --> 01:20:06,957
It's me. It's me.

839
01:20:09,201 --> 01:20:10,873
- You have anything?
- Nothing.

840
01:20:11,121 --> 01:20:12,554
How did he get by us?

841
01:20:12,761 --> 01:20:14,160
He couldn't have.

842
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:18,830
There. Behind the pipes.

843
01:20:21,601 --> 01:20:22,875
Dr. Caine?

844
01:20:23,721 --> 01:20:26,030
- Can you hear me?
- I'm taking him down.

845
01:20:27,441 --> 01:20:28,635
Cover me.

846
01:20:29,281 --> 01:20:30,157
Covered.

847
01:20:44,001 --> 01:20:47,357
It's just a vent.
It's just a goddamn vent.

848
01:20:53,401 --> 01:20:55,153
Let him go! Let him fucking go!

849
01:21:08,121 --> 01:21:09,349
Matt, what's happening?

850
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:11,793
Carter's down! He's hurt bad!

851
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:12,877
Get out of there.

852
01:21:13,481 --> 01:21:15,039
Where the fuck is Sebastian?!

853
01:21:15,321 --> 01:21:17,551
Shit. He's right on top of you!

854
01:21:26,641 --> 01:21:29,872
- Where's he headed?!
- He's coming this way, to the lab.

855
01:21:30,321 --> 01:21:32,551
The doors are closing!
He's shutting me in!

856
01:21:34,521 --> 01:21:35,670
- You have him?
- I do.

857
01:21:36,201 --> 01:21:38,556
He's still there.
He's on your side of the door.

858
01:21:38,841 --> 01:21:40,797
- Where?
- He's right in front of you.

859
01:21:41,001 --> 01:21:42,195
He's coming at you!

860
01:21:44,841 --> 01:21:47,401
I got thermals all over the place.
Five or six.

861
01:21:51,041 --> 01:21:52,156
I'm losing resolution!

862
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:59,351
He's pumping out heat.
You won't be able to see him.

863
01:22:00,401 --> 01:22:02,835
The air's the same temperature
as his body.

864
01:22:03,081 --> 01:22:04,150
- He's trapped.
- I'm going.

865
01:22:04,361 --> 01:22:06,352
- It's not safe.
- Get Carter! Meet at the lab.

866
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:08,432
- We shouldn't separate!
- Get Carter.

867
01:22:08,721 --> 01:22:10,598
Marco. Polo.

868
01:22:13,321 --> 01:22:14,470
Marco.

869
01:22:16,961 --> 01:22:17,757
You missed.

870
01:22:17,961 --> 01:22:22,751
- Now'd be a good time to pay that tab.
- Come on! You think you can take me?!

871
01:22:22,961 --> 01:22:24,235
Come on!

872
01:22:30,881 --> 01:22:31,950
What happened to you?

873
01:22:32,201 --> 01:22:34,920
Was it the serum that fucked you up,
or the power?

874
01:22:36,641 --> 01:22:41,237
Aren't you the fucked up one?!
Dining on my leftovers...

875
01:22:41,921 --> 01:22:44,310
...no life except the one
you borrowed from me!

876
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:47,675
- Even with Linda.
- She left you, remember?

877
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:51,954
Jesus Christ, I can't imagine what
the fuck she sees in a loser like you!

878
01:22:52,201 --> 01:22:53,873
I'm not a deranged asshole!

879
01:22:54,121 --> 01:22:56,351
No, but you're weak!

880
01:23:00,561 --> 01:23:03,997
I thought killing you would be hard!
But I kind of like it.

881
01:23:16,481 --> 01:23:20,599
Oh, my God. Fuck! His pulse
is weak! His breathing's shallow!

882
01:23:20,801 --> 01:23:22,439
- He'll be okay!
- No, it's severe!

883
01:23:22,641 --> 01:23:25,155
- He's gonna be okay!
- Get down here!

884
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:27,596
Keep applying pressure
until I get back!

885
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:29,672
- Where you going?
- He needs blood.

886
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:33,112
- Wait for the others!
- lf I wait, he'll die!

887
01:23:34,121 --> 01:23:34,917
Fuck!

888
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:50,676
God, I told them to meet us here.

889
01:24:07,921 --> 01:24:09,240
Oh, God.

890
01:24:31,081 --> 01:24:34,357
Come on. Give me one step,
Sebastian. One fucking step.

891
01:24:34,921 --> 01:24:35,876
Move!

892
01:24:44,441 --> 01:24:45,635
Fuck.

893
01:24:47,441 --> 01:24:48,954
Quite a mess.

894
01:24:55,881 --> 01:24:57,439
Fuck! You motherfuck...

895
01:24:58,641 --> 01:24:59,869
Get off!

896
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:04,875
- We had so much fun the last time.
- No, please don't. Please.

897
01:25:05,441 --> 01:25:06,590
Sweet dreams.

898
01:25:15,721 --> 01:25:16,915
You know...

899
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:20,676
...I've always admired
your feistiness.

900
01:25:36,441 --> 01:25:39,001
Goddamn it, Carter!
Don't die on me now!

901
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:42,235
Sarah, I'm losing him!

902
01:25:43,521 --> 01:25:45,113
- Where is she?
- He needed blood.

903
01:25:45,321 --> 01:25:47,630
- She went alone?
- He would've died!

904
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:49,634
He's dead.

905
01:25:50,361 --> 01:25:51,510
Come on.

906
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:01,956
Wait.

907
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:18,400
Keep spraying.

908
01:26:22,121 --> 01:26:23,440
Oh, no.

909
01:26:29,521 --> 01:26:30,636
Nothing.

910
01:26:32,201 --> 01:26:33,839
What's happening?!

911
01:26:35,641 --> 01:26:38,360
She's dead, isn't she? Motherfucker!

912
01:26:43,801 --> 01:26:44,597
Jesus.

913
01:26:51,881 --> 01:26:53,758
I got it. I got it.

914
01:26:55,241 --> 01:26:56,799
Oh, God!

915
01:27:08,441 --> 01:27:09,874
- Fuck.
- Bye-bye, Linda.

916
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:12,758
Have fun with your boyfriend.

917
01:27:15,521 --> 01:27:17,034
We're locked in.

918
01:27:18,721 --> 01:27:20,234
How bad?

919
01:27:22,001 --> 01:27:24,879
You're losing blood,
but he didn't hit any organs.

920
01:27:25,121 --> 01:27:27,112
- Frank?
- No.

921
01:27:28,921 --> 01:27:31,389
I gotta find something
to close the wound.

922
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:37,669
Shit.

923
01:27:41,521 --> 01:27:42,795
Talk to me.

924
01:27:43,001 --> 01:27:45,879
Everything is spinning.

925
01:28:11,081 --> 01:28:14,198
- Are you still with me?
- I can't feel anything.

926
01:28:15,721 --> 01:28:17,120
Can you feel this?

927
01:28:18,241 --> 01:28:19,435
A little.

928
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:20,757
Come on.

929
01:28:20,961 --> 01:28:22,360
I need you to fight this.

930
01:28:22,561 --> 01:28:24,791
- I need you to stay awake.
- I'm trying.

931
01:28:25,201 --> 01:28:27,840
Come on. Talk to me.

932
01:28:28,241 --> 01:28:29,276
Talk to me!

933
01:29:03,321 --> 01:29:05,039
Hello, face.

934
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:54,989
We are not gonna die in here.

935
01:31:48,441 --> 01:31:50,750
I'll be back with help. I promise.

936
01:32:16,521 --> 01:32:20,196
- Authorization, please.
- Caine 0027.

937
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:22,796
- Confirmed.
- Thank you.

938
01:32:24,641 --> 01:32:27,599
- I can't let you leave.
- Sorry, you don't have a choice.

939
01:32:27,801 --> 01:32:29,553
Oh, yes, I do.

940
01:32:45,361 --> 01:32:48,558
You think you're God?
I'll show you God!

941
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:06,598
I always knew you were a bitch!

942
01:34:12,921 --> 01:34:13,717
Bitch!

943
01:34:16,961 --> 01:34:18,997
No wonder it didn't work out
between us!

944
01:34:27,601 --> 01:34:29,910
Stay the fuck away from her!

945
01:34:32,921 --> 01:34:35,196
Thought I'd save you for a change.

946
01:35:04,001 --> 01:35:05,957
Come on. I heard an explosion!

947
01:35:21,601 --> 01:35:22,875
- Don't touch it!
- What?

948
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:24,952
- It's nitro.
- We gotta stop it.

949
01:35:25,161 --> 01:35:26,674
No, we can't! Come on!

950
01:35:26,881 --> 01:35:28,837
There's a ladder in the elevator.

951
01:35:33,041 --> 01:35:35,157
- Can you climb?
- Do I have a choice?

952
01:35:53,241 --> 01:35:54,754
You go first.

953
01:36:43,001 --> 01:36:44,150
Move!

954
01:36:55,601 --> 01:36:56,636
Oh, shit.

955
01:36:57,681 --> 01:36:58,909
Stick to the side!

956
01:37:11,721 --> 01:37:13,359
It's coming back down!

957
01:37:18,641 --> 01:37:19,517
Down! Go down!

958
01:37:48,281 --> 01:37:49,191
Holy shit.

959
01:37:52,481 --> 01:37:54,278
We better go before it slips.

960
01:38:27,081 --> 01:38:29,595
Get off of me! Get off of me!

961
01:39:10,881 --> 01:39:14,760
- Let go of me!
- One last kiss.

962
01:39:16,241 --> 01:39:17,959
For old times' sake.

963
01:39:37,601 --> 01:39:38,397
Go to hell.

964
01:40:05,401 --> 01:40:06,197
Come on.

965
01:40:22,841 --> 01:40:24,240
Oh, my God.

966
01:40:24,441 --> 01:40:27,717
Not God. Not anymore.
