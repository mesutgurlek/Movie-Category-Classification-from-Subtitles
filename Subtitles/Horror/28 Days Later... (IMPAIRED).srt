You're from the hospital.

- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.

I'm a bicycle courier.

67
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:49,712
I was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.

68
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,549
Then I wake up today in hospital.
I wake up and I'm...

69

I'm hallucinating or I'm...

70

What's your name?

71
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,849
Jim.

72

I'm Mark. This is Selena.

00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,275
OK, Jim.

74
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,033
I've got some bad news.

75
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:25,373
It started as rioting, and right from
the beginning you knew this was different.

76
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:29,627
Because it was happening
in small villages, market towns.

77
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,256
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.

78
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:38,052
It was in the street outside.
It was coming through your windows.

79
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,971
It was a virus.

80
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,848
An infection.

81
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,767
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.

82
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,311
It was the blood.

83
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,897
There was something in the blood.

84
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:56,320
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.

85
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,323
The infection was everywhere.

86
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,909
The army blockades were overrun.

87
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,164
And that's when the exodus started.

88
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,293
The day before broadcasting stopped,

89
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:14,046
there were reports of Infection
in Paris and New York.

90
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,343
We didn't hear anything more after that.

91
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,266
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.

92
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,810
Of course there's a government!

93
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,981
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...

94
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,360
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.

95
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,907
No TV, no radio, no electricity.

96
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:45,703
You're the first uninfected person
we've seen in six days.

98
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,584
They're dead. Like Selena's.

99
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,794
Yours will be dead too.

100
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:08,100
Look, I have to find them.
They live in Deptford. I can walk it. OK?

101
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,770
You'll go and come back, yeah?

102
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,982
- You won't.
- Yes!

103
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,069
No one ever comes back.

104
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,659
So lesson one.

105
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:29,956
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.

106

Lesson two.

107
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,546
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.

108

We'll take you tomorrow.

109
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,303
We'll all go and find
your dead parents together, OK?

110
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,806
Eat.

111

If you want her to slow down,
you'll have to say.

- I understand.

113
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,894

My...

121
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:01,459
parents and my sister,
we went to Paddington Station,

122
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:09,425
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.

123
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,428
I remember my dad had all this cash,

124
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,848
even though cash was completely useless.

125
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,520
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.

126
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,233
Crowd was surging.

127
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,402
I lost my grip on my sister's hand.

128
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,907
I remember the ground was soft.

129
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:39,247
I looked down
and I was standing on all these people.

130
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,292
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...

131
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:47,338
Somewhere in the crowd
there were Infected. It spread fast.

132
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,758
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.

133
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,471
Climb over more people.
So I did that. I climbed.

134
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,932
And I got up on top of this kiosk.

135
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:05,189
Looking down, you couldn't tell
which faces were infected and which weren't.

136
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:09,151
Then I saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.

137
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,195
My dad.

138
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,575

00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,133
Um... I... Yes.

165
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:04,887
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.

166
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:08,641
More Infected will be coming.
They always do.

167
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,423
<i>(Jim) How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?</i>

168
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:44,427
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. It was on you.

169
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,891
I didn't know he was infected.
He knew. I could see it in his face.

170
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:54,395
If someone gets infected,
you've about 20 seconds to kill them.

171
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:59,609
It might be your brother, your sister
or your oldest friend. It makes no difference.

172
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:05,114
Just so you know where you stand,
if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.

173
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:09,410
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?

174
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:13,956
Do you want us to find a cure and
save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?

175
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,542
Plans are pointless.

176
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,212
Staying alive's as good as it gets.

177
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,465
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

178
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,634
What's that?

179
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,808
Let's go.

180
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:21,065
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys?

181
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,235
Stop talking. It's a long way up.

182
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,289
<i>(Selena) Do you need a break?</i>

183
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,500
- You?
- No.

184
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,255
Now I do need a break.

185
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,559
What's up?

186
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,644
Nothin'.

187
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,356
I got a headache.

188
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,941
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.

189
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:09,322
- Why didn't you say something before?
- I didn't think you'd give a shit.

190
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:14,785
You've got no fat on you
and all you've had to eat is sugar.

191
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:16,996
So you're crashing.

192
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,332
There isn't a lot we can do about that

193
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:24,504
except pump you full of painkillers
and give you more sugar. As for sugar,

194
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,881
Pepsi or Lilt?

195
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,134
Do you have any Tango?

196
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:33,262
Actually,
I did have a can of Tango somewhere.

197
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:34,388

198

00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,903
Oh no, they're in. Move!

200
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,534
Wait up, Selena!

201
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,453
Wait for me, please!

Please, Selena! Please!

00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:02,083

- Come on!

204
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,168
- Run!
- Wait!

Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!

208
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,598
Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,113
Open the door!

210
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,287
Open the door!

211
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,502
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?

212
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,045
What?

213
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,634
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?

214
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:56,012
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.

215
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,230
Go in. Go in!

- Selena. Good to meet you.

220
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,884
This is my daughter Hannah.

Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.

222
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,723
Come on.

223
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:43,434
So...

224
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:45,436
This is great. Just great.

225
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:50,066
Calls for a celebration, I'd say.

226
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:53,194
Why don't you all sit down and...

227
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:56,239
Hannah, what have we got to offer?

228
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,825
We've got Mum's crème de menthe.

229
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,619
Great. Crème de menthe.

230
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,413
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.

231
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:06,958
Get comfortable.

232

Nah, the good ones. It's a celebration.

234
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:18,344
Top cupboard.

235
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:21,138
So this is your place?

236
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,141
It's nice.

237
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,447
There.

238
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:41,617
I know it isn't much but, well, cheers.

239
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,452

00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:10,354
Yeah.

243
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:16,027
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

244
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:19,947
You'll have to use the bucket.

245
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:29,123
Have to empty it each morning.

246
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:32,877
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.

247
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,670
It's fine.

248
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:37,882
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.

249
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,928
We have a spare room.

250
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,263
In there.

251
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:46,307
Are you and Selena...?

252
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:49,393
No. No, no, no.

253
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:51,145
Um...

254
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:53,606
I'll take the living room. It's fine.

255
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,566
Right.

256
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,528
No, I mean, yeah.

257
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,572
So, um...

258
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:05,618
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.

259
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:21,801
Very spruce.

260
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,972
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.

261
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:34,021
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.

262
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:37,984
Probably need us more than we need them.

263
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,696
I think they're good people.

264
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:47,493
- Good people?
- Yeah.

265
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:53,958
You should be more concerned about
whether they're gonna slow you down.

266
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:57,795
- Because if they slowed you down...
- I'd leave them behind.

267
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:59,797
- In a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

268
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,175
I wouldn't.

269
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:05,803
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.

270
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,647
I'm gonna get some sleep.

271
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,027
Selena...

272
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:25,114
You think I don't get it, but I do get it.

273
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:30,995
And I know I'd be dead already
if I hadn't met you.

274
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:33,080
Sure.

275
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:34,749
No, look...

276
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,212
I mean, thank you.

277
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,550
And I mean, sure.

278
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:47,428
Goodnight, Jim.

279
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:49,597
Goodnight.

280
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,279
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.

281
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:09,492
I thought we'd be OK with the water
from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.

282
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:12,787
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.

283
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:17,792
You drink it,

284
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,669
it evaporates,

285
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,838
turns stagnant.

286
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:26,300
They're all empty.

287
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:29,178
Hasn't rained in ten days.

288
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:33,516
You can set up a plastic sheet
to catch dew and condensation.

289
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,353
Saw it on TV once, but I can't make it work.

290
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:40,773
You'd never think it.

291
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:44,652
Needing rain so badly.

292
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,739
Not in fucking England!

293
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:56,539
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.

294
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:09,218
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.

295
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:13,890
<i>(man on radio) Salvation is here.

- Yeah, it's a recording.

304
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:44,879
But this is where it's telling us to go.

305
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:47,131
Just there.

306
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:53,429
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.

309
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:08,653
- Look, I didn't...
- No, it's OK. It's the truth.

310
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:11,239
I can't leave the block if it's the two of us.

311
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:15,284
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. I couldn't risk it.

312
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:17,078
But with other people...

313
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:21,457
If it's a recording,
the soldiers who made it could be dead.

314
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:25,044
- It's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to Infection...

315
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:29,423
There is no answer!
It's already done all the damage it can!

316
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:32,343
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.

317
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:36,514
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!

318
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,893
Or die here.

319
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:46,691
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.

320
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:50,069
We need each other.

321
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:55,449
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.

322
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,244
So we have to try and get there.

323
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,955
Get there how?

324
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:16,137
Just so you know,
I don't take cheques or credit cards.

325
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:47,710
<i>- (Frank) What do you think?
- It's the most direct route.</i>

326
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:53,049
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.

327
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:55,468
<i>(Frank) Let's just get it done.</i>

328
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:10,566
<i>(Jim) No, no.</i>

329
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,152
No. See, this is a really shit idea.

330
00:44:14,028 --> 00:44:17,406
<i>You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.</i>

331
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,869
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars...

332
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:24,872
It's really fucking obviously a shit idea!

333
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:27,208
Hold on!

334
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:38,261
Dad!

335
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:42,431
<i>(screaming and laughing)</i>

337

The world's worst place to get a flat.

338
00:45:03,035 --> 00:45:06,372
Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.

339
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:11,043
I've got the wheel. You're on the jack.

340
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:29,187
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?

341
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,355
Hear what?

342
00:45:32,023 --> 00:45:34,317
<i>(Hannah) Right, I've done it.</i>

343
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,361

<i>- Jesus Christ!

346
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:45,953
Fucking rats!

347
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:59,091
They're running from the Infected.

348
00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:01,093
Move it!

349
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:05,473
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.

350
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:08,809
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!

351
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:14,732
Lift, lift!

352
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:20,404
<i>- (Selena) Don't look at them! Don't look!
- (Jim) I can see them! They're coming!</i>

353
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:24,075
<i>(screeching)</i>

354
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:28,704
Come on, Hannah!

355
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:31,207
Almost.

356
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,210
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- I'm trying.

357
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:41,676
Three, two, one,

358
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:43,469
drop it!

359
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:50,059
- Get in the car!
- Come on!

360
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:54,522
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!

361
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:59,527
<i>(Jim) Whoo!</i>

362
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:06,409
Goodbye, you fuckers!

363
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,669
Frank, stop the cab.

364
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,944
Let's shop.

365
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:50,953
<i>(Frank making engine noises)</i>

366
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,081
You...

367

You...

368
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,294
You...

369
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:00,963
<i>(Jim) Anybody seen any buns?</i>

370
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:03,841
Hmm. Irradiated.

371
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:10,139
Don't take anything
that needs to be cooked, OK?

372
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:12,058
I think you can eat that raw.

373
00:48:12,141 --> 00:48:14,018
Decaffeinated coffee...

374
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:16,187
Put that back.

375
00:48:17,396 --> 00:48:19,649
Can't just take any crap.

376
00:48:19,732 --> 00:48:24,237
If I never see another chocolate bar again,
it'll be too soon.

377
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:27,323
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!

378
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,578
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.

379
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:35,498
Warm but not aggressive.

380
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:39,085
<i>- (Hannah and Selena laughing)
- Peaty aftertaste.</i>

381
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,923
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.

382
00:49:38,811 --> 00:49:41,898
Either we do this now or we're walking.

383
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:50,990
Not you.

384
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:56,621
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?

385
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:58,789
You heard.

386
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:27,443
Where are you going?

387
00:50:28,528 --> 00:50:30,947
We've got enough food, Jim.

388
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,366
We don't have any cheeseburgers.

389
00:50:34,116 --> 00:50:36,786
<i>(quietly) Like going on holidays
with your aunt!</i>

390
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:18,452
Oh, Jesus.

391
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,813
Hello?

392
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,412
I hate you!

393
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:12,673
Find anything?

394
00:52:14,926 --> 00:52:17,720
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.

395
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:19,889
OK, we're done here.

396
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:23,976
OK, Hannah.

397
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,027
Easy. Brake!

398
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,196
Brake, brake!

399
00:52:43,037 --> 00:52:45,122
Out.

400
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:32,920
<i>(Selena) Mmmm! Oh my God!</i>

401
00:53:33,671 --> 00:53:36,674
I can, like, taste the vitamin C.

402
00:53:37,508 --> 00:53:40,303
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.

403
00:53:41,512 --> 00:53:43,598
What did you say?

404
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:46,475
The raisins. They're so moist.

405
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,316
Look over here.

406
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,454
Like a family.

407
00:54:06,537 --> 00:54:08,998
<i>(Hannah) Do you think they're infected?</i>

408
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:11,501
<i>(Frank) No.</i>

409
00:54:14,962 --> 00:54:17,673
They're doing just fine.

410
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:25,515
Come on. Let's eat!

411
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:41,531
Know what I was thinking?

412
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:45,326
That you'll never hear
another piece of original music again.

413
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:49,580
You'll never read a book
that hasn't already been written,

414
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:54,460
or see a film that hasn't already been shot.

415
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:02,218
<i>Um... that's what you were thinking.</i>

416
00:55:02,301 --> 00:55:04,178
No.

417
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:07,723
I was thinking I was wrong.

418
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:11,060
About what?

419
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,856
All the death.

420
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:17,525
All this shit.

421
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:23,656
It doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...

422
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:28,494
Well, she's got her dad
and he's got his daughter. So...

423
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:30,705
Cheeky monkey!

424
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:34,792
I was wrong when I said
staying alive is as good as it gets.

425
00:55:38,421 --> 00:55:40,923
<i>See, that's what I was thinking.</i>

426
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:43,092
Was it?

427
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:45,469
Mm. You stole my thought.

428
00:55:50,683 --> 00:55:52,560
Sorry.

429
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:55,396
That's OK.

430
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,565
You can keep it.

431
00:55:58,691 --> 00:56:02,695
It's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.

432
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:20,296
I can't sleep.

433
00:56:20,379 --> 00:56:23,007
Me neither.

434
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,468
Doesn't feel safe, does it?

435
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:27,637
Outside like this.

436
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:30,932
I think we're safe enough.

437
00:56:31,015 --> 00:56:33,684
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.

438
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:36,896
Yeah, I noticed that.

439
00:56:36,979 --> 00:56:38,481
Hey, Selena...

440
00:56:38,564 --> 00:56:40,650
What? What is it?

441
00:56:41,984 --> 00:56:44,028
How'd you get to sleep?

442
00:56:50,493 --> 00:56:54,372
Bloody hell. Must've needed
a hell of a prescription for that lot.

443
00:56:54,455 --> 00:56:58,751
I didn't need a prescription.
I qualified as a chemist.

444
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:01,379
Oh, great. Valium.

445
00:57:01,462 --> 00:57:04,048
Not only will we be able to get to sleep

446
00:57:04,131 --> 00:57:07,844
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.

447
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:10,179
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.

448
00:57:10,263 --> 00:57:12,306
Can I, Dad?

449
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:14,392
I don't think so, sweetheart.

450
00:57:14,475 --> 00:57:15,977
Please?

451
00:57:17,478 --> 00:57:19,564
- No.
- I can't sleep.

452
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,361
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.

453
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:30,449
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.

454
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:43,087
Night-night.

455
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,507
You're a big softie, Frank.

485
01:04:05,511 --> 01:04:07,430
Nothing.

486
01:04:07,513 --> 01:04:09,432
I can't believe it.

487
01:04:09,515 --> 01:04:11,476
Frank...

488
01:04:11,934 --> 01:04:13,811
Frank!

489
01:04:16,022 --> 01:04:17,690
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

490
01:04:17,773 --> 01:04:20,276
Go fucking where?!

01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:30,304
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.

496
01:05:31,222 --> 01:05:33,933
Sorry I lost my temper.

I love you very much.

499
01:05:39,272 --> 01:05:41,274
- What?
- Keep away from me.

500
01:05:41,357 --> 01:05:43,693
Stay where you are.

501

- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!

Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!

- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!

508

Kill him!

509

Stay away from him!

<i>(man) Three survivors. One male, two female.</i>

I repeat, one male, two female.

514
01:06:58,684 --> 01:07:01,270
ETA, 15.

515
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:03,815
Put the kettle on.

516
01:07:51,779 --> 01:07:54,282
I'm Major Henry West.

517
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:57,243
- Welcome.
- Jim.

518
01:07:57,326 --> 01:07:59,328
Hello, Jim.

519
01:07:59,412 --> 01:08:01,164
Hello.

520
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:08,296
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.

521
01:08:08,379 --> 01:08:10,798
So you can all have a shower.

522
01:08:10,882 --> 01:08:14,218
You look like you need one. Please.

523
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:39,368
It ain't funny. I got loads of cooking to do,
you fucking Doris!

524
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:42,580
Run him over!

525
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:48,085
<i>(Jim) How is she doing?</i>

526
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:51,339
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.

527
01:08:54,008 --> 01:08:56,511
It's all fucked.

528
01:08:56,594 --> 01:08:58,596
What do you mean?

529
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:07,230
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.

530
01:09:07,313 --> 01:09:09,398
Hey, don't do that.

531
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:16,072
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough,
strong, and she'll cope just like I'll cope.

532
01:09:16,155 --> 01:09:20,076
- Just like you'll cope.
- I don't want her to have to fucking cope.

533
01:09:21,369 --> 01:09:23,788
I want her to be OK.

534
01:09:25,373 --> 01:09:27,542
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.

535
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,419
It was OK for them and it was OK for us.

536
01:09:33,756 --> 01:09:36,175
Now it's all just fucked.

537
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:10,459
So you heard our broadcast?

538
01:10:10,543 --> 01:10:14,046
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.

539
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:20,261
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.

540
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,851
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to Infection.

541
01:10:29,187 --> 01:10:31,272
Yeah.

542
01:10:31,355 --> 01:10:35,860
As I said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.

543
01:10:36,235 --> 01:10:39,155
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.

544
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:42,366
The fire drove hundreds of Infected
out of Manchester.

545
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,536
The surrounding area's teeming with them.

546
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:49,916
But don't worry.

547
01:10:49,999 --> 01:10:52,502
You're quite safe here.

548
01:10:55,588 --> 01:11:01,469
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights
which we've rigged up to a generator.

549
01:11:02,512 --> 01:11:05,097
High perimeter wall which helps.

550
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:09,435
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.

551
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:14,190
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.

552
01:11:17,443 --> 01:11:22,365
Secondary to protection,
our real job is to rebuild. Start again.

553
01:11:22,448 --> 01:11:24,867
The belly of the house. The heart.

554
01:11:24,951 --> 01:11:30,206
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.

555
01:11:30,289 --> 01:11:32,375
The kitchen.

556
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:34,585
Here you are. I'll swap you.

557
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:37,880
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.

558
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:42,009
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.

559
01:11:42,093 --> 01:11:44,470
Jones, our resident tin opener.

560
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:47,557
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.

561
01:11:48,182 --> 01:11:50,268
I can't wait.

562
01:11:57,775 --> 01:12:00,027
And lastly, meet Mailer.

563
01:12:03,823 --> 01:12:05,783
Mailer, Jim.

564
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:07,994
Jim, Mailer.

565
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:11,873
Got infected two days ago.

566
01:12:11,956 --> 01:12:17,044
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.

567
01:12:21,674 --> 01:12:23,759
Keeping him alive?

568
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,764
The idea was to learn something
about Infection.

569
01:12:30,099 --> 01:12:32,185
Have him teach me.

570
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:40,943
And has he?

571
01:12:43,112 --> 01:12:45,281
In a way.

572
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:54,874
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.

573
01:12:54,957 --> 01:12:57,126
Farm crops,

574
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:59,879
raise livestock.

575
01:12:59,962 --> 01:13:02,381
He's telling me he's futureless.

576
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:11,891
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the Infected take to starve to death.

577
01:13:45,007 --> 01:13:48,219
<i>(singing)</i>

578
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:54,100

579
01:13:54,183 --> 01:13:56,435

580
01:13:56,519 --> 01:13:59,105

So, what have we here?

584
01:14:15,496 --> 01:14:18,875
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...

585
01:14:23,629 --> 01:14:26,382
<i>- (man) Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!</i>

586
01:14:26,465 --> 01:14:28,926
- It's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.

587
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:32,221
Absolutely. I was going to propose a toast

588
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:35,433
but this omelette will do just as well.

589
01:14:38,019 --> 01:14:40,521
<i>- To new friends.
- (all) New friends.</i>

590
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:54,911
Jones, did you notice while cooking
that these eggs were off?

591
01:14:54,994 --> 01:14:58,414
I thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.

592
01:14:58,498 --> 01:15:00,374
Get rid of it.

593
01:15:02,835 --> 01:15:05,296
<i>(man) Doris, you twat.</i>

594
01:15:05,379 --> 01:15:08,174
I don't suppose you can cook, can you?

595
01:15:09,008 --> 01:15:14,472
I can't tell you how badly we need
someone with a little flair in the kitchen.

596
01:15:14,555 --> 01:15:19,101
What a fucking disappointment.
I saw those eggs, I thought it was Christmas.

597
01:15:19,185 --> 01:15:22,438
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.

598
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:25,358
You muppet! Look at him, eh?

599
01:15:25,441 --> 01:15:29,487
He's still waiting
for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.

600
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:33,908
- You don't know nothing.
- I think Bill's got a point.

601
01:15:33,991 --> 01:15:37,119
If you look at the whole life of the planet,

602
01:15:37,203 --> 01:15:39,121
we...

603
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:43,334
you know, Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.

604
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:46,546
So if the infection wipes us all out,

605
01:15:47,547 --> 01:15:49,841
<i>that is a return to normality.</i>

606
01:15:53,845 --> 01:15:56,848
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.

607
01:15:56,931 --> 01:16:00,184
Have you met our New Age sergeant?

608
01:16:00,268 --> 01:16:02,979
Our spiritual guru.

609
01:16:03,062 --> 01:16:08,276
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why
did you join the army in the first place?

610
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:15,199
This is what I've seen
in the four weeks since Infection.

611
01:16:15,283 --> 01:16:17,910
People killing people.

612
01:16:17,994 --> 01:16:22,540
Which is what I saw in the four weeks before
Infection, the four weeks before that...

613
01:16:22,623 --> 01:16:28,087
As far back as I care to remember,
people killing people.

614
01:16:28,171 --> 01:16:31,799
Which to my mind
puts us in a state of normality now.

615
01:16:40,099 --> 01:16:43,060
- You're not eating?
- I don't want to eat.

616
01:16:43,144 --> 01:16:45,938
You must eat, Hannah.

617
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:49,275
I don't want to eat.
I want to bury my dad.

618
01:16:50,193 --> 01:16:53,321
He's one of the people you're talking about.

644
01:19:13,753 --> 01:19:16,797
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.

645

Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.

646

Slow down.

647
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:30,728

- Sir.

648

Clear the bodies off the lawn.

649

We're very grateful for your protection
but if we're gonna stay here...

- Who have you killed?
- No one.

655

Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive
now if you hadn't killed somebody.

656
01:20:19,735 --> 01:20:22,864
I killed... I killed a boy.

657
01:20:27,201 --> 01:20:29,287

658
01:20:30,663 --> 01:20:32,748
Yes.

Otherwise he'd have killed you.

Survival.

662

What?

664
01:21:00,276 --> 01:21:04,071
Eight days ago I found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.

665
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:09,952
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.

666
01:21:10,036 --> 01:21:12,914
What could I say to him?

667
01:21:12,997 --> 01:21:18,211
We fight off the Infected or we wait
until they starve to death and then what?

668
01:21:19,128 --> 01:21:22,965
What do nine men do
except wait to die themselves?

669
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:29,180
I moved us from the blockade, I set the radio
broadcasting and I promised them women.

670
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:35,895
Because women mean a future.

671

You've got to let them go!

682

You can be with us.

683
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:33,244
But I can't let them go.

684

How could Infection cross the oceans?

How could it cross the mountains
