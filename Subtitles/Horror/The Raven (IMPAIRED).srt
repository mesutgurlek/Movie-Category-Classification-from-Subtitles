with a serious accident

in attendance...

If you come again sometime,
I will show you

Next time.

63
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,330
Yes. I've actually built,

torture and horror devices

00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,420
Oh, Jean,
you were darling.

164
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,582
[all chattering]

165
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,888
...most charming.
Not only charming
but dramatic as well.

166
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,984
Thank you so much.

167
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,085
That was marvelous, dear.

168
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,094
Dad.

169
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,892
What do you call that dance?

170
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,933
You've never
done that before, have you?

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,093
I call it
"The Spirit of Poe."

172
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,368
So that was
your surprise.

173
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,507
Was it a great surprise?

174
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,505
"Whom the angels
call Lenore"

175
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,849
[clicking]

176
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,733
I told you never to
come into this room
unless I send for you.

177
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,432
I'm sorry, sir.
Judge Thatcher is here.

178
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,876
Judge Thatcher here.

179
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,340
Yes, sir.

180
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,173
All right, send him in.

181
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,477
Very good, sir.

182
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,061
Good afternoon, Dr. Vollin.

183
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,567
Good afternoon.

184
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,197
Will you step in?

185
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,672
Thank you.

186
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,072
You were
expecting my daughter.

187
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:44,579
You see, last night,
while Jean was dancing,

188
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,092
l... I observed something
that... that worried me.

189
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,891
Later on,
in Jean's dressing room,
l... I felt the same thing.

190
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,590
Then l... I questioned Jean.

191
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,701
And she made a confession.

192
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,863
She's in danger of becoming
infatuated with you.

193
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,506
Of course,
I can understand that.

194
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,634
You... You saved her life,
Dr. Vollin.

195
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,270
You think it's
only gratitude she feels?

196
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,211
Oh, don't say it
that way, Dr. Vollin.

197
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,715
Don't cheat us
of the right to be
grateful to you.

198
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,615
Come to the point, Thatcher.

199
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,553
Well, I made it
about as plain
as I can without, uh...

200
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:21,419
Look here, you... you know
that Jean's engaged
to young Jerry Halden.

201
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,758
Now we can't let her
get any ideas
about you, can we?

202
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,593
You are saying,
Judge Thatcher,

203
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,293
that Jean has
fallen in love with me.

204
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,532
No, I'm not quite
saying that.

205
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,596
That you do not approve.

206
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,639
You disapprove yourself,
Dr. Vollin.

207
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,473
You don't want
a young girl like Jean
falling in love with you.

208
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,018
Dr. Vollin,
l... I came to you once

209
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,522
and asked you,
when death was near,
to save Jean.

210
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,188
I come to you again.

211
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:53,689
But this time

212
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:58,756
instead of from death,
you want to save her from me.

213
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,691
Oh.

214
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,834
I never realized, Vollin.

215
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,871
I'm sorry you feel like this.

216
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,440
Now that you know,

217
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,708
you still say that
your greatest wish
is for her to marry Halden?

218
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:20,250
More than ever.

219
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,150
There's no point
in saving Jean's life

220
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,416
if we're going to
sacrifice her happiness.

221
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,889
You mustn't see her again.

222
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,222
You driveling fool.
Stop talking.

223
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,761
Be careful, Vollin.

224
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,489
Not see her again?

225
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,729
Listen, Thatcher,

226
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,091
I'm a man
who renders humanity
a great service.

227
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,466
For that, my brain
must be clear,

228
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,174
my nerves steady
and my hands sure.

229
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,275
Jean torments me.

230
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,837
She has come into my life.
Into my brain.

231
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:51,883
Forget it, man. Forget it.

232
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,715
Judge Thatcher,
there are no two ways.

233
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,411
Send her to me.

234
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,819
Do you know
what you're saying?

235
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,085
There are no two ways.
Send her to me.

236
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,888
You're mad.
I am mad.

237
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,020
And I tell you,
the only way you can cure...

238
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,529
I can't talk to you,
Vollin.

239
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,792
I came here with a perfectly
reasonable objection

240
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,731
and expected you
to be reasonable.

241
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,362
Instead I find you stark,
staring mad.

242
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,235
Good day, Dr. Vollin.

243
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,064
[door slamming]

244
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,166
Send her, Judge Thatcher.

245
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,106
I warn you.

246
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,546
Doctor Vollin.

247
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,980
Home, Hillview Heights.

248
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,867
[doorbell ringing]

249
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,767
I want to see Dr. Vollin.

250
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,074
What do you want to see
Dr. Vollin about?

251
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,512
I am Dr. Vollin.

252
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,081
I want to see you.

253
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,678
Come this way.

254
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,794
Come into my office.

255
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,226
Come.

256
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,915
You're Edmond Bateman.

257
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:07,116
Who told you?

258
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,017
Your picture in the papers.

259
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:11,318
That's no disguise.

260
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,325
That's why I'm here.

261
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,759
He said you could do...

262
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,631
What was it he called it?

263
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,940
I want you should
change my face.

264
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,870
But I'm not
a plastic surgeon, Bateman.

265
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,978
He said you could do it.

266
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,875
That is unnecessary,
Bateman. Put it away.

267
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,454
I can do it.
I can change your face.

268
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,790
Then do it.

269
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,260
It isn't plastic surgery,

270
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,795
but there is a way.

271
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,834
Any way!
It's all right with me.

272
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,028
First, you must do
something for me.

273
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:02,438
Like what?

274
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:04,470
It's in your line.

275
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,542
Like what?

276
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,175
Torture and murder.

277
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,382
That's not my line.
My line is...

278
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,011
You shot your way out
of San Quentin.

279
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,850
Two guards are dead.

280
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,421
In a bank in Arizona,
a man's face was mutilated,
burnt.

281
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,255
Cashier of the bank.

282
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,727
Well, he tried to
get me into trouble.

283
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,264
I told him to
keep his mouth shut.

284
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,924
He gets the gag
out of his mouth

285
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,435
and starts yellin'
for the police.

286
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,695
I had the acetylene torch
in my hand...

287
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,742
So, you put the burning torch
into his face.

288
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,635
Into his eyes.

289
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,540
Well, sometimes you can't help
things like that.

290
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,484
This job I want done
is in your line, Bateman.

291
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,680
Accept my word for it.

292
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,356
I want you to do this for me.

293
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,357
Then, I change your face.

294
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,695
I got money.
I'll pay for it.

295
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,230
No money.

296
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,396
I don't want to
get into no more trouble.

297
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,937
And they're after me now.

298
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,666
I can take care of that.

299
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,470
You can stay here
after the job is done.

300
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,505
I'll tell you
something, Doc,

301
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,206
ever since I was born,

302
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,809
everybody looks at me
and says, "You're ugly."

303
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,151
Makes me feel mean.

304
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,889
Why are you telling me this?

305
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,957
I am not interested
in your life story.

306
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,157
I'm saying, Doc,

307
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,326
maybe because I look ugly...

308
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,261
Maybe if a man looks ugly,
he does ugly things.

309
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:47,202
You are saying
something profound.

310
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,043
A man with a face
so hideously ugly...

311
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,448
Don't ask me to do
this job for you, Doc.

312
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,958
I don't want to do
them things no more.

313
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,859
Fix me so I look good,
will you?

314
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,089
Then maybe I could...

315
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:07,927
All right, Bateman.

316
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,725
You'll do it, Doc?
You'll change me?

317
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,234
Yes.
When?

318
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,997
Now.

319
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,814
What's that?

320
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,810
You don't need that.
Give it to me.

321
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,217
No, you don't.

322
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,755
I'll keep this.

323
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,289
What's that?

324
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,757
I'm taking you
where if police
or anyone should come,

325
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,794
they can't find you.

326
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,657
Oh, oh, I see
what you mean.

327
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,856
It is to
protect you, Bateman.

328
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:43,832
Come.

329
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:44,869
You go first.

330
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,404
Of course.
I show you the way.

331
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,120
The operation is
very simple.

332
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,216
In 10 minutes, it's done.

333
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,257
Is that all it takes?

334
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,120
The nerves,
the nerve ends, Bateman,

335
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:16,463
the seventh cranial nerve,
which has its root here,

336
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:21,098
from this come
the nerves that control
the muscles of the face.

337
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,936
If something happens
to these nerve ends,

338
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,535
it alters your expression.

339
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,740
In other words,
I who know what to do
with these nerve ends

340
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:35,947
can make you look
anyway I choose.

341
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,323
Now, loosen your collar.
Lie down.

342
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:44,018
I will not need you
until Monday.

343
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,078
Thank you, sir.

344
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,215
Have a pleasant holiday.

345
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,849
Thank you, sir.

346
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,235
Ah, you're doing fine,
Bateman.

347
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,533
I will take a look.

348
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,758
[rasping]
It's hard to talk.

349
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,432
That's to be expected.
It will disappear.

350
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:11,768
Do...

351
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,639
Do I look different?

352
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,705
Yes.

353
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,523
Something's the matter.

354
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,552
My eye.

355
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:32,953
That will pass, Bateman.

356
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,293
My mouth.

357
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,432
[panting]

358
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,700
I want to see myself.

359
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,233
All right.
Just wait here.

360
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:22,702
No!

361
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,979
[glass shattering]

362
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,320
[Dr. Vollin laughing]

363
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,788
[clicking]

364
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,431
[Bateman snarling]

365
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,716
(Dr. Vollin)
Bateman.

366
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,054
Are you ready to
do it for me, Bateman?

367
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,795
Fix my mouth.

368
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:15,329
You're monstrously ugly.

369
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:20,865
Monstrous ugliness
breeds monstrous hate.

370
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,364
Good.

371
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,771
I can use your hate.

372
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,470
You will do this
for me, Bateman.

373
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,503
Fix my mouth.

374
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:32,348
I'll fix your mouth, Bateman.

375
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,881
Do it. Change me.

376
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,717
I'll change you, Bateman.

377
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,425
You will look good.
The way you wish.

378
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,925
Make me look good.

379
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:50,358
First you must do
this job for me, Bateman.

380
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,570
I can't use my hand to do it.

381
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,707
Your hand is used to torture.

382
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,972
Your hand must do it.

383
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:03,211
My brain. Your hand.
Speak up, Bateman.

384
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:08,050
Do you wish to remain
the ugly monster that you are?

385
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,884
No. No.

386
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,690
Then you will do this job
for me, will you?

387
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,588
You must speak now.
Yes or no.

388
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,466
Yes.

389
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,661
Good.

390
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,362
Wait.

391
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,041
[door lock clicking]

392
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,558
Put on these clothes,

393
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,722
and report to me
for further instructions.

394
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,130
Be quick about it.

395
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,692
In an hour,
my guests will arrive.

396
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:04,632
[door closing]

397
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:33,704
I wonder if Dad
will be very angry.

398
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,205
Why should he?

399
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,867
He distinctly said no
when we got the invitation.

400
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,874
Why?

401
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:39,875
Well...

402
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,275
Don't go
into that again.

403
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,938
We've been
all over that before.

404
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:46,040
Well, I do agree with him
that Dr. Vollin is
a little mad.

405
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,381
Well, aren't we all?
What of it?

406
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,253
You know, uh,
you're taking quite a chance
persuading me to go.

407
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,347
How?

408
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:55,255
He kind of likes me.

409
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:57,221
Yeah, I'll bet.

410
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,456
All right,
what will you bet?

411
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:00,657
I'll bet you...

412
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:02,894
(Dr. Vollin)
All right. Place your bets.

413
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,991
[all chattering]

414
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,399
They're off!

415
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,768
Please notify my horse
the race has started.

416
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,363
Oh, isn't it exciting,
Pinkie?

417
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,532
Y-Yes, quite.

418
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,303
I like my horse.
He has such a kind face.

419
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,401
(Dr. Vollin)
The quarter.

420
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,776
Come on, Number 5!
Number 3. Number 3!

421
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:16,939
Come on Number 5!

422
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,415
Number 3. Number 3.
Number 3.

423
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,112
Doesn't my horse look
like your father, Pinkie?

424
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,348
I hadn't noticed
the resemblance, my love.

425
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,413
Come on, Azucar!
Ladysman.

426
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,254
They're on the home stretch.

427
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,987
I will not let myself
get excited.

428
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,686
[all exclaiming]

429
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,062
I'm afraid to look.
Who's winning?

430
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,156
Number 5 wins.

431
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,292
That's me!
I'm the winner.

432
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,495
Wasn't mine
the brown horse, Pinkie?

433
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,436
No, no. Yours was
the white, my love.

434
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,666
Oh.

435
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,004
I've been rooting
for the wrong horse.

436
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,274
Oh, Jerry, you idiot,
what're you doing?

437
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,041
I'll be a mess, you fool.
Stop it.

438
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,172
[all laughing]

439
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,046
Next race.
Place your bets.

440
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:56,484
Now, I'll have to go upstairs
and fix my hair.
I'm a sight, I know.

441
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,351
Well, don't forget
you owe me two bits.

442
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,859
You know, I like horses,
l... I grew up with them.

443
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,788
Yes, I can see that
when I look at you.

444
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,524
Does anyone want
any more horse races?

445
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:07,656
(Harriet)
Not me.

446
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:09,495
(Grant)
It's too exhausting
a game for me.

447
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,659
Let's go
and get a drink.

448
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:11,929
Feel this, my pet.

449
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,868
Just what am I
supposed to feel?

450
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,838
My pulse. It's beating.

451
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,505
I'm going to ask
Dr. Vollin's advice.

452
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:19,508
Doctor.

453
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:20,566
Yes, Colonel.

454
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:24,445
I get the most
peculiar sensations, uh,
pains you might call them.

455
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,746
Not exactly pains, but, uh,
they come and they go.

456
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,183
What would you say
they were?

457
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,017
You eat too much, Colonel.

458
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:33,057
I'm asking Dr. Vollin,
my pet.

459
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,388
You're always
trying to get
free advice.

460
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,654
Now, now, my pet.

461
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,094
You know, the other evening
we met Dr. Thayor,

462
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,461
and he turned out
to be a veterinary.

463
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:42,726
[laughing]

464
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,860
My pet, he gave me
some very good advice
about my dogs.

465
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,001
[guffawing]

466
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,280
[exclaims]

467
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,086
Man to see you.

468
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,022
Excuse me.

469
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,223
Oh, p-please,
don't stand there.

470
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,928
Yes. Move away,
my man, like a good fellow.

471
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,027
Never stand behind people.

472
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,438
Most unfortunate looking
fellow.

473
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,167
I'm so glad you have come,
Judge Thatcher.

474
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,870
Dr. Vollin,
is my daughter here?

475
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,643
Judge Thatcher,
I'm genuinely sorry

476
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,377
for all the stupid things
I said to you the other day.

477
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,181
I want you,
please, to forget.

478
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,585
One can't forget a man
saying...

479
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:40,180
But l... I was
under terrible strain

480
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,419
and if you can feel
in anyway indebted to me,

481
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,588
clear your debts
by forgiving me
for what I said.

482
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,595
Well, I suppose a man can...

483
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:49,758
Oh, I...
You do forgive me.

484
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,699
Now let's go
and... and join the others.

485
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,105
Go upstairs
and tell Miss Thatcher
her father is here.

486
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,801
[all exclaiming]

487
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,277
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Glad to see you.

488
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,813
Hello, Judge,
I was wondering
whether you'd arrived.

489
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,087
[screams]

490
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,551
[Jean screaming]

491
00:33:16,627 --> 00:33:18,458
That's from upstairs.

492
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,257
Oh, Dad,
I'm so glad you are here.

493
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,324
What happened?

494
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,564
(Jerry)
What's the matter?
You look as white as a ghost.

495
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:28,969
I just had
a terrible fright.

496
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,972
What was it?

497
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,373
I was standing in my room
looking in the mirror

498
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,934
when the door opened
and an awful looking man
came in.

499
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,641
Oh, you mean,
my servant, poor fellow.

500
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:38,975
Come on, let's sit down.

501
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,608
I will tell you about him.

502
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,879
Come.

503
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,379
I'm sorry, Miss Thatcher,
that my servant scared you.

504
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,048
Please be seated.

505
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,655
All of you, please.

506
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,696
Poor fellow,

507
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,324
he can't help
the way he looks.

508
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,199
He served
in my regiment.

509
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,238
Arab bandits
took him a prisoner.

510
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,705
They mutilated him
and tortured him.

511
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,505
They have a genius
for devising torture.

512
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,644
It's almost the equal
of Edgar Allan Poe.

513
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,806
Dr. Vollin is
keen about Poe.

514
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,214
Yes, I've noticed.

515
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:16,151
Why your
extraordinary interest
in Poe, Dr. Vollin?

516
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,154
That poem of Poe's,
<i>The Raven.</i>

517
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,883
I say, what is
<i>The Raven?</i>

518
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,788
It's a bird, Pinkie.

519
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,065
A pretty thing to
have around the house.

520
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,728
But isn't the raven
the symbol of death?

521
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:33,998
It always has been.

522
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,540
What is your
interpretation
of <i>The Raven?</i>

523
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,370
I will tell you.

524
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,877
Poe was a great genius.

525
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,642
Like all great geniuses,

526
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,739
there was in him
the insistent will

527
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:50,621
to do something big, great,
constructive in the world.

528
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,814
He had the brain
to do it.

529
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,754
But he fell in love.

530
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,523
Her name was Lenore.

531
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,759
"Longing for
the lost Lenore"

532
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:05,329
"Longing for
the lost Lenore"

533
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,599
Something happened,

534
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,204
someone took her away
from him.

535
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:16,706
When a man of genius
is denied of his
great love, he goes mad.

536
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,483
His brain instead of
being clear to do his work

537
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:23,146
is tortured.

538
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,589
So he begins to
think of torture.

539
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:32,387
Torture for those
who have tortured him.

540
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,765
My interest in Poe,

541
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,234
the way I speak
about torture and death,

542
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,828
you people, being laymen,
perhaps do not understand.

543
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,808
As a doctor, a surgeon,
I look on these things
differently.

544
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,876
A doctor is fascinated
by death and pain.

545
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,713
How much pain
a man can endure.

546
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,116
But I disagree with you,
Dr. Vollin.

547
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,677
That's not why
I'm a doctor.

548
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,451
(Dr. Vollin)
You're a doctor
because you want to do good.

549
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:01,549
Yes.

550
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,389
Please let's
change the subject.

551
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,019
[yawning]
Let's go to bed.

552
00:36:05,096 --> 00:36:07,360
Why, Colonel, where are your
company manners?

553
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,625
I'm sleepy, my pet.

554
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,394
I'm sleepy, too,
Pinkie.

555
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,527
Let's all go to
our nice warm beds,

556
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,400
on this cold, windy night.

557
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,372
Well, if it isn't rude
to our host.

558
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,566
On the contrary,

559
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,906
I am flattered that you act
as if you were at home.

560
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,842
[all laugh]
Thank you. Thank you.

561
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,608
[all chattering]

562
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,549
I'm so sorry.

563
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:39,957
Sorry?

564
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,931
You came into the room
so suddenly.

565
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,866
Please believe
I wouldn't have been
frightened otherwise.

566
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,233
Oh, Jean.

567
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,532
Coming.

568
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,528
Jean!

569
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,071
Come on, darling.

570
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,145
[wind howling]

571
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,277
[thunder rumbling]

572
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,487
This is your room,
Judge Thatcher.

573
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,858
Thank you.

574
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:15,157
Uh, Dr. Vollin, may I see you
for just a minute?

575
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,568
I'd like to know
about the drafts
in this house.

576
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,627
You know, I'm very sensitive
about drafts.

577
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,366
I'm certain
you'll be comfortable.

578
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,737
Thank you.
Please.

579
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,074
Allow me.

580
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:28,975
After you, sir.

581
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,547
(Thatcher)
This man, Vollin is
stark, staring mad.

582
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:32,947
Why, Dad!

583
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,749
Now, you came here
against my wishes.

584
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,447
All right, it's done.

585
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:39,648
But now let's get
our things together
and go home.

586
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,123
What?
Let's go home.

587
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,124
But why?

588
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,593
In the talk I had
with him the other day,
he said some things

589
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,222
that absolutely convinced me
he's not in his right mind.

590
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,960
And just now,
the way he talked
about Poe and... and torture...

591
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,127
Oh, talk, that's all it was.
He was being amusing.

592
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,797
Well, I'm afraid
there's something wrong
with my sense of humor.

593
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,340
I tell you,
it's dangerous to be
under this man's roof.

594
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:00,206
Oh, Dad, he's not going to
cut our throats
while we're asleep.

595
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,973
Well, I think
it's entirely possible.

596
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,035
[laughs]

597
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,743
Grown-up people.

598
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,114
When a perfectly reputable
and distinguished surgeon
talks about Poe,

599
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,618
why get scared?

600
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,518
There's absolutely nothing
to be afraid of.

601
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,216
[knocking on door]

602
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,588
Come in.

603
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,292
Get out of here.

604
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,492
Judge Thatcher.

605
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,364
(Dr. Vollin)
Bateman!

606
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,169
What are you doing here?

607
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,437
Go downstairs.

608
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,245
You mustn't
be frightened.

609
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,016
The poor fellow
means nothing.

610
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,991
Probably came up to see
if there's anything
he could do for you.

611
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,117
Are you comfortable?

612
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,183
Quite, thank you.

613
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,662
Yes. Thank you, I'm sure
we shall be very comfortable.

614
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,699
Good. Then I'll leave you now.
Goodnight.

615
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,563
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

616
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,141
You're worried
about Jean, aren't you?

617
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,402
Yes, I am.

618
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:09,003
You're afraid that
in the middle of the night
he might...

619
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,546
Don't you think
it would be a good idea
if I changed rooms with her?

620
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:14,948
And what about you?

621
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,850
Well, he certainly isn't
coming into my room.

622
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,081
Well, let me
do that then.

623
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,850
Come on.
I'll go change rooms
with Jerry.

624
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:20,822
All right.

625
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,051
Take my bags, dear,
will you?

626
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,252
All right.

627
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,654
[wind howling]

628
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,229
[thunder clapping]

629
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,265
Come along, Bateman.

630
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,362
(Dr. Vollin)
The most unique museum
of torture.

631
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,058
Rare old pieces,
all of them.

632
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,828
But I warn you,
ready for use.

633
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,490
This device is
from one of Poe's stories.

634
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,357
<i>The Pit and the Pendulum.</i>

635
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,221
A man was thrown
into a pit

636
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,659
and tied to a slab
like this.

637
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:43,867
[machine humming]

638
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:48,241
Suddenly he hears
some peculiar noise
coming from above his head.

639
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,542
He looks up,

640
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,942
sees a knife flashing.

641
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,351
Swinging rhythmically

642
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,919
as it gradually descends.

643
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,959
These things here
are manacles

644
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,464
which are controlled
by that lever.

645
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,703
Clasped around
the wrists and ankles

646
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:17,238
they hold a man
on the slab...

647
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,801
helpless.

648
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:22,102
He cannot move.

649
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:29,181
In 15 minutes,
the knife reaches the heart.

650
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,385
Got you.

651
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:44,894
[laughs]

652
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,563
Come on, Bateman. Release me.

653
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,738
Release me, Bateman.

654
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,149
And please try to remember,
should anything happen to me,

655
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,154
you remain the hideous monster
that you are.

656
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:10,287
Come on, Bateman.

657
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:20,797
[sighs]

658
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:28,877
It's all quite simple,
isn't it, Bateman?

659
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,019
[chimes]

660
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,170
[thunder clapping]

[screams]

662
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:11,882
[banging on door]

663
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,549
Jerry, oh, I'm afraid!

664
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,287
What-What's the matter?
What's happened?

665
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,555
Look in my room.

666
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,097
All right, come on then
if you're afraid.

667
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,764
[wind howling]

668
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,174
[laughing]
Darling, that's nothing.

669
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,609
The wind's blown a tree down,
it's fallen against
your window, that's all.

670
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,909
Here, put your robe on
or you'll get cold.

671
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:41,076
Jerry, I saw a man
coming up through the floor.

672
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,914
[thunder clapping]

673
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,579
Darling, I can understand
you imagining
all sorts of things

674
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,625
but not a man coming up
through the floor.

675
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,285
I'm not imagining it.

676
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:56,061
I'll tell you what you do,
you sleep in your own room.
Come on.

677
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,163
Now you hop
right into bed.

678
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:05,868
You've got to
get some sleep, you know.

679
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,706
I guess,
Daddy was right after all.

680
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,769
We probably
should have gone home.

681
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,906
[laughing]
Don't be silly.

682
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:13,642
There.

683
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:15,879
You all right now?

684
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:17,011
Yes, dear.

685
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,652
Not frightened anymore?

686
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:19,711
Uh-uh.

687
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,248
Good night, my sweet.

688
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,690
Good night, darling.

689
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:27,357
What do you mean sneaking up
through the trapdoor?

690
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,933
Don't compel me to treat you
like an animal.

691
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:35,103
You were looking
for the girl, weren't you?

692
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,104
Answer me.

693
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,268
Yes.

694
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,980
The girl does not
concern you.

695
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,216
Why did you
try to go to her?

696
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,921
Answer me, why?

697
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,888
[knocking on door]

698
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:00,889
Who is that?

699
00:45:00,964 --> 00:45:02,625
(Grant)
It's the Colonel.

700
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,958
My wife wants
a sleeping powder,
Dr. Vollin.

701
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,832
She woke me
out of a sound sleep

702
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,896
and told me to go down
and get a sleeping powder.

703
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,305
[yawning]
You know, there-there's
nothing worse

704
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,539
than being wakened
from that first sweet sleep.

705
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,271
I doubt if I shall
fall asleep again.

706
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:20,282
Certainly.
Just wait a moment here.

707
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:32,928
Oh, pardon me.
I-I'm so sleepy.

708
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:34,190
Here are two powders.

709
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,788
Two?
One for you.

710
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:39,302
For me? Huh, Dr. Vollin,
I don't know
how to thank you.

711
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,528
Such a nice man,
so thoughtful.

712
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,873
It's now 11:00.

713
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,242
The job begins.

714
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,099
[muffled screaming]

715
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,273
[muffled shouting]

716
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,848
(Thatcher)
Let me go!

717
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,686
[Thatcher groaning]

718
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:41,864
[muffled chattering]

719
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,933
Let me go! Help! Help, Jerry!

720
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:54,437
Help me! Help me!

721
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,679
Help! Let me go!

722
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,814
[muffled shouting]

723
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,222
Greetings,
Judge Thatcher.

724
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,820
What's the meaning
of this, Vollin?

725
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:17,731
My servant is
a little uncivilized,
so I ask your forgiveness.

726
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,071
Now, I see you can
hardly stand on your feet.

727
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:26,074
Bateman,
see that Judge Thatcher
lies down.

728
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,575
[grunts]

729
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,305
Make him comfortable,
Bateman.

730
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,330
What's that thing?

731
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,663
A knife.

732
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:54,997
What's it doing?

733
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,369
Descending.

734
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,569
What are you
trying to do to me?

735
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,444
Torture you.

736
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,948
Oh, try to be sane, Vollin.

737
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,508
I'm the sanest man
who ever lived.

738
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,044
I will not be tortured,

739
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:17,587
I tear torture out of myself
by torturing you.

740
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,060
[laughs]

741
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:25,699
15 minutes.

742
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,970
There's the clock.
You can see it.

743
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:34,109
Torture waiting.

744
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:36,837
Waiting.

745
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:45,183
It will be sweet,
Judge Thatcher.

746
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,553

No!

Jerry, help!

00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,653
Jerry!

Jerry!

[screams]

754
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:46,481
Do not be alarmed.

755
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,916
I've a pleasant surprise
for you.

756
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,349

Jerry! Jerry!

00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,061
Help me. Jerry!

Geoffrey! Geoffrey!

763
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:23,579
Wake up, Geoffrey!
They've got Jean!

764
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:25,650
I say!

765
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,252
What is it, old boy?

766
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,557
They've got Jean. Wake Grant.

767
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,527
Jerry!

768
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,627

[groans]

770
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,497
I couldn't wake
either the Colonel
or Mrs. Grant.

771
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,802
They seem to
have been drugged.

772
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,673
Where's Judge Thatcher
and Jean, old boy?

773
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,268
They took Thatcher
through this panel.

774
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,143
They must have Jean, too.
I can't open it.

775
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,511
Here, let me help you,
old chap.

776
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:54,550
I've looked everywhere.
I'll call the police.

Hello. Hello, operator.
Operator.

00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,286
The line's dead.

[rumbling]

781
00:51:09,032 --> 00:51:10,499
What's that?
What's what?

782
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,693
Look!

783
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,098
Oh, Pinkie!

784
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,302
It's a steel shutter.

785
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,769
There is now
no way of getting in,

786
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:25,905
no way of getting out.

787

Jerry, please!

789
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,680
Uh. Oh.

790
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,191
We can't hear
the wind anymore.

791
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,695
It's as if we were
all in a tomb.

792
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,324
We've got to get through
that panel.

793
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,000
Do you mind if I smoke?

794

Jerry!

Jerry, help me!
Help me!

What're you going to do
to Jean?

Oh, I have the most
delightful plan for her.

801

Help me. Jerry! Help me!

802
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:17,129
He said stop.

803
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:21,764
Yes,

804
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,236
I'm ugly.

805
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:27,502
He did it.

806
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:28,976
Dr. Vollin?

807
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,178
Yes.

Oh, he's mad.

809
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,381
What will he do to me?

810
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,915
He won't hurt you.

811
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,180
Will you help me?

812
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:39,654
You will help me, won't you?
You'll help me
get out of here?

813
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:41,350
No! No!

814
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,151
Vollin is going

815
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,789
to fix my face.

816
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,561
I tell you he's mad.

817
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,001
He won't help you.
I'll help you.

818
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:56,067
(Dr. Vollin)
Bateman.

819
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,602
Please get me out of here.

820
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,643
I swear, I'll help you.

821
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:01,836
Bateman!

822
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,282
[sobbing]
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

823
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,685
I'm going through.

824
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,591
That's what they
want you to do. It's a trap.

825
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:20,527
Going through all the same.

826
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:21,621
Got to follow him.

827
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,165
(Mary)
Oh. Oh, Pinkie!

828
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,963
You know what to do, Bateman.

829
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:30,939
(Jean)
Dad! Jerry!
Please come! Jerry!

830
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:43,644
You!

831
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,421
Jerry! Oh, Jerry!

832
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,291
(Thatcher)
It's Jean!

833
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:56,325
The switch, to open this lock.

834
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:57,899
[rattling]
It's locked.

835
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,094
The servant
must have the key.

836
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,831
Jean! Jean! Jean!

837
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,799
Don't do it,
he'll kill you.

838
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,841
Bateman, bring him here.

839
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,999
Jerry.

840
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:18,110
You're just in time
to be witnesses
to a wedding ceremony.

841
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:22,283
Now the ceremony begins.

842
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,993
Too bad, Judge Thatcher
cannot be with us.

843
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,256
[gasps]

844
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:28,659
[moaning]

845
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:34,070
But if we speak
loudly enough,
perhaps he can hear us.

846
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,269
At any rate,
we can hear him.

847
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,069
At least let my father go.

848
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,042
We will dismiss the question
of your father.

849
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,578
Consider it
well disposed off.

850
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:45,706
See here, Vollin, things
like this can't be done.

851
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,545
It's no use, Geoffrey.
Look at his eyes.

852
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:51,178
I'll soon be rid
of my torture.

853
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:52,987
Rid of it!

854
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,889
And I'll be the sanest man
who ever lived.

855
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,283
Now,

856
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:01,288
I have a pleasant surprise.

857
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,563
Bateman.

858
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,902
Do as I order, Bateman!
The switch.

859
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,006
My gift to you two.

860
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,484
The place in which
you will live.

861
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:26,919
A humble place, but your love
will make it beautiful.

862
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,117
All right, go in.

863
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,486
Go in.

864
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,297
[moans]

865
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:47,974
You will live in this place
forever and ever.

866
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,212
It will be
the perfect marriage.

867
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:53,707
The perfect love.

868
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,049
You will never be separated.

869
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,780
Never. Bateman!

870
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,814
Bateman!
Come on, Bateman, close it!

871
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,734
Forever and ever.

872
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:14,292
[laughs]

873
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,569
What a torture!

874
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,780
What a delicious torture,
Bateman.

875
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:27,014
Greater than Poe.

876
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,777
Poe only conceived it.

877
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:32,219
I have done it, Bateman.

878
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,882
Poe, you're avenged!

879
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,227
[laughs maniacally]

880
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,173
What happens in that room?

881
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:58,542
Another one
of Poe's devices, Bateman.

882
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:03,177
It's the room
where the walls
come together.

883
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:04,613
[machine humming]

884
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:05,915
Darling,

885
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:08,813
there's nothing we can do.

886
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:14,329
It doesn't take long,
Bateman, until they're
crushed, dead.

887
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:16,431
That girl

888
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:18,501
dead?

889
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:19,694
Why not?

890
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,561
You've killed in your time.

891
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:24,630
You monster,
you like to torture.

892
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:29,007
Yes. I like to torture.

893
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,320
You've done nobly, Bateman.

894
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,854
Now, I'll do nobly by you.

895
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,257
[laughs]

896
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:47,861
You-You'll fix me?

897
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,153
Yes.

898
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:55,596
[Thatcher moaning]

899
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:04,311
She crushed to death?

900
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,074
Yes.

901
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,378
No!

902
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,745
No.

903
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,457
What are you doing?

904
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,359
First, I let her go.

905
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:24,764
If you touch
that switch, Bateman,

906
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,996
I'll not fix you.

907
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,037
No.

908
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,595
You'll stay
the way you are, Bateman.

909
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,605
No!

910
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,173
If you touch that...

911
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,272
Stop!

912
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,040
[Mary screams]

913
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:46,377
[Mary groans]

914
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,910
[screams]

915
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:22,224
Bateman!

916
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:24,283
Bateman!

917
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,419
I'll get the key.
You go to Thatcher.

918
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,757
[machine humming]

919
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,301
(Jerry)
Come on, Geoffrey!

920
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:33,858
I've got the key.

921
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:36,938
Get that thing
out of the way.

922
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,599
Oh.

923
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:41,007
Come on.

924
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:46,804
Oh!

925
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:48,908
Daddy!

926
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:51,520
It's all right.
It's all right,
don't worry.

927
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,646
No, it's all my fault.

928
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:53,882
No, it's not
your fault, dear.

929
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,447
Don't blame yourself.
I'm so sorry.

930
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:56,651
We're all safe now.

931
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,658
[screams]

932
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:58,785
What is it, my pet?

933
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:01,295
The Colonel. We've forgotten
the Colonel and his wife.

934
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:03,556
[Grant snoring]

935
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:16,210
Poor Bateman.
He gave up his life.

936
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,816
Yes, darling, he saved us
from being crushed,
all right.

937
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,009
Yes.

938
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:28,724
I think I'd better
finish the job, don't you?

939
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:31,117
Only a little more gently.

940
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:33,294
So you're
the big, bad raven, huh?

941
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,192
[chuckles]
