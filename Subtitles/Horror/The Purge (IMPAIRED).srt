Mr. Falk? James Sandin.
I talked to John over at repairs...

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,040
and he took care of it.
It's all fine

3
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,980
The system is working without a hitch,
you're going to be locked in tight tonight.

4
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,170
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, Mr. Falk, safe night.

<i>- James Sandin's Office.</i>
- Sue, I took care of Falk.

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,220
What do you know?
You hear anything?

7
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,240
You're number one, Mr. Sandin.
You got it, sir.

8
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,370
- You come out on top.
- Thank you very much. </ I>

9
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,290
Thank you.

10
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,320
- Congratulations to you too, Susan.
- You don't have to say that.

11
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,340
No, Susan, it's a team win.

12
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,370
Thank you.

13
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,970
- Okay, safe night.
- Safe night, Mr. Sandin.

Mr. Cali!

25
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,570
- Getting in one last walk in before lockdown?
- Yes.

26
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,590
Did you do the systems check
I recommended?

27
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,100
- Of course, there are no problems.
- OK, it's the same one I use.

28
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,620
I only sale the best.

37
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,520
Wife: I'm in the kitchen.

38
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,520
What a day! What a day. Everybody
is doing security checks. It's crazy.

39
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,540
Traffic is even worst than last year

40
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,570
Something smells good.

41
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
Great!

42
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,640
I'll put them in the water,
they look dry.

- In their room, of course.

44

- Dinner isn't going to be ready for a while...

45
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,290
OK, good.

46
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,900
Well, I have to make a few phone calls.

47
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,750
- One thing.
- Yeah.

48
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,450
Zoey's is getting worse.
She has been pouting all day.

49
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,890
So, you're gonna have to do something
about the Henry situation. I can't stand it.

50
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,090
There's nothing to do with her. He is 18,
he's not getting any younger

51
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,700
She is going to have to sulk,
get over it

52
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,350
But I have some good news for all of us.
I'll tell you at dinner.

53
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,370
<i>History has proven over and over again.
We are a inherently violent species, </i>

54
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,100
<i>Wars, genocide, murders, the denial of our
true selfs is the real problem. </i>

55
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,540
<i>The Purge not only contains societal
violence to a single evening.</i>

56
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,970
<i>But the countrywide catharsis
creates a  psychological stability...</i>

57
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,170
<i>by letting us release the aggression
we all have inside of us.</i>

58
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,870
I love you.

- Let's growl.
- What?

60
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,350
- Growl.
- Why?

61
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,370
Because, everyone says
I love you and it's used...

62
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,900
and we need to find our own thing.

63
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,340
- No! I'll look silly.
- Come on.

64
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,550
- No.
- Do it. It's our way of saying " I love you".

65
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,850
Try it.
Seriously.

66
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,020
I think my dad's home.

67
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,540
I'm sorry, baby,
but you have to get going.

68
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,650
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,670
And you have to get home
before lockdown.

70
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,700

I come bearing gifts.

77
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,590
What have I done to deserve
a gift, Grace?

78
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,500
I was baking and I made way too many cookies.
Hi Grace!

79
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,640
- Hi!
- Ohhh cookies! I hope you're hungry.

80
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,670
Those cookies are crazy good.

81
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,690
They're lovely.

82
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,720
To have a safe night,
ladies.

83
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,740

- Goodbye!

Thank you, Grace.

85

Whatcha you mean?

90
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,290
You know your husband sold a new
security system

91
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,320
to almost every home in this community.

92
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,920
Some people are actually saying that...

93
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,370
this neighborhood paid for...
that new edition on your home.

94
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,390
Are people really saying that?

95
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,000
Relax, it's just some good ole
neighbor gossip. Don't worry about it.

96

You're too sensitive.

So, are you having your
annual party, Grace?

98
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,020
No, too much trouble. We just going to
lockdown, and watch some Purge event special...

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,020
Thanks for the cookies.

100

You scared me to death.

You can't keep creeping up
on me like that, Charlie.

You're gonna give me a heart attack?

110
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,540
I'm sorry, Mom.
Check it out. I made some adjustments, look!

111
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,570
I installed a night vision program...

112
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,090
and I insulated this motor so
you can now barely hear him.

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,720
And you can now play music to
accompany him on his missions.

Let's go! This way!

314
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:27,370
Come on, hurry!

315
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,400
Hurry, hurry!

316
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,840
What the hell?

317
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,450
Charlie! Charlie!

318
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,890
This way! Hurry!

319
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,500
Go! Go!

320
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,520
Faster!

321
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,100
What's going on?

322
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,600
Mr. Sandin?

323
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,620
Jesse he has a gun!
Henry has a gun!

324
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,100
Henry!

325
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,120
Henry! Oh, God!

326
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,150
Are you hit?

327
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:25,590
- Is Zoey alright? I didn't hit Zoey, did I?
- No, she's fine.

328
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,200
Zoey! Zoey!

329
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,640
- Mom, what's going on?
- Charlie...

330
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,250
Where is he? Where is the man?

331
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,690
I don't know.

332
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,720
I don't understand. Who is he?
Why did you let him in our home?

333
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,340
He was hurt. He called for help.
No one was helping.

334
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,770
Charlie, Jesus Christ, what the hell?

335
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,370
We have no idea what this man is capable of.

336
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,820
James he's gone, we don't know
what Henry might do...

337
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,420
we're not safe here,
and we don't know where Zoey is.

338
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,450
You're right, let's go.

339
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,470
Come, come, come.
Let's go.

340
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,500
Henry!

341
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,520
Henry, you're...

342
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,550
Henry!

343
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,550
Why?

344
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,570
Henry!

345
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,100
OK.

346
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,540
Here's the plan.

347
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,150
You two stay put here
and I'll just...

348
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,590
I'll go out there,
and I'm going to find Zoey...

349
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,620
and I'm going to bring her back here.

350
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,640
- Henry tried to kill you.
- Mary...

351
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,670
I've got to make sure she's OK.

352
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,690
Okay? I have too.

353
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,320
He didn't shoot me.

354
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,740
I'll find her.

355
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,450
- I'll go.
- I can't let you go...

356
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,770
with that man out there.

357
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,790
OK, I can't let you do that.

358
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,820
Let me go get her.

359
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,840
You just stay here with Charlie.

360
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,250
- OK?
- You be careful, okay?

361
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,350
I will.

362
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,350
Zoey!

363
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,290
Zoey!

364
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,400
Zoey! Listen to me!

365
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,520
You okay, sweetheart?

366
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,120
Yeah.

367
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,300
[Zoey calling outside]

368
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,100
Charlie! Mom!

369
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,120
Charlie you wait here, I will be right on
the other side of the door.

370
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,150
Baby!
Zoey!

371
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,600
[Machine gun fire down the street]

372
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,770
Mom?

373
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,790
Zoey.

374
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,820
Are you okay? Is Charlie OK?

375
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,840
- Father all right?
- Everyone is fine.

376
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,870
I didn't know Henry
was going to do that.

377
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,890
I didn't know that he wanted
to kill him.

378
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,920
- Why would he do that?
- Mom?

379
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,940
Charlie, give me a second....

380
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,970
He's died.

381
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,990
Mom?

382
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,020
Charlie, give me a second.

383
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,620
- Zoey, let's see what Charlie wants.
- Mom, now!

384
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,520
What is it, baby?

385
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,540
- You wanna see this.
- Tell Dad that I'm sorry.

386
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,150
Zoey!

387
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,850
Zoey!

388
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,770
Henry is dead.

389
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,990
I killed him.

390
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,020
I know, I saw Zoey.

391
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,040
- Is she OK? She alright?
- She's not hurt.

392
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,650
I couldn't get her to come with me.

393
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,100
What are we going to do?

394
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,270
I have to show you something.

395
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,870
Oh, god.

396
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,100
Now that one is saying something.

397
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,120
Good evening, Mr. Sandin.

398
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,150
Your home tells me that you are
good folks, just like us.

399
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,470
One of the haves.

400
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,590
And the blue flowers tell me
that you support the Purge.

401
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,200
We willing to treat you fairly,
so, listen closely.

402
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:50,620
Let me introduce us!
We are some fine, loyal, very educated,

403
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,250
guys and gals.

404
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,270
We have gotten gussied up these terrifying disguises...

405
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,300
as we do every year...

406
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,270
ready to violate,

407
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,870
and annihilate,
to cleanse our souls.

408
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,900
But things took a turn.

409
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,920
Our target escaped us, and...

410
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:18,500
So, one of your good neighbors
informed us that you...

411
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,940
the Sandin's...

412
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:24,550
have inexplicably given him sanctuary.

413
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,570
The man you shelter is nothing
but a dirty, homeless pig.

414
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,520
A good testimony of a just society who
has audacity to fight back.

415
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,120
Killing one of us as
we attempted to execute him tonight.

416
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,570
The pig doesn't know his place,

417
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,590
and now he needs to
be taught a lesson.

418
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,200
We need you to return him to us.

419
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,220
Alive.

420
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,250
So that we may Purge
as we are entitled.

421
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,350
Here's the plan, Sandins!

422
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,600
You have to provide us with permission
to break into your home.

423
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,270
If you don't...

424
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:07,870
If you don't, we're going to come in
and release the beast on him

425
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,320
And on you.

426
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,340
And ah...

427
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,950
We can enter any home we want.

428
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,390
And we will want...

429
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,000
As long as we want
on this fine night.

430
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,850
Don't force us to hurt you.

431
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,870
We don't want to hurt one
of our own.

432
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,500
Please, just let us Purge!

433
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,520
Toodaloo, Sandins.

434
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,100
Cut it, cut it now!

435
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,500
C'mon, let's work on the back-up.

436
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,520
The powers down
over the whole house.

437
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,550
They can't get here, right?
They can't get into our house.

438
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,990
I don't know, it's hard to say.

439
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,600
You don't know?

440
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,040
You sell these security systems.
What do you mean you don't know?

441
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,070
We have tested the system.
It works 99% of the time.

442
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,090
It looks good. It's strong,
it keeps people away.

443
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,120
It looks good.

444
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,140
It's not built for
worst case scenarios.

445
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,570
It is impenetrable?

446
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,270
No, nothing is impenetrable.

447
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,800
Things like this are not suppose to
happen in our neighborhood.

448
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,820
But they are happening, James.

449
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,850
They're happening right now.
Do you see this?

450
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,870
Listen, sit down, just sit down.
Please, we've got to calm down.

451
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,020
Okay, sit down, sit down, listen.

452
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,440
To answer your question,

453
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,570
Yes, they could get into here.

454
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,090
OK, they could tunnel underneath us.

455
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,120
They could smoke us out.

456
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,140
Improvise a battering ram.

457
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:06,170
OK, I'm sorry, but it's true.

458
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,770
So, here's what we're going do.

459
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,240
We'll gonna give them
what they want.

460
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,850
We'll find that man

461
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,870
And we're gonna force him outside.

462
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,900
Now...

463
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,340
we have guns...

464
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,370
And he doesn't.

465
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,970
But they'll kill him.

466
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
Why should he die?

467
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,020
It's either him or us, Charlie.

468
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:31,500
[Girls outside taunting, shooting guns]
I bet the boys won't let us go inside.

469
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:39,500
Not killing anyone wouldn't be any fun, please!

470
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,100
Fuck!

471
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,850
Where is he?

472

There he is.

Come on,
look over here.

Come on!

477
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,100
Polite Leader:
<i>Hey, Mr. Sandin!</i>

478
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,120
<i>Sorry to interrupt,
but I must have a word.</i>

479
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,150
<i>Anybody at the front door?
I just need a moment of your time.</i>

480
00:44:57,350 --> 00:44:59,150
[Knocks on door]

481
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,650
There you are.

482
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,370
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

483
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,100
Tell me, why haven't you delivered
the filthy swine yet?

484
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,120
Are you protecting him?

485
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,870
I certainly hope not, Mr. Sandin.

486
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,170
No, of course not.

487
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,200
I just can't find him.

488
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,990
You see, this is a misunderstanding.

489
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,020
My son let him in, he's a young boy
who doesn't know better.

490
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,440
But I support what occurs
here tonight, 100%.

491
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,070
OK? I sell security equipment.

492
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:41,090
So, I would never deny yours
or anybodies else's right to Purge.

493
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,120
You see...

494
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,720
Give us the homeless pig,
you fuck...

495
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,520
Sorry about that.

496
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,540
I don't condone that
kind of behavior.

497
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,150
Just keep in mind, Mr. Sandin...

498
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,590
he was my friend, and you...

499
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,200
...are not.

500
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,220
Our equipment is arriving soon.

501
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:12,250
And we will get him.

502
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,270
Soon after that...

503
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,300
we will need him.

504
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,850
- I'll go get him.
- You should do that.

505
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,350
Hey, Charlie.

506
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,370
I don't know what going on here.

507
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,400
There are people outside.

508
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,850
Henry is dead.

509
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,870
I'll be OK, I have his gun.

510
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,720
Stay where you are.

511
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,320
Please be safe, okay?

512
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,770
I'm gonna go hide
in your secret spot.

513
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,790
No.

514
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,400
I love you.

515
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,420
Don't.

516
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,520
Zoey?

517
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,550
Get back.

518
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,490
Into the hall. Let's go.

519
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,100
Drop your gun.

520
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,100
Dad, please.

521
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,850
Drop it.

522
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:38,870
<i>Don't hurt her. </i>

523
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,020
Zoey, I will not let him hurt you.

524
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,040
Leave her alone.

525
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,070
No, you son-of-a-bitch. I will let her go
when this night is over.

526
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,090
You're gonna get us all killed,
you know that

527
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,120
They're going to come in here,
and they are gonna kill us all.

528
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,720
They are coming here!

529
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,170
You have got to leave my family
out of this, OK?

530
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,190
If you don't drop your gun,
I will hurt her.

531
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,220
- and I will hurt you.
- We didn't do anything to you.

532
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,820
- I don't deserve this.
- I don't deserve this, either.

533
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,850
Now listen, I don't want
to hurt any of you.

534
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,870
But I am "NOT" dying tonight!

535
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,900
Drop the gun, please.
Drop it.

536
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,340
Please.

537
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,440
Listen to me, okay?

538
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,770
You are going to die tonight.

539
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,790
And you can either you die like a man and
walk outside there by yourself...

540
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,820
or you can die like a coward,

541
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,840
And get my wife and my children
killed along with you.

542
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,990
OK? So, take that gun away from
my daughter's head.

543
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,600
Shoot it, Mary!
Shoot it!

544
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,270
Oh, shit.

545
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,920
Mary! Mary! Zoey!

546
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,520
She's unconscious.

547
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:13,370
Okay.
Okay.

548
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,790
- We gonna need some rope.
- What?

549
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,420
Mary, we have to get some rope,

550
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,440
and we have to tie him up,

551
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,470
and get him outside.

552
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:24,070
And we're gonna end
this goddamn night.

553
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,020
Alright? Do you hear me?

554
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,240
OK.

555
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,570
Alright Charlie,
c'mon, help me.

556
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:32,170
Sweetheart?

557
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,000
Sweetheart.

558
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,920
I'm almost done here.
As soon as we get the legs secured.

559
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,940
Let me see.

560
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,970
You're doing great.

561
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,990
Here's what we're gonna do.

562
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,020
I'm gonna roll him into that chair
and drag him outside.

563
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,490
Okay? You got it?
You ready?

564
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,020
Charlie, concentrate
on your sister, OK?

565
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,740
In case she wakes up.

566
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,570
Charlie, I need the light.

567
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:00,170
Thank you, son.
Alright, okay.

568
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,520
Good job. You're doing great.

569
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,540
Alright, great. I'm gonna get the chair here.

570
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,250
Okay? We are almost done.

571
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:10,590
I'm gonna pick him up on the count of three.
You can help...

572
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,720
Keep the light on us, Charlie.

573
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,740
OK, one, two...

574
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,300
Three!

575
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,320
OK. Alright, get the tape
and tape him in there.

576
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:27,350
Hey, hey, hey! Quiet down, quiet down!
I got it. I got it, OK!

577
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,600
Alright, alright! You gotta calm down!
He's gonna break the tape!

578
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,040
- Cut his wound.
- What?

579
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,650
Get the letter opener and open his wound!

580
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,670
Get the letter opener,
I said!

581
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,920
- Grab the letter opener!
- No! Mom!

582
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:48,520
I'm just trying to protect my family.

583
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,100
Calm down!

584
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,040
- Mom!
- Come on, Mary, do it!

585
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,990
Do it, Mary! Do it!
Right on his wound!

586
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,020
Yes, yes.

587
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,040
Want to do it again?

588
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:04,070
Mom!
Stop!

589
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,090
Do it!

590
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,700
Alright, alright!

591
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,500
Cut!
Cut!

592
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,520
You gonna sit in the chair?

593
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,520
Now he's ready,
help me up, help me up!

594
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,570
Alright, alright.

595
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,170
OK, OK,
I got it.

596
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,020
Stay right there, alright?
Stop it.

597
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,040
Just let me tape you
to this chair, alright?

598
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:31,650
Mary, where's the tape?

599
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,890
You are making it much more difficult...

600
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,120
than it needs to be.

601
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,140
Do you understand me?

602
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,750
Alright,
alright.

603
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,350
Look at this! Look at this man!
Look at what we're doing to him.

604
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,350
Come on Mary,
let's get this over with.

605
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,000
Come on, Mary!

606
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,770
- Look at me!
- I can't.

607
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:25,790
Yes, you can, baby.
Baby, I need you right now.

608
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,520
OK. Hey! Look at me! Huh...

609
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,420
Mary!
Mary?

610
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,520
We don't have no other choice.

611
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,140
This is so wrong.

612
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,570
Baby!

613
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,590
- This is so wrong.
- We don't have no other choice.

614
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,890
Don't touch me.
OK, look at you!

615
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,920
No, no.

616
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,000
Don't touch me.

617
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:48,150
When did this happen?

618
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:55,350
James, look at you.

619
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:58,370
What the hell happened
with us, James?

620
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,400
Charlie!

621
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,850
Charlie!
Baby, where did you go?

622
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,870
Charlie!

623
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,020
Charlie!

624
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,290
Charlie, where... ?

625
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,900
Charlie!

626
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,850
Zoey.

627
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:38,870
Hey, are you alright?

628
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,600
Sit down, sit down. You hit your head.
Are you okay?

629
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,620
Good!

630
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,670
I'm so sorry about Henry.

631
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,390
Okay?

632
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,520
I'm so sorry.

633
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,140
But we're going to make it through tonight

634
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,170
We will and ...

635
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,770
everything is going to be OK.

636
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,220
No, it...

637
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,820
What?

638
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,920
Look at what you doing.
