00:00:07,526 --> 00:00:09,793
Mr. Grayson has offered me
a position in his firm.

00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:10,961
I want you to tell me

00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:12,629
everything you know
about Lord Laurent.

00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:22,605
I presume you have no objection
to my deployment of the seers.

12

There is a vampire in London.

You shall find him forthwith.

14
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:30,413
He detected them
and then employed

15
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,615
some kind of countermeasure.

16
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:35,785
I will track him,
and I will destroy him.

Why engage Harker to bring
the woman into your orbit?

18
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:41,123
Surely you have the power
to simply take her.

19
00:00:41,157 --> 00:00:42,791
To turn her
into as such as I am,

20
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:45,109

It's been over a century since
I last put fingers to keys.

38
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:37,979
I was thinking
about Lady Jayne Wetherby

39
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:41,716
and her decidedly unwholesome
avocation.

It stretches credulity to think
she's unaffiliated with the Order.

44
00:04:52,528 --> 00:04:54,495
I would tend to agree, sir.

45
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,132
But then she is a female.

46
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:02,001
I suppose I shall have
to ascertain it

in wasting a single minute more

he turned out to be.

Not when you could be having fun

Dr. Murray,
I have two young relatives

70
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,427
under my charge,
sharp, young minds,

71
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:17,129
but lately they've experienced
a great, psychic strain.

72
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:21,667
I understand, in your capacity
as director of this institution,

73
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:25,236
that you've had the privilege
of serving as an alienist

74
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:28,106
to certain individuals of high renown.

75
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,509
I have treated a number
of public figures.

76
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:33,512
You understand of course
that I can't divulge...

77
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:37,348
No, no, your reputation
for discretion precedes you.

78
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:39,584
Which is why I'm here.

79
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:42,119
Not for myself naturally,

80
00:07:42,153 --> 00:07:44,388
but for close relations

81
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,493
who wish to remain anonymous.

82
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:51,362
Please, how may I be of service?

83
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:53,830
You should be able to meet

without a problem, Mr. worth.

85
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:59,536
Are you suggesting we dedicate
the entirety of our operation

86
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,971
to the needs of a single client?

87
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:03,339
No.

88
00:08:03,374 --> 00:08:05,842
But I think he is.

89
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:10,145
Get out of my office now,
both of you.

90
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:19,054

Though I must regretfully

91
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:22,892
inform you that your employment
here is terminated,

You don't have the authority
to dismiss me.

You're nothing more
than a rich man's novelty

I wouldn't even let
into my home.

I speak with his authority.

I'll give you a second chance
to do as you're told.

Mr. Grayson's trust,
not to mention generosity,

107

your undivided attention

There's no excuse.

I provided a list of individuals

111
00:09:23,081 --> 00:09:25,415

to foster friendships with.

113
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm sure you recognize
most of the names on the list.

And, Harker...

115
00:09:32,423 --> 00:09:36,393
Never again presume
to defend me to anyone.

If you wish, I'd be happy
to mix a stimulant.

00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:48,437
Now may I inquire
as to your client's name?

118
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:51,407
I'd rather not say.

119
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:56,111
Please, doctor,
indulge a humble academic.

120
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,318
Well, professor,
I suppose I can rely

121
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,654
on your discretion?

122
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:12,559
She is Lady Jayne Wetherby.

123
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,865
Ah.

00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:20,801

a new drug for her seers.

Yes.

I'm certain of it.

128
00:10:29,877 --> 00:10:32,350
Give it to her.

129
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:40,120
Well, if you insist,
I'll concoct a serum

130

of inadequate potency.

131
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:47,192

a new solution elsewhere
