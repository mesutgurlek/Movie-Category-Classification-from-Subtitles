1
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,195  X1:272 X2:446 Y1:422 Y2:447
Hey. Hey, hey.

2
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,754  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:422 Y2:442
Come here. Take a look at this.

3
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,911  X1:319 X2:399 Y1:422 Y2:442
What?

4
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,238  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:422 Y2:474
- What is it?
- It's a data stream from PS12.

5
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,148  X1:213 X2:504 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Where is she?
- Right above sector 14.

6
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,236  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:422 Y2:447
There isn't anything in sector 14.

7
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,316  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:422 Y2:442
There is now.

8
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,110  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Hello?
- Miss Woods. Pleasure to speak to you.

9
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,674  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Who is this?
- My name's Maxwell Stafford.

10
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,109  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:422 Y2:447
I represent Weyland Industries.

11
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,470  X1:133 X2:585 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Let me guess. He's suing us again?
- You misunderstand.

12
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,311  X1:080 X2:637 Y1:422 Y2:479
Mr Weyland has offered to fund your
foundation for a year, if you'll meet with him.

13
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,793  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:422 Y2:442
When?

14
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,353  X1:291 X2:426 Y1:422 Y2:442
Tomorrow.

15
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,793  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:422 Y2:479
Tomorrow's gonna be a problem.
Take me a week to get back to the world.

16
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,071  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:422 Y2:447
Yes, I told Mr Weyland that.

17
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,668  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:422 Y2:442
He said he didn't have a week.

18
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,595  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:422 Y2:447
We must be right on top of it.

19
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,989  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:422 Y2:446
What is it, Sebastian?

20
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,957  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:422 Y2:479
The burial chamber is here.
I know it. We are gonna find it.

21
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,675  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:422 Y2:479
I know it too, but without a crew
and a permit we're out of business.

22
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,555  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:422 Y2:479
Hold the team together for two days.
I'll go to Mexico City and I'll talk to the bank.

23
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,716  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:422 Y2:447
I'll get us more money.

24
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,674  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:422 Y2:479
I might be able to help you
accomplish that, Professor.

25
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,075  X1:263 X2:455 Y1:422 Y2:447
Do I know you?

26
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,712  X1:140 X2:578 Y1:422 Y2:447
In exchange for a little of your time.

27
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,830  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:422 Y2:474
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should've switched the flash off.

28
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,520  X1:142 X2:576 Y1:422 Y2:447
There's your magazine. Excuse me.

29
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,392  X1:295 X2:422 Y1:422 Y2:442
That's OK.

30
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,751  X1:124 X2:592 Y1:422 Y2:474
I'm documenting the trip for my boys.
This is them.

31
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,189  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:422 Y2:447
Jacob and Scotty.

32
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,910  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:422 Y2:479
Would you mind taking a picture?
Thank you.

33
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,079  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:422 Y2:479
Just wanna show them
that their dad wasn't always so boring.

34
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,316  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Smile.
- OK.

35
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,515  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:422 Y2:479
- There you go.
- Thank you.

36
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,393  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:422 Y2:447
I'm Graeme Miller. I'm a chemical engineer.

37
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,637  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:422 Y2:479
Alexa Woods,
environmental technician and guide.

38
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,479  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:422 Y2:478
- Do you work for Weyland?
- Oh, no.

39
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,673  X1:135 X2:580 Y1:422 Y2:479
No, I split my time between working
for a small environmental group

40
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,951  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:422 Y2:479
and taking scientists
on expeditions on the ice.

41
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,356  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:422 Y2:479
Lex. Buckle up.
We're gonna hit some turbulence.

42
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,835  X1:276 X2:442 Y1:422 Y2:446
Thanks, Jack.

43
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,269  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Of my dad's.

44
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,391  X1:149 X2:568 Y1:422 Y2:447
He trained most of the pilots here.

45
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,149  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Just passed the PSR.
- Oh, damn. I wish I'd got a picture.

46
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,029  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Of what?
- The PSR.

47
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,709  X1:090 X2:628 Y1:422 Y2:447
I wish he'd called it out before we passed it.

48
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,071  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:422 Y2:447
The PSR is the point of safe return.

49
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,159  X1:132 X2:584 Y1:422 Y2:474
It means we've used up half our fuel,
so we can't turn back.

50
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,080  X1:134 X2:581 Y1:422 Y2:479
Right, but if something went wrong,
we could land, presumably.

51
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,430  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:422 Y2:474
- We could ditch.
- Yeah. Ditch.

52
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,315  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:422 Y2:474
But the temperature of the water
would kill us in three minutes.

53
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,239  X1:131 X2:587 Y1:422 Y2:447
Welcome aboard, everybody. Please.

54
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,429  X1:139 X2:579 Y1:422 Y2:479
Some of you may be wondering
why this team has been assembled.

55
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,994  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:422 Y2:447
Your host will give you the answer now.

56
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,156  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:422 Y2:447
Mr Weyland.

57
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,150  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:422 Y2:479
Seven days ago, one of my satellites
over Antarctica hunting for mineral deposits

58
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,308  X1:121 X2:595 Y1:422 Y2:478
discovered a sudden heat bloom
beneath the earth, which outlined this.

59
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,954  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:422 Y2:442
The red lines indicate solid walls.

60
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,237  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:422 Y2:479
Through thermal mapping, we've generated
a three-dimensional image of the structure.

61
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,310  X1:086 X2:630 Y1:422 Y2:474
It's massive, containing hundreds of rooms,
all built around a central core.

62
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,715  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:422 Y2:447
My experts tell me it's a pyramid.

63
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,629  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:422 Y2:474
What they can't agree on
is who built it and when.

64
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,799  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:422 Y2:474
One expert tells me this has features
reminiscent of the Aztecs.

65
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,434  X1:097 X2:621 Y1:422 Y2:447
Another tells me it's probably Cambodian.

66
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,758  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:422 Y2:479
What they all agree on is that
the smooth side is definitively Egyptian.

67
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,031  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:422 Y2:474
- I think your experts are right.
- Which one?

68
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,630  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:422 Y2:479
- All of them.
- Meaning what, exactly?

69
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,678  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:422 Y2:474
This pyramid contains
the features of all three cultures.

70
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,758  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:422 Y2:447
This might be the first pyramid ever built.

71
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,271  X1:207 X2:511 Y1:422 Y2:479
- But built by whom?
- By the first civilisation.

72
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,552  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:422 Y2:447
Thank you.

73
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,672  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:422 Y2:479
But how could anyone possibly
build a pyramid out here?

74
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,519  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:422 Y2:447
Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice.

75
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,589  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:422 Y2:479
- It's likely the continent was once habitable.
- I can't tell you who built it.

76
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,996  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:422 Y2:479
But if I could take a sample from it,
I can tell you how old it is.

77
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,430  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:422 Y2:479
Dr Miller, I'm offering
to put you right next to this thing.

78
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,155  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:422 Y2:474
- What caused the heat bloom?
- I don't know.

79
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,590  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Where exactly on the ice is this?
- Bouvetoya Island.

80
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,395  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:422 Y2:446
But it's not on the ice. It's 2,000ft below it.

81
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,874  X1:278 X2:440 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Mr Quinn?
- Mr Stafford.

82
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,471  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:422 Y2:479
You're looking at the best drilling team in the
world. We'll chew to that depth in seven days.

83
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,478  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:422 Y2:479
Add three weeks on top of that
to train everyone here.

84
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,478  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:422 Y2:446
We don't have that kind of time, Ms Woods.

85
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,273  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:422 Y2:474
I'm not the only one
with a satellite over Antarctica.

86
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,755  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:422 Y2:442
Others will be here soon.

87
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,237  X1:108 X2:610 Y1:422 Y2:479
Maybe I wasn't clear.
No one in this room is ready for this trip.

88
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,635  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:422 Y2:447
That's why I asked you here.

89
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,356  X1:076 X2:641 Y1:422 Y2:479
Bouvetoya is one of the world's most isolated
places. The nearest land is 1,000 miles away.

90
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,917  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:422 Y2:479
- There's no help if we run into trouble.
- You're right. It's a no-man's-land.

91
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,713  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:422 Y2:442
But the train has left the station.

92
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,799  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:422 Y2:479
And I think I speak
for everyone aboard this ship.

93
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,717  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:422 Y2:442
This is worth the risk.

94
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,194  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:422 Y2:447
Find another guide.

95
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,715  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:422 Y2:479
I've spoken with Mr Weyland.
Money's been wired to your account.

96
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,991  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:422 Y2:447
Chopper's refuelling to fly you home.

97
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,509  X1:261 X2:456 Y1:422 Y2:447
Who'd you get?

98
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,756  X1:256 X2:462 Y1:422 Y2:442
Gerald Murdoch.

99
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,515  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Come in.
- Murdoch has two seasons of ice time.

100
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,358  X1:268 X2:450 Y1:422 Y2:447
He's not ready.

101
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,278  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Don't worry about it.
- What about Paul Woodman?

102
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,517  X1:089 X2:628 Y1:422 Y2:479
- We called him.
- He gave the same bullshit answer you did.

103
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,039  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:422 Y2:442
"Bullshit"?

104
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,509  X1:077 X2:640 Y1:422 Y2:479
What I told you in there wasn't bullshit. If you
rush this, people will get hurt. Maybe die.

105
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,155  X1:092 X2:625 Y1:422 Y2:479
I don't understand.
We're not asking you to take us up Everest.

106
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,034  X1:129 X2:589 Y1:422 Y2:479
We need you to take us from the ship
to the pyramid, and back. That's it.

107
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,118  X1:153 X2:565 Y1:422 Y2:479
- What about inside the pyramid?
- Don't worry about that.

108
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,472  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:422 Y2:479
Once we're on the site, we have the best
technology and experts that money can buy.

109
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,431  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Is this new?
- It's the latest.

110
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,190  X1:151 X2:565 Y1:422 Y2:479
Mr Weyland, when I lead my team
I don't ever leave my team.

111
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,390  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:422 Y2:447
I admire your passion.

112
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,392  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:422 Y2:447
I wish you were going with us.

113
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,636  X1:204 X2:514 Y1:422 Y2:447
You're making a mistake.

114
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,636  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:422 Y2:447
It's in the upper atmosphere.

115
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,120  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:422 Y2:474
Streams of protons
and electrons from the sun

116
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,677  X1:114 X2:601 Y1:422 Y2:479
being deflected by the earth's magnetic
field, causing a solar radiation storm.

117
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,396  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:422 Y2:479
Shackleton called Antarctica
"the last greatjourney left to man".

118
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,230  X1:152 X2:562 Y1:422 Y2:474
It's the one place left in the world
that no one owns.

119
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,316  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:422 Y2:447
It's completely free.

120
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,789  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:422 Y2:447
Me, I'm sort of partial to the penguins.

121
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,110  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:422 Y2:447
I wish you'd reconsider coming with us, Lex.

122
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,199  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:422 Y2:479
Come on, don't make me pull out
pictures of my kids again.

123
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,311  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:422 Y2:442
Your kids aren't that cute.

124
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,399  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:422 Y2:479
What if we got pictures
of other people's kids?

125
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,114  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:422 Y2:447
Want my advice?

126
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,830  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:422 Y2:447
Stay on the boat.

127
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,191  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:422 Y2:447
OK. Let me ask you something.

128
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,593  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:422 Y2:479
Do we stand a better chance
of surviving with you

129
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,076  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:422 Y2:442
or with the number-two choice?

130
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,759  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:422 Y2:447
Miss Woods, your helicopter's refuelled.

131
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,348  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:422 Y2:447
They're waiting for you.

132
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,348  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:422 Y2:447
Everybody, listen up!

133
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,630  X1:274 X2:444 Y1:422 Y2:442
Gather round.

134
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,148  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:422 Y2:479
Told you she'd stay.
She can't resist my animal magnetism.

135
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,430  X1:166 X2:552 Y1:422 Y2:447
Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up.

136
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,073  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:422 Y2:442
Gentlemen?

137
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,275  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:422 Y2:479
It is my job to keep you alive
on this expedition,

138
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,595  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:422 Y2:447
and I need your help to do that.

139
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,872  X1:084 X2:634 Y1:422 Y2:479
Since I don't have time to properly train you,
I'm laying down three rules.

140
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,312  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:422 Y2:447
One. No one goes anywhere alone, ever.

141
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,510  X1:329 X2:388 Y1:422 Y2:442
Two.

142
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,031  X1:201 X2:517 Y1:422 Y2:474
Everyone must maintain
constant communication.

143
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,516  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:422 Y2:447
Three. Unexpected things are gonna happen.

144
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,757  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:422 Y2:447
When they do, no one tries to be a hero.

145
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,915  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:422 Y2:442
Understood?

146
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,792  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:422 Y2:442
Understood?

147
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,354  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good.

148
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,788  X1:074 X2:644 Y1:422 Y2:479
Seven seasons on the ice
and I've never seen a gun save someone's life.

149
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,435  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:422 Y2:479
- I don't plan on using it.
- Then why bring it?

150
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,630  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:422 Y2:447
Same principle as a condom.

151
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,072  X1:147 X2:569 Y1:422 Y2:474
I'd rather have one and not need it
than need it and not have one.

152
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,269  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:422 Y2:447
I'm glad that you decided to stay.

153
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,397  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:422 Y2:442
Move the trucks out on the ice.

154
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,239  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:422 Y2:446
Move that. OK, let's move.

155
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,869  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:422 Y2:474
- What's with the bottle cap?
- What?

156
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,673  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:422 Y2:447
What's with the bottle cap?

157
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,391  X1:125 X2:592 Y1:422 Y2:447
This is a valuable archaeological find.

158
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,079  X1:099 X2:617 Y1:422 Y2:479
When I was a kid growing up in Italy,
you know what they call a moon that big?

159
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,756  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:422 Y2:442
La luna del cacciatore.

160
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,392  X1:320 X2:397 Y1:422 Y2:442
Brava.

161
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,478  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:422 Y2:474
- What's that?
- Hunter's moon.

162
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,110  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:422 Y2:442
Hunter's moon.

163
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,115  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:422 Y2:447
Hold it, guys.

164
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,913  X1:173 X2:544 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Keep those engines running!
- Set it down.

165
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,237  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:422 Y2:442
Move over a little further. Connors.

166
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,951  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:422 Y2:447
It's an abandoned whaling station.

167
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,757  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:422 Y2:479
According to your satellite imagery,
the pyramid is located directly beneath it.

168
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,797  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:422 Y2:447
All right, bring it up. Come on.

169
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,434  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:422 Y2:447
Spread out.

170
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,634  X1:073 X2:645 Y1:422 Y2:479
We'll use this place as a base camp. Mr Quinn,
begin drilling operations as soon as you can.

171
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,797  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:422 Y2:447
I'm on it. OK, guys, let's move out.

172
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,348  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:422 Y2:474
- What are these?
- Whale bones.

173
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,074  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:422 Y2:479
This station was abandoned in 1904.
Everyone just disappeared overnight.

174
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,078  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:422 Y2:447
It was a big mystery back then.

175
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,913  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:422 Y2:447
One for National Geographic.

176
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,509  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Lex.
- No one goes anywhere alone.

177
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,519  X1:115 X2:603 Y1:422 Y2:447
There's something there. Listen. Listen.

178
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,036  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:422 Y2:447
Careful. They bite.

179
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,955  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:422 Y2:442
Over here. Over here.

180
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,672  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:422 Y2:442
What is it?

181
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,189  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:422 Y2:447
Can you believe that?

182
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,155  X1:121 X2:597 Y1:422 Y2:447
It's drilled at a perfect 30-degree angle.

183
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,478  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:422 Y2:479
- How far does it go down?
- All the way to the pyramid.

184
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,354  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:422 Y2:479
There it is. Clear as day.
And the same time yesterday...

185
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,228  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Nothing.
- How was it done?

186
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,070  X1:143 X2:575 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Thermal equipment of some kind.
- Like yours?

187
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,794  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:422 Y2:447
More advanced. Incredibly powerful.

188
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,714  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:422 Y2:447
I've never seen anything like it.

189
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,960  X1:080 X2:636 Y1:422 Y2:479
There's no team and no machine in the world
that could cut to this depth in 24 hours.

190
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,358  X1:078 X2:639 Y1:422 Y2:479
Well, the only way we're gonna know for sure
is to get down there and find out.

191
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,555  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:422 Y2:447
Look at that. Change it. Now!

192
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,678  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:422 Y2:479
OK, guys, what's taking so long?
There's a storm coming.

193
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,037  X1:178 X2:538 Y1:422 Y2:479
There's no room for sick men
on this expedition.

194
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,870  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:422 Y2:479
- My doctors tell me the worst is behind me.
- You're not a very good liar, Mr Weyland.

195
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,675  X1:104 X2:614 Y1:422 Y2:479
Stay on the ship.
We'll update you at the top of every hour.

196
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,430  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:422 Y2:479
When you get sick, you think about your life
and how you're gonna be remembered.

197
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,189  X1:117 X2:602 Y1:422 Y2:479
You know what will happen when I go?
Ten per cent fall in share prices.

198
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,675  X1:241 X2:476 Y1:422 Y2:447
Maybe 12. That's it.

199
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,273  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:422 Y2:447
I've heard this speech before.

200
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,632  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:422 Y2:474
My dad broke his leg
700ft from the summit of Mount Rainier.

201
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,829  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:422 Y2:479
He was like you.
He wouldn't go back or let us stop.

202
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,794  X1:122 X2:594 Y1:422 Y2:479
We reached the top,
and he opened a bottle of champagne.

203
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,548  X1:093 X2:625 Y1:422 Y2:447
I had my first drink with my dad at 14,400ft.

204
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,352  X1:085 X2:634 Y1:422 Y2:479
On the way down, he developed a blood clot
in his leg that travelled to his lung.

205
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,871  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:422 Y2:479
He suffered for four hours
before dying 20 minutes from the base.

206
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,238  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:422 Y2:479
You think that's the last thing
your dad remembers? The pain?

207
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,392  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:422 Y2:479
Or drinking champagne
with his daughter 14,000ft in the air?

208
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,798  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:422 Y2:442
I need this.

209
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,470  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:422 Y2:446
Come on, move.

210
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,919  X1:331 X2:387 Y1:422 Y2:442
Shit.

211
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,072  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:422 Y2:447
Mr Weyland!

212
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,350  X1:291 X2:425 Y1:422 Y2:442
Man down!

213
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,119  X1:181 X2:535 Y1:422 Y2:447
Get him! Somebody get him!

214
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,869  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:422 Y2:442
Move it!

215
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,592  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:422 Y2:442
Now!

216
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,399  X1:113 X2:605 Y1:422 Y2:479
I don't understand it.
No equipment. No sign of another team.

217
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,637  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:422 Y2:447
Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself.

218
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,034  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:422 Y2:447
Move it. Connors, get those lights up.

219
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,355  X1:261 X2:457 Y1:422 Y2:447
We have power.

220
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,234  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:422 Y2:447
Congratulations, Mr Weyland.

221
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,399  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:422 Y2:479
Looks like you'll be
leaving your mark after all.

222
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,798  X1:219 X2:499 Y1:422 Y2:447
Thank you. Thank you.

223
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,070  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:422 Y2:447
Thank you all for this.

224
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,710  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:422 Y2:447
Let's make history.

225
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,590  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:422 Y2:442
Thomas.

226
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,516  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:422 Y2:442
What is it?

227
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,076  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:422 Y2:479
- I recognise the Egyptian...
- The second symbol is Aztec.

228
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,670  X1:098 X2:619 Y1:422 Y2:447
Pre-conquest era. The third is Cambodian.

229
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,349  X1:113 X2:604 Y1:422 Y2:479
Then you were right.
The pyramid contains all three cultures.

230
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:16,033  X1:181 X2:536 Y1:422 Y2:479
- That's what it looks like.
- "You may choose to enter."

231
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,633  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:422 Y2:447
"Those who choose may enter."

232
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,955  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:422 Y2:447
Who taught you to translate?

233
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,992  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:422 Y2:447
Funny. Kinda looked like you.

234
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,396  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:422 Y2:446
Well, it's not "choose".

235
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,192  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:422 Y2:442
It's "chosen".

236
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,234  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:422 Y2:447
"Only the chosen ones may enter."

237
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,996  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:422 Y2:447
Quinn, is that you out there?

238
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,358  X1:316 X2:402 Y1:422 Y2:442
Mikkel.

239
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,748  X1:259 X2:459 Y1:422 Y2:442
What is all this?

240
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,316  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:422 Y2:442
This is the sacrificial chamber.

241
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,389  X1:147 X2:571 Y1:422 Y2:447
Like the Aztecs and the Egyptians.

242
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,230  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:422 Y2:474
Whoever built this pyramid
believed in ritual sacrifice.

243
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:40,717  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:422 Y2:479
This is where the chosen ones
were offered to the gods.

244
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,750  X1:118 X2:600 Y1:422 Y2:442
Those that were chosen would lie here.

245
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,314  X1:120 X2:598 Y1:422 Y2:447
They weren't bound or tied in any way.

246
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,314  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:422 Y2:447
They went to die willingly.

247
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,396  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:422 Y2:442
Men and women.

248
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,600  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:422 Y2:442
It was considered an honour.

249
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,280  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:422 Y2:447
Lucky them.

250
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,755  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:422 Y2:479
"They gave their lives
so the hunt could begin."

251
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,832  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:422 Y2:447
What happened here?

252
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,350  X1:173 X2:542 Y1:422 Y2:474
It's common in ritual sacrifice
to take the heart of the victim.

253
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,675  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:422 Y2:442
That's nice.

254
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,633  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:422 Y2:447
But that's not where your heart is.

255
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,559  X1:165 X2:550 Y1:422 Y2:479
Besides, it looks like the bones
were bent straight out.

256
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,078  X1:147 X2:570 Y1:422 Y2:447
Something broke out of this body.

257
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,709  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:422 Y2:474
- What have you found, Max?
- It's a shaft to another level.

258
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,272  X1:087 X2:630 Y1:422 Y2:442
Looks like there's another room down there.

259
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,556  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Let's move to that lower room.
- We're moving on, everyone.

260
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,989  X1:291 X2:427 Y1:422 Y2:442
Ms Woods.

261
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,795  X1:081 X2:637 Y1:422 Y2:479
You, stay here. Rousseau, you stay with him.
Keep a team with you.

262
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,592  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:422 Y2:447
Catalogue everything.

263
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,793  X1:296 X2:422 Y1:422 Y2:442
Professor.

264
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,910  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:422 Y2:474
This should be directly below
the sacrificial chamber.

265
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,990  X1:295 X2:423 Y1:422 Y2:442
Sebastian.

266
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,719  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:422 Y2:447
It's a sarcophagus.

267
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,236  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:422 Y2:447
This is the Long Count.

268
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,955  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:422 Y2:442
This is the Aztec calendar.

269
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:24,959  X1:082 X2:636 Y1:422 Y2:446
And this, it's some kind of combination lock.

270
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,511  X1:313 X2:405 Y1:422 Y2:447
"Days."

271
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,112  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:422 Y2:442
"Months."

272
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,196  X1:309 X2:409 Y1:422 Y2:442
"Years."

273
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,190  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:422 Y2:442
The dials are set for...

274
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,195  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:422 Y2:442
1904.

275
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,788  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:422 Y2:447
Someone opened this 100 years ago?

276
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,233  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:422 Y2:474
- What's today's date?
- October 10.

277
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,920  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:422 Y2:442
10/10/2004.

278
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,597  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- I don't know.

279
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,715  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:422 Y2:447
Back up!

280
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,154  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:422 Y2:447
Oh, my God. Take a look at this.

281
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,396  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Any idea what these are?
- No.

282
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,715  X1:318 X2:399 Y1:422 Y2:474
- You?
- No.

283
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,799  X1:101 X2:616 Y1:422 Y2:479
- It's a good thing we brought the experts.
- Well, yeah. It is a good thing.

284
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,276  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:422 Y2:474
Cos this is like finding
Moses' DVD collection.

285
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,472  X1:297 X2:421 Y1:422 Y2:447
Weyland?

286
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,560  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:422 Y2:442
A little too much excitement.

287
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,317  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:422 Y2:447
We've been out long enough for today.

288
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,718  X1:079 X2:637 Y1:422 Y2:479
We'll set up base camp at the whaling station
and get back at it tomorrow morning.

289
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,799  X1:111 X2:607 Y1:422 Y2:479
Well, you can go back to the base camp,
Ms Woods, but we're staying here.

290
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,435  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:422 Y2:479
No. You wanted to leave
without proper prep. We did.

291
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,839  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:422 Y2:479
You wanted to be the first here. We are.
You've claimed the find. It's yours.

292
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,839  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:422 Y2:479
Now, we move as a team,
and we're done for the day.

293
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,076  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:422 Y2:442
You heard her.

294
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,480  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:422 Y2:474
- What do you wanna do with these?
- Take them.

295
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,636  X1:130 X2:588 Y1:422 Y2:442
We'll run further tests on the surface.

296
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,433  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:422 Y2:442
No. No! Don't touch them.

297
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,192  X1:284 X2:432 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Watch out!
- The doors!

298
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,436  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:422 Y2:442
The door!

299
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,797  X1:295 X2:422 Y1:422 Y2:474
- You OK?
- Yeah.

300
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,432  X1:183 X2:533 Y1:422 Y2:474
Slab's gotta weigh two tons.
We'll never move it.

301
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,759  X1:111 X2:606 Y1:422 Y2:447
What did you say this room was called?

302
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,029  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:422 Y2:442
Sacrificial chamber.

303
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,828  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Rousseau.
- Tommy, come in.

304
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,598  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Come in, Rousseau.
- Come in.

305
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,759  X1:101 X2:617 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Is there anything you didn't tell me?
- Nothing. Your guess is as good as mine.

306
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,996  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:422 Y2:447
Whatever it is, we're not prepared.

307
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,352  X1:099 X2:618 Y1:422 Y2:479
We're gonna round up the rest of the team
and get to the surface. Let's move!

308
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,478  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:422 Y2:479
- What are you doing?
- My job. Yours is over.

309
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,831  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:422 Y2:479
My job is over when everyone
is back on the boat safely.

310
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,111  X1:119 X2:599 Y1:422 Y2:447
And that gun doesn't change anything.

311
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,871  X1:075 X2:643 Y1:422 Y2:479
This bearing should take us back to the
entrance. We'll regroup at the whaling station.

312
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,719  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:422 Y2:442
What about Thomas? Rousseau?

313
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,195  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:422 Y2:474
- We'll find them on the way up.
- Max?

314
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,675  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:422 Y2:446
Stone, Verheiden. Cover our backs.

315
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,156  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:422 Y2:474
The heat bloom your satellite detected
makes more sense now.

316
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,032  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:422 Y2:447
What do you mean?

317
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,357  X1:179 X2:537 Y1:422 Y2:479
A building this sophisticated
requires an energy source.

318
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,474  X1:103 X2:612 Y1:422 Y2:479
I think that's what your satellite detected.
A power plant for this pyramid firing up.

319
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,433  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Preparing.
- Preparing? For what?

320
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,551  X1:284 X2:434 Y1:422 Y2:442
Gentlemen?

321
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,436  X1:288 X2:429 Y1:422 Y2:447
Keep close.

322
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:26,911  X1:117 X2:600 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Recognise what's on their shoulders?
- Yeah.

323
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,399  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:422 Y2:479
- We worshipped these things?
- According to this, we did.

324
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,390  X1:090 X2:627 Y1:422 Y2:479
And the artefacts you removed from
the sarcophagus seem to be their weapons.

325
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:47,195  X1:117 X2:601 Y1:422 Y2:479
Let's keep moving.
Only another 200 yards to the entrance.

326
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,156  X1:289 X2:429 Y1:422 Y2:442
Take cover.

327
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,759  X1:262 X2:456 Y1:422 Y2:442
Where's Stone?

328
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,632  X1:319 X2:397 Y1:422 Y2:442
Stone!

329
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,195  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:422 Y2:447
The pyramid's shifting again.

330
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,080  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:422 Y2:447
The doors are closing. Get out.

331
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,315  X1:300 X2:418 Y1:422 Y2:442
Come on.

332
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,668  X1:280 X2:437 Y1:422 Y2:447
OK. Let's go.

333
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,677  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:422 Y2:447
Let's go. Let's go.

334
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,598  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:422 Y2:447
Hey! Verheiden!

335
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,869  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:422 Y2:442
Verheiden!

336
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,715  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:422 Y2:442
Verheiden!

337
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,918  X1:288 X2:428 Y1:422 Y2:447
Somebody!

338
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,190  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:422 Y2:447
Run! Let's go!

339
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,799  X1:338 X2:378 Y1:422 Y2:442
No!

340
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,831  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:422 Y2:447
Quickly!

341
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,111  X1:313 X2:403 Y1:422 Y2:442
No! No!

342
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,960  X1:216 X2:502 Y1:422 Y2:447
Hey! Can you hear me?

343
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,434  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:422 Y2:447
It's Connors! Where are you?

344
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,637  X1:132 X2:586 Y1:422 Y2:447
We're never getting out of this place.

345
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,470  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:422 Y2:447
Have you got any children?

346
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,510  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Got a son.
- Yeah, I've got two.

347
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,916  X1:161 X2:555 Y1:422 Y2:479
That means that we do not have
the luxury of quitting.

348
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,600  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:422 Y2:447
We're gonna make it outta here.

349
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:32,395  X1:135 X2:581 Y1:422 Y2:479
We're surviving this
if I have to carry you the whole way.

350
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,509  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:422 Y2:447
There's no way out back there.

351
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,952  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:422 Y2:479
- What's that?
- Just a theory.

352
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,153  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:422 Y2:479
The Aztec calendar was metric.
Based on multiples of ten.

353
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,797  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:422 Y2:479
I'm guessing the pyramid
reconfigures every ten minutes.

354
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,753  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:422 Y2:447
Let's stick together.

355
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,352  X1:301 X2:416 Y1:422 Y2:447
Weyland.

356
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,194  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:422 Y2:442
It would seem that we are rats in a maze.

357
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,079  X1:322 X2:396 Y1:422 Y2:447
Sorry.

358
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,754  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:422 Y2:442
Connors? Connors!

359
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,229  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:422 Y2:442
Verheiden? Verheiden?

360
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,511  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Oh, God.
- Dr Miller! Get me outta here!

361
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,235  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:422 Y2:479
It's OK. I'm gonna find a way
to get down to you. OK?

362
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,829  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:422 Y2:442
Verheiden!

363
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,712  X1:338 X2:378 Y1:422 Y2:442
No!

364
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,832  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:422 Y2:479
You want a piece of me?
You ugly son of a bitch!

365
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,639  X1:305 X2:413 Y1:422 Y2:446
Oh, God.

366
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,879  X1:301 X2:416 Y1:422 Y2:447
Weyland.

367
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,117  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:422 Y2:478
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

368
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,794  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:422 Y2:447
Leave it. They can only slow us down.

369
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,708  X1:194 X2:524 Y1:422 Y2:479
Too much has been lost
to leave here with nothing.

370
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,756  X1:277 X2:441 Y1:422 Y2:442
Give it to me.

371
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,518  X1:331 X2:387 Y1:422 Y2:442
Max.

372
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:28,829  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:422 Y2:442
Hold on.

373
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,030  X1:301 X2:416 Y1:422 Y2:442
Look out!

374
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,480  X1:144 X2:574 Y1:422 Y2:447
Come on. We have to get Weyland.

375
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,916  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:422 Y2:447
Weyland, come on.

376
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,799  X1:243 X2:475 Y1:422 Y2:479
- What were they?
- You're the expert.

377
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,673  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:422 Y2:447
I've got to stop. I've got to stop.

378
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,079  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:422 Y2:447
Take it easy. Weyland.

379
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,792  X1:288 X2:430 Y1:422 Y2:442
Look at me.

380
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,354  X1:116 X2:602 Y1:422 Y2:447
You have to slow your breathing down.

381
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,835  X1:227 X2:491 Y1:422 Y2:447
Slow, steady breaths.

382
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,395  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Weyland, come on.
- I can hardly stand.

383
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,715  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:422 Y2:447
I'm not gonna let you die down here.

384
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,149  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:422 Y2:442
You didn't.

385
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,159  X1:095 X2:622 Y1:422 Y2:479
- There's another one. We have to go. Now!
- Weyland.

386
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,999  X1:237 X2:481 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Come with us.
- Get her outta here.

387
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,509  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:422 Y2:474
- Now!
- Come on.

388
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,108  X1:330 X2:386 Y1:422 Y2:442
Run!

389
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,352  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:422 Y2:447
Don't turn your back on me.

390
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,548  X1:327 X2:390 Y1:422 Y2:442
Wait.

391
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,153  X1:300 X2:417 Y1:422 Y2:447
This way.

392
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,713  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:422 Y2:442
Go! Go!

393
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,036  X1:264 X2:454 Y1:422 Y2:442
Look over here.

394
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,872  X1:217 X2:501 Y1:422 Y2:474
- He's marking himself.
- What?

395
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,312  X1:105 X2:613 Y1:422 Y2:474
Ancient warriors would mark themselves
with the blood of their kill.

396
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,590  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:422 Y2:447
It's a rite of passage.

397
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,640  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:422 Y2:447
This is starting to make sense.

398
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,993  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:422 Y2:474
The hieroglyphs are
a little difficult to make out.

399
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,714  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:422 Y2:447
But the story is all here.

400
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:10,633  X1:112 X2:606 Y1:422 Y2:479
Thousands of years ago,
these hunters found a backwater planet.

401
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:22,639  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:422 Y2:479
They taught humans how to build
and were worshipped as gods.

402
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,709  X1:088 X2:630 Y1:422 Y2:447
Every hundred years the gods would return.

403
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,637  X1:176 X2:542 Y1:422 Y2:479
And when they did,
they would expect a sacrifice.

404
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,750  X1:075 X2:642 Y1:422 Y2:447
Humans were used to breed the ultimate prey.

405
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,237  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:422 Y2:479
The hunters would battle
with these great serpents

406
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,114  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:422 Y2:479
to prove themselves worthy
to carry the mark.

407
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,435  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:422 Y2:446
But if the hunters lost,

408
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:18,313  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:422 Y2:447
they made sure nothing survived.

409
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,474  X1:098 X2:620 Y1:422 Y2:447
An entire civilisation wiped out overnight.

410
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,309  X1:332 X2:385 Y1:422 Y2:442
So...

411
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,592  X1:093 X2:624 Y1:422 Y2:479
the humanoids, the hunters -
they brought those creatures here to hunt?

412
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,711  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:422 Y2:447
And they use us like cattle.

413
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,318  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:422 Y2:442
We're hosts for them to breed in.

414
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,750  X1:180 X2:535 Y1:422 Y2:474
The heat bloom was the sign
to lure us down here.

415
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,519  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:422 Y2:447
This whole thing was a trap.

416
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,073  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:422 Y2:446
Without us, there could be no hunt.

417
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,479  X1:330 X2:386 Y1:422 Y2:442
Shit!

418
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,511  X1:292 X2:424 Y1:422 Y2:442
Verheiden!

419
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,868  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:422 Y2:446
Oh, shit.

420
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,711  X1:145 X2:572 Y1:422 Y2:447
When that door opens, we're dead.

421
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,718  X1:195 X2:523 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Not if we set things right.
- What do you mean?

422
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,798  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:422 Y2:447
This pyramid is like a prison.

423
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:22,435  X1:114 X2:602 Y1:422 Y2:479
We took the guards' guns,
and now the prisoners are running free.

424
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,916  X1:083 X2:634 Y1:422 Y2:447
To restore order, the guards need their guns.

425
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:32,235  X1:104 X2:613 Y1:422 Y2:479
When that door opens,
we're gonna give that thing his gun back.

426
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:36,956  X1:084 X2:633 Y1:422 Y2:479
Are you crazy? During a big-game hunt, the
animals being hunted don't arm the hunters.

427
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:40,390  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:422 Y2:474
They're not hunting us.
We're in the middle of a war.

428
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,069  X1:213 X2:505 Y1:422 Y2:474
- It's time to pick a side.
- We are on our side.

429
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:50,592  X1:127 X2:590 Y1:422 Y2:479
We have to consider the possibility
that we might not make it out of here.

430
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:56,077  X1:119 X2:598 Y1:422 Y2:479
But we have to make sure
those serpents don't reach the surface.

431
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,955  X1:242 X2:476 Y1:422 Y2:447
Because if they do,

432
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,954  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:422 Y2:447
everything everywhere could die.

433
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,676  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:422 Y2:447
The enemy of my enemy...

434
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,791  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:422 Y2:447
is my friend.

435
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,275  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:422 Y2:447
Let's go find our friend.

436
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,320  X1:086 X2:631 Y1:422 Y2:447
How do you say "scared shitless" in Italian?

437
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,195  X1:102 X2:616 Y1:422 Y2:479
Non vedo I'ora di uscire con te da questa
piramide perché mi sto cagando addosso.

438
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,629  X1:280 X2:438 Y1:422 Y2:442
More or less.

439
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,193  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:422 Y2:442
Move!

440
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,273  X1:334 X2:383 Y1:422 Y2:442
Lex.

441
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,759  X1:334 X2:383 Y1:422 Y2:442
Lex.

442
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,313  X1:307 X2:410 Y1:422 Y2:442
Hold on.

443
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,478  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:422 Y2:446
Come on, Lex.

444
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,708  X1:315 X2:403 Y1:422 Y2:446
Oh, no.

445
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,755  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:422 Y2:446
Wait. Wait. Please, wait.

446
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:55,637  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:422 Y2:447
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

447
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,310  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:422 Y2:447
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

448
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,432  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:422 Y2:479
I'm coming with you.
You hear me, you ugly creature?

449
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,356  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:422 Y2:447
What are you doing?

450
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,751  X1:320 X2:396 Y1:422 Y2:442
Miller!

451
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,752  X1:320 X2:396 Y1:422 Y2:442
Miller!

452
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,188  X1:295 X2:423 Y1:422 Y2:442
Sebastian.

453
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,799  X1:161 X2:556 Y1:422 Y2:479
- Help me, Lex.
- I'm gonna get you out of there.

454
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:00,390  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:422 Y2:479
- It's too late. It's inside me.
- I'm gonna get you outta here.

455
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,670  X1:283 X2:435 Y1:422 Y2:474
- You can't...
- No!

456
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,598  X1:264 X2:452 Y1:422 Y2:442
No. No. No! No!

457
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,676  X1:245 X2:472 Y1:422 Y2:447
I have to help him.

458
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,518  X1:334 X2:383 Y1:422 Y2:442
Lex!

459
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,108  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:422 Y2:447
They mustn't reach the surface.

460
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,079  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:422 Y2:447
They mustn't reach the surface.

461
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,760  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:422 Y2:442
I know.

462
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,316  X1:326 X2:390 Y1:422 Y2:442
Do it!

463
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,876  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:422 Y2:447
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

464
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,710  X1:288 X2:430 Y1:422 Y2:442
It's a bomb.

465
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,910  X1:085 X2:632 Y1:422 Y2:447
Well, I hope it kills every fucking one of 'em.

466
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,633  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:422 Y2:447
You are one ugly mother...

467
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,638  X1:321 X2:396 Y1:422 Y2:442
Got it!

468
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:47,511  X1:134 X2:584 Y1:422 Y2:447
