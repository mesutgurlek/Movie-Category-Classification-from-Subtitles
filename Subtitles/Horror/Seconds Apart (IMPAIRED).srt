You needed a ride where?

The mall.

We told him to stop
but he just kept going.

coming until it was too late.

EVE: Help!

989
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:53,280
I can't see.

990
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,520
Can you feel it?

991
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,480
Yeah.

992
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,840
Finally.

01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,240
It's beautiful.

995
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,160
I'm scared.

996
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,240
Me, too.
