00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,931
<i>Yes.</i>

168
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,800
They were threatening
you, attacking you?

169
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:06,835
Not all of them.

170
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:08,537
<i>You save anyone?</i>

171
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,475
You saved people.

172
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,911
Pointless acts.

173
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,915
Everybody turns.

174
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:21,650
I saw a wedding ring.

175
00:21:23,953 --> 00:21:26,555
You had someone
you loved, didn't you?

176
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:30,158
Children?

177
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,327
Oh.

178
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:35,163
You loved them.

179
00:21:35,165 --> 00:21:37,466
You loved them a lot
if you're like this.

180
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,637
You saw it happen.

181
00:21:42,639 --> 00:21:45,607
<i>That's how this started, right?</i>

182
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:49,978
<i>It's all happening right in front
of your eyes over and over.</i>

183
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,613
<i>Your body's here,</i>

184
00:21:51,615 --> 00:21:53,915
but your mind is still there.

185
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:57,519
There's a door and you
want to go through it

186
00:21:57,521 --> 00:22:00,088
to get away from it, so you do

187
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,724
and it leads you
right back to that moment.

188
00:22:02,726 --> 00:22:04,493
And you see that door again

189
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:06,528
and you know it won't work,

190
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,763
but, hell, maybe it'll work.

191
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:10,031
So you step through that door

192
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,601
<i>and you're right back in that
horrible moment every time.</i>

193
00:22:12,603 --> 00:22:14,302
<i>You still feel it every time.</i>

194
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:17,239
So you just want to stop
opening that door.

195
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:19,975
So you just sit in it.

196
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:22,010
But I assure you,

197
00:22:22,012 --> 00:22:24,012
one of those doors
leads out, my friend.

198
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:26,515
I don't have any friends.

199
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:28,049
Get to know me.

200
00:22:28,051 --> 00:22:29,785
Oh, I'm gonna kill you.

201
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:32,521
- <i> Why?</i>
- Because I have to clear.

202
00:22:32,523 --> 00:22:35,490
<i>See, that's the thing.</i>
<i>You don't.</i>

203
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:38,293
(scoffs)
We're not built to kill.

204
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:41,563
We don't have claws
or fangs or armor.

205
00:22:43,199 --> 00:22:47,035
Vets that came back with PTSD,

206
00:22:47,037 --> 00:22:49,571
that didn't happen because we're
comfortable with killing.

207
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:51,973
<i>We're not.</i>
<i>We can't be.</i>

208
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:54,075
<i>We feel.</i>
<i>We're connected.</i>

209
00:22:54,077 --> 00:22:58,013
<i>You know, I've interviewed
over 825 people</i>

210
00:22:58,015 --> 00:22:59,181
who've done terrible things.

211
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:01,683
I've only met one evil person.

212
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:04,386
Some of them were born
with bad brains.

213
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:06,588
<i>Some of them got sick</i>
<i>along the way.</i>

214
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,523
<i>The rest were</i>
<i>just damaged people.</i>

215
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:11,359
Traumatized themselves like
you, but they could heal.

216
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:13,695
Some more, some less,
but they can.

217
00:23:13,697 --> 00:23:15,530
We all can.

218
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,234
I know it.

219
00:23:21,237 --> 00:23:23,705
It's all a circle and
everything gets a return.

220
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,110
The door is open.

221
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:33,915
That door right there.
The cell door, it's open.

222
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:36,184
<i>I threw the key</i>
<i>in the river a while back.</i>

223
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:38,320
<i>I'm not gonna hold you anymore.</i>

224
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:42,290
I can't stop you.
Go, clear.

225
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:44,593
Or stay, crash on the couch,

226
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:47,629
<i>and we'll try</i>
<i>to find you another way.</i>

227
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:49,831
<i>The door's open.</i>

228
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:51,566
<i>It's been open all along.</i>

229
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:59,040
You stay or you go.

230
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:01,042
Those are the choices.

231
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:04,479
I will not allow you to kill me.

232
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:06,448
I will not allow that.

233
00:24:30,272 --> 00:24:31,473
Eastman:
<i>Don't!</i>

234
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,580
<i>Stop.</i>

235
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:37,816
(growling)

236
00:24:37,818 --> 00:24:39,751
(groans)

237
00:24:39,753 --> 00:24:41,787
- Stop.
- (Morgan growling)

238
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,062
I gave you two choices.

239
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:57,235
Oh, shit.

240
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:59,438
(groans)

241
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,140
(grunting)

242
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:07,012
(choking)

243
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,698
(gasping)

244
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:55,627
Kill me.

245
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,507
I gave you two choices.

246
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:10,942
<i>The door or the couch.</i>

247
00:27:09,202 --> 00:27:11,203
<i>(hammering)</i>

248
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:17,909
That was aikido.

249
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:20,111
That's how I kicked
your ass earlier.

250
00:27:20,113 --> 00:27:22,714
Well, that's how
I redirected your ass.

251
00:27:26,052 --> 00:27:30,155
The people in prison
I evaluated for the state,

252
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:32,824
the stories I heard,

253
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:35,994
the things these people did.

254
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:38,363
<i>One night, my
five-year-old daughter</i>

255
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:43,068
<i>found me crying in the garage
after about eight beers.</i>

256
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,970
Told her I wasn't
feeling too good.

257
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:49,541
She gave me this.

258
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:58,016
She had won it at a carnival
at school that day.

259
00:27:58,018 --> 00:28:01,820
She said it'd make me lucky
and I'd feel better.

260
00:28:01,822 --> 00:28:04,823
The next morning I found
a flyer for aikido.

261
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:08,860
Damn thing worked.

262
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:12,664
Your wife and your daughter...

263
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:16,535
they're dead.

264
00:28:25,611 --> 00:28:28,346
It was aikido.

265
00:28:28,348 --> 00:28:29,915
It'll help.

266
00:28:31,183 --> 00:28:33,652
And you obviously need help

267
00:28:33,654 --> 00:28:36,354
if we're gonna make this trip.

268
00:28:36,356 --> 00:28:38,056
Can't just be
me and you to the end.

269
00:28:38,058 --> 00:28:40,659
<i>You're a shit conversationalist.</i>

270
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:44,296
<i>And I can't make</i>
<i>this trip by myself.</i>

271
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:46,064
A trip where?

272
00:28:51,737 --> 00:28:53,572
I have no idea.

273
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,213
Good night.

274
00:29:09,088 --> 00:29:11,723
<i>(door closes)</i>

275
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:13,291

<i>(birds chirping)</i>

277
00:30:02,908 --> 00:30:05,477
Grassy notes are a
little too Astroturf,

278
00:30:05,479 --> 00:30:07,479
but there's potential here.

279
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:10,048
There is always potential.

280
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,150
Where there's life,
there's potential.

281
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,954
I've been a vegetarian
for a while now.

282
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:19,758
I was afraid that damn goat
was gonna make me a vegan.

283
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,094
I don't kill, but I'm not giving
up on chocolate any time soon.

284
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:31,236
You might notice I'm not giving
up on the Goo Goo Clusters.

285
00:30:31,238 --> 00:30:32,637
They're gonna
remain on the menu.

286
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:35,974
You should try one.
They're good.

287
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:38,043
Come on, you're alive.
Live a little.

288
00:30:39,412 --> 00:30:40,845
We should go out.

289
00:30:40,847 --> 00:30:42,514
We got a lot here,

290
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:44,883
but we should scavenge
some things up for the trip.

291
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,351
You coming?

292

laid waste to a perfectly
good tomato plant.

<i>that tells you otherwise.</i>

<i>to never to do it again.</i>

332
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:38,223
Eastman:
<i>To make up for it.</i>

333
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:47,198
Morgan: <i>To still
accept what we were.</i>

334
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,040
Hey.

335
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,292
Eastman:
<i>To accept everyone.</i>

336
00:39:14,294 --> 00:39:17,629
Morgan:
<i>To protect everyone.</i>

337
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:21,266
Eastman: <i>And in doing
that, protect yourself.</i>

338
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:25,970
Morgan:
<i>To create peace.</i>

339
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:39,717
Why do you have a cell
in your cabin?

340
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:48,993
<i>Built this place with my wife</i>

341
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:51,663
<i>a while before</i>
<i>our daughter was born.</i>

342
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:53,431
It didn't have a cell back then.

343
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,433
That was just the other side
of the living room.

344
00:39:57,202 --> 00:40:00,638
In my job I interviewed
over 800 men and 25 women

345
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,974
convicted of awful things.

346
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:07,345
Stuff from the darkest part
of the human soul.

347
00:40:07,347 --> 00:40:08,913
I was evaluating a man

348
00:40:08,915 --> 00:40:12,116
by the name
of Crighton Dallas Wilton.

349
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:13,751
(chuckles)

350
00:40:13,753 --> 00:40:16,621
Name like that, sounded like
he should own an oil company

351
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,157
and wear a big hat--
Crighton Dallas Wilton.

352
00:40:21,694 --> 00:40:24,996
Despite doing some truly unspeakable
acts, he was up for parole.

353
00:40:24,998 --> 00:40:29,300
And he was one of the most damn
likable people I had ever met.

354
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,869
He said all the right
things, he went to therapy.

355
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:35,206
He wrote letters to the prison
board to start a program

356
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,608
to grow flowers
for the waiting rooms

357
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,511
in state hospitals, rest homes.

358
00:40:40,513 --> 00:40:44,849
And I saw right through him.

359
00:40:44,851 --> 00:40:46,851
Saw that he was
a true psychopath,

360
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:49,954
that he knew how to play people,
exactly how to play people.

361
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:53,157
I was interviewing him
next to the cafeteria.

362
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,226
The place smelled
of industrial pizza.

363
00:40:55,228 --> 00:40:56,661
They were polishing the floor.

364
00:40:56,663 --> 00:41:00,732
I had to shout my
questions half the time.

365
00:41:00,734 --> 00:41:02,433
And there was this moment.

366
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,205
Can't even remember
the exchange.

367
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:10,174
But right then I knew

368
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,911
that Crighton knew that I
knew exactly what he was.

369
00:41:13,913 --> 00:41:18,182
Everything he had said,
done to hide away

370
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,485
what he was from
everyone, from himself,

371
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:22,687
just slipped away, and...

372
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:26,657
and that model prisoner
of 10 years stood up,

373
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:28,926
smiled,

374
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:31,095
and just cracked me
across the face.

375
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,867
His fist felt like a rock.

376
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:39,404
Then he was on top of me and
the floor polisher next door

377
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:41,239
was thudding out every sound.

378
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:42,673
And I--

379
00:41:42,675 --> 00:41:46,878
and I saw his face,

380
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,915
his-- his eyes,

381
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:52,550
his evil.

382
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:57,088
Mask had slipped.

383
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:00,758
And he was gonna kill me
right then and there

384
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,928
because he knew I would make sure
he would never get out again.

385
00:42:18,844 --> 00:42:21,412
Arm bar counter

386
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:25,650
for being choked
from a pinned position.

387
00:42:25,652 --> 00:42:27,452
Aikido.

388
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,122
I wasn't taking it
for self-defense,

389
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:34,659
but it saved my life.

390
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:36,928
And I got to make sure
he never got out again.

391
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:42,700
Well, got to try.

392
00:42:42,702 --> 00:42:44,969
He got out.

393
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:47,271
Talked to the right people
who got him the right things

394
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,474
and he broke out,
but it wasn't to escape.

395
00:42:52,978 --> 00:42:55,279
Crighton Dallas Wilton
went to my home

396
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,816
and killed my wife,
my daughter, and my son.

397
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:04,088
He walked down the street
to the police station

398
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,558
around the corner
covered in their blood.

399
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,794
He surrendered.

400
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,498
Said the only reason
he broke out

401
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,433
was to destroy my life.

402
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,574
A year passed...

403
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,346
and he was still working
those plots.

404
00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:31,282
They just let him
work those plots

405
00:43:31,284 --> 00:43:33,718
by the roads out by 85,

406
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,888
grow chrysanthemums,
forget-me-nots.

407
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:44,862
I built that cell
with the full intention

408
00:43:44,864 --> 00:43:48,499
of bringing
Crighton Dallas Wilton here,

409
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:51,836
putting him behind those bars and
watching him starve to death.

410
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,645
And did you?

411
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,385
I have come to believe

412
00:44:07,387 --> 00:44:10,221
that all life is precious.

413
00:44:10,223 --> 00:44:12,423
Even for a man like that?

414
00:44:12,425 --> 00:44:14,625
Who did that to you?

415
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,695
To your family?

416
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:22,667
I have come to believe

417
00:44:22,669 --> 00:44:26,704
that all life is precious.

418
00:44:32,411 --> 00:44:35,213
That's why we're having
oatmeal burgers.

419
00:44:43,755 --> 00:44:45,556
You're good at it.

420
00:44:49,016 --> 00:44:50,895
Redirecting.

421
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,478
We need more gear.

422
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,247
Tarp, crowbar.

423
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:09,216
I'm thinking we could try for
the islands off the coast.

424
00:45:09,218 --> 00:45:11,118
I think people
could have gone there.

425
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,654
Hell, at the very least,
we could see the beach.

426
00:45:17,025 --> 00:45:18,859
What is it?

427
00:45:20,962 --> 00:45:23,330
I know where we can
find all that.

428
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:09,310
Who did you lose?

429
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:16,050
My wife and son.

430
00:46:19,554 --> 00:46:21,589
Who you lost.

431
00:46:21,591 --> 00:46:23,157
Their names.

432
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:35,269
Jenny and Duane.

433
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:40,241
I'm sorry.

434

Don't ever be sorry.

436
00:46:53,956 --> 00:46:55,523
Not here.

00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:12,391
and brought him back here.

493
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,528
If they'd have caught me,
it'd have been fine.

494
00:55:20,566 --> 00:55:22,334
It'd have been better.

495
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:30,442
But I got him here and they
didn't know where to look.

496
00:55:30,444 --> 00:55:31,843
(exhales)

497
00:55:31,845 --> 00:55:33,378
You gotta sit down.

498
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,982
All right.
(winces)

499
00:55:36,984 --> 00:55:38,517
I'm okay.

500
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,258
(exhales)

501
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,563
I put him in that cell...

502
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,133
and I let him starve to death.

503
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,805
It took 47 days.

504
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:07,913
And then I was gone.

505
00:56:07,915 --> 00:56:10,582
I was where you were.

506
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:13,885
And I wasn't trying to open
up the door anymore either.

507
00:56:15,755 --> 00:56:19,090
What I did to him,

508
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:21,226
it didn't give me any peace.

509
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:25,330
I found my peace

510
00:56:25,332 --> 00:56:28,767
when I decided
to never kill again.

511
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:34,005
To never kill anything again.

512
00:56:36,609 --> 00:56:38,343
When I decided to settle things,

513
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:41,780
I went back to Atlanta
to turn myself in.

514
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:44,449
That's how I found out
the world ended.

515
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,855
But the world hasn't ended.

516
00:56:54,927 --> 00:56:56,761
Progress.

517
00:57:05,242 --> 00:57:08,277
My daughter drew this on the
hallway wall of our house.

518
00:57:08,279 --> 00:57:10,446
She thought I'd get mad.

519
00:57:10,448 --> 00:57:12,448
I just put a frame around it.

520
00:57:15,585 --> 00:57:19,188
After I went back, when I found
out I couldn't turn myself in

521
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:22,057
because there was no one
to turn myself in to,

522
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:25,461
I went back home
to cut this from the wall.

523
00:57:25,463 --> 00:57:28,431
I lost the car on the way back.

524
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:30,833
I walked through
30 miles of the dead

525
00:57:30,835 --> 00:57:33,669
for a piece of drywall.

526
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:36,672
(laughs)

527
00:57:36,674 --> 00:57:38,941
Scariest thing I ever did.

528
00:57:40,944 --> 00:57:43,145
Best thing I ever did.

529
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,450
(sighs)

530
00:57:47,452 --> 00:57:49,552
You can stay here.

531
00:57:49,554 --> 00:57:53,155
You have enough food,
power, security.

532
00:57:53,157 --> 00:57:55,491
For the rest of your life,
you could stay here.

533
00:57:55,493 --> 00:57:58,627
But you shouldn't stay here.

534
00:57:58,629 --> 00:58:02,465
Can't expect such a splendid
guest as yourself to show up.

535
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:05,768
You stay here, you'll be alone.

536
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:09,972
You were alone.

537
00:58:09,974 --> 00:58:12,441
Everything is about people.

538
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:17,279
Everything in this life
that's worth a damn.

539
00:58:17,281 --> 00:58:20,115
It couldn't be just me.
It shouldn't be just you.

540
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:25,488
Hell, Tabitha's gone now.

541
00:58:29,392 --> 00:58:31,660
(sighs) I'm ready.

542
00:58:33,363 --> 00:58:35,664
I have a gun in
the lockbox out there.

543
00:58:40,003 --> 00:58:41,537
Here.

544
00:58:45,709 --> 00:58:48,210
(labored breathing)

545
00:58:48,212 --> 00:58:50,079
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

546
00:58:59,523 --> 00:59:02,157
Hope it's lucky for you, too,

547
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,260
whatever you decide.

548
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,097
I've decided.

549
01:01:35,812 --> 01:01:37,880
And that's it.

550
01:01:39,349 --> 01:01:41,417
Every last bit.

551
01:01:45,188 --> 01:01:48,190
You think it can work out
that way with me?

552
01:01:48,192 --> 01:01:51,160
Yes.

553
01:01:51,162 --> 01:01:52,695
I think it can.

554
01:01:54,564 --> 01:01:57,032
(chuckles)

555
01:01:57,034 --> 01:01:59,368
Maybe.

556
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:02,671
You noticed
I'm shaking a little?

557
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,575
Sweating a little?

558
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:14,183
Oh, man.

559
01:02:14,185 --> 01:02:16,618
<i>(sighs)</i>

560
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,987
<i>I saw how settled this place was</i>

561
01:02:18,989 --> 01:02:20,789
in the pictures I found.

562
01:02:22,859 --> 01:02:26,409
I thought maybe there'd
be something here.

563
01:02:27,531 --> 01:02:30,833
Medicine to help this.

564
01:02:33,515 --> 01:02:36,538
But that was before
you people won.

565
01:02:39,309 --> 01:02:44,113
So I know I'm probably
going to die.

566
01:02:44,115 --> 01:02:46,148
But if I don't...

567
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:51,386
I am going to have
to kill you, Morgan.

568
01:02:51,388 --> 01:02:56,158
<i>I'm going to have to kill</i>

569
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,762
<i>Every one of them.</i>
<i>The children, too.</i>

570
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:03,999
Just like your friend
Eastman's children.

571
01:03:06,936 --> 01:03:08,604
Those are the rules.

572
01:03:08,606 --> 01:03:10,973
<i>That's my code.</i>

573
01:03:10,975 --> 01:03:13,075
<i>I'd say I'm sorry,</i>

574
01:03:13,077 --> 01:03:15,677
but you said it, right?

575
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,381
Don't ever be sorry.

576
01:03:53,516 --> 01:03:55,818
(keys jingle)

Rick:

01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,794
<i>Open the gate!</i>
