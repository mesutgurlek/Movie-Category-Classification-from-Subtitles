It's about this entity,

By storytellers, of all things.

I mean, every so often they imagine a story
good enough to sort of catch its essence...

it's held prisoner in the story.

...or somebody waters it down
to make it an easier sell.

You know, or maybe it's just so upsetting
to society that it's banned outright.

that gave Nancy her strength...

he's got to come through you.

to do that at your most vulnerable points.

"We open on an old wooden bench.

01:43:18,509 --> 01:43:22,596
There's fire and tools
and a man's grimy hands...

1326
01:43:22,764 --> 01:43:27,434
...building what soon is revealed
as a gleaming set of claws.

1327
01:43:27,602 --> 01:43:29,978
And the claws are moving now...

1328
01:43:30,146 --> 01:43:35,025
...as if awakening
from a long and unwanted sleep.

1329
01:43:35,193 --> 01:43:39,196
Then the man lays one trembling hand
flat upon the table...

1330
01:43:39,363 --> 01:43:43,408
...and with his other,
picks up a thick, sharp blade.

1331
01:43:43,576 --> 01:43:48,163
Behind the lights,
faces watch from the darkness...

1332
01:43:48,331 --> 01:43:53,168
...ready to laugh or scream in terror."
