00:00:01,776 --> 00:00:03,877
Garrison commander
and a promotion.

3
00:00:03,912 --> 00:00:06,013
It's probably best not to make any
plans right now.

4
00:00:06,112 --> 00:00:07,613
What do you mean?

5
00:00:07,648 --> 00:00:09,216
I don't think the timing
is right for a baby.

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,286
- Oh, my God.
- Who is that?

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,621
That's Finn's dad.

8
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:16,890
Get out!

9
00:00:16,925 --> 00:00:18,959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What did you just say?

10
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:20,920
Why is he here?

11
00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:23,930
Do not sass me. This is Whit.
He's my friend.

12
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:25,662
Like the friends you used
to have before dad?

13
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:28,036
Thanks for letting me come.

14
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:29,536
Drive safe.

15
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:33,340
Trust me. It's just colic.
(Molly crying)

16
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:36,210
I'm just saying, maybe it's worth a
trip to the doctor.

17
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,146
What you're saying is that I don't know
how to take care of my own child.

18
00:00:38,147 --> 00:00:40,046
I'm gonna go.

19
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:41,715
Don't go back
with your ex...

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,284
And don't take that job.

21
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,955
Stay here in Charleston
with me.

22
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,896
(Crying) Oh, baby, you're burning up.

23
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,028
Claudia Joy, there's something
wrong with Molly.

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,368
Can you meet me at
the emergency room?

25
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,668
(Claudia Joy)
Of course. I'm on my way.

26
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:03,637
Okay. (Sniffles)
I'm so sorry, baby.

27
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:07,540
(Woman) Heartbeat's tachy.

28
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:09,342
Pulse ox 90.
(Man) She's pale and pasty

29
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:10,677
with a sunken anterior fontanel.

30
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,013
Urine is minimal and dark.
She needs fluid resuscitation.

31
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:14,683
Normal saline bolus
at 100 cc's total.

32
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,483
I don't understand.
Why is she so dehydrated?

33
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:18,085
- Do you breastfeed?
- Every three hours.

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,388
Get a Chem panel, a CBC
and cultures. (Crying)

35
00:01:21,823 --> 00:01:24,010
Molly have any, uh,
diarrhea recently?

36
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,800
No.

37
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,126
Normal amount of wet diapers?

38
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:28,228
Actually, they were
pretty dry today.

39
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:29,863
Any projectile vomiting?

40
00:01:29,898 --> 00:01:32,290
No, no, just, um, spittiness.
I thought it was colic.

41
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,633
I can't get a flash.

42
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:34,768
(Man)
We'll put in a central line.

43
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,637
Let ultrasound know
that we're coming up

44
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:39,706
- and reserve the O.R. on standby.
- Don't worry, sweetie. Mommy's here.

45
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:42,543
Mrs. Sherwood, I'm sorry,
but you're gonna

46
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:45,245
have to wait outside.

Well, the ultrasound confirmed
what we suspected.

Uh, Molly has Pyloric Stenosis.

60
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,585
- What's that?
- It's a blockage

between the stomach
and the small intestine.

62
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:28,555

- It's often confused with colic.

63
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,757
- Yeah, still, I-I should've...
- Is it serious?

64

When the blockage
becomes complete.

Thank God for that, right?

Can I see her?

68
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:40,834
We're still correcting
her fluids and electrolytes.

69
00:02:40,868 --> 00:02:42,936

she'll need surgery.

- Without your helmet?

will cover your 1:00,

I'd call him again

Pyloric Stenosis is

- Tanya didn't.

00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:28,394
Let me guess.

161
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:31,731
Happy hour at Taco Boy?

162
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:34,700
(Spanish accent) You got
something against Taco Boy?

163
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:36,802
No, it's just that
their margaritas

164
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:40,272
make people do strange things.

165
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:44,543
(Normal voice) Yeah.

166
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:47,146
So is that a yes or a no?

167
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,148
I don't know.
Uh, maybe.

168
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:51,150
Come on, Moran.
No more maybes.

169
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:53,486
Yes or no? Up or down?

170
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,155
Salt or no salt?

171
00:06:57,591 --> 00:07:00,159
Moran?

172
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:02,361
Okay. Yes.

173
00:07:02,396 --> 00:07:03,829
And no salt.

174
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:05,698
Okay.

175
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:07,266
<i>Hasta mañana.</i>

176
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,801
<i>Hasta mañana.</i>

177
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:10,669
Hey, Red.

178
00:07:10,704 --> 00:07:14,106
Chase! You're back!

179
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:20,020
(Roxy) He just showed up
outta nowhere?

180
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:21,455
Yeah, and scared
the crap outta me.

181
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,557
(Laughs) You think he heard
you talking to Boone?

182
00:07:23,592 --> 00:07:24,959
No, definitely not,

183
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:27,061
but it was written
all over my face.

184
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:28,128
What?

185
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:30,164
I don't know.
Um, embarrassment, guilt?

186
00:07:30,198 --> 00:07:32,199
(Laughs) You didn't do
anything wrong.

187
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:35,135
You were talking on the phone.
And Chase is your ex-husband.

188
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,137
I know, I know,
but still, it felt like

189
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,173
he had caught us between
the sheets or something.

190
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:41,942
Really? Is there something
you're not telling me?

191
00:07:41,976 --> 00:07:42,776
<i>No.</i>

192
00:07:42,811 --> 00:07:44,411
(Laughs) Chase
shoulda called first,

193
00:07:44,446 --> 00:07:47,848
- let you know he was back.
- Yeah, but that's not his style.

194
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,850
Did you tell him about
the job offer?

195
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:51,919
Yeah, I managed to squeak
that part out.

196
00:07:51,953 --> 00:07:53,053
And?

197
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:55,055
And I told him I haven't
made any decisions

198
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:57,091
about Atlanta
or anything else.

199
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,059
And, you know,
I know Chase said

200
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:01,010
that he'd quit Delta if I
came back to him, but...

201
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:02,263
But?

202
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:03,697
But Chase loves Delta.

203
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,733
So what if he gives it up,
and six months later,

204
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,835
figures out he made
a big mistake and blames me?

205
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:10,203
Hey, ladies.

206
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:10,835
Hi.

207
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:13,374
Thanks for coming. I know
Joan really appreciates it.

208
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,109
Of course.

209
00:08:16,143 --> 00:08:17,577
Chase is back.

210
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:19,379
Really?
What'd you tell him?

211
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:21,381
Oh, come on.
Not you, too.

212
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:22,916
- Hi, everybody.
- Hey.

213
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,385
Hey, Claudia Joy.
Where's Denise?

214
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,420
She told me you guys
were coming together.

215
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:29,455
Oh, well,
Denise can't make it.

216
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,391
Everything's fine,
but she's at Mercer.

217
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,893
- What?
- What happened?

218
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:37,196
(Sighs) There was a little scare
with Molly last night.

219
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:39,799
(Cell phone rings)

220
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,401
(Ring)

221
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:42,602
Hello.

222
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:44,671
Hey, Tanya.
It's Denise.

223
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:47,540
Oh, hi.

224
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,542
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

225
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,712
No, I'm just packing.

226
00:08:52,746 --> 00:08:55,949
Uh, Tanya, I'm calling
from Mercer hospital.

227
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:58,017
Why? What happened?

228
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,386
Well, you were right
about Molly. She was sick.

229
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,088
She had Pyloric Stenosis.

230
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:04,023
Oh, my God. How is she?

231
00:09:04,058 --> 00:09:07,126
Well, she's perfectly healthy
now, thanks to you.

232
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:08,628
(Inhales)

233
00:09:08,662 --> 00:09:10,129
(Exhales deeply)

234
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:11,631
Well, I-I didn't do anything.

235
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:13,099
Yes, you did.

236
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:16,669
But I wouldn't listen.
I was being stubborn.

237
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,371
(Sighs) I'm sorry.

238
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:21,941
All that matters
is that Molly is okay.

239
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:23,977
Would you come
to the hospital?

240
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:26,279
I'd like you to see her.

241
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,317
Please.

242
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:33,186
(Monitor beeps rhythmically)

243
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:18,765
(Voice amplified) Mrs. holden,

244
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,235
honored guests
and friends,

245
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:25,905
soldiers, and army civilians
of Fort Marshall,

246
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:27,840
it is my privilege

247
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,977
to continue the work
of Colonel Tate.

248
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:35,681
All policies and procedures
will remain in effect.

249
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:37,683
I wouldn't be
standing here today

250
00:10:37,718 --> 00:10:41,220
if not for the outstanding
soldiers I have served with

251
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:44,057
during my proud career
in the United States Army.

252
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:48,428
Without them, none of this
would've been possible.

253
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,865
I particularly would like
to thank my husband,

254
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,500
Dr. Roland Burton.

255
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:57,637
He has sacrificed beyond measure
to help me reach this day.

256
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:00,940
My husband and my daughter
give me the strength

257
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:04,043
and the reason to carry on.

258
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,147
And I can never
thank them enough.

259
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:14,353
(Coos)

260
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,089
Hey.

261
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:17,757
Hey.

262
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:20,126
Thanks for coming.

263
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,695
Of course.

264
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:26,165
Hey there, pumpkin.
Are you feeling better?

265
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,333
Mm-hmm.

266
00:11:27,367 --> 00:11:28,835
For the baby.

267
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:30,570
Oh, you didn't have to.

268
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:32,505
I saw it at the P.X.
And I couldn't resist.

269
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:35,775
Oh, it's adorable.
(Laughs)

270
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:36,909
(Chuckles)

271
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:38,945
Thanks. Here.

272
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:42,115
(Cooing)

273
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:44,517
Hey. (Laughs)

274
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,619
(Baby talk voice)
Let's try this one on, huh?

275
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:48,988
Oh, yeah. She likes it.

276
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:51,924
(Laughs) Good.

277
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,529
(Whispers) Hi. Hi.

278
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:58,097
Tanya...

279
00:11:58,132 --> 00:11:59,565
(Normal voice) It's okay.

280
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,234
No, it's not.

281
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:04,303
You came for a friendly visit,
and I was awful.

282
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:05,972
No, you weren't.

283
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:08,541
Oh, yes, I was.

284
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,309
Okay, a little.

285
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:14,447
(Molly continues cooing)

286
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:16,415
It's just that Jeremy is...

287
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,417
He was my first baby

288
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:20,686
and... whew.

289
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:23,723
I get it. Really.

290
00:12:23,757 --> 00:12:27,059
I wish you and I could
start over somehow.

291
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:29,795
(Sighs) We have.

292
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,365
(Door opens)

293
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,900
(Lowered voice) Surprise.
Hi.

294
00:12:33,934 --> 00:12:35,968
Sorry. I couldn't
keep them away.

295
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:37,436
Aw. Hi.

296
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:38,871
Hi. Mwah.

297
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:41,641
Mwah. Hey, everyone.
This is Tanya Gabriel...

298
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:43,409
Jeremy's fiancée.

299
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:44,911
Hi.
Hey, Tanya.

300
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:49,048
And this is Claudia Joy,
Pamela, Roxy, Roland.

301
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:50,150
Hi.

302
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:51,585
Don't worry.
You'll get used to us.

303
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,921
Yeah, and you don't really
have a choice, so...

304
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:57,157
- How you doin', Denise?
- Great.

305
00:12:57,255 --> 00:12:58,357
Yeah, how was Joan's ceremony?

306
00:12:58,392 --> 00:12:59,859
It was terrific.

307
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:01,794
Oh, my God. I just realized,

308
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:02,620
I won't be able to make it to your
graduation tomorrow.

309
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:04,297
Oh, don't worry.

310
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:07,200
- Oh, yeah, and I have to work.
- Oh, Claudia Joy, me, too.

311
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:09,202
I know you're all busy.
Don't worry.

312
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:11,871
- Well, hell, I'll be there.
- Thanks, Roxy.

313
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:13,873
- Sure.
(Tanya) - You're graduating?

314
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:15,308
Damn straight.
Claudia Joy  Holden

315
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:17,577
- for the defense.
(Laughs) - I'm getting my law degree.

316
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:19,645
Wow. Congratulations.

317
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,547
Well, thank you.
It's a midyear ceremony,

318
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:23,749
so there's not a lot
of pomp and circumstance.

319
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:26,652
Oh, she's being modest.
She's at the top of her class.

320
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:28,154
(Cell phone rings)

321
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:29,655
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.

322
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,123
(Rings and beeps)

323
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:34,860
Hello.
Yes, this is Mrs. LeBlanc.

324
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:40,499
W... that cannot be right.

325
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:42,010
(Man) As I explained
on the phone, ma'am,

326
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,237
your son was caught shoplifting
an mp3 player from the P.X.

327
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:46,010
- this afternoon.
- You sure it was him?

328
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:48,042
Your son was photographed
by video surveillance

329
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:49,744
and the player was found
in his possession.

330
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:54,248
You stole an mp3 player?
(People speaking indistinctly)

331
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:57,750
Thank you, officers,
and you can be sure

332
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:59,553
that he will be properly
punished for this.

333
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:01,322
Well, that's your discretion,
ma'am, but you and your son

334
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:03,324
are to report to the juvenile
discipline review board

335
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,960
- tomorrow at 1300 hours.
- The what?

336
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:07,495
The juvenile
discipline review board.

337
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,430
They handle offenses like this
on Post.

338
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:12,964
And I'm guessing I don't have
a choice in that.

339
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:13,967
No, ma'am.

340
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:17,403
Have a good day.

341
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:18,972
Inside.

342
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,309
(Slams door)

343
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:25,779
What in the world
is going on, T.J.?

344
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:27,247
I don't know.

345
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:29,249
Look at me
when I am talking to you.

346
00:14:29,283 --> 00:14:31,618
Where did you get the idea
that it is okay

347
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:34,087
to take something that
does not belong to you?

348
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:37,320
(Sighs) I am so mad at you
right now,

349
00:14:37,324 --> 00:14:39,492
I don't even know
what to say.

350
00:14:39,527 --> 00:14:40,562
Is this the first time you
stole something?

351
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:42,362
Yes.

352
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:44,864
So if I go into your room
right now,

353
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,933
I am not gonna find
anything else?

354
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:48,268
No.

355
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:50,069
We'll see about that.

356
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:51,938
Mom!

357
00:14:58,245 --> 00:14:59,946
That's my stuff.

358
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,881
And it's in my house.

359
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,984
That's mine.

360
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:09,289
(Sighs)

361
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:12,892
You steal
and now you lie to me?

362
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:14,527
Is this all of it?

363
00:15:14,562 --> 00:15:16,863
Answer me, T.J., right now,
or I swear to God...

364
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:18,765
Yes.

365
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:20,667
(Sighs deeply)

366
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:23,336
- Let's go.
- Where?

367
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,271
Back to the P.X.
You're gonna return this stuff

368
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:27,007
and you're gonna
tell 'em what you did.

369
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,807
Mom!

370
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,742
<i>You</i> move it.

371
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,814
(Roxy) I have never been so
embarrassed in my whole life.

372
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:42,950
Having to tell the
store manager at the P.X.

373
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,119
That my son
took all that stuff...

374
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,587
(Sighs) I swear, Pamela.

375
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:48,956
I just don't know what's
going on with him anymore.

376
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,391
Oh, I'm sorry, Rox.

377
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:53,127
It's like he's turned into
this little monster,

378
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,496
and I just want my sweet,
happy boy back.

379
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,832
I'm starting to get some of that
from Katie and Lucas, too.

380
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:01,235
Yeah, but they're not
shoplifting from the P.X.

381
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:04,238
And you know what's weird?
Most of the stuff he took,

382
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:06,240
he hadn't even
unwrapped it yet.

383
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:08,175
- Figure that out.
- Feeling guilty, maybe?

384
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,744
- So why keep stealing?
- I don't know.

385
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,746
Kids do crazy things.

386
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:14,215
Oh, shoot.

387
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:15,449
What?

388
00:16:15,484 --> 00:16:16,884
(Sighs) Now I can't go

389
00:16:16,918 --> 00:16:18,953
to Claudia Joy's graduation
tomorrow.

390
00:16:18,987 --> 00:16:20,521
I have to go

391
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:22,957
to this discipline review
punishment thing with T.J.

392
00:16:22,991 --> 00:16:24,558
Well, I'm sure
she'll understand.

393
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:27,628
- Well, what am I supposed to tell her?
- The truth.

394
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:29,530
Uh, no. I'm not telling
Claudia Joy Holden

395
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:31,198
that my son is a thief.

396
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:32,900
- Roxy!
- I'll just tell her

397
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,603
that there's a field trip for
one of the boys or something.

398
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:36,072
Hey, mom.

399
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:38,072
Um, hey, Roxy.
Chase is here with the kids.

400
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:40,474
So you hang in there, and I'll call
you back later, okay?

401
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:41,990
Okay. Thanks.

402
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,978
- Dad took us to the pier.
- Okay, bye.

403
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:45,913
Fish and chips.
We brought you some.

404
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:48,048
- But Lucas ate all your chips.
- I did not.

405
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,917
Well, that's okay.
I don't need any chips

406
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:53,554
- if I want to keep fitting in my uniform.
- Oh, you fit into it just fine.

407
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,089
(Katie) Can we watch TV?

408
00:16:55,123 --> 00:16:56,557
Uh, homework first.

409
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:58,092
(Lucas) But...

410
00:16:58,126 --> 00:16:59,894
No buts. Go.

411
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:01,562
(Katie) Fine.

412
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:11,107
So...

413
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:13,807
Chase, if you want an
answer, I don't have one yet.

414
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:14,277
Pamela...

415
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,977
and I know it's annoying,
but I've got a lot to think about.

416
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,613
Pamela, I have something to say.

417
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:22,416
Okay. Sorry.

418
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,986
I dropped my papers today.

419
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,022
It'll take a month or so
to process,

420
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:31,258
but after that, I won't be
a Delta operator anymore.

421
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:35,228
I know I told you I was gonna
wait for your answer,

422
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:39,132
but while I was away this time,
I got to thinking.

423
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:43,102
I want to be near the kids,
no matter what.

424
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:47,174
So I requested
a reassignment to instructor.

425
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:48,842
Wow.

426
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,277
No more missions.

427
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:52,312
No more leaving
in the middle of the night.

428
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:54,681
No more worrying
about where I am.

429
00:17:54,716 --> 00:17:56,516
Wow.

430
00:17:56,551 --> 00:17:59,286
You said that already.

431
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,389
Are you sure about this?

432
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:05,459
Yeah, I'm positive.

433
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:14,568
Okay, time to turn off
reading lights.

434
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:17,971
Night, mom.

435
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:20,307
Night, Finn.

436
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:27,514
Night, T.J.

437
00:18:32,286 --> 00:18:34,654
(Roxy blows air)

438
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,991
(Cell phone rings)

439
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:39,760
(Ring)

440
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,228
(Beeps)

441
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:42,796
Hey, babe.

442
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,665
Oh, am I glad
to talk to you.

443
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,701
What the hell
is going on there, Rox?

444
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:49,836
What?
I come back from patrol,

445
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:52,305
and my platoon sergeant
pulls me out of chow line

446
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,574
and tells me T.J.'s stealing
from the P.X.

447
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:55,976
Yeah. Um...

448
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,079
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

449
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:00,981
What the hell is going on?

450
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,283
Hey, do not yell at me,
Trevor.

451
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:06,052
- Well, my son's stealing?
- It's <i>our</i> son,

452
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:08,555
and I don't know what's
going on with him either,

453
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:11,691
other than the fact that
his father is 8,000 miles away.

454
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:13,627
Oh, so this is my fault?

455
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:15,896
I suppose this has nothing
to do with the fact

456
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,798
that you had some guy sleep
over the other night?

457
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,298
What??

458
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:20,300
I heard about it
from three other guys, Roxy.

459
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:22,602
Their wives told 'em
his truck was still parked

460
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:24,571
out in front of our house
the next morning

461
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:26,640
and that you
kissed him good-bye.

462
00:19:26,674 --> 00:19:28,241
I did not kiss him.

463
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:30,644
It... it's an old friend.
Nothing happened.

464
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:32,445
What old friend?

465
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,917
(Sighs) Finn's dad. Whit.

466
00:19:36,951 --> 00:19:39,653
Finn's dad? I thought you said
he was out of your life.

467
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:42,255
He was. He <i>is.</i>
He was just passing through.

468
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,191
His daddy died
and left him some money,

469
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,520
and he wanted to
give Finn some of it.

470
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,694
Well, you didn't
take it did you?

471
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,663
It's for Finn's college fund.

472
00:19:49,697 --> 00:19:52,799
Damn it, Roxy.
We don't need anybody's money.

473
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,434
I can provide for our family.

474
00:19:54,468 --> 00:19:56,469
I know you can, babe.

475
00:19:56,504 --> 00:19:58,538
So... so you took his money

476
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,473
then you had beers with him
on our front porch

477
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:01,210
with the whole
neighborhood watching.

478
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,210
I had two beers.

479
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,145
And he had a couple more,

480
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:07,180
so I let him sleep it off
on the couch.

481
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:09,082
You're unbelievable.
You let an ex-boyfriend

482
00:20:09,116 --> 00:20:11,051
sleep in our house
while I'm not there?

483
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,019
<i>On the couch.</i>

484
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:15,856
And he's not an ex-boyfriend.
I already told you that.

485
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,858
No, he's just the father
of your son.

486
00:20:17,892 --> 00:20:19,427
And you really wonder why
T.J.'s stealing from the P.X.?

487
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:20,928
That is so unfair.

488
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:23,830
It has absolutely
nothing to do with that.

489
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:25,164
How could you... I can't even
believe you could say that!

490
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:27,334
What do you want me to say?

491
00:20:27,368 --> 00:20:30,337
I come back from patrol after
busting my ass for five days

492
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:33,940
to find out my wife is kissing
some other dude on our porch.

493
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:36,977
I told you that
that is not what happened.

494
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:39,045
Look, Trevor, I think

495
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,115
we need to concentrate on what
is really important here. Okay?

496
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:44,317
You need to talk to T.J.,

497
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:46,486
because he will listen to you,

498
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,689
and I can't play bad cop
all the time.

499
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:50,822
Fine. I'll try you tomorrow.
I gotta go.

500
00:20:50,826 --> 00:20:53,293
Fine.

501
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,463
Ugh!

502
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,835
(Men speak indistinctly)

503
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,837
Ma'am,
governor Haley's office called

504
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,172
to confirm her attendance
at tonight's reception.

505
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:06,142
Excellent.

506
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,475
Yes, ma'am.
It'll be a good opportunity

507
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:08,877
to bring up your
green initiative for the Post.

508
00:21:09,312 --> 00:21:11,345
Good idea, sergeant major.

509
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,181
I see we have the Juvenile
Discipline Review Board today.

510
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:16,683
Yes, ma'am. Last Tuesday
of every month.

511
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:20,387
Four cases today... Wilson,
cross, Tobias, and LeBlanc.

512
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:21,290
LeBlanc?

513
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,390
Toby Jack LeBlanc, ma'am.
You familiar with the family?

514
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:24,892
Yes, I am.

515
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:26,894
Is that gonna be a problem?

516
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:28,962
Not at all, sergeant major.

517
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,931
What else do we have today?

518
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:32,366
Let's see.

519
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,401
We have a meeting with
Colonel Reddick at 1100 hours.

520
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:37,104
The Provost Marshal
wants to present upgrade

521
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:38,939
for the perimeter
at 1600 hours.

522
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,674
However, I suggest
we move that...

523
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,844
(Indistinct conversations)

524
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,374
Excuse me.

525
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:15,809
Thank you. All right.

526
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:17,578
Claudia Joy.

527
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:20,447
Congratulations.

528
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:22,583
Thank you,
Professor Chandler.

529
00:22:22,617 --> 00:22:25,419
You know, my class won't be
the same without you.

530
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:28,388
Oh, I bet you say that
to all your students.

531
00:22:29,423 --> 00:22:32,292
No. Uh, I don't.

532
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:36,363
Uh... you alone?

533
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,398
Yes, Michael's, um,
in Afghanistan

534
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:40,334
and my friends were tied up.

535
00:22:40,368 --> 00:22:42,503
Well, you can't be alone
on your graduation day.

536
00:22:42,537 --> 00:22:44,238
(Chuckles)

537
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:45,772
How about lunch?

538
00:22:46,807 --> 00:22:48,542
Oh, come on. You worked hard
to get to this day.

539
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,478
You d... you deserve
a little celebration.

540
00:22:52,513 --> 00:22:52,946
You're right.

541
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:54,314
Excellent.

542
00:22:54,349 --> 00:22:55,849
So...

543
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:57,818
What are you in the mood for?

544
00:22:57,852 --> 00:23:00,988
(Both speaking indistinctly)

545
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:05,292
So, uh, I take it

546
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:07,561
you are studying
for the bar?

547
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,029
I am.

548
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:10,998
South Carolina
and New York.

549
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:12,466
New York?

550
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,101
Mm-hmm.
Michael's being considered

551
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:17,271
- for a position at West Point.
- Oh, impressive.

552
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:19,039
Also confidential.

553
00:23:19,073 --> 00:23:20,507
Understood.

554
00:23:20,542 --> 00:23:22,276
So... (Slurps)

555
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,479
What about when
you're done with the bar?

556
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:27,047
I don't know.

557
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:30,350
Have you considered
applying for a clerkship?

558
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:33,280
Working for a judge would
make you very marketable.

559
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:33,887
Oh, I would love to.

560
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,356
But any judge would
expect me to work full-time,

561
00:23:36,391 --> 00:23:38,325
and that's just, uh,
it's not realistic

562
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,827
with my duties
at Fort Marshall.

563
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:43,130
I see.

564
00:23:43,164 --> 00:23:46,366
And most law firms don't offer
part-time work, so...

565
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,069
Most.

566
00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:51,305
But...

567
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,140
Not all.

568
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:59,046
Would you consider
working for me?

569
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:11,841
(Joan) Now that we've reviewed
the charges against you, T.J.,

570
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:14,878
is there anything
you'd like to say?

571
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,346
I'm really sorry.

572
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,216
I mean, I know stealing's wrong
and I won't do it again.

573
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,620
And he means that, too. T.J.
Is not a problem, and I...

574
00:24:23,654 --> 00:24:25,121
Mrs. LeBlanc,
please sit down.

575
00:24:25,156 --> 00:24:27,757
You're not permitted to speak
at this proceeding.

576
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:30,693
Sorry. He really is
a good boy.

577
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,675
T.J., the board appreciates
your apology

578
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,811
and hopes that your remorse
is sincere.

579
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,715
Nevertheless, criminal behavior
cannot go unpunished.

580
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,418
You are barred from the P.X.
for six months.

581
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,453
You will be issued
a new I.D. Card

582
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,888
with restrictions.

583
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:52,082
You will also write
a 500-word essay

584
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,017
on the dangers of shoplifting

585
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:56,719
to be delivered to this board
in one week.

586
00:24:56,754 --> 00:24:58,621
Do you understand?

587
00:24:58,656 --> 00:25:00,090
Yes, ma'am.

588
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,592
Additionally, to recover costs
related to shoplifting,

589
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,694
per Post Exchange regulation,

590
00:25:04,728 --> 00:25:08,765
I am imposing a $100 fee
per shoplifted item...

591
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,367
an mp3 player, two DVDs,

592
00:25:11,402 --> 00:25:13,369
a package of markers,
and a model car.

593
00:25:13,404 --> 00:25:16,673
Wait a minute.
That's $500.

594
00:25:16,707 --> 00:25:18,000
Please, Mrs. LeBlanc,
sit down.

595
00:25:18,026 --> 00:25:19,927
But he returned
all that stuff,

596
00:25:19,961 --> 00:25:22,029
and he also apologized
to the store manager.

597
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,598
We recognize the burden
these fines may place on you,

598
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:26,667
but they are mandated
by policy.

599
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:29,536
Well, you wouldn't have even
known about those other items

600
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:31,505
if I didn't make T.J.
Bring them back.

601
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:34,041
Mrs. LeBlanc, your presence
here is a privilege.

602
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:36,076
Just as it is a privilege
for your family

603
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:37,845
to have housing on Post.

604
00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:41,348
In the future, I recommend
you control your son's behavior.

605
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:45,352
Thank you for your time.

606
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:49,690
Let's go.

607
00:25:55,363 --> 00:25:56,964
(Door closes)

608
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,316
(Roxy) It was so unfair.

609
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,917
Okay, all right,
slow down.

610
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:03,387
She fined me $500...

611
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:05,022
- Right.
- And humiliated me.

612
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:07,924
Look, Joan was just doing
her job. It's not personal.

613
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:10,394
Not personal? She threatened
to throw us off Post.

614
00:26:10,428 --> 00:26:12,496
I'm sure
she didn't mean that.

615
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,531
You weren't there.

616
00:26:14,565 --> 00:26:16,633
No, I wasn't.

617
00:26:16,668 --> 00:26:20,203
- So what do you want me to do?
- I don't know. Talk to her.

618
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:21,797
We returned <i>everything,</i>

619
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:24,499
so why should we have to pay
a fine on top of that?

620
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:26,101
Look, Roxy, I'm sorry,

621
00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:29,638
but I'm not gonna tell my wife
how to do her job. (Sighs)

622
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:32,908
If you want, I could...
I could talk to T.J. For you.

623
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:35,143
No, thank you.
I can handle my son.

624
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,577
Well, I thought you just told
me you were having problems.

625
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,346
I'll handle it.

626
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,617
(Sighs)

627
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:45,252
(Sighs)

628
00:26:45,287 --> 00:26:47,354
Hey, look...

629
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:49,323
I know this is rough.

630
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:53,027
But Joan's job is to enforce
Post regulations.

631
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:55,062
I'm sure
it was hard on her, too.

632
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:57,450
(Scoffs) Not as hard
as it was on me.

633
00:26:57,466 --> 00:26:58,390
No.

634
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:03,404
But the real problem here
is T.J., isn't it?

635
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:05,673
I guess.

636
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:07,374
Trevor been any help?

637
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:09,143
(Scoffs)

638
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:11,312
(Sighs)

They cleared Molly
to go home today.

Good. (Laughs)

646

Tanya's gonna stay
a few extra days

647
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:37,639
and help out.

648
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,140
Great. I'm so glad.

649

How was graduation?

It was fine.

652

Professor Chandler
was there.

Mm-hmm.
Took me to lunch.

Oh, did you hear
from Michael?

659
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,694
No.

660
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:02,329
Hmm.

661
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:04,265
I'm sure he's busy.

662
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,533

666
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:13,941
some flowers
would've been nice...

667
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:16,010

Your garbage disposal

677
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,570
And I fixed that leak
in your guest bathroom.

678
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:45,606
Good.
You're a lifesaver.

00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:50,636
those came for you
while I was here.

682
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:52,038
Pretty.

683
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:54,373
Yeah.

Besides... (Clears throat)
I have some good news, too.

713
00:30:08,582 --> 00:30:10,583
I got a job offer today.

<i>What? You haven't even
taken the Bar.</i>

I can work around
my responsibilities on Post.

<i>Right.</i>

Michael,
it's a great opportunity.

00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:34,807
Associate-level work...
there's no way

724
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:36,742
I'd get an offer like this
anywhere else.

725

<i>Well, you know I'm not wild

is not exactly my idea
of a good time.

802
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:13,092
Get used to it.
(Mouths word)

803
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:15,261
Come on.

804
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:17,997
Joan will start wondering
why you're avoiding her.

805
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:20,533
Well, she's with the Governor.
Exactly, and that's why

806
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:23,302
- you need to be right at her side.
- Claudia Joy...

807
00:34:23,337 --> 00:34:26,005
come on, soldier.

808
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,740
(Music continues)

809
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,108
Colonel, sergeant major.

810
00:34:29,142 --> 00:34:31,477
(Joan) Evening, Claudia Joy.

811
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:33,546
Governor Haley, it's so good
to see you again.

812
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,548
It's my pleasure.

813
00:34:35,582 --> 00:34:37,617
Governor, this is my husband,
Dr. Roland Burton.

814
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:39,852
Evening, ma'am.
Uh, Governor.

815
00:34:39,886 --> 00:34:41,921
- Nice to meet you, Dr. Burton.
- Same here.

816
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,856
I was just telling Roland
how much we appreciate

817
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:46,525
- your support of military families.
- Thank you.

818
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,960
Thank you.

819
00:34:47,995 --> 00:34:49,263
I know Joan's
really looking forward

820
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,490
to working with you on some
environmental initiatives.

821
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:53,432
Really? I'd love to
hear about that.

822
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,900
I was just getting there,

823
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:57,336
but my husband
is one step ahead of me.

824
00:34:57,371 --> 00:35:00,673
Well, it happens occasionally, but
very occasionally. (All laugh)

825
00:35:00,707 --> 00:35:03,276
(Joan) All right.
Well, I'd love to talk about it.

826
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,811
Devlin, you will set that up?
(Devlin) I'll check the schedule.

827
00:35:07,546 --> 00:35:09,181
(T.J.) Hey, dad.

828
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:11,816
(Trevor) What's going on
with you?

829
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:13,551
I messed up.

830
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:14,186
Yeah.

831
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,154
You messed up big-time.

832
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,823
Yeah,
I told everyone I'm sorry.

833
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,260
Okay. So what are you
gonna tell me?

834
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:24,763
Do I have to remind you that
your actions have consequences?

835
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:25,295
No.

836
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:27,266
And not just consequences for you,

837
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,868
but for your mom, me, Finn,

838
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:31,069
everyone.

839
00:35:31,104 --> 00:35:32,504
I know.

840
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:36,408
I gotta say, T.J., I'm real
disappointed in you.

841
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:37,843
I expected a lot more.

842
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:40,479
I need you to stay
on the right path from now on.

843
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,681
- You understand?
- Yes.

844
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:44,216
Yes, what?

845
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,118
Yes, sir.

846
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:49,054
Okay.
Put your mom back on.

847
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:51,123
Okay. Bye, dad.

848
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:53,192
He wants
to talk to you again.

849
00:35:53,226 --> 00:35:56,028
Okay. Go get ready
for bed.

850
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,267
So? So I hope I got through to him.

851
00:36:02,302 --> 00:36:04,436
Yeah, me, too.

852
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,873
(Sighs) I can't take
much more of this, Trevor.

853
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:09,842
I don't know
what's going on there, Rox,

854
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,177
but whatever it is,
it's gotta stop.

855
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,278
Now.

856
00:36:13,313 --> 00:36:16,215
Really, Trevor, does it?
Does it need to stop?

857
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:19,017
Thank you so much
for your support.

858
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,719
Well,
you're the one at home,

859
00:36:20,753 --> 00:36:23,822
so you're the one who's gotta
keep it together.

860
00:36:23,857 --> 00:36:25,257
(Sighs) Yeah.

861
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,627
Well, do you want to tell me
how to do that?

862
00:36:32,632 --> 00:36:34,833
(Sighs)

863
00:36:35,868 --> 00:36:37,970
(Chuckles)
I thought that went well.

864
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:39,838
(Chuckles) Yeah.

865
00:36:39,873 --> 00:36:41,907
It's gonna take
a little getting used to,

866
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:44,309
being a commander's spouse.

867
00:36:44,344 --> 00:36:47,112
(Laughs)
You did great.

868
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:49,414
Thank you.

869
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,753
Hey, Roxy came by
to see me today.

870
00:36:56,155 --> 00:36:57,522
Oh?

871
00:36:57,557 --> 00:37:00,259
Yeah, she was pretty upset.

872
00:37:00,293 --> 00:37:02,194
Her son stole from the P.X.

873
00:37:02,228 --> 00:37:04,263
And had to face
the consequences.

874
00:37:04,297 --> 00:37:05,364
Mm-hmm.

875
00:37:05,398 --> 00:37:07,432
I sure hope
he learned his lesson.

876
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:09,701
Me, too.

877
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:12,237
But 500 bucks?
Sounds kinda harsh.

878
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:16,074
I agree,
but it's Post policy.

879
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,777
Roxy shouldn't have
come to you with this.

880
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:21,613
Ah, don't worry.
I defended you.

881
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:23,515
I don't need defending.

882
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:26,118
Her son is the one
who did something wrong.

883
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:27,786
Okay. I understand.

884
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,322
(Sighs)

885
00:37:30,356 --> 00:37:32,124
I hope so.

886
00:37:34,661 --> 00:37:37,429
As Garrison commander,

887
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:41,333
I've got a lot of people
watching my every move.

888
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:45,304
As a woman, particularly
as a woman of color,

889
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:48,407
I've got to be
better than good at this job.

890
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:51,910
I have
got to be outstanding.

891
00:37:52,945 --> 00:37:54,947
One hint of favoritism,

892
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,748
one sign of weakness,

893
00:37:56,783 --> 00:37:59,785
my credibility is gone.

894
00:38:02,188 --> 00:38:04,823
I got it.

895
00:38:04,857 --> 00:38:07,259
