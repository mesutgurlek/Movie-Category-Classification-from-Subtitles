01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,970
But you had 600 hundred
men to worry about,

1132
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,690
and I had 20,000 sent into action.

1133
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,081
I have to live with that.

1134
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,849
I sent for trucks to
bring your men back.

1135
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,331
They've been through hell.

1136
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,482
You'll never know what they've been through,
or what they can or they can't do.

1137
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,284
They're better than you, General.

1138
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,810
They're better than me.
They always are.

1139
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:40,607
Let me take you and your
officers back in my staff car.

1140
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:45,531
That's not acceptable, Sir.
I'll stay with my men.

1141
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,450
I understand.

1142
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:09,763
Men

1143
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,680
We're moving out!

1144
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,210
