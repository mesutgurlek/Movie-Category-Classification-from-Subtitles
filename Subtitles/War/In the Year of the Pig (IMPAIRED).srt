<i>has been the suppression</i>
<i>of political activity...</i>

<i>to force the people</i>

<i>years</i>— <i>out ofhis country...</i>

<i>for village life in Vietnam...</i>

<i>is the essential</i>
<i>of the life of the nation.</i>

48
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:51,700
<i>I wouldjust give you one anecdote</i>
<i>to show you that connection.</i>

49
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:56,071
<i>When he, for the first time,</i>
<i>met a press</i>—

50
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,051
<i>gave a press conference in Hanoi...</i>

51
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:02,555
<i>in 1945...</i>

52
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,548
<i>where he came for the first time</i>
<i>as a leader ofhis nation...</i>

53
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:10,730
<i>in front of the public...</i>

54
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,466
<i>he said to the people there...</i>

55
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,602
<i>"I can't tell you</i>
<i>what you have to do...</i>

56
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,739
but I can show it to you."

57
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,841
Put his thumb on the table...

58
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,609
and said...

59
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,580
"If everywhere
where you put your thumb...

60
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,982
"on the sacred earth of Vietnam...

61
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,986
"there is a plant growing,

Now, this is, again,
one of the points where Ho...

64
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:43,129
on one hand, is a Marxist economist...

65
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:47,033
who knows the importance
of the basic production...

66
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,903
and, on the other hand,
a Confucian scholar...

67
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:54,896
because what you have to have in mind
to understand that idea...

68
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,076
of the thumb on the earth...

69
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,913
is a simple Chinese proverb.

70
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,082
"A thumb square...

100
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,741
<i>He left Vietnam, went on a boat...</i>

101
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,344
<i>landed at New York, at London...</i>

102
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,247
<i>at Le Havre and, after that, in Paris...</i>

<i>after that, a communist.</i>

105
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,122

00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,933
<i>"to tell you...</i>

159
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,926
<i>that we want Vietnam</i>
<i>tojoin us in the French union. "</i>

160
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,241
<i>Looked at me and he said,</i>
<i>"The French union?</i>

161
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,409
<i>"What's that?</i>

162
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,112
<i>Is it a circle, or is it a square?"</i>

163
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,414
<i>That was a test...</i>

164
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,550
<i>because there is a Chinese proverb</i>—

165
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,786
<i>a lot of Chinese proverbs</i>—

166
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,779
<i>which identify heaven</i>
<i>and intelligence...</i>

167
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,959
<i>with the circle...</i>

168
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,796
<i>and earth and solidity</i>
<i>with the square.</i>

169
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,789
<i>Is it an idea, or is it a fact?</i>
<i>Is it somewhere?</i>

170
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:24,859
<i>So I answered, and I think</i>
<i>it's one of the occasions...</i>

171
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,573
where Ho Chi Minh has been
just a little surprised.

172
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,243
I answered, "I don't know."
He said, "But what are you doing here?"

173
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,236
I said, "I came to ask you
because we have to build it together."

174
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,808
Towards the end
of November
of 1946...

175
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,555
when the admiral
commanding
the French fleet...

176
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,124
in the Bay ofTonkin...

177
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:49,117
in his words, decided to teach
the Vietnamese government a hard lesson...

178
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,032
the fleet stood off of Haiphong
and shelled the city...

179
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:57,025
until between 6,000 and 10,000
were killed.

180
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:01,429
He said, "I have no army."
That's not true now.

181
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,011
"I have no army." 1945.

182
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,447
"I have no finance.

183
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,916
"I have no diplomacy.

184
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,920
"I have no public instruction.

185
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,656
"I have just hatred...

186
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,359
"and I will not disarm it...

187
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,352
until you give me confidence in you."

188
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:28,167
Now, this is the thing
on which I would insist...

189
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:31,437
because it's still alive in his memory,
as in mine.

190
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:35,341
For every time Ho Chi Minh
has trusted us...

191
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,409
we betrayed him.

192
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,912
Here you had a country...

193
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,513
which was not just divided...

194
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,415
at the 17 th parallel.

195
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:46,085
You had fought the Indochina war...

196
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,989
<i>and all the best and most talented</i>
<i>Vietnamese of a generation...</i>

197
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,492
<i>had faced, in 1946 and 1947...</i>

198
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:56,495
<i>the alternative of the French...</i>

199
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,898
<i>or the Viet Minh.</i>

200
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,900
<i>The best of a generation</i>—

201
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,570
<i>the kind of young men who wouldjoin up</i>
<i>the day after Pearl Harbor in this country.</i>

202
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,563
<i>Are you going to fight to kick out the French,</i>
<i>or are you going to be a French puppet?</i>

203
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,578
<i>So the most talented people</i>
<i>of a generation all signed up...</i>

204
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,114
<i>and the Viet Minh won this war...</i>

205
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,116
<i>and it was an enormously popular</i>
<i>national war.</i>

206
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,719
<i>At the end of it, they came up with</i>
<i>a dynamic society which had won a war...</i>

207
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,322
<i>which was tested, which was tough...</i>

208
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:27,315
<i>which had brought up to the top</i>
<i>the very best of a generation.</i>

209
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,063
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>There are some similarities...</i>

210
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,632
<i>between the French...</i>

211
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,336
<i>effort in the Indochina war</i>
<i>in Vietnam...</i>

212
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,138
<i>and the Americans.</i>

213
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,474
<i>The Americans arejust so much</i>
<i>more powerful than the French were.</i>

214
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,643
<i>They have so much more artillery.</i>

215
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:48,180
<i>They have so much more air power.</i>
<i>They have so many more men.</i>

216
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,649
<i>They have so much more wealth</i>
<i>than the French ever had.</i>

217
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,642
<i>So that they're not going to be</i>
<i>any Dien Bien Phus...</i>

218
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:59,258
<i>in the American presence there.</i>

219
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,126
<i>[Announcer] In Washington,</i>
<i>the U.S. Secretary of Defense</i>—

220
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,129
<i>[Wilson] The equipment</i>
<i>which we have sent to Indochina...</i>

221
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,265
<i>is highly technical...</i>

222
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,634
<i>so we are sending technicians...</i>

223
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,203
<i>as a temporary training force.</i>

224
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,973
<i>We are sending planes, but no pilots.</i>

225
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,966
<i>We are not sending combat troops.</i>

226
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,716
We have seen no reason
for the abandonment...

227
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,785
of the so-called Navarre Plan.

228
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,356
<i>That plan, as you may recall,</i>
<i>broadly speaking...</i>

229
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,157
<i>was a two-year plan...</i>

230
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:36,150
<i>and contemplated a very substantial</i>
<i>buildup oflocal forces...</i>

231
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,664
<i>and their training and equipment.</i>

232
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,301
<i>[Halberstam] The French moved in</i>
<i>to Dien Bien Phu in 1953</i>—

233
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,670
<i>in January of 1953.</i>

234
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,439
<i>Parachute battalion</i>
<i>came into the area.</i>

235
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,775
<i>The idea was</i>—
<i>There were two aspects of it.</i>

236
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,579
<i>One, to control the piece of ground</i>
<i>and then to prevent the Viet Minh...</i>

237
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,815
<i>from sweeping on into Laos.</i>

238
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,386
<i>I do not expect that there is</i>
<i>going to be a communist victory...</i>

239
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:04,323
<i>in Indochina.</i>

240
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:08,316
<i>By that, I don't mean that</i>
<i>there may not be local affairs...</i>

241
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,398
<i>where one side or the other</i>
<i>will win victories.</i>

242
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,300
<i>But in terms of a communist</i>
<i>domination of Indochina...</i>

243
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,337
<i>that I do not accept</i>
<i>as a probability.</i>

244
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,206
<i>[Halberstam]</i>
<i>The French generals did not believe...</i>

245
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,576
<i>that artillery could be brought to bear</i>
<i>in sufficient quantity...</i>

246
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,779
<i>so, correspondingly,</i>
<i>they were not active...</i>

247
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,848
<i>in their patrolling outside</i>
<i>of their particular perimeter.</i>

248
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,484
<i>The feature was</i>
<i>to keep the focus on the area...</i>

249
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:36,455
<i>not to cause the quick rush</i>
<i>of the battle position...</i>

250
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,792
<i>but to build</i>
<i>the particular battle position.</i>

251
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,827
The French miscalculated —

252
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,662
as, I think, did we —

253
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,655
<i>in the degree of sophistication</i>
<i>of the weaponry...</i>

254
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:51,503
<i>that was deployed on the high ground.</i>

255
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,139
<i>We didn't think they could get</i>
<i>these pieces up there...</i>

256
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,508
<i>but they did somehow.</i>

257
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,877
The Battle of Dien Bien Phu...

258
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:02,870
is a significant phenomenon
in military history...

259
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:07,442
<i>and from all of the standpoints</i>
<i>that one views a war.</i>

260
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,524
<i>It achieved a particular</i>
<i>political objective...</i>

261
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,395
<i>in the full Clausewitzian sense</i>
<i>of the term.</i>

262
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,299
<i>It represented</i>
<i>a tremendous logistical effort...</i>

263
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,168
<i>on the part of the North Vietnamese...</i>

264
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,170
<i>or of General Giap...</i>

265
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,873
<i>to move the artillery pieces...</i>

266
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,810
<i>which changed the balance</i>
<i>of this particular battle significantly.</i>

267
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,714
Forces of aggression seem to be
concentrating just at one point...

268
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,850
at Dien Bien Phu...

269
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,619
<i>where the resistance</i>
<i>is extremely gallant...</i>

270
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,522
<i>against overwhelming odds.</i>

271
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,225
<i>[Lacouture] The French</i>
<i>had begun the war as a colonial war.</i>

272
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:50,218
<i>They try many times to change</i>
<i>this very nature of the war</i>—

273
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,355
<i>trying to change it in a civil war...</i>

274
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:58,337
<i>a war between the right and the left</i>
<i>in Vietnam...</i>

275
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,507
<i>and, after that,</i>
<i>an international war...</i>

276
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,500
<i>a crusade against communism.</i>

277
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,670
<i>[Morton] It was clear that the French</i>
<i>were in deep trouble in Dien Bien Phu.</i>

278
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,719
<i>And then Admiral Radford thought</i>
<i>that if we went in with air...</i>

279
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,721
<i>we could knock 'em out.</i>

280
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:19,358
<i>[Man] Senator Morton,</i>
<i>as you know from my letter to you...</i>

281
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,760
<i>we are very interested</i>
<i>in a meeting</i>—

282
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,753
<i>It was called by Mr. Secretary Dulles</i>
<i>and Admiral Radford...</i>

283
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,267
<i>in which you played a part...</i>

284
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,336
<i>and in which eight members of the congress</i>
<i>of the United States were present</i>—

285
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,539
<i>five senators and two representatives.</i>

286
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,276
<i>I wonder if you could give us your best</i>
<i>recollection of who was at that meeting</i>—

287
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:41,269
Senator Morton, sound one, take one.

288
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:45,551
There was a meeting —
I've forgotten the exact date.

289
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,353
This can be easily ascertained.

290
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,346
I assume that the records
have been kept.

291
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,227
The burden of it was...

292
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,529
Admiral Radford's feeling...

293
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,522
that we should really move in...

294
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,560
and bring active support
to the French.

295
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:09,730
Specifically, air support
from carrier base —

296
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,844
from carriers.

297
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:16,448
Carriers were available
in the nearby area.

298
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,718
How many missions could have been mounted?
I don't know.

299
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,721
I didn't get into the military details.

300
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,024
And it was felt that the artillery...

301
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,927
that they had on the high ground...

302
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,798
could be destroyed by air attack.

303
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,791
They fail always because they were
always seen by the Vietnamese...

304
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:39,438
as a foreign power...

305
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,841
trying to get back

452
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,403
that the interest of the Vietnam...

453
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:08,606
are identical with the interest...

454
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,376
of the people of the free world.

455
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,444
It is on this plan —

456
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:17,437
<i>[Applause]</i>

457
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,854
It is on this plan...

458
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,523
that your and our fight...

459
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:28,426
is one and the same.

460
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:32,419
We do —
We'll continue to fight communism.

461
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:35,233
<i>[Applause]</i>

462
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,536
It is not— It may be repeated here —

463
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,405
There is no two Vietnams.

464
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,340
There is only one Vietnam...

465
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,909
temporarily divided
in Geneva in '54...

466
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,545
between a free zone,
which is North Vietnam...

467
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:50,648
and an occupied zone,
occupied by the French —

468
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:54,641
but the French had still, after Geneva,
the jurisdiction over South Vietnam...

469
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,957
because they could not hand it over
to a regime which did not exist.

470
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,860
It is not even mentioned
in the Geneva agreement.

471
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,330
The regime of Saigon
is only a temporary one...

472
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,899
in waiting for election.

473
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,002
The refusal was amply justified...

474
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:14,138
if only because the kind of election...

475
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:18,131
envisaged by the Geneva agreement
of 1954 —

476
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:20,345
a free election —

477
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,513
could not have been held.

478
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,884
Anyone who thinks
that a free election...

479
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,487
was possible
in communist North Vietnam...

480
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,957
knows little
of how communists operate...

481
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,950
and could have fallen into
a Moscow-Peiping trap.

482
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,131
The United States could not agree today...

483
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:43,067
any more than in 1956...

484
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,504
to legitimizing communist control...

485
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:50,497
of all Vietnam by a device
of a communist-style election.

486
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,478
You all have sat with me...

487
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:57,482
on the Foreign Relations Committee in 1956...

488
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:01,475
when our intelligence forces
brought in their reports warning...

489
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,489
that if the election called for
by the Geneva accords...

490
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,992
forJuly 1956 were held...

491
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,095
Ho Chi Minh would be elected
president in South Vietnam...

492
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,698
by at least 80% of the vote.

493
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:17,691
And our country that boasts about
believing in self-determination...

494
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,429
used its power and its prestige
and its influence...

495
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:26,466
really to get our first
puppet government under Diem...

496
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,213
not to cooperate
in holding those elections.

497
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,549
That's just a matter
of historic record.

498
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,619
As you know,
when Ngo Dinh Diem and Nhu...

499
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,523
were finally killed in 1963...

500
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:41,159
some 50,000 to 60,000 —

501
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,962
the precise number
is not readily available —

502
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,955
but some 50,000 to 60,000
political prisoners...

503
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:52,192
were released from prisons
in South Vietnam subsequent to this.

504
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,674
Uh, elements
of the rotating governments...

505
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,411
<i>that followed the death</i>
<i>of Diem and Nhu...</i>

506
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,548
<i>have indicated</i>
<i>that most of those people...</i>

507
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:07,185
<i>were not Vietcong sympathizers</i>
<i>in any way, shape or form...</i>

508
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:11,089
<i>which would indicate</i>
<i>that all political...</i>

509
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,559
<i>activity that was antithetical</i>
<i>to Diem and Nhu...</i>

510
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,552
<i>was met either with murder</i>
<i>in the south or imprisonment.</i>

511
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,666
And from 1958...

512
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,169
we see the existence,
confirmed by some American experts...

513
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,438
and some broadcasts from —

514
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:31,042
of a National Front for Liberation
of South Vietnam.

515
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:34,145
<i>It was, in fact, a consolidation</i>
<i>of all the forces...</i>

516
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:38,138
<i>who, for years, were struggling</i>
<i>against the Diem regime...</i>

517
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:42,309
<i>and it was not, as it has been said</i>
<i>too much and too often...</i>

518
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,523
<i>the political arm of Hanoi.</i>

519
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,516
<i>The National Front for Liberation</i>
<i>included the former remnants...</i>

520
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,263
<i>of this political religious sects,</i>
<i>Cao Dai and Hao...</i>

521
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:55,600
<i>Binh Xuyen too, the former Viet Minh...</i>

522
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,703
<i>and the democratic party,</i>
<i>the radical socialist party...</i>

523
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,696
<i>and various other elements</i>
<i>who are united in the common aim...</i>

524
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,843
<i>to overthrow the regime,</i>
<i>to create the coalition government...</i>

525
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,845
<i>democratic regime in the south...</i>

526
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:11,838
<i>in order to be able to discuss</i>
<i>with the north the provision of Geneva.</i>

527
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:16,421
<i>That means the end of</i>
<i>the occupation regime in the south...</i>

528
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:20,414
<i>and peaceful reunification</i>
<i>between the two parts of Vietnam.</i>

529
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:25,585
Uh, the Front is not what you
would call a puppet of Hanoi.

530
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,733
The two
organizations —

531
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,736
and I do stress
they are two
organizations —

532
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,671
work very closely together.

533
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:36,274
Many of their aims are parallel aims...

534
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:39,343
but their ideas do not always coincide...

535
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:43,336
and, indeed, sometimes their policies
are in conflict.

536
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,651
<i>[Corson]</i>
<i>A land reform was a total failure.</i>

537
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:50,621
<i>They were sporadic attempts</i>
<i>to try and deal with land...</i>

538
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,890
<i>but they never had</i>
<i>any real support from Diem.</i>

539
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,760
<i>[Buttinger]</i>
<i>What he did was that he gave...</i>

540
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,753
<i>to the 1,200,000 tenants...</i>

541
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,733
<i>some land.</i>

542
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,336
<i>Actually, didn't give it to them.</i>

543
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:09,329
<i>He sanctioned the fact</i>
<i>that the Viet Minh had given it to them.</i>

544
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:13,544
<i>But he made them pay for it now.</i>

545
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:17,537
<i>The downhill trend of the Diem regime...</i>

546
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,220
is best described...

547
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,890
by the increase of corruption...

548
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,793
by the increase of the influence...

549
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,786
of a near psychopath
like his brother Nhu...

550
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:35,633
and his wife, Madame Nhu...

551
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,803
both of whom had a drive for power...

552
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,640
which I can only describe
as pathological.

553
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,942
I had, once, dinner with them...

554
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,879
and Nhu told me, "You see...

555
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,282
"we could have an opposition in Vietnam...

556
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,351
"if I led it...

557
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:57,344
"but since I'm the only
intelligent man in South Vietnam...

558
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,291
"all my mental capacity...

559
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,394
<i>"goes into leading my brother...</i>

560
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:06,230
<i>"to rule South Vietnam.</i>

561
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,799
<i>I have nothing left</i>
<i>to organize an opposition. "</i>

562
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,402
<i>Now, this kind of conceit is,</i>
<i>of course, pathological.</i>

563
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:15,395
<i>However, this man gained</i>
<i>more and more influence over Diem...</i>

564
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:20,278
<i>together with his wife.</i>

565
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,271
<i>[Corson] This is the kind of psychology</i>
<i>you had in a turbulent, changing Asia.</i>

566
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,218
<i>This old, sort of mandarin idea</i>
<i>that I am</i>—

567
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,987
<i>I have this almost divine right to rule.</i>

568
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:32,957
<i>How can you challenge what I say,</i>
<i>because I'm incorruptible?</i>

569
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:35,826
Staley bought this strategic hamlet
from Nhu.

570
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:39,764
Nhu brought it out as a new little goodie —
no pun intended —

571
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,667
but came up
with the strategic hamlet...

572
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:46,660
and this amounted to the same old approach
of forced relocation...

573
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,639
the living behind bars...

574
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,643
the total regimentation of the social
and the fabric of the society.

575
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,780
One of the more significant things
about the strategic hamlet...

576
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,773
is that they were physically
and literally demolished by the Vietcong...

577
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,820
after Diem and Nhu were killed.

578
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,657
Every stick was taken down
and every piece of wire.

579
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,293
The enemy took this off
to make use of it...

580
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,430
and told the people,
"Return to your ancestral homes."

581
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,423
And at that time they began to take
effective control over the countryside.

582
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:22,373
<i>[Halberstam]</i>
<i>Diem was corrupted on vanity and power...</i>

583
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,042
<i>Nhu on his own ego...</i>

584
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,311
<i>Madame Nhu, certainly, on power.</i>

585
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,781
<i>She was the one who really understood</i>
<i>what they were doing the most.</i>

586
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:34,385
<i>She was the most realistic one.</i>

587
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:38,378
<i>She had no illusions about them.</i>
<i>She was a smart, strong, dynamic woman.</i>

588
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:42,927
<i>No illusions about herself.</i>
<i>And she tended to set policy.</i>

589
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,929
<i>She knew what they wanted.</i>

590
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,765
<i>She didn't worry about</i>
<i>what the Americans were saying</i>—

591
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,800
<i>be nice, or do this nice, popular thing.</i>

592
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,036
<i>The important thing to her</i>
<i>was the survival of the family.</i>

593
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:56,029
<i>Anybody who got in the way</i>
<i>of the survival of the family was a threat.</i>

594
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,267
In this affair, I do not think
that we should worry too much...

595
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,814
because we have the same faith.

596
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:07,807
Whatever happens in my country,
we shall not feel it alone.

597
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:11,289
You, also —You will feel it.

598
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,425
The base of Diem was his army,
which was American-supported...

599
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,594
and American aid coming through...

600
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,596
and the police force...

601
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,589
and, generally, an increasingly
police-state technique.

602
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,960
But there was no dissent. They controlled
the legislature, which was a rubber stamp.

603
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,976
About the question
of a horrible stamp...

604
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,312
I have repeatedly said...

605
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:38,305
"But what's wrong to have a stamp
the laws we approve?"

606
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:42,753
A major policy paper issued
by the State Department...

607
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,489
in December of 1961...

608
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,626
stated flatly— and I quote...

609
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:52,496
"The years 1956 to 1960...

610
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,866
"produced something close
to an economic miracle...

611
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:58,002
"in South Vietnam.

612
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,939
"It is a report of progress
over a few brief years...

613
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:05,932
equaled by few young countries."

614
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:09,046
It has been said by Confucius,
wonderfully well —

615
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,416
He said, "Never have laws too precise...

616
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:16,409
"because the precision of the law
gives a possibility to get around it.

617
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:20,980
"Have laws
that are built by governments...

618
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:23,994
"which are reliable,
which know you...

619
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,030
which are close to you."

620
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,023
And this is how, in the organization
of the Vietnamese society...

621
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,570
the village was so essential.

622
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,563
And I think that this has been
the great mistake of Ngo Dinh Diem —

623
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,144
to replace the leader of the village...

624
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,813
who was the expression
of the country...

625
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:45,449
the expression, as they say...

626
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,119
of the wind and the water...

627
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,121
of the locality.

628
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,657
He replaced that
by appointed village chiefs.

629
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:57,650
Now, when the Vietcong
assassinated village chiefs...

630
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,831
they were not at all village chiefs...

631
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:03,934
but people who were not
belonging there...

632
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,104
and it was a scandal to a village
to have them there.

633
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:11,097
And so when the Vietcong assassinated
so many of those people —

634
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,112
and I am not a man
who likes to hear...

635
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:18,149
that people have been assassinated —

636
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:21,652
And some of them might have been
very good people.

637
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,422
The majority might have
been acceptable...

638
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,958
if they had been
the expression of the village.

639
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:31,662
But at the very point
where the Vietnamese nation...

640
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:34,098
the Vietnamese earth...

641
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,001
arises and speaks
to the government...

642
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,703
through the — not chiefs —

643
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,906
through the representatives
of the village...

644
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,208
the elders of the village...

645
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:48,201
at that very point
where the life of the country is...

646
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,572
Ngo Dinh Diem put, simply...

647
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:57,054
a wet blanket of functionaries.

648
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,690
Just at the point where was...

649
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,692
the life of the country...

650
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:05,685
he brought the extinguishing methods...

651
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,723
of a government which was not
a government for the Vietnamese.

652
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:15,206
<i>[Buttinger]</i>
<i>One of the very significant events...</i>

653
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,542
<i>toward the end of the Diem regime...</i>

654
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:22,513
<i>which indicated</i>
<i>the degree of decay...</i>

655
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:26,016
<i>particularly in the morale</i>
<i>of the army...</i>

656
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,752
<i>was the Battle of Ap Bac.</i>

657
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:31,856
<i>It indicated that, militarily...</i>

658
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,091
<i>the Diem regime...</i>

659
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:37,695
<i>was unable to handle the insurrection...</i>

660
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:41,565
<i>and it brought about</i>
<i>discussions in Washington...</i>

661
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:45,135
<i>which eventually led to the decision...</i>

662
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,304
<i>to put in our own troops...</i>

663
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:51,297
<i>and not only our equipment.</i>

664
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:55,869
<i>[John F. Kennedy] The vice-president's</i>
<i>journey represented a great public service.</i>

665
00:41:56,046 --> 00:42:00,039
There are members from both parties
here today to greet him.

666
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:04,154
There were members of both parties
in his group...

667
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,190
going around the world.

668
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:10,183
This was an American effort
to indicate our great concern...

669
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:14,287
for the cause of freedom
in insignificant and important countries...

670
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:18,536
around the world.

671
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:22,273
We visited in several countries...

672
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:25,209
<i>where the population...</i>

673
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,202
<i>would add up to more than</i>
<i>three-quarters of a billion people.</i>

674
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,017
<i>We didn't see all of those people,</i>
<i>but we saw a good many of them...</i>

675
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:36,220
<i>as well as their leaders.</i>

676
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,213
<i>We never heard a hostile voice</i>
<i>and we never shook a hostile hand.</i>

677
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,730
When Vice-PresidentJohnson...

678
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,066
which was also part
of the '61 arrangement —

679
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,236
When he came to Vietnam,
he announced...

680
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:56,073
a series of things
that the United States was going to do.

681
00:42:56,073 --> 00:43:00,066
And this is when we made
a fundamental change in our policy.

682
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,213
I can remember Bernard Fall in 1962...

683
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:05,916
<i>interviewing Pham Van Dong,</i>
<i>the prime minister...</i>

684
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,352
<i>of North Vietnam...</i>

685
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,822
<i>and talking about the American aid.</i>

686
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,158
<i>And Pham Van Dong was saying...</i>

687
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:18,151
<i>"Poor Diem. Poor Diem.</i>
<i>He is unpopular.</i>

688
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,365
<i>"And because he is unpopular...</i>

689
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,901
<i>"the Americans must give him aid.</i>

690
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:26,403
<i>"And because the Americans</i>
<i>give him aid...</i>

691
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:28,739
<i>"he becomes less popular.</i>

692
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:32,643
<i>"And because he becomes less popular,</i>
<i>the Americans must give him more aid.</i>

693
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:36,413
<i>And because they give him more aid,</i>
<i>he becomes even less popular. "</i>

694
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:39,149
Bernard Fall interrupted and said,
"That sounds like a vicious circle."

695
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:43,142
Pham Van Dong paused and said,
"No, not a vicious circle.

696
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,823
A downward spiral."

697
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,859
I'm Roger Hillsman.

698
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,929
I was Director of Intelligence and Research
in the State Department...

699
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,931
underJohn F. Kennedy...

700
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:57,635
and then Assistant Secretary of State
for Far Eastern Affairs...

701
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,628
under Kennedy and, for a while,
under PresidentJohnson.

702
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:10,047
[Clamoring]

703
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:13,217
[Screaming]

704
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:17,210
<i>[Siren Wailing]</i>

705
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,369
<i>[Hillsman] The most dramatic</i>
<i>was one day in Saigon...</i>

706
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,472
<i>when a Buddhist parade</i>
<i>started off.'...</i>

707
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:37,808
<i>with a sort of a hypnotic chant...</i>

708
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,944
<i>the yellow-robed priests...</i>

709
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:42,780
<i>marching along.</i>

710
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,773
And then there stepped forward
a very frail old man in his 70s...

711
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:51,955
who turned out to be
this priest Quang Duc.

712
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,158
And he assumed the lotus posture.

713
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:58,151
<i>Another priest stepped forward</i>
<i>and poured gasoline over him.</i>

714
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:02,388
<i>But I don't think anything really gives</i>
<i>the flavor or the fever of that time...</i>

715
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:07,304
more than to point out that
when this monk burned himself...

716
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:11,297
Ngo Dinh Diem really believed that American
television networks had staged this.

717
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,746
They had paid the Buddhists
to stage this burning for their own benefit.

718
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:19,049
I mean, after all,
the Americans were Diem's allies.

719
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,486
And then suddenly, a towering flame.

720
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:25,889
<i>And the priests and the nuns</i>
<i>in the audience...</i>

721
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,860
<i>moaned and prostrated themselves</i>
<i>towards this burning figure.</i>

722
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,063
<i>And he sat there, unflinching...</i>

723
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,500
<i>and the smell of gasoline</i>
<i>and ofburning flesh in the air...</i>

724
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,302
<i>for 10 minutes.</i>

725
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,205
<i>The political effects of this</i>
<i>were enormous.</i>

726
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,373
<i>It was so dramatic.</i>

727
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,009
<i>It hit the headlines</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

728
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:49,146
It had enormous
political consequences...

729
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:52,316
outside of Vietnam
and inside of Vietnam.

730
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:56,309
Uh, people thought they saw...

731
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:59,389
the face of Buddha
in the clouds that night.

732
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,826
People have spoken very much about...

733
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:06,296
the monks who burned themselves.

734
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,066
But those monks
who burned themselves...

735
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,836
burned themselves because
they were incited to do it.

736
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:16,829
<i>[Halberstam] The American idea, which</i>
<i>was "sink or swim with Ngo Dinh Diem"</i>—

737
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:20,144
<i>as my colleague Homer Bigart</i>
<i>had coined the phrase</i>—

738
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,480
I think the idea of that was, well,
that he had become an expendable man.

739
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,473
American policy had always been
that he was the only man we had.

740
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:31,855
Johnson had called him
the Winston Churchill of Southeast Asia...

741
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:35,159
which is a unique tribute
to Mr. Churchill.

742
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:39,152
So I think with this, they had changed
the American policy view —

743
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,266
that they were expendable.

744
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:45,068
<i>What happened was, of course,</i>
<i>the coup did take place...</i>

745

<i>on that day in November,</i>
<i>and they were murdered.</i>

746
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,608
<i>It had taken place in an atmosphere...</i>

747
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,945
<i>where the Americans, who had,</i>
<i>in a sense created this regime...</i>

<i>who had given it</i>
<i>what little sustenance it had...</i>

00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,484
<i>whose invention Ngo Dinh Diem</i>
<i>had really always been...</i>

750
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,252
<i>had withdrawn.</i>

751
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,355

<i>take his cities without even a fight.</i>

752
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,991
<i>The V.C. Were running rampant</i>
<i>over the countryside.</i>

<i>Would Kennedy have done</i>
<i>whatJohnson has done?</i>

792
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:31,710
There were two things that he
very, very much wished to avoid.

793
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:36,126
One was making this an American war.

794
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,830
As he used to say,
"It's their war— the South Vietnamese.

795
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:43,266
"We can give them aid.
We can even give them advisers.

796
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,469
But they must win it or lose it."

797
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:49,272
And I think he was fully prepared
to let them lose it...

798
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,475
rather than make it an American war.

799
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:55,479
He felt that if we put Americans
in there, with their white faces...

800
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:59,416
it would drive nationalism
into the arms of communism.

801
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:03,409
The second thing he wished to avoid was
internationalizing the war, as we called it.

802
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,823
By this we meant bombing the north
or attacking the north.

803
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:09,493
First and foremost
because it would not work.

804
00:52:09,493 --> 00:52:13,486
And here 30-some odd months of bombing
has shown that his judgment was right.

805
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:18,591
I think that, uh, there's
great danger in this country, uh...

806
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,173
because of the fact that
so much of our economy...

807
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,476
is geared, uh, in the military area.

808
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,246
There is grave danger of, uh...

809
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:33,239
a military-industrial alliance
of a kind...

810
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,187
uh...

811
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:39,856
actually affecting policy.

812
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:43,849
Now, uh, Vietnam is a case in point.

813
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:48,331
Uh, not the only place, because
we're spending $50 billion a year...

And, uh, I do think that, uh...

817

having dropped more bombs on Vietnam...

818
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,835
than were dropped by all the Allied powers
in World War II, in tonnage...

819
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,782

<i>- [Applause Resumes]</i>

00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,897
And I just wish that, uh, uh...

833
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,899
we would decide to win the war...

834

and that we would step out
and close the port of Haiphong...

00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:36,373
and hit every military,
renumerative target over there.

836
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:40,366
I think you're, uh, a better chance to bring
the communists to the conference table...

837
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,446
than if we do not hurt them.

838
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,750
However, American instinct makes us
want to jump in with both feet...

839
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,553
and get an unpleasant job over with
as soon as possible.

840
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:53,790
But traditional Oriental patience...

841
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,960
makes them willing
to carry on the struggle...

842
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,953
into generation after generation,
if necessary.

843
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,903
We're fighting a war over there...

844
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,905
with a commodity...

845
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:11,007
most precious to us...

846
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:14,377
and held far more cheaply
by the enemy—

847
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,379
the lives of men.

848
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:20,372
I don't think it's necessary to have
an invasion of North Vietnam.

849
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:23,520
It would be just exactly
what the enemy wants.

850
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,513
He'd like us to put down 100,000 men
in the field, and they'd put down 100,000.

851
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:31,461
They're willing to lose half of theirs,
and ours is a precious commodity.

852
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:35,065
I wouldn't trade one dead American
for 50 dead Chinamen.

853
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:39,058
We must fight the war from <i>our</i> strength,
not the enemy's.

854
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:43,006
We must fight it
at least cost to ourselves...

855
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,076
and at greatest cost to the enemy.

856
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:50,069
We must change the currency of this game
from men to material.

857
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:52,482
What's that?

858
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:55,485
What is the greatest single problem
we're facing in Vietnam?

859
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,487
Well, it's the despicable
communist enemy.

860
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,489
No question about it.

861
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:02,492
And the sooner we smash him,
as we should have done in Korea —

862
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:05,995
If we'd done it in Korea,
in our first test of arms with communism...

863
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:09,933
we wouldn't be confronted, I don't think,
with the situation we have in Vietnam.

864
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:13,370
Do you have respect for the Vietcong?
Do you think they're a good soldier?

865
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:17,363
Well, there's no question about it.
They're willing to die readily, as all Orientals are.

866
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:21,600
And their leaders will sacrifice them,
and we won't sacrifice ours.

867
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,981
The only solution I see...

868
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:28,084
is to use our strength —
our air and naval power—

869
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:32,088
in the most humane possible m —
manner— manner possible...

870
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:36,081
to destroy North Vietnamese
capability to wage war...

871
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,829
against the free people
of South Vietnam.

872
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,633
So I think the sooner that we hit
everything we can and hurt 'em over there...

873
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,069
we got a better chance
to win that war...

874
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,605
and that's exactly what we should do,
in my opinion.

875
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:52,598
So, the harbor at Haiphong...

876
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:56,746
and the entire capacity
to receive outside help — close it.

And, if necessary, the irrigation system,
on which food production largely depends.

889
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,793
We must be willing
to continue our bombing...

890

until we've destroyed every work of man
in North Vietnam...

if this is what it takes
to win the war.

892
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,169
Then there was
a little crisis there.

893
00:57:53,169 --> 00:57:56,172
The military thought that
there was a great infiltration.

894
00:57:56,172 --> 00:58:00,165
Secretary McNamara went out, came back
and said, "No, there wasn't a crisis at that time."

895
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:03,179
But I thought
it was very significant...

896
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,282
that PresidentJohnson
then appointed a committee...

897
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:09,953
to prepare a list of targets in the north...

898
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:13,289
in case he should decide
to bomb the north.

899
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:16,292
The more I thought about this,
the more I became convinced...

900
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:20,296
that if there were a crisis,
he would escalate the war.

901
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:22,999
This is part of
the steady escalation...

902
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,903
that's taken place
during the last five years.

903
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:29,639

were also in combat.

00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,545
Then we sent in the marines...

906
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,548
and the first thing was said was
they were only there to defend.

907
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:42,018
The next thing was that
they were to shoot back if attacked.

908
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:46,011
And now there is an admission
that we're all in.

909
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:50,816
Some others are eager
to enlarge the conflict.

910
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,866
They call upon us
to supply American boys...

911
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,603
to do the job
that Asian boys should do.

912
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:03,673
They ask us to take
reckless action...

913
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:06,009
which might risk
the lives of millions...

914
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,978
and engulf much of Asia...

915
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:12,971
and certainly threaten the peace
of the entire world.

916
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,552
A second deliberate attack...

917
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,321
was made
during darkness...

918
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:20,557
by an
undetermined number...

919
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,893
of North Vietnamese P.T. Boats...

920
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,886
on the U.S. S<i>. Maddox</i>
and the U.S. S<i>. C. TurnerJoy...</i>

921
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:33,169
while the two destroyers
were cruising in company...

922
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:36,039
on routine patrol duty...

923
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,041
in the Tonkin Gulf...

924
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:40,143
in international waters...

925
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,780
some 65 miles
from the nearest point of land.

926
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:47,183
They put out that propaganda,
but they got caught...

927
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:50,353
because we were able to disclose
within two days...

928
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:54,346
that if they would check upon the log
of the <i>Maddox,</i> for example...

929
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:59,952
they would find she
was only 11 to 13 miles...

930
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,332
from the bombing of those islands.

931
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,334
And, of course, that's coverage.

932
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:07,804
And the North Vietnamese
knew that it was coverage.

933
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:11,808
<i>[Reporter] Do our naval vessels</i>
<i>afford any cover for these</i>—

934
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:13,810
<i>those operations?</i>

935
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,012
Our naval vessels
afford no cover whatsoever.

936
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:19,015
Now, the sad fact is,
history will record...

937
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:23,008
that the United States
was an aggressor in Tonkin Bay.

938
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:25,688
We were violating the rights
of North Vietna —

939
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:28,992
They had no right to proceed
on the second day...

940
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:31,661
to, ourselves, bomb...

941
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,663
uh, North Vietnam —

942
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:37,656
the areas where
her torpedo boats were kept.

943
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,903
But we had a duty—
That wasn't self-defense.

944
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:44,674
Bombing North Vietnam was not
within the right of the president...

945
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:47,176
to act in self-defense
of the republic.

946
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:51,180
My duties on board
the seaplane tender were...

947
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,784
nuclear weapons officer.

948
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:56,786
On August 4...

949
01:00:56,786 --> 01:01:00,223
there was an alleged attack
upon the U.S. S<i>. Maddox...</i>

950
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,225
<i>and</i> TurnerJoy...

951
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,227
<i>two of our destroyers...</i>

952
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:06,195
<i>in the Gulf of Tonkin.</i>

953
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:10,188
Destroyer personnel indicated at first
that they were under attack...

954
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:15,360
and later indicated uncertainty
as to whether or not they were under attack.

955
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,410
Large numbers of torpedoes...

956
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,746
were supposed to have been fired.

957
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,883
The ship was, uh...

958
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:30,876
reporting itself as continuously maneuvering
to avoid torpedo attack...

959
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:35,892
and yet there was also indicated
in these messages...

960
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,895
doubt as to whether or not
they were under attack at all.

961
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:42,131
And I have a feeling, therefore,
that this harassment attack...

962
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:46,124
and this attack with 20 or more torpedoes
upon two of our destroyers...

963
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:50,907
was designed to force us out,
in a way...

964
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:53,042
lest we precipitate
a greater struggle.

965
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,379
I have a feeling that they've
misread America once again.

966
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,382
In the course of our conversation...

967
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:03,386
this chief petty officer told me
that he was a sonar man...

968
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,488
on board the U.S. S<i>. Maddox...</i>

969
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:08,491
and that he had been in sonar—
the sonar room —

970
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,860
during the attack.

971
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:14,864
He told me that,
in his estimation...

972
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:18,857
there were no torpedoes
fired at the ship or otherwise...

973
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,237
during that alleged attack...

974
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:25,230
and furthermore,
he constantly repeated this —

975
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:29,534
uh, sent this information
to the commanding officer on the bridge.

976
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:32,215
<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>The North Vietnamese...</i>

977
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,217
<i>have no submarines.</i>

978
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,219
<i>What is the purpose</i>
<i>of that movement?</i>

979
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,221
This is purely precautionary...

980
01:02:38,221 --> 01:02:41,224
so that the fleet will be prepared
for all eventualities.

981
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:43,226
<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>What sort of eventualities, General?</i>

982
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:45,495
- Well, possible submarine attack.
<i>- By whom?</i>

983
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,497
By anyone.

984
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:51,200
<i>[Reporter] Well, you always contended</i>
<i>that in the first incident they were having</i>—

985
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,193
I am contending that having
the <i>Maddox</i> and the <i>Joy</i> there...

986
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:57,907
constituted...

987
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:01,544
in view of the knowledge as to what
the South Vietnamese boats were up to...

988
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:04,147
an act of constructive aggression
on our part.

989
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,316
The Vietnamese situation...

990
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:11,309
as I noted on my visit back home
last week and this week...

991
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:17,415
has taken on some real spirit
and real interest.

992
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:21,920
I thought perhaps a statement by
the joint senate-house Republican leadership...

993
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:27,793
would be timely and quite in order
at this moment.

994
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,207
As a result of what we have done
in South Vietnam...

995
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:35,200
not only has
the psychology changed there...

996
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,314
but also it has had
a most beneficial effect...

997
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,316
in my opinion...

998
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:43,619
among other free Asian countries...

999
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,612
who looked at South Vietnam
as a test.

1000
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:50,993
Okay, today—

1001
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,995
<i>today's the day.</i>

1002
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:56,399
<i>It's the big one.</i>
<i>This is the one we've been waiting for.</i>

1003
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:59,168
<i>This is the one you've all been</i>
<i>saying to yourselves...</i>

1004
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,338
<i>"What this company needs</i>
<i>is a good fight. "</i>

1005
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:06,331
<i>By the grace of God, we're gonna get it.</i>

1006
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:10,602
<i>From there we're gonna "S"and "D"</i>—
<i>search and destroy, the thing you guys like.</i>

1007
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,451
<i>Okay.</i>

1008
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,421
<i>Some of you, I know this is</i>
<i>gonna be a shock to you...</i>

1009
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,423
<i>but it's a switch</i>
<i>for ol'Alpha Troop</i>—

1010
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:24,416
<i>we're ridin'in, and we're not ridin'in</i>
<i>on one of those dusty ol'A.P.C. 's.</i>

<i>We're goin'in first-class.</i>
<i>T. W.A.</i> — <i>Teeny-Weeny Airlines.</i>

1012
01:04:28,931 --> 01:04:31,601
[Soldiers Laughing]

1013
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:35,538
Well, search and destroy
is an attempt to...

1014
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,974
<i>as the first word would indicate...</i>

1015
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,109
<i>to find the enemy...</i>

1016
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:42,912
<i>to search out where he would be...</i>

1017
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:45,648
<i>and then to destroy him</i>
<i>in his habitat.</i>

1018
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:47,884
<i>[Soldiers Shouting]</i>

1019
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,886
<i>[Officer]</i>
<i>Okay.!</i>

1020
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,879
West of the stream
and east of the road. Roger.

1021
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:36,332
<i>How much rice do you think</i>
<i>is actually in there?</i>

1022
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:40,169
Oh, geez, I don't know.
About...

1023
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:42,305
20 tons, 10 tons.

1024
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:44,307
How far back does it go?

1025
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:48,177
<i>It's about 30 by 15.</i>

1026
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:51,280
<i>Anyways, about 12 feet deep.</i>

1027
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,416
- Come on.
<i>- [Explosion In Distance]</i>

1028
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:56,152
<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>How do you destroy this much rice?</i>

1029
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,554
<i>[Soldier]</i>
<i>The demo man usually blows it up.</i>

1030
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:02,325
<i>- [Reporter] You gonna blow it up?</i>
<i>- If they can't get it out, they'll blow it up.</i>

1031
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:06,318
<i>It's, uh, unmilled rice.</i>

1032
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:16,461
Oh, look at that.

1033
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:26,571
<i>[Reporter] Here's all the detachment consists of</i>—
<i>two double-rotored Chinook helicopters.</i>

1034
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,518
<i>The Chinook usually are</i>
<i>cargo or troop carriers.</i>

1035
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:33,511
<i>But not these</i>—
<i>they're gunships.</i>

1036
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:42,320
The prisoners that we've captured are —
that have been captured...

1037
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:47,436
say that this is the most feared weapon
outside the B-52s.

1038
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:51,440
That is because of the amount
of ammunition we carry...

1039
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,433
the various types of weapons
in the amount of time we can stay on station.

1040
01:06:56,445 --> 01:07:00,282
<i>At the present time</i>
<i>we have on this...</i>

1041
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:03,652
<i>a 140-millimeter grenade launcher,</i>
<i>two 20-millimeter cannons...</i>

1042
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:05,654
<i>five 50-caliber machine guns...</i>

1043
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:09,647
<i>and two rocket launcher pods</i>
<i>consisting of 192.75 rockets.</i>

1044
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:15,220
<i>Uh, we usually carry inside</i>
<i>two additional M60 machine guns...</i>

1045
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,401
and ammunition for them.

1046
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:22,394
Occasionally, the crew rat-holes a few things
they don't tell us about until they're airborne.

1047
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:26,409
<i>If we work at it,</i>
<i>we can unload in about 20-25 minutes.</i>

1048
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:30,246
<i>But we are in danger ofburning out</i>
<i>barrels, which we frequently do.</i>

1049
01:07:30,246 --> 01:07:32,681
<i>I was amazed,</i>
<i>when I came to this outfit...</i>

1050
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,683
<i>how accurate the 50-calibers were.</i>

1051
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:38,387
<i>I figured they would be</i>
<i>no more than aerial spray weapons.</i>

1052
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,390
<i>But they can actually walk those weapons</i>
<i>right down a tree line.</i>

1053
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:44,627
<i>Now, the 20-millimeter is, of course,</i>
<i>very, very accurate and has quite a range.</i>

1054
01:07:44,627 --> 01:07:48,620
<i>We can start firing this machine 4,000 meters</i>
<i>away, which is a considerable distance.</i>

1055
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:55,193
<i>The one I fly</i>
<i>is known as "Birth Control."</i>

1056
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:30,573
You look like
you enjoy your work. Why?

1057
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:34,566
Well, I been doin' it for 36 months
since I been in the service.

1058
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,380
<i>It's the type of work I enjoy</i>—
<i>outside, moving around.</i>

1059
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:42,251
<i>But this particular operation,</i>
<i>the cedar falls, why are you enjoying this?</i>

1060
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:45,254
<i>Well, I think were benefiting</i>
<i>by clearing all this area.</i>

1061
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:49,247
<i>This is the first time we've got a push on</i>
<i>like this and haven't walked off and left it.</i>

1062
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,294
<i>They're completely going right ahead</i>
<i>and pushing on forward...</i>

1063
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:56,287
<i>instead of walking off.</i>

1064
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:13,671
<i>- Where did you find these people?</i>
<i>- They live in the village of Dong Lien...</i>

1065
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,218

<i>and the railroad to the west.</i>

1066

<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>Why'd you bring 'em in here?</i>

1067
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:21,746
<i>[Soldier] We've had so much trouble</i>
<i>when we've moved through this area.</i>
<i>Been a lot of civilians killed as a result of this.</i>

1068
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,927
<i>As we made our pass through here</i>
<i>we picked these people up...</i>

1069
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:28,430
<i>and moved 'em with us into here</i>
<i>so that we could make a careful sweep...</i>

1070
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:32,423
<i>and probe each and every hut, looking for</i>
<i>tunnels and caves, possible V.C. Hiding places.</i>

1071
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:34,937
<i>We found a few caves...</i>

1072
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:38,574
and blew 'em, picked up some weapons,
killed a few V.C.

1073
01:09:38,574 --> 01:09:42,578
We're now gonna sweep back through,
go to the railroad and move back to the west.

1074
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,681
- What's gonna happen to the people tonight?
<i>- Well, we're gonna keep 'em right here.</i>

1075
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,651
<i>We've got some chow for 'em, some water.</i>
<i>We'll feed 'em.</i>

1076
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:52,644
<i>You'd be surprised how they can take care</i>
<i>of themselves with a minimum of resources.</i>

1077
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,358
<i>They take care of these children here</i>
<i>during the night.</i>

1078
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:59,261
They'll huddle real close together.
They'll keep warm.

1079
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,263

<i>[Reporter] How long are you</i>

1081

<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>How did you select them?</i>

1090
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:31,293
<i>These</i> chieu hoi <i>people</i>—

<i>they know these people...</i>

<i>these people know more than they're telling us.</i>

1093
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,972
<i>We take 'em back to get</i>
<i>a little higher echelon of interrogation...</i>

<i>down at Hoi Yen or Dinh Banh.</i>

<i>Some of these people</i>
<i>come back to us, even...</i>

1096
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:51,380
<i>and we'll put 'em with our companies</i>
<i>to sweep these riverbanks.</i>

1097
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,984
<i>It's hard to knowjust who a V.C. Is</i>
<i>unless he's carrying a weapon...</i>

1098
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,986

<i>or some grenades or somethin'!</i>

1100
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,826
<i>But then, some of these people</i>
<i>that have operated with the V. C...</i>

1101
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:07,819
<i>and if they defect and come over,</i>
<i>we can use these people as scouts.</i>

1102
01:11:08,464 --> 01:11:11,033
<i>They go along riverbanks with us,</i>
<i>and they look just like anybody else.</i>

1103
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:15,026
<i>But when they have a weapon,</i>
<i>then they're free game.</i>

1104
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:20,309
<i>[Reporter]</i>
<i>How did this man get killed?</i>

1105
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,311
<i>[Soldier]</i>
<i>He threw grenades at the marines.</i>

1106
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:25,314
<i>Instead ofjust one, he threw three,</i>
<i>and a marine spotted him...</i>

1107
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,316
<i>and started shooting at him...</i>

1108
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:29,318
<i>and that's how he got it.</i>

1109
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:33,311
<i>Those two big holes by his eye and throat</i>
<i>were done by 30.06 sniper rifles.</i>

1110
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:37,382
<i>All the rest of the holes are done</i>
<i>by this new type of rifle we got, the M16.</i>

1111
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:41,497
<i>[Reporter] How about all these people</i>
<i>who are standing behind me over there?</i>

1112
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:44,500
<i>- Do you think any of them know this man?</i>
<i>- Yes, they do.</i>

1113
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,502
<i>But they wouldn't admit it...</i>

1114
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:50,372
<i>because they're afraid that we will</i>
<i>take them back to C.P. For questioning...</i>

1115
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,741
<i>and detain them...</i>

1116
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,743
under this R.V.N. Program...

1117
01:11:54,743 --> 01:11:57,746
where they teach them propaganda for
three months — they hold 'em for three months.

1118
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:00,416
That's why they won't admit
they know this man here.

1119
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:04,409
We've put over three million of them
into what I would call a concentration camp.

1120
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,723
They call it a refugee center.

1121
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,326
It's got barbed wire around it.
They can't get out of it.

1122
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,329
We've taken these people
from the graves of their ancestors...

1123
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:15,331
from their rice paddies...

1124
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:18,734
and we say, "Oh, well,
we've pacified X-million people."

1125
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:22,438
Yeah, we've pacified some more people
by putting them in these camps.

1126
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,440
I'll wind this up in a hurry.

1127
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,743
I know many people have said
we've killed innocent people.

1128
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:31,747
Our bombs have killed civilians
and babies and mothers...

1129
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:34,583
and I suppose
there is truth to that.

1130
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:38,153
There have been people
that have been killed.

1131
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:41,657
But your government
has not bombed civilians.

1132
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,727
Your government
has not bombed open cities.

1133
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:48,720
Your government has sent its bombers in
after targets — military targets...

1134
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:52,924
that have been placed in an area
surrounded by civilians.

1135
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,540
Try a sweep-around?

1136
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,844
<i>[Corson] The unfortunate thing is,</i>
<i>the enemy is quite frequently located...</i>

1137
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:05,837
<i>in areas that have people who are</i>
<i>not part of the military structure...</i>

1138
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:08,684
<i>in an immediate sense.</i>

1139
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:12,677
<i>They may be sympathizers. They may be</i>
<i>supporting through their efforts, their work.</i>

1140
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:17,559
<i>But what occurs when you engage</i>
<i>in a search and destroy...</i>

1141
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,695
<i>is the destruction</i>—
<i>the needless destruction</i>—

1142
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:22,631
<i>of innocent human</i>—
<i>innocent civilians.</i>

1143
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:26,624
<i>Now, you might say that they're all part</i>
<i>of the entire communist apparatus.</i>

1144
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:31,673
<i>But the feature is that if we are going to</i>
<i>prevent this war from degenerating...</i>

1145
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:33,675
<i>into a genocidal activity...</i>

1146
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,211
<i>then our attempt</i>
<i>would be to rehabilitate...</i>

1147
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:40,204
or to wean those folks away from
the communists, rather than to destroy them.

1148
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:45,576
<i>This is what search and destroy becomes</i>
<i>in a very practical sense.</i>

1149
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:49,680
<i>[Explosions, Mortar Fire]</i>

1150
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,741
They are the subject
of our constant concern...

1151
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,743
because
they're such
a magnificent...

1152
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,745
group of
fighting men.

1153
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:11,747
Their morale is extremely high.

1154
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:13,749
They always have a smile.

1155
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:17,742
I was at a very
kind of sobering thing last night —

1156
01:14:18,754 --> 01:14:21,757
a memorial service for four men
in the 2nd Squadron...

1157
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:25,750
who were killed the other day,
one of them being a medic.

1158
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:28,564
And the place was just packed.

1159
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:31,700
We sang three hymns
and had a nice prayer.

1160
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,703
I turned around and looked at their faces...

1161
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,539
and they were —
I was just proud.

1162
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:41,532
My feeling for America just soared
because of their—

1163
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,546
the way they looked.

1164
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:48,539
They looked determined
and, and reverent at the same time.

1165
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:52,743
But still, they're a bloody good
bunch of killers.

1166
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:57,726
When a captive is taken by...

1167
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:01,296
the United States
or free world forces...

1168

<i>he is, following interrogation...</i>

1169
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,993
<i>uh, turned over to</i>
<i>the Vietnamese authorities.</i>

1170
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,610
<i>These prisoners</i>
<i>are not being mistreated.</i>

1171

<i>They are being handled</i>
<i>in accordance...</i>

1172
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,748
<i>with the provisions...</i>

1173
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:21,750
<i>of the Geneva Conventions.</i>

1174

<i>The prisoners were, uh,</i>
<i>executed in our outfit...</i>

1175
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:29,258
as a standard policy.

1176
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:31,727
We were told by our C. O<i>...</i>

1177
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,729
after our first battle...

1178
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,798
that from then on we weren't
gonna take any prisoners.

1179
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:38,800
My name is John Toller.

1180
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,793
I'm a sergeant in the U.S. Army Special Forces,
known as the Green Berets.

1181
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,073
I'm en route to Vietnam.

1182
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:47,075
However, I'm deserting the army...

1183
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:51,068
because I'm protesting the U.S. Involvement
in the Vietnamese conflict.

1184
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:56,974
Today your soldiers, sailors,
airmen, marines and coast guardsmen...

1185
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,690
are better educated than before...

1186
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,726
are better informed...

1187
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:08,719
have traditional American
ingenuity and initiative...

1188
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:12,100
are better physical specimens...

1189
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,102
have high morale...

1190
01:16:14,102 --> 01:16:17,105
and understand
what the war is all about.

1191
01:16:17,105 --> 01:16:19,107
As I mentioned before...

1192
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:23,078
about changing the minds
of the apathetic populace...

1193
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,581
the key is the communication...

1194
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:29,574
and most of the American soldiers I know
can't communicate.

1195
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:33,388
They don't really understand
the Vietnamese way of life...

1196
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:36,358
and its goal.

1197
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:40,351
And the only way they can communicate
is through money or with a gun.

1198
01:16:41,997 --> 01:16:45,000
So after a while
they develop this kind of fear.

1199
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,836
And so, a misunderstanding
and a noncommunication —

1200
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:50,706
They mistrust the Vietnamese...

1201
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,941
and they kind of despise them.

1202
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,944
Once we got to Vietnam,
it was an entirely different story.

1203
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:59,937
The officers started referring
to the Vietnamese as "gooks."

1204
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:04,075
<i>They even went so far as to say that</i>
<i>the only good gook is a dead gook.</i>

1205
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:09,880
<i>They said, "You can't trust 'em</i>—
<i>You can't trust any of these slant-eyed bastards...</i>

1206
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:14,819
<i>because none of them are no good. "</i>

<i>of corruption and fraud in elections.</i>

1225
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:35,871
Isn't it true, though, that the censorship now
is going to be a little more rigorous...

1226
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:37,873
as soon as the campaign starts?

1227
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,175
No, sir, I don't think so.

1228
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:43,779
But you have said, have you not,
that the Vietnamese press...

1229
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,782
should not criticize
the candidates in the election?

1230
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,184
Why is that, sir?

1231
01:19:49,184 --> 01:19:52,187
Well, it's our formal...

1233
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,160

critici — criticism of each other...

1237
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:13,130
because it created more confusion,
more division among the people.

<i>and a strong effort...</i>

1257
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:22,410
<i>with our very strong support</i>
<i>and endorsement...</i>

<i>[Werfel]</i>

1264
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:43,387
being true to the origin
of the elections in the first place...

1265
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:46,101
was very much concerned...

1266
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:50,094
about how the American people
would interpret these elections...

1267
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:54,398
and he saw that
it was necessary to appoint...

1268
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:58,936
an official observer team.

1269
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:03,140
<i>But, of course, most of the people</i>
<i>had never been in Asia before.</i>

1270
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:07,022
<i>Almost none of them</i>
<i>had ever been in Vietnam before.</i>

1271
01:22:07,022 --> 01:22:10,659
<i>Very few of them even had</i>
<i>any contacts in Vietnam.</i>

1272
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:14,652
<i>So the theoretical opportunity</i>
<i>to talk to anybody they wanted to...</i>

1273
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,599
<i>simply could not be utilized.</i>

1274
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:21,592
<i>In fact, most of those who talked</i>
<i>to anyone except embassy people...</i>

1275
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:24,572
<i>talked to those Vietnamese...</i>

1276
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:27,342
<i>introduced to them...</i>

1277
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:31,335
<i>by embassy people.</i>

1278
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:36,740
<i>Voting officials, voters,</i>
<i>everybody were on their good behavior...</i>

1279
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,955
<i>because the American observers</i>
<i>were there.</i>

1280
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:42,324
<i>So, for them to have expected...</i>

1281
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:45,193
<i>that they would see fraud</i>
<i>with their own eyes...</i>

1282
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:48,196
<i>was, uh, simply absurd.</i>

1283
01:22:48,196 --> 01:22:51,733
<i>Furthermore, they left Vietnam...</i>

1284
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:55,170
<i>within 24 hours</i>
<i>after the polls closed...</i>

1285
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:58,306
<i>and in that period</i>
<i>after the polls closed...</i>

1286
01:22:58,306 --> 01:23:02,299
<i>they did not speak</i>
<i>to a single Vietnamese.</i>

1287
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:06,737
<i>The possession of a clipped</i>
<i>and stamped voting card, of course...</i>

1288
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:11,709
<i>was a very important protection</i>
<i>for the Vietnamese peasant.</i>

1289
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:16,046
<i>It was almost as important as</i>
<i>having his registration card.</i>

1290
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:20,528
<i>And anyone in Vietnam...</i>

1291
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:23,431
<i>who does not have an official</i>
<i>government registration or identity card...</i>

1292
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:25,433
<i>is in deep trouble.</i>

<i>He's immediately assumed</i>
<i>to be a Vietcong...</i>

1294
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:32,162
<i>is taken into the police station</i>
<i>for questioning, or worse.</i>

1295
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:36,734
I saw even in Saigon, uh,
in working-class districts...

1296
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:41,416
where on election day,
rather early in the afternoon...

1297
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:45,409
the polling place ran out of vote —
uh, ran out of, uh, ballots.

1298
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:50,625
And there were people
already lined up...

1299
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,761
wanting to vote
at this polling place.

1300
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:56,231
When it was announced
that they had run out of ballots...

1301
01:23:56,231 --> 01:24:00,224
the poor washer women
and workmen were frightened to death —

1302
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:04,728
"We've got to vote! We've got to vote!
We've got to have our clipped voting card!"

1303
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:09,411
<i>So, uh, in balance...</i>

1304
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:13,248
<i>we had a government elected...</i>

<i>than a third of the vote...</i>

1308
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:26,750
as being a popular

nearly two-thirds of the people
voting against it...

1310
01:24:30,799 --> 01:24:34,792
and even that 35%, of course,
being to a considerable extent...

1311
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:39,329
a result of fraud

not only to their own cause...

1338
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,296
whatever one may think about it...

1339
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:43,731
but perhaps to the cause
of world peace...

1340
01:26:43,731 --> 01:26:47,724
and perhaps most particularly
to the colossus himself.

1341
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:52,006
Maybe we needed
to be brought up short.

1342
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:55,877
Maybe what we've been doing
in Vietnam all along...

1343
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:59,647
is an exercise in what
Senator Fulbright has called...

1344
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:03,351
the arrogance of power.

1345
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:06,821
We cannot retreat...

1346
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:09,357
from anyplace...

1347
01:27:09,357 --> 01:27:12,694
and I can tell you
that we don't intend to retreat.

1348
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:14,829
We were asked
by the State Department...

1349
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:18,499
to prepare a letter
and send it to Ho Chi Minh...

1350
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:21,836
through a channel which had been opened
and was available to us.

1351
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:25,006
We were certain would deliver
the letter directly to him.

1352
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:28,999
It was a very conciliatory letter
written in the State Department...

1353
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:32,981
in consultation, word by word,
with Secretary Bundy...

1354
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:35,850
Secretary Katzenbach and others...

1355
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:38,286
in which we spoke on behalf—

1356
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:40,655
this was the actual phraseology—

1357
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:43,524
"on behalf of" high officials
of the State Department.

1358
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:45,593
All of Asia — free Asia —

1359
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:47,595
as well as communist Asia...

1360
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,597
is watching Vietnam.

1361
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:53,001
And if, for example,
out of this present struggle...

1362
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,703
after making this great commitment...

1363
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:58,706
after turning around
the psychology in Asia...

1364
01:27:58,706 --> 01:28:01,809
we then agree to a coalition government
with the communists...

1365
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:05,680
or we force the South Vietnamese
into a neutralized position...

1366
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:07,749
and neutralize as we did Laos...

1367
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:09,884
or if we make...

1368
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:13,877
any kind of territorial concessions
to the Vietcong...

1369
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,858
either one of these three
courses of action...

1370
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:19,794
would be interpreted as a retreat...

1371
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:23,787
and also a defeat, not only for South Vietnam
but for the United States.

1372
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:27,991
We had an extended interview —
almost two hours —with Ho Chi Minh.

1373
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:31,105
It was perfectly clear,
in the course of that interview...

1374
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:35,098
that Ho Chi Minh was delivering to us
certain information he expected us to deliver...

1375
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,445
back to the State Department.

1376
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,747
And on the side of Ho Chi Minh...

1377
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:43,740
understand that, first of all,
he will bring to the negotiation...

1378
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:48,545
the prestige of an unparalleled life
of devotion to his country.

1379
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:52,393
In the history of this century...

1380
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:55,396
he will be <i>the</i> great patriot.

1381
01:28:55,396 --> 01:28:57,598
And be careful here.

1382
01:28:57,598 --> 01:29:00,601
Don't forget that he is a Marxist.

1383
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:04,594
And don't expect him to turn a traitor
to the ideal of his life.

1384
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:09,777
He was unyielding on the point
that the bombing had to halt...

1385
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:13,770
before his negotiators would enter into
any kind of substantive discussions.

1386
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:17,885
But I think he was trying to make the point,
and making it repeatedly...

1387
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:21,389
that after that the agenda was open.

1388
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:25,382
There may be those who say, well,
obviously you haven't offered them enough.

1389
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:31,766
Well, it's true that we haven't
offered them South Vietnam.

1390
01:29:31,766 --> 01:29:35,470
And it is true that we have not
agreed to assure them...

1391
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:39,463
that we will stop the bombing
on a permanent and unconditional basis.

1392
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:42,777
We discovered sometime later...

1393
01:29:42,777 --> 01:29:46,447
when the correspondence
was made public by Hanoi...

1394
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:50,440
that four days
before our letter could arrive in Hanoi...

1395
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:55,879
a letter arrived there,
sent over PresidentJohnson's signature...

1396
01:29:56,124 --> 01:29:59,127
which was
a very hard line letter indeed...

1397
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:03,120
which restated all the previous conditions
regarding cessation of the bombing...

1398
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,400
and even added some new ones...

1399
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:08,035
and which was, in our judgment...

1400
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:10,037
intended to do what it did do...

1401
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:14,030
which was to break off any possibility
of negotiation at that time.

1402
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:17,478
This letter,
we subsequently learned...

1403
01:30:17,478 --> 01:30:21,471
had been written
two days before ours was written...

1404
01:30:21,849 --> 01:30:24,018
in conjunction with
the State Department.

1405
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:27,989
We found, to our surprise
and shock, I might say...

1406
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:31,982
that Harriman was already saying that
he proposed to negotiate the settlement...

1407
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,553
by suggesting that there had to be
some reciprocal military action...

1408
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:39,901
in return for the final
cessation of the bombing.

1409
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:43,604
In other words, the same point
thatJohnson had been standing on...

1410
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:47,608
<i>before</i> he made the speech
of March 31.

1411
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:50,912
It was almost as though Harriman
turned off his hearing aid...

1412
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:53,047
when we told him this would not work...

1413
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:56,050
this was not the understanding
the North Vietnamese had...

1414
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:58,052
and they would certainly repudiate it...

1415
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:01,189
if he attempted to take that position
at the bargaining table.

1416
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:04,926
And this, of course,
is what did happen at Paris.

1417
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:08,919
In the view of the North Vietnamese...

1418
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:15,091
the reciprocity means...

1419
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:17,872
United States
is bombing North Vietnam...

1420
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:21,142
and North Vietnam
must bomb United States.

1421
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,578
This, in their view, is reciprocity.

1422
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:27,571
Since North Vietnam
is <i>not</i> bombing the United States...

1423
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:31,118
the United States
should not bomb North Vietnam.

1424
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:35,111
The general impression
that I came away with —

1425
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:40,083
and I think here I would speak
for my colleague Bill Baggs —

1426
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:44,721
was that we were dealing
with the State Department...

1427
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,837
on a basis of what we have
come to call Fulbright's Law —

1428
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:52,006
"Never Trust the State Department."

1429
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:55,710
Bombing is going on in the south.

1430
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:57,945
We haven't bombed
anybody's embassy in Hanoi...

1431
01:31:57,945 --> 01:32:01,938
but they've bombed
our embassy in Saigon.

1432
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:06,153
Arms continue to flow.
Men continue to come.

1433
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:10,146
We've tried all over the Earth
to find an answer to the question...

1434
01:32:11,592 --> 01:32:14,595
what else would stop
if the bombing stopped?

1435
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:18,588
The niceties of the argument about
whether there are two Vietnams...

1436
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:20,868
or one Vietnam...

1437
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:24,805
seem quite inconsequential
when you're talking to Ho Chi Minh.

1438
01:32:24,805 --> 01:32:27,008
It would seem incredible...

1439
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:31,001
that this man does not speak
for most of the Vietnamese —

1440
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:33,714
not all, but most —

1441
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:37,351
and the idea that there could be
some arbitrary geographic dividing line...

1442
01:32:37,351 --> 01:32:39,787
that would cut off his influence...

1443
01:32:39,787 --> 01:32:41,956
has been proved an absurdity...

1444
01:32:41,956 --> 01:32:44,659
by the figure and determination...

1445
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:47,028
of the National Liberation Front...

1446
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:50,731
that fights in his name in the south.

1447
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:52,733
My name is Ilya Todd.

1448
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:56,737
I'm a journalist on the non-communist,
liberal, left-wing French paper...

1449
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:58,839
Le nouvel observateur.

1450
01:32:58,839 --> 01:33:02,832
I first went to South Vietnam
when escalations started in 1965...

1451
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:06,881
and I first went to North Vietnam
at the end of 1967.

1452
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:10,284
Uh, I'm Harrison Salisbury
of the <i>New York Times.</i>

1453
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:12,987
Uh, assistant managing editor
of the <i>Times.</i>

1454
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:15,590
I'm, uh, Father Daniel Berrigan.

1455
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:18,125
I'm working here at Cornell teaching...

1456
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:20,828
and helping with the peace movement.

1457
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:23,397
It's about one month
since I was in North Vietnam...

1458
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:26,901
on a project to get
the three American flyers out.

1459
01:33:26,901 --> 01:33:30,371
At the time I went to North Vietnam...

1460
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:34,364
the communiques which were being issued,
by Washington in particular...

1461
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:38,179
<i>about the American bombing raids</i>
<i>on the north...</i>

1462
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:41,616
<i>gave the impression, although</i>
<i>they did not say so specifically...</i>

1463
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:44,285
<i>that we were not killing civilians...</i>

1464
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:47,188
<i>in any substantial numbers,</i>
<i>at least...</i>

1465
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:50,224
<i>in the course of our</i>
<i>very heavy bombing offensive.</i>

1466
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:53,094
<i>Indeed, PresidentJohnson himself</i>
<i>said that the targets...</i>

1467
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:55,696
<i>were, uh, steel and concrete.</i>

1468
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:59,066
<i>I think almost anyone</i>
<i>familiar with war...</i>

1469
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:02,169
<i>would have been somewhat skeptical</i>
<i>of the ability to bomb with such precision.</i>

1470
01:34:02,169 --> 01:34:05,840
<i>And indeed, when I got on the spot</i>
<i>in North Vietnam...</i>

1471
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:09,833
<i>I discovered, of course, that while</i>
<i>the bombs presumably had been aimed...</i>

1472
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:13,648
<i>toward military objectives,</i>
<i>as best the aviators could aim them...</i>

1473
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:16,384
<i>they indeed did kill many civilians...</i>

1474
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:20,254
<i>demolished large areas</i>
<i>of civilian housing.</i>

1475
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:22,256
<i>[Todd]</i>
<i>Before I left for North Vietnam...</i>

1476
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:25,326
<i>I was under the impression</i>
<i>that it was a small country...</i>

1477
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:27,762
that was just sort of
vaguely fighting back.

1478
01:34:27,762 --> 01:34:31,755
But after seeing many battles
against American planes...

1479
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:33,901
<i>from the banks of the Red River...</i>

1480
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:35,870
<i>I changed my opinions completely.</i>

1481
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:38,839
<i>The antiaircraft in North Vietnam...</i>

1482
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:42,832
<i>in certain pockets, as the American</i>
<i>pilots say, is absolutely formidable.</i>

1483
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:46,013
<i>It's a sort of four-level affair.</i>

1484
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:49,684
<i>You have people equipped with</i>
<i>submachine guns and rifles...</i>

1485
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:53,677
<i>shooting at a first level, forcing the planes</i>
<i>to go up to a second level...</i>

1486
01:34:53,888 --> 01:34:57,881
<i>where there they come against</i>
<i>the machine guns...</i>

1487
01:34:57,992 --> 01:34:59,994
<i>a lot of them being Chinese.</i>

1488
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:02,997
<i>And then they're forced</i>
<i>up to a third level...</i>

1489
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:06,990
<i>which is that of the ordinary guns,</i>
<i>most of them, I would say, Russian.</i>

1490
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:11,227
<i>And after that they go up to a level</i>
<i>where they meet the SAMs</i>—

1491
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:16,900
<i>And I was being told that these SAMs</i>
<i>were antiquated...</i>

1492
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:20,247
<i>when in fact they are not</i>—
<i>they are formidably powerful.</i>

1493
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:23,751
<i>During one week in October...</i>

1494
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:27,744
<i>I saw at least 11 planes in five days...</i>

1495
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:32,059
<i>being shot by the North Vietnamese...</i>

1496
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:36,052
<i>antiaircraft defense.</i>

1497
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,303
<i>[Salisbury]</i>
<i>When you walk about the streets of Hanoi...</i>

1498
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:46,107
<i>you are struck by the fact</i>
<i>that you constantly see...</i>

1499
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:49,877
<i>civilians going about in trucks...</i>

1500
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:51,879
<i>with guns in their arms...</i>

1501
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:55,872
<i>or even walking down the streets</i>
<i>with guns strapped to their back.</i>

1502
01:35:56,884 --> 01:35:59,954
It's unusual to see so many people
with guns in their hands...

1503
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:02,990
and it's most unusual to see this
in a communist country.

1504
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:06,460
<i>[Todd] One evening,</i>
<i>on the road to Haiphong...</i>

1505
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:09,463
<i>we were bombed</i>
<i>300 yards from where we were.</i>

1506
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:13,234
<i>And with my interpreter</i>
<i>we immediately went onto the side road.</i>

1507
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:15,569
<i>I was very frightened.</i>
<i>I was terribly frightened.</i>

1508
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:19,562
<i>As soon as we bumped into</i>
<i>a machine gun nest, fear disappeared.</i>

1509
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:24,011
The government has understood this...

1510
01:36:24,011 --> 01:36:28,004
and I think this is one of the reasons
why it has armed most of the population.

1511
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:31,352
<i>[Berrigan]</i>
<i>We went into the countryside...</i>

1512
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:34,355
<i>and we saw great evidence</i>
<i>in the cities as well...</i>

1513
01:36:34,355 --> 01:36:36,357
<i>that the people are generally armed.</i>

1514
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:39,326
<i>The civilian militia is very large.</i>

1515
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:43,319
<i>The women share, for instance,</i>
<i>the burden of antiaircraft gunfire...</i>

1516
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,834
<i>in defense of the city.</i>

1517
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:50,070
<i>We saw large numbers of men and women</i>
<i>on the roofs ofbuildings...</i>

1518
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:54,063
<i>preparing, in the early stages</i>
<i>of air alarms, for the bombardment itself.</i>

1519
01:36:54,608 --> 01:36:58,445
<i>And they said to us quite openly</i>
<i>on several occasions...</i>

1520
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:02,438
<i>"Look, one of the most practical evidences</i>
<i>of the truth that this government speaks for us...</i>

1521
01:37:04,051 --> 01:37:06,187
<i>"is that the government has armed us...</i>

1522
01:37:06,187 --> 01:37:10,180
<i>"to the point where, if we wanted,</i>
<i>we could bring the government down in a day...</i>

1523
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:13,627
<i>and they themselves know this. "</i>

1524
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,996
<i>[Salisbury] At the time</i>
<i>that I was in North Vietnam...</i>

1525
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:19,989
<i>there obviously had not been any</i>
<i>breaking of the morale of the people...</i>

1526
01:37:20,401 --> 01:37:24,104
<i>either in the cities or, as far as I</i>
<i>could observe, out in the villages...</i>

1527
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:28,097
<i>although they had been subjected</i>
<i>to an extremely heavy bombardment.</i>

1528
01:37:28,142 --> 01:37:31,979
<i>At that time it was reaching</i>
<i>the levels of World War II...</i>

1529
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:35,249
<i>and, of course, since that time</i>
<i>has been much, much strengthened.</i>

1530
01:37:35,249 --> 01:37:38,452
<i>The people of North Vietnam</i>
<i>are young, for the most part...</i>

1531
01:37:38,452 --> 01:37:42,445
<i>and the war effort is largely</i>
<i>on the backs of teenagers...</i>

1532
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:46,660
<i>not because they're running out of manpower,</i>
<i>but because this is a young country.</i>

1533
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:49,597
There is nothing
that has not been attacked —

1534
01:37:49,597 --> 01:37:52,600
There is no threat that has not
been tried to be burned...

1535
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:55,035
or frayed or broken by us...

1536
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:58,539
and yet none of it has happened,
or it's been repaired in the night.

1537
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:01,275
Altogether,
I think one can say, objectively...

1538
01:38:01,275 --> 01:38:05,268
that there isn't a town left standing,
apart from Haiphong and Hanoi.

1539
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,983
So that there are hospitals,
there are schools.

1540
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:11,318
There is a trusted government...

1541
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:14,555
and there are —
there are political leaders...

1542
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:18,548
whom they don't hesitate
to call loved and admired.

1543
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:22,897
Which is to say,
the war's not working.

1544
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,299
It's a very simple judgment.

1545
01:38:25,299 --> 01:38:29,003
Too simple
for the complexities of our power.

1546
01:38:29,003 --> 01:38:32,996
Uh, perhaps, in a deeper spiritual sense,
too tough to face...

1547
01:38:34,174 --> 01:38:36,577
because it means the end of a giant.

1548
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:40,014
It means the last days of Superman.

1549
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:42,583
It means that for those...

1550
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:45,653
with the capacity of overkill...

1551
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:48,656
kill is not enough.

1552
01:38:48,656 --> 01:38:51,091
Um...

1553
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:54,094
the real thing required
is to live in the real world.

1554
01:38:54,094 --> 01:38:58,087
As Buber says, it is to be able to imagine
the real world and imagine human beings.

1555
01:38:58,232 --> 01:39:01,669
As long as the dinosaur couldn't do it,
he ended up on the museum shelf...

1556
01:39:01,669 --> 01:39:05,662
and as long as Superman can't do it,
he can rave and destroy...

1557
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:08,709
but he cannot give life...

1558
01:39:08,709 --> 01:39:12,702
and he cannot even truly,
as we know so bitterly, he cannot live himself.

1559
01:39:14,248 --> 01:39:16,517
<i>[Todd]</i>
<i>The North Vietnamese always insist...</i>

1560
01:39:16,517 --> 01:39:19,687
<i>that they are winning this war...</i>

1561
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:22,990
<i>that they are not simply resisting.</i>

1562
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:26,983
<i>And when I talked to</i>
<i>Prime Minister Pham Van Dong...</i>

1563
01:39:27,494 --> 01:39:31,487
<i>he said, "We are not underbombing,</i>
<i>we are facing the bombs. "</i>

1564
01:39:32,499 --> 01:39:36,492
<i>And at first I thought</i>
<i>this was mere propaganda.</i>

1565
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:40,530
But seeing the North Vietnamese fighting,
in the country and in the towns...

1566
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:43,510
I think that psychologically it is true.

1567
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:47,348
I was most interested to find
that when I got to Hanoi...

1568
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:49,984
the authorities...

1569
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:53,554
put no restrictions
on what I wanted to send out.

1570
01:39:53,554 --> 01:39:57,547
<i>Prime Minister Pham Van Dong</i>
<i>has stressed, in his talk with me...</i>

1571
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:00,394
<i>the parallel between</i>
<i>the ancient struggles...</i>

1572
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:04,387
<i>of the Vietnamese people against</i>
<i>the Chinese, the Manchus and the Mongols...</i>

1573
01:40:04,765 --> 01:40:07,768
<i>and their contemporary struggles</i>
<i>for independence...</i>

1574
01:40:07,768 --> 01:40:11,739
<i>which began, of course,</i>
<i>under the French many years ago...</i>

1575
01:40:11,739 --> 01:40:15,175
<i>were continued without interruption</i>
<i>through World War II...</i>

1576
01:40:15,175 --> 01:40:17,444
<i>then resumed again</i>
<i>against the French...</i>

1577
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:20,180
<i>and are now being carried on</i>
<i>against the Americans.</i>

1578
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:24,173
<i>Prime Minister Pham Van Dong</i>
<i>turned to me at one point and said...</i>

1579
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:28,277
<i>"Mr. Salisbury, how long do you want</i>
<i>to fight? Ten years? Twenty? Thirty?</i>

1580
01:40:28,522 --> 01:40:32,515
<i>You pick the term of years.</i>
<i>We're ready to accommodate you. "</i>

1581
01:40:32,793 --> 01:40:36,663
<i>A rather bold statement,</i>
<i>and maybe it had some bravado in it...</i>

1582
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:40,656
<i>but this is, again, in accordance</i>
<i>with the spirit of the Vietnamese people.</i>

1583
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:46,607
<i>[Berrigan] There's no one in that society</i>
<i>who doesn't remember hunger...</i>

1584
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:48,609
<i>in his own lifetime...</i>

1585
01:40:48,609 --> 01:40:52,602
<i>and it was interesting that,</i>
<i>from the peasants to the young intellectuals...</i>

1586
01:40:53,447 --> 01:40:56,050
<i>when you posed</i>
<i>the very same question</i>—

1587
01:40:56,050 --> 01:41:00,043
<i>that is, "What has the revolution</i>
<i>meant, first of all, to you?"</i>—

1588
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:02,289
<i>you'll get the same answer</i>—
<i>"We now have enough to eat."</i>

1589
01:41:02,289 --> 01:41:04,191
<i>As simple as that.</i>

1590
01:41:04,191 --> 01:41:07,795
<i>So that when the North Vietnamese government</i>
<i>makes it its pledge ofhonor...</i>

1591
01:41:07,795 --> 01:41:10,230
<i>that the rice bowl will be filled...</i>

1592
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:14,223
<i>this is so great a thing that we can hardly</i>
<i>conceive of it</i>—<i>it seems to be off our radar.</i>

1593
01:41:14,735 --> 01:41:18,728
<i>I think, you know, for them, the question is,</i>
<i>first of all, a very, very concrete one.</i>

1594
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:21,742
<i>That statement is literally true.</i>

1595
01:41:21,742 --> 01:41:25,112
<i>And then again it begins to</i>
<i>move into the larger areas.</i>

1596
01:41:25,112 --> 01:41:29,105
<i>The circumference of the bowl expands</i>
<i>and you note that the revolution has meant...</i>

1597
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,086
a passion for education...

1598
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:35,089
a passion for grass-roots involvement
in their own future...

1599
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:38,092
their own social structures,
their own politics...

1600
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:42,085
and that at the other end of that power,
which they are trying to move upward...

1601
01:41:42,129 --> 01:41:46,122
after so many, many years
of colonial powerlessness...

1602
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:50,593
at the other end of that power is standing
a man who also has a rice bowl in his hand...

1603
01:41:51,505 --> 01:41:53,507
and whose poverty is equivalent...

1604
01:41:53,507 --> 01:41:57,500
<i>whose power has not separated himself</i>
<i>from the fate of the majority...</i>

1605
01:41:58,378 --> 01:42:01,615
<i>who can move</i>
<i>in the same cheap cotton clothing...</i>

1606
01:42:01,615 --> 01:42:04,351
<i>and with dignity among them...</i>

1607
01:42:04,351 --> 01:42:08,344
<i>and whose power is not</i>
<i>an inferior backroom game...</i>

1608
01:42:08,689 --> 01:42:11,592
<i>or a game of marked cards</i>
<i>under a table...</i>

1609
01:42:11,592 --> 01:42:15,585
<i>or corrupt double-talk such as we've gotten</i>
<i>so used to in the chanceries of the West.</i>

1610
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:22,436
Yet there is one light of hope...

1611
01:42:22,436 --> 01:42:25,405
and this is that...

1612
01:42:25,405 --> 01:42:29,376
throughout Vietnamese history
they had catastrophes —

1613
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,278
<i>they had Chinese,</i>
<i>Mongolian invasions...</i>

1614
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:35,271
<i>where whole provinces</i>
<i>were destroyed.</i>

1615
01:42:35,449 --> 01:42:39,442
<i>You are not the first people</i>
<i>who destroyed villages in Vietnam...</i>

1616
01:42:39,653 --> 01:42:41,655
<i>unfortunately.</i>

1617
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:43,657
<i>And so, they are used to that...</i>

1618
01:42:43,657 --> 01:42:47,650
<i>and it's a great tradition</i>
<i>that the village is not lost...</i>

1619
01:42:47,861 --> 01:42:51,854
<i>even when it disappears</i>
<i>from the surface of the ground...</i>

1620
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:54,434
<i>because the village is down below</i>—

1621
01:42:54,434 --> 01:42:57,504
<i>down below with the tradition,</i>
<i>down below with the people...</i>

1622
01:42:57,504 --> 01:43:01,497
<i>the ancestors who have</i>
made <i>the country, literally.</i>

1623
01:43:01,608 --> 01:43:03,610
<i>The country is hand-made.</i>

1624
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:07,603
<i>There is not one square foot,</i>
