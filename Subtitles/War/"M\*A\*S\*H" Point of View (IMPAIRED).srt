- Merely curious.
- Hey. What's with Colonel Potter?

152

This is definitely not the time
to ask for a raise.

Something's gettin' to him.

Oh, yeah. Can't talk.

How 'bout mine, huh?

This hickey ain't enough to get me
into the lobby of an evac hospital.

Well, men,you played a great first half,

- Did you hear about Colonel Potter and Radar?
- No. Are they an item now?

00:11:36,054 --> 00:11:40,115
The colonel chewed him out in the Mess Tent
about the daily report or something.

175
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:42,159
Poor Radar just had to
sit there and take it.

Somebody ought to get Potter into O.R.
and remove that thorn from his paw.

You see, the technique
in giving a sponge bath...

227
00:14:28,393 --> 00:14:32,193
is never to let the ""bathe-ee'' know
that he's being bathed at all.

I'll sign it later.
Now shoo!

295
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,194
I guess it shows, huh?

296
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:36,970
It's, uh, Mildred,
my wife back home.

297
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:42,172
Lovely girl. We've been married
for 3 5 years as of last Saturday.

298
00:18:43,648 --> 00:18:46,583
Every anniversary,
no matter where I am...

299
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:48,653
I manage to call her.

300
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,950
Tell her how much I--

301
00:18:52,057 --> 00:18:54,457
Well, you know.

302
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,527
This year--

303
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,927
This year I clean forgot.

304
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:03,660
My thoughts are so filled
with this damn war...

305
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,101
I forgot her
on our most important day.

306
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:09,935
I just can't forgive myself
for missing it.

307
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:18,142
I'd like to, son. Even picked up
the phone about 20 times.

308
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:24,415
But there-- There's no excuse
for my forgetting.

309
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:27,685
- I don't know what to say to her.
- Evening, boys.

310
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,317
- Excuse me, Pierce.
- Colonel--

311
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,955
What?

312
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,466
What is it?

313
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:45,504
""Forgo''-- Oh, yeah. ""Forgot''--
What?

314
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,704
""Forgot anni''--
""Forgot anniversary.''

315

Oh, so that's what's been
getting under Dr.Jekyll's hide.

316
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:54,375
All right, Pierce.
Admit it.

317
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:58,855
You broke into my footlocker, and you read
through my personal diary, didn't you, swine?

318
00:19:58,957 --> 00:20:01,653
Charles, in all the times
I've broken into your footlocker...

319
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,921
I have never looked
at your diary.

320
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:07,089
- Then who drew all these disgusting pictures in it?
- It's dry reading.

321
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:10,224
- You need illustrations.
- I've had it with you, Pierce.

322
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:13,498
- It's two-by-fours at dawn.
- [ Gagging ]

Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, Rich.
Take it easy.

324

- [ Coughing ]
- Something's irritating his airway.

325
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:22,068
Kellye, give me
that suction here.

326
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,740
Not doing too well, huh?

327
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,679
Still not getting
any air around the tube.

328
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:34,247
- Fractured larynx?
- I don't know. It didn't show up before.

329
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,259
- We better take some more pictures, huh?
- Mmm.

330
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,261
Kellye, you want to call
for a litter?

331
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:42,197
- How are you around the larynx?
- Tricky spot. I wouldn't trust it to anyone but me.

332
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,030
We'll do it together.
And I want credit in your diary.

333
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:47,036
You still with me, kid?

334
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:48,940
Let's get him into X-ray.

335
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,844
Doctor?

336
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,080
Colonel.

337
00:20:57,182 --> 00:21:00,345
- Rich, welcome back.
- You gave us quite a scare, son.

338
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:02,443
But fortunately for you,
there was me.

339
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,045
You were on the table for two hours,
minus his curtain calls.

340
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:08,216
- How is his airway?
- So far, okay.

341
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:11,295
Rich, you had a fractured larynx.
That's what the problem was.

342
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:15,457
I'm gonna plug your tube, and I want you
to talk very quietly and carefully.

343
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:18,695
Just a few words now.
Okay, talk.

[ Weak Whisper ]
Don't know what to say.

345
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,303
- You just spoke volumes.
- Loud and clear.

346
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,707
As if there were
any doubt.

347
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:30,212
Good work, Pierce, although
you never could have done it without me.

348
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:32,875
Congratulations, kid.
You're the talk of the town.

349
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:35,179
Uh, Colonel Potter, there's a very
important phone call for you.

350
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:40,053
- Tell 'em to hold on, Radar.
- Uh, it's Mrs. Colonel Potter, Colonel.

351
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,854
- Mildred calling me?
- Uh, no, sir. You called her.

352
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:45,293
- What?
- It's okay, sir. She understands.

353
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:49,355
I explained this is the first time in a week
you had a chance to talk to her, so talk to her.

354
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:52,903
Colonel, wish her a belated
happy anniversary for all of us, okay?

355
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:57,464
I appreciate it, boys.
Remind me to make it up to everybody.

356
00:21:57,575 --> 00:22:01,568
Nope.
This I won't forget.

357
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,204
- A gold star, Radar.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:22:04,315 --> 00:22:06,647
- Hey, how's he doing?
- Better.

359
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,719
I told ya.

360
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:16,656
Rich, I want to
tell you something.

361
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:20,527
That operation we had to perform
on you was tricky, and, uh...

362
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,897
I was a little worried.

363
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:27,438
When we were carrying you
on that litter...

364
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:32,499
you-you gave me a look
of confidence, and that, uh--

365
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:34,942
I just want you to know
that helped a lot.

No unnecessary talking
