00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,800
Director: Dear chariman

2
00:00:02,815 --> 00:00:05,082
I dont care about your commitee

3
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:07,635
and its opinions about work

4
00:00:08,358 --> 00:00:11,025
have you forgotten sir we were at war

5
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:13,900
a fight with an alien race for the

6
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:16,002
very survival of our species?

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,963
I feel like I must remind you

8
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,930
that it is an undeniable

9
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:24,104
and may I say a fundamental quality

10
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:26,702
of man that when faced with extinction

11
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:29,903
every alternative is preferable

12
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:32,203
[bacground noises] over here! over!

13
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:33,836
Church: Get that door!

14
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,671
Church: What's the status up here?

15
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:40,376
Griff: Messed up, about to die.

16
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,081
Griff: Simmons is a nerd. the usual

17
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,599
Sarge: Looks like we got at least half

18
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:45,070
a dozen squads out there.

19
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:47,118
They know our position, 
and were out gunned.

20
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:48,751
Washington: So, what's the plan?

21
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:50,843
Sarge: Well, we were gunna retreat
down the hall

22
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,714
untill you just brought more
 guards that way.

23
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,233
so now, the plans pretty much

24
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,072
to go down swinging, You first.

25
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:57,123
Griff: Hey Simmons, can you get back

26
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,115
on that computer and change my

27
00:00:58,282 --> 00:00:59,882
affiliation from red, to Freelancer?

28
00:01:00,032 --> 00:01:00,465
Simmons: Traitor.

29
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:01,895
Griff: Hey, gotta go with the winner.

30
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:03,494
Caboose: umm, can you change my job title

31
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:04,934
to something more important, like astronaut?

32
00:01:05,103 --> 00:01:06,670
Oh, I know! Space Marine!

33
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:08,228
Church: What are you idiots doing?

34
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:09,825
Simmons: This computer has all of commands
 records.

35
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:12,061
Church: It does? Records on everybody?

36
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,441
Simmons: Yeah, you know, theoretically.

37
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:17,486
*singing* nothing to see here *singing*

38
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,883
Church: Oh great! now I'll show you that 
your wrong.

39
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:21,461
Wash: What an excellent idea.

40
00:01:21,676 --> 00:01:22,409
Simmons: Wrong about what?

41
00:01:22,627 --> 00:01:24,127
Church: Wash has been trying to convince me

42
00:01:24,198 --> 00:01:25,665
that i'm an A.I.

43
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:27,062
Griff: Huh? Why would he do that?

44
00:01:28,472 --> 00:01:28,672
Wash: Because he's transparent

45
00:01:28,753 --> 00:01:31,453
He can take over other people, 
you know that kind of stuff!

46
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:33,035
Griff: That's because he's a ghost dude.

47
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:34,487
Church: Thank you, thats what I said.

48
00:01:34,732 --> 00:01:37,899
Wash: If he's a ghost why aren't any of
the other soldiers turning into ghosts?

49
00:01:38,492 --> 00:01:39,825
Church: Okay, fine. Why don't we just
settle this?

50
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,550
Simmons, look me up on the database

51
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:44,442
Simmons: Yeah i'd like to help, but we may
have just kind of

52
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,736
you know deleted all that stuff of the
blues.

53
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:48,599
Wash: All of what stuff, of the blues?

54
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:50,014
Simmons: the everything stuff.

55
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:51,040
Wash: didn't I tell you not to touch
anything?

56
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,811
Simmons: Yes, but you also told us to
break stuff.

57
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:55,670
This seemed like an excellent compromise.

58
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,733
Church: Aww, thats fantastic. Now I cant
Prove him wrong

59
00:01:57,773 --> 00:02:00,773
And I dont get a paycheck. Great, 
thanks guys.

60
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:03,847
Sarge: And your side never existed, which
means red wins!

61
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:05,428
Suck it you non-existant losers!

62
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:07,156
Church: Aww, nobody cares about that.

63
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:08,246
Sarge: Sour grapes.

64
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:09,845
Griff: No way, he's not a computer.

65
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:10,821
Sarge: How can we be sure?

66
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,592
Caboose: Maybe we should ask him something
only a computer would know.

67
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:15,805
Simmons: like what?

68
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,169
Caboose: Whats nine times eight?

69
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:17,917
Reds: Seventy-two

70
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:19,584
Caboose: Oh my gosh, it's spreading.

71
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:21,536
Griff: How about this? Show me videos.

72
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:22,532
Everyone: What?

73
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,453
Griff: Thats what all my computers do.

74
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:26,614
Oh, steal some music from me.

75
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,188
or talk about politics, and bore, the
crap out of me.

76
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:32,744
Caboose: Do you have any pictures of cats
in serious situations?

77
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:34,341
Wash: Because of the truama he's been
through

78
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,711
He's not going to be able to access most
of his functions,

79
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:39,042
He may not even realize his full potential.

80
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:42,356
Sarge: Not living up to his potential?
That means Griff's a computer too.

81
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:44,969
Wash: It doesn't matter, we don't need him
to believe

82
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,965
until the next time we encounter the Meta.

83
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,976
[Loud thud]
Wash: What was that?!

84
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,776
Sarge: Cmon, do you even need to ask?

85
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:03,764
Freelancer: Primary target has arrived!
Engage! Engage!

86
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:08,802
Church: The Meta?
 How did he get inside the compound?

87
00:03:09,021 --> 00:03:12,021
Simmons: What do you mean how? It took us
ten minutes. Not that hard

88
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:13,398
Wash: Perfect.

89
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:14,356
Church: Perfect?

90
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:17,506
Wash: He's been folowing us since I found
Caboose. I knew he couldn't resist

91
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:21,144
getting his hands on all the stored Command
A.I.s. Especially Epsilon.

92
00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:22,354
Church: You knew about this?

93
00:03:22,476 --> 00:03:25,643
Wash: Knew about it? I planned on it,
Still have Epsilon?

94
00:03:25,943 --> 00:03:26,643
Church: Yeah, of course.

95
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,808
Wash: Good, lets get it to safety, then we
can finish this.

96
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,071
Once and for all.

97
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,639
Church: You know i'm starting not to
trust you.

98
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:33,847
Sarge: What do you mean starting too?

99
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:38,623
Church: What is this? The Motor Pool?

100
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:42,214
Wash: Yes. Looks like everyone is outside
fighting the Meta. still be careful

101
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:47,564
Red, you grab a vehicle. Caboose somehow I
hate to ask this, but can you drive?

102
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:50,685
Caboose: Yes. But not an automatic.
Only stick.

103
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:51,772
Wash: Why cant you drive-

104
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,300
Griff: Were in a rush, come back to
 it later.

105
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:58,145
Wash: Right, Caboose grab that car. Church,
put epsilon in Caboose's jeep.

106
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:00,009
You guys are going to make a break for it.

107
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:03,426
Take Epsilon, and turn it over to the
authorities. They'll know what to do with him.

108
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,386
Sarge: Your not comming?

109
00:04:04,386 --> 00:04:08,986
Wash: No, Church and I are staying. 
Project Freelancer had one last resort fail safe.

110
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:12,827
A high powered E.M.P. that can wipe out all
the A.I. in this facility.

111
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:15,764
Now that the Meta is here, we have a chance to
take them all out at once

112
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:17,770
and put this entire project out of 
commision.

113
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:18,786
Griff: Whats and E.M.P.?

114
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:22,868
Wash: It's an electromagnetic pulse. It wipes
out all circuitry it touches

115
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:24,149
it will destroy the A.I.-

116
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:25,801
Simmons: Ohhh. you mean an emp.

117
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,070
Sarge: Yeah, I was just about to say,
Sounds like he's talking about an Emp.

118
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,980
Wash: Emp? Thats not how you say it.

119
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,933
Sarge: Thats how most people say it. Emp.

120
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:33,921
Wash: No, they don't.

121
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:34,907
Church: I say it that way.

122
00:04:34,987 --> 00:04:39,054
Wash: It's initials for Electro magnetic Pulse.
Thats E.M.P.

123
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:41,294
Church: Right, which spells Emp. dur.

124
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:43,079
Wash: We dont have time for this 
Your wrong.

125
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,216
Simmons: Why dont we take a vote?

126
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:49,375
Wash: A vote? No, no vote. Your just wrong.
There's no vote. Its E.M.P.

127
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:51,535
Caboose: Not very Democratic.

128
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,675
Wash: Being wrong isn't a Democracy.Church
and I will work our way down to the directrors lab

129
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,943
while the rest of you escape.

130
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:58,171
Sarge: What if the Meta follow's us?

131
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:01,224
Wash: No chance, there's no way he can
pass up all the A.I. in here.

132
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:03,473
Put Epsilon in the car and lets get moving.

133
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:05,409
Church: I'm leaving. I'm going with them.

134
00:05:05,553 --> 00:05:06,053
Wash: what?

135
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:10,798
Church: I dont care about any of this.
I hate you, I hate the Freelancers,

136
00:05:11,094 --> 00:05:15,361
I hate everything about you guys. 
This isn't my fight. Its yours.

137
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,442
Wash: It's your fight more than anyone elses.

138
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:20,401
Church: I don't care what you say,
no it isn't.

139
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:23,471
Wash: Church, you'll never get another shot
at fixing all of this.

140
00:05:23,929 --> 00:05:28,296
I know you don't believe what i've told you.
You need to ask yourself: What if i'm right?

141
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:32,998
If I am, or if you have any doubt, not finding
out haunt you for the rest of your life.

142
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,372
Not just finding out about you. But finding out
about everyone, close to you as well.

143
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,103
It's your choice, what's it going to be?
