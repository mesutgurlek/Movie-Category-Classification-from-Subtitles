- [Henry VIII]:The King
of France

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,167
has demonstrated
his aggressive policies.

3
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:09,133
He has our Ambassador
murdered in cold blood.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,000
These are all
just causes for war!

5
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:15,434
- As a humanist I have
an abhorrence of war.

6
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:17,901
- As a King,
I'm forced to disagree.

7
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:21,634
Why is Henry V remembered?
Because he won the battle
of Agincourt.

8
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:24,834
That victory made him immortal.

9
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:27,701
- He has no right to any
of this. I'm a direct
descendent of Edward II.

10
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:30,834
This is my crown and my court.
Not his crown or his court.

11
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:32,467
- Treason your Grace.

12
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,467
- What if your Majesty
could gain more power

13
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,968
by peaceful means?
- Which is...?

14
00:00:37,033 --> 00:00:40,434
- Treaty of universal
and perpetual peace.

15
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,801
- The Treaty is entirely
new in the history of Europe.

16
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:45,467
- [Queen]: You have not answered
my nephew's letters.

17
00:00:45,534 --> 00:00:48,334
He advises you not to heed
everything Wolsey tells you.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,634
- You are not my Minister.

19
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:53,200
You are not my Chancellor.
But my wife.

20
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:55,734
- About the other
matter we discussed.

21
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,334
- Which other matter?

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,834
- I saved your Master's arse.
Now I want my reward.

23
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:04,801
And you can
arrange it.

24
00:01:04,868 --> 00:01:07,367
- [Queen]: I cannot give
the King a living son.

25
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,467
The King blames me,
he thinks it all my fault

26
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:11,734
and now he does not
come to my bed.

27
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:14,634
- It says if a man marries
his brother's wife
they die childless.

28
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,467
But you have a child.

29
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,300
- But not a son.

30
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:21,367
- I am with child.
tdIt is his Majesty's.

31
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:24,434
- There is to be a summit
between King Francis
and King Henry near Calais.

32
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,667
That means you will both have
the opportunity to meet
the King of England.

[Laughing]
Mary and Anne Boleyn.

34
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:32,767
- Pope Alexander
is desperately ill.

35
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,901
I can assure the support
of the French cardinals,

36
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:37,801
you will
be elected Pope.

37
00:01:37,868 --> 00:01:41,300
- It's time. My father planned
to assassinate Richard III.

38
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,067
He would come before him with a
knife secreted about his person.

39
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:46,434
Your Majesty.

the world forever.

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,434
You and I will be immortal.

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,701
bringing that eventuality
forward more quickly.

163
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:24,868
- In what way?

164
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:28,601
- By assassinating his Majesty.

165
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,100
- You did well to come to me.

166
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:39,501
But I must warn you,

167

- You see that,
brother?

171
00:15:05,734 --> 00:15:08,334
In most things,
we French excel you.

172
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,534
We have the
greatest painters,

173
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,634
the greatest musicians
and the greatest poets.

live at my court, <i>Dieu merci.</i>

The greatest

And of course,

178

we have the most
beautiful women.

You won't deny that,
will you?

Even our wrestlers
are better than yours!

- What?

183
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,300
- I said are you sure?

184
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,234
All your wrestlers
are better than mine?

Do you want to prove it?

you suggesting?

a wrestling match, brother.

the first man to throw
his opponent

to the ground
shall be declared the winner.

Are you content?
- Yes.

- Then fight on!

- What bet will you lay?
- Go, Henry.

204
00:17:17,968 --> 00:17:20,734
- 2 Kings, 2 Queens and a Fool.
- Who's the Fool?

205
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,968
- I don't know yet,
but it's a full house.

- Come on, your Majesty!

he's not gonna win.

I want a re-match!!

Are you afraid?
Are you afraid of a re-match?

215
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,133
- Are you calling me afraid? Of
what am I supposed to be afraid?

216
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,501
- Of me!
- Let's have it then...

the treaty!

that the King of England is
easily changeable, shallow,

of keeping his word

I will go tell them.

a lot about you.

You've been at the French
court for 2 years.

his wealth extraordinary.

You will make arrangements
to visit him at Aachen.

It may suit us better to do

business with him,
than with the French.

- What did you thinks|
of that performance?

- I...
- Don't be stupid!

261
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,968
You're not stupid. The King's
performance! At the summit!

262
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:34,167
How did it strike you?

263
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:37,100
- Personally, I would have
wished to seen a greater

264
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:40,801
more powerful man upon
the throne of England.

265
00:25:40,868 --> 00:25:44,400
Someone whose very presence
would have made the French
sit up and come to heel.

266
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:47,767
- I have the way
and the means

267
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,100
to crush the usurper
of my throne

268
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:52,367
as one would crush
a revolting spider.

269
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:54,667
I will
make him wish

270
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:57,000
that he had entered the Church
after all and left the affairs

271

of the state to those
who are born to rule!

If you betray
me Boleyn,

00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,667
I'll feed
your body to my dogs.

- Now...

275
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,300
What have you
discovered here?

276
00:26:21,367 --> 00:26:26,434
- I have it on
good authority...

277
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:31,000
that the Duke of Buckingham
is raising an army.

278
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:33,801
He says it's
to protect him while
he tours his Welsh estates

279
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:35,767
where he's not popular.

280
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:40,834
He's also been borrowing
large sums of money.

281
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,601
- Buckingham.

282
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:55,634
Invite him to court,
for the New Year.

283
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:58,501
But don't say anything
to alarm him.

How are your children?

- They're well,
thank you, your Majesty.

287
00:27:21,434 --> 00:27:23,501
I encourage them all
at their studies.

288
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:27,167
Even the girls.
- Always the idealist.

289
00:27:27,234 --> 00:27:31,300
- At some point,
I imagine,

290
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:34,234
it will be considered
ordinary enough,

291
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,167
and nothing strange
for a girl to be educated.

292
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:40,501
- I've received a gift.
From the Duke of Urbino.

293
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:43,334
It's a book called
 <i>The Prince,</i> by a Florentine,
Niccolo Machiavelli.

294
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,534
- Yes I know it.

295
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:48,934
It's about
political opportunity.
[Chuckling]

296
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
- It's true...

297
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:55,100
It's not like your book, <i>Utopia.</i>

298
00:27:55,167 --> 00:27:58,601
It's less... utopian.

299
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:05,901
Nevertheless he asks
an important question

300
00:28:05,968 --> 00:28:08,434
whether it is better for a King
to be feared...

301
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:10,501
Or loved.

302
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,901
Buckingham is going
to try and kill me.

303

[Crackling fire]

304
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:39,901
- Your Eminence.

305
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,300
- Lady Blount.

306
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:48,200
You are full term?
- In a little while.

307
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:50,901
- Are you well?

308
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:54,334
- As can be expected.

309
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,701
Have you some message
from his Majesty?

310
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:59,200
- No. None.

311
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:01,200
But from your husband.

312
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:04,100
- My husband?

313
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:07,100
- Yes, I have spoken
to him.

314
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:09,834
He finds that he is...

315
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,501
Reconciled to your condition.

316
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:14,434
- Then he won't send me
to a nunnery?

317
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:17,334
- He will be
made an Earl

318
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
and be given estates.

319
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:24,901
- And my child?

320
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:27,033
- That is for the King to decide

321
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,033
whether he will
recognize the child.

322
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,367
I'm afraid I can offer you
no more comfort than that.

323
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,968
- Will you tell the King
of my love for him?

***

325
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:09,267
- My Lord, I hereby pledge
my allegiance to you
and your house

326
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:13,167
and do swear to serve you,
even unto death.

327
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:16,167
- We thank you from
the bottom of our heart.

328
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:19,734
And in due course, you will find
your loyalties richly

329
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:22,934
and properly rewarded.

330
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:34,567
- I thought
I should tell you.

331
00:30:34,634 --> 00:30:38,367
I am being sent to meet
the new Holy Roman Emperor.

332
00:30:38,434 --> 00:30:43,701
The King has asked me
to draw up a new treaty,

333
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,501
uniting us
against the French.

334
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:49,033
- You must be
very disappointed.

335
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,834
- I am very realistic.

336
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:56,434
- Then I am disappointed.

337
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:59,400
- Our dreams were
very unrealistic.

338
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,767
- Maybe so.

339
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:05,167
But I will continue
to dream them,

340
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:07,300
even if I am alone in doing so.

341
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:20,033
I fear his
Majesty no longer...

342

Trusts or cares for me
as he once did.

343
00:31:22,701 --> 00:31:27,767
- Thomas, let me give
you a little advice.

344
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:30,033
If you want to keep
the love of a Prince,

345
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,000
this is what you must do:
you must be prepared

346
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:36,667
to give him the thing you most
care for in all the world.

347
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:44,067
- The thing I care for most
is my integrity.

What is it you care for most in
the world, your Eminence?

against his Majesty's servants

in pursuit of their duties,
that is treason too, as
your Grace should know.

You don't know anything.

If I'm accused of treason,

I should be judged
by a jury of my peers,

not by the dogs of butchers.

to judge
Buckingham's case.

20 peers will be

Norfolk will be
first among them.

- What?

404
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:41,701
- I believe
it could be dangerous

405
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:44,300
to find the Duke
guilty of treason.

406
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:47,834
- Even if he is?
- Even if he is.

407
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:52,501
On the other hand,
he could be found guilty
of some lesser offence,

heavily fined

little cause or occasion
to rise against you.

- And that would be
the best outcome?

- I believe it would, yes.

414
00:37:11,734 --> 00:37:17,167
- And you would see to it that
the court came to that decision?

- I have every confidence.

when you approach him...

427

- Your Grace.

- Only to pass on
his Majesty's love.

He appreciates
the role you will play at

He was executed by his Majesty's
father, did you know that?

you might like to wear it.

Is this your son?

received by his godfather.

for his inheritance.

It would be terrible, for
example, if some action of yours

441

were to deprive him
of a father, a title and a ring.

Your Grace.

to recognize his son.

He will be known for
the present as Henry Fitzroy.

He will have his own

with Wolsey?

- In return for England not

I promised him
the French vote.

has gone to Aachen to
meet the new Emperor.

How to play

There's something deep
and dangerous in you, Anne.

- And in return for
our alliance?

593

of King Francis.
