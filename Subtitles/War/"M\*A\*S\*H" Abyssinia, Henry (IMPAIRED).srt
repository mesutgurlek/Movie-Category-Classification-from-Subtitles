1
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:51,493
<i>[Hawkeye] All right, give me a clamp.</i>

2
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:55,234
<i>[Operating Room Chatter]</i>

3
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:02,246
Hey, Hawk, what's this one?

4
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:06,809
## [Humming]

5
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,145
- "Avalon."
- Wrong.

6
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:12,919
- "In a Little Spanish Town."
- Right.

7
00:01:12,992 --> 00:01:17,190
- Please, I'm right in the middle of a stomach.
- Try this one.

8
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:20,061
## [Humming]

9
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:26,829
- "On Wisconsin."
- No. That was "O Shepherd, Guide Thy Flock."

10
00:01:26,906 --> 00:01:29,932
Oh, I should've guessed that.
I've danced to that 1,000 times.

11
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:32,000
Shut up, will ya? Shut up! Shut up!

12
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,445
You shut up, Frank!
Everybody in this madhouse, shut up.

13
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:39,451
We're a little late, folks. So good night
from <i>Name That Tune.</i> Clamp.

14
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:44,589
- Colonel?
- Yo?

15
00:01:44,657 --> 00:01:46,818
Do you know what I found
in this morning's mail?

16
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:49,885
Uh, now that's a tough one.
Hum a few bars, will you, Radar?

17
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:52,227
[Chuckles] You're going home.

18
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,062
I'm going home?

19
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:57,432
You got all your points.
They're discharging you.

20
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:00,700
- Discharged?
- To Tokyo, San Francisco, then home.

21
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:04,504
I'm going home. I'm discharged.

22
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:06,306
I'm going... I'm going home.

23
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,644
- Henry, that's terrific.
- Henry, congratulations. That's terrific.

24
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:12,742
- That's wonderful, sir.
- [All Congratulating]

25
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,778
All together now.
# O, shepherd #

26
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:22,556
[All] # Guard Wisconsin
Fight right through that line #

27
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:26,963
I'm going home.
I can't believe it. I'm going home.

28
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:30,025
Wow.

29
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:34,096
- [Exhales] Oh boy, that's a "burny."
- [Laughs]

30
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:36,141
- You sure you don't want a drink, Radar?
- No, sir.

31
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,769
It makes my eyes turn red,
and I fall down.

32
00:02:38,845 --> 00:02:42,337
- It's kind of nice to lie down with red eyes.
- Yeah.

33
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:44,747
Ooh, you wanted to make
that phone call to your wife.

34
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:47,251
Oh, right, right.

35
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,483
Now, let's see, Radar.
We're a day ahead plus 14 hours, right?

36
00:02:50,556 --> 00:02:53,457
No, sir. The States
are a day ahead plus 14 hours.

37
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,858
- Well, then, it's yesterday in Bloomington?
- Yes, sir.

38
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:57,862
Well, then, I should have
called her yesterday.

39
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,091
Well, you didn't even
know about it then.

40
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,498
Why can't everybody
be on the same time?

41
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:05,059
Because the Earth is round,
keeps rotating all the time.

42
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:07,129
Oh. I thought it was just an army thing.

43
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:11,540
Let's see, Bloomington.
It's 1:00 Wednesday afternoon right now, sir.

44
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,739
- 1:00? Lorraine's not home.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:16,805
Maybe she just went
to the store or something.

46
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:21,217
No, no. Every Wednesday she gets together
with Ella, Bea, Marie and Olive.

47
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:24,450
They go out Route 26
to the Old Red Barn for lunch.

48
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:26,549
They have two daiquiri's,
a watercress sandwich...

49
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:30,562
and then Olive tells
all about her hysterectomy.

50
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,428
- Every Wednesday, sir?
- It's a club.

51
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:35,831
Well, how long do they usually stay?

52
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:40,066
Oh, a couple hours. Then they kill an hour
on the way back feeling yarn at the knit shop.

53
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,472
Well then, why don't you call Mrs. Blake
around 4:00 in the afternoon?

54
00:03:43,543 --> 00:03:48,537
Well, no. Olive usually gets carsick.
Better make it 4:30.

55
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:50,605
Uh, just to be on the safe side,
we'll make it 5:00.

56
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:55,177
No. Andrew has a trombone lesson at 5:00.
He's learning to play Ravel's <i>Bolero.</i>

57
00:03:55,254 --> 00:03:57,415
- I won't be able to hear a thing.
- 5:30?

58
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,085
- 5:30. 5:30.
- Okay. 5:30.

59
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,154
Radar, Lorraine and the kids
are going to die.

60
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,930
You know, the first night I'm home...

61
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,028
after we, uh, put the kiddos to bed?

62
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:17,736
Lorraine and I
are going upstairs to our room.

63
00:04:19,412 --> 00:04:25,078
That woman has the most fantastic body
in downstate Illinois.

64
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:28,814
Thirty-six, twenty-four, thirty-four.

65
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:31,322
With skin like alabaster:

66
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,383
Clear, soft, smooth and warm.

67
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:38,794
And she wears those
little, short, flimsy nighties.

68
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:45,904
I think I will have that drink, sir.

69
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:50,135
Finally. Finally, you're going
to command this outfit.

70
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:52,143
Everything's happening so fast.

71
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:56,875
Discipline. Adherence to regulations.
A taut ship.

72
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,281
I love tautness.

73
00:04:59,352 --> 00:05:03,254
- To command is your destiny.
- [Giggles]

74
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:07,224
Oh, I can feel the power
surging through your veins.

75
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:11,286
- Am I really surging?
- Oh, Frank, you'll be magnificent.

76
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:14,356
I just wish I'd taken
R.O.T.C. In school.

77
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:17,493
- I wasted so much time in the stamp club.
- I thought you were President?

78
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,403
Well, that wasn't leadership.
They needed someone to lick the stamps...

79
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:22,634
and I had the biggest tongue.

80
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,700
- Frank, do you doubt your ability?
- Mmm.

81
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:29,612
Do you want to see how sure
I am of your ability?

82
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:33,243
Well, all great men have their doubts.
They say going up San Juan Hill...

83
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,514
Teddy Roosevelt was worried sick
about breaking his glasses.

84
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,579
Look, darling.

85
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:42,659
I've been saving it for you.

86
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:45,458
Well, I haven't been
promoted yet, Margaret.

87
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:48,557
Out goes Major Burns.

88
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:52,001
In comes Colonel Burns.

89
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:56,834
- [Excited Laughter] Yes?
- Margaret?

90
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,434
I think I'm surging.

91
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,015
Lorraine, is that you? It's me.

92
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:06,449
I got good news, honey.
I'm coming home.

93
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,513
Honest. For good. Yeah, the orders
just came through this morning.

94
00:06:11,591 --> 00:06:15,493
I oughta be coming through
the front door in about three days.

95
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:20,328
Honey... aw, please don't do that.
Honey, please.

96
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,630
- She crying?
- No, she wants to re-cover the furniture.

97
00:06:25,104 --> 00:06:27,038
Honey, I just wanna see you and the kids.

98
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:30,598
I don't care what the furniture
looks like, except for the bed.

99
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:36,747
- Now she's crying.
- Sir, there's a time limit on the call.

100
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:40,912
Honey, now just take it easy, okay?
Good.

101
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:45,151
Are the kids home?
She is? Well, put her on.

102
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:50,222
Janie-poo? It's Daddy.

103
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:54,096
Num-num-num-num-num.
I'm eating you up.

104
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,158
- Sir, there isn't too much time.
- Leave him alone. He's eating.

105
00:06:57,236 --> 00:07:00,797
Janie, honey, would you get Mommy
back on the phone?

106
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:04,536
Oh, and, uh, tell Andy
to stop playing Ravel's <i>Bolero.</i>

107
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,216
Lorraine, honey, listen.
Now, there's a lot of things you have to do.

108
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:14,276
Well, like, uh... My-My suits.

109
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:16,685
See, I've lost a lot of weight over here.

110
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:21,216
I mean, I'm uh, I'm a 34-waist now.
You won't know me stripped.

111
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:23,285
Wear your dog tags.

112
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:27,025
Honey, the brown double-breasted.
It might fit now.

113
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,465
So just take it to the cleaners.

114
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,905
Uh... She... Honey, I don't want
your mother wearing my suits.

115
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:39,671
She what? Well, that's dumb.

116
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:42,805
She went to a party
dressed as Conrad Nagel.

117
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:46,374
- That's it, sir.
- Honey, I gotta go.

118
00:07:46,452 --> 00:07:49,285
Now, Lorraine, don't tell anybody.

119
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:51,721
We'll just walk into
the country club Saturday night...

120
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:54,624
start dancing and let 'em all cheer.

121
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:59,529
Lorraine? Lorraine? We got cut off.

122
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:05,400
[Exhales]
Sweet Lorraine.

123
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:09,430
[Whispering]
She has a fantastic body.

124
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:23,144
Okay, Radar. Everything
in these boxes is to be shipped.

125
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:25,209
- My uniforms go in the bag.
- Check.

126
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,278
Check-a-roony in a banana-ka.

127
00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:31,591
Is there one or two "Js"
in "fragile," sir?

128
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,823
Uh, one will do it, Radar.

129
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:38,229
- There it is.
- You find something, sir?

130
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,963
Yeah, that jar of mayonnaise
we lost last Fourth ofJuly.

131
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:44,972
Hey, you better write a letter of apology
to that navy chaplain.

132
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,532
I thought he copped it.
[Whistles] Boy, that's a greeny.

133
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:55,741
Oh... Hey, hey, hey.

134
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:57,842
There's a picture of you and me, Radar.

135
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:03,482
Oh. Oh, that's right after
you took out my appendix.

136
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:06,049
Mmm. You were one sick kid.

137
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,460
You know, I looked for that thing
till 4:00 in the morning.

138
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,694
- It was behind your secum.
- I didn't put it there on purpose, sir.

139
00:09:16,705 --> 00:09:19,868
- You saved my life.
- Ah, my pleasure, Radar.

140
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:24,038
- <i>Um, sir?</i>
- Yo?

141
00:09:24,112 --> 00:09:26,171
There's something I'd like to tell you.

142
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:29,513
Well, now, you've got
exactly 34 hours to tell me.

143
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:34,078
Yeah. Well, uh...

144
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,886
I just wanted to say
that I'm really gonna miss you.

145
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,952
Um, you know, my own father
didn't have me until he was 63.

146
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,023
And, uh, first time we played peek-a-boo
together, he had a stroke.

147
00:09:49,237 --> 00:09:53,071
Look, uh, Radar, don't get gushy, okay?
You know how I am.

148
