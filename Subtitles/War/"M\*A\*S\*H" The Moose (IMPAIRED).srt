Deliveries in the rear.

We overran a North Korean aid station.
We got some of ours and some of theirs.

00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:48,816
- You seem to be picking at your food.
- Just cautious.

147
00:08:48,883 --> 00:08:52,546
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm. Radar, you're a remarkable person.

148
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,680
Naive, yet wise.
Gentle, but strong.

149
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:58,988
No more nurses' shower pictures.
My camera's rusty.

150
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,692
Don't be so suspicious.
I just wanna ask you a question.

151
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:04,259
Oh, no. Here it comes.

152
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:08,264
Suppose there was a doctor
who wanted to join this outfit.

153
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:11,699
Oh, heck. That's easy.
All he'd have to do is, uh...

154
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:13,930
get in touch with "l" Corps
and request a transfer.

155
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:16,939
Problem. This doctor
is from the other side.

156
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,669
- Other side of what?
- Other side of the war.

157
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:24,203
- You mean he's from Supply?
- No, Radar. He's North Korean.

158
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:28,012
[High-Pitched Laugh]
You guys are kidding, right?

159
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:36,453
Hey, that's a real problem.
"I" Corps disapproves of the enemy.

160
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:39,121
It's not impossible, is it? I mean,
you've got low friends in high places.

161
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:41,187
- Be persuasive.
- Be charming.

162
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:43,961
- Use force.
- No. I couldn't do that.

163
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:50,273
Beej, the, uh, the nurses' annual
physical is coming up soon, isn't it?

164
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:53,799
- Mm-hmm, and we're gonna
need an assistant.
- Oh, yeah.

165
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:56,675
Is that the, uh, complete physical,
same as last year?

166
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:59,181
- <i>[Hawkeye] It's better.</i>
- Mmm.

167
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:04,119
We're gonna need a set of orders,
I.D., dog tags and a uniform.

168
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:07,555
With all that stuff, you could transfer
Flash Gordon to the outfit.

169
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:10,889
- We don't want him. Bleaches his hair.
- Listen, um...

170
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:13,589
Sparky could really help us on this,
but he's gonna want something.

171
00:10:13,664 --> 00:10:16,258
- Something really good.
- We already anticipated that.

172
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,767
How would Sparky
like a solid gold Chinese watch...

173
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:21,202
taken directly from the wrist
of an enemy officer?

174
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:23,296
- With his permission, may I add.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

175
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:27,674
It's very nice, but he'd never be able to read
the time. It's got Chinese numbers on it.

176
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:30,509
- It comes with an instruction book.
- The symbol at the top is a 12.

177
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:32,572
The one at the bottom is a six.

178
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:37,609
- They stole that from us.
- We stole waffles from them.

179
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:41,180
- I thought that was "psgetti."
- Come on. Come on. Will Sparky do it?

180
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:46,457
Well, uh, for this watch, I think he
would probably transfer his own mother.

181
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,658
Have a safe journey.
Good luck and God be with you.

182
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,724
- Thank you.
- Aw, knock it off and get on the bus.

183
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,793
Frank has trouble
saying good-bye.

184
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:56,499
- You better move along
if you want a window seat.
- Yes.

185
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:04,846
Brokenhearted, Pierce, about losing
your good North Korean buddy?

186
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,281
No. I was getting
kinda tired of the guy.

187
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:10,115
He beat me out of eight bucks
in Chinese checkers.

188
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:12,917
<i>[Frank] Let's bring these men</i>
<i>up here and get 'em loaded.</i>

189
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,049
- <i>Come on.</i>
- [Engine Starts]

190
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:26,359
[Blows]

191
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:37,044
"Captain Cho Wunho,
board certified, Chicago, 1949."

192
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,844
- Welcome aboard, Captain.
- Thank you, Colonel.

193
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:44,411
Radar, this is the first time "l" Corps has
sent us help without us screaming about it.

194
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:46,820
Oh, yes, sir. That's right.
You know how it is.

195
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,826
Sometimes when you don't yell and holler
the loudest, they hear you the most.

196
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:54,853
Well put. Can you find quarters
for the new doctor, Radar?

197
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:57,662
Um, your permission
to move him into the Swamp, sir?

198
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:00,328
Oh. Okay.

199
00:12:00,404 --> 00:12:02,395
But prepare yourself, Captain.

200
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:05,033
At first, your roommates
may appear a bit crazy.

201
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,906
But later on, you'll find out
they're only lunatics.

202
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,344
I'm accustomed to living
with Americans, Colonel.

203
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:12,641
Colonel? Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.

204
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:15,378
<i>No. Come in, Major.</i>
<i>I'd like you to meet our new doctor.</i>

205
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:18,012
- Oh.
- <i>Major Houlihan, Captain Cho Wunho.</i>

206
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:22,718
- Haven't we met before?
- I was thinking the same thing.

207
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:25,956
There's a little gin mill
in Seoul... the Pink Pagoda.

208
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:28,293
- Didn't we tango?
- Certainly not.

209
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:30,356
I mean, I've never been there.

210
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:33,232
- I must be mistaken.
- Perhaps I am also.

211
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:36,101
Uh, why don't you take the doctor
to his quarters, Radar.

212
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:39,040
Oh, right away, sir. Sir.

213
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:42,442
<i>Oh, Captain?</i>
<i>You'll go on duty at 1800 hours.</i>

214
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,880
Will somebody please call me?
I recently lost my watch.

215
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:48,850
Uh, that will be no problem, sir.
I'll-I'll call you.

216
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,279
I swear I know that man,
and I don't tango.

217
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,383
Maybe it was the cha-cha-cha.

218
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,852
I'm kidding.

219
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:09,897
- <i>[Hawkeye] You wanna sponge that, Frank?</i>
- <i>[Frank] Okay, okay!</i>

220
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,679
Why do we need another doctor
all of a sudden?

221
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:19,978
We've been short a doctor here
since the day you showed up.

222
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,041
I'm as good a doctor
as the next man.

223
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:24,451
Provided the next man
is Lou Costello.

224
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,124
You know, Major Houlihan and I think
there's something fishy about this Dr. Cho.

225
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:32,718
You'd think there was something fishy
about Albert Schweitzer.

226
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:35,629
There is. If he were a good doctor, he'd
be in Beverly Hills helping the wealthy.

227
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:37,860
<i>[Hawkeye]</i>
<i>Sponges, please. More sponges.</i>

228
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:39,903
<i>Frank, I can't see.</i>
<i>You're standing in my light.</i>

229
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,268
[Whispering] Colonel, do you
wanna take a look at what he's doing?

230
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:44,466
<i>Frank, come on, will you!</i>

231
00:13:49,413 --> 00:13:51,404
Clamp.

232
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,117
I've never seen a heminephrectomy
done like that, Doctor.

233
00:13:56,186 --> 00:13:59,349
- Where'd you pick that up?
- Professor Goodson in Chicago, sir.

234
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,755
<i>[Potter]</i>
<i>Ah. Read about it. Never seen it.</i>

235
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:04,089
Beautiful work.

236
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:07,619
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Mmm. Well, carry on.

237
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,861
<i>Halt!</i>

238
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:21,367
What's your business, gentlemen?

239
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,903
- You are a nurse?
- <i>No. I'm Corporal Klinger.</i>

240
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:28,349
I don't like to brag, but I made
this outfit myself. What do you think?

241
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:30,545
Most becoming.

242
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:33,522
We are from the KATUSA hospital
at Kumgang.

243
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,616
You have these supplies?

244
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:39,924
"Plasma, penicillin,
morphine, achromycin."

245
00:14:39,997 --> 00:14:41,988
Sounds like you're
opening a drugstore.

246
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,329
- What's goin' on here, Klinger?
- Oh, Major Burns, sir...

247
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:46,369
these men are from
the hospital at Kumgang.

248
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,597
- They need supplies.
- Forget it.

249
00:14:48,672 --> 00:14:50,936
We're not here to hand out supplies
to every Tom, Dick and Kwang.

250
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:55,069
- I'll check with Colonel Potter.
- Don't bother Potter. I can
say no all by myself. No!

251
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,875
But we must have these supplies.

252
00:14:57,948 --> 00:15:02,146
Pardon me, Major,
but what is your name, please?

253
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:04,084
Frank Burns.
What's it to you?

254
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:08,558
We have heard of a great doctor
called Frank Burns.

255
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,719
- Could you be him?
- Of course.

256
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:15,060
We have heard that
he never turns down people in need...

257
00:15:15,132 --> 00:15:18,067
that he is as generous
as he is skilled.

258
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:22,538
Yeah, well, I'm, uh, sort of the
Albert Schweitzer of Korea, you know.

259
00:15:22,606 --> 00:15:24,733
What an honor it is to meet you.

260
00:15:24,808 --> 00:15:27,572
Oh. Well, what are you guys
standing around for?

261
00:15:27,644 --> 00:15:30,579
- Get these people what
they need and hurry up.
- Right away, sir!

262
00:15:39,556 --> 00:15:42,957
Excuse me.
You're getting supplies for those men?

263
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,154
- Yes, sir. It's Major Burns's orders, sir.
- They are imposters, you know?

264
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,356
What? Who, sir?

265
00:15:48,432 --> 00:15:51,458
The men in the jeep. It is
common practice to change uniforms...

266
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,901
and get supplies
from the units like these.

267
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,734
- You mean they're the enemy?
- Yes. Be careful of them.

268
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:59,537
- Hey, I gotta tell Colonel Potter.
- No.

269
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:02,100
They are desperate
and heavily armed.

270
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:05,842
- W-Well, what should we do?
- The easiest way is to
give them what they want.

271
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,907
Then they will go, peacefully.

272
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,217
- Promise me something, Radar.
- Yeah?

273
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:17,783
If anything happens,
bury me in the blue chiffon.

274
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,322
You sure you fellas
won't come in for a cup of coffee?

275
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,491
There might even be some pudding
left over from lunch.

276
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:27,128
- I don't think so.
- It's rice pudding. You guys
are supposed to like that.

277
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:31,664
No. No. We have no time.
We must get supplies and leave.

278
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:35,575
Uh, stay a while. I could tell you about
my work with, uh, arterial transplants.

279
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:40,275
- Some other time.
- Hey, I just had a wild thought.

280
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:43,945
How would it be if I came back
with you guys to your hospital...

281
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,011
give all your staff
a chance to meet me?

282
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,614
We could get everybody together,
and I could give them a talk. Huh?

283
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,683
N-No. We must leave quickly.

284
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:54,060
You know, perhaps the major
has a good idea.

285
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:57,328
Yes. I think
he would be quite useful.

286
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,300
I'd have to be back
in a couple of hours.

287
00:16:59,369 --> 00:17:02,133
<i>That is no problem.</i>
<i>The hospital is close by.</i>

288
00:17:02,205 --> 00:17:04,696
- Great.
- Uh, wait a minute. Major, where you goin'?

289
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,141
I'm going with these boys back
to meet everyone at their hospital.

290
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:09,201
- Should be a real treat for 'em.
- You can't do that, Major!

- What would we do without you?
- What are you talking about? I'm off duty.

293
00:17:14,551 --> 00:17:16,542
Well, sir, who's gonna help us
plan the dance tonight?

294
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,589
- Ah! The dance.
- What dance? Nobody told me
about any dance.

295
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:21,817
- Let's all go to the colonel's
office and discuss it, sir.
- The colonel's office.

296
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:24,861
Let go, and that's an order!
These boys are in a big hurry.

297
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:26,919
That is true.
We must go now.

298
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:30,592
Major, what about the class
this afternoon? You know, on
how to recognize the <i>enemy.</i>

299
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,658
You had all that
in basic training.

300
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:34,761
If you can't recognize the enemy by now,
you're in a lot of trouble.

[Chuckling]
All set. Let's go!

Break a leg.

303
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,938
I've seen the man work.
He's a qualified surgeon.

304
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:48,883
He gives me the creeps.
He's always watching everything.

305
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:51,512
Last night, I came out of the shower,
and, sure enough, there he was.

306
00:17:51,588 --> 00:17:54,318
That is suspicious.
Last night was supposed to be my night.

307
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:57,155
- Colonel?
- What do you want me to do?

308
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:59,661
Just check up on him.
That's all I ask.

309
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:03,460
Colonel Potter! Sir? Major Burns
just drove off with two men in a jeep.

310
00:18:03,533 --> 00:18:05,485
They were bad men, sir.
I think they were the enemy.

311
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,176
What men? What jeep?
What enemy?

312
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,916
These two guys come in asking for supplies,
so we give them what they want.

313
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,254
And then Major Burns gets in the jeep
with them and goes off.

314
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,886
- Why? Did they force him?
- No, ma'am. I think he wanted to go.

315
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,193
Radar, get on the phone, call
the M.P. S, alert them about that jeep.

316
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,665
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute. Radar?

317
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:25,295
- How do you know those men
were enemy soldiers?
- Captain Cho told us.

318
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,363
- Captain Cho? How did he know?
- I don't know. He just knew.

319
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,436
- Well, isn't that interesting?
- Hmm.

320
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,084
- Oh, what is it now?
- Sir.

321
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,617
- I.D.'s, please.
- Why are you stopping us? Been a slow day?

to break up the monotony?

We have important business
to attend to.

324
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:57,232
Sorry, sir, but there have been some
infiltrators coming down to get supplies.

325
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,363
Oh, these men are not infiltrators.
One good look should tell you that.

I can vouch for these men personally.

Let's go.

333
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:26,758
I should have done something
to save Major Burns, but I was afraid.

334
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:31,361
If those men had recognized me,
they would have panicked.

335

- Look, you did what you could.
- Yeah. Look at the bright side...
maybe they'll keep him.

Ah, Colonel Potter.
What a surprise.

- The new drapes are due Friday.

put you under arrest.

perfectly good doctor on a technicality?

344
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,968
"Technicality"?
This man's the enemy.

345

you were trying to do...

348
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,880

the grand piano, it wasn't a bad idea.

would be interested in an exchange?

No, they'd never go for that.
