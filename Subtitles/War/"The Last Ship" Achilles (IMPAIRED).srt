were going to do this.

166
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:41,569
We got on that ship, and suddenly

167
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,069
they started killing
everyone for no reason.

168
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,562
Commander's brother... he started it.

169
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:49,463
Way I saw it, <i>you</i>
were shooting at my men.

170
00:07:49,487 --> 00:07:50,962
[Scoffs]

171
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:54,679
They would have killed me if I hadn't, sir.

172
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:58,762
<i>Dios mío,</i> this is an insane world.

173
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:02,062
I thought I was joining with
this group for my own security,

174
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:04,762
not to kill innocent civilians.

175
00:08:04,787 --> 00:08:05,843
Trust me.

176
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,788
- Where's the sub now? Where'd he go?
- I don't...

177
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:08,650
Is he looking for us?

178
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:12,866
I think you would... you
would know better than me, sir.

179
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:19,288
- Wait, wait, wait.
- [Chair thuds]

180
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:22,014
I am sorry for what I did.

181
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,173
I would understand if you
killed me right now, but...

182

[Coughs]

183
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,541
If you would give me the chance,

184
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:35,647
sir, I feel much happier
here with you and your crew

185
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:39,107
than with this lunatic criminal.

186
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:43,106
I ask you now for political asylum.

187
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:46,106
I will give you anything
you need that could help you,

188
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:48,831
any information, I-I promise.

189
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,322
Chandler: You believe him?

190
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:52,934
What he's been saying squares with

191
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,567
what Burk and Green saw
aboard <i>Solace,</i>

192
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:55,848
and what I saw from the bridge wing,

193
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:57,129
but I just want more on that sub.

194
00:08:57,154 --> 00:09:00,395
And we got our second
string A.S.W. Evaluator.

195
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:02,418
- Mason can handle it.
- Oh.

196
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:05,432
He knows the equipment. He
just doesn't have the hours.

197
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:08,558
Jenkins spent his entire career
training for that one job.

198
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,672
It was all he did all day long.

199
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:11,723
Mason: All stations,

200

[Paper rustles]

Sir, I'm hearing something now.

204
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,663
It appears to be on the
edge of the convergence zone,

205
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:24,715
but every couple minutes
I hear the faintest... Hum.

206
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,086
What's the bearing?

207
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:28,442
I believe it's between

208
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,841
2-3-0 and 2-3-5 relative, sir.

209
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:32,532
Is it the sub?

210
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:36,541
I don't know, sir, but
it's running very quiet.

211
00:09:36,566 --> 00:09:38,666
Well, anything that
quiet has gotta be a sub.

212
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:41,792
I agree, sir, but something this quiet...

213
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:44,348
It... it must be a type 2-1-4.

214
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,082
Juan Carlos said it was
an <i>Astute</i> class.

215
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:47,698
I suppose that that's possible, sir,

216
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:49,323
If it were fitted with
the new sound matting.

217
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:51,375
That would make it <i>Ajax</i>
or <i>Achilles,</i>sir.

218
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,614
<i>Ajax</i> was still being fitted.

219
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,309
Then it's <i>Achilles,</i>sir.

220
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:57,413
Where's it headed?

221
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:01,183
I'm sorry, sir, I can't
tell. It's just too far out.

- Commander.
- Sean: What is it?

225
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:16,356
It's, uh, a ship traveling south.

226
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:19,578
Pitifully slow. 12
knots. It's not very big.

227
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:22,675
Could be a-a freighter or a small tanker.

228
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,614
It's underpowered. You
could barely hear its engine.

- Are you having me on?
- No.

230

Ain't no freighters doing
business during an apocalypse.

231
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:30,589
That ship ain't going slow
'cause it's underpowered.

232
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,352
It's going slow so's to be quiet.

233

I think I'm getting some kick

244

from her prop off the sea bottom.

245
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:05,857
How shallow?

246
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,049
A guess, sir.

247
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:11,330
I-I'd say 400 feet or less.

Anybody else out there?

maybe 8, 10 miles south.

Porpoises, maybe. Probably dolphins.

the bearing 2-3-5 out,

where does it get that shallow?

Uh, North end of the Bahama Bank,

That fit with what you're getting?

256
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:30,142
Yes, sir. That would put
them roughly 50 miles out,

00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,712
and based on, uh, how much
louder they're getting, sir,

I'd say they're heading... 0-7-5.

Sir, if he's an <i>Astute</i>
class, he's carrying a Spearfish,

Not if he wants the cure.

We don't want anything from him.

We could fire first once we're in range.

What do you mean? For the cure.
Are they gonna offer us a deal?

No, no. They thought the
cure was on <i>Solace.</i>

When... when we didn't find
it, the commander's brother,

he became certain that
the cure was just a rumor.

As far as they know, this is
just a floating warship, sir.

close enough to hit you.

May I make one request, please?

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,963
I speak to you as one sailor to another.

I am a man of honor.

If they engage you, if
they want to sink you...

and they most certainly will... [Coughs]

I don't wanna drown like
this, handcuffed to a bed.

I swear to you,

333
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,486
I won't jeopardize the safety of your ship.

334
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:28,585
Take me outside.

Above decks, please.

00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:34,592
I will tell you everything I know

about every single member of that crew.

they're well within

Their bridge to bridge. Morse code, even.

They're gonna try to sink us.

We go to quiet two.

Even at dead slow,

00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,976
we may lose them just long
enough to get behind the shoal.

If he chases us in the blind,

348

we send our helo, drop a few
torpedoes down their throats.

349
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,978
Yeah, if he knows we've
slowed, he might just fire.

350
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,087
At 4 knots, we'll have almost
no maneuverability to evade.

You got a better move?

Yeah, we fire first, take
our chances at a dogfight.

You'd bet on me.

Against a sub with Spearfish?

there! Silent ship! Gone!

Well, the hospital ship was
the right place, as I thought.

It's not, in fact, because

Quite the opposite.

803
00:41:14,481 --> 00:41:17,756
