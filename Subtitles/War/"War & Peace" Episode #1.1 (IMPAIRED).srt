can you be so calm?

This monster, Bonaparte, he's
crossed into Austria now,

and who's to say that
Russia won't be next?

No, no, no. Our illustrious
Emperor has it all in hand.

I do beg your pardon. I'm so sorry.

Who is that young man? I'm
sure I didn't invite him.

Ah. My young relative, I regret to say.

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,559
Count Bezukhov's son. His
natural son, of course.

21

Did he have any other kind?

Petersburg.

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,279
Well, please don't bring him again.
He looks like a wild animal,

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,732
so unlike your own lovely children.

You know, I've never
asked you for anything.

36
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:53,519
I've never reminded you of
what my father did for you,

37
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,968
but now, I beg you, for my boy, Boris,

38
00:02:57,554 --> 00:03:00,142
a word from you to the
sovereign would be enough.

39
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,201
I'll do what I can.

40
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:05,353
What is it you wish for the
boy, Anna Mikhailovna?

41
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:08,913
Get him a commission in the Guards
and recommend him to the General.

42
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:10,685
You know a word from you would do it.

43
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,482
You know, my influence is nothing
like what you imagine...

44
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,889
but I am seeing the sovereign
later this evening.

45
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,412
Oh, thank you, thank you!

46
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,841
I know I can trust you.

47
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,489
And when you come into your
inheritance, you will remember

48
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,449
Count Bezukhov promised a regular
allowance for my poor boy?

49
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,888
I know nothing of that.

50
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,000
And don't you think you've had
enough from the Bezukhov family?

51
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,110
Go and beg elsewhere.

52
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:50,089
Napoleon has utterly
destroyed his own country.

53
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,489
No, no, that's not right!

54
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,525
France is no longer a place where
civilised people can live.

Oui, oui, c'est vrai, c'est
vrai, malheuresement.

- I say Napoleon is a great man, sir!
- Outrageous!

57
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,109
You think so, monsieur?

58
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,663
- Shall we go to that table over there?
- No, no, I must say this.

59
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:06,743
Yes, of course Napoleon's a great man!

60
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:10,031
He stood above the revolution,
he put an end to its abuses

61
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:11,711
and kept all that was good about it!

62

You see good in revolution, sir?

freedom of speech,

liberty, equality, fraternity,

65
00:04:18,472 --> 00:04:21,191
these are ideas we could
learn from in Russia.

66

of overfed aristocrats

who have even forgotten how
to speak their own language!

00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:31,832
By God, we could do
with a revolution here!

- Andrei!

74
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,980
Yes. Making a fool of myself, as usual.

dear Anna Pavlovna.

Goodnight, goodnight.

79
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:08,312
Having fun?

80
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:12,261
Listen, come round for a drink
tonight, we'll make a night of it.

81
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:22,112
She's ravishing.

82
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:25,751
No hope for me, though.

83
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:28,712
I see her every day and she
hardly notices I'm there.

84
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:32,974
But your lovely wife? Is she well?

85
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:34,866
See for yourself.

86
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:37,191
She's enchanting.

87
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:40,049
A woman like that spreads
happiness wherever she goes.

88
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:42,165
You're a lucky dog, Andrei!

89
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:43,962
You think?

90
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:50,791
Has he told you?

91
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:53,311
He's going off to the war and
sending me away to the country

92
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,071
to have my baby all alone.

93
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:57,671
That's the sort of husband I've got!
Are you really?

94
00:05:57,672 --> 00:06:00,031
She won't be alone, she'll be
with my father and sister.

95
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:03,591
But to have my baby in that bleak
place, with people I hardly know.

96
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:06,115
Lise, we have been through all
this, you know it's for the best.

97
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:09,151
Now, take the carriage home. The
doctor said you should rest.

98
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:12,380
I'll walk with Pierre. You see?
He treats me like a child.

99
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:12,687
Lise...

100
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:15,791
No. I don't care if
Monsieur Pierre hears it!

101
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,192
You have no pity for me. You
were never like this before.

102
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:24,432
You see?

103
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:27,951
I don't believe he loves me any more!

104
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:30,151
Dear Princess, please don't be upset.

105
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:32,551
I understand how you feel.
Although, how could I?

106
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:35,393
Not being a... But... Life is very...

107
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:38,671
No, this is all wrong. This is
none of my business. I should go.

108
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:41,551
- I should leave you...
- No, no, no, don't. I'll be good.

109
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:43,552
I know Andrei wants to talk to you.

110
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:50,432
- You won't be too long?
- No, my love.

111
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:53,752
Goodnight, Pierre.

112
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:07,391
You're really going to the war?

113
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:10,191
You don't think Napoleon's the
Antichrist, like the rest of them?

114
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:12,471
- It's got nothing to do with Napoleon.
- Then why?

115
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:13,920
Because I can't bear
any more of this life!

116
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:18,232
Drawing rooms, gossip, balls,
vanity, night after night.

117
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:21,521
Don't look at me like
that, it's the truth.

118
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,551
Never marry, Pierre.
Don't make my mistake.

119
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:27,071
But Lise's not like that. She's
the gentlest, sweetest...

120
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,511
Oh, I know, I know.

121
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:30,711
She's a wonderful woman
and I love her dearly,

122
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:32,952
but I can't breathe here, Pierre.

123
00:07:34,472 --> 00:07:37,111
I might as well get myself
killed fighting Napoleon.

124
00:07:37,112 --> 00:07:40,431
But you're the most brilliant man I know.
You could do anything.

you're going to do yet?

Can you imagine? I still don't know.

129
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:51,791
But I do think I could
make something of my life,

130
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,711
do something extraordinary, even.

131
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:55,380
Lead the revolution, perhaps?

132
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:57,991

But yes, no, you're right. I've
been thinking that myself,

00:08:14,752 --> 00:08:17,328
I should stop going round there.
I will stop.

Our duty, my dear, is to
correct the Count's mistake.

We can't let him die,

nearest and dearest, can we?

He wouldn't want that.

326
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,129
In any case, he surely has
forgotten about it by now

327
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,689
and he'd want that false
will to be destroyed.

- Destroyed?
- Yes, destroyed.

The Count still lives.

But, really, what were you thinking of?

- I have a perfect right to be here.

You know very well the
Count is my near relation

to be here at this sad time.

- Very ill.

After this last stroke, he's not
expected to last the night.

Well, perhaps later.
He is sleeping now.

been given extreme unction?

00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,569
You had no need to tell me that.

472
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,130
Yes, well, we've said our goodbyes.
Off with you.

473
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:04,548
Off with you, I say!

474
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,689
What is it? What's wrong?

475
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,969
Nothing's wrong. It's just his way.
You know what he's like.

476
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,530
Andrei, one thing, before you go...

477
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,009
I know... I know you don't believe

478
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,050
but, for my sake, will you wear it?

479
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,196
Father's father wore it
all through the wars

480
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,249
and it'll help me not to worry too
much, if I know you were wearing it.

481
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,450
Please, Andrei...

482
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,610
..for me.

483
00:34:51,728 --> 00:34:53,168
Well, for you.

484
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,290
Thank you.

485
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,489
(LISE SOBS IN THE NEXT ROOM)

486
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,282
I'd better say my farewell to her.

487
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,849
Be kind to her, Andrei.

488

- Why would I be anything else?
- (SHE SIGHS)

489
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,169
Andrei, if you had faith, you
would have turned to God

490
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,329
and asked him for the
love you don't feel.

491
00:35:16,354 --> 00:35:18,234
Yes, if only it were that simple.

492
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,889
Already?

493
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,530
Can't be helped, I'm afraid.

494
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,889
Stay, please.

495
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,969
No!

496
00:35:51,994 --> 00:35:54,739
No! No, please, no!

497

(LISE WEEPS)

498
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,250
Take care of her.

499
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,049
Oh, Nikolai.

500
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,449
Be careful, my dear.

501
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,929
Don't put yourself in any danger!

502
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,410
Mama, please don't fuss. I am a man now...
so is Boris.

503
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,849
Don't they look fine in their uniforms?

504
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,289
I can't bear to look for fear of
thinking what may happen to them.

505
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,450
Don't say that. They'll come
home safe, I'm sure of it.

506
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,929
I wish I could come with you.

507
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,049
I'd chop old Bonaparte down, like this!

508
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,289
I bet you would!

509
00:36:49,314 --> 00:36:51,633
- Will we ever see our boy again?
- There, there, my dear.

510
00:36:51,634 --> 00:36:54,569
- War is a terrible thing!
- What has to be must be...

511
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,009
and boys will be boys.

512
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,569
I'm going to make you
proud of me, Papa.

513
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:01,341
I know you will, my son. I know.

514
00:37:41,194 --> 00:37:42,554
Let's go.

515
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,090
Bye!

516
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:13,462
They've marched a thousand miles,
but are in excellent shape.

517
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,169
You issued my order? Yes, your Grace.

518
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,889
We march tomorrow to join with
General Mack's army at Ulm.

519
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,798
And that's where we'll stop
Napoleon in his tracks...

520
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,770
God willing.

521
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:29,449
General Mack and the Austrian army
will be defending this approach.

522
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:32,769
We will attack the French
from the East, here.

523
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,769
I tell you, I must see the General!

524
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,065
- I tell you, he is busy! I insist...
- Go and see what that row is about.

525
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:41,505
As soon as he is available, I
will let him know you are here.

526
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:44,249
Until then, you will have to wait.
I must see General Kutuzov.

527
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,361
As soon as he is available, I...

528
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,009
What is it? You may give
your message to me.

529
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,690
With respect, are you General Kutuzov?

530
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:56,006
I am Kutuzov.

531
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:04,329
Your Grace, you see before you
the unfortunate General Mack.

532
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,729
What are you doing here? We
were to join forces at Ulm.

533
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:12,089
Napoleon outflanked us. We
suffered terrible losses.

534
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:14,809
I was obliged to offer
him our surrender.

535
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,130
What?

536
00:39:20,616 --> 00:39:21,976
The whole army?

537
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:25,325
70,000 men?

538
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,330
With regret, your Grace.

539
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,369
Might I ask, sir, what
are we going to do now?

540
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,530
A good question.

541
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,329
We will retreat, of course.

542
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,209
Is that really all we can do, sir?

543
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,969
Our reinforcements are on their way.

544
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,049
We will retreat until we
can join up with them

545
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,283
and the other Austrian divisions.

546
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,569
This has been a bad set-back,

547
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,010
but the way to survive
it is to be prudent.

548
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,250
They call me the general who
doesn't like to fight...

549
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:10,455
..but only a fool would sacrifice
good men for a bit of glory.

550
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,489
So, what's the matter
with you, young Rostov?

551
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,929
Nothing at all, Captain,

552
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,531
except retreat isn't
what I went to war for.

553
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:24,097
I know.

554
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,198
You want to put that fine young horse
of yours through his paces, eh?

555
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:30,305
Well, you'll get your
chance, by and by,

556
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,910
and you may not care
for it when you do.

557
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,849
- What's it like, Denisov?
- What's what like?

558
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,009
Actually, you know, being in combat.

559
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,730
Bloody awful, if you're
on the losing side.

560
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,089
But seriously, it's one of those
things no-one can tell you about.

561
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,080
You have to experience it for yourself,

562
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,369
like being with a woman
for the first time.

563
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,409
Can be wonderful. Can be terrifying.

564
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,850
(DENISOV CHUCKLES) You'll find out.

565
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,861
No word from Nikki yet.

566
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,529
Do you think they've
forgotten all about us?

567
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,244
I wouldn't be surprised if they had.

568
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,849
It's all right for them,
they get to do things.

569
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:14,315
We just have to sit about and wait.

570
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,540
But to think of Nikolai in
danger, I can't bear it.

571
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,489
He used to cry when he fell
over and hurt his knee,

572
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,369
and now he has to face bullets...

573
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,690
Don't.

574
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,791
Do you think about him all the time?

575
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:31,799
Of course I do.

576
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,947
Do you remember him really well?

577
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,489
Remember exactly how he looks
and everything he said to you?

578
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,610
- Yes, of course.
- I do too, Nikolai, I mean.

579
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,929
When I think of Boris, I can't
really remember him at all,

580
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,969
even though he kissed me.

581
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:52,736
I try to remember him, but
somehow his face doesn't come.

582
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,518
No, nothing.

583
00:41:56,908 --> 00:41:58,929
Isn't that terrible?

584
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,049
That's because you
don't really love him,

585
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:03,369
not in the way I love Nikolai.

586
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:06,089
I just know that I'll
always love Nikolai.

587
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,649
Whatever happens to him,
whatever happens to me,

588
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:10,729
whether he loves me or not,

589
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,393
I shall be in love
with him all my life.

590
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,533
Will you write to him and tell
him how much you love him?

591
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,026
He knows.

592
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,596
- Will you write to Boris?
- No.

593
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,649
No, I'd be ashamed to.

594
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:25,449
Ashamed? Why?

595
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,850
I don't know, it would
just feel awkward. False.

596
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,649
That's because you really love
that funny one with the glasses!

597
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,609
Pierre?

598
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,969
I do not!

599
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:41,650
- Where did you get that from?
- Seeing you dance with him.

600
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,050
What strange ideas you have.

601
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,849
I just can't get used
to the idea of it,

602
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:52,849
that, suddenly, I own so much.

603
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,129
All these houses, all these estates,

604
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,809
so much land, plantations, forests...

605
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,889
Surely it's wrong that one
man should own so much?

606
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:05,289
Well, you know, Count Bezukhov,

607
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,009
the saying is that we don't
own our earthly possessions,

608
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,289
we merely curate them for our
heirs, for the generations to come.

609
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,769
Looked at that way, it's
an honour and a duty.

610
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,969
Yes, but I'd like to share this wealth,

611
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,969
not simply hoard it for my children.

612
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,169
I want to change the
way things are run,

613
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:25,929
not that I've any experience
managing anything,

614
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:30,329
but I want to do something
useful, something good.

615
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,649
You have a noble heart, Count,

616
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,250
but I'd advise you not
to rush into things.

617
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:40,370
It'd be my privilege to look after
all those business matters for you.

618
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:46,050
Your priority now must be to
ensure your own happiness.

619
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,930
How?

620
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,130
(DOOR OPENS)

621
00:43:58,410 --> 00:43:59,530
Oh, it's you.

622
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:02,489
What a lazy sister I have.

623
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,210
I was out riding at dawn.

624
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,409
Get out, you smell all horsey.

625
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:11,529
Mmm, what lovely smooth skin.

626
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:14,050
- Stop that, Anatole.

not.

and he worships you.

642

656
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,889
how very good of you to come
along to my little salon,

657
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,009
when you must still be feeling so
acutely the death of your poor father.

658
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,049
Well, yes, but I hardly knew him.

659
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,249
Mostly, I feel embarrassed
by my good luck

660
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,318
in inheriting such a great fortune,
I've done nothing to deserve it.

661
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,945
Ah, now, Count. There
you are, too modest.

662
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,969
The very fact that your father
singled you out for greatness

663
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,849
shows that you must have
exceptional qualities,

664
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,609
which I discovered for
myself long since.

665
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:09,169
Really? I had no idea.

666
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,929
And Prince Vassily is advising you?

667
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:14,329
Yes, yes, he's been very kind.

668
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:15,889
You couldn't do better.

669
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,689
May I ask, what has been his advice?

670
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,849
Well, he thinks I should get married.

671
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:24,769
And so you should, a man
in your exalted position.

672
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,049
The Prince is absolutely right!

knack of talking to them.

676

Believe me, my dear Count,

677
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:38,809
it is not for you to concern yourself.

678
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:43,049
It is for the young ladies to make
themselves pleasing to you now,

679
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,569
rather than the other way round,

680

wrong thing and upset people.
