- Yes, yes, of course I am.

Oh,

I had no idea, Pierre. I've never
experienced anything like it before.

Like what, exactly?

I'm in love, my friend!

Yes. Yes, with Natasha Rostova, yes?

Yes, who else? I feel like I've
never been properly alive before.

I feel I can't live without her,
Pierre!

00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,510
But could she love me?
Might she think I'm too old.
