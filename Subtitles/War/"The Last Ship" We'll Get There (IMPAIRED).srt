Things go that way sometimes.

Yes, sir, I will. You can count on me.

for deployment gifts.

Not as good as a warm body in your bed,

8
00:00:21,358 --> 00:00:24,026
but it'll just have to
do till I see you again.

[Sprinkler hissing]

Darien, I'm not going to the med.

00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:31,934
Navy's sending us to the Arctic.

13
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,670
The Arctic? That's crazy.

14
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,706
Some cold weather test
on a new weapons system.

It's all classified.
It's happening very fast.

No e-mails, no calls.

18
00:00:43,413 --> 00:00:44,914
For how long?

19
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:48,084
Six months, maybe five.

20
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:50,753
- Figures.
- It's my last tour for a while.

21
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:52,822
Then I'll be around the house so much,

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,157
you'll be sick of me, I promise.

I did.

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,737
It's from the championship game.

27

Keep it next to your bed.

- It's not regulation,

so I know you can't wear it.

33
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:30,293
How about I keep it in the front pocket

It's a lot of static.

Yeah, whatever you might hear out there

50

is not gonna be particularly uplifting.

51
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:20,343
Well, my dad had an old ham radio

52

set in his cabin,

53
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:24,914
and I thought maybe if Darien was...

54
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,351
It's our anniversary.

Well...

Before we left, things were
pretty ragged between us.

after we lifted EMCOM,
she... told me about Lucas.

Losing a son is one thing,

64
00:02:57,047 --> 00:03:01,283
but dealing with it on your own is just...

There was nothing you could do.

166
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:00,382
and that's just the way you like it.

167
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,684
Quincy, what are you talking about?

168
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:04,019
I know that you're in pain
here, but there's nothing...

169
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:06,121
I told you we should share our information,

170
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:08,691
that sneaking off to the Arctic
wasn't the way to do this,

171
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:11,060
but you loved the whole "top secret" thing.

172
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:13,629
That's not fair, because
we both agreed...

173
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:14,797
This was the only way we
knew what we were doing.

174
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:16,732
Quincy, where is this coming from?

175
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:19,101
This plague is the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

176
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:21,503
Rachel Scott saves the day.

177
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:24,406
- This is not my fault.
- No, it's mine...

178
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:28,444
For following you.

179
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:33,349
I mean, what were you risking, really?

180
00:08:33,383 --> 00:08:36,518
You've got no family.
You've got no friends.

181
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:40,322
Truth is, you don't have
any skin in the game.

182
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,427
You have no idea what I have lost.

183
00:08:45,462 --> 00:08:47,596
The guy who pops into town
for a twice-monthly screw

184
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,164
doesn't count.

185
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:52,468
[Scoffs] You don't know about loss

186
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:54,470
because you don't care
about anyone but yourself.

187
00:08:54,537 --> 00:08:56,805
Where the hell do you
get off thinking your pain

188
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,640
is any greater than anyone else's?

189
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:01,243
There's a whole ship
full of people out there

190
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:02,845
who've lost just as much as you,

191
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,614
and yet they keep finding
a way to march on, but you...

192
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:10,319
You're a coward.

193
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:13,255
Nothing more.

194
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:15,491
Probably a great deal less.

195
00:09:17,494 --> 00:09:19,495
[Huffs]

196
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:23,599
Diplomacy's not necessarily
your strong suit.

197
00:09:23,633 --> 00:09:25,200
I can't even look at him.

198
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,736
Well, you said you can't do it without him,

199
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:29,304
so one way or another,

200
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,806
we're gonna have to
get him on board, right?

201
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,375
You do it. You talk to him.

202
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,278
I'm not that good with people anyw...

203
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:37,813
[Electricity crackles, power surging]

204
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:39,815
What on earth is that?

205
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,284
[Equipment beeping]
Bridge, this is M.P.A.

206
00:09:42,318 --> 00:09:43,886
We've got high temperature
on number 1 and 2 generators.

207
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,522
Commencing stage one load-shed.

208
00:09:46,556 --> 00:09:49,858
I just lost surface search radar.

209
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:52,161
[Electronic whir, power surges down]

210
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,762
[Door creaks]

211
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:55,798
Tell Captain Chandler
that we need A/C and power,

212
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:58,233
or everything will be lost, and hurry!

213
00:09:58,268 --> 00:10:00,702
- Right away.
- [Under breath] Damn it.

214
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:02,771
No, that's not it. Trace the line.

215
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,440
We can't run at this temperature.

216
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:06,208
We're gonna overheat!

217
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:07,743
Pull the filters. Let's see
what's going on in there.

218
00:10:09,212 --> 00:10:10,412
[Explosion] Whoa!

219
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:12,781
- Damn it!
- We got a fire!

220
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:15,951
- Okay! Okay, I'll call the bridge!
- [Alarm sounding]

221
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:17,619
[Bell clanging] Fire, fire, fire.

222
00:10:17,654 --> 00:10:19,488
Class Bravo fire, main engine room two.

223
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:22,458
Away the at-sea fire party,
provide from repair five.

224
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:25,160
D.C.A., it's the captain.
What's the status?

225
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:27,529
I say again, D.C.A., what is the status?

226
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:33,183
[Coughing]

227
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:35,419
[Alarm sounding]

228
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:38,522
Mr. Chung! Everybody okay?

229
00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:41,158
- Yes, sir. The fire's out.
- What's our sitrep?

230
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:44,127
It started in the seawater
service system intake, sir.

231
00:10:44,162 --> 00:10:46,196
Something must have torn off the filters,

232
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:47,998
and sea life bloom got in...

233
00:10:48,032 --> 00:10:50,200
That's on me. We cut it a little
tight getting out of Gitmo.

234
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:53,270
Corals must have knocked off
the filters. How bad is it?

235
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:56,139
It's too soon to tell, sir,
but with the intakes down,

236
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:59,443
we've lost our ability to cool
the engine oil for the mains.

237
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:02,279
What about the generators?
Did they survive?

238
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:03,814
Just generator three, sir,

239
00:11:03,882 --> 00:11:06,083
and we're lucky it was
offline during the time.

240
00:11:06,117 --> 00:11:09,086
I want all the electricity
diverted to the C.I.C.

241
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,854
And Dr. Scott's lab.

242
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,457
Under any circumstance,
she needs that room cooled.

243
00:11:13,491 --> 00:11:16,426
- Do you understand?
- Aye, sir. Sorry, sir.

244
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:17,961
Don't be sorry.

245
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:20,197
Let's just get it fixed. Yes, sir.

246
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,469
[Clank, power surges on]

247
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:30,140
[Sighs] Thank you. Thank you.

248
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:34,044
- Captain's on the bridge.
- Report, sir.

249
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,081
R.O. system's down for now.
Let's initiate conservation.

250
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:40,450
Salt water shaving only, no showers.

251
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,353
Water strictly used for
cooking and drinking.

252
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:45,422
[Sighs] It's gonna be 100 degrees today.

253
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,958
I'd like to reduce Manning
at all watch stations

254
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:49,759
and suspend all non-essential activities.

255
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:53,297
Good. Meanwhile, I've got
other fish for you to fry.

256
00:11:53,331 --> 00:11:55,098
[Tears paper]

257
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:03,407
Good. I didn't wake ya. [Sniffs]

258
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:04,841
[Sighs]

259
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:06,476
A hot one, huh?

260
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:10,247
Reminds me of August in Chicago.

261
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:13,383
That's where I'm from. You know that?

262
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:18,288
Yeah, I was a cop. Homicide.

263
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:22,593
South side. I was good at it, too.

264
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,428
[Mouth full] You mind if I smoke?

265
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:25,662
Please don't.

266
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:27,598
Mm. Mmh-mmh.

267
00:12:27,632 --> 00:12:29,299
[Lighter clicks]

268
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,567
[Exhales]

269
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,139
[Exhales deeply] You
ever hear of Keelhauling?

270
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:37,541
Can't say that I have, no.

271
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:38,976
Really?

272
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,613
See, back in the mid
1800s when a sea Captain

273
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:46,450
encountered a particularly
problematic sailor,

274
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:48,185
he'd have him bound with rope,

275
00:12:48,252 --> 00:12:49,953
thrown over the side of the ship,

276
00:12:49,988 --> 00:12:53,023
dragged underneath the hull.

277
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:56,360
Poor bastard would bounce
and scrape along the keel,

278
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:57,661
barnacles and such.

279
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:00,530
But when he'd come up on the other side,

280
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:04,034
if he wasn't drowned or decapitated...

281
00:13:04,068 --> 00:13:07,437
He tended to be a lot more cooperative.

282
00:13:10,074 --> 00:13:12,409
Keelhauling. [Sniffs]

283
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:17,247
Just off the top of my
head, I can think of about

284
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:19,182
200 sailors on board this ship

285
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:21,418
who'd like to try that out on you.

286
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:24,287
Captain Chandler would
never allow such a thing.

287
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:27,124
Hmm, maybe.

288
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:28,525
Maybe not.

289
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,429
Personally, I never found
torture that effective

290
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,364
in my line of work. I told
you I was a cop, right?

291
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,700
- You did, yes.
- Yeah.

292
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:38,568
See, I always found that

293
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:41,271
if you just laid out the facts for a guy,

294
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:43,006
treated him with a little respect,

295
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,243
maybe give him a chance to redeem himself,

296
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:49,613
earn somethin' back...

297
00:13:49,681 --> 00:13:51,548
He'd make the right choice.

298
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,383
You can't force me back into the lab.

299
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:54,651
I won't do it.

300
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:57,220
Well, suit yourself. [Exhales]

301
00:13:57,255 --> 00:14:01,191
But remember, we got a hard
and fast rule on this ship.

302
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:05,128
[Sighs] Anything that
doesn't serve a purpose is gone.

303
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:09,032
Ain't no fat on the bone here.

304
00:14:09,067 --> 00:14:11,334
[Sniffs] Hope you can hold your breath.

305
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,303
I want sunlight.

306
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:20,377
And someone to play chess with.

307
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:22,646
Someone good.

308
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,250
Did you reset the
electronic governor controls?

309
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:29,386
Cycled them three times.
They're completely wiped.

310
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,421
[Sighs] Did you try to
rig casualty power cables

311
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:32,523
from main one?

312
00:14:32,591 --> 00:14:34,558
There's no way to do it. The
main cable riser's melted.

313
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,661
Mr. Chung, you qualified E.O.O.W. faster

314
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:39,262
than anyone I've ever seen,

315
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,031
and you could rebuild
most of this power plant

316
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:42,666
with your eyes closed.

317
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,434
You're going to handle this.

318
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:46,603
[Sighs]

319
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:50,273
[Door creaks open]

320
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:02,119
[Door closes]

321
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,557
I'm guessing the gene sequencing

322
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:09,426
showed a high degree of variation.

323
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,827
You're having trouble distinguishing

324
00:15:10,862 --> 00:15:12,529
what's causing the enhanced pathogenesis

325
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:14,498
and what's just background noise.

326
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:19,369
Right you are... As usual.

327
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:23,273
Let's get to it, shall we?

328
00:15:25,743 --> 00:15:28,245
It's gonna take a week,

329
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,280
maybe 10 days at all stop

330
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:32,783
- to repair the engine damage, sir.
- A week?

331
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,651
We can run one of the
four turbines on manual,

332
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:36,486
but... the seawater system's fried,

333
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,188
so we... we can't cool the engines.

334
00:15:38,256 --> 00:15:39,656
And how long can we
run without overheating?

335
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,258
Maybe an hour, but then another five

336
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,559
to let it cool down,

337
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:44,494
but I'll have to wash down the engines

338
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,163
before we can even try that.

339
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:48,064
So what's the issue? Something
with the R.O. systems?

340
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:49,866
The circuit breakers in the load centers...

341
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:50,801
They're completely burnt out.

342
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,303
We can't make fresh drinking water.

343
00:15:53,337 --> 00:15:54,771
And how long to fix that?

344
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:57,440
Also a week, sir. And
that's the real problem.

345
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:59,309
The entire time we were in Gitmo,

346
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:01,278
we weren't filtering water from the harbor

347
00:16:01,312 --> 00:16:03,747
because we didn't know if it
was contaminated by the virus.

348
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:06,383
[Sighs] So we're down to...

349
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,553
What, 3,000 gallons of fresh water?

350
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:14,858
- Just about, sir.
- [Sighs]

351
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,227
- Slattery: Costa Rica will have to wait.
- Agreed.

352
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:20,730
We'll have to dead-stick until
we get that one engine on line.

353
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:23,500
We got an hour every six to
make as much distance as we can

354
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:26,269
to find the safest place to
make port and get fresh water.

355
00:16:26,304 --> 00:16:29,439
I'm recommending we head
here... Serrana Bank.

356
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:30,607
It's uninhabited, which means

357
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:32,242
it should be untouched by the virus,

358
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:34,177
and it gets over a hundred
inches of rain per year.

359
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:35,412
We can anchor there

360
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,380
until the engineers get us back on line.

361
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:40,817
E.T.A.? Given our current
limitations with engine output?

362
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:44,354
Taking into account
projected winds and current...

363
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:46,289
Six, six and a half days.

364
00:16:46,324 --> 00:16:48,325
They've gotta be someplace else.

365
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,593
The area has been
pretty well-charted, sir.

366
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:51,561
Maybe we can find an abandoned ship

367
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:54,231
with a fresh water supply.
All right, send the U.A.V.

00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:42,905
there's no way that you
can move the ship forward

She's right. We'll be stuck in place

until we get the engines repaired,

486
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:49,345
and we're already running
out of drinking water.

If we can figure out a
way to spin the propellers,

488
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:52,848
we can generate enough electricity

489
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,250
to cool the lab, correct?

00:23:54,284 --> 00:23:56,351
Yes, sir, but how can
we spin the propellers

491
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:58,287

- Rig the case now.

Due respect, Captain, we only
have a small window of time

496
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:19,308
to make it to the island
on the water we have.

But these past weeks,
