1
00:00:00,693 --> 00:00:01,897
Oh well would you look at this.

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:04,251
Oh Archie don't, leave it.

3
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:06,068
LORNA: I have two sons overseas.

4
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,754
They're alive !!

5
00:00:07,754 --> 00:00:08,888
Well Yeah.

6
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,297
Girls these days haven't figured beauty's
in what a woman hides.

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,609
Witham foods has unparallelled food supply contacts.

8
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:18,426
Together we'll make millions.

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,676
Last night was the best of my life.

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,426
Marry me Gladys, the woman that I can cling to
while I'm over there.

11
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:27,592
Unless you're in a uniform nobody sees you
as a man, they think I'm a coward.

12
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:29,926
An affair with Hazel somehow
proves that you're not.

13
00:00:29,926 --> 00:00:31,860
What if I were the one that strayed, what
would you do ?

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,109
Don't make me answer that.

15
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,491
I thought Lewis had forgotten all about
me look at this.

16
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:42,032
Thirteen letters, a bakers dozen.

17
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:44,194
When a soldiers mail comes it comes in spurts.

18
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:45,906
Betty !!

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,782
The censors are so heavy handed.

20
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,706
I thought you were engaged to a rich
American.

21
00:00:50,706 --> 00:00:52,593
Well now she's engaged twice.

22
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:54,048
Is he romancing you ?

23
00:00:54,048 --> 00:00:56,157
Truth be told it's mostly about food.

24
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,456
"There's not much beef to be had in the
market and eggs are a dollar a dozen"

25
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:02,423
Boy the guy oooozes charm.

26
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:05,329
How am I to write him back if I want to
stay true to James ?

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,844
You should have thought of that before you
gave him my address.

28
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:13,300
" I dream of holding you in my arms to
once again kiss your ............... "

29
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:19,430
Oh my, soldiers don't write me letters like that.

30
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,681
It's your day off Lorna, have some fun.

31
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:29,580
You can't be here I have neighbours, thin walls !!

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,222
And what'll they say huh ?

33
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:35,179
What'll they say about a poor Pusan who's bringing
fresh Pomadories from his victory garden ?

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,080
My husband could come home
from the Legion any minute.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,504
Well then we'll make him an Egg Plant Parmigiana.

36
00:01:38,504 --> 00:01:40,081
No we won't make him anything.

37
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,385
You gotta take these, their from my best batch.

38
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:44,614
Marco, what happened the other
night, that was a mistake.

39
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:45,709
I'm married.

40
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,786
If I thought it wasn't written
in your body I wouldn't be here.

41
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,332
Oh you don't make this easy.

42
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,210
Then I'm doin' it right.

43
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:05,553
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR.

44
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:08,745
My God, stay here.

45
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,645
Thank you for the delivery.

46
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:31,162
Military telegram.

47
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:37,037
Hey don't worry about it, there's plenty
of reasons for them to send a cable.

48
00:02:37,037 --> 00:02:39,162
Must be about my boys.

49
00:02:40,554 --> 00:02:42,225
- Here
- No !!

50
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:48,162
I have to wait for Bob,
this is for him and me.

51
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:53,259
You need to go.

52
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:55,600
You shouldn't be alone Lorna.

53
00:02:56,289 --> 00:03:00,463
Please Marco, this has nothing to do with you.

54
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:03,214
Please.

55
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:31,255
This family understands soldiers Major,

56
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:34,068
unlike another grocery firm
which shall go unmentioned.

57
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,339
I'll mention it "Steinem"

58
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:40,261
Game face Gladys, the army just sprung the news,

59
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:42,887
their awarding the rations
contract in the next 48 hours,

60
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:44,761
it's down to us and the Steinems.

61
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:48,325
I'll take it, I'll take it.

62
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:50,559
Those are the rations James
and daddy manufactured ?

63
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,981
Indeed.

64
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,699
Swanky.

65
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:55,499
Your father thinks the product
speaks for itself but

66
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:59,150
until the ink is dry
presentation is everything.

67
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:02,308
Give them a big smile Mrs. Witham.

68
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,713
I'd show them some leg if I thought it would help.

69
00:04:05,782 --> 00:04:08,688
Your fathers playing up his time in
the great war for all it's worth.

70
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:11,012
I think he had a rather cushy
time of it to tell the truth.

71
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:13,514
According to him he defeated
the Huns single handedly.

72
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,247
The naybobs here are lapping it up.

73
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:18,625
So he's paving his way with lies.

74
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:22,848
Gladys, we need this win, this
contract will set us up for life.

75
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,248
Come James, the Colonel seems to think
your the brains of the outfit.

76
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:27,828
Oh he is father.

77
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:30,974
You too Glady, I told them
about your war effort as well.

78
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,749
Even if you're only sorting
files in a munitions factory.

79
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,732
Only.

80
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:39,686
Now there's the fire we need.

81
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:55,429
Gin ....... I'll take those.

82
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:58,454
No need for coppers where I'm Goin'.

83
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,642
You're gettin' outa here in a coupla days.

84
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:04,765
I not gonna live like this, Archie,

85
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:07,501
not out there in the big bad world.

86
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:10,314
You know what I'm working with.

87
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:14,644
Fancy a kiss ?

88
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:20,266
Maybe I do.

89
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:24,177
With my luck this scar
will travel to my eye.

90
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:34,189
Tonights pills makes 39, tomorrows
40, 40 winks to follow.

91
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:38,832
40 winks forever.

92
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:52,010
Whatya wanna do, about our Two year anniversary ?

93
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,759
Surprise me, you always do.

94
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,399
VOICES: Just drop that mess in the kitchen,

95
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,029
we'll deal with it later.

96
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:13,058
Nearly caught by the help.

97
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,166
These aren't the rations we ate,

98
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:17,321
they've gone off.

99
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:18,997
That's why we couldn't serve em'.

100
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:21,681
Still a few kinks we have to iron out
before we go into full production.

101
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,232
They're out there conning the
army with tricked out fakes.

102
00:06:24,232 --> 00:06:27,280
They're enjoying French Pate
mixed with Broiled Brisket.

103
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:29,731
They're just rations Gladys.

104
00:06:29,731 --> 00:06:32,606
Who knows if the soldiers will
even need to eat this stuff.

105
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,043
James, I know that soldiers
are obsessed with food.

106
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:40,043
Most times a decent meals the
only pleasure they see in a day.

107
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:42,454
They're out there living off a dogs breakfast,

108
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:44,282
what kind of army are we gonna have ?

109
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:48,533
What kind of business am I going to
have if we can't make a profit ?

110
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:53,472
Oh yeah, go on then, eat it yourself.

111
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:57,411
We'll fix the rations once we
get into production I promise.

112
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,481
DOOR CLOSES

113
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:05,203
Bob, you back ?

114
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,372
Oh dammit, where are you ?

115
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:31,373
You reek of drink, you know that ?

116
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:34,141
This telegram came last night,

117
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:37,436
and where were you, out getting
drunk with your buddies.

118
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:38,296
Is it the boys ?

119
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:40,752
I don't know but it won't
be any good will it.

120
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,624
Nobody ever delivers
good news in a telegram.

121
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,687
I fell asleep waiting !!

122
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:51,642
I couldn't open it without you.

123
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,655
You've got to be kidding me.

124
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:02,327
What is it ?

125
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:06,937
They're handing out the tin already ..... military medal.

126
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:17,611
" For courage and utter disregard for personal safety"

127
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:23,938
Stanley risked his life to
save someone elses, he's okay.

128
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:27,394
LORNA: He must be in North Africa

129
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:31,208
Barely into this mess and they're already
givin' out medals like gum drops.

130
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:34,162
Stanley's a hero, huh, Stanley.

131
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:40,566
It's a game Lorna ......it's like
kids swappin' baseball cards.

132
00:08:44,376 --> 00:08:46,785
Is your heart so dead you
can't even take a moment

133
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:49,737
to feel proud of the man our sons become.

134
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,486
I'm relieved as hell but it doesn't make me blind

135
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:57,665
to the war machine buying off our boys with bits of brass.

136
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:01,663
Since when do you get dressed up for work ?

137
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:07,960
Just showing a little pride Bob.

138
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,896
Leon.... your singing at the canteen dance was amazing.

139
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:19,192
LEON: Uhhh it's good of ya to say

140
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:21,176
I wish I could sing like that.

141
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:26,256
That'd be a novelty act, you look the
way you do sounding the way I do.

142
00:09:26,256 --> 00:09:32,147
I wonder, do you think I might ever be
good enough to sing with the band ?

143
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:37,147
Uh huh hmmm ..... yeah, let me know when you find one.

144
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:45,089
- Hey Kate.
- Hey hi

145
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:51,239
Lorna ... Lorna the telegram, I'm worried.

146
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,604
It was good news,

147
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:55,008
my boy Stanley got the military medal for bravery.

148
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:58,333
Then you must be relieved, and proud.

149
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,084
I am, very.

150
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:02,892
Maybe I was your good luck charm.

151
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,142
Be careful Mr. Moretti.

152
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:12,000
I always am.

153
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:24,249
KATE: Letters mean so much to soldiers
even when they don't know a girl they

154
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,857
like knowing someone's thinking of them.

155
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:30,701
GLADYS: But I do know this soldier, it makes writing
to him worse because I'd be lying to 2 people.

156
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:34,000
KATE: You can't break his heart
before he goes into battle.

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,108
GLADYS: Does seem a wretched thing to do.

158
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:40,829
Stop by tonight,t I'll show you some of the letters
the girls at the rooming house write the boys.

159
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:42,940
That'd be swell.

160
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,512
I'll even nick a few bottles of bubbly for your trouble.

161
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:50,061
- Champagne
- Yeah

162
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:56,271
Another one pregnant.

163
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:57,974
Well, happy news for the husband.

164
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:00,985
Her husband shipped out a year ago.

165
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:04,843
I don't know where your girls find all these men.

166
00:11:05,093 --> 00:11:07,476
I sure would like to have a few
of them around here though.

167
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:10,860
Perhaps love would be a better recruitment tool.

168
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:14,062
What about you, Mrs Corbett ?

169
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:16,646
How's your heart these days ?

170
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,915
Strong and able.

171
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:22,894
Not bursting with emotion ?

172
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:26,236
I don't know what you're insinuating.

173
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:30,314
Well your son, he's one of our first
boys to receive the military medal.

174
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,206
Ah yes we're very proud.

175
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:38,478
Which makes you the perfect speaker for
the factories armistice day service

176
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:42,583
11am on the 11th, the boss has approved the work stoppage.

177
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,675
I'm hardly the type to give speeches sir.

178
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:49,666
You're exactly the kind of woman
our workers need to hear from.

179
00:11:50,174 --> 00:11:52,517
And uh, families welcome, we're clearing the

180
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:57,877
line to make it safe for civies and veterans.

181
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:05,175
JAMES: It's me

182
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:06,878
Come in.

183
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:09,785
Your mother said I could come up.

184
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:12,097
Our business won't take long, sure
you don't want to go out later.

185
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:13,755
GLADYS: Sorry, girls night.

186
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:15,268
We still quarreling ?

187
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,898
GLADYS: That depends, are the rations still vile ?

188
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:19,990
Vile is a little strong.

189
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,675
GLADYS: So was the smell.

190
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:30,990
I spoke to a manager at Tenants plant, he says the
canning sealant has a 3 per cent spoilage rate.

191
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,926
GLADYS: And ?

192
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,228
And increasing the thickness of the seal
would reduce the risks substantially.

193
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:38,426
GLADYS: It's simple, increase the seal.

194
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:41,458
Except the process is more costly.

195
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:44,304
GLADYS: But you know it's
the right thing to do.

196
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,879
GLADYS: James if you win this contract ......

197
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:49,770
There's no if, I'm here to sign it.

198
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:57,380
Withams is now the official supplier of
quality rations to our men overseas.

199
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:01,805
I want to congratulate you but if
those rations aren't improved.

200
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:05,029
We won't poison our troops Gladys.

201
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,021
As you say, they do so much for us.

202
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:16,033
We are all asked to make sacrifices

203
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:26,487
and while not every sacrifice is rewarded ........
it is our duty to do so.

204
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,412
I'll tell you how armistice day should be marked,

205
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:36,784
they should drag out the bodies of about 200
teenage boys scatter 'em in the streets

206
00:13:36,784 --> 00:13:40,175
and let the rats have a go at 'em
that'd be something worth remembering.

207
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:46,317
It's been 25 years Bob, 25 years since you went over that god dammed trench,

208
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:50,238
we have raised 3 children, buried our parents and somehow managed

209
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,804
to keep food on the table and a roof over our heads.

210
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:55,197
But it's like non of that ever happened, non of it

211
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:57,774
because you see everything through the lens

212
00:13:57,774 --> 00:14:00,338
of a few terrible months you had 25 years ago !!!

213
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:02,008
You have no idea what that war .......

214
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:08,427
Because you'd never tell me, I asked, I
hinted, I tried and then finally I gave up !!!

215
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:12,286
You want drag you in to to live
again to some muddy gash of earth,

216
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,335
tell you how everything bled out
on me the day I did my duty

217
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:17,867
and jumped over that trench well I
won't do it, no decent man would !!!

218
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:18,838
Yeah well I think a decent father ......... !!!!

219
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,037
Don't you start with ........... !!!

220
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:22,510
A decent father would let go of his own pain

221
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:29,117
when his learned what a brave
and honorable son he raised !!!

222
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:55,679
- To our boys.
- To our boys !

So it isn't half bad.

225
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:07,341
Careful Betts, champagne has a terrible
reputation for giving girls terrible reputations.

226
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,902
Not to mention terrible hand writing,

227
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:12,138
I can barely read what you've
written these last Two soldiers.

228
00:15:12,138 --> 00:15:13,930
Gladys give us what you've got.

229
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:19,978
GLADYS READING: " Dear Lewis, how
lovely to receive your letters,

230
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:22,478
each time I read one I feel closer to you "

231
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:25,540
BETTY: Though not as close as you got
when you mauled me against a brick wall.

232
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,540
KATE: Betty !!

233
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:33,950
GLADYS READING: " closer to you and proud of the sacrifice
you are making for the safety of our nation. "

234
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,029
So Poetic, you'll stoke his heart Gladys.

235
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,667
Especially if his hearts a
little lower than it once was.

236
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:43,903
I think I'm walking the line impeccably,

237
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:45,884
cheering him up without leading him on.

238
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:47,871
KATE: You should send him some photos.

239
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:49,061
Now that would give him false hope.

240
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,932
Oh give him a kick where it counts.

241
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:55,541
Want a kick, lets go see Leon and his band play.

242
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,325
You know where Leon plays ?

243
00:15:57,325 --> 00:16:00,266
I got a rough idea, yeah.

244
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:03,729
Isn't it a bit late.

245
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:07,385
No one said you had to come.

246
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:13,781
You girls hold the fort.

Hey wait up !!

JAMES READING: "When I return dearest I'll
bring a diamond ring and all my love."

heart beating next to mine. "

" Write soon and tell me that you miss me, all my love Lewis."

James !!

253
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,224
Are we business men or charity carers ?

254
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:41,013
I'm all for healthy profits but it'll cost us less to fix now

255
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:43,482
than if the government forces us to do it later.

256
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:46,124
James you were the one that had a
problem with this spoilage issue.

257
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:48,998
97 per cent of this product is flawless,

258
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:51,395
good enough for any man, especially a soldier.

259
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,326
If you don't like risks don't be a soldier.

260
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:55,375
I've changed my attitude.

Will he beat it ?

Some do, many don't.

285

can't you do anything ?

She's got something special.

Next thing you know she'll move out
of the rooming house and go on tour.

Don't you think your exaggerating.

No, we're not.

You Two are on your own

I'm going to go shopping.

Hitler mustache and started singing.

313
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:21,525
Thank you.

314
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,443
Well next time maybe just you and me.

315
00:21:23,443 --> 00:21:25,430
Yes, and you know what Leon said,

316
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,680
he might let me have a chance on stage with him.

317
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,133
Good thing he likes me.

318
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:01,365
"A little gem for my perfect Jewel"

319
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:04,615
Love James.

320
00:22:08,386 --> 00:22:11,506
They're lovely.

321
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:40,651
There was a bakers dozen.

322
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:52,182
GLADYS: My fiancee found the
letters Lewis wrote from overseas.

323
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:55,541
Maybe I miscounted, after all
he would have said something.

324
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,406
- So you say something first, tell him you were just .....
- Randy

325
00:22:58,406 --> 00:23:01,933
Patriotic !

326
00:23:02,805 --> 00:23:05,774
No fiances going to understand that much patriotism.

327
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:10,266
We're having dinner tonight,
it's our Two year anniversary.

328
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:14,934
Maybe if I'm lucky the factory
will blow up before then.

329
00:23:20,718 --> 00:23:22,596
BUZZER SOUNDS.

330
00:23:32,543 --> 00:23:34,138
Hey Vera .......

331
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:49,436
Vera !!

332
00:23:51,199 --> 00:23:55,906
Still here champ, I wanted
to see you outa here first.

333
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:58,231
Just as I thought, on the mend.

334
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:59,826
Yeah.

335
00:23:59,826 --> 00:24:01,732
You'd better get better
before they kick me outa

336
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:02,998
here I have no intention of leaving this

337
00:24:02,998 --> 00:24:06,141
gorgeous corpse out in
the park somewhere.

338
00:24:06,982 --> 00:24:12,661
Think me and you should go for a walk in the park.

339
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:15,720
Nurse !!

340
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,919
Nurse !!

341
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:26,762
KNOCKING ON DOOR

342
00:24:26,762 --> 00:24:28,938
Come on in.

343
00:24:29,221 --> 00:24:31,623
Ba Ba beep da doeeeee

344
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:35,013
Betty at the door ba deep ba
door ba beep ba doeee yaaa.

345
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:36,439
That's scat singing.

346
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:39,000
Yeah, I've heard about it.

347
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,702
I think I'm getting the hang of it not exactly
Ella singing mr Paganini yet but .......

348
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:47,092
Scatting, singing the blues .......

349
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,561
Not everybody can do it.

350
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:55,501
Betty , you sound kind of prejudiced.

351
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,421
Kate  it's a bad idea,

352
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:04,974
goin' to sing at the club you make one little
mistake and they will tear you to shreds.

353
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:07,660
That's not the impression I got from Leon.

354
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,484
Yeah well he'd have his own reasons for
giving you a different impression.

355
00:25:10,484 --> 00:25:13,691
He's been nothing but decent to me.

356
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:14,842
I'm just trying to spare you.

357
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:17,534
From what, happiness ?

358
00:25:17,534 --> 00:25:19,284
No, from getting hurt.

359
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:24,563
I found something I love, I don't
care if I fall on my face.

360
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:41,376
Did I surprise you with my restaurant choice ?

361
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,550
You surprised me alright.

362
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:49,987
You haven't said anything about
how your present looks on me.

363
00:25:49,987 --> 00:25:53,987
The ear rings, they look lovely.

364
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,206
You always look beautiful.

365
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:59,082
Thank you.

366
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:06,255
I see you got some mail.

367
00:26:06,255 --> 00:26:09,924
Go on, it seems I'm not the
only one who thinks so.

368
00:26:09,924 --> 00:26:11,598
Oh James.

369
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:12,333
You can do better than that,

370
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:15,725
you're never at a loss for words.

371
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:21,346
He was an airman, shipped out
the next day, he was scared.

372
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,237
He needed to know that somebody would
care for him while he was overseas,

373
00:26:23,944 --> 00:26:25,739
somehow that became me.

374
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:29,855
Somehow, I told you about
Hazel, I prostrated myself

375
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:34,303
before you and all the time
your the cat who got the cream.

376
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,379
Huh !!!

377
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:38,901
It happened so quickly.

378
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:42,195
You promised to marry him !!!!

379
00:26:44,568 --> 00:26:48,256
It was only words, they didn't mean anything.

380
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:51,879
Apparently none of them do.

381
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:00,007
You can keep the engagement ring.

382
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:02,629
James please.

383
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:06,054
Please get out of the car.

384
00:27:28,671 --> 00:27:29,881
Harps ?

385
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:33,631
Bag pipes, it's Armistice day dope.

386
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:35,428
Hey you're still here.

387
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:38,758
I told you, I'm waitin' until you get better.

388
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,774
COUGHES

389
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:44,993
Okay, shhh

390
00:27:45,198 --> 00:27:49,041
It's got a hold of me Vera, I can't do it.

391
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:53,044
Sure you can, this can turn around.

392
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:57,882
You got a choice Vera, I got none.

393
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:03,029
You gotta help me Vera, I'm not gonna make it.

394
00:28:06,342 --> 00:28:12,510
Okay .......... okay.

395
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,710
Lorna !

396
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:32,337
I barely recognised you, quite the show huh ?

397
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,565
Your family here ?

398
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:35,027
No they were busy sir.

399
00:28:35,027 --> 00:28:36,892
Shame, I'd like to meet your husband.

400
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:40,432
A soldier who survived the
Somme, far too few of them.

401
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:44,980
I lost my brother and Three
cousins there, excuse me.

402
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,752
Which one of us has been asked to
make sacrifices at times when they

403
00:28:52,752 --> 00:28:57,253
seem impossible but it is our duty to think of ...
.................

404
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:01,400
Marco, someone will see.

405
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:09,876
Mama mia who is this woman ?

406
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,974
I don't know her anymore.

407
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,429
I'm gonna find us a place.

408
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:19,913
Make it soon.

409
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:40,195
Look there's mum, doesn't
her new dress look swell.

410
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,944
Let's get up front.

411
00:29:41,944 --> 00:29:45,291
Uh no, take me over there.

412
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:47,506
I don't want to be in the line of fire
when all the show boating starts.

413
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:58,335
BAG PIPES PLAYING

414
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:07,634
Good morning family friends and co workers.

415
00:30:08,195 --> 00:30:11,726
I am honored to be addressing you today.

416
00:30:12,634 --> 00:30:17,244
This is a time ..................

417
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:29,336
A time when each one of us has
been asked to make sacrifices.

418
00:30:30,227 --> 00:30:33,698
At times they may seem impossible,

419
00:30:34,243 --> 00:30:38,636
but it is our duty to think of the greater good.

420
00:30:39,008 --> 00:30:48,609
Forget our solitary, I'm a little nervous,
my husband is here I .......................

421
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:54,909
I didn't expect that.

422
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,029
We're a typical married couple

423
00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:01,478
neither one of us knowing what the other ones doing.

424
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:22,416
Bob doesn't have much use for this kind of ceremony.

425
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:27,447
When he came back from the first
war he was badly injured and felt

426
00:31:27,745 --> 00:31:32,619
like everything that had happened
to him had been for nothing.

427
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:38,389
Sometimes I can see how he'd
feel like that used and spat out

428
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:43,416
by folks who honestly couldn't
give a damn if he lived or died.

429
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:49,079
But if he hadn't fought in that
war, if all those other soldiers

430
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:55,949
hadn't made their sacrifice, we
wouldn't be standing here today.

431
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,470
I have Two sons overseas,

432
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:09,426
they've seen dangers I can't even
know the shape of and here

433
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:13,367
we are building the bombs
that make them strong.

434
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:17,459
You can't say we don't pay a price.

435
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:25,528
Sometimes you know when a thing is right.

436
00:32:26,804 --> 00:32:29,741
What's a few small sacrifices on our part

437
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:34,177
when we stand to win back  the happiness

438
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,099
and freedom we deserve. Thank you.

439
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:49,009
They all gotta go down Archie.

440
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,916
That a boy.

441
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,849
Don't you fall asleep yet.

442
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:12,393
You know, after my accident

443
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:16,533
Edith told me Lorna argued with doctor Poytche,

444
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:20,521
said he had to do right by me with surgery.

445
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:26,432
She called me a soldier, same as any man here.

446
00:33:26,432 --> 00:33:31,913
And I liked that, I suppose I still do.

447
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,895
That's the Two of us Archie, we're soldiers .........

448
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:41,881
on the home front.

449
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:46,847
Come on, one last mile you can do it.

450
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:50,318
I am with you.

451
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:05,865
Well done darling, we're home.

452
00:34:43,384 --> 00:34:47,709
Mum look at you, and that speech, sure wasn't the one you were practicing.

453
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:50,038
I wouldna let you out of the house if it was.

454
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,211
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

455
00:34:51,211 --> 00:34:54,007
You didn't, you did good, real good.

456
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:56,666
Thank you.

457
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,776
BOB: The things I say I don't mean any harm.

458
00:35:01,776 --> 00:35:05,417
I know Bob, same here.

459
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:11,040
MUSIC PLAYS.

460
00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:26,412
- I'm a clot.
- With tin ears.

461
00:35:27,162 --> 00:35:29,478
Both.

462
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:35,492
- Has he asked you up yet ?
- No

463
00:35:37,364 --> 00:35:43,207
We'd like to ease our way into the
evening with a special guest.

464
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:47,162
Go, he's not going to wait forever, go go !!.

465
00:35:57,806 --> 00:36:05,309
KATE SINGS: I wished on the moon for something I never knew.

466
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:21,290
Wished on he moon for more than I ever knew.
A sweeter rose a softer sky on April days,

467
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:28,713
that would not dance away.

468
00:36:53,582 --> 00:37:09,371
I begged on the stars to throw me a beam or Two.
Wished on the stars and asked for a dream or Two.

469
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:24,717
I looked for every loviness it all came true,
I wished on the moon for you.

470
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:31,487
CLAPPING AND APPLAUSE.

471
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:36,059
Kate Andrews.

472
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:47,326
GLADYS: Dear Lewis, the day we met I
let my good judgment get swept away.

473
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:54,169
First in attending the dance and
then in, in our further intimacies.

474
00:37:54,169 --> 00:37:57,817
Lewis I am engaged to another man.

475
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,530
I was wrong to have pretended otherwise and I

476
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,579
was thoughtless in accepting your proposal.

477
00:38:02,919 --> 00:38:08,749
Although he has no reason to believe
it I love my fiancee deeply.

478
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:13,345
My heart belongs to him ....

479
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,518
What he wanted was so simple,

480
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:26,671
and he made me feel like only I could give it to him.

481
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:40,570
Is there some way ?

482
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,751
You were intimate with this man.

483
00:38:42,751 --> 00:38:44,693
It was just some kissing and petting,

484
00:38:44,693 --> 00:38:46,378
you had a full fledged sexual affair.

485
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:47,582
It's not the same thing.

486
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:48,250
KATE: Why not ?

487
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,693
Because I didn't care about her,
she meant nothing to me.

488
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:56,519
Except you showed her more of
yourself than I have ever seen.

489
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,321
What are you afraid of James ?

490
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:03,641
That this is me, that this is all there is.

491
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:10,051
That's all I've ever wanted.

492
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:13,489
If  I've done this all wrong I'm so sorry,

493
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:17,959
I'm so sorry.

494
00:39:18,674 --> 00:39:20,380
Make it up to me.

495
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:24,133
You sure ?

496
00:39:24,564 --> 00:39:27,175
Yes.

497
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:35,849
I love you.

498
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:38,564
I love you too.

499
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:52,676
- James.
- I told you I learned a thing or Two.

500
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,817
Was it worth the wait ?

501
00:39:58,132 --> 00:40:02,036
Only if we make up for lost time.

502
00:40:03,395 --> 00:40:06,100
Your letter to that airman,
what was his name ?

503
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,474
Lewis.

504
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:09,974
You can't send it.

505
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,195
I have to tell him the truth,
he needs to know it's over.

506
00:40:12,195 --> 00:40:17,053
Right now he thinks that he's
taking you into battle with him.

507
00:40:17,053 --> 00:40:19,927
You can break his heart when the war is over.

508
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:23,216
I'm sure he'll have forgotten me by then.

509
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:26,554
I don't think that's possible.

510
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:32,475
Your top drawer James Dunn.

511
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:48,570
You're here to see Vera ?

512
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:54,378
Yes .... I heard about your friend, I'm so sorry.

513
00:40:57,927 --> 00:40:59,799
There's people.

514
00:40:59,799 --> 00:41:05,348
I'm merely comforting a co worker,
nothing more nothing less.

515
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:08,800
Yeah.

516
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,659
Were you close ?

517
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,082
Not really but somehow I'm the
one they asked to touch his things.

518
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:19,395
What about Archie's family ?

519
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:21,706
He was alone Lorna.

520
00:41:21,706 --> 00:41:24,910
No family no friends, that's
how it is in the end.

521
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,832
Well, lucky we have our families.

522
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,551
Yeah, I saw your husband yesterday.

523
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:30,972
Yes you did.

524
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:33,599
Not exactly what I was expecting.

525
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,761
Bob's a good man.

526
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:36,381
Why, because he wheeled out for one speech.

527
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:38,321
How dare you !!

528
00:41:38,321 --> 00:41:39,742
You're not happy with him Lorna.

529
00:41:39,742 --> 00:41:44,941
I know what it cost him to do
that, to be there, you don't.

530
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:50,770
There isn't going to be a
safe place for us is there ?

531
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,473
I wish there were.

532
00:41:53,681 --> 00:42:01,334
So brief you know Lorna, if your
gonna burn why not burn bright ?

533
00:42:06,163 --> 00:42:09,431
I rang cook, requested
something special for lunch.

534
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:13,324
Not yet married and already acting the hostess.

535
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:20,210
It seemed appropriate to mark Armistice day
with an act of solidarity with our soldiers.

536
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,185
A day late, but not a dollar short.

537
00:42:23,185 --> 00:42:24,476
Not even a dime.

538
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:26,124
You think this is funny ?

539
00:42:26,124 --> 00:42:28,086
Of course if this comes from one of those

540
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:29,747
Three per cent cans that may be spoiled,

541
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,042
Whataya you think James,

542
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:32,683
about Ten minutes from here to the hospital ?

543
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,183
Sounds about right.

544
00:42:35,183 --> 00:42:36,998
Get this outa my face!

545
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,017
All the more for me.

546
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:45,078
Hmmm Ptomaine poison.

547
00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:46,165
Gladys !

548
00:42:46,165 --> 00:42:48,715
You've no clue the compromises that come with doing business.

549
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:50,977
I know all about compromise father,

550
00:42:50,977 --> 00:42:52,916
doing the right thing for as many people as possible.

551
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:56,126
If we increase the density of he interior lag the spoilage rate

552
00:42:56,524 --> 00:43:00,137
goes down to almost nil production costs up two per cent.

553
00:43:00,137 --> 00:43:02,228
Next thing you know we'll be doing this for nothing.

554
00:43:02,228 --> 00:43:05,338
I have as much say in this as you do.

555
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:11,697
Well, I've lost my appetite.

556
00:43:13,014 --> 00:43:17,463
Where'd you dream up this little antic,
last nights sleep over with Carol.

557
00:43:17,463 --> 00:43:21,840
Turns out I didn't get much sleep.
