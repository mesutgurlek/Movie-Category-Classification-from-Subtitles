00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:59,081
This is Lila. Lila is my forest wife.

162
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,158
I see.

163
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:05,602
Congratulations.

164
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:09,599
Interesting concept.

165
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:12,121
As long as his village wife
stays in hiding.

168
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:26,002
- Hello, boys. What can we do for you?
- Food. We want food.

169
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:32,839
These little shits are holding us up.
Do you have the balls to shoot me?

170
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:34,645
We have food. We'll share.

171
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,924
No. I want to see if the little shit
has the balls to shoot me.

172
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,475
You like to shoot Jews, little shit?
Huh?

173
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,956
- You are Jews?
- No, we're the Gestapo.

174
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:45,800
- Put down the gun.
- Before I shove it up your ass.

175
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,560
- Hey! Look at me! Where you from?
- Horodyszcze.

176
00:21:49,887 --> 00:21:53,800
We haven't eaten in two days.
My name is Paretz.

177
00:21:53,887 --> 00:21:55,479
This is Jacov.

178
00:21:56,287 --> 00:22:00,803
Two days ago there were 3,000 Jews
in Horodyszcze. And now... there are 50.

179
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:03,242
Me and him, we hid in a wall.

180
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,842
Do you know a woman... Sonia Bielski?

181
00:22:11,527 --> 00:22:12,755
We knew her.

182
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,479
There was a child.

- No.
- I... Sonia!

- So many dead!
- I know.

192
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:31,756
Why not us?

193
00:23:32,647 --> 00:23:34,319
I don't know.

194
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,162
Better to be hiding in the woods...

195
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,598
...like rabbits...

196
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:46,000
...hunted. No.

197
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:55,118
We're looking for partisans.
What is the name of your otriad?

198
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:57,562
- What is an otriad?
- It's an armed brigade.

199
00:23:57,647 --> 00:24:00,445
We heard the Russians
are beginning to organise.

200
00:24:00,527 --> 00:24:03,405
- Here?
- And also in Lipicanska.

201
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:06,957
Then we are the Bielski Otriad.
You want to join?

202
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:11,044
- The Russians are fighters.
- But you need a gun to join them.

203
00:24:11,127 --> 00:24:13,436
They sabotage railroads
and kill Germans.

204
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:17,076
You want to kill Germans?
Come with me.

205
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:20,125
Unless you're still afraid
to use that rifle.

206
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:22,198
Stay there. Stay there!

207
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:27,477
We must get what we need
without killing.

208
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:32,083
- This will not bring your family back.
- Blood for blood.

209
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:35,567
- You had yours.
- And I can still see their faces.

210
00:24:35,647 --> 00:24:40,198
- "Vengeance is mine." Who said that?
- This is God's work you're doing now?

211
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:43,199
No, only you can do that.
Take a few lives, spare others.

212
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:46,484
- We must not become like them.
- No, but we can kill like them.

213
00:24:49,327 --> 00:24:50,885
Are you coming with us or not?

The Talmud says, if you save a life,
you must take responsibility for it.

251

Again, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

252

Oh, yes. I think you do.
And now your little brother is gone.

I said enough! Get up! Get up!

258
00:30:44,847 --> 00:30:47,919
He should be shot. If we

Mistake?

262
00:30:57,207 --> 00:31:00,040
- We cannot make mistakes, Tuvia.
- Like last night, Zus.

263
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,038
First they will torture Asael...

...and then they will hang him.

You are Tuvia Bielski?

- You know me?
- We heard of you in Vilna.

267
00:31:17,087 --> 00:31:19,726
- My sister lives in Vilna!
- My family is there!

268

- Do we?
- We have no food!

273
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,919
- Tomorrow will be another mission.
- Like last time?

274
00:31:38,007 --> 00:31:40,999
- We won't make that mistake again.
- How do you know?

275
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,920
<i>- (all shout)
- We may be here a long time.</i>

276
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:45,918
- We have to prepare.
- How?

277
00:31:46,007 --> 00:31:48,680
Better security,
better at getting food...

278
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,645
We don't have weapons.
People are getting sick.

279

<i>- (all shout)

<i>(all continue to shout)</i>

281
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:05,405
Whatever it takes,
we all have to participate!

282
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:08,718
<i>- We can't work against each other!
- (all fall silent)</i>

283
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:28,046
We cannot afford revenge. Not now!

284
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:33,006
We cannot afford to lose friends
like Jacov and Peretz.

285
00:32:33,087 --> 00:32:34,520
Or Asael.

286
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,478
We cannot lose anyone.

287
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:11,682
We will map out where we have been...

288
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:15,321
...so as not to visit
the same farms too often,

289
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:18,444
and we will take only from those
who can afford to give,

290
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:21,485
and we will leave those who can't alone.

291
00:33:22,487 --> 00:33:24,045
Our revenge...

292
00:33:25,007 --> 00:33:27,885
...is to live.
- The poorest farmer has more than us.

293
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:31,437
Quiet. What I am saying is,
we are not thieves or murderers.

294
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:36,957
We may be hunted like animals,
but we will not become animals.

295
00:33:38,887 --> 00:33:40,400
We have all chosen this...

296
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,923
...to live here free, like human beings,
for as long as we can.

297
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:49,565
Every day of freedom
is like an act of faith.

298
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:55,043
And if we should die,
trying to live...

299
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:59,806
...then at least we die
like human beings.

300
00:35:24,327 --> 00:35:26,522
Thank God. Come here! Come here!

301
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:29,326
Come, Asael!

302
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:36,159
<i>- (laughs)
- Zus... Zus, I can't breathe.</i>

303
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:40,001
I can't breathe.
Look. Look. Look what we found.

304
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:41,998
Where did you get these?

305
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:43,756
Hello.

306
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:48,602
- It is alright. Please come.
- Please.

307
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:51,155
<i>- (Asael) It is alright.

308
00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:52,475
Give me that.

309
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:59,726
- Asael, you've been busy!
- Shut up.

310
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,959
Hello. I am Zus.

311
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:04,800
This is Bella and this is Chaya.

312
00:36:04,887 --> 00:36:07,560
- Please, come. You must be hungry.
- Thank you.

313
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:20,884
And then, we fell into
this horrible bog,

314
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:23,435
and Chaya saved me. I can't swim at all.

315
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:28,078
- Well, we'll have to teach you.
- We must have got lost a dozen times.

316
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:31,876
I was resigned to die. Tell him, Chaya.
Was it not the absolute worst?

317
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:34,879
- And that farmer, a Mr er...
- Koscik.

318
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:37,356
Yes.
He kept making the most vulgar jokes.

319
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:44,560
So you're trying to tell me
that all politics is meaningless?

320
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:47,241
In the West,
the monster with the little moustache.

321
00:36:47,327 --> 00:36:50,603
In the East, the monster with
the big moustache. That is politics.

322
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:53,565
Your Messiah will have a moustache,
too, and a full beard.

323
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:56,764
No. The messiahs are all in politics,
and they are killing us.

324
00:36:56,847 --> 00:37:00,726
- No...
- What's killing me is all your talking.

325

<i>(quietly) And Roosevelt?
He has no moustache.</i>

326
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:11,244
We need to know about the villages,

327
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:13,761
where the Germans are,
who the informers are.

328
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:18,482
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes. Yes.

329
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:22,325
- What's her name?
- Chaya.

330
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,956
Chaya!

331
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,241
What are you doing?

332
00:37:30,327 --> 00:37:31,965
- Talk to her.
- I hardly know her.

333
00:37:32,047 --> 00:37:34,117
You spent three days in a cellar
with her.

334
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:36,437
Malbin says
the Piznarski granary is full.

335
00:37:36,527 --> 00:37:39,405
- But we still need two guns at least.
- Whose turn is it to go?

336
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:42,001
- Zus.
- You go with him.

337
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:43,759
Make sure he understands my orders.

338
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:48,637
Go! Go and talk to her! Go!

339
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,080
Hello. How are you?

340
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:56,316
- Fine.
- Good.

Germans empty-handed. Tuvia's orders.

343

Halt! Who goes there?

344
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,597
You know who goes there, Lazar.
We go there.

345
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:57,157
You only say "Who goes there?"
When you don't know who goes there.

346
00:38:58,167 --> 00:39:00,237
Sorry, Zus.

347
00:39:00,327 --> 00:39:03,637
Milk! And eggs! Chaya, our brave men
have brought us a feast.

- You are Chaya.
- Yes.

352
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:18,522
You're getting along alright?
Anything you need? An extra blanket?

353
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,121
Er, no, thank you. I am fine.

354

- Oh. Something nice... and soft?
- No, it is alright.

355
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:29,636
You don't have a husband yet.

356
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:31,922
- Yet?
- A forest husband.

357
00:39:32,007 --> 00:39:36,239
All the other women have chosen
already. They haven't told you?

358
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:39,478
No, they haven't.
Thank you for explaining it.

They are from Novogrudok.

Tell me something. Why is there a rule
against women having guns?

376
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:49,559
- There aren't enough for the men.
- Women need guns, too.

377
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:51,795
What for?

378
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:55,715
For... protection.

379
00:41:57,207 --> 00:41:59,198
Women have men for protection.

They'll be back.
We will have to build a new camp.

- Next time you can draw them a map.
- And what does that mean?

401
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:33,245
It means we should have killed
the fucking milkman.

Your policy of diplomacy is shit.

Winter is coming,
and now we have no shelter. Why?

00:54:58,287 --> 00:55:01,279
Lova, Ben Zion...

472
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:06,479
And anyone else who'd rather fight
than wait to be killed...

473
00:55:08,407 --> 00:55:10,921
...we're leaving to join those who fight.

474
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:17,446
Are you coming?

475
00:55:20,647 --> 00:55:21,682
No.

476
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:46,366
<i>(announcement over loudspeaker
in German)</i>

477
00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:37,401
<i>(chatter)</i>

478
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:41,758
<i>(elder) We are not so naive to think
they won't kill some of us,</i>

479
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:45,237
but all the Jews? It makes no sense.

480
00:56:45,327 --> 00:56:49,605
They need us to work in the factories,
in the labour camps.

481
00:56:49,687 --> 00:56:51,086
They're death camps.

482
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:56,446
We, too, have heard of such places.

483
00:56:56,527 --> 00:56:58,597
But have you seen them yourself?

484
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:04,156
Can you tell me with absolute certainty
that we won't just as likely die

485
00:57:04,247 --> 00:57:07,364
out there with you in the woods,
with winter coming on?

486
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:15,116
Do you think we haven't all considered
running away?

487
00:57:15,207 --> 00:57:18,005
For every one who leaves, they kill 20.

488
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:21,477
How can I sacrifice thousands
for the sake of a few?

489
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:24,806
What if we take you all?

490
00:57:26,607 --> 00:57:29,326
The old? The sick? How will we live?

491
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:32,797
We will protect you. We have alliances
with Russian partisans.

492
00:57:32,887 --> 00:57:37,358
They're as bad as the Germans!
You're too young to know the pogroms.

493
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:40,996
Our only weapon is time.

494
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:43,362
If I can buy more, we will have won.

495
00:57:43,447 --> 00:57:46,120
You want time?

496
00:57:46,207 --> 00:57:49,244
Fine. I'll give you time.

497
00:57:49,327 --> 00:57:53,718
A day, a month, maybe even a year.
To live.

498
00:57:56,687 --> 00:57:59,121
Your daughter, Chaya. She is with us.

499
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,400
Your husband is waiting for you.

500
00:58:03,487 --> 00:58:05,876
Rabbi... Rabbi, please.

501
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:08,083
We're waiting for God.

502
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,278
<i>(woman 1) I am going.</i>

503

00:58:24,887 --> 00:58:26,240
I am going.

00:58:27,847 --> 00:58:29,075
<i>(woman 3) Me, too.</i>

507
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,480
Wait.

508
00:58:57,807 --> 00:58:59,718
Come on. Come.

509
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,684
Move forward! Come along, please!
Come forward!

510
00:59:28,767 --> 00:59:31,964
Please have your valuables out
and ready. Keep moving.

511
00:59:32,047 --> 00:59:34,436
Come! We're not going to bite you.

512
00:59:36,247 --> 00:59:37,805
Mama! Papa!

513
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:44,083
- Ah! What about you, Tateh?
- I am a watchmaker.

514
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,919
Can you repair guns?

515
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:51,637
- The trigger.
- Maybe.

516
00:59:53,487 --> 00:59:56,957
Come forward. Have your things out
and ready. Please...

517
00:59:58,927 --> 01:00:02,363
- They were my grandmother's.
- And now they belong to the Otriad.

518
01:00:02,447 --> 01:00:05,200
Everyone sacrifices
for the sake of the collective!

519
01:00:05,287 --> 01:00:07,721
We can trade this
for food or weapons. Next!

520
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,286
How about carpenters?

521
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:12,484
- Any bootmakers? Seamstresses?
- I am an accountant.

522
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:16,166
- Well, that should come in handy!
- Alright!

523
01:00:21,647 --> 01:00:24,400
<i>(chuckles) You have a new profession.</i>

524
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,603
<i>- Mazel tov.
- (laughs)</i>

525
01:00:27,607 --> 01:00:29,359
- Next!
- I am a shoemaker.

526
01:00:29,447 --> 01:00:32,325
- Good. You are welcome.
- Yes, please?

527
01:00:32,407 --> 01:00:36,958
- I am a nurse.
- Ah! Good. You are most welcome.

528
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:40,919
Friends!
This is the happiest day of my life,

529
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:44,556
to see you here, safely amongst us.

530
01:00:45,367 --> 01:00:48,325
But there are a few things
you must learn about living here.

531
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:55,239
When you are rested and settled,
you will be assigned work duties.

532
01:00:55,327 --> 01:00:57,602
Everyone will work.
There are no exceptions.

533
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:01,236
We will help supply
our Russian partisan comrades.

534
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:04,763
We will mend clothes.
We will repair weapons.

535
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:08,681
Women will learn to shoot,
and they will fight alongside men.

536
01:01:10,127 --> 01:01:11,924
Pregnancies are forbidden.

537
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:15,044
We cannot accommodate
an infant's needs here.

538
01:01:20,647 --> 01:01:25,880
Today... we will start rebuilding
the lives you have all lost.

539
01:01:30,447 --> 01:01:35,077
This is the one place in all
of Belorussia where a Jew can be free.

540
01:01:40,127 --> 01:01:42,436
We welcome you into our community.

541
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:53,805
- He is a Jew?
- Yes.

542
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:57,682
Reload!

543
01:01:59,287 --> 01:02:01,039
<i>(chatter)</i>

544
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:06,599
This is not a gun!
To you, it is Bar Kochba's spear.

545
01:02:06,687 --> 01:02:10,202
It is Samson's jawbone.
It is Ehud's sword.

546
01:02:11,407 --> 01:02:14,922
It is the slingshot young David used
to bring down the monster Goliath.

547
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:18,558
And we will become warriors...

548
01:02:20,047 --> 01:02:23,357
...like the Maccabees and the Sicarii,

549
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:27,076
brave men and women
fighting for their freedom.

550
01:02:28,647 --> 01:02:29,875
As they were.

551
01:02:32,407 --> 01:02:33,601
Fire!

552
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,159
Good.

553
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,726
Boom!

554
01:03:18,807 --> 01:03:19,922
<i>(laughs)</i>

555
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:28,762
<i>(whistles casually)</i>

556
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:36,077
Now, this here... this is a knight.

557
01:03:36,167 --> 01:03:39,000
It can move one, two, forward,
and one to the side.

558
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:43,846
Yesterday potato with beets,
today beets with potatoes...

559
01:03:43,927 --> 01:03:45,963
Tomorrow, special treat. Potato soup.

560
01:03:46,047 --> 01:03:50,086
Stop complaining, you wenches,
and keep mashing.

561
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:53,318
- We love potatoes, don't we, boys?
- Yes, sir!

562
01:03:53,407 --> 01:03:55,443
We like latkes, blintzes...

563
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:59,156
Thank you! Sit down.
Put some hairs on your chest.

564
01:04:00,367 --> 01:04:02,676
If you want to be a soldier, you drink!

565
01:04:03,647 --> 01:04:06,036
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

566
01:04:06,127 --> 01:04:08,595
<i>- (coughs)
- He's having a little drink.</i>

567
01:04:09,687 --> 01:04:12,997
So... a little bird told me

568
01:04:13,087 --> 01:04:16,602
that a certain someone is waiting
for another certain someone

569
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,882
to ask a certain question.

570
01:04:30,847 --> 01:04:32,917
- Hello, Chaya.
- Hello, Asael.

571
01:04:33,007 --> 01:04:34,281
- Let me take it.
- No, no.

572
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:37,200
- Are you sure?
- I am fine. Thank you.

573
01:04:42,847 --> 01:04:44,326
May I help you?

574
01:04:45,407 --> 01:04:49,525
Chaya, I was wondering if...
maybe...

575
01:04:49,607 --> 01:04:51,518
you... I mean,

576
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:54,804
you and I... if... we...

577
01:04:54,887 --> 01:04:57,924
- I accept.
- You do?

578
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:00,802
I do.

579
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:11,797
<i>(Shimon) Blessed art Thou, our God,

Oh, gladden these loving mates

585
01:05:32,527 --> 01:05:36,964
as Thou did anciently gladden
Thy creatures in Eden.

<i>Blessed art Thou, O God,</i>

Thank you, Tuvia.

Hm!
She's a tasty one, your aristocrat.

633
01:13:44,847 --> 01:13:48,556
- What?
- We were told "hands off".

634
01:13:48,647 --> 01:13:51,115
"Property of the commander."

635
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:57,359
Tuvia, I'm beginning to see signs
of some new sickness.

636
01:13:57,447 --> 01:13:59,961
Two of the old ones have died this week.

637

Tuvia!

638

- Miriam!
- What happened?

639
01:14:04,127 --> 01:14:07,836
- He says it was a patrol.
- They are watching the roads.

640

- You go back. You stay alert!

She will be alright.

642
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,836
Take your food back now,
and stay on this side of the river.

643
01:14:21,927 --> 01:14:25,203
But watch out for patrols.
I'll wait here for the others.

644

Good luck.

On food missions,
they take for themselves

That you take
whatever woman you choose.

721
01:23:19,967 --> 01:23:24,324
- That we keep the gold for ourselves.
- And what? What? What else?

That you are no longer fit to lead us.

786
01:31:43,007 --> 01:31:46,044
Who's got the soap?
I know there is a little bit left.

787
01:31:46,127 --> 01:31:48,800
Use the sand, Chaya.
It's good for your skin.

788
01:31:48,887 --> 01:31:52,562
And look at that skin!
And married already!

789

<i>(laughter)</i>

790
01:31:54,967 --> 01:31:57,356
Oh, look at me!
I've turned into a skeleton!

791
01:31:57,447 --> 01:31:59,199
When we get out of this forest,

792
01:31:59,287 --> 01:32:01,881
I'm going to eat only cake
and grow as big as a house.

793
01:32:01,967 --> 01:32:04,845
<i>- (laughter)
- Tamara! Come!</i>

794
01:32:04,927 --> 01:32:06,997
Join us! At least the sun is warm.

795
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:20,126
- I can't, Lilka.
- Why?

796
01:32:28,727 --> 01:32:31,287
- I am pregnant.
- I had no idea!

797
01:32:32,727 --> 01:32:37,960
I've been hiding it for months,
but, er, it's obvious now.

798
01:32:39,087 --> 01:32:42,682
- It could come any day.
- Who is the father?

799
01:32:51,367 --> 01:32:54,643
It happened when I...
when I was escaping.

800
01:32:56,527 --> 01:32:57,642
It was a...

801
01:32:58,687 --> 01:33:01,406
...a man with a gun. He stopped me.

802
01:33:08,487 --> 01:33:11,285
What will happen when Tuvia finds out?

803
01:33:11,367 --> 01:33:14,518
- He will understand.
- No. You mustn't tell him.

804
01:33:14,607 --> 01:33:17,644
I won't. I won't tell him.

805
01:33:21,367 --> 01:33:23,403
I feel there's new life inside me.

806
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:27,558
It's the only thing keeping me going.

807
01:33:29,727 --> 01:33:31,922
And I won't give it up.

808
01:33:32,887 --> 01:33:34,400
No.

809
01:33:45,607 --> 01:33:49,361
Lazar says he spotted another patrol.
They're getting closer.

810

<i>(baby cries)</i>

811

You hear that?

812
01:33:56,687 --> 01:33:58,245
Here.

813
01:34:07,007 --> 01:34:10,044
- She promises not to take extra.
- This is against my orders!

814
01:34:10,127 --> 01:34:12,277
So you're going to shoot her, too?

815
01:34:13,567 --> 01:34:16,877
Please, Tuvia.
The baby is all she has to live for.

816
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:20,835
- I cannot allow it.
- You must let it live.

817
01:34:20,927 --> 01:34:23,157
I cannot keep the living alive!

<i>(baby wails)</i>

819
01:34:26,567 --> 01:34:29,957
Tamara and the man who fathered
this child are responsible for it.

820
01:34:30,687 --> 01:34:34,646
- They must leave.
- She was raped by the Germans.

821
01:34:37,567 --> 01:34:41,116
You tell us to hold on to our humanity,

822
01:34:41,207 --> 01:34:43,721
not to become like animals.

823
01:34:43,807 --> 01:34:48,039
What better way than by bringing a life
into this world of suffering and death?

824
01:34:50,927 --> 01:34:52,246
It is our only hope.

825
01:35:00,927 --> 01:35:02,724
Alright.

826
01:35:02,807 --> 01:35:04,877
Thank you, Tuvia!

827
01:35:33,367 --> 01:35:37,201
I know what is expected of the women
here, and yet you never touched me.

828
01:35:37,287 --> 01:35:40,006
- Lilka...
- I'm not afraid of anything, Tuvia.

829
01:35:40,927 --> 01:35:42,645
I'm not even afraid of you.

830
01:35:59,087 --> 01:36:00,440
You call that a move?

831
01:36:00,527 --> 01:36:04,839
I call it an inevitable conclusion
based on unimpeachable reasoning.

832
01:36:04,927 --> 01:36:08,886
The question, my friend the genius,
is what are you going to do about it?

833
01:36:08,967 --> 01:36:10,764
I'm thinking about what I'll do.

834
01:36:10,847 --> 01:36:12,997
<i>(laughs) I got him!</i>

835
01:36:13,087 --> 01:36:16,682
Tuvia! We found this one and two
of his friends by the second bridge.

836
01:36:16,767 --> 01:36:19,964
We killed two. Aron was hurt,
but he's a brave little soldier.

837
01:36:20,047 --> 01:36:21,685
- We found this.
- You alright?

<i>(man) Filthy German dog!</i>

840

We found this in his pouch.

01:36:30,927 --> 01:36:32,599

842
01:36:37,447 --> 01:36:40,996

Look! We are all Jews!

844
01:36:45,007 --> 01:36:47,237

<i>(all continue to shout)</i>

849
01:37:00,607 --> 01:37:03,121
They've assigned a division
to surround the forest.

850
01:37:03,207 --> 01:37:06,597
- Don't they have a war to fight?
- The assault begins in two days.

851
01:37:07,887 --> 01:37:11,038
Passover. How fitting!

If you let him go,
he will lead them back here.

If I had stayed in the ghetto,

<i>But the children of Israel... (coughs)</i>

885
01:41:30,447 --> 01:41:34,406
The children of Israel
were afraid to leave Egypt,

886
01:41:34,487 --> 01:41:38,196
until Moses said, "Do not trust in me."

887
01:41:38,287 --> 01:41:41,438
"Trust in God.
He will take care of you."

888
01:41:42,527 --> 01:41:44,995
And that is why, tomorrow,

889
01:41:45,087 --> 01:41:47,237
we will celebrate the Passover

- Tomorrow is Passover, yes?
- So?

893
01:41:59,727 --> 01:42:03,163
Moses. The Exodus. He left
before Pharaoh could stop them.

894

You want to move them all?
The old, the sick?
