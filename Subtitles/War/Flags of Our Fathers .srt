1
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,988
Corpsman!

2
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,291
Corpsman!

3
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,368
Corpsman!

4
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,278
For God sakes! Corpsman!

5
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,453
Corpsman!

6
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,960
Corpsman!

7
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,635
Honey, what's wrong?

8
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,320
<i>Every jackass thinks he knows</i>
<i>what war is.</i>

9
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,966
<i>Especially those</i>
<i>who've never been in one.</i>

10
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,532
<i>We like things nice and simple,</i>

11
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,937
<i>good and evil, heroes and villains.</i>

12
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,833
<i>There's always plenty of both.</i>

13
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:30,176
<i>Most of the time,</i>
<i>they are not who we think they are.</i>

14
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,496
Where is he?

15
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,695
Where is he?

16
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,375
Where... Where is he? Where is he?

17
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,538
Mr. Bradley?

18
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:07,284
Mr. B? You okay?

19
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,844
-Where is he?
-Where is who?

20
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,588
Where is he? Where did he go?
Where... Where is he?

21
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,890
All right. Just stay right here, okay?

22
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,829
I'm gonna call an ambulance.
It'll be okay.

23
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,191
Where is he?

24
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,899
<i>Most guys I knew would never talk</i>
<i>about what happened over there.</i>

25
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,340
<i>Probably 'cause they're</i>
<i>still trying to forget about it.</i>

26
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:37,747
<i>They certainly didn't</i>
<i>think of themselves as heroes.</i>

27
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,382
They died without glory.

28
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,155
Nobody has taken their pictures.

29
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,287
Only their buddies knew what they did.

30
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,297
I'd tell their folks
they died for their country.

31
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,533
I'm not sure that was it.

32
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,036
Now, there were plenty other photos
taken that day,

33
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,732
but none anybody wanted to see.

34
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,105
What we see and do in war,

35
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,769
the cruelty, is unbelievable.

36
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,082
But somehow
we gotta make some sense of it.

37
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,744
To do that,
we need a easy to understand truth

38
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,983
and damn few words.

39
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,851
Film's ruined.

40
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,295
I don't know. This one looks all right.

41
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,100
<i>And if you can get a picture...</i>

42
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:40,476
<i>Now, the right picture</i>
<i>can win or lose a war.</i>

43
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,010
You're gonna want to see this.

44
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,482
Look at Vietnam.

45
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,917
The picture of that
South Vietnamese officer

46
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:52,185
blowing that fella's brains
out of the side of his head, whammo!

47
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,717
That was it.

48
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,992
The war was lost.

49
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,162
We just hung around
trying to pretend it wasn't.

50
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,435
<i>Took a lot of other pictures that day.</i>
<i>None of them made a difference.</i>

51
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,006
Thanks. Appreciate it.

52
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,516
<i>Sounds ridiculous, but it happened.</i>

53
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,125
<i>Country was bankrupt.</i>

54
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,891
<i>People were becoming</i>
<i>cynical and tired of war.</i>

55
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,270
Oh, my Lord, that's Harlon!

56
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,406
Where?

57
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,441
Right there.
Planting that flag, that's your brother.

58
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,817
Ma, all you can see is his behind.

59
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:59,790
And that's his. I powdered
and diapered it, I know my son.

60
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,684
That's him. Go get your father.

61
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,992
Daddy, Ma's got a picture
of Harlon's keister in the paper.

62
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,727
You watch your mouth, young man.

63
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,072
Thank you.

64
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:31,156
<i>One photo, almost all on its own,</i>
<i>turned that around.</i>

65
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,758
It's on the front page
of every major paper.

66
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,991
Over 200 dailies and they're
all flooded with requests for prints.

67
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,866
I think we might have found it.

68
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,818
<i>Corpsman!</i>

69
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,282
<i>Corpsman!</i>

70
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,028
Corpsman!

71
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,120
-I gotta go get him.
-Oh, no, you don't.

72
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,563
Iggy, I gotta go.

73
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,758
I have a whole different theory.

74
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,701
He wants medical attention bad enough,
he'll come to us.

75
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:54,035
Shut up and crawl over here,
you lazy son-of-a-bitch!

76
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,041
As soon as that flare goes out.

77
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,668
-Crap. Okay, well, I'll go with you.
-No.

78
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,041
You're actually gonna leave me here?

79
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,479
I'll be right back,
just shoot some people. I gotta go.

80
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,890
Oh, God.

81
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,121
Okay, it's okay.

82
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,461
Don't touch them. Don't touch them.

83
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,525
Get your hands out of there.
Let me do that. I'll do it, okay?

84
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,094
Don't look. Keep your head back.
Keep your eyes on me.

85
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,972
All right, look at me.
I'll get it. I'll take care of it.

86
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,170
We'll get this bandage on you.
We'll get you taken care of.

87
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,407
And we'll get you down to the bottom,
all right?

88
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:37,608
Look, you're gonna be fine.

89
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,115
It's okay.

90
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,716
I'll do that. I'll do that.

91
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,017
Here, put some pressure on that.

92
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,082
Put your hands on top
and put some pressure on it.

93
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,127
Keep your head back. Keep breathing.

94
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,629
Keep looking at me, all right?
Just keep looking at...

95
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,428
Doc.

96
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,135
Help me.

97
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,871
Help me.

98
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,828
All right. Okay.

99
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,931
How's that feel?

100
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,670
-It feels good.
-It does? All right.

101
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,471
-Good.
-All right.

102
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:42,106
I'm gonna go get a stretcher and get
you down to the beach. I'll be right back.

103
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,614
I'm all right.

104
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,774
Go and help someone who's hurt.

105
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,717
All right. Hold on there.

106
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,766
-Where'd he go?
-Who?

107
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:06,134
The guy who was right here, Ignatowski.
Where did he go?

108
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,867
-I think you jumped in the wrong hole.
-I didn't jump in the wrong hole!

109
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,705
He was right here,
now where the hell is he?

110
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,671
lggy!

111
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,808
lggy!

112
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,180
You shut up. You want every Jap
on the island shooting at us?

113
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,684
lggy!

114
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,602
Holy shit.

115
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,505
They expect us to climb this?

116
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,408
Or something just like it.

117
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,252
So, where you think they're sending us?

118
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,956
I think it's the desert, Franklin.

119
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,695
Well, that makes no sense at all.

120
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,758
Well, it's just military psychology.

121
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,668
They always train you for the desert
on a volcano.

122
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,775
Now you're just having fun with me.

123
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,941
Harlon, take your men right.

124
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,604
-Watch for Bedouins.
-Yes, sir.

125
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,673
-What's a Bedouin?
-It's a guy with a camel.

126
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,886
Well, Jeez Louise,
maybe we are going to the desert.

127
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:35,057
Now, you tilt that to the right, but
what if the bullet comes from the left?

128
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:39,421
Bullets don't come from the left.
You know any left-handed Japs?

129
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,192
That makes about as much sense
as you showering with your shoes on.

130
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,430
You don't even know why you do it,
do you?

131
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,734
'Cause I don't tell you
mean I don't know?

132
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,866
You do it 'cause Mike does it.

133
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,866
I'll ask him.

134
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,402
So you cut hair back home?

135
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,572
Some.

136
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,414
Training to be a barber, are you, Doc?

137
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,816
No, I just studied it a little.

138
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,520
But not in barber school?

139
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,116
Nope.

140
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,658
-Gosh.
-Let me guess, Hayes is winning.

141
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,096
Chief, I had very little to do
with Sitting Bull's death,

142
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,725
so maybe you could stop
taking it out on me.

143
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:19,567
Different tribe. The Pimas fought
on the side of the white man.

144
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,129
-See, now that's smart.
-That is smart.

145
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,336
Yeah. Worked real good for us.

146
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,038
Good luck, fellas.

147
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,013
Hey, good night, Lindberg.

148
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,983
Dead bodies.
He cuts hair on dead bodies.

149
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,877
What? Even I knew that.

150
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,223
-Who's in?
-Oh, I'm in. I'm in.

151
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,451
It must be a lot easier with them
not moving around and all.

152
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,122
-There's that.
-Yeah.

153
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,591
You know what I been thinking?

154
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,602
Well, they been telling us
we need to buddy up

155
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,230
and I think we'd make
pretty good buddies.

156
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:55,864
And how do you figure that?

157
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,933
Well, you know,
in that we have a lot in common.

158
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,143
So, why do you cut dead people's hair,
anyway?

159
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,740
I'm studying to work in a funeral home.

160
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,353
You tell a lot of people that?

161
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:14,188
You actually chose the Marines
because they got the best uniform?

162
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,356
No sense being a hero
if you don't look like one.

163
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,727
Jacks.

164
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,595
Queens.

165
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,932
Shit.

166
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,131
Do anything on that reservation
but play cards, Chief?

167
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,610
All right, listen up,
you sorry bunch of leathernecks!

168
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,771
We practice going
over the side tomorrow

169
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,339
which means we ain't long
for this piece of rock.

170
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,884
All right!

171
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,355
One more thing, any man who doesn't
have his masturbation papers in order

172
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:45,754
better get them signed by tomorrow
night or he ain't going overseas.

173
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,918
-I got mine already.
-Oh, yeah. I'm square.

174
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,518
Wait. Why am I just hearing about this?

175
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,258
That's horseshit, Franklin. I don't have
to repeat everything twice for you.

176
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,529
No, I didn't hear nothing
about no masturbating papers.

177
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,570
Heard they were running short.

178
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,631
You know, nobody tells me nothing.
That's real nice, guys.

179
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,835
All right, get your ass over
to the officer in charge of records.

180
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,741
Maybe he got some more left.

181
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,313
-Leave your smokes. I'll play for you.
-Thanks, Mike.

182
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,647
Listen, he calls you an idiot,
you take it like a man, okay?

183
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,687
Just do not leave without signing them.

184
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,188
-I appreciate it, Sergeant.
-You got it.

185
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,956
What the hell happened to your hair,
Rene?

186
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,592
Look like a goddamn corpse.

187
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:37,601
Three points of contact on that rope
at all times.

188
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,771
Next four. Over the side.

189
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,578
Let's go. Keep moving.

190
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,308
Next four, over the side.

191
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,285
Just keep your eye
on the guy below you.

192
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,685
That's all you gotta look at.

193
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,814
Watch me, Doc, just watch me.

194
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,520
Keep three points of contact
on the rope at all times.

195
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,028
You see? No big thing.

196
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,866
Just one step at a time and keep
your hands on the vertical rope.

197
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,370
Remember, once you're in the boat
move away from the rope.

198
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,430
Just make sure you keep three points
of contact on the rope.

199
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,634
I got him!

200
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,404
All right, get that man out of the water.

201
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,945
Give me a hand.

202
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,174
Grab his pack.

203
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,340
Don't worry about him, Doc.

204
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,577
All right, quit skylarking! Keep it moving!

205
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:20,983
He'll be fine.

206
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,817
Our target, Island X,

207
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,224
is an ugly, smelly,
dirty little scab of rock called lwo Jima.

208
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,225
It means "Sulfur Island,"
which accounts for the smell.

209
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,535
Looks sort of like a burnt pork chop,
you ask me.

210
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,201
After 20 straight days of bombing

211
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,638
you won't find a blade of grass
or a twig on it.

212
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,233
It wasn't that pretty to start with.

213
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,471
Captain?

214
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,140
lwo's just five-and-a-half miles long,
two-and-a-half wide.

215
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,343
There's a lump down at the bottom.
That's Mount Suribachi.

216
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,512
On the maps in front of you
the island is white.

217
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,145
Not much of it.

218
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,724
The black dots represent
known enemy emplacements.

219
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,159
Coastal defense guns,
dual-mount dual-purpose guns,

220
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,718
covered artillery emplacements.

221
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,992
Rifle pits, foxholes, antitank guns

222
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,934
machine guns, blockhouses, pillboxes,
and earth-covered structures.

223
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,836
I don't see any barracks
or any other structures.

224
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,373
That's right.

225
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,306
And we still don't know why.

226
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,174
Now, this isn't just any island to them.

227
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:24,579
This isn't Tarawa, Guam, Tinian,
or Saipan.

228
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,811
This is Japanese soil, sacred ground.

229
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,084
Twelve thousand Japanese defenders
in eight square miles.

230
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,647
They will not leave politely, gentlemen.

231
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,819
It's up to us to convince them.

232
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,160
The 28th will land here at Green Beach.

233
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,257
The 8th Ammo Company
will land here to re-supply.

234
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,302
The Suribachi's guns
are the biggest problem.

235
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,065
They can hit any point on the island.

236
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,504
We're sitting ducks
until we take them out.

237
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,132
That's our job.

238
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,202
We cut across the island, right at the
base, slit its throat, lop off its head.

239
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,837
And we take that mountain.

240
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,576
We take that mountain,
we take their big guns.

241
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,379
We take their eyes.

242
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,623
<i>Okay, I'm heading in. Follow me.</i>

243
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,329
<i>Let's put a good show on</i>
<i>for the Marines.</i>

244
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,565
<i>Close it up.</i>
<i>Take it right down to the deck.</i>

245
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,221
Yeah, boys!

246
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,521
Man overboard portside!

247
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,732
See him?

248
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,670
Throw me a line!

249
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,370
He's right there.

250
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,705
-Where is he?
-Watch out, watch out, watch out.

251
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,775
Hawaii's that way!

252
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,778
Just keep paddling, Mac,
we'll catch you on the way back!

253
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,915
Hold on, they're gonna lower a raft!

254
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,685
They're not gonna stop.

255
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,855
What?

256
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,333
None of them are. They can't.

257
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,642
So much for "No man left behind."

258
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,643
-Sir.
-Come on in.

259
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,044
Look, I've had to make
a few other changes.

260
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,023
I'm promoting you to platoon sergeant.

261
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,355
-Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
-You bet.

262
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:54,264
Trouble is, I already told my men
I'd see them through this.

263
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,494
That your
James Cagney impersonation?

264
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,433
'Cause I've heard better.

265
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,132
Well, I'll keep practicing, then.

266
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,971
Look, this isn't
your first time through this.

267
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,977
-You don't need to prove anything.
-No, sir.

268
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,212
You're not the best sergeant
I've ever had,

269
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,273
you're just the best one
that's still walking.

270
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,148
-Block's a good man.
-Yes, sir, he is.

271
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,380
The men know him, he can step right in.

272
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,482
You know,
I have actually thought this through.

273
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,552
Platoon sergeant puts you further away
from the bullets.

274
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,098
I already gave them my word, sir.

275
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,066
I told them I'd bring them all home
to their mothers

276
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:32,069
which means I already lied to half
of them. Can't lie to the rest.

277
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,299
-How are your men?
-They'll do fine.

278
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,275
Except maybe Gagnon.

279
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,444
Our own Tyrone Power?

280
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:49,252
Yes, sir. He's a good man, just might be
better use further back from the lines.

281
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,080
I'll use him as a runner.

282
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,822
All right. Thank you, sir.

283
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,555
Now get out of here.

284
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,304
Hear the good news, Doc?
We're going in with the first waves.

285
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,432
Hey, you do that again
I'll take your head off!

286
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,204
Fucking dominoes.

287
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,779
Iggy, have you ever heard news
you considered to be bad?

288
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,475
The first ones off the ship, Doc.

289
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,644
Means we don't go over
the side of the ship.

290
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,484
We hop on a tractor,
they drive us right there.

291
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,786
Oh, shit, that is good news.

292
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,758
You see? What'd I tell you?

293
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,893
What's going on?

294
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,220
Look at that.

295
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,190
We're killing them!

296
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,097
We're killing them, Doc.

297
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,422
I was promised 10 days of shelling.

298
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,660
You're giving me three
and saying that's the best you can do?

299
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,930
I don't give a shit! My men hit
that beach with less than 10

300
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,767
and I'll be taking them home
to their mamas in buckets!

301
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,067
Yeah, I know exactly why.

302
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,942
Because every Navy man with
a scrambled egg on his chest

303
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:58,005
wants to offload us here
and sail to Japan

304
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,381
so they can be there for the big finish,

305
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,555
tell their kids they captured
the Emperor all by themselves.

306
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:08,650
Well, you aren't going to Japan
unless we take this piece of shit island!

307
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,220
These little pricks are dug in!

308
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:18,961
Okay, appreciate that, Jim.
Three days is a fucking beautiful thing.

309
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,202
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?

310
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,041
I'm okay.

311
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,713
Sharpen your knife or bayonet?

312
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,650
Jesus, lggy, just leave me alone,
all right?

313
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:38,611
How about you guys? Knife? Bayonet?
Kick in the ass?

314
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:42,058
How about you, Doc?
Sharpen your knife?

315
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,852
You sharpened it three times already.

316
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,728
Well, then I better make sure
I didn't nick it.

317
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,667
Good man, Doc.

318
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,734
-Hey, Doc.
-Yeah.

319
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,269
When we land, try not to wave
this kit around too much.

320
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:04,440
They got sharpshooters
that are trained to look for them.

321
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,541
And they know that
if they take out a corpsman

322
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,086
another dozen Marines
will die unattended. All right?

323
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,485
Okay, Mike.

324
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,685
Yeah, right there.

325
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:51,958
Close the damn door. For God's sake.

326
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,157
Yeah, like that's gonna help.

327
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,303
That your girlfriend, Chief?

328
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:06,903
Bet she's a pretty
damn good-looking squaw.

329
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:10,505
Bet you're missing her,
and that little wigwam of yours.

330
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,927
<i>Welcome, all Marines off lwo Jima.</i>

331
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,529
<i>We have a long-time wait...</i>

332
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,895
It's what they do to prisoners,

333
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,071
-at least the lucky ones.
-Jesus.

334
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,943
If I were you, cowpokes, I wouldn't think
about waving a white bandanna.

335
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:44,539
<i>Poor Marines, so far from home</i>
<i>for no good reason.</i>

336
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:49,343
<i>Think of your girls back home,</i>
<i>waiting for you.</i>

337
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,413
<i>But a girl cannot stay home every night.</i>

338
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,654
<i>So who do you think</i>
<i>they're with tonight?</i>

339
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:01,398
<i>And will she let him kiss her?</i>
<i>And will he comfort her at your funeral?</i>

340
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:06,236
<i>This sweet music is to make you think</i>
<i>of your girls back home</i>

341
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,397
<i>who are missing you.</i>

342
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:11,374
<i>This is all for now.</i>
<i>I'll see you tomorrow night.</i>

343
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,239
Gunners!

344
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,089
Move, let's go!
Let's go, get up on the berm!

345
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,755
Gunners!

346
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,572
We're clear!

347
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,240
Get up the berm!

348
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,745
Baker Company, move out!

349
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,448
-Seen Second Platoon?
-I don't see them.

350
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,047
First Squad, move it out!

351
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,785
God, this place reeks.

352
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,804
-Go, go, go!
-Move out!

353
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:35,835
Go, go, go, go! Go, go! Go! Go, go!
Drop your packs! Go!

354
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,346
All clear!

355
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,485
-Jesus, you needed some exercise?
-He got lost.

356
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,320
A hundred landing craft heading
for one beach and this guy gets lost.

357
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,417
Now I'm glad we did.
Jesus, what a mess.

358
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,562
Any theories why they ain't shooting?

359
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,791
It's getting on my nerves.

360
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,926
Maybe they're all dead.

361
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,429
What do you think, Doc?
You think they're all dead?

362
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,891
Mike, take six men
and bring that gun onto the beach.

363
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:31,299
Second Platoon, let's move out!
Stay down. Come on.

364
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,566
Move! Move!

365
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,144
-Get down!
-Take cover!

366
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:15,776
Move out!

367
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,629
Cover fire! Pour it on!

368
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:47,605
Ray, shift your fire to the right, now!

369
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,215
Corpsman!

370
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,523
I'm gonna sling your arm
and then I'll give you a shot for the pain!

371
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,827
Move, move! Off the beach!

372
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,559
Take cover!

373
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,477
You got a girl back home, Marine?

374
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,214
We're gonna make sure
she sees you, all right?

375
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,779
I need pressure on this wound!

376
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,996
Where's the fire coming from?

377
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,506
Where are they?

378
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,576
Look for a flash, shoot at it!

379
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,081
Let's go, let...

380
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,200
Twelve o'clock, take out the bunker!

381
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,703
You're over!

382
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,348
Third Squad, forward! Move!

383
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,696
Where are they, sir?

384
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,894
We got ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock, pillbox! Sergeant!

385
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,099
-Sergeant! I think I can clear that out.
-What?

386
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,801
All right, you go. Here.

387
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,605
Take these. Check your weapon.

388
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,578
Yeah? Go! Cover!

389
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,046
Cover him!

390
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,555
Cover, cover!

391
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,619
Son-of-a-bitch.

392
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,327
Let's go! Go!

393
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,768
Move it out!

394
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,635
Go, go, go!

395
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,306
Down, down, down!

396
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:56,396
It's clear.

397
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,866
Good work.

398
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,902
I thought you said it was clear!

399
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,344
It was!

400
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:18,384
Shit, I guess they're not in there
firing at us then.

401
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,191
Lindberg!

402
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:22,385
Yeah!

403
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,950
Light it up!

404
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,360
I'll cover you, Ice!

405
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:32,335
Don't cover shit! There's already
enough people shooting!

406
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,497
One bullet and this thing goes up
like a Roman candle!

407
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,632
Go! Shift fire!

408
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,970
Shift your fire!

409
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,409
Go, go! Shift your fire!

410
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,942
Shift your fire!

411
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,352
Go! Move it out!

412
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,245
Hit the deck!
Stay down! Wait for support!

413
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,784
Is this a bad battle or what?

414
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,915
It's a fucking slaughter.

415
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,564
Christ Jesus!

416
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,379
Get a machine gun team
set up over here, now!

417
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,186
Thank God! Tanks!

418
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:59,189
Runner! Get those tanks up here!

419
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,287
Oh, shit.

420
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,191
Get down!

421
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:07,060
Corporal, watch your left flank!

422
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:10,396
Let's go without them!
Move out! Move out!

423
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,928
lggy, you gotta lift your side,
he's gonna roll off.

424
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,430
Got it, Doc!

425
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:45,932
Incoming!

426
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,835
Move, move, move, move!

427
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,262
Keep moving!

428
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,003
Get that LVT up on the beach!

429
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:28,709
Keep moving!

430
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,979
You're next, pal,
we're getting you out of here.

431
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,822
Move it!

432
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,073
Great news.

433
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:04,413
Maybe if you live up on Camp Tarawa,
'cause that's where we're headed.

434
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,314
Not you and me.

435
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,910
Captain Severance asked me
who else was in that picture,

436
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,750
and Christ if I could remember,

437
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,916
but it was Mike and Doc and Franklin
and me and Hank Hansen

438
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,722
but I just remembered,
you were there, too.

439
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,290
I wasn't there.

440
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,892
'Course you were.

441
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,438
Neither was Hank.
He raised the first flag.

442
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,303
It was Harlon Block that raised that one.

443
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,207
Shit. I told them it was Hank.

444
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,741
You weren't there, Mr. Smart Ass,
how'd you know it was Harlon?

445
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,510
-You tell them it was me?
-No. Like I said, I just remembered.

446
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,574
Good, keep your mouth shut.

447
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,317
They know there was somebody else,
you can see it in the picture.

448
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,480
Then pick someone dead.

449
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,353
They don't want somebody dead,
you dumb redskin,

450
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,825
they want to ship us back to the States.

451
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,057
What did I tell you?

452
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,056
I wasn't there.

453
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,623
-You hear?
-All right.

454
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,063
Just settle down.

455
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:04,435
-I'm not going anywhere.
-You're not going anywhere.

456
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:42,207
Who the hell says?

457
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,114
This is horseshit.

458
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,349
You wounded, son?

459
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,918
No, sir.

460
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,655
Well, did you take out a nest of Japs
butt-naked with your bare hands?

461
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,789
'Cause if I'm gonna give up my seat
to a hero

462
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,731
he better have
a good goddamn story to tell.

463
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,166
No, sir.

464
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,865
Then enjoy it, 'cause they'll forget you
before Christmas.

465
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,190
The sixth man, you got a name?

466
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,327
Sorry, still don't remember.

467
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:43,032
It's a damn shame, 'cause I promised
the Major you'd know who it was.

468
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,234
Fact, you not knowing
throws a doubt on you

469
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,573
being one of the flag-raisers yourself.

470
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,478
Since no one wants to be embarrassed,
the moment you land

471
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,413
they'll turn you around,
ship you off to Okinawa

472
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,179
in time to meet your buddies
on the beach.

473
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,881
So, why don't you stop screwing
with me? Give me a damn name.

474
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,598
Gangway! Gangway!
Let's go, let's go! Gangway!

475
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:23,272
Where the hell is that son-of-a-bitch?
Hayes! Hayes?

476
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,544
Hayes, get your red ass over here!

477
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,481
Make me look like I don't know
what my own men are doing

478
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,712
with a flag the size
of my mother's house?

479
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,721
God damn it, Ira,
you shouldn't have lied to me.

480
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,087
You made me look like
a complete asshole.

481
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,956
We're gonna miss you around here.
Good luck.

482
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,033
Now your name's in the paper, too.

483
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,535
Just heard your doctor say
we're postponing your operation.

484
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,704
You're being shipped back
to the mainland.

485
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,715
<i>Everybody who saw that picture</i>
<i>thought planting the flag meant victory.</i>

486
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,514
<i>That's all they wanted to know. Victory.</i>

487
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,788
<i>Within a few weeks of that picture being</i>
<i>taken, half the men in it were dead.</i>

488
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,693
Mrs. Hansen! Mrs. Hansen!
Did you know Hank was a hero?

489
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,890
-Are you proud of him, Mrs. Hansen?
-What was he like as a boy?

490
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,057
Look this way, please, ma'am.

491
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,361
What do you have to say
about your son?

492
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,964
<i>But somehow being a part of it</i>
<i>meant something.</i>

493
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:28,473
<i>Looking at it, you could believe</i>
<i>their sacrifice was not a waste.</i>

494
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,918
Yeah, I might have thought
that was Harlon, too.

495
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,146
It is.

496
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,090
Belle, their names are right here.
It's not him.

497
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,790
And he would be alive
and sitting right here if it wasn't for you.

498
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:52,127
You think about that
when you look at his picture, Ed.

499
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,936
And I need to rush home and change

500
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,874
because there's the Governor's banquet
and then there's the parade.

501
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:09,174
Imagine, the Governor is coming here
to meet us.

502
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,077
Now, I'm wearing blue so, if...

503
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,378
-Are you going to change?
-<i>We interrupt this program to bring you</i>

504
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,974
<i>a special news bulletin</i>
<i>from CBS World News.</i>

505
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:19,079
<i>A press association has just announced</i>
<i>that President Roosevelt is dead.</i>

506
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,716
<i>The President died</i>

507
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:26,161
<i>All we know so far is that the President</i>

508
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,762
<i>Further updates every hour.</i>

511
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,436
Hello?

512
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,267
Yes. Of course.

513
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:43,172
No, we understand. It wouldn't be right.

514
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,546
Thank you.

515
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,550
Here he is, gentlemen.
Senator Boyd, Senator Robson.

516
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:57,321
Senator Haddigan. I'd like you to meet
Private First Class Ira Hayes.

517
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,328
Damn good to meet you.

518
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,762
Proud to make your acquaintance, son.

519
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,730
Sorry?

520
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,370
That's Pima Indian talk, boy,
don't you know your own language?

521
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,071
Took forever to memorize
the damn gibberish.

522
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:18,672
Sorry, I've been away from
the reservation too long, Senator.

523
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:25,919
-Doc.
-Ira.

524
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,958
<i>And now, the heroes of lwo Jima!</i>

525
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:32,291
-That's you.
-Go, go, go, go. Go.

526
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,057
<i>Please welcome</i>

527
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:38,394
<i>Navy Corpsman John "Doc" Bradley,</i>

528
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:43,094
<i>Private First Class Ira Hayes,</i>

529
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:48,434
<i>Private First Class Rene Gagnon!</i>

530
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,874
Holy shit.

531
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:24,447
Come in, come in, come in.
Bud Gurber, Treasury Department.

532
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,142
-Rene Gagnon.
-Bud Gurber.

533
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,878
-You showing the boys the sights?
-We saw a hell of a ball game.

534
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,250
That's great.
The bar's there, help yourself.

535
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,289
I got some briefing sheets for you here,

536
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,188
just some simple things
we want you to say.

537
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,751
Mostly, "Buy bonds,"
can't say that too often.

538
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,990
Itineraries, those are changing
every couple minutes.

539
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,555
Everybody wants to meet you guys.

540
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:47,001
I got women sending up envelopes
with stockings in them,

541
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,301
notes written in lipstick. We won't
mention that to the press, am I right?

542
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,842
Have a drink, for Christ's sake.

543
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,276
My God, what you boys
must have seen over there.

544
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,040
I've been watching the newsreels.

545
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,742
Jesus Christ, that was a fight and a half.

546
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,710
So, we got a hell of a lot of money
to raise, not a lot of time.

547
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,847
White House tomorrow,
then we trot you over

548
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,482
to shake hands with
a couple of hundred Congressmen

549
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,083
who won't pull a penny
out of their pockets.

550
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,422
Politicians and actors.

551
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:12,587
You put them in a restaurant together,

552
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,563
they'd die of old age
before picking up the check.

553
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:17,566
Then New York City, Times Square,

554
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:20,626
dinners with various hoi polloi,
then Chicago...

555
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,604
Who are these "Gold Star Mothers"?

556
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,904
That's what we're calling the mothers
of the dead flag-raisers.

557
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:27,841
You present each mother with a flag,

558
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,436
they say a few words,
people will shit money.

559
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,038
It'll be so moving.

560
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,811
But this says Hank Hansen's mom.

561
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:37,353
Lovely woman. She knows how close
you and her son were.

562
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,820
He wrote home about you.

563
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,449
She is very, very much
looking forward to meeting you.

564
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,618
Hank wasn't in the picture.

565
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,889
Sorry?

566
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,890
Hank didn't raise that flag.

567
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,563
He raised the other one, the real flag.

568
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,162
The what? The real...
The real flag? There's a real flag?

569
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,797
Yeah, ours was the replacement flag.

570
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,240
We put it up when they took
the other one down.

571
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,073
Am I the only one getting a headache
here? You know about this?

572
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,170
It was after it was already in the papers.

573
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:05,681
The mothers had already
been told, but...

574
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,877
That's it, that's beautiful.
Yeah, that's beautiful.

575
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,112
Yeah, why tell me?

576
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:12,849
I'm only the guy that has to explain it
to 150 million Americans.

577
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,652
Who is in the goddamn picture?

578
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,693
Are any of you guys
in the goddamn picture?

579
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,660
Yeah, we're in the goddamn picture.

580
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,823
Six guys raising a flag over lwo Jima.
Victory is ours.

581
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,298
You're three of them, right?

582
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,461
This was the fifth day, sir.
The battle went on for 35 more.

583
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,767
Well, what'd you do, raise a goddamn
flag every time you stopped for lunch?

584
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,432
Can I hit this guy?

585
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:33,942
You know what, I don't give a shit,
you're in the picture,

586
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,571
you raised the flag,
that's the story we're selling, boys.

587
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:40,344
Are you deaf? Hank isn't in the picture.
Harlon is in the picture.

588
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,112
Well, who the fuck is Harlon?

589
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:46,417
Harlon Block. That's whose mother
should be here if anyone's should be.

590
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:50,759
You know, I think this whole damn thing
is a farce, you ask me.

591
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,707
You know what they're calling
this bond drive? The Mighty Seventh.

592
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,807
They might've called it the

593
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,647
"We're Flat Fucking Broke
And Can't Even Afford Bullets

594
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,346
"So We're Begging For Your Pennies"
bond drive,

595
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:20,254
but it didn't have quite the ring.
They could've called it that, though,

596
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,315
because the last four bond drives
came up so short

597
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,485
we just printed money instead.

598
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,722
Ask any smart boy on Wall Street,
he'll tell you

599
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,960
our dollar is next to worthless,
we borrowed so much.

600
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,866
And nobody is lending any more.
Ships aren't being built.

601
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:36,736
Tanks aren't being built. Machine guns,
bazookas, hand grenades, zip.

602
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,901
You think this is a farce?
You want to go back to your buddies?

603
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,445
Well, stuff some rocks in your pockets
before you get on the plane

604
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:44,810
because that's all we got left
to throw at the Japanese.

605
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,315
And don't be surprised if your plane
doesn't make it off the runway

606
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,113
because the fuel dumps are empty.

607
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,916
And our good friends, the Arabs,
are only taking bullion.

608
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,321
If we don't raise $14 billion,

609
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:58,088
and that's million with a "B,"
this war is over by the end of the month.

610
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,652
We make a deal with the Japanese,
we give whatever they want

611
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,631
and we come home,
because you've seen them fight,

612
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,065
and they sure as shit ain't giving up.

613
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,830
$14 billion.

614
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:10,100
The last three drives
didn't make that much all together.

615
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,906
People on the street corners,

616
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:17,208
they looked at this picture
and they took hope.

617
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,373
Don't ask me why,
I think it's a crappy picture myself.

618
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,917
You can't even see your faces.

619
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:25,819
But it said we can win this war,
are winning this war,

620
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:28,187
we just need you to dig a little deeper.

621
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:29,919
They want to give us that money.

622
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,984
No, they want to give it to you.

623
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,860
But you, you don't want to ask for it.
You don't want to give them hope.

624
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:38,264
You want to explain about
this person and that flag.

625
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:40,994
Well, that's your choice.

626
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:45,572
Because if we admit we made a
mistake, that's all anybody'll talk about

627
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,542
and that will be that.

628
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,414
Gentlemen.

629
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,157
Mr. President, here they are.

630
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,217
-Well, hello. Good to see you.
-Mr. President.

631
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:06,785
Darn good to see you, boys.

632
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:09,798
Heard you had a hell of a fight
on your hands out there, hell of a fight.

633
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:10,992
Yes, sir.

634
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,595
Ira, you're off the Gila River Reservation
in Arizona, am I right?

635
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:16,468
Yes, Mr. President.

636
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,101
Being an Indian,
you are a truer American than any of us.

637
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,976
Bet your people are proud to see you
wear that uniform.

638
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:24,445
Very proud, sir.

639
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:26,074
They should be.

640
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:29,846
Well, I want to thank you for coming all
this way to Washington to help us out.

641
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,751
You fought for a mountain in the Pacific

642
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:34,791
now we need you to fight
for a mountain of cash.

643
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,520
-And I don't expect you'll let us down.
-No, sir.

644
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,459
Good. Go get it.

645
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:41,754
That's the end of this ceremony.

646
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:46,269
Let's take a look at this famous photo
over here, see if I can pick you out.

647
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:48,736
My gosh. There you are.

648
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:02,208
Boys. Boys, this one's on me.
To those who can't be with us.

649
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,181
Yes, sir.

650
00:52:06,823 --> 00:52:10,657
Excuse me, Mr. Gagnon.
May we have your autograph?

651
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,557
I suppose.

652
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,561
And your name is?

653
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,761
I don't know about you,
but I get the impression

654
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,598
I'm drinking with the wrong heroes.

655
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:24,663
You're such a hero.
I feel honored to be in your presence.

656
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,734
That's just not true.

657
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:32,880
That's professional work.
Here, to professionals.

658
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,090
Here they are. You're the guys
in the photograph, right?

659
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,755
I heard you were on the train.

660
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,731
Let me shake your hands,
John Tennack.

661
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,528
John Bradley.

662
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,399
These boys are with me, Harvard
and Yale types, didn't fight a lick.

663
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:56,200
Pappies all rich sons-of-bitches.

664
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,707
Boys, shake hands
with some real war heroes.

665
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,470
Excuse me for one moment.

666
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,604
You can buy them a drink
while you're at it.

667
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,614
That's right. Drinks for these men
all the way around.

668
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,276
And you're the other one, aren't you?
John Tennack, Tennack Homes.

669
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,410
-Rene Gagnon.
-Pleased to meet you.

670
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:13,183
Have a drink, come on.
And here's my card.

671
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:15,121
Listen to me, Rene,

672
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,922
when you get finished
being famous you come see me

673
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,827
because if you can sell bonds,
you can sell homes.

674
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:24,162
Now, they're not gonna build homes
anymore, they're gonna deliver them.

675
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:26,031
-You heard of prefab homes?
-No, sir.

676
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:30,095
Well, you will. And you hang on to that
card and you come see me, you hear?

677
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,970
-All right?
-Certainly will.

678
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,180
All right.

679
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,587
This sure takes it, huh, Doc?

680
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:55,996
If Mike and the guys could see us.

681
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,760
Yeah, they'd hardly believe it,
would they?

682
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,638
Harlon!

683
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:08,242
Franklin!

684
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,315
Can you imagine Franklin

685
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,416
on this train

686
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:23,582
eating at the dining car
with all the silver?

687
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:30,125
We shouldn't be here, Doc.

688
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:09,400
<i>There's gonna be a Hallelujah Day</i>

689
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:13,306
<i>When the boys</i>
<i>have all come home to stay</i>

690
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:17,278
<i>And a million bands begin to play</i>

691
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:20,874
<i>We'll be dancing the Victory Polka</i>

692
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,886
<i>And when we've lit the torch of liberty</i>

693
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,445
<i>In each blacked-out land across the sea</i>

694
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:30,925
Ira! Hey, Ira!
We heard the picture was posed!

695
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,018
What?

696
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,325
We heard you posed the picture!

697
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:35,659
Hey, Doc!

698
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,070
We're bigger than life, Doc!

699
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:47,734
<i>And we'll heave a mighty sigh</i>

700
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:51,577
<i>When each gal can kiss the boy</i>
<i>she kissed goodbye</i>

701
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:55,345
<i>And they'll come marching down</i>
<i>Fifth Avenue</i>

702
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:59,616
<i>The United Nations in review</i>

703
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:03,386
<i>When this lovely dream</i>
<i>has all come true</i>

704
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:09,524
<i>We'll be dancing the Victory Polka</i>

705
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,196
Good job.

706
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,431
Thank you.

707
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:26,973
<i>Thank you, girls!</i>

708
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,449
<i>And now,</i>

709
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:32,944
<i>here are the men</i>
<i>you've been waiting to meet,</i>

710
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,887
<i>the men in white.</i>

711
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:38,985
<i>Right behind me here,</i>
<i>the heroes of lwo Jima,</i>

712
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,498
<i>Private First Class Rene Gagnon,</i>

713
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,999
<i>Private First Class Ira Hayes,</i>

714
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,401
<i>and Navy Corpsman</i>
<i>John "Doc" Bradley!</i>

715
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,249
<i>Thank you.</i>

716
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:09,948
<i>It's good of you people to come out</i>
<i>tonight in support of the war effort.</i>

717
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:12,654
<i>We really need you to buy bonds,</i>
<i>that's for sure.</i>

718
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:15,391
<i>'Cause we can't win the war</i>
<i>without your help.</i>

719
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:19,094
<i>As far as us being the heroes</i>
<i>of lwo Jima,</i>

720
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,831
<i>that's just not the case.</i>

721
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,439
<i>We really didn't do much at all.</i>

722
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,099
Especially him.

723
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,333
<i>Especially me.</i>

724
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,737
<i>I was just a runner. That's it.</i>

725
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:34,779
<i>We put up a flag.</i>

726
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:38,685
<i>The pole we attached it to was heavy,</i>
<i>so it took a number of us.</i>

727
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,053
<i>We had our picture taken doing it.</i>

728
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,856
<i>The real heroes are dead on that island.</i>

729
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:49,957
<i>And we'd appreciate it if you bought</i>
<i>bonds in honor of them. Thank you.</i>

730
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,442
Jump on any grenades, Ira?

731
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:13,214
Take out any machine gun nests
I missed?

732
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,757
At least I fired my weapon.

733
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,156
All right, knock it off.

734
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:19,161
You hit anything
or were you too drunk then, too?

735
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:20,321
What?

736
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:23,057
Guys! Come on!

737
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,464
Stop it. Knock it off.

738
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:50,055
<i>The tall man with the high hat</i>
<i>will be coming down your way</i>

739
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:53,289
<i>Get your savings out</i>
<i>when you hear him shout</i>

740
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,831
<i>"Any bonds today?"</i>

741
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:58,834
<i>Any bonds today?</i>

742
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:01,393
<i>Bonds of freedom that's what I'm selling</i>

743
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:02,802
<i>Any bonds today?</i>

744
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:06,239
Rene, right here.
Sit between these two boys.

745
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,640
<i>Here comes the freedom man</i>

746
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:14,775
<i>Asking you to buy</i>
<i>a share of freedom today</i>

747
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,084
<i>...for us and they need our help.</i>

748
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:24,550
<i>And, if you think about it,</i>
<i>I think you'll realize</i>

749
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:29,564
<i>that buying more bonds</i>
<i>is not just the right thing to do</i>

750
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,732
<i>but the only thing to do.</i>

751
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:36,395
<i>Yes, this war has gone on too long.</i>

752
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:41,543
<i>We have given too many lives.</i>
<i>And its cost...</i>

753
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,943
-Chocolate or strawberry, sir?
-Strawberry.

754
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,379
<i>...has been far too high.</i>

755
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,349
<i>But if we waver now,</i>

756
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:53,185
<i>if we don't dig deep and give more</i>
<i>than we think we can</i>

757
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:56,316
<i>then those sacrifices would be wasted...</i>

758
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:57,791
Chocolate or strawberry, sir?

759
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,420
<i>...and those lives lost in vain.</i>

760
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:42,188
Let's move! Go, go!

761
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,920
Easy Six, this is Easy Two, over.
Where the hell are our tanks?

762
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,549
Stuck in the sand.
Captain says you're to go without them.

763
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:10,922
Christ.

764
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:14,361
That's real good work
you're doing there, Rene.

765
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,125
All right, prepare to move out.
Pass the word.

766
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:20,965
Second Platoon! Move! Move! Move!

767
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:24,404
All right, Second Platoon, on your feet!
Let's move out!

768
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:25,805
Jackass.

769
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,467
Let's move out!

770
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:32,043
Go, go! Move, move, move!

771
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,350
Corpsman!

772
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,824
Corpsman!

773
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,202
Second Platoon, move out!

774
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,235
Doc!

775
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,377
Doc, get out of there!

776
