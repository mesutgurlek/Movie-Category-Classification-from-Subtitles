What's the plan, General?

316
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,909
Well, using the Reaper,
we have the ability

317
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,395
to strike a target with
considerable accuracy.

318
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,991
If you agree, Minister,

319
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,073
we could eliminate her.

320
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,673
Absolutely not!

321
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,512
Ma'am, she's a
member of Al-Shabab

322
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,273
and number four on our East
African Most Wanted list.

323
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,191
I don't care about
your list, General.

324
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,838
I came here to
witness a capture,

325
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,273
not a targeted
assassination.

327
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,358
Yes, I'm sorry, Frank.
I agree with Angela.

328
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,113
The idea was to capture
Danford, not kill her.

329
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,796
This was the mission
approved by the PM.

330
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,111
And, as Attorney General,
that is what I came here to witness.

331
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,195
We want her brought back to
this country to stand trial.

332
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,669
Right.

333
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,037

We're seeing suicide vests and a

<i>What's the plan, Katherine?</i>

360
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,949
We need to put a Hellfire
through that roof right now.

361
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,508
I told you, they came to
witness a capture, not a kill.

362
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,715
Give me a capture option.

363
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
COLONEL POWELL: <i>We no longer
have a capture option.</i>

364
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,958
Any action on the ground will
lead to an armed confrontation,

365
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,393
which we will not
be able to contain.

366
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,072
They're watching.

367
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,152
Even with the vests,
we need their approval for a strike.

368
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,040
Just tell them we've got
Danford in our sights.

369
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,674
I mean, that alone should
justify using a Hellfire.

370
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,840
The vests are just a bonus.

371
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,354
Danford's a British citizen.
They want her alive.

372
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,112
They cannot have her alive!

373
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,719
Frank, I've tracked
her for six years.

374
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,756
This is the closest
I've ever got.

375
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,993
So, we need to expand our
rules of engagement right now

376
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,672
to protect the
civilian population.

377
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,318
A Hellfire through
that roof is our

378
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,879
<i>most effective option.</i>

379
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,195
We have to know that we're
legally in the clear.

380
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,829
Yes. Yes, of course.
I'm getting into that right now.

Oh, Harold, you've been following?
Yes, ma'am.

384
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,435
So, the plan is
to put a Hellfire

385
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,675
through the roof
of that house.

386
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,591
I need legal
clearance right now.

387
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,517
A missile from the Reaper?
Yes.

388
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,397
So, this is no longer
a capture situation.

389
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,598
No. We have two suicide vests with
explosives inside that house.

390
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,319
So, can you clear
me to a higher CDE?

391
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
HAROLD: Uh...

392
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,236
Harold, this is a very time-sensitive target.
Do I have authority to strike?

393
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,992
The rules of engagement
you're operating under

394
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,960
only allow for a low
collateral damage estimate.

395
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,508
Yes, yes, and my weapons
only invoke a low CDE.

396
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,511
It's the explosives
inside that house

397
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,591
that bring it to
a potentially high CDE.

398
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,272
And since you know
the explosives are there,

399
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,555
it is incumbent upon you
to take them into account.

400
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,074
I can see a potential
legal objection.

401
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,151
Jesus! We've got two
suicide bombers

402
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,033
and three very high value
individuals inside that house!

403
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,712
And you want them off your
list, I understand that.

404
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,677
But the rules of engagement
you're operating under

not a kill scenario.

would be wise to refer up.

We need a decision
now, Minister.

Legally, we don't
have a problem?

No, we don't.

No. That is not what I...

432
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,919
This is a change of mission from a
capture to a shoot-to-kill, isn't it?

00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,393
Yes, it is.

Do we have
permission to proceed?

444
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,872
No. Such a plan should not
have been signed off by the PM

without the
authority of Parliament.

not at Parliament.

I know the protocol.
I'm talking about what should be happening.

449
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,394
Angela, in my view,
all the legal criteria

450
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,192
for an attack
have been met.

451

Namely, this is
a military necessity,

452
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,670
there is no
reasonable alternative,

453
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,309
and the force to be used is
in proportion to the threat.

454
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,719
That should
answer your question.

455
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,074
It does not, George.

456

Yes, ma'am.
<i>This is a friendly city,</i>

476
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,240

479
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,712
Is my government
aware that we are

480
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,791
targeting a person
with a US passport?

481
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,192
Yes. Yes, it is,
Lieutenant.

482
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,995
I didn't see anything
in the SPINS about that.

483
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,840

Stand by for targeting brief.

502
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,629
Ready.

503
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,477
Angela, I agree,
we are at risk of being perceived

504
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,869
as embarking on
a shoot-to-kill policy.

505
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,713
But since all the legal
criteria are sound,

506
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,189
I believe we must allow this
military action to continue.

507
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,349
ANGELA: Legally
we may be safe,

508
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,192
but politically we're
walking into a minefield.

509
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,271
Especially with an
American citizen involved.

510
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,157
Do I have permission,
Minister?

511
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,595
BRIAN: Um...

512
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,918
Given the situation,
that it is a change of mission,

513
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,354
that it is now a missile
attack on a British subject,

514
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,477
two British subjects,
and an American citizen,

515
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,078
and in a friendly country,

516
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,360
I think it is
only right and proper

517
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,829
that I refer this up to
the Foreign Secretary.

518
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,714
Minister, you've heard
the arguments, he hasn't.

519
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,756
And the rules of
engagement mean that

520
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,956
the Prime Minister
has already approved it.

521
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
No...
Therefore,

522
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,429
the Foreign Secretary's input
should not be rendered...

523
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,478
No, the point is that
I have not been party

524
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,710
to any previous discussion
with the Prime Minister

525
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,552
about matters
such as this,

526
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,949
whereas the Foreign Secretary
undoubtedly has.

527
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,270
So, actually, it is my
duty to refer to him.

528
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,554

telling Colonel Powell?

room here, where the explosives are,

551
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,550
we would expect 100%
mortality rate in that room

552
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,076
and an 80 to 90% rate within
the rest of the house.

553
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,399
The market should be safe,

554

but this area
here in the street...

555
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,509
A 65 to 75% rate.

556

That's just the Hellfire.

557
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,396
If we factor in
the explosives in the vests,

558
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,268
we're looking at even more extensive
damage way out to this area here.

But I can't accurately
estimate that yield.

560
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,076
But we would be containing
that payload in the vests

561
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,434
within those walls, right?

562

01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,833
<i>but we should assume they intend
to target a crowded location.</i>

785
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,638
GEORGE: A 65% assessment

786
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,836
requires us to
do whatever we can

787
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,751
to enable her to be
removed from the scene.

788
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,831
We have done what
we can for her

789
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,069
in the time
available to us.

790
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,229
COLONEL POWELL:
<i>If we wait and they leave,</i>

791
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,200
<i>we will no longer have
control of the situation.</i>

792
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,315
<i>We must strike now.</i>

793
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,437
There is no law covering a
situation quite like this.

794
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,519
It's one thing to release a missile
whilst the street is clear

795
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,875
in the hope that
it will remain so.

796
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,439
It's quite another thing
knowing that

797
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,272
this girl will,

798
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,079
at worst,
be fatally injured

799
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,355
and, at best,
severely injured.

800
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,589
So, I'm sorry, I disagree with the
assessment of your lawyer at Northwood.

801
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,680
Agreed.

802
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,556
I hope the fact that she's a sweet little
girl is not clouding your judgment.

803
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,995
Dozens of other
little girls' lives

804
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,833
are at stake if
these men leave.

805
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,394
I'm sorry, but we have a Miss Jillian
Goldman from the White House

806
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,754
asking to be patched in.

807
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,353
Who?
Jillian Goldman.

808
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,796
She's a Senior Legal Adviser at
the US National Security Council.

809
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,751
She's been briefed by
the Secretary of State.

810
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,279
Put her through.

811
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,074
<i>Good afternoon and thank you
for allowing me to comment.</i>

812
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,752
Yeah, thanks for joining us.

813
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,910
<i>As the military members
of your committee know,</i>

814
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,231
<i>we have a point system that takes
into account collateral damage</i>

815
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,471
<i>to deduce what is and
what is not a legal strike.</i>

816
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,630
<i>And let me tell
you categorically</i>

817
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,751
<i>that the existence of
this new circumstance</i>

818
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,559
<i>does not push us beyond
a legitimate military action.</i>

819
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,791
<i>We are way off what we would
consider a dispute in this matter.</i>

820
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,236
Miss Goldman, we have a
somewhat different approach

821
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,912
to the question of
collateral damage.

822
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,917
<i>Sir, you must act now.
You have two men</i>

823
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,076
<i>about to embark on
a suicide mission.</i>

824
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,957
<i>You have number two,
four, and five</i>

826
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,438
<i>and you are putting
the whole mission at risk</i>

827
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,988
<i>because of one
collateral damage issue?</i>

828
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,435
<i>I realize that this
mission is your call,</i>

829
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,112

833

I'm sorry. We have the Foreign
Secretary wanting to join.

834
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,589
Right. We appreciate your thoughts,
Miss Goldman.

835
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,680

<i>Good afternoon, everybody.
Excuse my appearance.</i>

838

<i>It's night here, and I have
a bout of food poisoning.</i>

839
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,916
Sorry to drag you
from your sick bed.

840
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,479
That's quite all right.

841
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,315
George, do I understand
this correctly?

842
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,436
There's a legal
argument for waiting

843
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,750
and giving this girl a
chance to sell her bread?

844
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,115
Yes, there is.

845
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,758
But, conversely,
it does not mean

846
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,632
that there is not also
a legal argument

847
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,512
for releasing the weapon now.

848
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,040
Forgive me,
I'm not sure that helps me.

849
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:54,834
Foreign Secretary, there is a
military necessity for acting now.

850
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:59,311
In our view, they'll be making a
move from that house at any moment.

851
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:04,030
Gentlemen, what action is being
legally recommended to me?

852
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,032
James, the legal argument
is that we could wait,

853
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:08,838
but we need not wait.

854
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,992
And the military argument
is that we should not wait.

855
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,433
Right?
Exactly.

856
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,310
It's my recommendation
that we should not delay

857
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,351
<i>in proceeding
with this mission.</i>

858
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,237
<i>If we don't act now,
we risk losing</i>

859
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,833
the lives of
up to 80 people.

860
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,036
You can only
assume those deaths.

861
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,509
What is certain is
that if we do act now,

862
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,318
this one girl
will suffer.

863
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,597
And you would save her and
risk killing 80 others?

864
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,715
Yes, I would save
her and take that risk.

865
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,472
That is what I would do.

866
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:51,713
Angela, is it you or me who will
be invited onto the <i>Today</i> program

867
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,438
to explain why we
knew of the attack

868
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,152
on a shopping center
that killed 80 people,

869
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,117
but chose to do
nothing to stop it?

870
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,269
You, James.

871
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:04,954
But frankly, politically,
I'd rather point to Al-Shabab

872
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,712
as murderers of
80 people shopping

873
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,558
than have to
defend a drone attack

874
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,518
by our forces that
kills an innocent child.

875
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,557
James, Angela makes
a compelling point.

876
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,231
If Al-Shabab kill 80 people,
we win the propaganda war.

877
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,157
If we kill one child,
they do.

878
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,113
So, we don't do it?

879
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,839

feel uncomfortable

wait a little longer.

us close in on the remains of Danford.</i>

Yes, sir.

Carrie, we need to
go identify the body.

Susan Helen Danford.

Thank you, sir.

I'm sorry, Sadd,
I couldn't see any other option.

I understand that.

report as a 45% CDE.

In my opinion,

1122
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:36,791
that was disgraceful.

1123
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:43,118

is terrible.

1129
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:18,115
What these men would've done
would've been even more terrible.

1130
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,758
Never tell a soldier

1131
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:30,037
that he does not
know the cost of war.
