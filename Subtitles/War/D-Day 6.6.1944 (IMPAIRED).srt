<i>May 1940.</i>

2
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:22,097
<i>The British are routed on the beaches of France.</i>

3
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:27,466
<i>But Churchill vowed one day to return.</i>

4
00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:32,740
<i>For four years, the world waited.</i>

5
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:36,415
<i>On June 6th, 1944,</i>

6
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:39,499
<i>the waiting was finally over.</i>

7
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:46,703
(CHURCHILL) The hour of our greatest
effort and action is approaching.

8
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:50,098
<i>It will be a day of endless and bloody battle.</i>

9
00:02:50,307 --> 00:02:55,461
We march with valiant allies
who count on us as we count on them.

10
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:58,858
<i>In the air, at sea and on land.</i>

11
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:02,425
And when the signal is given,

12
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:07,098
a whole circle of avenging nations
will hurl themselves upon the foe.

13
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:16,498
<i>At midnight, British elite forces</i>
<i>set out on a top-secret mission.</i>

14
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:20,503
This mission is dangerous, but it's crucial.

15
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:24,256
<i>If they fail, thousands of lives will be lost.</i>

16
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:28,621
<i>At dawn, off the Normandy coast,</i>

17
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:32,302
<i>a massive armada assembles undetected,</i>

18
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:36,380
<i>and the first ground troops</i>
<i>set foot in occupied France.</i>

19
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:40,466
<i>Amongst them, an American,</i>
<i>armed only with a camera.</i>

20
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,621
You know what? I'm feeling lucky.

21
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:48,025
"Shoot them before they shoot you."
That's what my dad said before I left.

22
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:51,577
<i>At noon, British troops advance inland,</i>

23
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:56,616
<i>ready for the violent counter-attack</i>
<i>they know will come.</i>

24
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,856
<i>At 3 p. m. In the city of Caen,</i>

25
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:06,784
<i>a French Resistance worker has just minutes</i>
<i>to save a hospital from Allied bombing.</i>

26
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:16,261
<i>Before midnight, the Allies</i>
<i>must establish a bridgehead in France,</i>

27
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:20,938
<i>the first step in the liberation of Europe</i>
<i>and the defeat of the Nazis.</i>

28
00:04:22,747 --> 00:04:29,459
<i>It will be a day on which ordinary people</i>
<i>will be called upon to do extraordinary things.</i>

29
00:04:29,627 --> 00:04:35,657
<i>These are the true stories</i>
<i>of some of those who lived through D-Day.</i>

30
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:53,980
Collins, meet England.

31
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:57,304
- England, meet Collins.
- This is where Bob Hope's from.

32
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:01,466
What are you talking about, Collins?
Bob Hope's an American.

33
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,261
No, I read it. He was born in England.

34
00:05:04,427 --> 00:05:08,386
I'm gonna knock you out
if you don't stop winding me up!

35
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:11,098
Bob Hope!

36
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:14,983
<i>By January 1944,</i>

37
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:19,140
<i>one in ten of all men in Great Britain</i>
<i>is an Allied soldier,</i>

38

<i>and one of them, the new commander</i>
<i>of the forces of the free world,</i>

39

44

<i>we also have the first newsreel message</i>
<i>from the leader of the second front.</i>

45
00:05:45,547 --> 00:05:49,665
Goddamn reporters!
How am I supposed to get the job done

46
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:54,258
when we've got those bloodhounds
snooping around the whole time?

47
00:05:54,427 --> 00:05:58,306
Perhaps you'll just have
to learn to enjoy their company.

48
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:03,666
<i>Ike has inherited a plan. Hitler is consumed</i>
<i>by his fight against the Russians.</i>

49
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:06,739
<i>The Allies know he cannot fight on two fronts.</i>

50
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:11,139
<i>If they can force him to do so,</i>
<i>they can bring a swift end to the war.</i>

51
00:06:11,307 --> 00:06:15,619
<i>The plan is to invade France</i>
<i>and open the second front.</i>

52
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:21,259
Gentlemen, Berlin will expect us to take
the shortest crossing from Dover to Calais,

53
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,895
where their defenses are strongest.

54
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:28,185
We will surprise them
by taking the long crossing to Normandy.

55
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:32,260
We will land five divisions, establish a bridgehead

56
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:35,260
and drive inland as far as possible.

57
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:40,023
A vicious counter-offensive
from the enemy will come on that day.

58
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:42,178
We will repel it.

59
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:45,265
This is our chance. We must seize it.

60
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,496
We have six months to prepare.

61
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:54,659
<i>Pitted against Eisenhower</i>
<i>is Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.</i>

62
00:06:54,827 --> 00:06:59,947
<i>Hitler has given his most brilliant general</i>
<i>the task of creating an impregnable barrier</i>

63

<i>against the anticipated invasion.</i>

64

<i>(NEWSREEL) Field Marshal Rommel</i>
<i>inspects the Atlantic wall.</i>

65
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,539
<i>It's the longest defense system in the world,</i>

66
00:07:09,747 --> 00:07:12,739
<i>running from the North Pole to the Pyrenees.</i>

67
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:15,580
<i>These brave German soldiers stand ready</i>

68
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:18,978
<i>to defend our European culture and freedom.</i>

69
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:26,626
<i>But behind the propaganda</i>
<i>the reality is very different.</i>

70
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,346
<i>Rommel has asked to be joined</i>
<i>by his old colleague,</i>

<i>Lieutenant-General Hans Speidel.</i>

72
00:08:19,587 --> 00:08:22,021
Temporary accommodation for US troops...

73
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:24,303
<i>As the clock ticks for Rommel,</i>

74
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:29,825
<i>in central London, an operation</i>
<i>of a very different kind is being put into action.</i>

75
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:33,821
Landing craft on the Thames Estuary,
100% canvas.

76
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:37,541
And tanks in the south of England...

77
00:08:38,347 --> 00:08:40,338
100% rubber.

78
00:08:40,547 --> 00:08:45,541
<i>Oxford academic john Masterman is</i>
<i>in charge of a committee of spymasters.</i>

79
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:48,699
<i>Their task - to run an intelligence operation</i>

80
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:51,984
<i>to deceive and confuse</i>
<i>the German High Command.</i>

81
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:54,297
"Operation Fortitude."

82
00:08:54,467 --> 00:09:01,145
The plan to invade France is well under way -
a good plan, but with one great risk attached.

83
00:09:01,347 --> 00:09:03,781
The enemy will be expecting it.

84
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:07,818
The fact is, you can't hide an invading army.

85
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:10,945
But you can obscure its objectives.

86
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:16,425
We must convince the enemy
that "Overlord" is not the invasion

87
00:09:16,587 --> 00:09:22,219
but a diversion from the main assault
which will take place elsewhere at a later date.

88
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:25,140
We will spin two webs of deceit.

89
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:30,578
The first that there is an army in Scotland
preparing to invade Norway.

90
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:36,578
The second that there is an army in the south
preparing to invade Pas-de-Calais.

91
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:40,740
Which is, of course,
where they are expecting the invasion.

92
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:46,901
Between now and D-Day, our double agents
will feed the enemy a rich diet of lies,

93
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:51,458
washed down with a few harmless truths
for the sake of credibility.

94
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:54,824
The question is, which double agents do we use?

95
00:09:55,507 --> 00:10:00,661
<i>In a London suburb is the man</i>
<i>Berlin believes to be their top secret agent,</i>

96
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:05,662
<i>Juan Pujol, a Spaniard, sending them</i>
<i>intelligence from his network of spies.</i>

97
00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:08,295
<i>In fact, all his spies are fictional.</i>

98
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,584
<i>He is a double agent, codenamed "Garbo".</i>

99
00:10:11,747 --> 00:10:14,864
"England must be destroyed and dominated.

100
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,975
"With a raised arm I end this letter

101
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:21,264
"with a pious remembrance for all our dead."

102
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:27,506
Berlin will be delighted
with their new recruits in Swansea.

103
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,420
Who will be the brothers
in the Aryan World Order?

104
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:36,025
I was thinking of creating a retired sailor,
a few salesmen, a WREN, perhaps.

105
00:10:37,547 --> 00:10:40,141
And how's your mistress, Agent j5?

106
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,299
Still giving me information from the War Office.

107
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:46,504
Still asking for clothes and perfume?

108
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,135
She's a very demanding woman.

109
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:56,260
So... this makes 26 wonderful works of fiction.

110
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,585
27.

111
00:10:58,787 --> 00:11:02,382
The more agents,
the more information, the more risk.

112
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:06,335
Sometimes I worry
the whole house of cards could collapse.

113
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:08,702
It is elaborate and beautiful.

114
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,898

Four concrete casemates, six feet thick,

15 to 20 gun pits,
four to five machine guns in each.

Two six-foot barbed-wire perimeter fences,
anti-tank ditches and a minefield.

Thousands of men killed on the beach.

They can hit incoming battleships and the beach
where 30,000 Allied troops will land.

149
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:26,379
They can do a lot of damage. Any questions?

150
00:16:26,547 --> 00:16:28,822
- What is our mission, sir?
- To take it.

151
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:32,900
We have four hours to destroy the battery
before the landings begin.

152
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:38,141
"B" Company and "C" Company
will mount the main assault here.

153
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:42,223
A diversion party will attack the main gate here.

154
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:47,578
"A" Company will arrive in gliders
immediately prior to the initial assault.

155
00:16:47,747 --> 00:16:50,386
- At night, sir?
- Where will they land, sir?

156
00:16:51,747 --> 00:16:53,339
On top of it.

157
00:16:53,507 --> 00:17:00,060
<i>We knew it was going to be big and important</i>
<i>and that we would be up at the front of it.</i>

158
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:03,944
But it seemed so... impossible.

159
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:09,820
If we fail, the entire Allied left flank
could be decimated.

160
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,979
This mission is dangerous, but it's crucial.

161
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:22,257
<i>The imminent invasion</i>
<i>is the world's biggest story</i>

162
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:25,857
<i>and a magnet for the world's biggest storytellers.</i>

163
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:29,383
London felt like the capital of the whole world.

164
00:17:29,547 --> 00:17:33,540
It was the place to be,
especially if you were a journalist.

165
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:38,178
Everyone looked to Capa to be
the big-shot photographer for the invasion

166
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:44,297
because he had been covering war
ever since the Spanish Civil War in 1936.

167
00:17:44,987 --> 00:17:46,386
(WOMAN) Gotcha!

168
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:51,063
<i>Bob had a sense of his own destiny,</i>
<i>which was tragic, in a way,</i>

169
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:56,864
because his destiny was to...
to cover the world at its worst.

170
00:17:57,507 --> 00:18:00,817
- I can't believe you're back.
- Of course I'm back.

171
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:04,582
I told the office
I hadn't seen my gal in seven months.

172
00:18:05,387 --> 00:18:07,537
You're a terrible liar.

173
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:13,100
OK, but I want to be with the boys
when they liberate my Paris. I won't miss that.

174
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:17,505
Let's not talk about the war.
That's not what we're here for.

175
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:22,457
<i>(JOHN MORRIS) Pinky was not terribly serious,</i>
<i>except about lovemaking.</i>

176
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:26,735
<i>She was madly in love with Capa.</i>

177
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:30,095
(PINKY) I thought you weren't wasting film.

178
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:34,499
(CAPA) Those guys are counting on me
to get the pictures of the big day.

179
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:38,700
Robert Capa, humanitarian and war photographer.

180
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:41,695
I'm a gambler, not a humanitarian.

181
00:18:42,467 --> 00:18:44,935
Humanitarians believe in humanity.

182
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:48,736
For me, it's just a matter
of drawing the right cards.

183
00:18:53,227 --> 00:18:55,695
<i>While Capa relaxes in London,</i>

184
00:18:55,867 --> 00:19:00,463
<i>Rommel inspects the beach</i>
<i>the Allies have already codenamed "Omaha".</i>

185

<i>He is battling to reinforce</i>
<i>the Normandy beach defenses</i>

<i>and place armored divisions close inland.</i>

187
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:22,382
<i>(TRANSLATION) After Rommel was here,</i>
<i>we started to think, "This is getting serious."</i>

188
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:26,745
<i>Before that, we were quite relaxed about it,</i>

189
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:30,820
<i>but suddenly there was Rommel saying,</i>
<i>"They'll come here."</i>

190
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,186
Move!

191
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:19,341
Bang! Let's go! Come on, let's go!

192
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,538
Move! Move!

193
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:25,495
<i>We had nine rehearsals by night and day.</i>

194
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:31,337
<i>They had to do it time and time again</i>
<i>until they were perfect.</i>

195
00:21:31,547 --> 00:21:34,186
Too slow! Too late!

196
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:39,745
If you hesitate, you could be shot.
And they understood that.

197
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:41,545
Come in from the right!

198
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:45,666
Where's that bloody flamethrower?
Idle bastards, get in here!

199
00:21:46,747 --> 00:21:50,137
<i>The last time we did it, it was for real.</i>

200
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:57,060
<i>We had a tremendous kind of gung-ho feeling.</i>

201
00:21:58,387 --> 00:22:00,378
OK, stop! Back to the start!

202
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:02,936
<i>It was different.</i>

203
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:08,622
- We're good. We're bloody good!
- Not bloody good enough. Let's go!

204
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:16,020
- Did you ask Washington about landing craft?
- They're thinking about it.

205
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:19,577
Perhaps we could tell them not to think,
just to do it.

206
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:23,217
<i>Amongst the many problems</i>
<i>Eisenhower must solve</i>

207
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:29,462
<i>is the risk of taking a vast armada</i>
<i>across 100 miles of heavily patrolled water.</i>

208
00:22:30,827 --> 00:22:33,102
What about the rehearsals for the landings?

209
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:38,625
Exercise Tiger is due to take place
off the south coast on April 28th, sir.

210
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:44,703
Half of them have never even tasted battle before.
The least we can do is prepare them for it.

211
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:48,223
Exercise Tiger is a major rehearsal for D-Day.

212
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:51,982
Not just the beach landings,
but also the complex naval operations.

213
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:56,140
The seas between here and Normandy
are rife with danger.

214
00:22:56,307 --> 00:23:02,655
We will take troops by night across open water
to designated target beaches on the south coast.

215
00:23:02,827 --> 00:23:08,584
This is a training exercise,
but for everyone involved, it's the real thing.

216
00:23:11,227 --> 00:23:15,823
<i>It was getting us ready for Normandy</i>
<i>is what it was doing.</i>

217
00:23:16,827 --> 00:23:19,387

218
00:23:19,547 --> 00:23:21,936
<i>for such a tragedy to happen.</i>

<i>- 15.</i>

Three targets bearing 275-280.

shown how to use their life preservers.

- We don't know, sir.

297

And the men with security clearance
for "Overlord"? Are they accounted for?

298
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,418
Yes, sir. Ten.

299
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:26,458
All dead.

300

<i>and security is paramount.</i>

It was getting near the time now.

305
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:58,863
I took my platoon out
into the middle of a football field

306
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:03,225

what I had just been told by the colonel.

307
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,855
Our target is, of course, a gun battery.

308
00:30:06,027 --> 00:30:08,985
And to put it bluntly, it's lethal.

309
00:30:10,387 --> 00:30:13,777
If we don't put it out of action,
a lot of men will die.

310

Our second mission is to take a radar station
about a mile from the battery.

Yes, sir. The men are very grateful.
It's nice to have some female company.

- Treatment of the Jews, for example.

Now then, D-Day itself...

474
00:44:38,347 --> 00:44:43,626
It is essential that we maintain the deception
for at least three days after the landings.

475
00:44:43,787 --> 00:44:47,939
Garbo could send a message
saying it isn't the real invasion.

476
00:44:48,107 --> 00:44:53,500
Be hard to convince them when they have
150,000 troops on their doorstep!

477
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:56,943
To sell them the lie, we must give them a truth.

478
00:44:57,107 --> 00:45:01,897
We give them a piece of information
which they consider extremely valuable.

They will then be in the right frame of mind
to be deceived.

- Yes, it is. Wars are like that, I suppose.

It's a nuisance,
but there's nothing we can do about it.

482
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:18,822
Two messages.
In the first, we give them the truth.

483
00:45:18,987 --> 00:45:23,742
- We say Allied troops are due to land.
- On D-Day? That information is critical.

484
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:26,700
- We can't warn them.
- You're their main agent.

485
00:45:26,867 --> 00:45:32,624
If they see troops landing and hear
nothing from you, they'll be suspicious.

486
00:45:32,787 --> 00:45:37,099
The message must be early enough
to be a warning, but too late to take action.

487
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:41,943
That way we seal your credibility.
The trap is set and we send the second message.

488
00:45:42,147 --> 00:45:43,626
I see.

489
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:49,342
- Agent 4 is the best man for the job.
- In Southampton?

490
00:45:50,427 --> 00:45:56,821
He's in the right place. He will tell them
that he has seen troops boarding ships.

491
00:45:57,027 --> 00:46:00,576
He's in a sealed camp.
He can't contact the outside.

492
00:46:00,787 --> 00:46:05,258
I will tell them he deserted
with two other Americans, paratroopers.

493
00:46:05,427 --> 00:46:07,782
Hmm. Signalmen or something.

494
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:13,459
Vomit bags. He saw vomit bags being
handed out to soldiers, and cold rations.
