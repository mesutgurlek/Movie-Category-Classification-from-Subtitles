Then he will not have me killed.

172
00:14:26,483 --> 00:14:27,483
No,

173
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:29,785
he will not have you killed.

174
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,689
Burgred, you and I will be joint
rulers to the throne of Mercia.

175
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,223
Does that not excite you, hmm?

176
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,860
The Mercians may quarrel against us.

177
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:39,427
No, they will not.

178
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:43,848
Behind us are the iron fists of
both Wessex and the Northmen.

179
00:14:44,401 --> 00:14:45,500
Do you see?

180
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,586
Then we will be prisoners
of Ecbert and Ragnar.

181
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:52,140
I suppose.

182
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:55,510
But better prisoners than dead, hmm?

183
00:14:56,697 --> 00:14:58,513
Prisoners can always escape.

184
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:23,121
It is not his fault.

185
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,109
No, you are right.

186
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,096
It is someone else's fault.

187
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:32,415
Who's that?

188
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:35,283
Is it not clear to you, Bjorn Ironside?

189
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:39,854
Who brought the Christ god
into our lives?

190
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:42,958
Floki says we have betrayed our gods

191
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,010
to serve a Christian king
and a Christian god.

192
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:51,900
Unlike Floki, I do not think
I can speak for the gods.

193
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:57,089
All I know is that my
desires and ambitions

194
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,808
for our people have never changed.

195
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,210
And now that I am King,

196
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:05,013
I must try to bring them about.

197
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,019
What limits did Odin
put upon his curiosity?

198
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,672
- Who can say?
- Exactly.

199
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,358
So unless I seek out those limits,

200
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:19,027
I cannot say that I
have honored his spirit.

201
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:21,630
Floki threatens me with Odin,

202
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:25,266
but I would not be ashamed
to meet the god face-to-face.

203
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:35,911
When Ragnar returns,
I am sure he will stay but a short time

204
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,779
before sailing back home.

205
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:41,816
He is, after all, a king.

206
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,886
But you could stay.

207
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:48,240
To what purpose, King Ecbert?

208
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,424
Well, surely,

209
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:54,829
someone must stay to make sure that
the new settlement is successful,

210
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,399
the first harvest safely gathered.

211
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:00,753
Someone will stay to do that.

212
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:04,739
But even if I am not a king,
I am an earl.

213
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,444
I must return to look after my people.

214
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:12,298
It is fine and it is good
to talk of responsibilities,

215
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,717
but there are other things in life.

216
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:20,555
What if I asked you personally to stay?

217
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:24,159
I have enjoyed your company.

218
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,361

although you have made me
happy and fulfilled,

222
00:17:41,812 --> 00:17:43,946
I have come to understand that

223

224

is yourself.

Forgive me, Earl Kalf.

227
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,673
There is something we
must earnestly consider.

228
00:18:17,948 --> 00:18:22,500
And what must I so earnestly consider?

229
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,839
At some point, if she still lives,

230
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,958
Lagertha will return from the raid.

231
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,827
And she will bring with her
most of our young warriors,

232
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:33,162

233

And, I assume, loyal to her.

Do you really suppose that
I have not considered that?

236

Do you really think, poor Einar,

237
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,243
that I have not prepared for that?

238

239

00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:10,224
The battle for Mercia is won.

339
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:15,880
But not yet the settlement.
Stay. Stay, both of you.

340
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:17,898
Oversee your future.

341
00:29:18,284 --> 00:29:19,934
What could be more important?

342
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:22,002
I have told you my decision.

343
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:27,040
Perhaps Athelstan will stay.

344
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:29,093
Will you?

345
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,112
I'm not sure.

346
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:34,632
I've not discussed it with Ragnar.

347
00:29:34,633 --> 00:29:37,117
Hmm, or with Judith.

348
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:42,356
My daughter-in-law
has grown fond of you.

349
00:29:43,058 --> 00:29:45,025
I know it. She has told me.

350
00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:48,996
She sometimes uses you as a confessor.

351
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:53,333
If you go, she will miss you.

352
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,436
As indeed will I.

353
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,455
They are trying to make you stay?

354
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:19,126
Yes.

355
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:25,148
There is something
between you and that girl?

356
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,870
Yes.

357
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:32,356
You don't understand.

358
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:35,642
Nobody understands.

359
00:30:42,735 --> 00:30:45,319
We're all free to do as we please.

360
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:48,990
Are we still talking about women?

361
00:30:48,991 --> 00:30:50,257
Mmm.

362
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:05,288
They say you will go home with Ragnar.

363
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,263
Your husband is back.

364
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:14,047
I gave myself to you.

365
00:31:16,018 --> 00:31:17,467
Please don't leave me.

366
00:31:21,223 --> 00:31:22,472
(MOANING)

367
00:31:29,758 --> 00:31:30,957
(LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING)

368
00:31:33,445 --> 00:31:35,262
LOTHBROK:
What will you do with Mercia?

369
00:31:35,797 --> 00:31:40,200
I will crown Kwenthrith and her
brother Burgred as joint rulers.

370
00:31:40,969 --> 00:31:42,303
That makes sense.

371
00:31:42,304 --> 00:31:45,338
You see how they feel for one another.
Why choose between them?

372
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:48,308
They will not rule in any case.

373
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:53,381
Then who will, Ragnar Lothbrok?

374
00:31:53,382 --> 00:31:54,382
You will.

375
00:31:55,484 --> 00:31:57,584
For you have given them the crown.

376
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:04,024
Well, the important thing for me is that
there will be stability in the region.

377
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:10,697
The important thing for you is that
Wessex will have power in Mercia.

378
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:17,304
Actually, the really important
thing for me

379
00:32:17,873 --> 00:32:20,424
is that your settlement is a success.

380
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:22,443
You've helped me in my
conquest for Mercia,

381
00:32:22,444 --> 00:32:25,279
and I've helped you to
establish a settlement

382
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,815
in the very heart of my kingdom.

383
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:31,685
If you remember, it was one of the
first things we ever talked about.

384
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:33,753
I remember it very well.

385
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:36,790
You and I,

386
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,293
we understand each other.

387
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:46,232
That is why we are allies,
and will remain so.

388
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,011
LOTHBROK:
Do you think you're a good man?

389
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:02,283
Yes.

390
00:33:03,352 --> 00:33:04,584
I think so.

391
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,689
Are you a good man?

392
00:33:12,978 --> 00:33:13,978
Yes.

393
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:17,731
I think so.

394
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:24,320
Are you corrupt?

395
00:33:27,576 --> 00:33:28,842
Oh, yes.

396
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:32,812
- Are you?
- Mmm-hmm.

397
00:33:39,888 --> 00:33:40,888
ROLLO:
Floki?

398
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:46,459
What are you doing out here?

399
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,497
I came to talk to the gods.

400
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:54,601
They are angry, Rollo.

401
00:33:58,924 --> 00:34:02,442
And I'm so afraid that we must one day
choose between them

402
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:04,844
and your brother.

403
00:34:07,015 --> 00:34:09,082
For me, it will never come to that.

(CROWD CHATTERING)

405
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,203
So...

406
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:32,552
once again, Athelstan,
you have to make a choice.

407
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:38,879
Will you go back with Ragnar Lothbrok
or will you stay with us?

408
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,447
I have made up my mind.

409
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:44,050
I will go back with Ragnar.

410
00:34:46,354 --> 00:34:48,521
All my future lies with Ragnar.

411
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:55,228
I think that is the wrong decision.

412
00:34:59,084 --> 00:35:01,584
So, you left your earldom.

413
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,090
Are you not afraid?

414
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:12,679
No, I have a good man
who looks after it for me.

415
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:16,015
Why should I be afraid?

416
00:35:19,621 --> 00:35:21,421
All men are ambitious.

417
00:35:23,258 --> 00:35:24,258
Not Kalf.

EINAR: (WHISPERING)

419
00:35:37,322 --> 00:35:38,538
Earl Kalf.

420
00:35:41,092 --> 00:35:43,209
- Earl Kalf!
- Mmm...

421
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:45,845

00:36:12,424 --> 00:36:14,841
How gladly we welcome you to our hall.

426
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:19,312
How impatiently
I have awaited your coming.

427
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:22,099
I'm most grateful
for your invitation, Earl Kalf.

428
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,520
I believe with all my heart that
you and I are natural allies.

429
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:29,857
Yes! Against the Lothbroks
and all their kith and kin.

430
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:32,275
And we have another natural ally.

431
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:37,196
You may recall that Ragnar
blood eagled his enemy, Jarl Borg.

432
00:36:37,866 --> 00:36:40,416
But he forgot to kill Jarl Borg's wife,

433
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:42,669
who subsequently gave birth to a son,

434
00:36:43,204 --> 00:36:45,038
and who is now my wife.

435
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:47,123
Come, Torvi.

436
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:55,882
Good day to you, Earl Kalf.

437
00:36:56,635 --> 00:36:58,217
Good day to you, Torvi.

438
00:36:58,553 --> 00:37:00,219
And to your son,

439
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:04,190
the legitimate heir of
the great Jarl Borg.

440
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:11,890
My dear brother, my dear Burgred,

441
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:15,908
before all these people,
before King Ecbert of Wessex,

442
00:37:16,461 --> 00:37:19,579
King Ragnar
and King Aelle of Northumbria,

443
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:24,150
let me say that I have
made peace with my past.

444
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:26,986
I have come to terms with my family,

445
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:29,455
with all the violence visited upon me.

446
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:34,060
And now at last I am free from my anger,

447
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:36,596
saved from my nightmares.

448
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:41,434
And, finally, I know who I am.

449
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:45,221
And so, my dear,

450
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,024
let us celebrate our alliance,

451
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,912

Nothing to talk about?

suffer such pains as before.

you could ask the Seer.
