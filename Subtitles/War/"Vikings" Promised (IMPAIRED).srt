I feel so old.

501
00:28:23,426 --> 00:28:25,960
When I was young I had
the passion to win,

502
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:30,498
but now, with age and
all that comes with it,

And the strength.

A few years ago I
established a settlement

506
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:54,857
in a distant country where I took
many of my people and friends

507

to make a new life for themselves.

508
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,197
But shortly after my departure,
they were all slaughtered.

509
00:29:03,233 --> 00:29:05,830
Their homes destroyed and burned.

510
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:09,870
I live with such guilt because of it.

It is Floki, the boat builder.

For some reason no one will tell me,

he has fallen out with King Ragnar.
