About a year ago, a young Amerasian child

came to the mission, begging for help.

anything I could do

for the U.S. Embassy during the war.

Why is it so hard for you to believe me?

154

Because I saw my wife's body
burnt to a crisp, that's why!

Van... (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE)

333

I speak English, Braddock!

334
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:25,018
For years, he dreamed about you.

335
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:28,521
Sometimes, in very difficult moments,

336
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,983
I would find him talking to you
as if you were there.

337
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,612
And somehow you
would make things right for him.

338
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:39,491
But one day, he stopped believing.

339
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:43,662
I tried to keep you alive in his heart.

340

341
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:58,068
I guess I know how you feel, Van.

342
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,553
Thinking that I deserted you
and your mother.

343
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,827
But... I want you to know that...

344

and your mother were alive,
