- Huh?

Yeah, Ma. Feed the chickens,

Come on, soldier,
hit the deck!

You're supposed to wake me, you know.
I'm your commanding officer.

Oh! Korea!

8
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,580
- I'm not supposed to wake you.
- That's very kind of you, sir. It's really...

9

- I'm not interested in kindness.
- I've heard that, sir.

10
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:41,455
- I've had enough of your oversleeping.
- I just do it in the mornings.

11
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:44,621
Haven't I told you
not to sleep in your uniform?

Sir, the-the blankets itch.
There's things in 'em.

Nonsense. Did you sleep
in your clothes at home?

I was more
of a person there, sir.

- Yes, sir.

- It's over there.

Where?

18

In the file cabinet under "B."

- And your clipboard's under "C," of course.
- No. "K."

20

doing in this man's army.
- Me too, sir.

- After breakfast.

- Major Burns?

- <i>Yes, Father?</i>
- I have us two seconds
quicker than yesterday.

46
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:15,714
Your watch must be off.

47
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:19,740
Hardly likely. It was given
to me by my bishop.

not going to get you out.

A can of Danish ham
is missing from my office.

It was a personal ham sent to me
by my insurance man.

Soap could only improve it.

We couldn't reach you in Tokyo.
We tried for 24 hours.

That was the idea. I was on R-and-R.

He waited around

[Sighs] Okay, but just remember
this was his idea.

120
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:36,164

- Couple hours. He's taking

The time Mclntyre sedated you
and shaved every bit of hair off your body.

127
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:06,430
He's still better than Pierce. God only knows
how he carried on in Tokyo.

00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:08,595
- I'm sure.

Oh, yeah.

Ever since I've been commanding officer,
you don't let me do anything.

- It's about time you checked in.

139

You're not going anywhere.

Frank, I lived with the guy for over a year.
He's my best friend.

You're exaggerating
his importance.

- He was very important to you too, Frank.
- Says who?

- Papers just came through
on Captain Hunnicutt, sir.
- Who?

150
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:20,708
Captain Mclntyre's replacement.

151
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:23,210
He's due at Kimpo within the hour.
Permission granted to go pick him up?

152
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:25,508
Permission granted, Corporal.

153
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:27,674
Oh. Sorry, Major.

Uh, must be something
in the water, sir.

158

Take it off.
First, get into a dry uniform.

- Oh, Lord.

Request permission
to go to my quarters, sir!

- Oh, scram!
- Scramming, sir!

162

What a dodo.

163
00:11:55,077 --> 00:11:57,807
Frank, look!
Hunnicutt's fresh out of residency.

164

Stanford Medical School.
Wonderful qualifications.

165

And look at this.
Tau Phi Epsilon.

166
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:07,722
- Is that a very selective fraternity?
- Very! They blackballed me.

167
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,385
- Oh, Frank.
- They insisted on double-breasted
tuxedos. I didn't have one.

168
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,419
- Poor baby.
- I dyed my brown suit,
but it ran when I danced.

169
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:18,796
- You tend to perspire.
- It's a family thing on my mother's side.

170
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,802
Dad was always dry,
but Mom sweated a lot.

171
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,566
Yeah. I've got his face
and her glands.

172
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,541
Look at this!
Top ten every time he graduated.

173
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:30,874
He certainly sounds like
our kind of person. [Laughing]

174
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:36,179
Oh, it'll be a welcome change from all the
guff we took from those two "smartskis."

175
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:39,015
Hunnicutt. Hunnicutt.

176
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:44,150
I knew a Dr. Hunnicutt. He was killed
in an explosion at the goiter clinic.

177
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:47,889
What an opportunity.
Ayoung doctor on his first assignment.

178
00:12:47,963 --> 00:12:50,227
And we'll train him
our way, Frank.

You know, Margaret,
I have a feeling.

Oh, that would be
too much to ask.

- Why?

Because you drive like I spit.

185

- Move!

186

- Is that a direct order?
- Would I do that to you?

187
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:13,987
- Major Burns will have my tail in a sling.
- He'll never know.

188
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:17,890
He's crazy! He's always feeling
my toothbrush to see if it's wet.

Who lets you develop
the nurses' chest X rays? Huh?

If anybody asks,
I'm completely ignorant.

Thanks. I'll get 'em.
Pull up. Block the road.

I gotta get him to the hospital, 121 st.
What's wrong with him?

214
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:24,132
Neurapraxia.
Worst case I've ever seen.

215

What's that?

216

Neurapraxia?

217
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:32,249
It's a temporary loss of nerve function.
I've got him sedated now.

218
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:37,188
Otherwise he'd foam at the mouth,
crawl on the ground, try to bite his nose.

219
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,650
Very contagious.

Aren't you afraid to get it?

Yes, sir.
Are you sure, Colonel?

That's what we came in here to forget.

294
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:30,949
I forgot.

295
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:33,144
- What'll you have, Captain?
- Bourbon and water.

296
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:35,915
And you, Captain?

297
00:20:35,989 --> 00:20:38,685
- Captain?
- Not so loud.

298
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:42,387
I'll have the usual,
a Grape Nehi.

299
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:46,626
Two bourbon and water,
and a Grape Nehi for Captain O'Reilly.

00:20:53,973 --> 00:20:57,033
They're not low.
The ground here is very high.

303
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,240
- He's not usually like this.
He's just like that.
- You're gonna love it over here.

304
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:04,806
Camping out, betting on rat races,
hot and cold running dysentery.

305
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:06,818
To think what
I've been missing.

306
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:08,979
- You married?
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:21:09,055 --> 00:21:11,114
You bring your wife with you?

308
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:13,819
- I thought I'd come ahead and check it out.
- Hmm.

309
00:21:13,893 --> 00:21:17,761
- You married?
- Someone's gonna have
to get me pregnant first.

310
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:20,925
There's two on the aisle.

Thank you.

312
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:36,074
Does the, uh, captain
want a straw?

313
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:41,642
We don't use straws
in combat, fella.

314
00:21:44,752 --> 00:21:47,585
B. J., welcome to Korea.

315
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:50,146

- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

Ohhh! There's
real grape flavor in this.

322
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:16,342
Tough it out, cowboy.

323
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,749
Why don't you let me
stand outside, Hawkeye?

324
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:20,753
Hawkeye.
Why Hawkeye?

325
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:23,153
That's from
<i>The Last of the Mohicans.</i>

326
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:27,593
My father was crazy about that book.
He was crazy about Indians.

327
00:22:27,662 --> 00:22:30,153
My grandfather used to sell them
whiskey and hors d'oeuvres.

<i>[Jet Engine Roaring]</i>

329
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:36,793
Feel like you just stepped
into a time machine?

330
00:22:36,871 --> 00:22:39,704
Two months ago,
I'm in residency in Sausalito.

331
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:42,504
Little house in Mill Valley,
Peggy's eight months pregnant.

332
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:44,601
And they draft me.

333
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,239
Five weeks' training
at Fort Sam Houston.

334
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:50,409
Bunch of doctors stumbling around
in the dark, totally lost.

335
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:53,112
Some idiot shooting live ammo
over your heads.

336
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:55,849
- American plan.
- Hawkeye?

337
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:59,359
- Huh?
- That colonel.

338
00:22:59,427 --> 00:23:01,987
What colonel, Radar? There's enough
brass in here to make a spittoon.

339
00:23:02,063 --> 00:23:05,089
Over there at 8:00.
He keeps staring at me.

340
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:09,159
He's probably crazy about you.
Go ahead, B. J.

341
00:23:09,236 --> 00:23:11,761
Then one night, Peggy and I
are at the Top of the Mark.

342
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,672
Her first night out
since having the baby.

343
00:23:14,742 --> 00:23:18,838
- We go home. Our baby-sitter,
Norma Jean, says there's a message.
- <i>Wait a minute.</i>

344
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:21,211
- Norma Jean?
- Mm-hmm.

345
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:24,683
- Eighteen? Oooh!
- Sixteen.

346
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:29,018
The message? "In two days,
report to Travis to ship out."

347
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:32,592
Next thing I know,
here I am.

348
00:23:34,462 --> 00:23:38,125
- Hawk? He's coming over here.
- Huh?

349
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,167
- Play hard to get.
- Don't horse around.

350
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:46,699
- Boys.
- <i>Sir.</i>
- <i>Colonel.</i>

351
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:49,607
You all know this is
an officers' club, don't you?

352
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:51,668
I'm a captain,
plainclothes division.

353
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:56,615
Uh-huh. Corporal's stripes
and captain's bars?

354
00:23:56,684 --> 00:24:01,383
That's a new directive
from the pentagon, Colonel.

Corporal captain.

357
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:12,065
<i>We're here making a survey.</i>
<i>Want to see if everybody likes it.</i>

Uh, asking everybody in Seoul.

359
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:17,636
- Coleman Hawkins, right?
- Right.

360
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:19,969
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

361
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:24,102
- Put down one "no." One against.
- Right.

362
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:27,272
One negative corporal captain.

363
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:29,908
Thank you, Colonel. We really
appreciate your help in this.

364
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:34,779
No sir.
I don't like it at all.

365
00:24:34,855 --> 00:24:36,914
He doesn't like it at all.

366
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:41,189
Play it again, Sam.

367
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:46,495
Another Nehi. Gee, if I get gas,
nobody's ever gonna believe I'm an officer.

368
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:50,401
Radar, President Truman gets gas.
They just don't print it in the papers.

369
00:24:50,471 --> 00:24:52,405
What's the 4077 like?

370
00:24:52,473 --> 00:24:55,840
Meatball surgery.
Nothing pretty.

371
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,609
But once we get a casualty to our front door,
his chance of survival is 97.8%% .

372
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:04,879
- That says a lot for the staff.
- It's a good bunch.

373
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:08,353
You missed two of the greatest
guys in the world though.

374
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:11,585
Henry Blake was our C.O.

375
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:14,457
Henry was okay, from the navel
out in every direction.

376
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:16,758
He sure was.

377
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:22,625
Henry never made it home.

378
00:25:22,703 --> 00:25:27,197
And I just missed Trapper John, the guy you're
replacing, by ten minutes. Ten minutes!

379
00:25:27,274 --> 00:25:30,107
- We tried to call you.
- You sure he didn't leave
a message or anything?

380
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:34,443
No. Just what I gave you.
And please don't ask for another one.

381
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:37,973
Listen. Major Burns is waiting for us.
That's our C.O. Now.

382
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:41,487
Bottom of the barrel.

383
00:25:41,555 --> 00:25:44,581
Major Burns.
Major Frank Burns.

384
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:48,116
Everybody calls him Ferret Face.
That'll give you an idea
how devoted we are to him.

385
00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:53,394
- Is he a good surgeon?
- With the same light touch
as a German jazz band.

386
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:57,460
Number one nurses though.
And a good young chaplain.
You'll be bunking with me.

387
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:01,065
- Not too much snoring, I hope.
- Only when I'm awake.

388
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:04,737
All you really have to worry about is getting
me in my coffin before the sun comes up.

389
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:06,746
Fair enough.

390
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:10,079
Well, I guess we'd better start
thinking about how we're gonna
get back to camp, huh?

391
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,643
- We'll have the bill, my good man.
- $1.20.

392
00:26:13,721 --> 00:26:18,158
Ahhh. Pay him,
Corporal Captain.

393
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:23,458
- I only got about 70 cents.
- A big promotion like that,
they didn't give you a raise?

394
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:25,499
This one's on me.

395
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:30,799
You play poker, Doctor?

396
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:34,705
- I'm not very good.
- Neither am I.

397
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:44,917
General.

398
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:46,919
[Gasps]

399
00:26:53,027 --> 00:26:55,689
Look, Radar, our jeep!

400
00:26:55,763 --> 00:26:57,697
- It's a general's jeep!
- No, no, no.

401
00:26:57,765 --> 00:27:00,165
What they've done, in order
to get into the officers' club...

402
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:02,327
they put a general's flag on our jeep.

403
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:05,065
- It's not!
- I can prove it. Test me.

404
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:09,098
- It's olive drab, right? Made in Detroit?
- They all say that.

405
00:27:09,176 --> 00:27:12,873
Mud underneath? Four seats
that can reduce your behind to tears?

406
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:15,745
- Yeah, but...
- They didn't fool me for a minute.

407
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:20,480
- Throw your stuff in the back, B. J.
- Listen, you've been drinking. I drive.

408
00:27:20,554 --> 00:27:22,954
All right. Deal.

409
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:25,116
Next stop, Bed Bug City!

410
00:27:25,192 --> 00:27:27,683
Take this thing.

411
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:30,821
Okay, Radar, follow
the yellow brick road.

412
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:58,354
I'd like that worked into
next Sunday's sermon, Father,
if you can possibly manage it.

413
00:27:58,425 --> 00:28:01,588
"Strength through obedience."

414
00:28:01,662 --> 00:28:04,392
The discipline of this unit,
the lack of respect, is disgraceful!

415
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:08,299
I've had notes stuffed in my suggestion box
that would curl your dickey, Father.

416
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:10,929
These lads are under
terrific stress, Major.

417
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:13,974
They are? What about
the stress of command?

418
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:19,604
I'm running the hospital, the staff,
the supplies, looking right.

419
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,875
I have one Korean,
a college graduate...

420
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:24,543
who does nothing but keep my boots
shined at all times.

421
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:28,645
It costs me three cigarettes
a day, but it's worth it.

422
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:33,022
- I'll look forward to next Sunday, Father.
- I look forward to all of them.

423
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:35,220
I don't get you.

424
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,060
- Major Burns. Father.
- Major.

425
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,663
Did you give permission
that I didn't know about...

426
00:28:42,736 --> 00:28:46,672
- for Captain Pierce to leave this camp?
- I certainly did not!

427
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,731
- Well, he's not anywhere to be found.
- Nowhere?

428
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:50,743
- That's right!
- Have you looked everywhere?

429
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:54,076
Obviously I've looked everywhere if
I know that he's not anywhere or nowhere!

430
00:28:54,148 --> 00:28:57,845
- I'm sure it can all be explained.
- Keep your nose out of this!

431
00:28:57,918 --> 00:29:01,547
- Frank!
- Oh. Sorry, Father. Sorry, Mother.

432
00:29:01,622 --> 00:29:03,954
Margaret.

433
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:20,868
Hey! I lost my hat!
I lost my hat!

Your cookies will be next.

435
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:28,475
- Holy Toledo! It's the same M.P.!
- I told them to wait.

436
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:31,746
- Why'd you do that?
Oh, you didn't do that!
- I'm just joking.

437
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:34,413
- Well, this ain't funny.
- That's the trick, Radar.

438
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:39,090
You sure put in a long day,
Lieutenant.

439
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:41,957
A lot of infiltrators
