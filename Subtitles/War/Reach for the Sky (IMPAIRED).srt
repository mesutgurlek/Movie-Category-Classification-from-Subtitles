00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
- Contact.
- Contact.

2
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
(engine stalls)

3
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,960
(engine starts)

4
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm just joining.

5
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,680
New cadets report at the Cadets' Mess
at the top of the road.

6
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Right. Thank you.

7
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,280
Gentlemen...

8
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,280
...atten-shun!

9
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,720
- What is your name, sir?
- Bader.

10
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,120
- Are you a comedian?
- No, sir.

11
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,120
- What is wrong with your hat?
- I can't see it, sir.

12
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,160
Take it off, sir!

13
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,840
Well?

14
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,400
I had an accident on my way here.

15
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,400
- I fell off my motorcycle.
- You fell off your motorcycle.

16
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,720
- How do you expect to fly an aeroplane?
- I expect to be taught.

17
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,600
Another funny man.
And what is your name, sir?

18
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,680
Sanderson, Flight Sergeant.

19
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,680
I bet you don't laugh so much
from now on, Mr Sanderson, sir.

20
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,280
Gentlemen...

21
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,280
...move to the right in fours. Form fours!

22
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,200
Right!

23
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,280
By the left, left wheel...

24
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,920
...quick march!

25
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,920
(Sanderson) As Douglas Bader marched
across Cranwell's parade ground...

26
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,760
...in September of 1928...

27
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,640
...I marched beside him.

28
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,960
Two young men for whom living...

29
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,960
...meant flying.

30
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,400
Douglas was airborne within days...

31
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,280
...on his first instructional flight
in an Avro 504.

32
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,040
From the very beginning,
he loved every minute of it.

33
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,280
You must relax. You're still too tensed up.

34
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Now try another turn.

35
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't shove it, guide it gently.
Feel the aeroplane's part of you.

36
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,080
That's better.

37
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm beginning to feel the plane now, sir.

38
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,800
Never call it a plane, Bader,
it's an aeroplane.

39
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,240
Yessir.

40
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,280
- I want you to try a landing.
- Right.

41
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,680
OK, you've got her.

42
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Now turn in.

43
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,120
I've got her.

44
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,640
Perhaps we'll try again tomorrow.

45
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,640
You mightn't be valuable to the Air Force,
but I am!

46
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,280
Not bad.
Three in a row without terrifying me.

47
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,760
- Thank you.
- You're nearly ready to go solo.

48
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,800
- How do you feel about it?
- Fine, sir.

49
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,680
Take off, fly a circuit and land,
then come in. I'll be watching.

50
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Very good, sir.

51
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,280
Cut back a bit!

52
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,280
(all hum "John Brown's Body" drunkenly)

53
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,400
(shouting raucously)

54
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,120
- 20 minutes late again.
- Names, gentlemen.

55
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,080
- Bader.
- Sanderson.

56
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,920
(Douglas) Bet I've written this off.

57
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,960
(Sanderson) She's okay.

58
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,400
Douglas... PC Trouble.

59
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,360
You the four who passed me in the lane?

60
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,440
- (All) No!
- Which of you owns the bike?

61
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,120
- Me. Flight Cadet Bader.
- Bayder.

62
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
Bader!

63
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Flight Cadet... Bayder.

64
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,080
It's the third time I've had you
for cycling offences.

65
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,760
- You'll get us in trouble again.
- No rear light.

66
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,120
Well, I did have.
You won't pinch me for that?

67
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,840
It's either that
or not being in proper control.

68
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,160
Don't be greedy.
I'll take the no rear light.

69
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,000
Either spells trouble.
I'll serve the summons tomorrow.

70
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,840
Nice to feel wanted!

71
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,960
You're a menace to everybody
on the road.

72
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,960
- Goodnight, officer.
- Goodnight.

73
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,560
(laughter)

74
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,720
You came here a year ago on a prize
cadetship having passed in six.

75
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,360
You've not only done no work...

76
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,360
...you seem to regard authority
as a challenge to be defied.

77
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Now this latest escapade!

78
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,920
Well, have you anything else to say?

79
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,800
l-I think it must be a reaction.

80
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,880
I've been working very hard for the exam.

81
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,120
You may be interested in the results, then.

82
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
Yessir.

83
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,360
- Out of 21 entries, you were 19th.
- Oh.

84
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,360
You fly well and you're good at games.
But it's not enough.

85
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,080
You'd better change considerably
or you'll go.

86
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,080
We don't want schoolboys in the RAF,
we want men. That's all.

87
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Yessir.

88
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,720
- How many has Bader got?
- 102. Pity it's his last game.

89
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Four more and you've beaten us.

90
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,400
(applause)

91
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,560
- Well done!
- Thanks.

92
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,640
- The postings are up.
- Are we together?

93
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,040
- Yes, at Kenley.
- 23 Squadron!

94
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,440
- Congratulations!
- And the same to you, sir!

95
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,440
Good innings.
I see you're both going to Kenley.

96
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,440
It'll keep all the trouble in one spot!

97
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,320
We'll liven things up!

98
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,960
Atten-shun!

99
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,000
General salute!

100
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
(trumpet fanfare)

101
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,280
- Sanderson.
- Yessir?

102
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,360
Was that you I saw falling out of a roll?

103
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Yessir. Actually, I didn't fall out,
I came out lower down.

104
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,480
They are different from the Gamecocks.

105
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Don't do it without plenty of height.
All of you, no low aerobatics.

106
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,640
- All right if you know your stuff.
- Two pilots were killed last month.

107
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,680
- They knew their stuff.
- They were unlucky.

108
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,360
Since the air display,
you're the worst offender.

109
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,920
Better pilots than you have died.

110
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,360
Surely we don't have to obey
all the regulations.

111
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,920
Rules are written
for the obedience of fools...

112
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,160
...and the guidance of wise men.
- Yessir.

113
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,160
Douglas, a good pilot shouldn't
have to prove it all the time.

114
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,160
I understand, sir.

115
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,160
- See you at the mess dance tonight?
- You bet, sir.

116
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
# "Love Is The Sweetest Thing"

117
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:18,320
- You're always in a hurry.
- When was I hurrying?

118
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,280
- Playing rugby for the Harlequins.
- Are you a fan?

119
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,320
You are quite a celebrity.

120
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
- What are you up to on Monday?
- Making love to Sally, I hope!

121
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,440
- Care to join Reading Aero Club?
- Yep, count me in.

122
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,360
- Where do you live, Sally?
- About 40 miles away.

123
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,240
- I'll run you home. Let's go.
- What about Johnny?

124
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,240
- Besides, there's Hilda.
- Look.

125
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,160
- I'll get my coat.
- Come on, let's go.

126
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,520
I'll wait here for you.

127
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,160
- And very nice, too.
- Hello, sir.

128
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,400
- Enjoying yourself?
- Rather!

129
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,280
I did mean what I said this afternoon.

130
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,840
About showing off? I deserved it.

131
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,840
It's dangerous to be too sure of yourself.
Just watch it.

132
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,160
- I will, sir.
- Goodnight, Douglas. Behave yourself.

133
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,120
What does he mean, behave yourself?

134
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,120
He's talking about Monday, not tonight!

135
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,200
Must be some Service boys here.

136
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,200
- That's the RAF's standard fighter.
- Terrifically fast.

137
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,640
- Hello, Jones. Just come in?
- Yes, from Heston.

138
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,880
Have you met these RAF chaps?

139
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,400
- Saw your Bulldog.
- I saw you play for Inter-Services.

140
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,400
- It's said you'll play for England.
- Well, I may be lucky.

141
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Well, well, quite the all-rounder.
Rugger, cricket, boxing, Hendon.

142
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,680
Some show you put on at Hendon!

143
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,240
- Pricky Day's a great pilot.
- We ought to go.

144
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,240
- Why don't you beat up the field?
- No chance, old boy.

145
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,120
- Come on, give us a show!
- You heard Sanderson.

146
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,120
- The CO forbids the low stuff.
- Oh (!)

147
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,440
- Come on, we ought to get back.
- Sorry.

148
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,480
These boys only perform...

149
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,480
...when there's a crowd.

150
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,880
(panicked shouting)

151
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,280
See where the ambulance is! Hurry it up!

152
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,320
Hold on, we'll have you out in a moment.

153
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Get those parachutes clear.

154
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,200
Take it easy, Douglas. They won't be long.

155
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,200
- This is damn silly. Let me get up.
- No, hold on, old boy. Lie still.

156
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,600
John... I can't feel my legs.

157
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,000
- (knock at door)
- Come in.

158
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,480
Mr Joyce, have you time to see
a young RAF officer?

159
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,480
- He's had a very bad crash.
- I have an appointment.

160
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,160
The House Surgeon says
there's very little hope.

161
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,160
- Tell Taylor I'll be delayed.
- You've only just caught him.

162
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Yes, it was lucky.
This patient needs all the luck he can get.

163
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,800
(Joyce) Pulse is stronger.
It's amazing. He should be dead.

164
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,280
- (Price) He must be fit.
- Let me see the X-rays. Right leg.

165
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Left leg.

166
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,960
Hello, you've had an accident.
Don't worry, just lie back.

167
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,960
- We'll fix you up.
- Don't give me anaesthetic, doc.

168
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
- I can't bear the stuff.
- We'll see things are all right.

169
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Relax.

170
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Now breathe... quite naturally.

171
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,000
What's the extent of his injury?

172
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Right leg's practically severed,
left leg's crushed.

173
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,400
Two ribs broken.

174
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,440
Minor facial injuries.

175
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,000
We have to work fast.
He's lost a lot of blood.

176
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't think we've got too much time.

177
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,600
I got here as fast as I could.

178
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,480
- What about his mother?
- I rang her.

179
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,560
- She'll be here tomorrow.
- Helluva mess.

180
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,560
A fellow like him
either flies that way or not at all.

181
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,440
- Oh, sister, what's happening?
- He's in theatre.

182
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,440
- How is he?
- They're amputating his right leg.

183
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,640
What a helluva thing to happen
to a man like Douglas.

184
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,160
- Sister, Mr Bader's mother's here.
- Show her into the waiting room.

185
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,400
All right, nurse,
you can take the dressings off now.

186
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,160
What am I doing here?

187
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,200
Oh, you're awake, are you?

188
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,520
- Of course I am. Where am I?
- In hospital.

189
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,080
- You had an accident.
- Accident?

190
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,080
- You crashed in an aeroplane.
- Bloody silly thing to do.

191
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,080
This is Mr Joyce.

192
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
He operated on you.

193
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,280
What did I do? Break a leg?

194
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,080
(Joyce) You broke both of them.

195
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,080
I suppose that sort of thing happens
in an aeroplane crash.

196
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,800
I'm sorry, old chap,
we had to take off the right leg.

197
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,800
- I hope I haven't been a nuisance.
- (Nurse) Ready, sister.

198
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,640
We'd better see
how the other leg's getting along.

199
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,680
This might hurt a little.

200
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,720
I can't remember anything.

201
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,760
Crashed in an aeroplane.

202
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,800
I broke both my legs.

203
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,360
Ahh!

204
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,360
There, the dressing's off.

205
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,320
Right... see you later, old chap.

206
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
All right, nurse, you can re-dress the leg.

207
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,800
Well, sir?

208
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,600
I'd better have a word
with the mother, I suppose.

209
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,600
She's in here.

210
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,400
This is Mr Joyce, the surgeon.

211
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,640
I'm Bader's uncle. This is his mother.

212
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,640
How do you do? Your son came through
the first operation very well.

213
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,920
The first operation?

214
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,200
He needs another.
The other leg's infected.

215
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm sorry... but I must have
your authority to amputate.

216
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,160
Oh, no!

217
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,800
No! (sobs)

218
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,840
What's the alternative?

219
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,880
There is no alternative if he's to live.

220
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,760
But he can't lose both legs, not both!

221
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,080
I think I can save the other
below the knee.

222
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,560
Couldn't we wait a little while?

223
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,560
- 'Fraid not.
- It's his only chance, my dear.

224
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,560
If you do it... are you sure
you'll be able to save him?

225
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,880
I can't be sure, he's very ill,
but I would like to try.

226
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,400
Very well.

227
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,440
Now, if you'll excuse me.

228
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,520
Give him my love.

229
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,880
Yes, I will.

230
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Mr Joyce will do everything possible.

231
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,200
I'm so afraid that Douglas
will hate me for ever...

232
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,840
...but I couldn't let him die.
- Of course not.

233
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,560
(Sanderson) Knowing the danger...

234
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,200
...Joyce did the second amputation
at top speed...

235
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,000
...and they wheeled Bader
back to his room.

236
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,480
Every ten minutes, day and night...

237
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,520
...they took his pulse.

238
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,280
It was there, but only just.

239
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Douglas was like a man hanging on
the edge of a precipice by his fingertips.

240
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Would he have the strength
when the anaesthetic wore off...

241
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,480
...to face the terrible weight of pain
that would fall on him?

242
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,920
Can't we give him more morphia?

243
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,400
He's had as much as we dare give.
It seems to have no effect.

244
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,880
(Douglas groans)

245
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,200
He lay there... fighting...

246
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,840
...fighting...

247
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,400
...for two days and two nights...

248
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,640
...but there was no relief
and no defence...

249
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,640
...until his body could stand no more.

250
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,160
Then came the morning
when the pain had left him.

251
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,320
He felt warm and peaceful.

252
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,160
He was, in fact...

253
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,160
...slipping away from life.

254
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,720
- (nurses laughing)
- Shh! There's a boy dying!

255
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Dying?

256
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,320
We'll see.

257
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,320
In that moment, the pain started again.

258
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,120
- Send Mrs Williams home.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,080
- How's Bader today?
- I think he's a little better.

260
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,080
- He's still in terrible pain.
- Let's take a look at him.

261
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,040
The morphia seems
to be having some effect.

262
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,360
I think he'll pull through.

263
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,160
Some of the nurses
are in quite a state about him.

264
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,440
Well, you know young nurses...

265
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,480
...and he is good-Iooking.

266
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,480
I'll see they keep their minds
on their work.

267
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,960
There's life in the patient yet.
How's your pulse rate, sister?

268
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,760
(Sanderson) Hour after hour,
for four endless days...

269
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,160
...the devoted nurses fought for his life...

270
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,960
...and, in the end, they won.

271
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,120
I came as soon as I could, sir.
How is he?

272
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,120
You can see him today.
He's made a remarkable recovery.

273
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,040
What sort of chap is he?
What are his interests?

274
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,960
Flying...

275
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,800
...and sport.

276
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,040
I was afraid of that.

277
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,080
He's always been on top in those things.

278
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,080
He's got a sort of dynamo inside
makes him show off.

279
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,520
He won't accept second best.

280
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,520
- He's going to have to accept it.
- To Douglas, that would mean failure.

281
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,600
He always has to prove himself...
otherwise he feels out of it.

282
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,400
How will he take it when
he finds out he's lost both legs?

283
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,680
You mean he doesn't know?

284
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,240
No, we haven't decided on
how best to tell him.

285
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,960
It's important
he shouldn't find out by accident.

286
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,440
Would you like me to tell him?

287
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Thank you. That's why I asked you
to come and see me.

288
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,480
There's no-one with him at the moment.

289
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,640
Hello, John.

290
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,880
Hello, Douglas.

291
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,680
You look fine.

292
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,480
The boys all send their best wishes.

293
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,120
Thanks, old boy.
Nice of you to come and see me.

294
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,760
Yes, isn't it?

295
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,240
As a matter of fact,
I've come to say goodbye.

296
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,680
What?

297
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,480
I've been posted to the Middle East.

298
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,880
Phworr.

299
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,520
Lucky devil.

300
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,840
I wish I was going with you.

301
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,280
(gasps)

302
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,640
Giving you some trouble?

303
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,480
It's the left one.

304
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,240
Hurts like hell.

305
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,120
It's bound to hurt at first, I expect.

306
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,120
Wish they'd cut it off like they did
the right one. That doesn't hurt at all.

307
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,200
Would you really like them to cut it off?

308
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I don't give a damn what they do
as long as they stop it hurting.

309
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,840
As a matter of fact, Douglas...

310
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,880
...they have taken it off.

311
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,880
Why does it hurt so much, then?

312
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,120
You had to know sometime.

313
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,840
Yes, I suppose so.

314
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,840
Thanks for telling me, John.

315
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,560
It's a bit difficult to...

316
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,280
(sobs)

317
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,280
It certainly does hurt.

318
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,520
I'll try to come and see you
tomorrow, Douglas.

319
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,320
- Well?
- Well, I told him.

320
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,320
- How did he take it?
- I think it hit him pretty hard.

321
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,280
- I'll go and see him.
- I must get back.

322
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,280
- Thanks for doing a difficult job.
- (Both) Bye.

323
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,600
I gather you've done
quite a job on me, sir.

324
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,360
Sorry, old chap.
It's a case for artificial legs.

325
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,360
They're very good these days
so don't worry too much.

326
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,600
That's all right, sir, I'm not worried.

327
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,600
I'll get some longer legs.
I've always wanted to be taller.

328
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Brace!

329
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,080
Brace!

330
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Brace!

331
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,280
Come on, look lively!

332
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,520
- Sally'll be here soon.
- Why all the excitement?

333
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,600
- I'm keen on her.
- You hardly know her!

334
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,240
What? When I met her,
I drove her home 40 miles.

335
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,880
We had punctures every other mile!

336
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,280
- She's keen about me.
- Is she?

337
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,280
She likes smoothing your fevered brow,
but it won't last.

338
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,760
- You old cynic.
- I'm practical.

339
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,920
You don't want to marry her?

340
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,920
If I marry, it'll have to be someone
I met the way I am now.

341
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,520
It's that or no-one.

342
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,960
Blazes, if no-one'll have me,
I'll marry you!

343
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,320
I wouldn't ever marry you!

344
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,080
You'd be killed in the rush!

345
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,680
- Anyone home?
- Harry Day!

346
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,160
Don and Tommy! Come on in!
This is a surprise!

347
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,360
- Well, well...
- Some goodies.

348
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,360
Tinned pears, my favourite! You know
Brace, the only woman in my life.

349
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,760
- Sally!
- How are we today?

350
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,200
- Fine, thanks.
- Are we having a party?

351
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,840
It's not a bad idea.
Don, put the gramophone on.

352
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,280
Tea for five!

353
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,000
- What do you think this is? A cafe?
- Yes, look sharp.

354
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,800
Sally, may I have the pleasure
of this dance?

355
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,280
Please do.

356
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,280
(# jazz)

357
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,160
Waltz me round the garden, Harry.

358
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,160
- I haven't had my exercise today.
- All right, I'll push you around.

359
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,680
They're holding a Court of Enquiry.

360
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,680
- Yes, they'll come to see you.
- They'll know it was my fault.

361
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,920
Don't worry about it.

362
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,920
You'd think you'd been run over
by the Air Marshal's daughter!

363
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,640
- Will they let me stay in?
- They'll just ground you.

364
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,600
Probably promote you into a staff job.

365
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,600
I couldn't stand that, Harry.
Tied to a desk all day. I'd rather die.

366
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,680
Now, Douglas...

367
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,360
I've got to fly again, old boy,
I've simply got to!

368
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,360
All right, don't get excited.
Who says you won't fly?

369
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,320
Look at Freddie West.

370
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,320
He lost a leg in the last war.
He flew solo yesterday.

371
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,400
You wait till I get my tin legs.
I'll show you.

372
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,560
Home, James.

373
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,560
We'll see.

374
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,560
No, I'm all right. Leave me alone.

375
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,720
- You're being obstinate.
- Please, Brace.

376
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,720
I've got to do it by myself.

377
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,080
How long have you been out here?

378
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,080
Only about half an hour.
I didn't hurt myself.

379
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,000
Really, you're worse than a baby.

380
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,240
- How many times did you fall?
- About six.

381
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,240
- Serves you right for rushing.
- It's this blasted peg leg.

382
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,800
- It hurts like blazes.
- I'll have a look at it inside.

383
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,040
You can't expect it to be perfect
in three days. Be patient.

384
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,000
Now, will you be warm enough?
The wind is cold.

385
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,520
I'm all right.

386
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,520
We'll put the rug round you.
I've got some news for you.

387
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,720
I've had all the news I want.
I've heard from Sally.

388
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,760
What's the matter?

389
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,920
- If you must know, she's left me.
- What?

390
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,920
She doesn't say so, but her mother's
taken her to South Africa.

391
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,520
- For a holiday?
- For heaven's sake, be your age!

392
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,520
She's not going to have her daughter
mixed up with a cripple...

393
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,200
...and she's right.

394
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,600
- You're better off without her.
- Thank you.

395
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Read about Johnson?
Crashed-killed outright, lucky devil.

396
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,000
- Don't you dare say that!
- He is lucky!

397
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,520
I'd rather be dead than like this.

398
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Listen to me. You're alive
and you're going to stay alive.

399
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,960
You can see, you can hear, you can talk.

400
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,360
Before long,
you're going to be able to walk.

401
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,360
Know something? A lot of people have
spent a great deal of time on you.

402
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,760
They've worked for you,
fought for you and prayed for you.

403
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,040
And all you can say is that
you wish you were dead.

404
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,040
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

405
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Where's that... that pamphlet?

406
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,920
You don't think they're shooting
a line, do you, Brace?

407
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,800
You really can walk on their tin legs?

408
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,840
Yes, of course.

409
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,640
Now, would you like to hear my news?

410
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,640
The Court of Enquiry have recommended
that no disciplinary action be taken.

411
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,440
- What?
- Flight Lt Day rang and told me.

412
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,680
- Said to tell you he's delighted.
- (whistles)

413
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,120
- I'm delighted, too.
- So they can't kick me out.

414
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,120
No.

415
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,400
If I'm still in the Air Force,
they can't stop me flying!

416
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,400
I'd like to see them try!

417
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,760
Thanks, Brace.
I won't let you down again, I promise.

418
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,440
I'll be leaving here soon.

419
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,200
I shall miss you.

420
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,040
Will you?

421
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,040
- Come on, twice round the garden!
- I've got work to do.

422
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,360
- I can't spend my time pushing you.
- Never mind your work, let's go.

423
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Mr Bader'll be back in a minute.
He's just gone for a walk.

424
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Cor blimey!

425
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,800
That's the point, isn't it?

426
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,960
- I think it's time we turned back.
- Yep.

427
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,960
I don't know what the devil
I'll do without you, Brace.

428
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,680
The same as ever -
exactly what you want to do.

429
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,680
- The car is here.
- Well... just a moment.

430
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,640
I shan't get another chance to say this.

431
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,160
You don't have to.

432
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,160
- You saved my life. You know that?
- Nonsense.

433
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:17,640
Yes, you did. The others cut me up,
but you put me together again.

434
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Well, let's say
we fought the battle together.

435
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,480
And we won it, didn't we?

436
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,560
Yes, we did.

437
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Dear Brace.

438
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,640
I've another patient coming in
this afternoon.

439
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,200
Your room is in a dreadful state.

440
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Another patient? Lucky man.

441
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,080
Come along.

442
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,240
Yeah.

443
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,000
Careful of those gramophone records.

444
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,160
Yes, ma'am, don't you worry.

445
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,200
Here they come, sister.

446
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,560
Come along,
you're keeping the RAF waiting.

447
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,560
- Do 'em good! What about my records?
- All aboard, sir.

448
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Ah, we're just in time. Don't worry, Bader,
this is purely a social visit.

449
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,440
We had to come and say goodbye.

450
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,440
How sweet of you, Sister Thornhill.
I'll be back soon on my tin legs.

451
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,200
- We'll have a party.
- Lovely.

452
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,000
- Come on, it's time you were off.
- Right. Well...

453
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Goodbye, doc, and thank you
for everything you've done.

454
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,160
You're going into the outside world.
You've got what it takes. Goodbye.

455
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,720
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks.

456
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Well, sister, it's a good job
I can't shake hands.

457
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,160
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

458
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,200
Now you, sister.

459
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,200
- Goodbye, and take care of yourself.
- Goodbye and thank you.

460
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,320
Now you, nurse, your turn next.

461
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,960
- Oh, permission to carry on, sister?
- (laughs)

462
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,960
Nurse Nichols. Come on, don't be shy.

463
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,960
I say, what a day this is!

464
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,960
Brace.

465
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,440
Goodbye, Brace.

466
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Good luck.

467
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,680
Thank you, Corporal. All set for take-off?

468
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,960
- Yessir.
- Good.

469
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,960
Right... Goodbye, ladies. Don't let
any of the other patients kiss you!

470
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,360
(All) Goodbye!

471
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,400
(Drill Corporal)
Squad will retire. Left... turn!

472
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,240
Oh, bust again!

473
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,240
- £52,000.02. Like a hand, Douglas?
- With you two sharks? No!

474
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,920
- (drill shouted outside)
- Shut the window.

475
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,920
Anybody'd think we were in the army.

476
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,480
How about a spin in your Bentley, Peely?
I'm bored.

477
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,960
We wouldn't make one good driver!

478
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,960
- It's against regulations.
- Good! If you're windy, I'll drive.

479
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Gentlemen,
you've found yourselves a chauffeur.

480
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,640
- Got my arm out!
- Hope Matron doesn't see us.

481
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,640
- We won't have a leg to stand on!
- Speak for yourself!

482
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,640
Open up a bit,
we're not going to a funeral! Let me!

483
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,640
If I'm to have my arm broken again,
I'd rather a surgeon did it.

484
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,280
I can use my peg leg on the clutch
and the hand throttle.

485
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,600
- What do you think, Vic?
- Well, a few more broken bones...

486
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,120
All right.

487
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,280
That's fine, Douglas,
but how are you going to stop?

488
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,000
Let's worry about that
when the time comes. Hang on!

489
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
(revs up engine)

490
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,080
I'm getting the hang of it!

491
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,080
- Yes, but how will you stop?
- Stop? You can't have everything!

492
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Look out!

493
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,600
What's your name, mate? Death?

494
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,760
- I missed him!
- Go on doing that, will you?

495
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,400
- Stand by for take-off!
- Contact.

496
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,400
Chocks away! (whistles)

497
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,560
(whistles cheerfully)

498
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,360
- Ah, tea!
- Tea? What for? I'm enjoying myself.

499
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,360
- You may be, we're not.
- Yes, pull over.

500
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,160
- Well, we made it.
- Let's have my prop.

501
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,400
Thanks.

502
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,560
Where are we going? There?

503
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Poor dear.

504
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,360
I bet you could do with a cuppa!

505
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,680
- Three teas.
- Cream or plain?

506
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,160
Cream. Not a conversationalist,
but very nice.

507
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,160
- I wonder if there are any more like her.
- Aye-aye!

508
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,800
Hey, what sort of place is this?

509
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,800
- I thought you were off.
- I'll just serve those three boys.

510
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,440
- (laughs) Want any help?
- No, thanks, I can manage.

511
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,360
I was a bit worried about Paddy.

512
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,360
I noticed we were getting too close
for comfort, so Danny...

513
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,920
- You seem to have crashed.
- It's a habit.

514
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,880
If you take your plane off the table...

515
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,520
I'm so sorry.

516
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,400
Do you mind if I leave the bill?
I'm going off now.

517
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,400
You ought to do that, too,
then we'll both have good luck.

518
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,680
- I wonder if she's got a sister.
- No, a brother, six-foot-four (!)

519
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,400
- She's left her pencil.
- I'll take it.

520
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,400
- He doesn't miss a trick!
- Swindler!

521
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,280
- Pour the tea, be back in a sec.
- Will you be mum? No, perhaps not.

522
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,240
You forgot your pencil.

523
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,080
Oh, thank you.

524
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,080
It's a pleasure.

525
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,480
How did you get on, Douglas?

526
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,440
I'm going to ask that girl out one day.

527
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,840
- No time like the present.
- Go on, Douglas.

528
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,840
Oh, I don't know,
I don't suppose she'd want to...

529
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,800
You just wait till I find my feet.

530
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,520
(Desoutter) Bring the other leg.
Get this foot firmly on the ground.

531
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,080
Let's get moving, boys,
I'm going to a dance.

532
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,120
Try and stand on this one.

533
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:04,120
Can I have the crutches, please?

534
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,480
Thank you.

535
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,560
Feels good.
Much better than the peg leg.

536
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,320
Right, we'll try a step, shall we?

537
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Right, here goes.

538
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,520
Lift your leg a little higher
to keep your toe clear.

539
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,800
Right.

540
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,840
- How's that?
- Well done.

541
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,800
Now let's have a shot at the right leg.

542
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,440
Thank you.

543
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,440
Take those.

544
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,360
- All right, Walker, you'd better slip it on.
- Very good, sir.

545
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,920
I didn't expect all this harness,
Mr Desoutter.

546
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,920
You'll feel a bit like a parcel,
but your right stump's weak...

547
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,520
...after doing nothing for six months.

548
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,400
You need all the support you can get.

549
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,400
- That's it. Pass those crutches.
- Try standing without them.

550
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,280
All right.

551
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Good. Now let's have a go, shall we?

552
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,560
Good Lord, this is impossible!

553
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,600
That's what they all say the first time.

554
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,600
I thought I'd walk out tonight,
be running about in a fortnight.

555
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,840
I think you ought to face it,
you'll never walk again without a stick.

556
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,200
I'll never walk with one!

557
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,840
No-one with your disability has...

558
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:34,200
- What's that got to do with it?
- All right.

559
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,200
Let's try a step or two.

560
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,920
What do I do? It's impossible!

561
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,920
Try kicking the right stump forward
as if you were cracking a whip.

562
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,800
Very good.

563
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,520
Come on.

564
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,560
My God, I can't move!

565
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,560
Don't panic. You've no toe or ankle muscles
to spring you forward.

566
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,600
You must learn to do without them.

567
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,280
Pull me over this damn leg.

568
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,760
Pull me again, for God's sake.

569
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,760
Now let's turn.

570
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,760
Push harder on my right side.

571
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,760
Again.

572
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,320
You'd better have a rest now, sir.

573
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,280
- I'll never get it.
- Yes, you will.

574
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,680
It'll take time.
See what six months will do.

575
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,320
Six months?

576
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,640
You know... you'd find a stick very useful.

577
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,800
No stick, not me, never.

578
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,800
- Come on, let's have another go.
- Take shorter steps, it's easier.

579
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,040
A bit better.
Shorter steps seem to be the secret.

580
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,040
Taking half an inch off the right leg
might make it easier.

581
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,560
- How long will it take?
- Half an hour.

582
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,560
I've got to see a girl in a few days.
I want to be walking by then.

583
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,040
All right, we'll make it 20 minutes.

584
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,640
- Haven't you done enough, sir?
- Good idea, that half inch off.

585
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,200
That'll do for today.
You'd better be getting back.

586
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,760
I'm not going home
until I can walk on my own.

587
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,240
All right, if you think you can.

588
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,280
Now let me go.

589
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,360
Now stand back, all of you.

590
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,360
I want to do this on my own.

591
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,800
You know what you can do
with your damn sticks!

592
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,360
- You did tremendously well.
- Can I take them?

593
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,080
You'd better come here to practise.

594
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,040
They're expecting me at Uxbridge
on my own two feet.

595
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,040
You'll get your legs soon enough.
Come on, let's give him a cup of tea.

596
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,560
(Thelma squeals and laughs)

597
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,520
- Wasn't that awful!
- I must go, I'm terribly late.

598
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,760
See you on Thursday. Bye-bye.

599
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,160
- Don't forget your coat.
- Bye.

600
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,160
Bye.

601
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,200
- Hello.
- Hello. Is that your boyfriend?

602
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,040
- No, my cousin.
- Ahh!

603
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,280
Um... do you ever go out in the evenings?

604
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,440
- Well, I do sometimes.
- Oh.

605
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,840
How would you like
to come out with me one night?

606
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,480
I don't know you.

607
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,520
I don't know you, but I'll take a chance.

608
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,520
I'm getting new legs -
I must have somebody to dance with.

609
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,880
- I don't know your name.
- Douglas Bader.

610
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,280
- I'm Thelma Edwards.
- Join me?

611
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,000
- I don't...
- There's nobody about.

612
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
All right.

613
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,400
- Will you take tea?
- Thank you.

614
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,400
Cream or plain?

615
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,200
You're going to be about an inch shorter.

616
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,760
My new girlfriend's not very big.

617
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,760
If you get a change of heart, come back.
We'll make you taller!

618
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,920
It's still difficult, but it's easier
than it was three weeks ago.

619
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,280
You're making wonderful progress.

620
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,280
Now away you go, boys,
let's have another go on my own.

621
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,280
Done it!

622
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,320
How the devil do I turn?

623
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,320
It's something you have to practise.
It's the hardest one of all.

624
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,280
We'll see about that.

625
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,880
There you are, they're all yours.
You've found your feet again.

626
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,680
It's a bit soon to let you have 'em
but you'll only complain if I don't.

627
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,320
- Shall I wrap them for you?
- No! I'm walking out on 'em!

628
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,720
Ah-ah.

629
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,920
It not only looks good, it feels good.

630
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,760
You look fine.

631
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,840
Mr Walker, put that back in the cupboard!

632
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,960
Now, what about a stick?

633
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,680
No, I'll go on the way I've started.

634
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:48,240
Don't expect too much.
You've done darn well.

635
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,960
- Thanks for putting up with me.
- Car's waiting.

636
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,960
Goodbye, sir.

637
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,880
- Goodbye, Mr Walker.
- Good luck, sir.

638
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,520
Mr Tullitt.

639
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,000
- Come back if you have any trouble.
- I will.

640
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,640
Goodbye.

641
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,640
Thank you.

642
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,240
Hello, Douglas! Let's give you a hand.

643
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,040
- I can manage!
- Don't be so touchy.

644
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,920
Sorry, Peely,
I've got to work this out for myself.

645
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,560
Long John Silver's
got his undercarriage back!

646

(babble of voices)

647
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,360
- How goes it, Douglas?
- I've got 'em.

648
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,360
- I look normal if I don't move!
- Do a circuit, Douglas.

649
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,280
Well, I'm flaked out,
I've just climbed the stairs.

650
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,640
Bet you five shillings
you don't make your own bed.

651
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,480
You're on!

652
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,240
- Hold those, Peely.
- Come on!

653
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,240
- Come on, Douglas, you can make it.
- (shouts of encouragement)

654
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,600
I'll take the boy with the tin legs!

655
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,680
- Slow.
- That's it, boy, you'll make it.

656
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,000
- Don't weaken, Dougie, come on!
- Watch it.

657
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,040
- Yes, steady.
- I get my leg next week.

658
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,880
There goes my five bob.

659
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,880
- Come on, try, man, try!
- Dougie's coming up.

660
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,680
(cheering)

661
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,560
You can go and pick up that five bob!

662
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,560
- You all right, sir?
- My stumps hurt like the devil.

663
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,640
- I must've rubbed the skin off.
- You're overdoing it.

664
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,680
If they're going to chafe,
how can I walk very far?

665
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,080
I'll put some sticking plaster
on the stumps.

666
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,080
- Good idea. Then I'll try again.
- That wasn't what I meant.

667
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,720
Never mind that, I'm telling you
what I want. Get that plaster.

668
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,480
- Where's your boyfriend these days?
- What boyfriend?

669
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,520
- The boy who had the accident.
- I hardly know him.

670
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,520
- I thought he asked you out.
- That was some time ago.

671
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,080
Maybe he can't get around much.

(# jazz on gramophone)

673
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:00,440
Oh, blast!

674
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,240
- Are you all right?
- That's enough, Douglas!

675
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,200
- You've been at it all afternoon.
- Let's sit down.

676
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Let me go, boys,
I've got to get the hang of it.

677
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,880
Don't bust yourself, she'll wait.

678
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,880
I can't go and see the girl like this.

679
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,240
(Douglas whistles cheerfully)

680
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,040
Look, boys, no hands!

681
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,360
- Is this the big day?
- It is.

682
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:33,600
Change your socks.
It's getting noticeable.

683
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,600
- I've had my shoes on for two weeks.
- Send your legs to the laundry!

684
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,640
- John, what news of the leg?
- It'll be stiff for good.

685
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,560
There you are, what did I tell you?

686
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:49,280
Have it off, old boy, have it off!

687
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,280
Ah, here we go.

688
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,280
- All ready for you, sir.
- Good.

689
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,280
Be careful. They can't put a tin head
on you. Hang onto the wooden one!

690
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,320
- Wish me luck.
- Give her my love.

691
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,320
Fat chance of that!

692
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,800
- Blimey, he'll take off in a minute.
- That's one thing he'll never do.

693
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,720
Not any more.

694
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:24,120
Hello.

695
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,480
I'll bring it straight away, madam.

696
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,040
- We've had our tea.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

697
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,880
- You look wonderful.
- I was going to say that about you.

698
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,800
Thank you.

699
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,440
(Both) I...

700
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,440
I know a wonderful place for dinner.
Like to come out and celebrate?

701
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,240
Celebrate? Oh...

702
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,880
I'd love to.

703
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,040
- When do you finish?
- 6 o'clock.

704
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,160
- I'll pick you up.
- Thank you.

705
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,160
All right you talking about dinner,
I haven't had my tea yet.

706
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,160
She won't be long.

707
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,160
Leave a good tip.

00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Nothing much happened till I met you.
Well, one or two things.

711
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,640
- We must do this again. In London?
- Yes, I'd like to.

712
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,440
I won't be here much longer
now I'm more mobile.

713
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,840
- I'm going to Kenley next week.
- 23 Squadron.

714
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,640
- How did you know?
- My father was a Wing Commander.

715
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,680
I've got three cousins in the Air Force.

716
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,200
- I know more about you than you think.
- I shall have to be more careful.

717
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:17,160
- Why didn't you say?
- You didn't give me a chance.

718
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,040
What are you doing at that restaurant?

719
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,040
Some friends run it, I was helping.
I'm leaving on Friday.

720
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,480
I'm rather sorry, it's been great fun.

721
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,640
Mightn't going back to Kenley
depress you?

722
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,280
Why should it?
I'm going to stay in the RAF and fly.

723
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,760
- Haven't you had enough of flying?
- No fear!

724
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,760
I've had my crash now.
Anyway, I've got no more legs to lose!

00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,200

Why not?

- Nor me yet.

If I trip, I'll hang onto you.

- You've been wonderful company.

- Good. Why's it all so quiet?

- Fine.

- All set?
- All set.

- Blast!
- What's the matter?

01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,520
Bit of cramp, I think. Both wrists.
Too much office work!

- Thanks, Harry! Hang on to your hat!

769
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,840
That was a nice take-off.

770
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:42,240
Just the same as it always was.

771
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,280
No aerobatics, now.

772
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:48,040
- What's that?
- I said, no aerobatics!

773
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:52,040
I'm sorry, I can't hear!

774
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:07,800
Sorry you've had to wait so long, sir.
Shouldn't be long now.

775
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,520
It'll be worth waiting for.

776
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,160
- How was Central Flying School?
- I enjoyed it.

777
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,160
- Heard anything about my medical?
- The Wing Commander knows.

778
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,120
Hope I go to my old squadron.

779
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:25,120
Mr Bader, Wing Commander Hargreaves
will see you now.

780
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:29,160
Good luck, sir.

781
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,840
- Afternoon, Bader.
- Afternoon, sir.

782
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:39,160
Sit down.
Sorry we kept you waiting so long.

783
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,160
Was my report from Central Flying School
satisfactory?

784
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:47,240
Your instructor said
he couldn't teach you about flying.

785
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,280
In fact, you taught him a thing or two.

786
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,960
Unfortunately,
we can't pass you fit for flying.

787
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,520
Nothing in King's Regulations
covers your case.

788
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,520
But I was sent to the Central Flying
School to see if I could fly!

789
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:15,200
- It's not my decision.
- They expected me to fail.

790
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,000
I'm sorry it's turned out like this.

791
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,400
You mean I'm grounded for good?

792
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,000
I'm afraid so.

793
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
- There must be some alternative.
- You can go on the retired list.

794
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,800
Leave on the grounds of ill health.

795
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,800
- Sell bootlaces on the street (?)
- You'd have your retired pay...

796
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,800
...and no doubt a total disability pension.

797
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,800
Yes, that just about says it all.

798
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:48,360
You don't have to make up your mind now.
Take your time. After all...

799
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,600
Yessir, thank you.

800
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,760
They failed me.

801
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,920
- Well, it's all over.
- Why, what happened?

802
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,920
The book doesn't say anything
about people like me flying, that's all.

803
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:29,240
- Does that mean no more flying?
- Yes.

804
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,920
You'll still have a career in the Service.

805
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:36,920
Thelma, I won't take a ground job.
If I can't fly, I'll leave.

806
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,480
There are other things besides flying.

807
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,120
For instance?

808
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,400
Us.

809
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,400
I'm not much of a proposition.
No money, no job, no legs.

810
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,120
- We'll make out.
- We'll have a darn good try!

811
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,240
(bugler plays)

812
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,000
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye, Bates.

813
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,960
Good luck.
Hope you find the job you're looking for.

814
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,960
- (plane flies overhead)
- Yes... thanks.

815
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,640
- Dear sir...
- You haven't given me the address.

816
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,280
What? Oh... er... Melbourne office.

817
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,920
Dear sir...

818
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,400
...um...

819
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,440
No smoking, Mr Bader.

820
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,800
Oh.

821
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,200
Dear sir, with regard to your...
Delete that.

822
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:26,200
Bader, this letter you wrote earlier
is a little abrupt.

823
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,320
- Sorry, what's the matter?
- It's like a telegram.

824
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,960
Wrap it up a bit -
such as "we would suggest".

825
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:36,280
"Perhaps you've considered."

826
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,440
I write letters people can understand.

827
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,280
- Get used to different ways here.
- Right.

828
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:46,240
- Where were we?
- Dear sir.

829
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:50,240
Reference is made to your...
We beg to point out. That's polite.

830
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,120
We beg to point out that reference
is made to your communication...

831
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:00,200
(Sanderson) The routine of his new job
made each day seem a month.

832
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:03,720
He was the prisoner of his legs.

833
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,600
Then he found what he needed
- A new challenge.

834
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,600
- Good shot, Adrian.
- Well done!

835
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,680
- You're a good 20 yards up on me.
- Walk round with us, Douglas?

836
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,640
We'll stay here and potter around.
Leave me a club and a ball.

837
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,840
- Give me a niblick.
- Here, sir.

838
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,240
This one cuts more grass
than my lawn mower!

839
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,400
- Ball, ball!
- Oh, yes.

840
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:32,000
Ta.

841
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
- How's it feel?
- Not bad.

842
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,760
- Can't be all that difficult.
- Oh, do be careful, Douglas!

843
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:49,480
Now, then, let's see about this.

844
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:52,480
Oh, Douglas! (laughs)

845
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,480
I kept my head down, anyway!
Don't worry, I'm not hurt.

846
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,200
The going's pretty soft.

847
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:03,200
All right, stand back a bit.

848
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,800
- I'm all right, I'm all right!
- Let's go and have some tea.

849
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:16,440
It's just a question of balance.
Nothing to it. Get back a bit.

850
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,240
Now, keep still, you little devil, keep still.

851
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,720
Ahhh... I moved it!

852
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,720
Did you see that, darling?
Only five yards, but I moved it!

853
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:36,200
- Well done, darling.
- Fetch it, will you?

854
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,280
Now, then, let's have another go.

855
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,320
Pop it down there. Stand back. Bit more.

856
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:47,320
Tee it up a bit. You're allowed to
on the tees, anyway. Back a bit.

857
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,160
Ahh...!

858
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:57,840
I hit it!
Slap bang in the middle of the club!

859
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:01,840
- I hope you're satisfied!
- Not by a long chalk!

860
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,880
- You won't be beaten, will you?
- Not by a ruddy golf ball!

861
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:09,320
No, Douglas, come and sit down,
have a rest.

862
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:10,960
All right.

863
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,680
You know, darling,
this is a game I could play...

864
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:16,720
...and on equal terms, too.

865
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,520
No favours.

866
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,240
- I like you looking after me.
- Somebody has to.

867
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:27,240
- You have to be fit for work.
- Why worry for £200 a year?

868
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,960
Less £2 for last night
and £5 last weekend.

869
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,360
That leaves £193 -
more than most people get.

870
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:37,760
I don't suppose
they drink champagne, though.

871
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,800
Your trouble is you've got a conscience.

872
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,280
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- I don't mind.

873
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,320
I wouldn't change you.

874
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:48,160
Thelma, we ought
to think about getting married.

875
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:52,160
That's what I like about you,
you're so passionate (!)

876
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,240
Well... I'm sorry...

877
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,720
- But what else does one say?
- You could...

878
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,720
I won't be much better off for years
so let's take a chance.

879
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:06,280
- The most romantic proposal ever (!)
- Good, then that's settled.

880
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:11,240
Now let's have another whack
at that golf ball.

881
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,960
Sorry, darling, no crossed swords,
no guard of honour.

882
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:28,040
- It was all so quick I hardly feel married.
- We'll do it in church one day.

883
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,440
I'm happy just as it is.

884
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:35,440
- You never thought I'd settle down.
- For a pipe and the fireside?

885
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,520
Yes, bung on the old slippers,
it's me for the quiet life!

886
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:48,160
(Sanderson) Thelma knew that in golf,
as in everything...

887
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,240
...he would drive himself too hard.

888
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,280
But she also knew why.

889
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,600
He might not be flying,
but he was fighting.

890
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,080
He fought 18, sometimes 36,
holes in a day...

891
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,920
...and he beat them.

892
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,800
So life for Douglas Bader
achieved some sort of compromise.

893
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,800
It might've continued but, in 1939...

894
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,800
(air-raid siren)

895
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:18,040
(air-raid siren continues)

896
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,800
Dead on time. You must be keen.
I'll take you round now.

897
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,040
- Have any trouble?
- He said he'd be delighted to see you.

898
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:31,080
- Did you put in a good word?
- Of course.

899
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,640
- We're short of aeroplanes.
- So?

900
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:37,120
- You were careless with them.
- But I've changed.

901
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,120
So have the aeroplanes!

902
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,360
You remember Bader, sir.

903
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,400
Remember you?

904
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,160
I nearly kicked you both
out of Cranwell once.

905
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:51,200
Good luck, Douglas.

906
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,600
- Hello, sir.
- Nice to see you again.

907
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,840
Good of you to see me so promptly.

908
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,840
I'm always interested in my old boys.
I gather you want a job.

909
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,560
- What sort of job would you like?
- Flying, of course.

910
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:08,720
Oh... I'm very sorry,
I'm only dealing with ground jobs.

911
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,000
That's no good to me, sir,
I'm a trained pilot.

912
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,880
- In the circumstances...
- Sir, it's difficult...

913
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,880
...but I've got to get back again
and only you can help me!

914
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,920
I must fly!

915
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:26,920
I beg your pardon, sir,
but... I've got to fly again.

916
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:33,680
Tell you what I'll do, I'll give you
a note for the medical people.

917
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,720
Excuse me, please. Thank you.

918
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,280
- Mr Blake.
- Hello, sir.

919
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:46,280
- What is it this time?
- The same. They'll pass me now.

920
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,680
- Not for flying, sir, never.
- We'll see.

921
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:53,680
We'll get you through the doctor's
as soon as we can.

922
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:57,600
- They'll never let you fly.
- How are you keeping?

923
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,600
You seem to be 100 % fit...
apart from your legs.

924
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,080
- It's not fair to drag them in, sir.
- Why not?

925
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:08,800
It's like saying a man's fit
apart from a cold...

926
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,960
...when he hasn't got a cold.

927
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,600
Or a Flying Officer's sane
when he has no brain.

928
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,600
- Yessir.
- But legs can't just be ignored.

929
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
(whistles to himself)

930
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:47,240
Have you read this
from Air Vice-Marshal Halahan?

931
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,960
He seems to be on your side.

932
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,600
Yessir.

933
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,600
Let's leave it to the Central Flying
School to assess your capabilities.

934
01:15:58,080 --> 01:15:59,720
If I pass again?

935
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:03,360
You can shake the moths
out of your old uniform.

936
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,400
- Thank you, sir.
- All the best to you.

937
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,400
Thank you.

938
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,160
Excuse me.

939
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,800
Mr Blake!

940
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,800
- Sir?
- Where can I buy a Spitfire?

941
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:54,200
Good fun, Douglas. As for your idea,
the attack formation, I see your point.

942
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,000
- Why don't we all do it?
- Hold your horses.

943
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,080
- It's not in the book.
- Blast the book!

944
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,880
Nobody knows if it's right or wrong.

945
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,200
The chaps in the last war did.

946
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,040
Mark my words,
their tactics will be successful again.

947
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,760
- Maybe you're right.
- I know I am!

948
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,000
Let's go have some breakfast.

949
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,080
- You can soon test your theories.
- Why?

950
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,360
Tubby wants you as a Flight Commander.

951
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,600
- But what about the AOC?
- He's agreed.

952
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,640
What!

953
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,120
- I can still stay at Duxford?!
- Uh-huh.

954
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:32,120
- (men shout)
- What's got into the boys?

955
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,000
- Paddy, what's happening?
- It's on, sir!

956
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Jerry's invaded France
and the Low Countries.

957
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:46,320
Good. Now we can really get at 'em.

958
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,520
(knock at door)

959
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,320
- Sir... sir.
- Mm?

960
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,640
There's a flap on, sir.
Squadron's taking off at 4.

961
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:09,640
- What time is it?
- 3 o'clock, sir.

962
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,160
- Get your legs on!
- What's up?

963
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:15,200
We're flying to Dunkirk-an evacuation.

964
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:17,240
Evacuation? Phew!

965
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,760
This could be it.

966
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,600
Good luck, Douglas.

967
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,600
Good luck, chum.

968
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:28,600
- Send in a cup of tea!
- Right.

969
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:52,840
"Enemy aircraft, enemy aircraft ahead."

970
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,160
(rapid gunfire)

971
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:21,800
(rapid gunfire)

972
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,160
- Any luck, Dave?
- No. How about you, Douglas?

973
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:44,680
Got a One-0-Nine south of Dunkirk,
smashed his tail.

974
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:48,480
- Cut it off like a knife!
- I saw. You fixed him!

975
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,360
- Everyone back?
- The CO of 19 Squadron's missing.

976
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:56,360
- Johnny Sanderson?
- I saw a Spitfire go down in smoke.

977
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,400
- What happened?
- I couldn't see how it finished.

978
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,040
Poor old John.

979
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:06,040
He'll turn up in a day or two,
having hopped a boat from Dunkirk!

980
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Got a good squirt at a One-0-Nine,
bits flew off-a "probable".

981
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,400
I've been hearing of your work
as a Flight Commander...

982
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:24,360
...so I'm giving you a Squadron - 242.

983
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,400
Yessir. Thank you, sir.

984
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:29,040
You don't seem pleased. What's up?

985
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,040
Sir, I broke a Spitfire last night,
overshot the landing.

986
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:37,320
- You won't have heard about it yet.
- You're lucky.

987
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,880
Your new squadron has Hurricanes.

988
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,440
Your pilots are mostly Canadians.

989
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:46,440
They've had a rough time in France.
They're fed up with authority.

990
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,480
They want good leadership.

991
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:53,480
- You might be the man.
- I understand, sir. I'll do my best.

992
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,720
Well, good luck.

993
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:58,520
We'll need every squadron we've got.

994
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:02,520
The Luftwaffe's gathering
across the Channel.

995
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Hey, you chaps, come on.

996
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,800
- Brace yourselves. New CO's here.
- Arrived, has he?

997
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,960
- Be here at any moment.
- What's he like?

998
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,680
Brace yourselves. He's got no legs.

999
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:31,680
- Whaddaya mean?!
- He's got a couple of tin ones.

1000
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,720
Great, now we carry a passenger
in the driver's seat.

1001
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,960
Who's in charge here?

1002
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,800
Who's the senior man?

1003
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,600
Is anyone in charge?

1004
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,040
I guess I am.

1005
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,160
What's your name?

1006
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,800
Turner.

1007
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,800
Turner what?!

1008
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:13,160
Sir.

1009
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:37,440
Start her up.
Come on, come on, jump to it!

1010
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:53,240
Not bad... not bad at all.

1011
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:59,160
Peter, I want to see all pilots
in my office in an hour.

1012
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,920
Yessir.

1013
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:04,920
It's not smart to walk around
looking like mechanics!

1014
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,840
A good squadron is a smart squadron...

1015
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,880
...and I want this to be a good squadron.

1016
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,960
You're the scruffiest lot I've ever seen.

1017
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:17,840
And no more sweaters
and flying boots in the mess.

1018
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,840
When you're not flying,
you'll wear shoes, shirts and ties. Clear?

1019
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:26,200
Most of us haven't got shoes,
shirts and ties.

1020
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,600
- Why?
- We lost them in France.

1021
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:32,040
That's not all.
Half our boys were casualties.

1022
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:35,520
We scrounged food
and slept under the aircraft.

1023
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:39,520
- We were shunted all over.
- We had to search for petrol to take off.

1024
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:44,360
We got bust up,
made our own way back to England.

1025
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,080
And then they sent us up here.

1026
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:51,080
- We're no better off.
- We should've stayed in France.

1027
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:55,200
- (murmurs of agreement)
- All right.

1028
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,880
I'm sorry. I apologise for my remarks.

1029
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:01,880
Go to Norwich,
order what you want from the tailor's.

1030
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,440
I'll guarantee the bill is paid.

1031
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:08,440
We've also been trying to get tools
for the aircraft. But nothing happens.

1032
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,760
- You haven't got any?
- Crowley-Milling has a penknife.

1033
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
We'll see about that.

1034
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:26,680
- Mr West, what's our equipment state?
- 18 Hurricanes.

1035
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,760
- But we have no tools?
- Lost in France.

1036
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,760
- Put in for more?
- Yes, through the usual channels.

1037
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:37,040
- Well?
- Channels seem to be clogged, sir.

1038
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:41,040
Oh, are they?
Well, we'll ruddy well unclog 'em.

1039
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,880
Listen, it's in Section 2, Sub-clause 4.

1040
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,840
It states that airmen only get one issue.

1041
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,880
Mugs, one, knives, one...

1042
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,880
- I want the tools for 242 Squadron.
- I can't produce them on demand.

1043
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:58,120
- What's the hold-up?
- The paperwork...

1044
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:02,120
To blazes with your paperwork!
I want that stuff fast!

1045
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:06,000
The book says I must wait
three months before I...

1046
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,720
Fine! We'll ask Goering
not to invade for three months!

1047
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:10,760
Sir...!

1048
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:14,760
I want those tools
and I want them quick!

1049
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:19,960
- Thomas, been working all night?
- Yessir.

1050
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,720
- Had breakfast?
- Yes, sir.

1051
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,720
Good show.

1052
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:29,520
Ah, just on my way to find you, sir.

1053
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,520
The boys are fit, but we've no tools
so I've sent this signal to Group.

1054
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:38,920
"242 operational as regards pilots,
but non-operational...

1055
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,760
...as regards equipment."

1056
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,920
What?

1057
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:46,920
- You should've sent it to me first.
- I'll take any kicks coming, sir.

1058
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,040
- You can't do this!
- I've done it.

1059
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:55,000
- There'll be a row at Group.
- And at Fighter Command.

1060
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Your squadron will either get
new equipment or a new CO.

1061
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:03,240
I don't know which.
Better be available for the C-in-C.

1062
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:07,400
Yessir. I'll be in my office.

1063
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,040
Same old trouble-fingers.

1064
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:15,040
Seriously, I think the book's wrong
about fighter tactics.

1065
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:19,440
Principles that paid off in the last war
are still good today.

1066
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:23,680
The chap who's got the height
controls the battle...

1067
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:27,560
...especially if he comes out
of the sun and the...

1068
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:31,560
- Fighter Command HQ on the phone.
- Spares and tools.

1069
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:36,200
This is it.

1070
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,080
Bader.

1071
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:43,080
Squadron Leader Edwards.
What's the meaning of this signal?

1072
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:47,440
This squadron is out of action
until I get some tools.

1073
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:51,440
- You can operate with what you've got.
- I've told you what I want.

1074
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:56,280
Until I get it, this squadron
remains non-operational.

1075
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,320
You don't seem to care,
but this will bring you a lot of trouble.

1076
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:05,280
- The Commander-in-Chief's furious.
- "Oh, clot!"

1077
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,920
Well, that's telling 'em, skipper.

1078
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,920
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

1079
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:18,560
Squadron Leader Bader...

1080
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:22,560
...the Commander-in-Chief
will see you now, sir.

1081
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:43,120
What is all this about equipment
and your signal?

1082
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,000
I've done all I could
to get my spares and tools.

1083
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,000
If the Germans attack, my Squadron
would soon be unable to fly.

1084
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,200
I see.

1085
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:56,200
And those remarks on the telephone
to Squadron Leader Edwards.

1086
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,440
Did you think that would help?

1087
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:03,240
It was an argument between
officers of equal rank.

1088
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,800
He tried to shake me
by saying you'd be furious.

1089
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,840
He said I was furious?

1090
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,840
I won't have officers taking my name
in vain or predicting my emotions.

1091
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,480
- I'll see Edwards later.
- Very good, sir.

1092
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:21,480
You must not short-circuit
the usual channels, Bader.

1093
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,520
No, sir.

1094
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:28,520
What exactly do you want?

1095
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,600
- Satisfied, Mr West?
- I can service all the planes, sir.

1096
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,040
Never call it a plane. It's an aeroplane.

1097
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,880
Sorry, sir, aeroplane.

1098
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:01,880
Inform Group and Fighter Command -
242 Squadron fully operational.

1099
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,920
Turner, round up the boys.
Take-off, 30 minutes, battle practice.

1100
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:16,080
Some passenger!

1101
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:20,080
Legs or no legs, I've never seen
such a fireball. Come on, Crow.

1102
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:25,560
(All) # Do you know the muffin man,
do you know the muffin man

1103
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,760
# Who lives down Drury Lane? Hey!

1104
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,760
- # Yes, I know the muffin man...
- (shouts of encouragement)

1105
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:35,000
- Watch it! He made it!
- (raucous shouts)

1106
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,000
(All) # Do you know the muffin man,
do you know the muffin man

1107
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:43,720
# Do you know the muffin man
who lives down Drury Lane? Hey!

1108
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,160
# Yes, I know the muffin man...

1109
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:49,480
(song drowned out by laughter)

1110
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:53,480
(shouts of encouragement)

1111
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:57,720
- Well, what do you think of 'em?
- They're eating out of your hand.

1112
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,880
At least they're not biting it now.
Good bunch, coming along nicely.

1113
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,600
You're longing for more fighting, aren't you?

1114
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,000
Hey, fellas, shut up! Shut up!

1115
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:13,000
(Churchill) "The Battle of Britain
is about to begin."

1116
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:17,080
"Upon this battle depends the survival
of Christian civilisation."

1117
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,520
"The whole fury and might
of the enemy...

1118
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,520
...must very soon be turned on us."

1119
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:29,600
"Hitler knows that he will have to break us
in this island or lose the war."

1120
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,800
"If we can stand up to him,
all Europe may be free."

1121
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,000
"But if we fail...

1122
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
...then the whole world,
including the United States...

1123

...including all that we have known
and cared for...

1124
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,920
...will sink into the abyss
of a new dark age."

1125
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:57,160
"Let us therefore brace ourselves
to our duty...

1126
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,400
...so bear ourselves...

1127
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:03,400
...that if the British Empire
and its Commonwealth...

1128
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:06,680
...lasts for a thousand years...

1129
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:09,280
...men will still say...

1130
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:13,280
...this was their finest hour."

1131

(Radio) "Here is the 1 o'clock news.
This is John Snagge reading it."

"At 11 o'clock this morning, enemy bombers
attacked a convoy in the English Channel...

1133

...and three seaport towns
on the South Coast."

1134
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:51,160
"Some damage was done to the ports
and there were some casualties."

1135
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:56,320
"Five enemy aircraft were shot down,
two of our aircraft are missing..."

1136
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,680
Controller, quickly.
Turn that damn thing off!

1137
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,520
(phone rings)

1138
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,160
Woodhall.

1139
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:14,160
Woody, Douglas Bader here.
Has the balloon gone up?

1140
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,200
Looks like it, Douglas.

1141
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:19,280
What are we waiting for?
When do we go?

1142
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:23,280
Hold your horses. I can't bring
you chaps in until they reach our area.

1143
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,080
The south needs every fighter it can get!

1144
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:31,520
If we go there,
Jerry will attack the Midlands.

1145
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,920
Are we supposed to do nothing?!

1146
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,920
Just take it easy,
the war won't finish overnight.

1147
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:46,080
Hello, Mrs Richards, how are you?
Nice to see you.

1148
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:50,080
Keep an eye on John, one of our
new WAAFs seems keen about him.

1149
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,440
Well, sir, seems to have started.

1150
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:57,080
Yes. This party might be the last
for some time.

1151
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,640
I agree with you, sir. Excuse me.

1152
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:03,640
Cheer up, Dicky boy! Why so gloomy?
Stan, keep an eye on him.

1153
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:07,760
- Hello, darling.
- I didn't know if you'd be here.

1154
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:11,760
Johnny Sanderson's mother rang.
He's safe, a prisoner.

1155
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:13,880
I knew it! Thank God.

1156
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:17,880
Poor John. Won't be long before
he escapes! I beg your pardon.

1157
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:21,680
- Come on in.
- Squadron Leader Bader, sir?

1158
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:24,480
We're posted to you, sir. I'm Jones.

1159
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:28,360
- How do you do?
- This is Pilot Officer Nicholson.

1160
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:31,840
- How do you do, sir?
- Stan, two more for us!

1161
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,440
Get 'em a drink. See you later.

1162
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,160
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

1163
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,640
Douglas, they look so young.

1164
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,520
They'll be all right. I'll look after them.

1165
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:45,760
Who'll look after you? You're not immortal.

1166
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,760
I've an engine in front of me, armour plate
behind, and tin legs underneath.

1167
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:55,480
How the devil can they get me?

1168
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,920
(engine whines)

1169
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:14,240
(explosions)

1170
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:21,880
(phone rings)

1171
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:27,720
242 Squadron.

1172
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:33,880
Clothing parade, 1530.

1173
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,080
Uh-huh, here it comes.

1174
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:53,080
They'll be asking for reinforcements
down south any moment.

1175
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,880
(phone buzzes)

1176
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,280
Operations.

1177
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,640
Yessir!

1178
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:07,360
(phone rings)

1179
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,760
242.

1180
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:13,760
- Squadron, scramble!
- (cheering)

1181
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:32,520
This is Laycock Red Leader.
Hello, Steersman. Am airborne. Over.

1182
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:37,200
Hello, Laycock, Steersman answering.
Vector one-nine-zero buster.

1183
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:41,240
70-plus bandits approaching North Weald.

1184
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,760
It's about time, Woody! Over.

1185
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:47,760
Red Leader,
bandits should be in your area now.

1186
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:53,880
Woody, can't see any planes hereabouts.
Over.

1187
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:57,880
Hello. Bandits should be close to you.
Patrol North Weald.

1188
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,400
That's no good to me.
Turning west, climbing up sun. Over.

1189
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:06,720
I hope you're right, Douglas.
We're sticking our necks out.

1190
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:23,040
Enemy aircraft, 10 o'clock level.

1191
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:27,040
Green Section, take on the top lot.

1192
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:35,400
Go through the middle of 'em!

1193
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,720
Achtung!

1194
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:44,720
(rapid gunfire)

1195
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
- "Six bandits behind us!"
- (rapid gunfire)

1196
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:02,080
(rapid gunfire)

1197
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,840
Watch out!

1198
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,840
(rapid gunfire)

1199
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:25,360
"Six bandits behind us!"

1200
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:34,560
"Look out, he's right on top of you!"

1201
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,560
(rapid gunfire)

1202
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:46,240
"Crow, one's on your tail, break right!"

1203
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:53,640
"I can see him in the mirror."

1204
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:18,920
- Put me down for two. Definite.
- Right.

1205
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:22,920
- What's the score?
- 12 confirmed, several probables.

1206
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,680
- No bombs dropped.
- No casualties.

1207
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:29,680
Here's Leigh-Mallory, skipper.

1208
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:39,200
- Good show, well done.
- Wish we'd had more aircraft, sir.

1209
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:43,680
- One squadron not enough for you?
- With three times the number...

1210
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:48,600
...we'd have shot down three times
as many-we had height, sun.

1211
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:53,400
How would you have handled, say,
three squadrons?

1212
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:57,400
The same as one-get in the best
attack position and then attack.

1213
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:02,680
Once the battle starts,
it's every man for himself and that's that.

1214
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:07,760
I'd rather have started it
with 36 aeroplanes than 12.

1215
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:11,480
I agree with you.
It's a good idea. We'll try it.

1216
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:15,040
Woodhall, arrange that 19 and 310
fly with 242.

1217
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,280
Yessir.
I'll tell the Squadron Commanders.

1218
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:22,280
Bader will lead with 242, of course.
Try to keep him out of trouble.

1219
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:27,440
- Yessir.
- I'll have a word with the boys.

1220
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:43,120
Mr West!
I've collected a few bullet holes...

1221
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,840
...and the cockpit's full of glycol.

1222
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:49,840
- Get it ready in half an hour.
- It'll take two days.

1223
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,920
- No! I said half an hour.
- I can't let it fly, sir.

1224
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:57,960
- All right, get it done as soon as possible.
- You caught a bullet hole yourself.

1225
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:03,040
Near miss. Must be getting careless.

1226
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:07,520
- Hi, Woody.
- Well, how was it, Douglas?

1227
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,520
Not so good. I had to attack on the climb.
We got bounced by the enemy.

1228
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:16,560
- Somebody got you.
- Should see the other fella!

1229
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,080
- Crowley-Milling got him.
- Good.

1230
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,080
If we were up there waiting for 'em,
we could fight on our own terms.

1231
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:28,280
With five squadrons,
I could really start something.

1232
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:32,200
The AOC's coming tomorrow.
Tell him. I'll back you.

1233
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:36,200
Good show. Thanks.

1234
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,200
(Sanderson) Douglas was soon leading...

1235
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:43,240
...a unique formation of five squadrons.

1236
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:46,280
This became known as the Duxford Wing.

1237
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:49,440
His pilots looked on him as a superman...

1238
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:53,440
...and his breezy confidence in the air
reassured young pilots.

1239
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:57,920
(Woody) "Douglas, Vector 190,
orbit North Weald."

1240
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,920
Woody, do me a favour. I'm playing
squash with Peterson in an hour.

1241
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,960
Ring him to say I won't be back till later.

1242
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:08,480
I haven't got time, Douglas.

1243
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,320
Can't you make time?

1244
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:14,320
Just pick up one of those telephones
in front of you.

1245
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:17,640
For the sake of peace and quiet, I will.

1246
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:21,640
"Now, would you mind
getting on with the war?"

1247
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:33,160
(rapid gunfire)

1248
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,080
(Sanderson) By the 12th October...

1249
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:06,840
...Hitler had postponed his invasion
until spring.

1250
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,840
Hitler the invincible
had suffered his first defeat.

1251
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:14,880
The Battle of Britain was over.

1252
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:24,160
Well, Douglas,
the Duxford Wing did splendidly.

1253
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:27,720
- What was it? 150 enemy aircraft?
- 152, sir.

1254
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:31,280
- Oh, thank you, Turner.
- You're welcome, sir.

1255
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,280
- Like to be a Wing Commander?
- I'd like it very much, sir.

1256
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,080
Good.
We want to carry the fight to France.

1257
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:43,080
- We'll build more fighter wings.
- Would I stay here?

1258
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:46,400
- You'd go to Tangmere.
- With my squadron?

1259
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,440
No, you'd have three Spitfire squadrons.

1260
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:52,160
- You can't post our CO, sir!
- Why?

1261
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:53,800
We won't work...

1262
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:57,040
Turner, stop poking the AOC
with your pipe.

1263
01:44:57,040 --> 01:44:58,680
Oh, sorry, sir.

1264
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:02,000
- Let me get you another drink.
- Thank you.

1265
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
If I can't take my squadron with me,
I'm not sure I want to go.

1266
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,800
- You'll do as you're told.
- Very good, sir.

1267
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:17,360
Dougie.

1268
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:19,200
Welcome to Tangmere.

1269
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:22,880
If I'd known you were here,
I'd have thought twice!

1270
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,720
The old man wouldn't let you think once!
Your office.

1271
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,440
- Bags of bumph?
- Floor to ceiling!

1272
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:33,440
Just in case you thought you'd be
flying all day. See you later.

1273
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:38,320
Thanks, Woody.

1274
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:47,160
Hello, hello, what's all this?

1275
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:50,800
Three bus drivers waiting to sign on, sir.

1276
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:53,040
I must want my head examined!

1277
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,080
- (knock at door)
- Come in.

1278
01:45:55,080 --> 01:45:58,760
- Who are you?
- Sgt Williams, sir, orderly room.

1279
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:02,200
- What are these?
- Files for your attention, sir.

1280
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:06,080
I see. Now they've had it.
Anything else?

1281
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,920
- No, sir.
- Good.

1282
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:11,400
- Let's get on with the war.
- What's the gen?

1283
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:15,400
Looks like a sweep over Rouen...

1284
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:20,400
No, I'm sorry,
you must have the wrong number.

1285
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:24,280
- Hello, dear.
- Oh, darling!

1286
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:28,280
You were so late! I've got some coffee
for you. Come and sit down.

1287
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Thank you. I lost three pilots today.
All first-class chaps.

1288
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,800
If only I could... (sighs)

1289
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:37,440
I don't know.

1290
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:41,440
Don't start blaming yourself again.
You can't do any more than you do.

1291
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:46,760
You've done more sweeps
than anyone in Fighter Command.

1292
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:50,240
- This can't go on indefinitely.
- Who says?

1293
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:53,040
The AOC for one. Woody spoke to him.

1294
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:56,760
He thinks you should have
a spell off operations.

1295
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:00,080
Why? I'm fit.
I'd like to finish the season.

1296
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,720
Sounds like a cricket match!
Why can't you rest?

1297
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,760
Because the Wing needs me.

1298
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:09,760
If you're killed,
the Wing'll have to do without you!

1299
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Let's go to Scotland for a fortnight.
We'll tour the golf courses.

1300
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:16,080
No.

1301
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:19,960
They're lovely courses,
the best turf in the world.

1302
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:21,600
By the sea.

1303
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:25,600
You'll find them far more difficult
than the English ones.

1304
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,040
I'll think about it.

1305
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:32,000
No, this time you're going to do
something about it.

1306
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Twice a day I know you're 30,000 feet
over France. You may not all return.

1307
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:40,520
One day, I know it's going to be you.

1308
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:44,520
I'd like a week off. Just a few days
of knowing you'll be home for dinner.

1309
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:49,880
It would help you, too.

1310
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,040
All right, I'll go.

1311
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:54,200
- When, Douglas?
- Next week.

1312
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,840
Promise?

1313
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,080
Yes.

1314
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:59,160
(knocks on wood) Touch wood.

1315
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:03,160
Darling, it's not that I'm selfish.
A dead hero's no good to the Air Force.

1316
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,000
By now, everyone in the Wing
felt Douglas was invulnerable.

1317
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:23,200
It was as if his presence shielded them.

1318
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:27,200
The whole station came to believe
the enemy would never get him.

1319
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Dogsbody calling.
Enemy aircraft 10 o'clock below.

1320
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:51,480
OK, chaps, let's get 'em.

1321
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:00,800
(rapid gunfire)

1322
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,160
(Radio) "Heinkels behind."

1323
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:06,960
(rapid gunfire)

1324
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,960
"One-0-Nines overhead."

1325
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:31,480
(gunfire)

1326
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:35,480
(rapid gunfire)

1327
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:24,920
(explosion)

1328
01:50:56,440 --> 01:51:00,440
You haven't said anything.
What do you really think?

1329
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:06,360
You'll have to face it. We should've
heard something by this time.

1330
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:11,400
I'm sorry... I guess he's had it.

1331
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:15,680
(phone rings)

1332
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:24,680
Hello? Yes?

1333
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:28,240
Yes...

1334
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:32,240
Well, where is...

1335
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,800
Yes... thank you, Woody.

1336
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,560
- Douglas is a prisoner.
- (men cheer)

1337
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:46,800
- You were quite wrong.
- I'm always wrong.

1338
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,440
Where? How?

1339
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:52,440
Woody doesn't know, but the Germans
asked for a leg to be dropped.

1340
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:57,480
- We'll do that.
- No, they'll do it on a bombing raid.

1341
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:15,040
In my heart, I knew they'd never get him.

1342
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:22,680
- Ah, bonjour, Lucille.
- Bonjour, Commandant.

1343
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:26,680
Thank you.

1344
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:43,080
What's that?

1345
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:47,080
A step in the right direction -
all you need now is clothes, a rope...

1346
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:52,400
...and you're in luck.

1347
01:53:03,120 --> 01:53:07,120
- You have everything you want?
- Not exactly, doctor.

1348
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:11,200
I've got my legs,
but I can't walk around in my nightshirt.

1349
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:15,160
- Why not?
- It's embarrassing for the nurses.

1350
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:19,160
- It's regulations.
- Can't you make an exception for me?

1351
01:53:19,480 --> 01:53:22,360
Don't forget I'm invited to tea
at the aerodrome.

1352
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:26,360
I suppose it is all right. I'll have
your clothes brought back to you.

1353
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:31,680
- Thank you, very decent of you.
- Lucille, vous venez avec nous.

1354
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:45,800
Now all we need is a rope.

1355
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:49,800
(clock chimes)

1356
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,440
(whimpers)

1357
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:02,440
(clock chimes)

1358
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,600
- Got enough sheets?
- Got the lot.

1359
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:13,600
Feel spiteful taking that boy's,
but what else can I do?

1360
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:17,840
- I'll tell him when he wakes up.
- All right, but don't forget.

1361
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:28,200
(boy whimpers in his sleep)

1362
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:31,440
(boy cries out)

1363
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:35,400
If they hear him, I'm sunk.
They'll send a nurse in.

1364
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:39,400
(whimpers)

1365
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:48,920
(footsteps approaching)

1366
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:04,120
Hope it takes the weight.

1367
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:08,120
If you're left hanging, you won't be able
to climb back up or drop down.

1368
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
That's a chance I'll have to take.

1369
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:21,960
Here goes.

1370
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:31,160
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1371
01:55:43,400 --> 01:55:46,000
What about the curfew?

1372
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
...the curfew!

1373
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:35,200
- Monsieur De Glacerer?
- Oui.

1374
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,200
Vite, va ici.

1375
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:41,200
It will not be easy. We must walk 3km.
Will you be all right?

1376
01:56:41,840 --> 01:56:45,840
I'll manage. Let's go.

1377
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:52,480
(distant marching)

1378
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:10,680
(marching recedes)

1379
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,320
- All right?
- Yes.

1380
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:16,320
Be careful. It is a long way
and there is a curfew.

1381
01:57:56,120 --> 01:58:00,120
I've had it, old boy.
Can you give me a minute or two?

1382
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:04,200
- But it is only the next house.
- I know, Gilbert.

1383
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:06,240
Attention! Boche!

1384
01:58:06,240 --> 01:58:10,240
Now take my right arm.

1385
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:18,320
On my back, monsieur.

1386
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:34,440
Entrez vite!

1387
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:38,160
- Merci, madame.
- (Gilbert) Ses jambes ont mal.

1388
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:42,160
Venez-vous asseoir ici-dans ce fauteuil.

1389
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:48,160
Gilbert, il faut partir.

1390
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:54,280
- You are refreshed, monsieur?
- Yes.

1391
01:58:54,280 --> 01:58:57,240
Thank you for the ointment for my legs.

1392
01:58:57,240 --> 01:59:01,240
I'll be glad when it's dark.
If they find me, you're liable to be shot.

1393
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:04,680
They will not find you.

1394
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:08,680
Tonight my son-in-law
will take you to some more friends.

1395
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:13,000
- Now, drink your coffee.
- Merci, madame.

1396
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,640
- Boches!
- Mets-le sous la paille!

1397
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:19,640
Venez!

1398
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,920
Vite, monsieur.

1399
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:32,960
(shouting outside)

1400
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,120
- Here?
- Oui, oui, oui, oui!

1401
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:37,040
Oui, comme ça.

1402
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:38,480
Bon.

1403
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:42,480
(shouting outside)

1404
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:51,360
Bonne chance, monsieur!

1405
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:08,480
Seh' dir das mal hier an!

1406
02:00:17,560 --> 02:00:18,840
All right!

1407
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:20,880
Hold it, hold it.

1408
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:24,760
- Lhr müßt anständig geguckt haben.
- Wir haben alles durchsucht.

1409
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:28,000
- You win.
- Wing Commander, we caught you.

1410
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,840
You speak English well.

1411
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,840
I lived in London, Streatham, for 11 years.

1412
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:39,640
- The people didn't know I was here.
- So I understand. After you.

1413
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,600
Where to? Back to hospital?

1414
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:46,600
No, first to headquarters in St Emer.
From there we'll go to Germany.

1415
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:59,720
Die beiden auch.

1416
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:25,720
- They had nothing to do with it!
- It's just routine questioning.

1417
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:38,560
We will take your legs away
until you are in the camp in Germany.

1418
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,560
You will not escape again.

1419
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:46,560
(Sanderson) In fact, he escaped twice more
during the next eight months.

1420
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,120
It was the old story.

1421
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:53,120
If there was a battle to be fought,
Douglas was going to fight it.

1422
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:59,120
Herr Wing Commander, you are leaving
the camp. You will go tomorrow.

1423
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:02,320
Again? Where to this time?

1424
02:02:02,320 --> 02:02:05,600
We're taking you somewhere
more comfortable.

1425
02:02:05,600 --> 02:02:09,600
I'd rather live in a pigsty with friends
than a palace by myself.

1426
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:13,960
- I won't go.
- The Kommandant says you must.

1427
02:02:13,960 --> 02:02:17,960
- Take me to him.
- He'll see you when you move out.

1428
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:22,120
He won't. Not unless he drags me out.
I'm staying here.

1429
02:02:22,120 --> 02:02:26,120
Gewehre in Anschlag!

1430
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:35,280
I'm staying here.

1431
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:38,040
- Nicht doch.
- Ruht!

1432
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:42,000
Stand to attention
when you address a German officer!

1433
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,200
I don't need a lesson in manners!
Shut up!

1434
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:49,080
- Muß man sich das gefallen lassen...
- Wir besprechen das morgen.

1435
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:53,080
You leave tomorrow.

1436
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,440
Kolonne, halt!

1437
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:08,440
Pity Sanderson isn't here. He'd have
enjoyed this-like the old days.

1438
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:17,960
Wing Commander Bader, I have instructions
to transfer you to another camp.

1439
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:21,520
- No.
- You still refuse to go?

1440
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:24,600
- That's right.
- Then we must use force.

1441
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:27,000
You can always try.

1442
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,040
Wing Commander Day...

1443
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:33,040
...as senior British officer,
please persuade Bader to obey our orders.

1444
02:03:34,920 --> 02:03:38,160
You may have three minutes.

1445
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:40,320
They're within their rights.

1446
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:42,360
Ah, to blazes with 'em!

1447
02:03:42,360 --> 02:03:46,360
You've given 'em a lot of headaches.
We're on your side.

1448
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:50,160
But it only needs a spark
to start an incident.

1449
02:03:50,160 --> 02:03:54,160
This place is too crowded
to have bullets flying around.

1450
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:04,160
All right, Harry, you win.

1451
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:07,120
- Goodbye, Douglas.
- Goodbye, old boy.

1452
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:11,120
They'll send for my kit.
See to it for me, will you?

1453
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:33,960
- Good old Douglas!
- (laughter)

1454
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:38,920
He's inspecting the bastards!

1455
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:42,920
(roar of laughter)

1456
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:46,960
Schluß mit dem!

1457
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:51,640
(cheering)

1458
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:59,600
(Sanderson) Douglas was moved
from camp to camp...

1459
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:03,400
...until inevitably
he ended up at Colditz Castle.

1460
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:07,400
It was here that he finished
his fours years of captivity...

1461
02:05:07,640 --> 02:05:10,040
...on a spring morning in 1945.

1462
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:14,040
(cheering)

1463
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:19,760
Hey, they've arrived! The Yanks are here!

1464
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:31,400
We're glad to see you, Colonel.

1465
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:35,400
Any Spitfires in the area?
I'd like to fly before it's all over.

1466
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:40,280
- The British squadrons are up north.
- Oh, thanks. See you in a moment.

1467
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,760
Haven't they had enough? Why don't
they forget about it and go home?

1468
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:15,080
Darling, why didn't you tell me
you were coming?!

1469
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:19,080
I came as soon as possible.
I thought it'd be a bit of a surprise.

1470
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:22,160
A bit of a surprise?!

1471
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:24,640
Oh, darling, you look wonderful!

1472
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:28,040
Funny, I was going to say
the same about you!

1473
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:30,880
(Both) I...

1474
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:34,880
I can't think of anything to say
and there's so much.

1475
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:37,520
I know.

1476
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,840
It'll all come back gradually.

1477
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:43,840
Yes, there's plenty of time now,
all the time in the world.

1478
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:46,560
Well, the war isn't over yet.

1479
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:50,000
It is for you, my darling.

1480
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,640
Douglas, please!

1481
02:06:51,640 --> 02:06:54,960
Look, we'll talk about that later, shall we?

1482
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,200
God, haven't you had enough?!

1483
02:06:57,200 --> 02:07:01,200
I'm still in the Air Force.
The war's still on in the Far East.

1484
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I want just one last fling
before it's all over.

1485
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:09,880
Thelma...

1486
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:11,960
...do you know something...

1487
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:15,960
...I'd forgotten
what a very pretty girl you are.

1488
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:29,200
I suppose it won't
make any difference what I say.

1489
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:31,840
You'll still have your last fling.

1490
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:35,840
(cheering)

1491
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:39,120
And so Douglas never had his last fling.

1492
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:41,480
But on September 15th, 1945...

1493
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:45,280
...the fifth anniversary of the greatest day
in the Battle of Britain...

1494
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:48,520
...300 aircraft were to pass
in triumphant procession.

1495
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:50,120
In the forefront...

1496
02:07:50,120 --> 02:07:52,040
...12 survivors of the Battle...

1497
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:55,600
...a few of the few
flying again over London...

1498
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:57,880
...the city they had defended.

1499
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:01,440
Their leader was
Group Captain Douglas Bader.

1500
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:03,280
- Sir.
- Hello, Bader.

1501
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:07,280
Wing Commander Crowley-Milling, sir.
Group Captain Turner.

1502
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:11,680
How do you do, sir?

1503
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:15,720
Well, Johnny, I wish you were with us.

1504
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:19,440
We might be tempted to beat up
Buckingham Palace!

1505
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,760
- Will you wait here?
- Course.

1506
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:25,720
- Quite a moment, isn't it?
- Yes. Time we were off.

1507
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:29,720
Don't get into any fights this time.
Good luck, darling.

1508
02:08:31,160 --> 02:08:35,160
I'll be back in an hour.

1509
02:08:38,040 --> 02:08:41,120
- Time to start up, sir.
- See you later.

1510
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:44,920
Thank you, sir.

1511
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:48,920
Let's go.

1512
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:09,600
This is a story of courage.

1513
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:12,920
It has no end
because courage has no end.

1514
02:09:12,920 --> 02:09:16,560
It is the story of a man
made famous by war...

1515
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:20,560
...yet for whom the war was only
an episode in a greater victory...

1516
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:25,440
...fought for and won in silence and pain.

1517
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:28,880
The victory of a man's own spirit...

1518
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:32,880
...creating strength and hope
out of disaster.

1519
