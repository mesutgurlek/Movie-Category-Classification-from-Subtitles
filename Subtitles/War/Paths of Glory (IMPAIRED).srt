00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:41,851
[Man Narrating] War began between
Germany and France on August 3, 1914.

3
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,771
Five weeks later,
the German army had smashed its way...

4
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:47,106
to within 18 miles of Paris.

5
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,444
There, the battered French miraculously
rallied their forces at the Marne River...

6
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,780
- and in a series of unexpected counterattacks.
- [Officer] Detail, halt!

7
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,948
- Drove the Germans back.
- [Shouting Commands]

8
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,742
The front was stabilized...

9
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,369
then shortly afterwards developed
into a continuous line...

10
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,371
of heavily fortified trenches...

11
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,707
zigzagging their way 500 miles...

12
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,460
from the English Channel
to the Swiss frontier.

13
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,465
By 1916, after two grisly years
of trench warfare...

14
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,759
the battle lines had changed very little.

15
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,138
Successful attacks were measured
in hundreds of yards...

16
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,266
and paid for in lives
by hundreds of thousands.

17
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,063
General Broulard, sir.

18
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,607
- [Laughing]
- Hello, George. How are you?

19
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,360
Paul, wonderful seeing you again.
Really wonderful.

20
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:35,905
Well, this is splendid. It's superb.

21
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,157
It's grand, very grand.

22
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,952
Well, I've tried to create
a pleasant atmosphere in which to work.

23
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,704
Well, you've succeeded marvelously.
I wish I had your taste in carpets.

24
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,456
- Oh! [Laughing]
- And pictures.

25
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,500
You're much too kind, George.
Much too kind.

26
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,502
- Sit down, George.
- Thank you.

27
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:54,090
I really haven't done very much. The place
is much the same as it was when I moved in.

28
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,886
Paul, I've come to see you
about something big.

29
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:02,181
It's top secret and must go no further
than your chief of staff...

30
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,517
and not to him
unless you can trust his discretion.

31
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,935
Of course.

32
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,564
A group of armies is forming on this front
for an offensive very soon.

33
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,858
Headquarters is determined
to make a complete breakthrough.

34
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,360
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm really sorry.

35
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,822
I thought for just a moment I knew
what you were going to say. Please go on.

36
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,868
I never knew you were a mind reader.
What did you think I was about to say?

37
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,579
- Something about the "Anthill."
- You are a mind reader.

38
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,332
Well, it is a key position.
It's in my sector.

39
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:30,501
To be perfectly honest,
I've heard some talk.

40
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,920
You know, there's nothing really secret
around headquarters.

41
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,176
Well, what do you think?

42
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:36,924
It's the key to the whole
German position in this sector.

43
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,010
They've held on to it for a year now...

44
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,804
and it looks as though they'll hold on to it
for another year if they want to.

45
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,265
Paul, I have formal orders
to take the Anthill no later than the 10th.

46
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,546
That's the day after tomorrow.

47
00:03:45,547 --> 00:03:47,977
That comes pretty close to
being ridiculous, don't you think?

48
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:51,647
I don't imagine I'd be here
if I really thought that.

49
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:56,235
[Chuckles] Paul, if there’s one man in this army
who can do this for me, it's you.

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,239
It's out of the question, George.
Absolutely out of the question.

51
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,408
My division was cut to pieces.

52
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,037
What's left of it is in no position
to even hold the Anthill, let alone take it.

53
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,122
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

54
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,627
Well, Paul, there was something else
I wanted to tell you.

55
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,463
However, I'm sure that you'll misunderstand
my motives in mentioning it.

56
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,049
- What was it?
- Oh.

57
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,343
You'd be bound to misunderstand.

58
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,971
However, as your friend,
maybe I should tell you.

59
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,348
What are you trying to say, George?

60
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:30,436
Paul, talk around headquarters is that you
are being considered for the 12th Corps.

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,230
- The 12th Corps?
- Yes, and with that, another star.

62
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,232
Now, I've pushed it all I can.

63
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,611
The 12th Corps needs a fighting general,
and you're overdue on that star.

64
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,905
Now, we both know
that your record is good enough...

65
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,783
for you to refuse this assignment
on the grounds you've stated.

66
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,785
No one would question your opinion.

67
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,329
They'd simply get someone else
to do the job.

68
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:52,041
So you shouldn't let this
influence your opinion, Paul.

69
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,046
- Oh, I'm sorry. Have a cognac?
- No, thanks, Paul, not before dinner.

70
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,887
George, I'm responsible
for the lives of8,000 men.

71
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,933
What is my ambition against that?

72
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,353
What is my reputation
in comparison to that?

73
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,564
My men come first of all, George,
and those men know it too.

74
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,483
I know that they do.

75
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,653
You see, George, those men know
that I would never let them down.

76
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,405
That goes without saying.

77
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,699
The life of one of those soldiers
means more to me...

78
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,035
than all the stars and decorations
and honors in France.

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,454
So...

80
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,333
you think this attack is absolutely beyond
the ability of your men at this time?

81
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,585
I didn't say that, George.

82
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,090
Nothing is beyond those men,
once their fighting spirit is aroused.

83
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,176
Paul, I don't want to push you into it
if you think it's ill-advised.

84
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,471
Don't worry, George.
You couldn't do that if you tried.

85
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,475
Of course, artillery would make
an enormous difference.

86
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,396
- What artillery support can you give me?
- Well, I'll see.

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,148
What about replacements?

88
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:01,152
We'll see what we can do, but I feel sure
that you can get along with what you have.

89
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,779
- Might just do it.
- [Chuckling] Oh, Paul.

90
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,700
I knew that I was right to come to you.
You are the man to take the Anthill.

91
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,078
- Now, as far as that star is concerned.
- That had nothing to do with my decision.

92
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:14,915
- If anything, it would sway me the other way.
- I realize that perfectly, Paul.

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,001
Now, when do you say
you see this coming off?

94
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,378
No later than the day after tomorrow.

95
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,130
We just might do it.

Ready to kill more Germans?

- No, sir.

- Well, I'll bet your mother's proud of you.
- Yes, sir.

- Well, carry on, Private, and good luck to you.

- Yes, sir.
- Aha! Working over your rifle, I see.

106
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,725
Well, that's the way.
It's a soldier's best friend.

107
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,228
You be good to it,
and it'll always be good to you.

108
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,230
Yes, sir.

[Chuckles]
Well, uh, good luck to you, soldier.

Well, is everything all right, soldier?

00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,274
All right? Yes, sir, I'm all right.

Aha. Good fellow.
Are you married, soldier?

- Married? Me, married?
- [Machine Gun Fire]

- Yes. Have you got a wife?
- A wife? Have I got a wife?

Sir, he's a bit shell-shocked.

120
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,832
I beg your pardon, Sergeant.
There is no such thing as shell shock.

121
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,378
- Have you got a wife, soldier?
- My wife?

122
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,339
My wife. Yes, I have a wife.

123
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,092
I'm never gonna see her again.
I'm gonna be killed.

Get a grip on yourself!
You're acting like a coward!

- I am a coward, sir.
- Snap out of it, soldier!

126
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,601
Sergeant, I want you to arrange for the immediate
transfer of this baby out of my regiment!

127
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,270
I won't have other brave men
contaminated by him!

128
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,772
- Yes, sir.
- Carry on, Sergeant.

129
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,155
You were right, sir. This sort of thing
can spread if it isn't checked.

130
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,365
You know, General,
I'm convinced that these tours of yours...

131
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,035
have an incalculable effect
upon the morale of these men.

132
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,913
In fact, I think the fighting spirit
of the 701st derives from it.

133
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,081
No, no, Major.
That spirit was just born in them.

It's our privilege entirely.

- Well, quite a neat little spot you have here.
- Colonel.

I reserve comment on the neatness, sir,
but it is little.

142
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,411
Pretty shy on seating accommodations though.

143

More than enough for me.
I never got the habit of sitting.

I can vouch for that, Colonel.

00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,974
waving papers at the enemy...

151
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,143
worrying about whether a mouse
is going to run up their pants leg.

152
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,105
I don't know, General. If I had the choice
between mice and Mausers...

153
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,107
I think I'd take the mice every time.

154
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,109
You'll never make me believe that, Colonel.

155
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,653
Seriously though, if a man's a ninny...

156
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,114
let him put on a dress
and hide under the bed.

157
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:18,325
But if he wants to be a soldier,
then, by heavens, he's got to be one.

158
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,495
He's got to fight, and he can't do that
unless he's where the fighting is.

159
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,622
That's my credo.

160
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,959
I think I have to agree with you,
presenting your case so convincingly, sir.

161
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,253
[Major] And you've never failed
to live up to it, sir.

162
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,630
- I imagine you'd like a look around, wouldn't you?
- Yes, Colonel.

163
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,216
- [Machine Gun Fire]
- Well, here's something to see.

164
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,594
The Anthill. About as good a view
as you can get without actually being there.

165
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,972
[Laughs]
Well, that won't be long now, will it?

166
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,974
[Laughing]

167
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,728
- [Machine Gun Fire In Distance]
- Ah.

168
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,730
Ah. Yeah.

169
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,359
Well, I've seen
much more formidable objectives.

170
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,403
Much, much worse.

171
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:03,370
Well, not something we can grab
and run away with...

172
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,664
but certainly pregnable.

173
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:08,500
- Sounds kind of odd, though, doesn't it?
- Why?

174
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,003
Well, like something to do
with giving birth.

175
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,048
[Chuckling] Oh, yes. Quite. You're right
on your toes this morning, Colonel.

176
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,008
Even sharper than usual.

177
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,054
But we mustn't forget, the colonel was perhaps
the foremost criminal lawyer in all France.

178
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,098
- Of course, General.
- Gentlemen, you're both much too kind.

179
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,436
Tell me, Colonel, how did your relief
come off last night?

180
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,522
We drew some artillery.
Twenty-nine casualties, sir.

181
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,524
Yes, I noticed it on the road in.

182
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,651
Utterly inexcusable. Stupid.

183
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,696
All swarmed together like a bunch of flies,
just waiting for someone to swat 'em.

184
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,698
[Chuckles]
Well, they never learn, it seems.

185
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,327
They get in a tight spot under heavy fire,
gang up every time.

186
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,080
Herd instinct, I suppose.
Kind of a lower-animal sort of thing.

187
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,374
Kind of a human sort of thing,
it seems to me...

188
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,501
or don't you make a distinction
between the two, Major?

189
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,046
Oh, yes, uh, very regrettable, of course.
Very. Yes, indeed.

190
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,591
Uh, Major, would you be kind enough
to excuse us for a few minutes?

191
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,676
Yes, sir. Of course.

192
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,846
Colonel.

193
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,809
- [Bullets Whistling]
- [Machine Gun Fire Continues]

194
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,478
Well, Colonel, what do you think of it?

195
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,439
- What do I think of what, sir?
- The Anthill.

196
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,818
Colonel, your regiment
is going to take the Anthill tomorrow.

197
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,238
You know the condition of my men, sir.

198
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,699
Oh, naturally, men are going to have to
be killed. Possibly a lot of them.

199
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,785
They absorb bullets and shrapnel...

200
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,329
and by doing so make it possible
for others to get through.

201
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,040
- What support will we have?
- I have none to give you.

202
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,420
What sort of casualties
do you anticipate, sir?

203
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,256
Hmm, say, five percent killed
by our own barrage.

204
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,258
That's a very generous allowance.

205
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,677
Ten percent more
in getting through no-man's-land...

206
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,971
and 20% more getting through the wire.

207
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:47,891
That leaves 65%
with the worst part of the job over.

208
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,979
Let's say another 25%
in actually taking the Anthill.

209
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,149
We're still left with a force
more than adequate to hold it.

210
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,068
General, you're saying that more
than half of my men will be killed.

211
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,113
Yes, it's a terrible price to pay, Colonel...

212
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,866
but we will have the Anthill.

213
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,119
- But will we, sir?
- I'm depending on you, Colonel.

214
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,204
All France is depending on you.

215
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,085
Am I amusing you, Colonel?

216
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,882
I'm not a bull, General. I don't need a flag
waved in front of me to get me to charge.

217
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,051
I don't think I like your comparison
of the flag of France to a bullfighter's cape.

218
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,137
I meant nothing disrespectful
to the flag of France, sir.

219
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,333
Patriotism may be old-fashioned,

220
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:28,348
but show me a patriot, and
I'll show you an honest man.

221
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,100
Not everyone has always thought so.

222
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,644
Samuel Johnson had something else
to say about patriotism.

223
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,647
And what was that, may I ask?

224
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,900
- Nothing really.
- What you do mean, "Nothing really"?

225
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,735
Well, sir, nothing really important.

226
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,820
Colonel, when I ask a question,
it's always important.

227
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,031
- Now, who was this man?
- Samuel Johnson, sir.

228
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,742
All right. Now, what did he
have to say about patriotism?

229
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,161
He said it was the last refuge
of a scoundrel, sir.

230
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,246
I'm sorry. I meant nothing personal.

231
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,501
You're tired, Dax. You're very tired.

232
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,961
It's you who are exhausted, not your men.

233
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,381
And it's my fault. I've given you
one impossible task after another.

234
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,510
- You need rest. You need it badly.
- I haven't said anything about needing rest, sir.

235
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,554
And you never would either. Therefore, you're
not going to have any say-so about it, Colonel.

236
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,140
As from right now,
I'm ordering you on indefinite furlough.

237
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,876
General, you can't take
me away from my men.

238
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:12,976
You can't do that to me, sir.

239
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,688
Not to you, Dax. For you.
For your good and for the good of your men.

240
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,732
The good of my men, sir?

241
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:22,361
If a commanding officer lacks confidence,
what can we expect of his men?

242
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,657
Naturally, I don't want to relieve you,
but I must have your enthusiastic support.

243
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,952
Not once have you said
that your men can take the Anthill.

244
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,623
We'll take the Anthill.

245
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,378
If any soldiers in the world can take it...

246
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,713
we'll take the Anthill.

247
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,300
And when you do, your men will
be relieved and get a long rest.

- You took your time about it.
- We prepared as quick as we could, sir.

250
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,575
We had to alert the sentries.

251
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,577
All right. You men, at ease.

There will only be the three of us,
and we're to avoid a fight if we can.

[Clears Throat]

256
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:27,009
We go out to the left, and we come back
through Post 6 on the right.

257
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,803
- Is everything all clear at Post 6?
- All the sentries have been warned up to here.

258
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,307
Number 6 will send up flares
at 10-minute intervals starting at 0400.

259
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,184
- I wanted them every five minutes.
- I told them that, sir.

260
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,145
The sergeant says every
five minutes is too much.

261
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,646
He says it's certain to draw artillery.

262
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,773
Quite a strategist, this sergeant.
What's his name?

I don't know, sir.

I'll join you in a minute.

- It smelled like heaven.

I can always tell when he's had a few.
He gets sarcastic.

269
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,887
Well, at least he could have
passed it around, the pig.

Hey, what's he got against you anyway?

Yes, I am. Happily surprised.
I thought you'd been killed.

What are you talking about?

298
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,313
I don't think I like your tone.

299
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,691
You're speaking to an officer.
Remember that.

300
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,152
[Chuckling]
Oh, well, I must be mistaken then, sir.

301
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,655
An officer wouldn't do that.

302
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,241
A man wouldn't do it.

303
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,368
Only a thing would.

304
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,955
- A sneaky, booze-guzzling, yellow-bellied rat.
- Now.

305
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,250
with a bottle for a brain and a streak of spit
where his spine ought to be.

306
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,294
- That's enough, Corporal!
- You've got yourself into a mess, Lieutenant.

307
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,589
Oh, I have, have I?
Well, you've got yourself in a worse one.

308
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:26,428
First, general insubordination.
Second, threatening your superior officer.

309
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:30,682
Third, refusing to obey an order
and inciting others to do the same.

310
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,393
Now, how do you think those charges
are gonna look on paper?

311
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,729
Not half as bad as these.

312
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:38,773
Endangering the lives of your men
through recklessness.

313
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,525
Drunk on duty.

314
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,902
Wanton murder of one of your own men...

315
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,655
and cowardice in the face of the enemy.

316
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:52,537
Philippe, have you ever tried to bring
charges against an officer?

317
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,331
It's my word against yours, you know.

318
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,542
And whose word do you think
they're gonna believe?

319
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,627
Or l-let me put it another way.

320
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,589
Whose word do you think
they're going to accept?

321
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:05,175
Now, I'll tell you what I'm willing to do.

322
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:08,219
So far, all I have written in this report...

323
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,639
is that you and Lejeune
were killed while out on patrol.

324
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:13,933
I'll fix this to read
that you made your way back...

325
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,894
after becoming separated
during the skirmish.

326
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,230
- That'll end the matter once and for all.
- You killed Lejeune. You know that, don't you?

327
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,733
- I'm sorry. It was an accident.
- You threw that grenade and killed him.

328
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,903
I'd give anything in the world if it hadn't
have happened, and that's the truth.

329
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,656
Honestly, I know you don't like me,
but what kind of a man do you think I am?

330
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,244
- Oh, good morning, Colonel.
- At ease, men.

331
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,330
I've been waiting for your report,
Lieutenant.

332
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,499
Well, I think we found out
a thing or two.

333
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:41,086
- Everything go well?
- No, sir. Private Lejeune was killed.

334
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,421
- How'd it happen?
- It's all right here in the report, sir.

335
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:46,591
- Well, let's have it.
- Oh, it isn't quite finished yet, sir.

336
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,927
That's all, Corporal.
You did a good night's work.

337
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,472
Should feel very proud of yourself.
Go get some sleep.

338
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,516
Yes, sir.

339
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,314
- How'd you lose Lejeune?
- Machine gun fire, sir.

340
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,067
He coughed.
Almost got us all killed.

341
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,737
Finish that report
and get it to my dugout immediately.

342
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,739
Yes, sir.

343
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,872
The artillery starts at 0515.

344
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:22,085
First Battalion will move out at 0530.

345
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,420
When the leading elements
have cleared the German wires...

346
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,215
the second wave, consisting of
the Second and Third Battalions.

347
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,969
minus two companies in reserve.
will move out...

348
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,471
in no case later than 0540.

349
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:37,642
Well, that's it, gentlemen.
Are there any questions?

350
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,021
Sir, is 15 minutes of artillery preparation
all that we can expect?

351
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:46,609
The feeling is that any more than that will
give them too much time to get organized.

352
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,903
What's weather supposed to be like
tomorrow, sir?

353
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:52,031
Too good.

354
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,867
No chance of rain or fog?

355
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:57,579
The forecast is for sun all day.

356
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:02,083
[Officer] lf, uh. Perhaps I should say
when we take the Anthill...

357
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:05,086
how long do we have to hold it
before we can expect any support?

358
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:09,549
Well, General Mireau, who, by the way,
will be personally observing the attack...

359
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,594
has promised us support from the 72nd
by sundown tomorrow...

360
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:16,181
which means, of course,
that we'll have to hold all day.

361
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,309
Are there any more questions?

362
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:27,025
Well, gentlemen, good luck, and I'm sure
you'll come through as you always do.

363
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,068
Let's get some sleep.

364
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,073
[Man Whispering] I'm not afraid
of dying tomorrow, only of getting killed.

365
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,825
That's as clear as mud.

366
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,953
Which would you rather be done in by,
a bayonet or a machine gun?

367
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,664
- Oh, a machine gun, naturally.
- Naturally. That’s just my point.

368
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,875
They're both pieces of steel
ripping into your guts.

369
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,794
Only the machine gun is quicker,
cleaner and less painful, isn't it?

370
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,213
What does that prove?

371
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,424
That proves that most of us are more afraid
of getting hurt than of getting killed.

372
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,176
Look at Bernard.

373
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,304
He panics when it comes to gas,
but gas doesn't bother me a bit.

374
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,724
He's seen photos of gas cases.
Doesn't mean anything to me.

375
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,228
But I'll tell you something though. I'd hate
like the devil to be without my tin hat.

376
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,189
But on the other hand, I don't mind
not having a tin hat for my tail.

377
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,233
- Why's that?
- You ought to. That's where your brains are.

378
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,194
Because I know a wound to the head
will hurt much more than one in the tail.

379
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,988
The tail is just meat,
but the head. ah, the head is all bone.

380
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,449
- Ah, speak for yourself.
- Tell me this.

381
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,035
Aside from the bayonet,
what are you most afraid of?

382
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,329
- High explosives.
- Exactly! And it's the same with me.

383
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,415
Because. Because I know that it can
chew you up worse than anything else.

384
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,459
Look, it’s just like I'm trying to tell you.

385
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,045
If you're really afraid of dying, you'd be
living in a funk all the rest of your life...

386
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,506
because you know you've got
to go someday, any day.

387
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,008
And besides, if it's death
that you're really afraid of...

388
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,302
why should you care about
what it is that kills you?

389
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:40,682
Ah, you're too smart for me, Professor.
All I know is nobody wants to die.

00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,998
- General Mireau speaking!
- Battery commander speaking, sir.

448
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,501
The troops are mutinying,
refusing to advance.

449
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,545
Fire as ordered until further notice!

450
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,382
With all respect, sir, you have no right
to order me to shoot down my own men...

451
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:15,052
unless you are willing to take full
and undivided responsibility for it.

452
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,596
Captain Rousseau,
are you going to obey my order?

453
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,225
I must have a written order
before I can execute such a command, sir.

454
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,728
Supposing you're killed.
Then where will I be?

455
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,148
You'll be in front of a firing squad
tomorrow morning! That's where you'll be!

456
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:31,861
Hand over your command and report yourself
under arrest to my headquarters!

457
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,832
Roget!

458
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,835
Lieutenant Roget!
Why are your men still in here?

459
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,045
It was impossible, sir.
Major Vignon is dead.

460
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,299
Get these men out of the trenches!
Come on!

461
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:57,094
Let's get ready for another try!
Get these men out of here!

462
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,180
I've tried three times.
Look at all the casualties.

463
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,807
All right! Let's give it another try!

464
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,602
Come on! Let's give it another try!

465
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,521
[Whistle Blows]

466
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,692
[Machine Gun Fire]

467
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:18,616
It's impossible, sir.
All the men are falling back.

468
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:24,497
Sir, I respectfully submit to the colonel.

469
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:29,376
Pardon, your remarks to me
were very unfair, sir.

470
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:33,047
It’s just impossible! It’s just impossible.

471
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,884
General, according to first reports,
the attack has failed all along the line.

472
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,428
The men are falling back to our own trenches.

473
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:44,308
Major Saint-Auban, arrange for
the immediate relief of the 701st Regiment.

474
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,312
Have them sent to the Château d'Aigle.
Have Colonel Dax report to my headquarters.

475
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,357
- Yes, sir.
- Major Couderc, assemble a general court-martial.

476
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:54,068
Have it ready to meet
at 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

477
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:58,239
If those little sweethearts won't face
German bullets, they'll face French ones!

478
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:10,960
I ordered an attack.

479
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,003
Your troops refused to attack.

480
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,506
Our troops did attack, sir,
but they could make no headway.

481
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,050
Because they didn't try, Colonel.
I saw it myself.

482
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,135
Half of your men never left the trenches.

483
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,097
A third of my men were pinned down
because the fire was so intense.

484
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,432
Don't quibble over fractions, Colonel.

485
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,562
The fact remains that a good part of your men
never left their own trenches.

486
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:33,482
Colonel Dax, I'm going to have 10 men
from each company in your regiment...

487
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,527
tried under penalty of death for cowardice.

488
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,946
- Penalty of death?
- For cowardice!

489
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,240
They have skimmed milk in their veins
instead of blood.

490
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,697
Then it's the reddest
milk I've ever seen.

491
00:36:42,698 --> 00:36:44,326
My trenches are soaked
with that red skimmed milk.

492
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,454
- That’s just about enough out of you, Colonel!
- I'm not gonna mince words and stand on protocol.

493
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,416
Colonel Dax, if you continue in this manner,
I shall have to place you under arrest.

494
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,502
I believe the colonel has a point,
even though he makes it rather bluntly.

495
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:56,463
This is not a trial,
but it does bear certain aspects of one.

496
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:59,925
And Colonel Dax, technically,
is cast in the role of the defense.

497
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,760
In view of the gravity of the charges...

498
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,680
a court of law would grant him
all possible latitude in presenting his case.

499
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,058
Latitude is one thing.
Insubordination another.

500
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:12,354
I am merely offering an opinion, General.
Please do not feel constrained to accept it.

501
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:16,275
I am perfectly willing to accept it,
General Broulard.

502
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,904
I'm sorry, sir.
I certainly didn't intend to be insubordinate.

503
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:23,115
My only aim is to remind you
of the heroism these men have shown...

504
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,242
on every occasion in the past.

505
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:28,245
We're not talking about the past.
We're talking about the present.

506
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,414
But don't you see, sir?
They're not cowards.

507
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,043
So if some of them didn't leave the trenches,
it must have been because it was impossible.

508
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:38,339
They were ordered to attack.
It was their duty to obey that order.

509
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,634
We can't leave it up to the men
to decide when an order is possible or not.

510
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,595
If it was impossible,
the only proof of that...

511
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:48,182
would be their dead bodies
lying at the bottom of the trenches.

512
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,434
They're scum, Colonel.

513
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,478
The whole rotten regiment.

514
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,230
a pack of sneaking, whining,
tail-dragging curs.

515
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:59,985
- Do you really believe that, sir?
- Yes, I do. That's exactly what I believe.

516
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,947
And what's more,
it's an incontestable fact.

517
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,491
- Then why not shoot the entire regiment?
- [Laughing]

518
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,953
- I'm perfectly serious.
- Now, Colonel, you're missing the point entirely.

519
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,665
We don't want to slaughter the French army.
All we want to do is to set an example.

520
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,209
Oh, well, if it's an example you want,
then take me.

521
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,711
- Take you?
- Yes, sir, if it's an example you want...

522
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,713
one man will do as well as a hundred.

523
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:24,051
The logical choice is the officer
most responsible for the attack.

524
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,179
[Broulard] Come now, Colonel.
I think you’re overwrought.

525
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,890
This is not a question of officers.

526
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:33,060
Paul, we don't want to overdo this thing.

527
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,770
Suppose we just make it a dozen.

528
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,941
[Exhales] I was talking of a hundred men,
and now we're down to 12.

529
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,402
Paul, let's not haggle over this thing anymore!

530
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,571
Let's get it settled once and for all
so that we can all live with it.

531
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:51,578
Well, perhaps I was a bit too anxious
to see proper justice meted out.

532
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,872
I've spent my entire life in the army.

533
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,291
I've always tried to be true to my principles.

534
00:38:56,376 --> 00:39:00,170
That's the only mistake
I can ever be accused of.

535
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,423
I'll settle for this.

536
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,176
have the company commanders select one man
from each company in the first wave...

537
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,178
three in all.

538
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,222
Well, that's very reasonable of you, Paul.

539
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,642
The court-martial will meet
at the château at 3:00 this afternoon.

540
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:16,812
- Will that be convenient for you, General?
- I won't be there, Paul.

541
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,272
You won't be there?

542
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,774
No, I think it best
that you handle this matter on your own.

543
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,528
- Probably so.
- General Mireau.

544
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,657
If it's at all possible, I'd like
to be appointed counsel for the accused.

545
00:39:28,742 --> 00:39:30,701
I'll take the matter into consideration.

546
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,786
I think we can permit that, can't we, Paul?
Of course we can.

547
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,580
- Consider it settled, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

548
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:38,751
Well, noon straight up, Paul.

549
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,753
I hope that you can stay
for lunch, Colonel.

550
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,255
George, I'm afraid the colonel
won't have time.

551
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,884
Don't deny it, Paul. You've been hiding
this man, keeping him for your own.

552
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,886
I think that was very selfish of you.

553
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,513
Thank you for your courtesy, General,

554
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:53,015
but I'm afraid there isn't
much time between now and 3:00.

555
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,560
Of course, Colonel. I shall look forward
to the pleasure of seeing you again.

556
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,645
[Clicks Heels]

557
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,792
- Yes, Captain? What is it?
- You ordered me to report to you here, sir.

558
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,878
- Captain Rousseau, battery commander, sir.
- Yes, yes, of course.

559
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:26,757
I wanted to speak to you
about some of your shells falling short.

560
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,009
I haven't time to go into it now.

561
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,261
Report back to your command
until further orders.

562
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,263
- Yes, sir.
- [Heels Click]

563
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,227
- Bad stuff. Demoralizes the men.
- I quite agree with you.

564
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:41,021
And the best solution
is to shelve him to another outfit.

565
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,315
A court of inquiry
ought to roast him a bit first.

566
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,943
Well, in cases like this.
shells falling short.

567
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,028
I. I always try to avoid an inquiry.

568
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,323
It gets around among the men
and makes a bad impression.

569
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,909
No, shelving will be the best discipline
for him, in my opinion.

570
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:56,954
- Well, perhaps you're right.
- Oh, uh, would you excuse me for a moment?

571
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,164
A regimental matter
I want to mention to the colonel.

572
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,750
- I'll join you in the dining room.
- Splendid. In a moment.

573
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,796
That will be Captain Sancy,
Captain Renouart and Lieutenant Roget.

574
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,302
Yes, sir.

575
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:08,799
Have them meet me at regimental
headquarters in half an hour.

576
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,801
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel Dax.

577
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,596
- Yes, sir.
- I'd like a word with you.

578
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,890
Certainly, sir.

579
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,643
Let's be sensible about this.

580
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,979
Sensible, sir?

581
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,814
Listen to me, Dax.

582
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,650
Drop this fancy talk with me, understand?

583
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,571
General Broulard seems to think
you're funny. I don't.

584
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:34,867
- Now, I want you to drop this affair.
- I beg your pardon, sir. Is that an order?

585
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:38,579
Colonel Dax, when this mess is cleaned up,
I'll break you.

586
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:42,166
I'll find an excuse and I'll break you
to the ranks. I'll ruin you.

587
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,168
And it'll be just what you deserve...

588
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,171
showing such little loyalty
to your commanding officer.

589
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,256
That's all, Colonel.

590
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,279
[Officer]
Detail, halt!

591
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,908
General Mireau feels that the attack
on the Anthill yesterday morning failed...

592
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,203
because of an inadequate effort
on the part of the First Battalion.

593
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:21,580
Each of you is to select
one man from your company...

594
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:25,709
place him under arrest and have him ready
to appear before a general court-martial...

595
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,212
no later than 1500 hours this afternoon.

596
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:30,631
The charge is cowardice
in the face of the enemy.

597
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,800
You have your orders, gentlemen.
Let's carry them out.

598
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:56,240
But Lieutenant Roget
killed Lejeune on that patrol...

599
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:58,575
and then blackmailed me
into keeping quiet about the whole thing!

600
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,161
- That's why he picked me.
- Corporal, I understand your feelings.

601
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:04,039
But that story has nothing to do
with the charges you're being tried for.

602
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:08,168
- Don't you believe me, sir?
- Yes, I do, but who else will?

603
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,587
You've got no witnesses.

604
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:14,591
Besides, such charges against an officer
would only antagonize the court.

605
00:43:14,676 --> 00:43:18,136
When we get clear of this,
I'm going into the story of that patrol again.

606
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:22,015
Sir, in my case, Captain Renouart
had the sergeant draw lots.

607
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,559
I was picked purely by chance.

608
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,937
You're lucky. Look at me.

609
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:31,441
I was just picked because Captain Sancy
said I was a social undesirable.

610
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,860
Me, a social undesirable, Colonel.

611
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,157
- I didn't act like a coward.
Picking by lots. is that fair?

612
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:37,281
Neither did I! Major Vignon.

613
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,492
Gentlemen! You've all got to understand that
the reason you were picked is immaterial.

614
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,246
Whatever the reason,
you're on trial for your lives.

615
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,127
Stick to the stories you've told me...

616
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,421
and don't let the prosecutor
shake you out of them.

617
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,800
Now remember, you'll be soldiers
in the presence of superior officers.

618
00:43:56,884 --> 00:44:00,679
So act like what you are. soldiers.

619
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,140
And brave ones at that.

620
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,225
Now, I've been in the room
you'll be sitting in.

621
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,311
The afternoon sun will be in your faces...

622
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:11,189
so don't let it seem as if you’re
dropping your eyes in a hangdog manner.

623
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,776
When you answer questions,
look the judges in the eye.

624
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,821
Don't whine, plead or make speeches.
That's my job.

625
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,823
Simple statements. short...

626
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,950
but make them so they can be heard
all over the room.

627
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,577
And try not to repeat yourselves.

628
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,662
I'll do that for you when I sum up.

629
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:27,205
Now, we haven't much time.

630
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,334
The court-martial begins in about an hour,
and I've got notes to look at.

631
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,671
Good luck.

632
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,715
- Thank you, sir.
- Colonel, sir.

633
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,767
On the left, ho!

634
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,689
Detail, halt!

635
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:56,026
Prisoners, right heel!

636
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,570
On the left, ho!

637
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,079
On the left, ho!

638
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,626
Left face!

639
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,300
The court-martial is open.
The prisoners may be seated.

640
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,642
[Coughs]
This is a general court-martial.

641
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,604
We shall therefore dispense
with unnecessary formalities.

642
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:36,274
These men are charged
with cowardice in the face of the enemy...

643
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,360
and will be tried for that offense.

644
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:43,448
- Mr. Prosecutor.
- Call the accused. Private Ferol.

645
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,450
Mr. President.

646
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:49,413
Will the prosecutor question the witnesses
without even reading the indictment?

647
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:53,083
Please don't take up the court's time
with technicalities.

648
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,294
The indictment is lengthy,
and there's no point in reading it.

649
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,214
The defense has a right to know
the exact accusations.

650
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,259
The indictment is that the accused showed
cowardice in the face of the enemy...

651
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,511
during the attack on the Anthill.

652
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,556
Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.

653
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,392
Call the accused. Private Ferol.

654
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,280
- Private Ferol.
- Yes, sir?

655
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:25,866
Were you in the first wave
during the attack on the Anthill?

656
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,659
Yes, sir.

657
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,705
- Did you refuse to advance?
- No, sir.

658
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,749
- Did you advance?
- Yes, sir.

659
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,751
How far did you advance?

660
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:40,130
To about the middle
of no-man's-land, sir.

661
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,424
Then what did you do?

662
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,426
There were machine-gun bullets
landing all around.

663
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,887
Answer the question.
What did you do?

664
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:51,349
Well, I saw that me and Meyer, sir.

665
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,560
I didn't ask you what you saw.

666
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,564
The court has no concern
with your... visual experiences.

667
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,109
- My what, sir?
- Prisoner will reply to the question.

668
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:03,111
Yes, sir. What question was it?

669
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:06,823
You advanced to the middle of
no-man's-land. What did you do then?

670
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:09,659
- Then, sir?
- Did you go back or forward?

671
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,411
I went back, sir.

672
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:16,374
In other words, Private Ferol,
you retreated.

673
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,960
Yes, sir.

674
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:22,714
That's all.
The accused may return to his seat.

675
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,008
Just a minute.

676
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,720
Mr. President, I'd like
to question the witness if I may.

677
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,224
- Proceed, Colonel.
- Thank you.

678
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,393
Now, Private Ferol, when you reached
the middle of no-man's-land...

679
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,647
- were you alone with Private Meyer?
- Yes, sir.

680
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,941
Well, what happened to the rest
of your company?

681
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,360
Well, I don't know, sir.

682
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,445
I guess the rest of them
had been killed or wounded.

683
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,533
And you found yourself in the middle
of no-man's-land alone with Private Meyer.

684
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:50,951
Yes, sir.

685
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,786
Why didn't you attack the Anthill
single-handed?

686
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:56,957
[Exhales]

687
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,876
Why didn't you storm the Anthill alone?

688
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,588
Just me and Meyer?
You're kidding, sir.

689
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:05,715
Yes, I'm kidding, Private Ferol.

690
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,509
Thank you. That's all.

691
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,303
I don't see the point
of this line of questioning.

692
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:12,597
Well, I'm attempting to indicate, sir...

693
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:16,768
the utter absurdity of the line of questioning
used by the prosecutor.

694
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,853
Mr. Prosecutor.

695
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:23,358
So you freely admit, Private Ferol,
that you retreated.

696
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,236
Yes, sir. Me and Meyer both.

697
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,156
I knew we should've took Anthill,
but we came on back.

698
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,744
[Dax]
That's all.

699
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:38,331
The accused may return to his seat.

700
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,596
Private Arnaud, did you advance?

701
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,434
Yes, sir, until I was ordered
back to the trenches by Captain Renouart.

702
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,603
How far did you advance?

703
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,605
Into the wire, sir.

704
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:05,400
The, uh, enemy wire, I suppose.

705
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,485
No, sir. It was our wire.

706
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:14,200
You mean to tell me that you didn't
advance any further than our wire?

707
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,244
No, sir, I didn't.

708
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:20,999
How far would you say that was?
How many meters?

709
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,710
Well, I advanced as far as I could.

710
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,962
How many meters?

711
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,214
Not many.

712
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,344
"Not many."

713
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:40,310
Now, Private Arnaud,
before you were ordered back...

714
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,729
did you urge your fellow soldiers forward?

715
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:47,651
Most of them were dead or wounded before
they got three steps beyond the trenches.

716
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:49,194
Reply to the question.

717
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,863
I didn't urge them on. No, sir.

718
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,452
Thank you.

719
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,919
Private Arnaud.

720
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,004
At ease, please.

721
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:13,259
Aside from your sad failure to give throat
to spirited battle cries...

722
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:16,471
was your behavior different in any respect
from that of the other men in your company?

723
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,349
Objection. That's a matter of conjecture.

724
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,643
Sustained.

725
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,524
Did any men in your company
get beyond our wire?

726
00:50:27,608 --> 00:50:28,983
No, sir.

727
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:31,486
Is it true that you've been
designated a coward...

728
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,406
simply and purely because you drew
a slip of paper marked "X"?

729
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,367
- Yes, sir.
- I don't see that that's significant.

730
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,246
It's accepted practice in the French army
to pick examples by lot.

731
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,873
And since this entire company
advanced only a few meters...

732
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,876
picking by lot
was eminently fair in this case.

733
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:49,713
Well, I'd like to point out that this soldier
has distinguished himself...

734
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,340
in some of the bloodiest battles
of the war.

735
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,135
With the court's permission...

736
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:58,722
I'll read citations for bravery
that he's already earned on two occasions.

737
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:03,435
First, citations in the Orders in the Army
for bravery.

738
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,019
That's immaterial, Colonel.

739
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,063
The accused is not being tried
for his former bravery...

740
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:09,149
but for his recent cowardice.

741
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:11,317
Medals are no defense.

742
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:16,448
May I call witnesses to his character?

743
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,283
You may not.

744
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:21,995
But you may call witnesses to the effect
that he reached the German wire.

745
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,750
Mr. President,
no one in the entire regiment...

746

including myself.

[Prosecutor]
So you never even left the trenches.

752
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:55,528
- No, sir.
- That's all.

753
00:51:56,489 --> 00:52:00,742
Corporal Paris,
why didn't you leave the trenches?

754
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:06,122
Major Vignon was shot, and he fell back
on top of me, sir, and knocked me cold.

755
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,959
And were you lying unconscious
in the trenches during the entire attack?

756
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,795
Yes, sir.

757
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,380
That's all.

758
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:16,424
Have you any witnesses to that?

759
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:20,512
No, sir. I guess everybody
was too busy to notice me.

760
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,472
And there were so many others
lying dead anyway.

761
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,642
- But you have no witnesses.
- No, sir.

762
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:29,479
I only have a rather large cut
on my head, sir.

763
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,773
That could have been self-inflicted later.

764
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,611
- Thank you. You may stand down.
- [Clicks Heels]

765
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,410
Mr. Prosecutor,
you can make your plea now.

766
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,584
Gentlemen of the court...

767
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,797
this case speaks for itself.

768
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,342
All of us witnessed
the regrettable attack yesterday morning.

769
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,306
And I submit that that attack...

770
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:10,186
was a stain on the flag of France...

771
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,689
a blot on the honor...

772
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:15,942
of every man, woman and child
in the French nation.

773
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:23,867
It is to us that the sad, distressing...

774
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:27,620
repellant duty falls, gentlemen.

775
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:33,960
I ask this court
to find the accused guilty...

776
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:41,593
and impose the penalties prescribed
by the Code of Military Justice.

777
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,390
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

778
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:51,019
Colonel, would you like
to make your plea?

779
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,573
Gentlemen of the court,
there are times when I'm ashamed...

780
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,283
to be a member of the human race...

781
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,619
and this is one such occasion.

782
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:13,499
It's impossible for me to summarize
the case for the defense...

783
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:17,462
since the court never allowed me
a reasonable opportunity to present my case.

784
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,465
Are you protesting
the authenticity of this court?

785
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,261
Yes, sir.

786
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:28,097
I protest against being prevented
from introducing evidence...

787
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,726
that I consider vital to the defense.

788
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,603
The prosecution presented no witnesses.

789
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:38,983
There has never been a written indictment
of charges made against the defendants.

790
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:41,778
And lastly, I protest against the fact...

791
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,031
that no stenographic records
of this trial have been kept.

792
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:59,337
The attack yesterday morning
was no stain on the honor of France...

793
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,384
and certainly no disgrace
to the fighting men of this nation.

794
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:09,681
But this court-martial is such a stain
and such a disgrace.

795
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:13,726
The case made against these men
is a mockery of all human justice.

796
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,479
Gentlemen of the court...

797
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,232
to find these men guilty...

798
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:23,486
would be a crime
to haunt each of you...

799
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,571
till the day you die.

800
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:34,038
I can't believe
that the noblest impulse of man.

801
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:37,125
his compassion for another
can be completely dead here.

802
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,587
Therefore, I humbly beg you...

803
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:45,967
show mercy to these men.

804
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,393
The accused will be escorted
back to the guardroom.

805
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,395
The hearing is closed.

806
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,981
The court will now retire to deliberate.

807
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,983
There will be a guard of six men under arms.

808
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,570
rifles loaded, bayonets fixed.
two men to each prisoner.

809
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,031
Any sign of trouble,
the prisoners will be instantly covered.

810
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:12,035
And if the trouble doesn't subside at once,
the prisoner will be shot on the spot.

811
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,455
Everything must go off without a hitch
with the least possible delay...

812
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,457
but it shouldn't be hurried.

813
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,500
There must be no fumbling around.

814
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:22,587
I've been put in charge
and made personally responsible...

815
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:25,798
for any lack of order or for any mistakes.

816
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:30,845
But you can take it from me that I shall
pass on any blame. and with interest.

to any one of you who fails in his duties.

818
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:39,645
Execution will take place at 7:00
according to the verdict of the court-martial.

819
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:45,109

- Duck.
- Well, tell him thanks.

822

Oh, don't blame me, soldier.

823
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,549
Hey, ugly, what are we supposed
to eat this with. our fingers?

824
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:12,428
The guard says you can't have
any knives or forks.

825
00:57:12,513 --> 00:57:14,597
[Paris] Is this supposed to be
our last meal or something?

826
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,392
It isn't "supposed to be" our last meal.
It is our last meal.

I think they put something in it.

Like what?

00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:37,036
Like, uh. Like something
or make us groggy or something.

What would be wrong with that
if they did?

gonna kill us in a few hours if we don't.

- No, but there's gotta be a way.

How many guards
you think they've got out there?

842
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:07,358
They may have a couple of squads.
That's what it sounded like this morning.

- Maybe they're some of our friends.
- That's the Third Battalion.

Anyway, right now, we have no friends.

We're not gonna get out of this.

- It's to my wife.

Do you want me to hear your confession?

Well, Father, to tell you the truth,
I'm not very religious.

I know you're trying to help,
and I appreciate it...

What are you hanging around for.
to torture us?

899
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,654
- No. To help you with all my power.
- Your power? You have no power!

900
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:00,740
- Come on, Arnaud, take it easy.
- No, but God has power.

901
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:03,034
- Does he? What a laugh!
- You can be saved.

902
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:04,869
Saved? I'll be saved!

903
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,249
Cut it out, Arnaud!

904
01:01:10,334 --> 01:01:12,251
Arnaud!

905
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:14,337
Arnaud.

906
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,553
Father, get a doctor. Quick.

907
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,732
[Doctor]
That should keep him quiet long enough.

908
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,693
That's a nasty skull fracture though.
He may not live out the night.

909
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:39,695
What are we supposed
to do with him?

910
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,449
My advice is to tie him to a stretcher
so that he won't slip when you tilt it vertically.

911
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,452
Surely they won't execute a man
in that condition.

912
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,454
I'm sorry, Father.
The sentence will be carried out.

913
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,956
I've already checked
with the general on it.

914
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,958
If he's still alive in the morning...

915
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,294
pinch his cheeks a couple of times
before you take him out on the field.

916
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:58,172
It may make him open his eyes.
The general wants him to be conscious.

917
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,175
- [Knocking]
- [Dax] Yes?

- Lieutenant Roget reporting, sir.
- Come in, come in.

919
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:10,851
Sergeant Boulanger said
that you wanted to see me, sir.

920
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,645
Yes, Lieutenant.

921
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,232
Looks as if we have a pretty unpleasant thing
on our hands in a few hours, doesn't it?

922
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:19,068
- You mean the execution, sir.
- Yes, I mean the execution.

923
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,237
Yes, sir. It's very unfortunate.

924
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,532
Oh, very unfortunate.
That’s just how I feel about it.

925
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:26,534
None of us are happy about it, sir.

926
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:30,079
How'd you happen to pick Corporal Paris?

927
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,791
- Well, I. I had to pick somebody, sir.
- That's right. You did.

928
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,419
Of course, you had no personal motive
in picking Paris, did you?

929
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,671
Oh, no, sir.

930
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,965
You picked him because
he was a coward, didn't you?

931
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:46,512
- Well, did you or didn't you?
- Oh, yes, sir, I did.

932
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:49,181
[Exhales]
Well.

933
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,059
Like you say,
somebody had to be picked.

934
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:55,771
- Oh, it was quite a problem, sir.
- Yes, I have the same kind of problem.

935
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:58,691
I have to pick someone to be in charge
of the firing squad tomorrow.

936
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,860
Do you have any objections
to taking the job?

937
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,738
- Me, sir?
- Yes, you.

938
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,951
- Well.
- What's the matter? Don't you feel well?

939
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,120
[Stammering]
Well, no. Yeah, l-I feel all right, sir.

940
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,539
- It’s just that I.
- Is it too hot in here?

941
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:16,208
- Would you like me to open a window?
- No, sir. No, sir.

942
01:03:16,293 --> 01:03:21,547
Well, it's. It’s just that I've never been
in charge of a firing squad before, sir.

943
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,758
Oh, there's nothing to it.

944
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,178
First, you help the sergeant
tie the men to the posts.

945
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:29,221
Of course, you offer the men blindfolds.

946
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:32,308
And, well, if they want them,
you tie them on, see?

947
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,477
Now, you.you take your position
with the firing squad...

948
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:37,813
you raise your sword.
"Ready, aim, fire."

949
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:41,942
Then you draw your revolver out,
you walk forward...

950
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:44,320
and put a bullet
through each man's head.

951
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,991
Sir, I request that I be excused
from this duty.

952
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,243
Request denied.

953
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,245
- Colonel, I.
- You've got the job.

954

That's all, Lieutenant.

955

- That's all, Lieutenant!

01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,169

957
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,464
- Excuse me, sir. Colonel Dax?
- Yes.

958

01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:17,102
I have something to tell you, sir, that may
have a great bearing on the court-martial.

961
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,272

- Good evening. Come and sit down.
- Thank you, sir. I.

01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,668
I am really sorry
to intrude on you in this way.

968
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,920
Not at all.
Always delighted to see you, Colonel Dax.

969

- Will you have a cigar?
- No, thank you, sir, but.

- Well, I.
- [Chuckling] I think you’ll find it delicious.

971
01:05:31,303 --> 01:05:34,013
I must apologize for not inviting you
to join the party downstairs tonight...

972
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:37,099
but I'm afraid that it's, uh,
a dress affair.

973
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:42,605
Well, thank you, sir, but I must confess
that, uh, this is not entirely a social visit.

974
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:47,276
Oh, come, Dax, let's not
go over all that ground again.

975
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,780
Though, uh, I must admit that,
judging from the casualties...

976
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,949
the efforts of your regiment
must have been considerable.

977
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:57,411
Now, how can you understand that
and allow these men to be shot tomorrow?

978
01:05:57,495 --> 01:06:00,456
Oh, come, Colonel. You're choosing
to take a rather simple view of this thing.

979
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:04,543
The attack was impossible from the start.
The General Staff must have known that.

980
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:10,382
Colonel Dax, we think we're doing
a good job running the war.

981
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,384
You must be aware of the fact
that the General Staff...

982
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:16,555
is subject to all kinds of unfair pressures
from newspapers and politicians.

983
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:19,266
Maybe the attack against the Anthill
was impossible.

984
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:21,769
Perhaps it was an error of judgment
on our part.

985
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:26,023
On the other hand, if your men had been
a little more daring, they might have taken it.

986
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,609
Who knows? In any case...

987
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:32,321
why should we have to bear any more
criticism for failure than we have to.

988
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,991
Aside from the inescapable fact that a good
many of your men never left the trenches...

989
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:38,619
there's the question of the troops' morale.
Don't forget that.

990
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,579
- The troops' morale?
- Certainly.

991
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:43,666
These executions will be a perfect tonic
for the entire division.

992
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,168
There are few things more fundamentally
encouraging and stimulating...

993
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,212
than seeing someone else die.

994
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:51,173
- I never thought of that, sir.
- You see, Colonel, troops are like children.

995
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,677
Just as a child wants his father to be firm,
troops crave discipline.

996
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,220
I see.

997
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,847
And one way to maintain discipline
is to shoot a man now and then.

998
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,351
May I ask...

999
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,437
do you sincerely believe
all the things you’ve just said?

1000
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,403
It's been a pleasure
discussing this with you, Colonel...

1001
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:15,864
but I'm afraid that I'd better
be getting back to my guests.

1002
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:18,325
Forgive me for having kept you
from your party.

1003
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:24,540
Oh, by the way, sir,
have you heard that General Mireau...

1004
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:28,043
ordered his own battery commander,
Captain Rousseau...

1005
01:07:28,128 --> 01:07:30,838
to open fire on his own positions
during the attack?

1006
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,423
# [Waltz Continues]

1007
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:38,053
Well, of course the captain refused
without a written order...

1008
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:42,391
but General Mireau demanded that he
commence firing on our own trenches.

1009
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,977
Again Rousseau refused
without an order in writing...

1010
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:49,189
but again he was ordered,
and again he refused.

1011
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,191
all in front of witnesses.

1012
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:54,069
Do you actually believe
this fantastic story?

1013
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:58,240
Here are copies of the sworn statements
from all the principals involved.

1014
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:01,910
Battery Commander Rousseau,
Captain Nichols, the artillery spotter...

1015
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:05,748
the telephone clerk and, uh,
my own deposition.

1016
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:10,002
What has all this got to do with the charge
against the condemned prisoners?

1017
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,756
A general in a tantrum over the failure
of an impossible attack...

1018
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,341
orders his artillery to fire on his own men.

1019
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,429
Now, this same officer on the same day...

1020
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,849
orders a court-martial in which
three of his men are sentenced to be shot.

1021
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:30,564
General, what would your, uh, newspapers
and your politicians do with that?

1022
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,109
Colonel Dax, are you trying
to blackmail me?

1023
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:38,322
Sir, that's an ugly word,
but you are in a difficult position.

1024
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,324
Too much has happened.
Someone's got to be hurt.

1025
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,409
The only question is who.

1026
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:47,706
General Mireau's assault
on the Anthill failed...

1027
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:51,627
and his order to fire on this own troops
was refused.

1028
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:53,962
But his attempt to murder
three innocent men...

1029
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:58,175
to protect his own reputation
will be prevented by the General Staff.

1030
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:07,476
Will you pardon me, Colonel Dax?

that you're a degenerate,
sadistic old man...

1197
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:58,853
and you can go to hell before I apologize
to you now or ever again!

1198
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:04,609
Colonel Dax, you're a disappointment to me.

1199
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:09,739
You've spoiled the keenness of your mind
by wallowing in sentimentality.

1200
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,866
You really did want to save those men...

1201
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:14,702
and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

1202
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:18,706
You're an idealist, and I pity you
as I would the village idiot.

1203
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:21,209
We're fighting a war, Dax,
a war that we've got to win.

1204
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,211
Those men didn't fight,
so they were shot.

1205
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:27,215
You bring charges against General Mireau,
so I insist that he answer them.

1206
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,008
Wherein have I done wrong?

1207
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,265
Because you don't know
the answer to that question...

1208
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:40,019
I pity you.

Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

- It's true the little lady has her limitations.

1233
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,917
As a matter of fact,
she has absolutely no talent at all.

except, that is,
well, maybe a little natural talent?

She has a throat of gold.
