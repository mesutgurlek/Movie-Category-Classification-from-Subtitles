20 minutes to finish.

We have much time.

00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:09,095
What makes Nancy? - In dreams.

23
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:10,781
We have to go in the trees!

24
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:13,851
Fuck! We have to go in the trees.

25
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,743
Care!

26
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,133

Retreat!

Come on.

31
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:53,961
Lewis!

32
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,693
Stand up!

33
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,418
Caution on your side!

34
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,422
Lewis!

35
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:35,885
Come on! You have 10 minutes!

36
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,300
Jones is ready to go, sir.

37
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:38,136
Tell leave.

38
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:39,054
Yes sir.

39
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,024
Are you ready? - Almost.

40
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:46,252
Fuck!

41
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:48,228
<I> Captain Beckett! </ I>

42
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:52,238
Seriously hurt!

43
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:55,450
Where is Nancy? - In the truck.

44
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:57,550
Enough!

45
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,156
Stop the truck!

46
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:02,643
Nancy!

47
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,984
Nancy!

48
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,518
I need immediately.

49
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,667
I said to get on the truck. - Come on, the following is obtained.

50
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:26,074
Come on!

51
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,048
He pressed well! - Hold still, Beckett.

52
00:08:44,462 --> 00:08:46,975
Be still, damn it! - Keep the property!

53
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:48,908
I gave him morphine.

54
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,335
I had to have all gone.

55
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:54,270
We have masks. - Forget it, let's start!

56
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:59,116
We have to go now!

57
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:01,361
We must stop the bleeding, captain, otherwise it will die.

58
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:02,662
To say, continue.

59
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:07,128
If you leave now, we will all die.

60
00:09:10,553 --> 00:09:12,524
Fast, Nancy, gloves.

61
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:14,093
Move on!

62
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,472
We penicillin? - Yes, beer.

63
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:32,175
Come on, I have it. - Maxwell.

64
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:33,220
Maxwell. - Yes.

65
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:36,454
Us out of here.

66
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:39,871
Poth, you can do it anywhere?

67
00:09:39,874 --> 00:09:40,847
With nothing.

68
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,769
How much time do we have? - Approximately 10 minutes, sir.

69
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:46,501
You have five minutes.

70
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,231
Are you okay? - Yes sir.

71
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:01,141
No injuries. - I did not mean it.

72
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:04,838
What have you got there?

73
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:06,813
Let chairetoures.

74
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,320
He gave it to my sister.

75
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:14,171
Probably for luck.

76
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:16,704
Yes, everyone has something.

77
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:19,818
This is your own?

78
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,216
The lucky charm?

79
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:24,029
It's just a lighter.

80
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:26,857
How it is called? - Lewis, sir.

81
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,400
Your child? - James.

82
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:32,670
Well, soldier James Lewis. You Again keep perspective?

83
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:36,837
Yes sir. - Well, be careful lest the Nazis show.

84
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,040
Mr? - Yes.

85
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:42,446
What should I do if I see someone? - Do not let go.

86
00:10:49,032 --> 00:10:52,384
How's the pressure? - Okay.

87
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:55,897
Pinza.

88
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:58,642
He went.

89
00:12:30,238 --> 00:12:33,902
Do not drop, do not throw! Is the hospital is a hospital!

90
00:12:38,146 --> 00:12:39,466
The doctors!

91
00:12:41,388 --> 00:12:43,713
Good good! We give up!

92
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:46,972
The doctors!

93
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:51,192
Go see what's happening outside.

94
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:03,505
Hurry up!

95
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,587
Ahead!

96
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:13,759
We are in the middle of surgery.

97
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,864
As you can see, you are all prisoners of the Third Reich.

98
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:26,071
Immediately get everyone out.

99
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,221
Doctor told me immediately.

100
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:38,650
Doctor, please!

101
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:41,348
If not stitch the wound, he shall die.

102
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,321
You refuse the order?

103
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:58,630
I begged him to be quiet, to finish my work.

104
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:10,616
Get them all.

105
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:17,300
Please! Must be completed.

106
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:20,958
What is your name?

107
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:25,069
Vera Cornish lieutenant.

108
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,455
Vera, do you have a minute.

109
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,208
Nancy.

110
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,372
Everything will be fine. - I don `t believe.

111
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,864
We are prisoners of war will not harm us.

112
00:15:59,867 --> 00:16:01,611
Shot the doctor.

113
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:02,695
Connect!

114
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:05,683
You can shut up!

115
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:58,019
Do not drop!

116
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:01,813
On the bus there are only American prisoners.

117
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,691
The vehicle is only prisoners.

118
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:15,207
We are American.

119
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:21,046
Really? So, tell me what is the best American baseball team?

120
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:28,434
Maybe you think you would say New York, but I would say Brooklyn.

121
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:30,690
Brooklyn?

122
00:17:31,186 --> 00:17:32,767
He did not answer that.

123
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:44,202
I would say Boston, but I think it would kill me.

124
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:45,882
I can do yet.

125
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:51,224
Wow! We hit? - No. I was hurt.

126
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:55,274
I'm sorry about that. We thought we were carrying weapons.

127
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:59,019
No problem, I needed a haircut.

128
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:01,276
You're lucky. There is almost never miss.

129
00:18:05,433 --> 00:18:07,901
Where we are? What is your unit?

130
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,164
We just me and Fischer.

131
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,536
When we were t 'parachutes were dissected from our unit.

132
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:15,037
We hope to use your radio to contact them.

133
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:17,288
Block, taken and destroyed. - Fuck! Really?

134
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:20,343
You do not know any signal. - Vos got away, I cleaned them.

135
00:18:20,345 --> 00:18:21,995
What No, no. - Do not you hit them all?

136
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,632
No. Two of them fled.

137
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,389
Come on guys. Vera, stay in the truck.

138
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,404
You can eat anything? - Something German trash.

139
00:18:37,606 --> 00:18:39,169
Liver pate! (Pork liver)

140
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,969
Awesome name.

141
00:18:41,464 --> 00:18:42,507
Wow!

142
00:18:44,278 --> 00:18:47,240
He pressed it, friend! He squeezed it with all your might!

143
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,291
Fish!

144
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,209
Down!

145
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,817
He continued to push!

146
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:01,416
Vera!

147
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,742
There have sulfamino? - Searching!

148
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:06,903
Go get it. Go!

149
00:19:06,905 --> 00:19:08,700
Cover me!

150
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,224
Come on!

151
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:17,080
Wait! He pressed it, friend!

152
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,360
He pressed well, right?

153
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:28,769
My mother is ... - Do not worry about it,

154
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:31,461
will become so, do you hear me? You will get well.

155
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,313
Vera which is the sulfamic?

156
00:19:33,637 --> 00:19:35,767
Maxwell.

157
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:40,152
I took.

158
00:19:43,326 --> 00:19:44,610
I will fix it.

159
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:48,526
You will get well.

160
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:53,225
We will organize these two, and then will take care, okay?

161
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:54,689
Do not sleep!

162
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,774
Anderson! I want to go to the trees.

163
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:01,047
Try to get your right.

164
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:02,493
You understand? - Yes sir.

165
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:08,272
My name Grieg, sir. - Grieg, I want to go left.

166
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:11,625
When put in the middle, take them.

167
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:15,437
Lewis, you do not do anything to stop shooting, you understand?

168
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,791
Yes sir. - You understand?

169
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:18,405
Yes sir. - It's okay.

170
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:23,218
Fiss, please wait!

171
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:32,674
Are you still here?

172
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,401
Dammit!

173
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,421
Go!

174
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,974
Come on!

175
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:12,063
I give up!

176
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,634
I give up!

177
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:19,024
Get!

178
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:46,727
Do not try not to move yet.

179
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:50,750
I'm sorry. Finally, Mr.

180
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,207
How I ordered the withdrawal come about? - It is unfortunate, sir.

181
00:22:00,646 --> 00:22:02,025
Lewis!

182
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:06,887
I'm glad you're all right, sir.

183
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:10,537
Who told you I'm fine? - I'm sorry Mr.

184
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:13,896
You did it to save your ass?

185
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:15,387
Yes sir.

186
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:19,217
Where we are?

187
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:23,934
We fight with two people. His only he surrendered.

188
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,414
We lost our? - Yes sir.

189
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,610
The Maxwell is alive? - Yes, it's in the truck.

190
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:41,443
Who the hell is that?

191
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,456
SS officer, Otto Dietrich.

192
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,886
He is our prisoner. - Oh my God! Bring me the Maxwell!

193
00:22:52,589 --> 00:22:53,706
We were lucky?

194
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,226
Nothing useful, except that map.

195
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,075
Grieg was right. They destroyed the radio.

196
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:02,964
The captain met. - Really?

197
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:09,582
We start here, and the decline started from here.

198
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,724
We went in this direction for an hour and a quarter, maybe half.

199
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,383
I think we're through here.

200
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:21,491
Fuck! - In approx.

201
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:23,381
Captain!

202
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:26,665
What it is this - going to help you walk, sir.

203
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:30,876
My hardware is limited.

204
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,906
And mine own.

205
00:23:39,394 --> 00:23:41,324
It not meant for the present.

206
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:44,817
I know what it means.

207
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:48,225
At best, we will walk 50 km.

208
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:52,304
And at worst? - Much more.

209
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:07,366
You can not walk much.

210
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:13,174
It seems you can. - Because not even the action of the drug was approved.

211
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:16,234
You better start.

212
00:25:08,922 --> 00:25:10,557
First ladies.

213
00:25:11,473 --> 00:25:12,883
First Captain.

214
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:56,670
Nancy.

215
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,797
This name is very common in the Netherlands.

216
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:02,343
You is not Dutch, right?

217
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:07,170
Do not.

218
00:26:08,064 --> 00:26:10,423
I know I have no right to ask your ...

219
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,757
I have an itch behind her ear, and I can not xytho.

220
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,594
I wonder if ...

221
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:25,726
Never mind, forget it. I do not want to feel uncomfortable.

222
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,377
In this ear? - Yes.

223
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:52,413
Thank you. Bran.

224
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:55,811
What are you doing?

225
00:26:57,251 --> 00:27:00,331
Nothing. Dietrich had an itch.

226
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:02,871
They did not say.

227
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,293
His name is "Nazis".

228
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,437
Tell all down!

229
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:11,702
If you speak, you die!

230
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:23,109
No, damn it!

231
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:25,563
Let it down! Let your gun!

232
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:26,608
Let it down!

233
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:29,914
No, do not leave me! - He went down!

234
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,728
Shut up you!

235
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,492
Let it down! You're surrounded!

236
00:28:34,494 --> 00:28:36,655
He left immediately ... Shut up!

237
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:39,043
Let it down! You're surrounded!

238
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:41,870
He left immediately ... Shut up!

239
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:42,915
Shoot your weapon!

240
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:57,499
Where is the rest?

241
00:28:58,122 --> 00:28:59,718
He would not be alone, right?

242
00:29:00,912 --> 00:29:03,110
Only it was.

243
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,577
You say that you were a coward?

244
00:29:08,095 --> 00:29:10,219
Today more as I look.

245
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,735
I'm fine. I'm fine, Lieutenant.

246
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:24,781
Did I do something wrong?

247
00:29:25,465 --> 00:29:26,633
Do not.

248
00:29:33,832 --> 00:29:35,325
What you looking at?

249
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,519
Who you are?

250
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:29,308
Hello! Do you speak English?

251
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:32,929
You are Americans? - Yes.

252
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:35,601
Please!

253
00:30:35,603 --> 00:30:37,659
Need your help. - I can not help you.

254
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:40,563
Our captain, painful injury.

255
00:30:42,642 --> 00:30:44,041
Do not worry.

256
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:48,774
We can not fail.

257
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:55,095
Tell your friends, to leave their weapons outside.

258
00:30:58,127 --> 00:31:00,263
The place seems very quiet.

259
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,243
I grew up on a farm.

260
00:31:05,807 --> 00:31:07,500
I did not know that you are in the province.

261
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:09,295
Yes ...

262
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:13,477
My family wakes up when the rooster crowed.

263
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:18,506
Straw, who reminded me of my home.

264
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:26,328
You miss your parents?

265
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,959
I miss my mother.

266
00:31:31,353 --> 00:31:32,860
And your father?

267
00:31:35,804 --> 00:31:36,995
He ...

268
00:31:37,835 --> 00:31:39,528
She left when I was 8 years old.

269
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:44,256
Again you've seen since then?

270
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,161
I do not want to see.

271
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:56,856
Not worth doing that to my mother and my sister.

272
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,312
How many are you

273
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:10,580
Six people. - All Americans?

274
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:12,339
Same as you?

275
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:14,165
Yes.

276
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,188
Please phone or mobile? - Phone only find in the city.

277
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:22,294
Can you go there? We need medicines.

278
00:32:22,296 --> 00:32:27,357
There are many Germans there. It is very hard going.

279
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:33,051
And you have to leave. - We have no food and water.

280
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:34,771
There is a hotel here.

281
00:32:35,575 --> 00:32:37,247
We are aware of the dangers.

282
00:32:38,506 --> 00:32:39,837
Really?

283
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,096
Who else lives here? - Anyone.

284
00:32:46,277 --> 00:32:47,625
What is Lady?

285
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,038
My wife.

286
00:32:53,709 --> 00:32:55,511
Where is?

287
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:57,475
He has died.

288
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,663
Maxwell, can leave us a little peace?

289
00:33:26,162 --> 00:33:28,433
I am very sorry about your husband.

290
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:36,060
What do you think?

291
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:40,317
If alive, he would not help us?

292
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:43,677
I'm not talking about my wife, now.

293
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,279
And I lost my husband.

294
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:58,316
He died in hospital in Africa.

295
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:05,698
So I became a nurse.

296
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:11,665
Whatever you do ... I hope that my husband would be proud of me.

297
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:15,972
What do you think about me now.

298
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:22,395
My wife was very attentive.

299
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:24,335
Nor will leave.

300
00:34:25,808 --> 00:34:27,165
I do not believe you.

301
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:31,637
I do not believe you!

302
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:35,307
What do you say, no honors.

303
00:34:50,514 --> 00:34:52,960
Have you ever wanted to go to New York.

304
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:56,181
The same also.

305
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:16,959
Well are you?

306
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,265
Are we going to let him sleep in the barn and give us food.

307
00:35:43,331 --> 00:35:45,721
If I had to shoot him in the head.

308
00:35:46,546 --> 00:35:49,827
In order to fire.

309
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:52,542
I know, sir.

310
00:35:53,711 --> 00:35:56,103
I saw nothing to do.

311
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:59,741
I do not want to betray our position to the Germans, sir.

312
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:02,783
When you're in a situation, simply pull the trigger.

313
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:06,747
It was my fault, sir.

314
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:09,809
must pull the trigger ... - I'm not talking about the trigger,

315
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:11,657
another was his mistake.

316
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:15,079
He had just shot my friend, there in front of me.

317
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:18,961
This is your excuse? That had just shot his friend?

318
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:22,377
He was like my brother. - You think I do not know?

319
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:25,744
It stands in front of me and tell me?

320
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:30,073
You say bullshit, soldier.

321
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:44,890
Do not be so hard on him. It's just a child.

322
00:36:45,243 --> 00:36:47,666
Take your food, and pull here.

323
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:02,492
Would I mind if I sit with you?

324
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,015
You lost a friend today?

325
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:20,654
I'm sorry.

326
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:29,019
I killed a German today was a child.

327
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,565
I shot him down.

328
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,894
I looked.

329
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:40,559
And I shot him.

330
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,463
This should make me feel good.

331
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:53,712
... That makes a better soldier.

332
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:56,619
That's why we're here, right?

333
00:37:56,936 --> 00:37:58,774
To kill the bad guys.

334
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:03,747
Right.

335
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:16,684
How long have you been here? - A few weeks.

336
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:23,329
Not that as I had imagined.

337
00:38:57,283 --> 00:38:59,824
Your turn is? - Yes sir.

338
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:03,926
You have not slept at all? - Very little.

339
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:17,068
Do not take it seriously, with the captain. - I do not get?

340
00:39:17,908 --> 00:39:19,248
With hatred.

341
00:39:22,938 --> 00:39:24,901
This war ...

342
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:27,177
In change.

343
00:39:28,379 --> 00:39:30,329
We changed all of us.

344
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:36,845
Captain tries to keep alive.

345
00:40:07,192 --> 00:40:09,210
In what situation it is, Lieutenant?

346
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,023
I've seen worse, sir.

347
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:24,797
Contaminated, she needs medicine. - I'm going or I or Lewis.

348
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:27,568
Do you know about drugs? - Would you do me a list.

349
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:30,339
I will not do it. Will I go to town to collect,

350
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:31,973
and take appropriate medications.

351
00:40:31,975 --> 00:40:33,757
I go with Bruno. I will do it.

352
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:35,011
Why are you talking about?

353
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:38,652
Captain's injury. I will try to find and telephone.

354
00:40:38,654 --> 00:40:41,716
We could use sugar. It helps to disinfect the wound.

355
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:44,188
You need actual medication. I have to leave immediately.

356
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,545
I got with you to help.

357
00:40:47,885 --> 00:40:51,304
I was also in the truck. As all of you.

358
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,299
We went to this truck,

359
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:55,595
to save the captain's life.

360
00:41:03,576 --> 00:41:06,795
Well, you can not go that way.

361
00:42:21,753 --> 00:42:23,712
I see myself as a French?

362
00:42:27,071 --> 00:42:28,469
Absolutely.

363
00:42:31,487 --> 00:42:32,836
Are you ready?

364
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:35,283
In a minute.

365
00:42:43,886 --> 00:42:46,706
Will my reservations?

366
00:42:52,626 --> 00:42:54,308
If you die?

367
00:42:56,542 --> 00:42:57,699
Who is?

368
00:43:02,284 --> 00:43:05,483
Lady. Mr.

369
00:43:13,961 --> 00:43:16,853
They Are Bruno Travert? - Yes.

370
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:18,806
Do you speak german?

371
00:43:21,943 --> 00:43:25,308
English; - Yes. Can I help you?

372
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,190
And you? Speak English

373
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,797
Yes, a little.

374
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:39,204
We will do some tests. We will not be late.

375
00:43:47,563 --> 00:43:51,054
It seems that here ... We have a problem.

376
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:00,660
It seems that our records are incomplete.

377
00:44:02,296 --> 00:44:06,165
It says here that in this direction, only the main Travert life.

378
00:44:09,857 --> 00:44:12,449
You are what?

379
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,203
She is my wife.

380
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:22,242
No ring?

381
00:44:22,614 --> 00:44:25,287
The sellers.

382
00:44:27,203 --> 00:44:28,799
The sellers.

383
00:44:30,187 --> 00:44:31,375
To get food.

384
00:44:57,466 --> 00:44:58,775
What is your name?

385
00:45:01,148 --> 00:45:03,068
Margot.

386
00:45:03,856 --> 00:45:05,084
He explained.

387
00:45:05,655 --> 00:45:09,161
MA-P-G-R-OT.

388
00:45:15,937 --> 00:45:17,795
Do you have children

389
00:45:19,805 --> 00:45:21,057
Do not.

390
00:45:24,698 --> 00:45:26,898
You still someone else with you?

391
00:45:27,955 --> 00:45:28,998
Do not.

392
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,820
We take a look.

393
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,087
Do not worry, ma'am.

394
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:51,138
We do this in all the houses.

395
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:57,350
We will go once we finish.

396
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:01,564
Unless ...

397
00:46:02,525 --> 00:46:04,093
Hide someone.

398
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,812
Maybe someone Jewish.

399
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,228
How long have you been married?

400
00:46:28,426 --> 00:46:29,863
15 years.

401
00:46:32,154 --> 00:46:33,749
15 years?

402
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:40,288
This means that you were away from children. - Yes.

403
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:50,587
He stayed single room.

404
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:26,076
To get ahead.

405
00:47:45,936 --> 00:47:47,298
Who sleeps here?

406
00:47:49,138 --> 00:47:50,287
Any.

407
00:47:52,607 --> 00:47:55,574
My brother, when he comes to visit us.

408
00:47:56,513 --> 00:47:59,609
How do you go with your wife?

409
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:03,910
Fine.

410
00:48:05,989 --> 00:48:07,788
I am very sure.

411
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:19,446
What do we have here?

412
00:48:27,828 --> 00:48:30,212
For someone like very sweet.

413
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:41,453
The skin of her husband, Mrs.

414
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:44,504
Want one?

415
00:48:50,403 --> 00:48:51,897
Definitely.

416
00:48:52,192 --> 00:48:53,468
Please.

417
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:12,730
Have you lately seen some unknown in the region,

418
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:13,983
or anyone who has visited?

419
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,045
Do not.

420
00:49:58,539 --> 00:50:01,534
We take a look at the other farm.

421
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,902
Lady. Sir Travert.

422
00:50:07,854 --> 00:50:09,783
We want to see warehouse.

423
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,664
How did these Nazis here. Where is?

424
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:53,709
From the fourth battalion.

425
00:50:55,754 --> 00:50:57,424
Nice shot.

426
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:12,322
Captain. Bruno is ready to take me to the city.

427
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:16,569
Be careful, Lieutenant. - Yes sir.

428
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,579
Nancy, we need more?

429
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:26,870
It's okay.

430
00:51:27,457 --> 00:51:28,751
Vera.

431
00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:32,466
See if you have a cold beer.

432
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:35,746
I had my priorities.

433
00:51:42,738 --> 00:51:44,657
You know we can not take them with us.

434
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:56,075
We can not leave them.

435
00:52:00,578 --> 00:52:01,868
I know.

436
00:52:19,385 --> 00:52:20,524
Move.

437
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:26,651
Move on! - Please let me go.

438
00:52:26,653 --> 00:52:28,886
Shut! - I will not say anything to anyone.

439
00:52:28,888 --> 00:52:29,931
Shut!

440
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:36,564
Please let me go. - Shut!

441
00:52:36,566 --> 00:52:38,651
I will not say anything ... - Shut up!

442
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:40,771
Here.

443
00:52:41,824 --> 00:52:44,336
I will not say anything to anyone. - Genuflection.

444
00:52:45,368 --> 00:52:46,541
Get on your knees!

445
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,810
Please I beg you! I also have a mother.

446
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:51,807
Please, I also have a mother!

447
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:56,104
Her name is Nadia. - Nobody cares about your mother.

448
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:58,040
Please be quiet!

449
00:52:58,042 --> 00:52:59,294
I am the only child.

450
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:01,994
Please, I'm the only child.

451
00:53:01,996 --> 00:53:03,039
Lewis, shut up.

452
00:53:04,527 --> 00:53:07,352
No Please! No no no.

453
00:53:08,432 --> 00:53:09,939
Please!

454
00:53:10,474 --> 00:53:11,586
Shut.

455
00:53:14,285 --> 00:53:15,945
Do not! Do not!

456
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:38,879
Sorry, kid.

457
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:46,169
Kill him.

458
00:53:51,493 --> 00:53:52,798
Louis.

459
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:55,590
Kill him. Is the end.

460
00:54:50,735 --> 00:54:52,669
He never felt guilty?

461
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,629
What for?

462
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,682
To those killed.

463
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:02,694
Do not.

464
00:55:07,317 --> 00:55:08,815
Instead, I would not.

465
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:13,217
I will not ask. - We do not have too many bandages.

466
00:55:16,602 --> 00:55:17,807
Mr.

467
00:55:17,808 --> 00:55:20,951
I'll do what I want with my body.

468
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,319
If you do not shoot them, they will shoot.

469
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:41,686
We had nothing in common.

470
00:55:44,033 --> 00:55:45,984
I do not feel guilty.

471
00:55:47,586 --> 00:55:49,557
There is no reason to feel guilty.

472
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,685
We have to go. - What is?

473
00:55:59,686 --> 00:56:00,932
Germans.

474
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:17,418
Germans came to the farm. - Where is Vera?

475
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,258
I dont know. It has not been returned.

476
00:56:20,082 --> 00:56:23,443
Go back and look for Vera and Bruno.

477
00:56:23,444 --> 00:56:25,623
You will not make the sucker, okay?

478
00:56:25,624 --> 00:56:26,693
Yes sir.

479
00:56:59,876 --> 00:57:00,999
Lieutenant!

480
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:05,060
<I> Down! </ I>

481
00:57:23,485 --> 00:57:26,395
I did what you asked me.

482
00:57:26,396 --> 00:57:28,739
You know what I do for liars?

483
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:30,428
Or traitors?

484
00:57:31,301 --> 00:57:33,967
Please. I tried to help.

485
00:57:33,968 --> 00:57:36,870
Please help us? Where are the Americans?

486
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:39,541
Where is my officer?

487
00:57:40,464 --> 00:57:43,170
I dont know. - Exactly. You do not know.

488
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:50,170
Search the house!

489
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,161
Come on.

490
00:58:07,214 --> 00:58:08,714
Lewis.

491
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:13,186
We have to go.

492
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:15,644
We heard a shot.

493
00:58:16,437 --> 00:58:17,986
Where is Vera?

494
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,267
Currently he killed? - Do not.

495
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:23,144
This was not.

496
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,636
Bruno was killed. - Who is Vera?

497
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:28,820
You have to be in the city, sir.

498
00:58:30,088 --> 00:58:33,135
We will be back. - You're not with them, you escaped.

499
00:58:34,249 --> 00:58:38,904
He communicated with the center. We go to our last.

500
00:58:40,514 --> 00:58:42,357
Lieutenant, come with us!

501
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:46,383
If you come back, you will attract the Germans and will all die.

502
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,028
Come on.

503
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,562
Lewis.

504
00:59:31,305 --> 00:59:33,110
See if safe place.

505
01:00:31,073 --> 01:00:34,042
See if there are any alive. - Yes sir.

506
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:18,326
<I> We ran out of fuel. </ I>

507
01:01:18,327 --> 01:01:20,852
<> Let us know your nearby power. Overs. </ I>

508
01:01:21,874 --> 01:01:24,495
<I> I am the way Charlie. Charlie. Overs. </ I>

509
01:01:25,169 --> 01:01:27,372
<I> Proceed to the station 3. </ i>

510
01:01:27,373 --> 01:01:28,883
<I> Red Fox 1. overs. </ I>

511
01:01:28,884 --> 01:01:32,166
<I> Red Fox Red Fox 1. 1. Here Yankee 3. overs. </ I>

512
01:01:34,801 --> 01:01:37,512
<I> Red Fox 1 here Yankee 3. listening; </ I>

513
01:01:42,076 --> 01:01:44,308
<> Tell us your position. Overs. </ I>

514
01:01:45,438 --> 01:01:48,105
We're behind enemy lines, cut our unit.

515
01:01:48,106 --> 01:01:50,145
We coordinated the meeting.

516
01:01:59,493 --> 01:02:01,989
<> Then get ready. Overs. </ I>

517
01:02:02,647 --> 01:02:03,806
What time will become the meeting? Overs.

518
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:07,127
<I> At 16:00. Owerri. </ I>

519
01:02:07,842 --> 01:02:09,162
Got there.

520
01:02:09,823 --> 01:02:12,125
Red Fox 1, what will I do when I get there?

521
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:16,882
<I> enough coordinates! </ I>

522
01:02:16,883 --> 01:02:19,205
Please send me a beer, Bill. Overs.

523
01:02:20,527 --> 01:02:23,690
Received. - Received, ending the conversation.

524
01:02:33,064 --> 01:02:34,863
What the hell's going on there?

525
01:02:34,864 --> 01:02:36,178
Germans are coming!

526
01:02:49,345 --> 01:02:50,622
How ...

527
01:02:54,689 --> 01:02:56,140
Close your ears, soldier.

528
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:27,204
Where is Nancy?

529
01:03:30,742 --> 01:03:32,197
Take your gift, you imbecile!

530
01:05:25,905 --> 01:05:27,910
Should I pass you.

531
01:05:42,597 --> 01:05:44,534
But not yet.

532
01:06:06,834 --> 01:06:08,358
We are here.

533
01:06:09,844 --> 01:06:11,279
The Germans are here.

534
01:06:12,196 --> 01:06:17,204
The point is somewhere here within a radius of 16 km.

535
01:06:17,654 --> 01:06:20,083
You talk as if we can get out of here.

536
01:06:29,915 --> 01:06:31,551
Good morning my friends.

537
01:06:36,328 --> 01:06:37,626
Nancy.

538
01:06:49,933 --> 01:06:53,115
The captain, who seemed surprised to see me.

539
01:06:58,221 --> 01:06:59,702
Cigarette?

540
01:06:59,703 --> 01:07:00,746
Do not.

541
01:07:03,472 --> 01:07:06,471
Unfortunately, this visit is not just a social visit.

542
01:07:09,722 --> 01:07:11,874
We give you a place to stay and eat,

543
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:15,833
But first, you have to do something for us.

544
01:07:18,476 --> 01:07:20,579
Captain Becket, please.

545
01:07:21,394 --> 01:07:24,180
No need to get tired.

546
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:36,579
Nancy.

547
01:07:38,556 --> 01:07:40,552
I'm sorry for Vera.

548
01:07:42,214 --> 01:07:43,718
What do you mean?

549
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:47,626
Why sad?

550
01:07:48,262 --> 01:07:53,545
Dietrich Why be sad? Tell me, damn it!

551
01:08:15,832 --> 01:08:18,101
They killed Vera. - Do not say it again!

552
01:08:20,134 --> 01:08:23,636
We do not know who they are. - My fault.

553
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:26,908
Why do you say that?

554
01:08:26,909 --> 01:08:29,744
If I had been in place.

555
01:08:30,433 --> 01:08:31,834
That would be here now.

556
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:36,482
The captain was right ...

557
01:08:36,483 --> 01:08:39,757
I do not know what happened there. - It is not fair that I did my job.

558
01:08:40,939 --> 01:08:42,337
Otherwise my job properly.

559
01:08:44,565 --> 01:08:46,195
This can happen to anyone, guy.

560
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,745
You understand?

561
01:08:49,651 --> 01:08:52,546
No soldier should feel guilty when he kills.

562
01:09:36,841 --> 01:09:39,766
How not to get sick when you look at me like that?

563
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,865
Take my son.

564
01:09:51,369 --> 01:09:53,007
Bring it immediately!

565
01:09:54,597 --> 01:09:55,915
It's okay.

566
01:09:57,052 --> 01:09:58,589
It's ok, I'll do it.

567
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:02,590
I want to see him. We have to see it.

568
01:10:06,718 --> 01:10:10,230
Calm down. I'll get him.

569
01:10:14,728 --> 01:10:16,082
Tell ...

570
01:10:29,557 --> 01:10:31,027
Who we are?

571
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,241
Who we are?

572
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:39,359
I'm sorry.

573
01:10:48,347 --> 01:10:50,572
She cried Vera, does me good ...

574
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:53,368
Vera is not here, sir.

575
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:13,465
This man needs medication.

576
01:11:15,034 --> 01:11:18,729
We are prisoners of war and we are obliged to give medical care.

577
01:11:22,781 --> 01:11:24,684
I understand what I said?

578
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:26,954
Where's Dietrich?

579
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:43,044
<I> What is it? You have 6 cards. </ I>

580
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:45,431
<I> Yes. You have 6 cards. </ I>

581
01:11:45,432 --> 01:11:47,434
<I> By deception, you have six cards. </ I>

582
01:11:49,234 --> 01:11:51,612
<I> has six leaves, motherfucker! </ I>

583
01:11:51,613 --> 01:11:53,907
<I> has six leaves, motherfucker! </ I>

584
01:11:53,908 --> 01:11:55,675
<I> You have six cards! </ I>

585
01:11:55,677 --> 01:11:57,530
<I> 6 malakismeno leaves! </ I>

586
01:11:57,531 --> 01:12:00,541
<I> What is going on here? - The kolopaido, playing with five cards </ I>

587
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:05,570
My Commander.

588
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:10,857
<I> Yes. </ I>

589
01:12:11,983 --> 01:12:13,380
<I> Bring me the girl. </ I>

590
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:41,481
Look at the people around you.

591
01:12:43,208 --> 01:12:44,753
They are soldiers.

592
01:12:46,423 --> 01:12:49,230
They left their home, and they came in a foreign country,

593
01:12:49,613 --> 01:12:51,139
for one reason.

594
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:54,422
To defend.

595
01:12:55,976 --> 01:13:00,280
Limit the Führer in Berlin ... Without anyone to do anything.

596
01:13:00,529 --> 01:13:03,534
In this village, however, the struggle continues.

597
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:06,632
This people ...

598
01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:10,973
These soldiers ...

599
01:13:14,179 --> 01:13:15,849
Worth seeing blood.

600
01:13:22,985 --> 01:13:24,201
Okay ...

601
01:13:24,202 --> 01:13:27,705
What all of you fight?

602
01:13:28,476 --> 01:13:29,922
What do you think?

603
01:13:29,923 --> 01:13:31,860
I do not fight with skatokefalous.

604
01:13:35,868 --> 01:13:37,410
And you?

605
01:13:39,217 --> 01:13:40,560
Lewis soldier.

606
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:43,836
You want to fight for your country?

607
01:14:01,294 --> 01:14:02,829
Wait, dammit!

608
01:14:05,334 --> 01:14:06,629
Dammit!

609
01:14:08,094 --> 01:14:10,317
I will fight too!

610
01:14:13,856 --> 01:14:15,395
I will fight!

611
01:14:20,201 --> 01:14:23,545
Get out there, Nancy! - It's enough! I will fight too!

612
01:14:28,963 --> 01:14:30,755
Get out there, Nancy!

613
01:14:45,035 --> 01:14:46,284
<I> Begin! </ I>

614
01:14:48,861 --> 01:14:50,539
Bastard!

615
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,486
Mad?

616
01:15:04,681 --> 01:15:06,843
Do you want revenge?

617
01:15:11,468 --> 01:15:12,851
Then he fought.

618
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:19,499
Come on, Lewis.

619
01:15:31,847 --> 01:15:33,135
Come on, Lewis.

620
01:15:35,525 --> 01:15:36,860
Come on, Louis!

621
01:15:36,861 --> 01:15:38,132
You can!

622
01:15:38,946 --> 01:15:40,282
Come on, boy.

623
01:15:41,255 --> 01:15:42,545
Is that.

624
01:15:46,533 --> 01:15:47,802
Get up!

625
01:15:47,803 --> 01:15:49,531
Stand up!

626
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,321
Faton Lewis.

627
01:16:19,322 --> 01:16:22,239
The Orma. Faton, Lewis!

628
01:16:24,821 --> 01:16:26,039
Faton!

629
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,656
Fight!

630
01:16:30,981 --> 01:16:32,541
Beat him up!

631
01:16:51,367 --> 01:16:53,269
Lewis, covering his face.

632
01:16:53,623 --> 01:16:54,876
Learn clinging!

633
01:16:54,877 --> 01:16:56,828
Lewis, do not get up!

634
01:16:57,038 --> 01:16:58,296
Lewis, covering his face.

635
01:17:10,048 --> 01:17:11,380
She left him.

636
01:17:24,716 --> 01:17:26,065
See?

637
01:17:26,829 --> 01:17:29,223
Finally I am very magnanimous.

638
01:17:53,863 --> 01:17:56,706
If we stay here, we'll all die.

639
01:18:01,332 --> 01:18:03,978
It's easy to get out of this cage.

640
01:18:05,876 --> 01:18:08,689
Really? So what we do?

641
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:11,614
I dont know.

642
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:27,991
Well are you?

643
01:18:32,028 --> 01:18:33,716
It hurts the jaw.

644
01:18:40,304 --> 01:18:42,733
They kill us, right? - Do not.

645
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:48,350
I heard you talking. - I just prayed for mercy.

646
01:18:57,037 --> 01:19:00,222
I remember my mother the day I left.

647
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:05,044
Chosen one.

648
01:19:07,561 --> 01:19:10,517
You have no idea how much I cried.

649
01:19:12,511 --> 01:19:14,241
I feel.

650
01:19:14,242 --> 01:19:17,402
I never heard someone crying so.

651
01:19:17,403 --> 01:19:19,245
He had been out of control.

652
01:19:33,483 --> 01:19:35,367
I confessed enough.

653
01:19:36,327 --> 01:19:37,830
I'm sorry.

654
01:19:40,884 --> 01:19:42,402
Does not matter.

655
01:19:52,175 --> 01:19:54,332
You will meet again with his mother, Nancy.

656
01:20:10,165 --> 01:20:11,947
You have not slept at all?

657
01:20:16,241 --> 01:20:20,358
Yesterday, they sent me and Maxwell on the lake, only with a guard.

658
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:25,395
I've never talked to my son, soldier?

659
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:28,169
No sir!

660
01:20:32,779 --> 01:20:37,063
He was a good boy. And ferelpis.

661
01:20:39,081 --> 01:20:42,478
He recruited 17.

662
01:20:42,834 --> 01:20:45,569
If I could, I would have gone before.

663
01:20:48,935 --> 01:20:51,780
I always wanted to be like me.

664
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:57,888
My wife said that I send directly to the grave.

665
01:21:01,146 --> 01:21:03,182
Almost got it right.

666
01:21:04,328 --> 01:21:06,422
It was wrong what I did.

667
01:21:13,117 --> 01:21:15,481
I wonder if he knew he would die.

668
01:21:18,546 --> 01:21:20,188
If I was afraid.

669
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,710
I'm sure it would be a good soldier, sir.

670
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:34,962
You know what makes a good soldier?

671
01:21:37,946 --> 01:21:40,956
To learn how to pull the trigger.

672
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:44,876
Humanity.

673
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,206
Sometimes you have to pull the trigger.

674
01:21:51,342 --> 01:21:53,591
But a good soldier never wants to shoot.

675
01:21:57,483 --> 01:21:59,685
So confused.

676
01:22:02,456 --> 01:22:04,206
What to do ...

677
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:10,040
All this will haunt me when you get home.

678
01:22:13,343 --> 01:22:14,627
Mr.

679
01:22:19,486 --> 01:22:22,127
Forget all Lewis.

680
01:22:25,285 --> 01:22:29,832
Go home ... and enjoy your life.

681
01:22:35,936 --> 01:22:38,517
Look is never sad.

682
01:22:42,321 --> 01:22:43,574
Yes sir.

683
01:23:07,394 --> 01:23:08,863
Lewis.

684
01:23:11,806 --> 01:23:13,426
Take, for luck.

685
01:23:14,217 --> 01:23:15,802
I think I need a lighter.

686
01:23:16,934 --> 01:23:18,537
Yes good ...

687
01:23:19,402 --> 01:23:21,669
Hold it for luck.

688
01:23:27,013 --> 01:23:28,322
Are you ready?

689
01:24:14,078 --> 01:24:16,381
Lieutenant!

690
01:24:18,614 --> 01:24:22,302
Are you okay? Lieutenant! Dammit! Hurt. Are you okay?

691
01:24:23,265 --> 01:24:25,876
Probably not. - Damn!

692
01:24:26,668 --> 01:24:29,407
Get out of here, kid. - No. No, I will not leave!

693
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:34,620
It's your only chance. Out of here. Outside. I order.

694
01:24:34,621 --> 01:24:35,841
Outside!

695
01:25:27,073 --> 01:25:28,356
Do not.

696
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:42,843
Flown.

697
01:25:46,046 --> 01:25:47,595
Come on, Nancy.

698
01:25:48,832 --> 01:25:50,167
Come here.

699
01:25:57,341 --> 01:25:58,893
Who was?

700
01:26:00,583 --> 01:26:01,805
The Maxwell.

701
01:28:13,006 --> 01:28:14,938
Lewis is a good soldier.

702
01:28:18,116 --> 01:28:19,669
They can not catch.

703
01:29:22,584 --> 01:29:24,158
How many?

704
01:29:24,586 --> 01:29:26,782
How many you lost? 4, 5 or more multiple?

705
01:29:26,783 --> 01:29:28,165
<I> Move it! </ I>

706
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:32,743
I'm fine. Is nothing.

707
01:29:49,179 --> 01:29:51,104
<I> In the knees! Hurry! </ I>

708
01:29:56,078 --> 01:29:57,136
<I> Bring! </ I>

709
01:30:09,602 --> 01:30:10,753
<I> Go ahead. </ I>

710
01:30:10,754 --> 01:30:12,122
<I> Move it! </ I>

711
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:13,632
<I> Faster! </ I>

712
01:30:20,232 --> 01:30:21,399
<I> America! </ I>

713
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,903
<I> Stop hiding! </ I>

714
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:25,716
Lewis soldier!

715
01:30:33,718 --> 01:30:36,528
It's your last chance.

716
01:30:44,146 --> 01:30:46,525
America is a coward, reveal!

717
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,224
Lewis soldier!

718
01:31:04,174 --> 01:31:05,729
For all that, your fault.

719
01:31:06,622 --> 01:31:09,967
His friends are more prisoners of war.

720
01:31:22,527 --> 01:31:24,422
They are guilty for what you did.

721
01:31:25,192 --> 01:31:26,712
And it is ...

722
01:31:39,176 --> 01:31:40,844
Is the death.

723
01:31:47,109 --> 01:31:48,641
Let them go.

724
01:31:49,895 --> 01:31:53,277
Shoot, but not hurt.

725
01:31:59,121 --> 01:32:00,785
It's not right, damn it!

726
01:32:00,786 --> 01:32:02,282
You know it's not fair!

727
01:32:29,462 --> 01:32:31,177
Last chance!

728
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:35,345
10.

729
01:32:37,814 --> 01:32:39,086
9.

730
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:41,832
8.

731
01:32:46,405 --> 01:32:47,573
7.

732
01:32:50,835 --> 01:32:51,991
6.

733
01:32:58,657 --> 01:32:59,779
5.

734
01:33:04,337 --> 01:33:05,568
Four.

735
01:33:10,243 --> 01:33:11,428
3.

736
01:33:16,816 --> 01:33:18,018
2.

737
01:33:21,854 --> 01:33:23,085
1.

738
01:33:27,466 --> 01:33:28,934
Fire!

739
01:34:24,169 --> 01:34:26,390
Arise, sir. - Save women, Lewis.

740
01:34:27,431 --> 01:34:30,201
I will not leave, sir. - I order you, soldier.

741
01:34:30,202 --> 01:34:31,945
I will not leave, sir.

742
01:34:34,417 --> 01:34:35,964
Where is Maxwell?

743
01:34:37,430 --> 01:34:38,770
The Maxwell, will not come.

744
01:34:41,431 --> 01:34:42,948
We have to go!

745
01:35:11,201 --> 01:35:12,672
Soldier.

746
01:35:18,530 --> 01:35:21,028
The Third Reich, which ordered the immediate execution.

747
01:36:32,065 --> 01:36:33,706
How to get there?

748
01:36:35,634 --> 01:36:36,684
Fine.

749
01:37:09,709 --> 01:37:12,369
Look! This saw?

750
01:37:13,226 --> 01:37:14,480
Yes they are.

751
01:37:16,255 --> 01:37:17,639
Be alert, sir.

752
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:26,286
Well done Lewis!

753
01:37:27,662 --> 01:37:28,955
Well done, my son!

754
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:41,356
We have to go, sir!

755
01:37:41,357 --> 01:37:42,703
Two minutes.

756
01:37:43,563 --> 01:37:45,357
I told them I'm going to wait until 16:00.

757
01:37:46,038 --> 01:37:48,337
Germans! - Comes a jeep to here, sir!

758
01:37:56,599 --> 01:37:58,597
You can see? - I'm trying, sir.

759
01:38:05,207 --> 01:38:07,695
Be ready.

760
01:38:23,185 --> 01:38:24,679
Wait!

761
01:38:27,374 --> 01:38:29,925
They are Americans.

762
01:38:31,374 --> 01:38:40,925
