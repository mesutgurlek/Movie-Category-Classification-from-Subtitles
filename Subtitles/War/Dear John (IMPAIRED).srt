too much...

Yeah, John Tyree.

1234
01:27:35,697 --> 01:27:38,291
Yeah. Yeah,
l'm going to leave soon.

1235

Okay, l'll see you.

SAVANNAH:
Initially after he was diagnosed,
he was so optimistic.

1244
01:28:12,467 --> 01:28:14,833
He wasn't really concerned
about himself, all he cared
about was Alan,

1245
01:28:15,003 --> 01:28:16,937
which was inspiring.

1246
01:28:17,105 --> 01:28:21,599
And it wasn't until after the
cancer spread to stage four
that l noticed a big change.

1247
01:28:23,178 --> 01:28:25,078
JOHN:
What kind of cancer is it?

1248
01:28:25,814 --> 01:28:27,714
SAVANNAH:
Lymphoma.

1249
01:28:29,818 --> 01:28:32,013
SAVANNAH:
He's had it with being
cooped up in that room,

1250
01:28:32,187 --> 01:28:34,621
so he basically just spends
all his time out here.

1251
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:37,054
Sometimes with Alan.

1252
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:43,720
Can l have
a crumble cake?

1253
01:28:43,899 --> 01:28:47,062
Alan, do you
remember John?

1254
01:28:47,235 --> 01:28:48,793
Hello, John.

1255
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:50,335
Hey, Alan.

1256
01:28:50,505 --> 01:28:52,063
He's gotten big.

Good.

1258
01:28:55,777 --> 01:28:56,903
Um...

1259
01:28:58,713 --> 01:29:00,271
l'm going to get him
a crumble cake.

1260
01:29:00,449 --> 01:29:03,111
Oh, that's a good idea.
He's been talking about that.

1261
01:29:03,285 --> 01:29:04,775
Come on, Alan.

1262
01:29:10,459 --> 01:29:12,984
l guess you must want
to kick my ass, huh?

1263
01:29:13,929 --> 01:29:16,397
There's not a lot l can do
about it here, is there?

1264
01:29:20,469 --> 01:29:22,334
it뭩 all part
of my master plan.

1265

1269
01:29:41,756 --> 01:29:44,054
l wanted
to tell you that.

1270
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:47,891
And l'm sorry.

1271

l'm sorry for how it happened
with you so far away.

1272
01:29:54,803 --> 01:30:00,366
But l know now that Alan
will always have someone
to take care of him.

1273
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:05,543
He will always be
in good hands.

1279

the way she used to look at you.

SAVANNAH:
Be careful, Alan.

1282
01:31:01,736 --> 01:31:03,761
He still loves
those horses, huh?

1283
01:31:03,939 --> 01:31:06,373
Yeah, he'll be out
there till bedtime.

1284
01:31:08,243 --> 01:31:10,438
l got to get him
out of that hospital.

1285
01:31:12,247 --> 01:31:14,306
He needs to come home.

1286
01:31:15,483 --> 01:31:20,079
There's a company in Texas
with an experimental drug.

That might help.

1288

But the insurance companies
don't pay for it, of course.

1289
01:31:29,831 --> 01:31:33,028
My parents sold their
beach house a year ago.

1290
01:31:33,201 --> 01:31:35,396
Which was a godsend.

01:32:02,564 --> 01:32:04,327

01:32:04,499 --> 01:32:06,729
Just a glass or two at dinner.

1297
01:32:07,435 --> 01:32:10,404
Tim got me started
a couple years ago.

1298
01:32:18,613 --> 01:32:20,444
Why are you looking at me
like that?

1299

want me to look at you?

You're different.

l don't know why l came here.

We're sitting here and we're
eating and we're talking,

1308
01:32:58,853 --> 01:33:01,014
but no one's actually
saying anything.

What do you want to talk about?

Why didn't you call me?

1312

l mean, did l not deserve
any more explanation than

1313
01:33:27,415 --> 01:33:29,042
that letter?

1314
01:33:30,185 --> 01:33:31,743
You couldn't have
called me?

1315
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:35,481
You couldn't have given me
some sort of chance to,
like, change your mind?

1316
01:33:36,224 --> 01:33:38,385
Don't you think
you owed me that?

l couldn't.

You couldn't?

1319
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:49,431
You thought that little
of me that you couldn't
have just called me.

1320
01:33:50,004 --> 01:33:51,904
Why?

1321
01:33:52,073 --> 01:33:54,405
Because l couldn't.

1322
01:33:55,243 --> 01:33:56,904
Give me an answer.
Why? Why not?

1323
01:33:57,078 --> 01:33:58,773
Because l couldn't.
l want an answer.

1324

l would have changed my mind.

want to hear, John?

all this way to hear from me?

tough out there?

And, what, you think it was
easy for me without you?

to call you.

01:39:36,818 --> 01:39:40,083
JOHN:
This comes up nickel, we're going to
set up right here. We got shade.

1390
01:39:40,254 --> 01:39:43,155
it comes up penny, we'll be up
on the ridge. We got visibility.

1391
01:39:46,227 --> 01:39:49,094
That'd be penny side.
All right, let's go to the ridge.

1392
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,261
SOLDIER:
Sergeant.

1393
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:56,903
JOHN:
Thank you.

1394
01:40:02,009 --> 01:40:03,271
<i>SAVANNAH:
Dear John,</i>

1395
01:40:03,444 --> 01:40:04,877
      

1396
01:40:05,046 --> 01:40:08,072
<i>it's been almost five years
since l wrote a letter with
an actual pen</i>

1397
01:40:08,249 --> 01:40:10,376
<i>on an actual sheet of paper.</i>

1398
01:40:11,486 --> 01:40:13,477
<i>But l thought maybe l could
write you now and tell you</i>

1399
01:40:13,654 --> 01:40:16,316
<i>all that's happened
since l saw you last.</i>

1400
01:40:17,258 --> 01:40:19,192
<i>A few weeks
after you showed up here,</i>

1401
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:22,852
<i>Tim received
an anonymous donation.</i>

1402
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:24,930
<i>A donation that was enough
to give him</i>

1403
01:40:25,099 --> 01:40:27,590
<i>what the insurance
companies wouldn't:</i>

1404
01:40:28,836 --> 01:40:30,303
<i>Time.</i>

1405
01:40:33,407 --> 01:40:36,035
<i>Time to finally come home.</i>

1406
01:40:37,211 --> 01:40:39,975
<i>Time to spend with his son.</i>

1407
01:40:41,682 --> 01:40:43,741
<i>Time to say goodbye.</i>

1408
01:40:46,287 --> 01:40:48,312
<i>The problem with time,
l've learned,</i>

1409
01:40:48,489 --> 01:40:51,947
<i>whether it's those first two weeks
l got to spend with you</i>

1410
01:40:52,126 --> 01:40:55,095
<i>or those final two months
l got to spend with him,</i>

1411
01:40:55,730 --> 01:40:58,358
<i>eventually time always runs out.</i>

1412
01:41:01,602 --> 01:41:04,901
<i>l have no idea where you are
out there in the world, John.</i>

1413
01:41:05,606 --> 01:41:09,372
<i>But l understand that l lost the right
to know these things long ago.</i>

1414
01:41:12,380 --> 01:41:14,871
<i>No matter how many years go by,</i>

1415
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:19,745
<i>l know one thing
to be as true as it ever was.</i>

1416
01:41:22,023 --> 01:41:24,116
<i>l'll see you soon, then.</i>

1417
01:42:01,896 --> 01:42:05,730
      떰

1418
01:44:16,497 --> 01:44:20,490
      

1419
01:46:34,468 --> 01:46:36,459
