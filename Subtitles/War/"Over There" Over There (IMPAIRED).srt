Bo's already your nickname.

459
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,076
- You're kiddin'?
- No.

460
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:41,617
Where I come from,
no one's named Bo. Not at birth.

461
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,949
- Really?
- [Laughing]

462
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:48,048
- What?
- Nothin'. I'm just-

463
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,286
You're a natural leader, Bo.

464
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,529
Just tryin' to figure out why that is.

465
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:01,101
You play quarterback?

466
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,264
People always followed you?

467
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,207
When I was goin'
where they wanted to go too.

468
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,770
- [Mad Cow] You see that kid there?
- [Man] Where?

469
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:14,112
Right there. He dropped something
by the side of the road.

470
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,880
- I see him.
- Well, he dropped something
by the side of the road.

471
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,716
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

472
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,883
A paint can or somethin'.
Pull over!

473
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:24,051
- Pull over where?
- Pull over here, goddamn it!

474
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,980
[Bo Screaming]

475
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,823
[Screaming Continues]

476
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,190
He's breathing.
Circulation, check.

477
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,490
I'll see if we can get
an aircraft in here.

478
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,066
Well, sir, he's losing
time, goddamn it!

479
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,136
[Screaming Continues]

480
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:09,669
That means no goddamn pulse
in his right leg.

481
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,765
No pulse in his right leg.

482
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,844
Give him the morphine!
Give him the goddamn morphine!

483
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,913
I can't. He's gotta be lucid.
This man's in critical danger!

484
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:19,676
He's gonna be in surgery
back at the base in 25 minutes.

485
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,014
Give him something!
They just blew his ass in half!

486
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:26,021
- [Coughing]
- What do I do now?

487
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:30,457
- Get him on the stretcher!
- [Shouting, Indistinct]

488
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,227
[Screaming Continues]

489
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:41,537
- Easy.
- [Screaming]

490
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,038
Get him on the stretcher! Go!

491
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:52,076
[Shouting Continues]

492
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,416
[Slow Rock]

493
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,306
The day is comin'

494
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,777
The drums are drummin'

495
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,978
If you know one
say a prayer

496
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,585
There's mothers cryin'

497
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:40,926
And fathers sighin', uh-huh

498
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,364
War is in the air

499
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,569
The trains are fillin'up
with boys

500
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:01,316
Who've left behind
their favorite toys

501
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:05,878
They're goin'over there

502
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,720
Over there

503
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:16,528
Where someone has to die

504
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:22,465
Over there

505
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:27,135
Over there

506
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:33,112
Where ours
is not to reason why

507
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:38,552
Over there

508
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:42,752
Over there

509
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,094
Where someone has to die

510
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:11,186
