(Swoff)
A story.

2
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:31,934
A man fires a rifle
for many years...

3
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:34,380
and he goes to war.

4
00:00:35,415 --> 00:00:38,384
And afterward,
he turns the rifle in
at the armory...

5
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:41,345
and he believes
he's finished with the rifle.

6
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,558
But no matter what else
he might do with his hands...

7
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:48,756
Iove a woman, build a house...

8
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:52,031
change his son's diaper...

9
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,598
his hands remember the rifle.

10
00:00:55,802 --> 00:01:00,762
(Fitch)
You are no longer black,
or brown, or yellow or red!

11
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:03,509
You are now green!

12
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:07,206
You are light green
or dark green!

13
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,349
Do you understand?

You the maggot whose father
served in Vietnam?

18

Sir, yes, sir!

19
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,793
Outstanding!
Did he have the balls
to die there?

20
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:21,919
Sir, no, sir!

21
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:24,793
Too fucking bad!
He ever talk about it?

22
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:28,557
Sir, only once, sir!
Good! Then he wasn't lying!

23
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:32,566
Are you eyeballing me
with those baby blues?

24
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:34,698
Are you?
Sir, no, sir!

25
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:37,903
Are you in love
with me, Swofford?
Sir, no, sir!

26
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,311
You don't think I look good
in my uniform, Swofford?

27
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:44,509
Sir, the drill sergeant
looks fabulous
in his uniform, sir!

28
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:47,417
So you're gay, then,
and you love me, huh?

29
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:49,182
Sir, I'm not gay, sir!

30
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:52,282
Do you have
a girlfriend, Swofford?
Sir, yes, sir!

31
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,658
Guess again, motherfucker!
Jody's banging her right now!

32
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,594
Get on your face
and give me 25...

she gets fucked this month.

(Swoff)
It was shortly after meeting
Drill Instructor Fitch...

36
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:08,600
that I realized that joining
the Marine Corps...

37
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:10,700
might have been
a bad decision.

38
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:12,938
What in the fuck
is this?

39
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:15,545
Sir,
it's a recruit's drawing
of a footlocker, sir!

Jesus, Joseph
and doggie-style Mary!

That is a pile
of dog shit.

42
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:23,151
Sir, the recruit's
never been good
at drawing, sir!

43
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:25,657
Why the fuck
are you my scribe, then?

44
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:28,057
Isn't my scribe
supposed to know
how to draw?

45
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,322
Sir, the recruit
doesn't know!

46
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,557
The recruit thought
the scribe was supposed
to write, sir!

47
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:33,223
Of course the recruit
doesn't know!

48
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,599
The recruit doesn't know
because I haven't told him!

where your Skivvies
and running shoes go.

51
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:44,538
Sir, the recruit
can't think...

52
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:46,806
while the drill instructor
is hitting him
on his head, sir!

53
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,781
You can't think
while I'm giving you
a few love taps?

54
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,546
How the fuck
are you going to
fire your rifle...

55

when grenades are going off
in your face?

What the fuck
are you even doing here?

So, now my hands
were dick skinners.

00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:16,472
A flashlight was a moonbeam.
A pen was an ink stick.

61
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,410
My mouth was a cum receptacle.

62
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,006
A bed was a rack.
A wall was a bulkhead.

63
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:25,280
A shirt was a blouse.

64
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:28,480
A tie was still a tie,
and a belt a belt.

65

But many other things
would never be the same.

It's English.

My great-grandfather

Oh, yeah.

Good! Parade field, 0600.

All right, thank you,

There's 60 of you.
I only need eight.

That means 52 of you

There's no possible way

I don't have a bugle.

Oh, no. No, no.
Damn, damn.

You better play
with your mouth.

There is no bugle program.

you must see your target,

must not see you.

In order to fire accurately...

233

you must be able to judge
distance and wind direction.

figure that?

and hold that bitch up.

These are formulas
that you can use...

you have to trust your gut.

Good evening.
Iraq invaded and took over...

its tiny neighbor,
Kuwait, today.

325
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:45,339
That set off

Great Britain

at the invitation

630
00:34:42,227 --> 00:34:43,854
You are a Marine.

631
00:34:43,928 --> 00:34:46,522
There's no such thing
as speech that is free.

632
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:48,930
You must pay
for everything that you say.

633
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,695
(cameraman)
We're rolling. Sound, speed.

634
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:55,262
(woman reporter)
You're a Marine
here in Saudi Arabia.

635
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:00,211
Are you glad to be here?

636
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,846
Oh, yes, ma'am,
I'm glad to be here.

637
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:08,352
My uncle and my father
served in Vietnam...

638
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,081
so I'm proud to serve
my country here.

639
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:12,146
I have supreme confidence
in all my leaders...

640
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:14,851
you know, from my team leader
to my President.

641
00:35:15,326 --> 00:35:17,453
I'm very proud
to serve my country, yeah.

642
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:19,156
So, who's waiting
for you back home?

643
00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:23,665
Can I give a message
to my brother?
Sure.

644
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:27,930
Tim, hey. He's gonna get this?
Uh-huh.

645
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:30,001
Tim! What's up?

646
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:33,407
I got your letter, man,
and you are a maniac.

He'll understand that.

You're a Marine
here in Saudi Arabia.

650
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:44,678
How do you hope
the Kuwaitis will greet you?

651
00:35:51,296 --> 00:35:53,321
How do you feel
about the Iraqis?

652
00:35:53,398 --> 00:35:57,266
They're the enemy.
Do you have nightmares
about them?

653
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:58,597

654
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,259
[clearing throat]

655
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:03,607
I love it out here.
This is what I want.

656
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:07,234
'Cause I count for something.

657
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:08,944
Back home...

658
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:12,713
I'd be working some
nowhere job. Nobody would
even know I was alive.

[Laughs]

663
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:31,832
Well, you know,
I have a girlfriend
waiting for me.

664
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:35,972
Anything you'd like
to say to her?

665
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:43,674
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

666
00:36:45,984 --> 00:36:47,212
Hi, Kristina.

667
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,114
Here we are.

668
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:51,585
[Clears throat]

669
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:56,751
Are you scared?

670
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:00,021
Yes, ma'am,
I'm very happy to be here.

671
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,099
I love my country.

672
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:06,333
I miss my parents.
Hey, Mom, hey, Dad.

673
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,067
They're treating me
all right here.

674
00:37:10,575 --> 00:37:13,203
It was an opportunity for me
to defend America...

675
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:18,414
the country which
has given freedom to me
and to my family.

676
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:23,277
And it is an honor
to fight for that freedom.

677
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:24,819
To defend my country...

678
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,821
and to serve my country...

679
00:37:27,892 --> 00:37:30,690
and to learn skills
to eventually
go into law enforcement.

680
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:32,460
Are you scared?

681
00:37:33,798 --> 00:37:34,924
Look...

682
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:38,725
I'm 20 years old...

683
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:41,033
and I was dumb enough
to sign a contract.

684
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:44,237
I can hear
their fucking bombs already.

685
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:48,638
I can hear their bombs.

686
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:51,179
And I'm fucking scared, yeah.

687
00:37:54,485 --> 00:37:57,215
Don't tell my Staff Sergeant,
though, all right?

688
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:00,753
(woman reporter)
So in case
of a chemical attack...

689
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:03,225
what provisions
do your men have for that?

690
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:06,790
This is what we call
the NBC suits.

691
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:09,560
That's nuclear-biological
- chemical protective suits.

692
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:12,125
We also have a mask.
This is the M17 A1 mask...

693
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:13,761
which is fitted
with a drinking tube...

694
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:15,999
so these guys
can drink from
their canteens...

695
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:17,336
without taking off
their masks.

696
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:18,705
Oh, really?
Want to try it?

697
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:21,768
No, thanks, but can I hold it?
Yeah, sure.

698
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,642
It's heavy.
Yeah, it is.

699
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:25,979
But you know, we need these
in order to protect us.

700
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,711
They fight with all this
in all this heat?

701
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:30,083
Yes, they do.
They fight with it and...

702
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:33,419
As a matter of fact,
let me give you
a small demonstration of that.

703
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:37,084
Kruger, get rid of the ball.

704
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,018
Get rid of the ball.

705
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:41,365

of the fucking ball.

00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:44,233

708
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,100
All right, listen up, guys,
today is your lucky day.

709
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:52,199
These reporters want to see
how your NBC suits work.

710
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,543
All right, so we're gonna
continue this little

you won't be needing
your parkas, will you?

Welcome home, Staff Sergeant.

You mind if I sit down
in your bus?

Every war is different.

1726

Ooh-rah.

Give me one shot...

1730
01:51:18,018 --> 01:51:19,315
Hey, where you going?

1731
01:51:37,671 --> 01:51:38,763
Yeah?

1732
01:51:40,507 --> 01:51:42,099
Fergus?
Hey, man.

1733
01:51:44,244 --> 01:51:46,474
Hey, man, how you doing?
Nice haircut.

1734
01:51:46,546 --> 01:51:48,514
Good, thanks.
Come on in.

I got some bad news, man.

A story.

1738
01:52:50,877 --> 01:52:53,402
A man fires a rifle
for many years...

1739
01:52:54,014 --> 01:52:55,743
and he goes to war.

1740
01:52:57,117 --> 01:52:59,347
And afterwards
he comes home...

1741
01:53:00,120 --> 01:53:03,351
and he sees that
whatever else he might do
with his life...

1742
01:53:04,658 --> 01:53:06,250
build a house...

1743
01:53:07,561 --> 01:53:09,085
Iove a woman...

1744
01:53:10,363 --> 01:53:12,388
change his son's diaper...

1745
01:53:14,167 --> 01:53:16,135
he will always remain...

1746
01:53:17,437 --> 01:53:18,768
a jarhead.

1747
01:53:22,309 --> 01:53:24,209
And all the jarheads...

1748
01:53:25,545 --> 01:53:27,979
killing and dying...

1749
01:53:29,583 --> 01:53:32,177
they will always...

1750
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:34,680
be me.

1751
01:53:40,827 --> 01:53:42,351
We are still...

1752
01:53:43,363 --> 01:53:44,853
in the desert.
