And now the news.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,350
The High Command of the
German Armed Forces

4
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:21,760
has issued the
following communique.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,320
At the Cassino Front, the German Tank
Core victoriously counter attacked

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
futile attempts by the enemy
to break the line of defence.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,360
The enemy is now using Negro troops
and other armed coloured people

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,880
in their vain attempts
to advance.

End of communique.

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,760
From neutral,
Stockholm and Lisbon sources

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,400
it has been learned that the Allies
are becoming increasingly divided.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,520
The Americans have accused
the English of starving Europe.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,120
And Churchill has been accused
by British leaders as becoming

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,800
a slave of Wall Street
and Jewish financial interests.

We inform our listeners that
the curfew falls at 19 hours.

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,360
And beginning tomorrow the daily
bread rations will be cut

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,400
from 150 grams
to 100 grams per person.

Ah, va fan...

21
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,840
Here is where you should
start feeling fear.

22
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,600
No matter how carefully you cut
the dust away, inevitably you

23
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,240
remove some of the painting with it,
destroyed by the edge of your knife.

24
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,120
And the loss of even the most
infinitesimal part of a true work
of art must make you panic.

25
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,440
So, tremble as much as you like,

26
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,960
but when you are ready cut
decisively, sure of every stroke.

The Father General is here
with the gentlemen.

28
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,600
Good morning. Good morning,
Father Antonelli. Morning.

29
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,120
Father Antonelli,
there seems to have been a
regrettable misunderstanding.

30
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,160
- Our friends...
-  May I? My dear Professor.

31
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,360
Weren't you responsible for the
work on Masaccio's crucifixion

32
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,080
which was restored here
at the Institute last year?

33
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,160
- Two years ago.
- Two years ago.

34
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,920
It was displayed last month at
the Staatliche Museum in Berlin.

35
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,680
Oh, I didn't know.
Unfortunately something rather
disagreeable has occurred.

36
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,840
One of our experts, one of the very
best men we have in Germany seems

37
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,080
to be on the opinion you understand,
that it was, er...

38
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,420
- Fake.
-  Strange.

39
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,560
A very good one to be sure but
of slightly more recent vintage.

40
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,440
The panel itself is 15th Century,

41
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,480
early 15th Century according
to the experts when Masaccio
was in Florence.

42
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,440
But chromatographic analysis of the
paint has revealed that this Masaccio

43
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,360
was painted a little
less than two years ago.

44
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,920
Father Antonelli, do you paint?

45
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,800
May I know the name of this expert?

46
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,400
Seiglau Stuttgart,
you know him of course.

47
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,280
Only by name. One of the greatest
art forgers in Europe.

48
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,480
Then we may safely assume that he
is an authority on the subject.

49
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,720
My business
is restoring works of art.

50
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,080
It wouldn't be the first time I
have heard of an original denounced

51
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,120
as a forgery,
or a forgery taken for an original.

52
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,640
Let us simply say
an error was made on the part
of whoever sent the painting.

53
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,040
He mistook the copy for the
original. I sent the painting.

54
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,680
I packed it myself when I was
ordered to ship it to Germany.

55
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,600
Then nothing would be easier
than for you to prove
it's authenticity or not.

56
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,400
I fervently hope so.

57
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,200
And the people of Germany have
taken Masaccio to their heart.

58
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,160
It would be cruel to disillusion
them, would it not, Father?

59
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,000
Of course. You will, erm,

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you will look into it immediately,
will you not, Father?

61
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,680
It was a mistake. Yes. And
every man is entitled to a mistake.

62
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,160
- One mistake.
- I shall do everything possible.

63
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,200
The impossible too let us hope.

64
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,800
The church has always thrived
on doing the impossible.

What would you do in mine?

00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,160
- I'd have you shot.
- Not before I'd talked.

Good evening, Father General.

But you are aware of the mission

the lesser of two evils.

Are you asking me,
or is this an order?

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,960
An order, Father Antonelli.

98
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,480
An order.

Should we barricade ourselves

inside the institute and say, "Come,
get it if you have the courage."

If everybody were ready to
resist that way, I'd say yes.

The trouble is the people are
exhausted and disillusioned.

20 years of dictatorship.

The Duce says that he's
the most hated man in Italy.

113
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,440
Hated and feared.

114

And as we say in Italy,
the Duce's always right.

In that event Your Excellency,
I'm glad to hear we're not the
only ones the Italians hate.

Ah, Police Chief Caruso,

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,720
Kappler, His Excellency is most
unhappy because of the difficulties

118
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,840
you have raised about the
celebrations for tomorrow, the...

119

The 25th anniversary of
the founding of the Fascist party.

120
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,600
On the contrary, I've raised
no difficulties whatsoever.

121
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,040
Providing that the
festivities were held behind

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,800
- closed doors.
- Which means YOU have

123
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,840
prevented the members of our new
Fascist Republican party
from parading through Rome.

124
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,360
I did nothing of the sort.

125
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,280
I simply pointed out to the
Head of your party that
this seemed hardly the time

126
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,840
to provoke the citizens of Rome
with a demonstration which they would
find unpopular to say the least.

127
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,720
Such talk is inadmissible, Colonel.

128
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,400
All Colonel Kappler meant
is he doesn't consider

129
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,320
that a public demonstration
in Rome could come
of without incidents.

130
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,520
Our men will safeguard
law and order.

131
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,640
Then who would be left
to do the parading.

132
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,440
Would your Excellency be kind
enough to listen to a list of raids
and sabotage acts committed in

133
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,040

Armed Forces and our fascist allies?

We're aware there are
some criminal elements.

135
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,840
Yes, yes. They're ingenious,
audacious and well organised,

136
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,600
and they have a strategy, we know.

137
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,160
What strategy?

138
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,120
Block our supply lines.

139
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,000
Turn Rome into hostile territory
and make us withdraw. Communists.

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,280
Communists, Socialists,
Anarchists, Christian Democrats,
Liberals and Monarchists.

141
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,480
Monarchists?

142
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,520
Monarchy is dead.

143
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,160
They will not dare attack
a military formation.

144
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,480
Besides they are divided gangs.

145
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,600
Colonel Dollmann and I have good
reason to believe the contrary.

146
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,640
There exists a military council
with representatives

147
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,680
from every political party with
the exception of yours, of course.

148
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,960
We're talking about a parade,
Your Excellency, there are no
military formations in Rome.

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,640
Rome is politically neutral.

150
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,800
Rome is swarming with German troops.

151
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,200
Tanks and whole divisions pass
under the Pope's window every day
on the way to the front.

152

00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,920
May He be praised forever.

464
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,360
He is roaring.

465
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,200
He is roaring, roaring.

466
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,920
I called Berlin,
Jodl spoke to him personally.

467
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,640
They're trying to get me Kesselring.

468
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,880
Then get me Mackensen.

469
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,520
General Mackensen, idiot.

470
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,000
He wants to blow up the whole block.

471
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,240
House by house. It's as I said.

472
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,160
He wants 50 to 1.

473
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:40,160
50 Italians for every 1 of our dead.
He will reconsider.

474
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,520
This is a political matter.

475
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,600
Rome is not the Eastern Front.
He will reconsider.

476
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:53,200
Besides, this time for a change,
WE are not the wild animals.

477
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,020
Animals? We?
[ PHONE BEEPS ]

478
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,440
General Mackensen. How...

479
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,480
Oh, you've heard? Yes.

480
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,520
Yes, one moment, Kappler is here.

481
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:08,880
How many dead? As of now, 28.

482
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,240
28. But there will be more.

483
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,800
General, I have recommended
and the Fuhrer himself...

484
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,880
Oh, you know.

485
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,120
Excessive? But the Fuhrer...

486
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,440
Reconsider?

487
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,320
He wants to speak with you.

488
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,600
Yes, General.

489
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,760
Yes, I want to discuss the
matter with General Harster.

490
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,120
We agree that if reprisals
were called for,

491
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,680
all our male prisoners
under sentence of death

492
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,040
and those serving life terms would
be considered candidates.

493
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,200
Yes, sir, if necessary we would
include all those accused of crimes

494
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,760
punishable by death but
not yet tried in a court.

495
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,440
Yes, sir, they would be
taken from our prisons
here in Rome and executed.

496
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,680
Very good, sir. Thank you, sir.

497
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,600
I hadn't finished speaking.

498
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,080
He hung up on me, sir.

499
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,360
Well, what did he say?
How many to one?

500
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,840
He said that you would be
informed when the measures to
be taken had been decided on.

501
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,880
I don't understand you.

502
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:23,520
Our men are lying in that stinking
street, torn apart by Italian pigs

503
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,280
and you seem to want to forget
about the whole affair.

504
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,560
We didn't ask to come
to this filthy place.

505
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,800
We came to help,
invited by our allies.

506
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,840
You would see them go unpunished?

507
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,760
The Romans must be discouraged
from illegal acts but

508
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,080
reprisals never stopped anyone,
General.

509
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,840
One of the chief causes
of the First World War and made
martyrs out of the Czechs at Lidice.

510
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,320
Reprisals, General,

511
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,920
punish nobody except the victims
and their...executioners.

512
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,000
So, now you're giving
me history lessons.

513
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,920
They will stop the Italians.

514
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,000
They scare easily.

515
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,840
You, you have another plan.

516
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,800
Well, let's say, I have an opinion.

517
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,680
To hell with your opinions.

518
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,200
- You will do as I tell you.
-  No, sir.

519
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,520
What?

520
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,880
I will do what you are
ordered to tell me to do.

521
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,200
Field Marshal Kesselring, General
Maelzer has telephoned four times.

522
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,080
- He says it's urgent.
- Not now.

523
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,880
The congestion at the
front is now at an end.

524
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,280
The Americans are in a
position to move north.

525
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,240
I don't think we can hold out
much more than a couple of months.

526
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,840
We shall therefore continue to
prepare our withdrawal from Rome.

527
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,320
Sir, General Maelzer has rung again.

528
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,920
He says that the partisans
attacked a detachment of SS
in the centre of the city.

529
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,880
And that there have
been heavy losses.

530
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,080
I see. Thank you.

531
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,720
Shall I call him back?

532
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,920
No, call Berlin, High Command.

533
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,120
Well, Colonel,
what was your impression of what
we saw at the front today?

534
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,760
I like the chance of playing the
Americans' hand, if only for a day.

535
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,840
I'd walk all over you with the
arms and equipment they've got
down there. General Jodl, sir.

536
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,280
Kesselring speaking.

537
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,920
I see.

538
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,600
Yes.

539
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,160
What do you expect, 30 dead?

540
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,720
I lost 400 today alone.

541
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,200
But Rome is the front too.

542
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,120
If he's gonna stick to that decision,
he must send me everything himself.

543
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,760
I cannot spare one
fighting man, one truck.

544
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,360
Ask him to reconsider.

545
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,370
Yes, that is my answer.
I await yours.

546
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:30,395
[RADIO]: In Rome,

547
00:50:30,456 --> 00:50:35,200
the 25th anniversary of the
founding of fascism was gloriously

548
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,280
commemorated by imposing ceremonies
at the Ministry of Corporations.

549
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,960
The event organised by the
Fascist Republican Party,

550
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,120
has as it's guest speaker,

551
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,160
the great blind poet and hero of
the Albanian war.

552
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,280
Carlo Borsani, now Under Secretary.

553
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,480
Borsani recalling the historic
events of March 23rd, Fascism's

554
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,160
most sacred day, said that
the glorious Fascist experience...

555
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,080
Just isn't possible. Not one word.

556
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:09,760
..that in their misfortunes
they don't despair.

557
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,040
I thought a nice bowl of hot soup.

558
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,760
- Thank you, Giovanni.
-  But no bread.

559
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,200
Doesn't matter. There are
plenty of blankets in the cupboard.

560
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,880
If you don't need me for anything...

561
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,480
A Vatican spokesman
has disclosed that the Holy Father
is enjoying perfect health.

562
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,320
He suffers only from the anguish
brought on by the war,

563
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,120
with it's privation, sorrow
and the destruction...

564
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,920
Father,
try to understand why we did it.

565
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,440
I can't.

566
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,560
I'm sorry but I can't.

567
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:52,000
..German assault operation.
At Anzio enemy losses were

568
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,760
reported to be much more severe than
those of the German Armed Forces.

569
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:04,400
Reports from Tokyo disclose that
Japanese Forces are advancing
victoriously in Indian territory...

570
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,160
Nobody's mentioned it yet.

571
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,840
We wait for the BBC.

572
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,440
I wonder what the Allies
will make of it.

573
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,200
Also, our king.

574
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,520
This committee is operating
under Allied directives.

575
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,360
Our king thinks we ought to sit
tight and wait for his return.

576
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,320
But you know the Hague Convention
provides for reprisals.

577
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,880
Listen, Andrea,

578
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,600
a state of war exists
between Italy and Germany.

579
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,000
We attacked an enemy formation,
full battle dress

580
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,720
in broad daylight,
on our own territory.

581
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,400
I'd like to know what
the Germans are thinking.

582
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,160
If they follow the rules
of the Hague Convention,

583
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,640
they'll say that if the people
responsible don't come forward,

584
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,160
they'll execute hostages.

585
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,000
Even two or three times the number
of German soldiers killed.

586
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,200
They wouldn't risk it.
They know Rome would explode.

587
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,760
Let's get one thing straight.

588
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,440
Whatever happens,
none of our men comes forward.

589
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,400
- No-one.
- But innocent people...

590
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,480
Innocent people were living
in worse in Rotterdam,
in London, in Leningrad.

591
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,480
And innocent people,
millions of Jews are being
exterminated in the gas chambers.

592
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,960
Do you seriously believe
that Rome alone is immune,
because of the Pope?

593
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,080
I won't accept that.

594
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,800
And neither will millions
of other Italians.

595
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:29,960
You say that Germans will
take reprisals, shoot hostages.

596
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,960
Let them try.

597
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:34,632
We'll make the whole of
Rome rise against them.

598
00:53:34,693 --> 00:53:35,760
He's right.

599
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,000
I have children,

600
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,560
one day I want them to say,

601
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,520
"My father chose to drown in blood

602
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,920
"rather than live in shit."

603
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,520
I know you've been calling
for hours, General Maelzer,

604
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,960
but please try to calm yourself.

605
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,520
I understand how you feel.

606
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,680
Perhaps you've lost
the habit of seeing blood.

607
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:07,360
From now on, we must all get
used to the idea that the
partisans are an army too.

608
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:10,080
Now listen carefully,

609
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,960
I've spoken to Berlin several times.

610
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,640
The matter has been thought out
more carefully.

611
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,000
Your orders have been
dispatched to you by teletype.

612
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,520
They are to be
carried out accordingly.

613
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,560
These are not my orders, gentlemen.

614
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:54,240
Not the Chief of Staff's
and not from the High Commander.

615
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,800
What I have here, my friends,

616
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,320
is an order from the Fuhrer himself.

617
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,400
The Fuhrer has reconsidered,
Kappler.

618
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,600
Field Marshal Kesselring argued
the case that the measures
proposed were excessive.

619
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,160
I think we can all be proud
that the Field Marshal succeeded

620
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,440
in making an honest and generous
effort to exercise humanity.

621
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,520
50 to 1 is hardly the same
as 10 to 1.

622
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:30,360
It is the Fuhrer's expressed wish
that the entire operation
is completed in 24 hours.

623
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,840
The official order
was despatched at 1910.

624
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,240
It is now a few minutes to midnight.
That means we have...

625
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,840
19 hours and 10 minutes, sir.
May I see that teletype?

626
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,520
32 of our men are dead.

627
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,440
That means 320 Italians.

628
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,520
Kappler, you will make up the list.

629
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,480
This order, sir, calls for those
condemned to death and those
accused of serious crimes,

630
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:57,320
we may not hold enough prisoners
sufficient to complete the quota.

631
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,960
I'll leave that for you to resolve.

632
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,080
You're the best judge.
Caruso will help you.

633
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,600
Caruso, you will furnish
Kappler with 80 names.

634
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,040
More, if he needs them. 80?

635
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,800
General, that's impossible.

636
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,560
We have only a few.

637

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,800
We have no way of... All right.

639
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,160
Make it 50, for now.

640
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,120
But, General, we need...

641
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,320
Could we have an
official letter for the 50 names?

642
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,960
Coordinate that with Kappler.

643

Schutz, How many men
in the Via Tasso.

644
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:36,520
Sentenced to death?
- Three, sir. - Who?

645
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,840
A communist, a spy and a saboteur.

646
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,880
How many in the Regina Coeli prison?

647
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,080
- None, sir.
- Life sentences?

648
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,400
- None, sir.
- Any kind of sentence?

649
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,480
We have several with
terms ranging from...

650
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:48,208
Several? Now what do
you mean by several?

651
00:56:48,269 --> 00:56:50,460
- 16, sir.
- 16.

652
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,480
3 and 16.

653
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:59,000
We have 3 men sentenced to death
and they want 320. It's impossible.

654

- Priebke?
- Sir?

655
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,960
Contact the President of the Military
Tribunal. Wake him if you have to.

656
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,920
I want written authorisation
for the 3 and the 16.

657

Yes, sir. I want permission
in writing to include

658

for serious offences.

Yes.

662

talk to General Harster.

- Harster?
- Yes, yes, he can help us.

666

He has jurisdiction over a category
I totally overlooked. All right.

to accept responsibility
for those awaiting trial.

the boys would rather get their
hands on the people who did it.

It's nothing to do with us but there
are security aspects involved

702
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,840
and we must examine them
with the utmost attention.

Americans at the gates of the city,
it could be total chaos.

Could be the end.

Could be the end of Rome.

covets another painting?

No, Father, this time I have not
come to take but to give.

01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:10,480
I came at this hour in
the hope of keeping this
particular meeting secret.

710
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,320
I don't see how our meetings
can be kept secret,

711
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,560
the diplomatic mission
the Holy Father has given me

712
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,360
is virtually public knowledge.

713
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:22,640
In any case, what I'm about
to tell you will remain
only between you and me.

714
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,920
You heard what happened
in Via Rasella?

715
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,320
Of course. I have few details.

716
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:32,040
32 German soldiers were killed. 320
Italians are to be shot in reprisal.

717
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,760
The order has come
down from very high.

718
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,840
In my opinion we are about to commit
an error which has to be avoided.

719
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:44,440
Don't misunderstand me, the fate
of 320 Italians matters little to me

720
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,680
compared to the 10 or 15 million
we've already lost in this war.

721
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,040
But we must be prudent.

722
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:57,120
A German reprisal will provoke
public outrage and hatred
of a most violent kind.

Need I tell you that
Rome is a time bomb.

And the partisan movement
is only waiting for a moment
to unite the resistance.

some of the people who live in the
Via Rasella goes without saying.

01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,040
Anyway, we are on a list ourselves,

771
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,520
are we not, Your Excellency?

772
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:05,360
Colonel, I have double checked
with Caruso's office and they say
the list is still incomplete.

773
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,800
Never mind Caruso for the moment.

774
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,160
We have another problem.

775
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:14,160
Burial site.

776
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,640
Dobrich is in charge of
the execution, but where?

777
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,480
It's a security problem.

778
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,560
We must find a suitable place.

779
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,080
Take days to, er...

780
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,720
dig a burial site, a communal grave.

781
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,120
Think in terms of a...

782
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:37,320
grotto, a large

783
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,280
natural death chamber.

784
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,720
Colonel, the priest is here.

785
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,760
Priest? What priest?
Father Antonelli.

786
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,840
What's he want?
He says he must speak to you.

787
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,360
Where is he?

788
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,840
I can only give you
a few minutes, Father.

789
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:00,560
Colonel, I came here because
you have been kind to me.

790
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,320
I would like to know what will
happen now, innocent...

791
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:08,080
It will be a fair reprisal, Father,
carried out according to the
laws of the Hague Convention.

792
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,720
So war has laws too?

793
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,840
Yes, and we will respect them.

794
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:18,920
The law provides for
retaliation against illegal
attacks on our Armed Forces.

795
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,480
They said it was
an act of open warfare.

796
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:23,640
They? Do you know them?

797
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:26,560
How many are there? 2? 3? 5?

798
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,200
- Who are they, Father?
-  Everybody.

799
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,640
It's the only thing people are
talking about all over Rome.
But you haven't said anything.

800
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:38,200
You've given a warning
if the persons responsible do not
come forward we shall shoot.

801
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,920
They are still waiting to hear.

802
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,840
They might give themselves up.

803
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,960
And what would we do with
a handful of assassins?
That's not enough, Father.

804
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:49,000
And you call this a reprisal.

805
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,440
Did you make any effort
to find the attackers?

806
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,200
Did you make a public announcement
warning the people of Rome

807
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,960
what measures would be taken
against them? You did not.

808
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,080
Italy is our ally.

809
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,840
Italy. But what's Italy?
There are two sides now.

810
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,800
And you are on the wrong side.

811
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,160
No, Colonel, this is not a reprisal.

812
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,800
Do not pretend to yourself.

813
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,480
You are not big enough to cover
crime with fancy words.

814
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:16,440
This is human slaughter
by any name.

815
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:21,000
But you haven't even followed
the most mandatory rule of war.

816
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,400
It's too late, Father.

817
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:27,120
Machinery is running by itself.
Then stop the machinery.

818
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,720
The machinery is what you call God, I
cannot stop it any more than I can...

819
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,160
than a bullet can stop
being fired by a gun.

820
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:37,320
I'm a man, alone, weighing
nothing in the scale of things.

821
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:39,080
And you cannot stop it, Father.

822
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,800
That is all.

823
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,160
I'll let the spin
of the wheel decide.

824
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:50,160
God doesn't spin wheels
to decide the fate of man.

Your God died 2000 years ago.

826

This is the list. You have made up
the list of the men who will die.

827
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,280
I can only say that for...

828
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,840
every name that I wrote
I thought three times.

829
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,400
Three times.

830
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,440
Do something, Colonel. Delay.

831
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,240
- Destroy it. Burn it.
- Are you mad?!

832
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:21,560
You see that, Colonel?

01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,680
The eternal symbol of renewal
of hope and change.

834

Many people sleep late.

They miss the dawn,
but it dawns for every man.

836

Many people, Father,
dream when they're awake.

I pity you, Colonel.

838

Don't pity me.

839
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:41,120
Pity the man who has to...
carry out this deed.

840
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:46,280
I'll stop you. Father Pancrazio will
speak to the Pope. We will stop you.

841
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,120
The Pope is...

842
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,840
very heavily burdened. Surely you
don't want to add to his burden.

A telephone from Colonel
Kappler's office, sir.

How many names has he got?
He's finished.

- And he says we are late.
- Late?

855

It's easy to say late.

856
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:04,280
He's going to say,
I had only 50 names.

No. Do you know where Elena lives?

Do you understand?

Everything is a question of life and
death these days, Father Antonelli.

928
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,640
[PHONE RINGS]
Yes. Yes, put him through.

929
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,360
Colonel Hauser.

930
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:26,760
Colonel, you will proceed with the
utmost urgency to place a detachment
of your men at my disposal.

931
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,680
They will proceed with the
execution of 320 hostages.

932
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:34,480
What? You will what?!

933
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,000
Here are the names, sir.
Quite an ordeal.

934
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,142
This is a report on the
execution site and here is...

935
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:51,680
a copy of the plan of the place of execution which
we considered most suitable.

936
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:57,080
Colonel Hauser has refused
to place his men at my disposal.

937
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:01,040
He says it is a job for the SS
and not the army.

938
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:03,840
Well, I would say he's correct, sir.

939
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,400
Kappler, you don't understand.

940
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,160
Doprich has refused.

941
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,720
Hauser has refused.

942
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:12,080
In other words, he washes
his hands of the whole affair.

943
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:16,200
We have only eight hours left.
What good is your list?
Who is going to shoot them?

944
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,720
I shouldn't worry, sir. I'm sure
you'll find somebody to do it.

945
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,360
Yes, you.

946
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,240
You will do it.

947
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,440
That is an official order, sir.

948
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:48,000
I will of course put my men at your
disposal for this...operation.

949
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,520
No, Kappler.

950
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,920
As Commander
of the security forces in Rome,

951
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,120
it is your duty
to set your men an example.

952
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:03,800
You and all your officers
must participate at
least once in this operation.

953
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,000
That is my official order.

954
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,320
And of course,
you shall have it in writing.

955
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,120
You're quite right, sir.

956
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:15,080
I shouldn't ask my men
to do something
I'm not prepared to do myself.

957
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,760
I consider it a symbolic necessity.

958
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:22,680
You're a fine officer, Kappler.

959
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,600
I will mention you in my report
to the Fuhrer.

960
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,720
This could
be very important for you.

961
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,600
Five times I volunteered for
the Eastern Front. Five times.

962
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,240
Five times I was refused.

963
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:42,160
They told me
I'd have an important part to play...

964
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,760
..important part to play in Rome.

965
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:28,880
Gentlemen, you all know why
we're here, so I won't waste
what little time we have left.

966
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:34,120
Captain Priebke to whom I've already
spoken is briefing the men.

967
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,880
I would like to say two
preliminary things, however.

968
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:41,120
First, there is no question
of moral guilt on our part.

969
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,920
We are soldiers obeying
precise orders.

970
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:51,080
Secondly, all 74 of us, officers
and men, all of German nationality
will take part in this operation.

971
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:53,840
Anyone refusing to do so
will face a military tribunal.

972
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,840
I don't need to tell
you what that means.

973
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,720
Like many of you here,

974
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,240
I've never killed a man.

975
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,040
I will fire the first bullet.

976
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:10,720
I'm certain I speak for all
of us here, Colonel,
when I say we will all do our duty.

977
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,680
Thank you gentlemen.

978
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,480
This is the operation site.

979
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:22,440
A series of abandoned man-made caves
about three and a half kilometres
southwest of where we are now.

980
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,680
And at the Via Ardeatina
which is there.

981
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,120
The tunnels are made of limestone.

982
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:31,080
When sealed, they will make
a natural death chamber

983
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,960
and the limestone will accelerate
the decomposition of the remains.

984
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:42,920
The tunnels are already being mined
and will be blown shut
on completion of the operation.

985
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,320
The prisoners will be led in here.

986
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:52,040
The executions will take place
by pistol fire, the Mauser.

987
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:56,280
The prisoners will be shot in
batches of five by platoons of five.

988
01:20:56,280 --> 01:21:00,160
It therefore follows that each of
us here will kill four or five men.

989
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,120
I will now demonstrate
the procedure to be followed.

990
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,080
The prisoner will kneel,
head pushed slightly forward.

991
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:13,040
The muzzle of the gun will be
placed in the nape of the neck.

992
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:16,360
Close, but contact is unnecessary.

993
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:22,520
The bullet will pass from low to
high through the centre of the brain
causing instant and painless death.

994
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,280
Thank you. I calculate three
hours to round up the prisoners.

995
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,640
One hour for transportation to the
caves, one minute for each execution.

996
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:35,040
We should be finished by sundown,
a couple of hours ahead of time,
if all goes...if all goes as planned.

997
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,800
I have already ordered 40 trucks
from the motor pool, but Colonel,
they're making difficulties.

998
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:43,120
What difficulties?
18 of the trucks are normally
used to transport meat supplies.

999
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:46,560
And the officer in charge objects
that if men are carried in them,

1000
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,920
they'll need to be
sterilised afterwards.

1001
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:53,120
Get the trucks!
I will answer to the objections.

1002
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:56,440
Gentlemen, we must not
attract attention at all costs.

1003
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,640
Our best safety is speed.

1004
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:04,120
The hospital just telephoned,
Colonel. Another man has died.

1005
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:11,520
Very well. I shall add ten more names
to the list making it 330 in all.

1006
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,400
Modify your plans accordingly.

1007
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,480
That'll be all.

1008
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:25,280
Priebke, the other evening you were
telling me about ten Jews
living in Arian households.

1009
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,440
I ordered you to arrest them.
Are they in custody?

1010
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,400
At Regina Coeli prison, sir.

1011
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,240
Add them to the list.

1012
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,480
Send over a few cases
of Cognac to the caves.

1013
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,440
Our men will not find it easy.

1014
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:46,600
Yes, sir.

1015
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,680
Please sit down.

1016
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,400
I am sorry you've
had to wait so long.

1017
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,200
Father, please, tell
me what has been done.

1018
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,240
All that was humanly possible,
my son.

1019
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:13,280
Then it wasn't stopped?

1020
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,760
The Holy Father has given
serious consideration

1021
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:21,800
to the possibility
of his intervention,
but the Germans have threatened

1022
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:27,160
to re-examine their attitude
towards the present negotiations
for the salvation of Rome.

1023
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:31,120
Salvation of Rome? What salvation,
Father? Whose salvation?

1024
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:37,200
Father Antonelli, even at a moment
like this, we must never forget

1025
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:42,440
that the Germans are our last
hope against atheist Communism.

1026
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:45,880
Do you mean to tell me the Pope
refused to intervene?

1027
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,960
That he has forgotten
he is the Parish Priest of Rome?

1028
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:53,520
How dare you pass judgement?

1029
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,560
The Holy Father
is a prisoner of history.

1030
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:04,200
He must think and act in
terms that are universal.

1031
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,240
So the church renounces her mission?

1032
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:10,480
The Holy Father's
chosen to do nothing.
We have all chosen to do nothing!

1033
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,400
Please keep calm, Father Antonelli.

1034
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,360
These hours have not passed in vain.

1035
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:22,240
We have drawn up a statement
that will appear on the front page
of the Romano tomorrow. Tomorrow?

1036
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:27,520
Let me read it to you, my son
and then you can judge for yourself.

1037
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:35,160
"In these anxious hours,
we turn our thoughts particularly

1038
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:41,760
"to the city of Rome, so often
tortured by anguish and tribulation.

1039
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:48,480
"Our appeal is made directly to
the conscience of the population
who have so admirably demonstrated

1040
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:52,920
"their spirit of sacrifice
and profound sense of dignity.

1041
01:24:52,920 --> 01:25:00,240
"Do not with violent urges, shatter
this attitude which is so worthy
of the virtues of our people.

1042
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:03,840
"Every ill-considered act
would have no other result

1043
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:10,000
"than to end by injuring many
innocent people,
already tried by anguish.

1044
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
"Maintain public order..."

1045
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,360
Colonel Kappler.

1046
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:48,880
Oh, thank you.

1047
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:57,680
I must see him.

1048
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:02,640
They didn't want to let me in.
You're in. What do you want?
I've just come from the Vatican.

1049
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,920
The Holy Father is taking the
necessary steps. You must postpone.

1050
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:10,120
We've already been informed of the
necessary steps the Holy Father
is prepared to take.

1051
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:13,800
This will appear
in the Vatican newspaper tomorrow.

1052
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,400
"Maintain public order.

1053
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:21,080
"See that is it not disturbed by
any attitude whatsoever that
gives rise to painful conflicts.

1054
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:26,440
"And those who know how to
influence the minds of the citizenry,
above all, the priests,

1055
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:31,040
"have the high mission of persuasion,
pacification and giving comfort."

1056
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,680
So you see, Father, there was no
point in your coming here.

1057
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,120
Colonel, you have a soul.

1058
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:42,360
Give it whatever name you like,
but one day, regardless of what

1059
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:46,720
happens now, you will be called to
account before the tribunal of God.

1060
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:49,600
Do something. There is still time.

1061
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,600
There is no time, Father.

1062
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,760
It was always too late.
I realise that now.

1063
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:59,760
Man acts the way he does,
so does the Pope.

1064
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:05,600
Any man who believes that he
can control his own destiny
is dreaming an ancient dream.

1065
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,960
An ancient dream of fools.

1066
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,720
Fools?

1067
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:12,720
You call us fools. Dreamers.

1068
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,000
You call a massacre a reprisal.

1069
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,600
You call a living, feeling boy a
partisan. A sick old man, hostage.

1070
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,200
You call a woman full of love,
a Communist.

1071
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:27,120
Hangmen wear masks, Colonel, and
you mask yourself with empty words.

1072
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:29,560
You blind yourself in
order to destroy.

1073
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,920
But we are a man, humanity.

No, Father.

Sir, they just telephoned
from Regina Coeli.

1089
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,840
They've already taken them away.

they'd take the guards away instead.

They took 55 prisoners.

1095

That's too many.

1096
