 In the year 2525

You look in the Bible
at the Battle of Jericho.

Joshua is ordered by Yahweh
to slay every man, woman,
child, cattle

and slave of his enemy. That's
how you win a fucking war.

You want the prisoner hung?

72
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,900
That fucking gook murdered five
of my men. I want him hung.

73
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,700
I understand, lieutenant,
but he's still a soldier.

74
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
He's not a soldier.
He's not in uniform.

75
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,600
I want him hung.

is a VC sniper.

He's killed at least five
of our brothers.

[Garraty] All right.

that's murder.

You got a problem with the Army,
or with me, asshole?

I believe I've got
a problem with you, sir.

Good.

[man] You one of the new guys?

97
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,400
How long you been here?

98
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
A while.

99
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,900
- Heard about the tunnels?
- Yeah.

100
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,200
- Ever been in one?
- A few.

101
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,300
Well, shit.
Welcome to the camp.

102
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,800
- Porterson.
- Johnson.

103
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,000
[Porterson] All right.

104
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,400
Thanks.

105
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,500
Johnson, right?

106
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,800
Miller. Bob Miller.

107
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,600
And you are...?

108
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,500
- Porterson.
- Porterson.

109
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Right.

110
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,500
Man, I just cannot
get used to this food.

111
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
My mom's the best cook.

112
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,100
Her brisket
is out of this world.

113
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Every Friday night,
we have the best Shabbat dinner.

114
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Me, her, the entire
neighborhood.

115
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,700
I can't wait to get back.

116
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,000
She's sick, my mom.

117
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,400
Every week I'm away, it breaks
her heart more and more.

118
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,300
If I lose her
before I get back...

119
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,800
- Gary, right?
- Yeah.

120
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Miller.

121
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,200
People like Miller
got no business being here.

122
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,000
- I know.
- Blabbermouths.

123
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,300
Nothing they say
is ever worth hearing.

124
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,900
Talking too much out here
can get you hurt, get other
people killed.

125
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Take a look at them,
for example.

126
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Battle-hardened vets, they come
in, eat their chow and leave.

127
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,600
Then you got enlisted types who
think this is a fucking game.

128
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Then there's guys like Miller.

129
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,800
Future KIA.

130
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,900
Someone who talks a lot because
he's scared shitless to be here.

131
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,800
Well, I hope this
makes you feel better.

132
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,100
[grunting]

133
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
You wanna play God,
you son of a bitch?

134
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,800
Is that what you
wanna do, play God?

135
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,000
Ah!

136
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,200
It ain't about God or the devil,
Harris. It's about survival.

137
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
All right.

138
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,200
[grunting]

139
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,200
Charlie's gonna kill you
just for fucking being here.

140
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
He doesn't care
if you're a nice guy.

141
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,000
[groaning]

142
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,700
[indistinct chatter]

143
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,100
Same old shit.

144
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,000
Verano, come here.

145
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,200
- Sarge?
- What's wrong with the food?

146
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
Just tastes bad, sergeant.

147
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,400
I know. Where you from?

148
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,800
- Michigan.
- Yeah?

149
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,700
My wife's folks have a place in
Charlevoix. Know where that is?

150
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,600
- Yeah. Really?
- It's around the lake.

151
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,000
It's beautiful.

152
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,200
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

153
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,800
You ever get scared out there?

154
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,000
Let me tell you the
only thing you need to know.

155
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,800
This place is
all about survival.

156
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
It's not black and white.
It's all grey.

157
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
The sooner you realize that,

158
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
the better chance you've got
of packing your shit

159
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,200
together one day
and doing that

160
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,700
duffle bag drag
back to the world.

161
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,100
- Understand?
- Yeah.

162
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,200
All right.
Now finish your meal.

163
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,500
[man] Over here. Over here.

164
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,700
[indistinct chatter]

165
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,300
[soft rock plays]

166
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,400
- All right, going for three?
- Going for three.

167
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,300
You beat me twice. I think
you're trying to hustle me, boy.

168
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,900
- Show me the queen.
- Here we go.

169
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
- The queen, you got it?
- Got it.

170
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,700
Look at this beautiful
black queen.

171
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,300
- Lookin' at her?
- Yeah.

172
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,500
Keep your eye on her, boy. Come
on. You ready? Where's she at?

173
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,300
You got her, right?
Keep your eyes open, boy.

174
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,400
All you've gotta think about
is that beautiful, black,

175
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,600
- thick queen. Where's she at?
- She's right there.

176
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,000
- You sure?
- Positive.

177
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,900
- Damn, boy. Look at that.
- [both laugh]

178
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,500
You're getting hustled,
Verano.

179
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,600
Stop corrupting Terence.

180
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,700
Nobody's corrupting.
Am I corrupting you?

181
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,600
- No.
- Trying to learn something.

182
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,900
- OK.
- Damn this thing.

183
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,900
Big, heavy ass.
Come on, split six.

184
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,900
- Six?
- Yep. Come on.

185
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

186
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Let's go.

187
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,500
Where you at, boy?

188
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,700
- Where's she at?
- She's right there.

189
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,200
- You sure?
- I'm positive.

190
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,200
Uh-oh. Shame, boy.
Come on, pay up.

191
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,100
- Big fucking surprise.
- All good. You'll win next
time.

192
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,600
Better save your cigarettes,
Terence.

193
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,300
[Lidford] Ain't got nothing
to do with you.

194
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,100
What you reading
over there, man?

195
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,700
Romans, Chapter 11.

196
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,000
Romans, Chapter 11.
You hear that?

197
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,300
Got a southern belle out here.
Flip that on to Jeremiah 29:11.

198
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,100
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

199
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,600
- Where'd you find this?
- Chicago.

200
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,500
- What you know about the Bible?
- I'm about to learn you.

201
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Yeah, OK.

202
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,200
"'For I know the thoughts
that I think toward you,'
said the Lord,

203
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
'Thoughts of peace
and not of evil,

204
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,400
to give you
an expected end.

205
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,600
Then shall you
call upon me...'"

206
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,600
"'Then shall you call
upon me and I will listen,

207
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
and I will call you
from the nations

208
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
from which you were banished,
and I will bring you out of
the exile

209
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,200
- in which I carried you.'"
- That's right.

210
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,300
[laughs] What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

211
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,900
Tell him what it mean, Harris.

212
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,000
If you have faith, God will save
you from this horrible shit.

213
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,500
- Mm-hm.
- You got faith?

214
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,900
- Yeah, I do.
- God's gonna save you
from this shit?

215
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,800
- I believe that.
- Well, that's good.

216
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Because while men are cutting
off other men's heads
for trophies

217
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
and hanging ears
around their neck,

218
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,600
it's good to know that Harris
is going to be saved.

219
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,900
- This isn't the end, man.
- This is the end.

220
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,200
Ain't nobody trying to
hear that jive-ass shit.

221
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,600
- You're fucking up my high.
- That book is a high.

222
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
- Here we go.
- That book's a high.

223
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,900
Got men believing they're
gonna get swept out of here.

224
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,600
Shut the fuck up.
How about that?

225
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,000
Got to you, huh?

226
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,900
- I'll kick your ass, man.
- Don't you fucking touch me!

227
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,300
- Yeah.
- Do something, nigga.

228
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,300
- You fucking hoodies.
- Go take a shower, bitch.

229
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,700
Yeah.

230
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,700
Come on, boy. Come on.
Put your money up, boy.

231
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,000
Show me the queen.

232
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

233
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,300
[man] Fucking small-minded,
ghetto hoodies. Fantasy land.

234
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,600
- What's your name? Gil...
- Graybridge.

235
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Graybridge.
Where you from, Graybridge?

236
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,200
Let me ask you a question.
Do you believe in God?

237
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,600
I believe in God.
Let me ask you a question.

238
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,000
When was the last time
Red Sox won the Series?

239
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,900
I don't know.
Fifty-some years ago, I guess.

240
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,300
That answer your question?
I tell you what.

241
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,700
A greater franchise has never
existed. This is our year.

242
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,200
- Year. Year of the franchise.
- What the fuck are you smoking?

243
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,700
- No, listen. You like burgers?
- Everybody likes burgers.

244
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,500
Right, everybody likes burgers,
but check it out.

245
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,900
In California,
this guy started up a franchise.

246
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,300
That's the magic word.

247
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,000
Burgers, fries, shakes,
speed, like that.

248
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,500
You just find a plot of land,
he fronts the dough. It's easy
as pie.

249
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,800
It's the American dream.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

250
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,800
Which American dream?
This fucking American dream?

251
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,600
I don't know, man. This don't
seem like no dream to me.

252
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
No, you're missing it. I'm
talking about when I get back.

253
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,300
I'm gonna be my own boss.
I'm gonna be an entrepreneur.

254
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,900
- I'm gonna...
- You're gonna...
Me too, Graybridge.

255
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,200
Me too. I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get a girl.

256
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,300
I'm gonna get a boat.
I'm gonna get a little house
on Lake Winnipesaukee.

257
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,000
It's gonna be fucking great.
I'm serious.

258
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,400
But meantime,

259
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,300
this is what we've got right
here. Right fucking here.

260
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,100
There's a forest full
of chinky-eyed motherfuckers,

261
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,500
and they got their vision of the
gook dream, whatever that is.

262
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,900
They'll slit your
fucking throat to get it.

263
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,700
- You're missing it...
- Oh yeah? Tell me.

264
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,100
Burger joints.
They're the wave of the future.

265
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,400
That sounds good.
How about some fucking water?

266
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,100
Yeah. Sure.

267
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,500
Fucking war.

268
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
What the fuck, man?!
Did you piss in this?

269
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,700
- Nah, nah.
- Fuck! Thank you.

270
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,900
You're a real winner.

271
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,700
[Lidford] This is serious shit,
boy, all right? Pay attention.

272
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,100
There's power to the way a man
smokes a cigarette, all right?

273
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
- Right-handed?
- Yeah.

274
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,100
All right.
Relax your shoulders.

275
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Look forward. Inhale.

276
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,700
- [coughing] Shit!
- You all right?

277
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,600
Heading to the tunnels tomorrow.
I wouldn't be smoking.

278
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,500
The VC don't give a damn
about no cigarette smoke.

279
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,800
When you're underground in a
confined space, the VC can smell
anything on you:

280
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,000
Your aftershave,
cigarette smoke in your uniform.

281
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,500
They can even tell what brand.
If that happens, you're as good
as dead.

282
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Bullshit, Johnson.
Bullshit, all right?

283
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,500
My mom would kill me
if she saw me doing this.

284
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,100
I wouldn't worry about your mom
killing you tomorrow, Verano.

285
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,500
My parents have a house
on Lake Michigan.

286
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,200
And at night, me and my sister,
we'd sneak out and go down
to the beach.

287
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
We'd run up the sand dune and
lay there and look at the stars.

288
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,600
We'd talk about
all kinds of shit.

289
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,900
She'd talk about girl stuff
and I'd talk about baseball.

290
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,100
We'd spend hours up there.

291
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,800
I remember one time... [laughs]

292
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,600
...we fell asleep up there
and we got in so much trouble.

293
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,800
I woke up to my fucking dog
licking me in my face.

294
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't know, man.

295
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,400
I'd do anything
to see my family right now.

296
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,000
My sister and my dog
and my parents.

297
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
What about your folks?

298
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,300
It must have been pretty tough
on you, your mom and your dad.

299
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,000
You don't know shit about
my mom and my dad.

300
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,700
Sorry.

301
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,900
Why you asking all these
stupid-ass questions, anyway?

302
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,800
- Get the fuck off my bunk, man.
- I didn't mean anything. Sorry.

303
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
[Porterson]
None of that shit matters.

304
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,100
Where you've been,
where you're from.

305
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,300
Right now you're in Vietnam.

306
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,500
It matters what you do
on that field.

307
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,300
Oh, shit.

308
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,600
Got a blow a kiss to my girl.

309
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,000
Oh, yeah. The moon
is nice and bright out there.

310
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,100
- Who you out there kissing?
- Oh, it's a concept

311
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
me and my girl came up with:
the satellite of love.

312
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,200
I send a kiss up every night
and she takes one down from
the moon.

313
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,500
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

314
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,800
Let me ask you something.

315
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,700
What happened with you
and Hollowborn today?

316
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,200
We had to talk
a couple things out.

317
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,900
- Did you get to say anything?
- Not much.

318
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,200
Yeah, maybe next time you'll
keep your mouth shut, huh?

319
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,400
Hero. John Wayne.

320
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,800
Thanks for the headset, Verano.

321
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,600
Oh, man!

322
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
Would you eat here?

323
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,800
[laughs] Yeah, it looks good.

324
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,100
Hey. Thanks.

325
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,200
[indistinct chatter]

326
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
[Harris] I heard about
these tunnels.

327
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,500
I had an uncle who died
here last year.

328
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Your uncle obviously
didn't have an M-60.

329
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,700
They say they stretch
for hundreds of miles.

330
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,100
No one knows where
they start or where they end.

331
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,700
This is a really bad
place to be.

332
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,800
- This is it. You ready?
- I was born ready.

333
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,600
- You nervous?
- Not at all.
Just follow my lead.

334
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,700
- You got it.
- [imitating] You got it.

335
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,400
You just love following the
white man, don't you, boy?

336
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
Saddle up, motherfuckers.
We're moving out.

337
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,300
- Corporal Green, take point.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,000
Garraty, get that 60, in front
of me. Johnson, bring up the
rear. Let's go. Fall in.

339
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,700
[Hollowborn] RTO, you do not
leave my side.

340
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,000
Let's go. Let's go.

341
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,600
[man] Right away.

342
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,100
[whistles]

343
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,300
Check it out, man.

344
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,300
- Heaney.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,600
Secure the perimeter.

346
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,400
Verano, Lidford, Green,
give me a perimeter.

347
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,500
We found this tunnel before
sundown, and I'm not clearing
a tunnel at night.

348
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,200
OK, this is what it's all
about.

349
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,600
I'm using a stick,

350
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,500
whereas a knife
might set off a trap.

351
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,200
And these holes are full of
them.

352
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,400
Volunteers.

353
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,700
- Got it, sir.
- I'll go first.

354
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,500
Garraty, Johnson, Porterson.

355
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,300
I ain't got a lot of cock,
but I've got a lot of balls.

356
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,500
Harris, take the 60.

357
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,500
- Fucking John Wayne.
- Fucking A.

358
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,900
Hey, Garraty,
five bucks for a dead gook.

359
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,100
All right.

360
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Later, fuckers.

361
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,900
- [gunshot]
- Shit.

362
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,900
- What the fuck, man?
- I'll get him.

363
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,800
Watch your fucking six.

364
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,800
[gasping]

365
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
[gunshot]

366
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,700
[man] Shot in the stomach!
Coming up!

367
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,300
Porterson, give me a hand.

368
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,800
[gasping]

369
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,200
I need another compress!

370
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,600
[gasping]

371
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,900
[Porterson] I'm right here.
I gotcha. I gotcha.

372
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
You hold on, man.

373
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,200
Garraty, look at me.
Look at me. I'm right here.

374
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,600
You're going to make it.
Just hang in there.

375
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,400
You're going to make it.
Hold on.

376
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,300
Garraty? Look at me. Look at me.

377
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,400
- Shit!
- Clear him. Porterson,
give me grenades.

378
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,300
- Give me grenades.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,500
[Hollowborn] Blow it. Blow it
and get the fuck out of there!

380
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,200
[man] Come on!

381
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,900
[Hollowborn] Come on!

382
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,200
- Come on!
- Get him out!

383
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,200
[man] Get the fuck out!

384
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,200
[man] Eyes on that treeline.

385
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
How many VC did
you see down there?

386
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,500
I saw two VC, lieutenant.

387
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,300
All right, get some
CS gas down there.

388
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,500
Harris?

389
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,100
I'm gonna take Garraty
back to base camp. Heaney.

390
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,900
I want them to gather
as much intel as is left.

391
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Dave, Bob,
you're going with me.

392
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,200
Yes, Sir.

393
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,500
Miller, leave the radio with me.

394
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,100
[man] Still on that treeline.

395
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,300
[Hollowborn] Come on,
let's get him up.

396
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,000
- [man] Porterson, you ready?
- Ready.

397
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,200
[Porterson] We've got one!
Got one VC coming up!

398
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,100
- Got him?
- Coming up.

399
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,400
Over here.

400
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,300
- His fucking leg.
- Grab it.

401
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,100
- [Porterson] Got another one.
- [man] Got another one.

402
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,100
Lidford, give me a knife
and a flashlight.

403
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,900
We're going back down.

404
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,000
- [man] Hook it up.
- [man #2] I got it.

405
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,900
- [man] All set.
- [man #2] Back down.

406
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,200
[man] Let's get this hooked up.

407
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,700
- The radio's on.
- Here you go.

408
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,200
Keep your eyes peeled.

409
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,500
[metal scraping]

410
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,200
[panting]

411
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,100
It's a dead end.
There's nothing down here.

412
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,100
[speaking Vietnamese]

413
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,500
[panting]

414
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,800
[Johnson] I'm gonna go up
and check the surrounding area,

415
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,700
see if I can find
Sergeant Heaney,

416
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,600
let him know this section's
clear. Cover the rear.

417
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,600
Right behind you.

418
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,700
[gagging]

419
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,200
[Porterson] Johnson!

420
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,600
Johnson! Johnson!

421
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,900
[gagging]

422
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
[panting]

423
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,100
Alpha Bravo, come in. Over.
Check the tension.

424
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,900
- It's loose.
- Shit!

425
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,700
Harris, Lidford,
stay here in case they come
back.

426
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,600
Green, Verano, come with me.
We're gonna check that out.

427
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Yes, sir.

428
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,800
[vomiting]

429
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,800
- Jesus Christ.
- Fucking Christ.

430
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
We need to get to
Harris and Lidford.

431
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,500
- What about Porterson?
- We're gonna leave him here?

432
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,900
We'll come back.
We need to get back.

433
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,800
What about Porterson?

434
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,300
[grunting]

435
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,800
[coughing]

436
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,400
[grunts]

437
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,900
What the fuck, man? Where the
fuck is everybody else?

438
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,800
- Johnson's dead.
- What the fuck you mean
he's dead?

439
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
What you think
he means he's dead?

440
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,200
He's got a fucking hole in the
neck the size of a baseball

441
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,100
- and blood coming out his eyes!
- Hey!

442
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,800
- Calm the fuck down.
- We get the picture.

443
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,100
- What about Porterson?
- We didn't see him.

444
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,700
- What now?
- Harris, get on the radio.

445
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,100
Try to get a hold of the
lieutenant. Lidford,
I need you to cover him.

446
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,500
Verano, you also. Corporal,
stay. I'm going in.

447
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,400
- I'm going with you.
- Sure about that?

448
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,800
Fuck that.
Fuck "Corporal, stay here."

449
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,100
Charlie Six to Alpha One, over.

450
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,500
We're sitting fucking ducks
for Charlie right now.

451
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,900
I think you understand that,
sergeant.

452
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Yes, I do.

453
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,700
Charlie Six to Alpha One, over.

454
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,800
- Fuck this!
- Come on!

455
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,200
[Harris] Charlie Six to Alpha
One, over.

456
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,700
[Green] We're supposed to stick
around like a bunch of ducks

457
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,100
waiting for Charlie
to come to us? Fuck that.

458
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
[Heaney] Hold tight.
Hold tight.

459
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,400
[Green] Good luck,
fuckers.

460
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,800
- [Lidford] Get that working.
- I'm trying.

461
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,500
Get that shit working!
Make the fucking shit work!

462
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,400
Make the shit work!
Make it work!

463
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,800
That's not gonna help, OK?

464
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,600
It's dead, man. It's dead.

465
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,100
Shh.

466
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,000
What's wrong?

467
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,900
The tunnel splits
