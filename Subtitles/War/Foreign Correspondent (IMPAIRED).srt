1

- Same old daily bunkeroo.

2

Mr. Powers says he wants to see that
foreign stuff as soon as it comes in.

3

Don't declare war
for a few minutes.

4

7
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,720
I could get more news out of Europe
looking in a crystal ball.

8
00:02:32,844 --> 00:02:35,814
That, uh, Stebbins cable
has a morsel in it.

9
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:39,022
Stebbins makes me sick.
They all make me sick.

10
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:42,988
Europe about to blow up, and all
I can get out of my foreign staff...

11
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:45,028
is a daily guessing game.

12
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:49,073
- I want some facts, Mr. Bradley!
- For instance?

13
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:51,196
Any kind of facts.

14
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:54,746
There must be something going on
in Europe beside a nervous breakdown.

15
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:57,961
Why not try sending me over,
Mr. Powers?

16
00:02:59,705 --> 00:03:02,458
You've written a book
on economics or something...

17
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,335
<i>The Twilight of Feudalism.</i>

18
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:06,427
Yes. It was very
well received.

19
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:08,718
Not by me. I don't want
any more economists...

20
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:11,638
sages or oracles bombinating
over our cables.

21
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,477
I want a reporter, somebody
who doesn't know the difference...

22
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,268
between an "ism" and a kangaroo.

23
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:19,642
A good, honest crime reporter...
that's what the <i>Globe</i> needs.

24
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,359
That's what Europe needs.

25
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:24,605
There's a crime hatching
on that bedeviled continent.

26
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,983
Wait a minute.

27
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,701
I've got something that
might pass for an idea.

28
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:35,082
Who was that fellow that ran down
the payroll robbery last week?

29
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:36,745
Oh, you mean Johnny Jones.

30
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,495
He beat up a policeman,
didn't he, in the line of duty?

31
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,123
Yes, there's talk at the
City desk of firing him.

32
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:45,046
Hmm.
Beat up a policeman, eh?

33
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,299
Sounds ideal for Europe.

34
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:52,345
Send Mr. Jones up here
right away.

35

- You should come right away.

Tell him I've resigned.

39

- Okay.

40
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:12,696
Wait till I open this.

41

I told you to send him right up here!

European crisis, Mr. Jones?

Oh, that.

52

To tell you the truth, Mr. Powers,
I haven't given it much thought.

53
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:54,737
You don't keep up with our
foreign news, do you?

54

Mr. Powers, if you're gonna fire me,
you can scrap the intelligence test.

It's okay with me. I can get a job
on any other newspaper in town.

by our oracle, Mr. Stebbins...

152
00:09:57,455 --> 00:10:01,585
I could say it yesterday, but I had a
tough session with the boys last night.

153
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,964
- I'll stick to Jones, if you don't mind.
- Jones is great with me.

154
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:07,341
Let's get out of here.
This crowd's making me nervous.

155
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:09,467
My nerves aren't
in the pink this morning.

156
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,594
You take it easy.
I'll follow you.

157
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,522
Porter, bring those bags, and
don't bang them into my knees.

158
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:15,466
Very good, sir.

159
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:21,108
What about a drink
after that long train ride?

160
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:23,114
Sounds like
a very logical idea.

161
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:26,026
I may not act it,
but I've been here 25 years...

162

London man for the <i>Globe,</i>
and they haven't caught on to me yet.

163
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:30,583
How did you manage it?

164
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,770
You cable back the
government handouts...

165
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,085
and sign 'em
"our London correspondent."

166
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,078
- What's yours?
- Scotch and soda, please.

167
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,626
- Miss? Oh, miss?
- Just a moment, sir.

168
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:43,797
Oh, miss, please...

169
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:46,091
Scotch and soda
and a glass of milk.

170
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,635
- "A glass of milk"?
- I'm on the wagon.

171
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:51,476
I went to the doctor today
about these jitters...

172
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:55,639
and he said it was the wagon
for a month or a new set of organs.

173
00:10:55,764 --> 00:10:57,687
I can't afford new organs.

174

If I'd known you were on the wagon,
I could've got along without this...

Good luck.

177
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:11,205
- Good?
- Just like any other scotch and soda.

178

That's what I thought.

179
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:18,792
Doesn't taste the way it did when I
was a baby. That's got poison in it.

180
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,165
Speaking of poison,
I got some pills...

181
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,834
Oh, some cables have been
coming over from New York.

182
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,178
They love to cable. Makes them
think you're working for them.

183
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,342
There's an invitation to that lunch
for the Dutchman Van Meer tomorrow.

That's Fisher's organization, isn't it?

those things very much.

New York wants it, I send it. That's
the secret of being a correspondent.

210
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:16,867
I dislike riding alone.

211
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:19,411
One thinks too much
while riding alone.

212
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,785
Yes, exactly.
The Polish situation...

213

Always there is lots
of rain or fog.

Also, it is August.

219
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,769
Yes, I found out it was August.
That was good for me.

220
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,234

telling me how you feel...

about Mr. Fisher and his

You know Mr. Fisher?

223
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:52,816
Oh, a very fine man.

224
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:57,162
A good man. I wish there were more
like him in the world just now.

225
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,782
Then I take it you don't think
there's much hope for peace.

226
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,911
I mean, you don't think
one little peace organization...

227
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:06,379
can make much headway
against the European war panic.

228
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:10,672
I would like to think so.
Oh, look at those birds.

feeding the birds.

That's a good sign
at a time like this, is it not?

234
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:29,019
Yes, it's a dandy sign...

are the least of our problems.

How much?

239
00:14:44,701 --> 00:14:46,829
A shilling.

the Lats had a language.

303
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:31,178
I thought they just
rubbed noses.

304
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:35,060
You mean,
you actually speak Latvian?

305
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,104
Oh, just enough to get about.

306
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:40,229
What does "just enough
to get about" consist of in Latvia?

307
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,572
Well, I don't think
you'd have any trouble.

308
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:45,111
That'll be a comfort

Me? Excuse me.

321
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:15,431
I beg your pardon,
but I have a Latvian friend here...

322
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,899
who's particularly interested
in the origin of the kilt.

323
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:21,736
I wonder if you'd be interested in
talking to him. He's a lovely fellow.

324
00:19:21,852 --> 00:19:25,106
It's a most amazing story.
You see...

325
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:28,451
the Greeks, in the early period,
they used to wear a kilt.

326
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:31,492
What is this big secret
conference all about?

327
00:19:31,612 --> 00:19:33,614
It's no secret
as far as I'm concerned.

328
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,492
However, I'll let you in
on that part later.

329

the publicity for this outfit...

on what it's about...

What is it you'd like to know?

333
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:48,213
First, is this Mr. Fisher
entirely on the level?

334
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:51,682
- Very much so.
- He seems like a very nice guy.

335
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:53,514
He is, I assure you.

336
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:56,308
Well, what is it that
makes him, or you, think...

337
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,353
that an organization like this,
made up of well-meaning amateurs...

338
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:01,813
buck up against those tough
military boys of Europe?

339
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,153
It's the "well-meaning amateurs,"

344
00:20:13,863 --> 00:20:15,865
Then sit at the press
table with me.

345
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:19,036
Nobody listens to the speeches
at the press table. We could talk.

346
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,454
- You don't know my name yet.
- Is it necessary?

347
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:24,082
It is to me.
Don't mind if you hear...

00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:09,548
which I'm sure will be
a great disappointment to us all.

361
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,092
I've just received this telegram
from Mr. Van Meer...

our guest of honor today.</i>

What I can do, possibly, is
to clear up a few misapprehensions...

386
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:38,432
that seem to have crept into the
public discussion of this movement...

of the epithets applied to us...

into the matter as they might.</i>

called us "well-meaning amateurs"...

393
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:01,368
to stand up by his chair
and tell me just why...

394
00:23:01,489 --> 00:23:03,958
a well-meaning amateur
is any less reliable...

395
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:06,577
than a well-meaning professional
at a moment like this...

to get used
to the first man you were.

759
00:55:24,138 --> 00:55:27,142
To be perfectly frank,
I expected a little more argument.

760
00:55:27,266 --> 00:55:30,270
I'm left with quite a few things
I wanted to say.

761
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:33,648
Save them until after we're married.
I imagine they'll sound much better then.

762
00:55:33,814 --> 00:55:35,407
I'd saved things to say then too.

763
00:55:35,524 --> 00:55:38,573
You were really quite sure
of yourself, weren't you?

764
00:55:38,694 --> 00:55:40,742
Funny... I didn't think
I had a chance.

765
00:55:40,863 --> 00:55:42,945
A guy's got a right to
dream, though, hasn't he?

766
00:55:42,971 --> 00:55:43,607
Evidently.

767
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:46,043
Do you think your father
will understand?

768
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,164
I think Father
will be delighted, frankly.

769
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:10,976
Right, sir.

770
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:20,995
- Good morning, Miss Carol.
- Good morning, Stiles.

771
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:24,581
- This is Mr. Haverstock. Is Father up yet?
- Yes, miss. He's having breakfast.

772
00:56:24,698 --> 00:56:26,371
Come on.

773
00:56:31,705 --> 00:56:34,333
- Hello, Father.
- What are you doing in London?

774
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,881
Jo... Mr. Haverstock
brought me back on the boat.

775
00:56:37,002 --> 00:56:39,596
Nothing wrong, is there?
You're not ill? You look healthy.

776
00:56:39,713 --> 00:56:41,215
No, I'm fine.
It's Mr. Haverstock.

777
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:43,383
I hope you don't mind
my barging in.

778
00:56:43,509 --> 00:56:47,355
On the contrary. I'm delighted.
You cover a lot of territory, don't you?

779
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:48,731
<i>You didn't even send a wire.</i>

780
00:56:48,757 --> 00:56:51,592
<i>Just for that, I hope your trip
was perfectly uncomfortable.</i>

781
00:56:51,725 --> 00:56:54,194
It wasn't so bad.
We couldn't get cabins...

782
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:56,484
but we managed
to sleep on the deck.

783
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:58,699
Monsieur Krug.
How nice to see you again.

784
00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:00,818
Mr. Haverstock,
Monsieur Krug.

785
00:57:03,237 --> 00:57:06,241
Monsieur Krug is a member
of the Borovian Embassy staff here.

786
00:57:06,406 --> 00:57:08,408
Sit down.
Have a spot of breakfast.

787
00:57:08,534 --> 00:57:11,037
I know I should tidy up,
but I'm simply starved.

788
00:57:15,582 --> 00:57:18,051
So you were in Amsterdam
yesterday, Mr. Haverstock?

789
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,921
Poor Van Meer. I count his death
a heavy personal loss.

790
00:57:21,088 --> 00:57:22,965
Of all people, why Van Meer?

791
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:26,390
You can't ask "why" of an assassin.
There's no logic in killing.

792
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:29,559
We can't spare such men
in a world like ours.

793
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,308
Did you by any chance meet him,
Mr. Haverstock?

794
00:57:32,432 --> 00:57:34,560
Not formally,
but I saw him die.

795
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:37,230
Horrible.

796
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:41,234
As a matter of fact, I chased the man
that shot him and almost caught him.

797
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,578
Mr. Haverstock is a newspaperman,
Monsieur Krug.

798
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:47,014
That would be quite a
coup, bringing in your

799
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,100
first story wrapped
around an assassin.

800
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:53,417
I shall have to be
getting along now, Mr. Fisher.

801
00:57:54,955 --> 00:57:58,334
Shall we settle on the wording
for the peace petition now or later?

802
00:57:58,458 --> 00:58:01,803
We may as well clear it up
in the study. You'll excuse us?

803
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,548
Father, could I speak to you?
It's terribly important.

804
00:58:04,673 --> 00:58:08,348
This won't take a moment. Meanwhile, see
if you can't interest Mr. Haverstock...

805
00:58:08,468 --> 00:58:10,687
in some eggs and bacon.

806
00:58:10,804 --> 00:58:12,556
Mr. Fisher... What's
that man doing here?

807
00:58:12,582 --> 00:58:13,582
It's Monsieur Krug.

808
00:58:13,682 --> 00:58:15,935
- Van Meer isn't dead.
- But I just read...

809
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,107
That was his double.
Van Meer was kidnapped.

810
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,276
I talked to him in a
mill outside Amsterdam.

811
00:58:20,302 --> 00:58:21,803
What has Krug to do with it?

812
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:24,069
Remember my description
of the man in the mill?

813
00:58:24,095 --> 00:58:25,269
You mean the sweater?

814
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,988
Of course! But that's impossible.
We've known Monsieur Krug...

815
00:58:28,155 --> 00:58:31,101
Mr. Krug brought Van Meer here by
plane last night. He's in England.

816
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:31,980
They're hiding him.

817
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,132
Positive about this?

818
00:58:33,158 --> 00:58:35,695
I was as close to Krug
as I am to you now.

819
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:38,274
<i>It'd be terrible if we made a mistake.
On the other hand...</i>

820
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,358
<i>(KRUG) Mr. Fisher.</i>

821
00:58:39,499 --> 00:58:41,501
Leave it to me.

822
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:46,428
(BARKS)

823
00:58:46,548 --> 00:58:49,802
<i>I don't want to seem inhospitable,
but I must ask you to leave.</i>

824
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:53,352
Mr. Haverstock is going to suggest
I turn you over to the police.

825
00:58:53,472 --> 00:58:56,851
Mr. Haverstock seems to be
something of a troublemaker.

826
00:58:56,975 --> 00:59:00,525
I thought you said he'd been taken
care of by our agents in Amsterdam.

827
00:59:00,646 --> 00:59:02,364
<i>I thought so too.</i>

828
00:59:02,481 --> 00:59:04,779
<i>I don't understand if,
unless perhaps...</i>

829
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,325
Miss Fisher's being with him
may have caused complications.

830
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:11,119
It would've been ideal
if she'd been in our confidence.

831
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:13,116
Leave my daughter out of it.

832
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:15,915
- I beg your pardon.
- Most unfortunate, his coming here.

833
00:59:16,036 --> 00:59:19,631
I've never had to cope with this sort
of thing before, thanks to you.

834
00:59:19,748 --> 00:59:22,046
Someone has to take care
of the sordid details.

835
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:26,673
But this is close to home. In fact, it is
my home. After all, I'm only a politician.

836
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,595
In a sense.

837
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:32,060
And politicians aren't usually
called upon to, uh...

838
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:34,392
do away with their guests,
are they?

839
00:59:34,513 --> 00:59:36,515
<i>- (DOG BARKS)</i>
- Quiet, boy. Quiet.

840
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,063
Not in the house.
No, sir.

841
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:42,150
- But I have an idea.
<i>- (BARKING CONTINUES)</i>

842
00:59:47,859 --> 00:59:50,578
- Do you remember Rowley?
- Rowley?

843
00:59:50,696 --> 00:59:54,371
Yes, the little man who used to work
at your father's stables in Austria.

844
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:58,621
Yes, I recall he was present
when a mutual friend of ours, um...

845
00:59:58,745 --> 01:00:01,498
accidentally fell off
the high bridge at Bern.

846
01:00:01,623 --> 01:00:03,250
He's retired now.

847
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:05,628
Lives somewhere in
Clapham here in London.

848
01:00:05,752 --> 01:00:08,426
If Mr. Haverstock could be
induced to hire him...

849
01:00:08,547 --> 01:00:11,141
in the capacity
of a private detective...

850
01:00:11,258 --> 01:00:13,477
- What for?
- Well...

851
01:00:13,593 --> 01:00:17,348
you should warn him that it is
very dangerous to go about London...

852
01:00:17,472 --> 01:00:19,566
with the knowledge
that he has.

853
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:22,607
<i>- (DOG BARKS)</i>
- Yes, I see. Yes.

854
01:00:23,603 --> 01:00:26,106
You use the English language
with great delicacy, Krug.

855
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:29,235
Thank you, sir. I shall look
Mr. Rowley up at once...

856
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:30,952
and give him his instructions.

857
01:00:31,069 --> 01:00:33,788
But you mustn't.
It would be too dangerous.

858
01:00:35,782 --> 01:00:37,618
What do we do?
Call Scotland Yard?

859
01:00:37,644 --> 01:00:40,108
I thought it best to
send Krug on his way.

860
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,297
You let him get away?
Well, listen...

861
01:00:42,414 --> 01:00:46,294
Don't you see how important it is
not to rouse Krug's suspicions?

862
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:49,464
- Van Meer will be killed immediately.
- Dead or alive, it's a story.

863
01:00:49,588 --> 01:00:51,261
Johnny, Father's right.

864
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,885
- Okay, I'll cable them what I've got.
- I wouldn't if I were you.

865
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,889
Van Meer's life may depend
upon our keeping this quiet.

866
01:00:58,013 --> 01:00:59,731
Keep it quiet?

867
01:00:59,848 --> 01:01:03,853
A famous diplomat's kidnapped under
my own eyes, and I muzzle myself?

868
01:01:03,977 --> 01:01:06,776
I'm sorry,
but this is a story with facts...

869
01:01:06,897 --> 01:01:10,652
the kind I was sent here to get,
the kind America's waiting for.

870
01:01:10,776 --> 01:01:13,575
It'll be bigger if you can wait
just a few hours...

871
01:01:13,695 --> 01:01:17,495
until we can find Van Meer and discover
what's behind this whole curious business.

872
01:01:17,616 --> 01:01:20,369
- I know what's behind it.
- I don't mean who's behind it.

873
01:01:20,494 --> 01:01:22,496
I mean the why of it.

874
01:01:22,621 --> 01:01:26,342
Dear, will you get me
all my correspondence with Krug?

875
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:28,176
Please, Johnny,
do what Father says.

876
01:01:28,335 --> 01:01:30,838
It'll be best for you
and poor Mr. Van Meer.

877
01:01:31,004 --> 01:01:33,177
Okay. I'll wait.

878
01:01:36,551 --> 01:01:37,537
I'm worried about you.

879
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:40,251
I'm a little worried about myself.
I feel weak-minded.

880
01:01:40,347 --> 01:01:43,851
You're doing the right thing, but I don't
like you dashing about without protection.

881
01:01:44,017 --> 01:01:44,568
Forget it.

882
01:01:44,594 --> 01:01:46,795
If what you say is true,
you need protection.

883
01:01:46,895 --> 01:01:49,161
I've covered beer mob
killings and race riots

884
01:01:49,187 --> 01:01:51,551
since I was a tot without
even a rabbit's foot.

885
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,643
These people are
criminals, more dangerous

886
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,521
than your rumrunners
and housebreakers.

887
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:57,239
They're fanatics.

888
01:01:57,364 --> 01:01:59,478
They combine a mad
love of country with

889
01:01:59,504 --> 01:02:01,565
an equally mad
indifference to life...

890
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:03,999
their own as well as others.

891
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:06,715
They're cunning,
unscrupulous...

892
01:02:06,832 --> 01:02:09,085
and... inspired.

893
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:14,089

face Mr. Powers again...

I'm gonna be a fine foreign correspondent
hiding in an attic somewhere.

896
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:25,226
I'm not suggesting you hide anywhere.
Just get somebody to watch out for you.

897
01:02:25,392 --> 01:02:28,191
A nurse? Johnny Jones goes
to Europe and hires a nurse.

898
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,939
That's gonna look great
on the expense account.

899
01:02:31,064 --> 01:02:34,910
I know a very efficient private detective
agency where we can get just the man.

900
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:37,821

01:12:28,035 --> 01:12:30,538
Good morning, Stebbins.
How are you, Haverstock?

1055
01:12:30,663 --> 01:12:33,337
Congratulations on your little
set-to with Rowley.

1056
01:12:35,376 --> 01:12:37,504
What do you know
about Rowley?

1057
01:12:37,628 --> 01:12:40,256
Very little ffolliott doesn't hear.
He probably even knows about Fisher.

1058
01:12:40,381 --> 01:12:42,179
I was onto Fisher
a year ago...

1059
01:12:42,341 --> 01:12:44,343
but that fellow
with the high-neck sweater...

1060
01:12:44,469 --> 01:12:46,847
- Krug... he's new to me...
- You're onto him too?

1061
01:12:47,013 --> 01:12:49,857
- Followed him to London.
- I thought you were cold on this story.

1062
01:12:49,974 --> 01:12:52,523
On the contrary.
I've been doing a bit of noticing.

1063
01:12:52,643 --> 01:12:55,237
- Remember that tramp asleep in the mill?
- Yeah.

1064
01:12:55,354 --> 01:12:58,528
- He wasn't a tramp at all.
- Van Meer, I suppose.

1065
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:02,324
Not quite, but I noticed him
do a strange thing for a tramp.

1066
01:13:02,445 --> 01:13:05,289
He dirtied his hands
with some of that nasty Dutch soil.

1067
01:13:05,406 --> 01:13:08,250
I can't follow the workings
of these masterminds.

1068
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:10,961
(RINGS)

1069
01:13:11,078 --> 01:13:13,376
No.
Tell him it's ridiculous.

1070
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:17,176
You'd already disappeared,
so I followed Krug...

1071
01:13:17,293 --> 01:13:19,295
but ended up
at the same old mousetrap.

1072
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,842
You mean Fisher?

1073
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:24,092
The good, kind, genial head
of the Peace Party, Herr Fisher.

1074
01:13:24,217 --> 01:13:26,470
(RINGS)

1075
01:13:26,594 --> 01:13:28,892
Hello, Eddie?
This is Plunger Stebbins.

1076
01:13:29,013 --> 01:13:31,983
I want to place a bet
on Flibbertigibbet in the first...

1077
01:13:32,099 --> 01:13:36,195
The race is over? What do you know
about that? Okay, I'll call you later.

1078
01:13:36,312 --> 01:13:39,065
Any objection to working
the rest of this thing together?

1079
01:13:39,232 --> 01:13:41,735
Catch Fisher, find Van Meer,
that sort of thing?

1080
01:13:41,859 --> 01:13:45,113
All right, but I'd like to know
why they kidnapped Van Meer.

1081
01:13:45,238 --> 01:13:47,741
He was one of the signatories
to a certain treaty.

1082
01:13:47,907 --> 01:13:49,955
The most important clause
was never written down...

1083
01:13:50,076 --> 01:13:52,249
just memorized
by the two people who signed.

1084
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:54,088
They're gonna
beat it out of him?

1085
01:13:54,247 --> 01:13:57,592
They're going to try. It'd be
a good idea if we put a stop to them.

1086
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,253
It contains information
that would be valuable to the enemy...

1087
01:14:00,419 --> 01:14:02,888
in the war that breaks out tomorrow,
weather permitting.

1088
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:05,383
What? Why didn't someone
let me in on this?

1089
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:08,432
- Stebbins, we've got to get busy.
- Plenty of time. Lunch first.

1090
01:14:08,553 --> 01:14:10,851
You mind waiting?
You might be of some help.

1091
01:14:10,972 --> 01:14:13,566
I thought up a little plan
for forcing Fisher's hand.

1092
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:15,310
Let's have it.

1093
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:19,029
I think the neatest thing would be
to kidnap Fisher's daughter.

1094
01:14:20,106 --> 01:14:20,841
Oh, yeah?

1095
01:14:20,867 --> 01:14:23,806
One of Fisher's few genuine traits
is his affection for Miss Fisher.

1096
01:14:23,943 --> 01:14:26,116
<i>Easy. You're speaking
to the man who loves her.</i>

1097
01:14:26,237 --> 01:14:28,786
All the better. Give you
a chance to get chummy...

1098
01:14:28,906 --> 01:14:32,501
and keep her out of this mess
while we batter away at papa.

1099
01:14:32,618 --> 01:14:35,167
This is my scheme:
I walk in, let Fisher know...

1100
01:14:35,288 --> 01:14:37,791
his daughter's in the hands
of someone who means business...

1101
01:14:37,957 --> 01:14:41,461
just as he means business when he
kidnaps people. He'll see things our way.

1102
01:14:41,586 --> 01:14:43,666
- Nothing doing.
- I thought you were a newspaperman.

1103
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:46,216
That doesn't include kidnapping
your fiancee where I come from.

1104
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:49,389
- It would if your country were at stake.
- This isn't my country.

1105
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:52,480
It's your story. Don't be gloomy.
She doesn't have to know.

1106
01:14:52,597 --> 01:14:55,817
- Just keep her amused.
- Why not grab Fisher and have a showdown?

1107
01:14:55,933 --> 01:14:59,654
No good. We've got nothing
on Fisher. He'd slip out of it anyway.

1108
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:02,444
All we'd do would be
to kill Van Meer.

1109
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:04,442
<i>- Mm.
- (KNOCK AT DOOR)</i>

1110
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:08,242
Hello, darling. Are you all right?
What were you doing on the tower?

1111
01:15:08,362 --> 01:15:11,240
Trying to keep out of harm's way,
but those assassins followed.

1112
01:15:11,266 --> 01:15:13,018
There was a scuffle,
and over he went.

1113
01:15:13,117 --> 01:15:15,415
Darling, they won't stop
till they get you.

1114
01:15:15,536 --> 01:15:17,755
You must leave London
immediately.

1115
01:15:20,499 --> 01:15:23,469
The one thing everybody
forgets is I'm a reporter.

1116
01:15:23,586 --> 01:15:25,384
There's a war.
I can't run out.

1117
01:15:25,504 --> 01:15:29,008
Scott, he can't stay here.
Tell him how desperate these men are.

1118
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:31,227
He shouldn't stay another minute.
Take him somewhere.

1119
01:15:31,344 --> 01:15:32,063
I won't go.

1120
01:15:32,089 --> 01:15:34,964
Couldn't you think up some aunt
in the country or something?

1121
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:37,900
There's my Aunt Margaret at Harpenden.
Let me take you there.

1122
01:15:38,017 --> 01:15:40,019
- How about it?
- Stay out of this.

1123
01:15:40,186 --> 01:15:42,314
It's the only
sensible thing to do.

1124
01:15:42,438 --> 01:15:44,611
May I use your telephone?

1125
01:15:44,732 --> 01:15:46,405
<i>(DIALING)</i>

1126
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:54,125
Hello, Stiles?
Miss Carol speaking.

1127
01:15:54,241 --> 01:15:57,541
Tell Mr. Fisher I'm driving down
to Aunt Margaret's at Harpenden.

1128
01:15:57,662 --> 01:16:00,506
- I won't go.
<i>- I'll be back in time for dinner.</i>

1129
01:16:00,623 --> 01:16:02,250
<i>- Thank you.
- (PHONE HANGS UP)</i>

1130
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:04,374
it's settled. We can
get you a toothbrush...

1131
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,199
It's no good.

1132
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:08,138
I'm wondering whether this idea
of your aunt is so good.

1133
01:16:08,255 --> 01:16:10,257
Maybe it'd be better further out...
say, Cambridge.

1134
01:16:10,383 --> 01:16:12,207
There's no place as
obscure as Harpenden.

1135
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:13,708
It isn't so
much the place...

1136
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:16,147
as the fact Krug
might connect you with it.

1137
01:16:16,263 --> 01:16:17,607
You're right.
Make it Cambridge.

1138
01:16:17,633 --> 01:16:19,588
I'll phone your father
so he doesn't worry.

1139
01:16:19,684 --> 01:16:22,563
Thank you, Scott.
Please, Johnny?

1140
01:16:33,698 --> 01:16:36,918
That was a break, her suggesting
they go to the country.

1141
01:16:37,034 --> 01:16:40,038
As a matter of fact, old boy,
I suggested it to her...

1142
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:42,210
on the phone
about half an hour ago.

1143
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:54,515
There hasn't been a sign
of anybody for the last 30 miles.

1144
01:16:55,553 --> 01:16:57,897
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

1145
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:01,894
You might at least talk to me.
It's unfair to sit there and pout...

1146
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:04,771
because I've kidnapped you
from your so-called duties.

1147
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,772
- You've kidnapped me?
- Mm-hmm.

1148
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:09,442
- Just remember that, will you?
- Please forgive me.

1149
01:17:09,608 --> 01:17:11,736
Why, sure.
I don't think kidnapping's...

1150
01:17:11,861 --> 01:17:15,411
anything to get sore about when done
by the right kidnapper, do you?

1151
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,249
- Not at all.
- Thanks.

1152
01:17:18,784 --> 01:17:20,752
(RINGING)

1153
01:17:24,623 --> 01:17:26,170
Hello?

1154
01:17:27,585 --> 01:17:30,964
No, Mr. ffolliott.
I'm afraid he's not in yet.

1155
01:17:31,088 --> 01:17:32,635
Very well, sir.

1156
01:17:44,602 --> 01:17:46,980
- Johnny, you don't love me.
- You're crazy.

1157
01:17:47,146 --> 01:17:50,696
- You looked unhappy when you kissed me.
- Never happier in my life.

1158
01:17:50,816 --> 01:17:52,989
Won't do.
Johnny, what's happened?

1159
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:55,704
The war, I guess.
They say it's coming tomorrow.

1160
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:58,574
So you've changed
your philosophy since yesterday.

1161
01:17:58,699 --> 01:18:01,248
There are more important things
in the world than love.

1162
01:18:01,368 --> 01:18:03,791
- I've got lots to do. Important things.
- Carol...

1163
01:18:03,913 --> 01:18:06,666
Got to get started.
It'll take three hours to get back.

1164
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:10,011
I'm not going to be misunderstood.
I'm so in love, I'm going mad.

1165
01:18:10,127 --> 01:18:12,505
Won't do.
I suppose it can't be helped.

1166
01:18:12,671 --> 01:18:14,924
You've turned European
on me overnight, Johnny.

1167
01:18:15,049 --> 01:18:19,520
That's unfair. I'm just as big
a jackass as I ever was. Bigger.

1168
01:18:19,637 --> 01:18:22,015
You're not going back
to London to dinner tonight.

1169
01:18:22,181 --> 01:18:24,809
You can't run out
on your kidnapper like that.

1170
01:18:24,934 --> 01:18:27,653
I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

1171
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,319
If you run out on me now,
I'm going...

1172
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,658
straight to London
and let them bump me off.

1173
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:34,493
Be a relief at that.

1174
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:37,989
Well, you are moody.
Am I the cause?

1175
01:18:40,616 --> 01:18:44,211
If you knew how much
I loved you, you'd faint.

1176
01:18:52,086 --> 01:18:54,214
There.
What'd I tell you?

1177
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:57,054
<i>- (KNOCK AT DOOR)

1178
01:18:57,174 --> 01:18:58,801

- Yes?

1179
01:18:58,926 --> 01:19:01,054
- Call from London.

Sorry, there's only one phone...

1181
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:05,895
All right, I'll come down.

1182
01:19:06,058 --> 01:19:08,356
Forgive me
for a moment, dear.

1183
01:19:14,316 --> 01:19:16,410
Just a moment, sir.

1184
01:19:23,075 --> 01:19:24,418
Hello?

1185
01:19:24,535 --> 01:19:28,210
Is that you, Haverstock, old boy?
Are you alone? Can you talk?

1186
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:32,130
I can't get a hold of Fisher.
He's been out all afternoon.

1187
01:19:32,251 --> 01:19:35,596
I'm afraid you'll have to keep the girl
much longer than we'd planned.

1188
01:19:35,754 --> 01:19:39,099
I don't know what time he'll be back.
I've got to catch him alone.

1189
01:19:39,216 --> 01:19:40,889
Keep the girl there
for the night.

1190
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:43,263
But that's
absolutely impossible.

1191
01:19:43,387 --> 01:19:45,890
We can't let
this thing go now.

1192
01:19:47,099 --> 01:19:50,979
I can't very well explain, but I simply
couldn't pull a thing like that.

1193
01:19:51,103 --> 01:19:55,358
You've got to try. There isn't anything
else to be done. I'm counting on you.

1194
01:19:55,482 --> 01:19:56,950
Hello?

1195
01:19:58,611 --> 01:20:00,033
Hello?

1196
01:20:10,289 --> 01:20:12,462
Are you quite satisfied
with your room, sir?

1197
01:20:12,625 --> 01:20:15,674
Well, not exactly.
That is, I mean, yes...

1198
01:20:15,794 --> 01:20:18,217
but I really wanted
another room as well...

1199
01:20:18,339 --> 01:20:20,182
a single room.

1200
01:20:20,299 --> 01:20:22,768
Oh. Mr. Naismith?

1201
01:20:22,885 --> 01:20:25,479
<i>Mr. Naismith, this gentleman
wants another room.</i>

1202
01:20:25,638 --> 01:20:29,017
<i>For the young lady?
How long will you be requiring it?</i>

1203
01:20:29,141 --> 01:20:32,065
<i>(JONES) She'll only be here
just the one might.</i>

1204
01:20:34,772 --> 01:20:37,491
- The gentleman has number 7, sir.
- What about number 8?

1205
01:20:37,608 --> 01:20:39,997
It doesn't really make
any difference, so long

1206
01:20:40,023 --> 01:20:42,309
as it's a good room...
windows and all that.

1207
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:44,156
I quite understand, sir.

1208
01:20:44,281 --> 01:20:47,080
I think perhaps the room
next to yours would be best.

1209
01:20:47,201 --> 01:20:50,375
It's quite cozy, isn't it,
Miss Pollitt? Number 8?

1210
01:20:50,496 --> 01:20:53,500
<i>- They're all very much alike to me, sir.
- (JONES) Eight'll do.</i>

1211
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:56,419
Will you bring the young lady
and sign the book, please?

1212
01:20:56,543 --> 01:20:59,046
Yes, I'll... I'll get her.

- Good evening, Stiles.

1215
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:29,540
Terrible thing, sir, that poor man
who was here this morning.

1216
01:21:29,702 --> 01:21:32,125
Yes, terrible, Stiles.
My bags all packed?

1217
01:21:32,246 --> 01:21:34,340
- Yes, sir.
- And Miss Carol's?

1218
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:37,801
Mrs. Stiles packed hers too.
She hopes she's put in the right things.

1219
01:21:37,918 --> 01:21:40,967
It's been such a rush, especially
with Miss Carol not back yet.

1220
01:21:41,088 --> 01:21:43,807
Mr. ffolliott's here now.
He's waiting in the sitting room.

1221
01:21:43,924 --> 01:21:46,268
Another gentleman just phoned.
He wouldn't leave his name.

1222
01:21:46,385 --> 01:21:48,173
I thought I recognized
his voice as the

1223
01:21:48,199 --> 01:21:50,210
foreign gentleman who
was here at breakfast.

1224
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:53,435
- Did he say he'd telephone again?
- Yes, he said it was urgent.

Well, show Mr. ffolliott
into the study.

Hello, sir.

1227
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:16,441
Scott, you caught me
at a very busy moment.

1228
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,588
I'm getting ready to go
to America tomorrow.

1229
01:22:18,709 --> 01:22:20,586
Are you taking
Carol with you?

1230
01:22:20,753 --> 01:22:24,678
Yes. She doesn't know yet. It's been
such a rush. I'm waiting for her now.

1231
01:22:24,798 --> 01:22:28,098
What's your worry? Must be important,
by the number of times you telephoned.

1232
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,058
Yes, it is, sir.
It's about Carol.

1233
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:33,433
- I'm afraid that...
- What? Anything happen to her?

1234
01:22:33,557 --> 01:22:36,276
I don't think you'll be able
to take her to America.

1235
01:22:36,393 --> 01:22:38,566
What do you mean?
Why not?

1236
01:22:39,938 --> 01:22:42,942
It'll sound rather silly to you,
but Carol has been kidnapped.

1237
01:22:43,067 --> 01:22:45,820
- Is this a joke of some sort?
- No, sir.

1238
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:48,618
What do you mean, "kidnapped"?

1239
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:51,330
I happen to know
she's with her aunt in Harpenden.

1240
01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:53,327
I'm afraid she isn't.

1241
01:23:04,671 --> 01:23:08,642
Stiles, who gave you the message that Miss
Carol had gone to her Aunt Margaret's?

1242
01:23:08,759 --> 01:23:11,478
Miss Carol herself, sir.

1243
01:23:11,595 --> 01:23:14,394
- Thank you, Stiles.
- That's where she thought she was going.

1244
01:23:24,775 --> 01:23:27,244
Get me Harpenden 43422.

1245
01:23:29,988 --> 01:23:32,161
Hello, is that you, Margaret?

1246
01:23:32,324 --> 01:23:33,997
Is Carol with you?

1247
01:23:37,246 --> 01:23:39,169
<i>No. No, I...</i>

1248
01:23:39,331 --> 01:23:42,551
<i>I wasn't' certain. She said
she might run down to see you.</i>

1249
01:23:42,668 --> 01:23:46,093
I didn't know whether
to expect her back for dinner.

1250
01:23:46,213 --> 01:23:48,466
Right. Good night, Margaret.

1251
01:23:50,884 --> 01:23:52,807
No, she isn't there.

1252
01:23:53,846 --> 01:23:55,848
What makes you say
she's been kidnapped?

1253
01:23:58,517 --> 01:24:01,487
Well, sir... I arranged it.

1254
01:24:05,023 --> 01:24:07,276
This has gone far enough.
Where is Carol?

1255
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:11,409
Carol's being held
as a sort of hostage...

1256
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:15,501
by some people who are very much
in earnest... as much as you are.

1257
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:19,542
Don't be so cryptic. I haven't the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

1258
01:24:22,374 --> 01:24:24,672
I want to know
where you're hiding Van Meer.

1259
01:24:29,006 --> 01:24:32,556
(CHUCKLES) So that's it.
You've been talking with Haverstock.

1260
01:24:32,676 --> 01:24:35,930
He was here this morning telling us
about Van Meer still being alive.

1261
01:24:36,054 --> 01:24:38,225
You promised Haverstock you'd
look into it, didn't you?

1262
01:24:38,251 --> 01:24:38,832
Naturally.

1263
01:24:38,932 --> 01:24:42,937
An unusual way of looking into it,
trying to have him put out of the way.

1264
01:24:43,061 --> 01:24:46,611
I realize a life or two is a small
matter, the way you work.

1265
01:24:46,732 --> 01:24:50,703
Well, the people who have got Carol
can take a leaf out of your book.

1266
01:24:52,571 --> 01:24:54,869
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

1267
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:57,539

Hello?

1270
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:10,431
I think I can get our Dutch friend
to talk if you come along.

1271
01:25:10,589 --> 01:25:14,093
Sorry to drag you here like this,
but I think it's the only way...

1272
01:25:14,218 --> 01:25:16,220
if you want to leave tomorrow.

1273
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:19,224
When you get here,
ask at the cashier's desk...

1274
01:25:19,348 --> 01:25:21,021
to use the phone.

1275
01:25:21,141 --> 01:25:23,269
They'll show you straight up.

1276
01:25:24,436 --> 01:25:27,610
Very well.
I'll drop in as soon as I can.

1277
01:25:27,731 --> 01:25:30,735
If you want Carol, you'd better
tell me where Van Meer is.

1278
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,721
Bring her back. I'll
give you the address.

1279
01:25:32,747 --> 01:25:34,479
Carol can be home
in three hours...

<i>but I want that address now.</i>

1281

You'll have it as soon
as Carol is home.

1282
01:25:38,825 --> 01:25:41,044
I can't possibly
wait three hours.

You see,
we'd been joking about it...

1310

Don't let him on, fools!
We shall all go down!

<i>It won't hold us.
I'd better slip away.</i>

1653
01:52:19,550 --> 01:52:22,850
Quickly move to the other end.
That might make it lighter here.

Look!

1658
01:53:42,591 --> 01:53:45,310
It must be the enemy
coming to pick us up.

1659
01:53:46,303 --> 01:53:47,850
Is it the enemy?

We're all right.
She's American.

1661
01:53:54,353 --> 01:53:57,653
(MAN) American ship Mohican picked
us all up, taking us back to London.

I can't tell you what happened.
We're not allowed.

I'll wire from London
in a couple of days. Bye, Franklin.

1664
01:54:03,612 --> 01:54:06,957
This is awkward. I've just been
having a dirty row with the captain.

1665
01:54:07,074 --> 01:54:09,076
The fellow insists on acting
the true-blue neutral.

1666
01:54:09,201 --> 01:54:12,171
"Enemy waters." Not a line
to the press from his ship.

1667
01:54:12,287 --> 01:54:13,482
Can't send out any stories?

1668
01:54:13,508 --> 01:54:15,987
We can only use the wireless
for private messages.

01:54:16,083 --> 01:54:19,087
"Hello, Aunt Effie. Safe aboard
the Mohican. Feeling tip-top."

1670
01:54:19,211 --> 01:54:23,762
I ask you! Two days before we get to
London, we get scooped on our own story.

1671
01:54:23,882 --> 01:54:25,993
Why don't you have a
crack at brass buttons?

1672
01:54:26,019 --> 01:54:26,956
What's the use?

1673
01:54:27,052 --> 01:54:29,521
What good will it do me?
My hands are tied.

1674
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,353
- What are you talking about?
- Carol.

1675
01:54:31,473 --> 01:54:33,271
I came 4,000 miles
to get a story.

1676
01:54:33,392 --> 01:54:35,861
I get shot at like a duck,
pushed off buildings...

1677
01:54:35,978 --> 01:54:38,731
I get the story,
and then I got to shut up.

1678
01:54:38,855 --> 01:54:42,234
What are you grinning at? I'm not
gonna throw her father up for grabs.

<i>He died like a hero to save
her and the rest of us.</i>

through my hat.</i>

1681
01:54:48,490 --> 01:54:50,538
<i>The whole point is
he was her father...</i>

<i>and I'm not gonna play
Judas to the only girl...</i>

I'm glad you've said that.
Very glad.

- You dry? You all right?
- I'm all right.

01:54:57,541 --> 01:54:59,794
I want you to send it,
the whole story.

- We'll talk about that later.
- No, please.

1687
01:55:02,129 --> 01:55:05,178
You can't help me
by protecting my father.

1688
01:55:05,299 --> 01:55:09,725
Listen, I'm in love with you. I can't hit
you with a scandal for a wedding present.

1689
01:55:09,845 --> 01:55:13,566
Johnny, my father fought
for his country his way.

1690
01:55:13,724 --> 01:55:16,603
It wasn't a straight way,
but it was a hard way.

1691
01:55:16,727 --> 01:55:19,856
And I've got to fight
for my country a hard way.

1692
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:22,654
Okay, if that's the way
you feel about it.

Hello? Hello?

Johnny Jones
calling from the Mohican.

1697
01:55:33,577 --> 01:55:37,582
What the deuce is he doing there? Wait.
Johnny wouldn't call if it wasn't a story.

1698
01:55:37,706 --> 01:55:40,209
Tell them to hold the presses.
Send Bradley in.

1699
01:55:40,334 --> 01:55:42,632
Tell him we're breaking up
page one. Hello?

1700
01:55:42,753 --> 01:55:44,755
Hello, Mr. Powers.
This is Johnny Jones.

1701
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:46,427
Easy.
Here comes the captain.

1702
01:55:49,217 --> 01:55:51,561
Mr. Powers, keep your ear
glued to this phone...

1703
01:55:51,678 --> 01:55:53,430
and don't hang up.

1704
01:55:58,935 --> 01:56:01,284
Mr. Haverstock, I
want to talk with you.

1705
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:01,964
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

1706
01:56:02,105 --> 01:56:03,877
I've just found out
you're a newspaperman.

1707
01:56:03,903 --> 01:56:04,974
I guess that's right.

1708
01:56:05,067 --> 01:56:08,037
Why didn't you tell me that
when I questioned you?

1709
01:56:08,153 --> 01:56:10,576
- You lied to me, sir.
- My dear captain...

1710
01:56:10,697 --> 01:56:13,951
when you've been shot down in
a British plane by a German destroyer...

01:56:14,117 --> 01:56:17,121
300 miles off the coast of
England... latitude 45...

to a half-submerged wing for hours...

other stricken human beings...

1714
01:56:23,126 --> 01:56:25,845
you're liable to forget
you're a newspaperman for a moment.

1715

You're gonna have to forget it
for as long as you're on this ship.

I can't understand
your attitude, sir.

You performed a heroic rescue.

<i>- That's final.</i>
- You're absolutely right, Captain.

1721

We mustn't embarrass
the United States government.

1722
01:56:43,438 --> 01:56:44,860

Yes, the same Mr. Fisher
who was drowned a few hours ago.

He was using the Peace Party
as a cover-up for spies and traitors.

<i>He was going to be arrested

Those are facts.

01:57:13,870 --> 01:57:16,998
I can't believe it. He
was a friend of mine.

know whether my friend

about Mr. Fisher.
