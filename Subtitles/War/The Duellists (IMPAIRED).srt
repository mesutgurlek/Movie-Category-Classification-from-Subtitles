TO BE A SOLDIER...

647
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:47,267
I WAS LEARNING TO MAKE BOOTS.

648
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:49,936
I'VE SUPPORTED MYSELF
AS A BOOTMAKER.

649
01:01:49,936 --> 01:01:51,938
NOW THAT I'M AN ARISTOCRAT
ONCE MORE...

650
01:01:52,439 --> 01:01:54,474
I HAVE TO DRUM UP TRADE.

651
01:01:54,474 --> 01:01:56,976
SLOTH IS THE CURSE
OF THE ARISTOCRACY.

652
01:01:56,976 --> 01:01:59,446
THE CHEVALIER FOUND YOU
VASTLY WELL READ...

653
01:01:59,446 --> 01:02:01,948
AND HE SAID YOU HAD
A VERY GOOD LEG.

654
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,452
I SOUND LIKE A HORSE.

655
01:02:05,952 --> 01:02:08,455
MY GOD, I'M LUCKY
HE DIDN'T LOOK AT MY TEETH.

656
01:02:08,455 --> 01:02:10,957
I DO HATE THAT SWEARING.

657
01:02:10,957 --> 01:02:13,460
DON'T YOU DARE DO IT
IN FRONT OF ADELE.

658
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:14,961
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

659
01:02:14,961 --> 01:02:15,462
NO, I HAVEN'T.

660
01:02:15,962 --> 01:02:17,964
YES, YOU HAVE.

661
01:02:17,964 --> 01:02:20,467
DON'T SULK. YOU HAVE.

662
01:02:20,967 --> 01:02:23,970
ISN'T THIS MARRIAGE-BROKING
GETTING OUT OF FASHION?

663
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:27,474
NOTHING SENSIBLE
GOES OUT OF FASHION.

LET ME LOOK.

669
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:13,937
VERY HANDSOME FELLOW.

670
01:03:15,221 --> 01:03:17,690
THEY HAVE GOLDEN EYES, YOU KNOW.

671
01:03:18,191 --> 01:03:19,692
AND JEWELS INSIDE THEIR HEADS?

672
01:03:19,692 --> 01:03:20,693

RATHER THAN AN OLD,
LAME CREATURE...

676
01:04:16,082 --> 01:04:18,585
I'D ASK YOU TO MARRY ME.

677
01:04:20,086 --> 01:04:22,088
WELL, DON'T YOU WANT
TO MARRY ME NOW?

678
01:04:24,591 --> 01:04:27,594
MY DEAR, WE BOTH KNOW
WHAT'S EXPECTED OF US, DON'T WE?

679
01:04:33,099 --> 01:04:35,602
IF I WERE TO NEGLECT
TO MAKE YOU A PROPOSAL...

680
01:04:35,602 --> 01:04:37,604
NO BLAME WOULD BE
ATTACHED TO YOU.

681
01:04:37,604 --> 01:04:40,607
I THINK PERHAPS
YOU MIGHT BE SAVED FROM A...

IF YOU NEGLECT
TO MAKE ME A PROPOSAL...

684
01:04:46,613 --> 01:04:48,615
MY UNCLE WILL GO MAD.

685
01:04:50,617 --> 01:04:53,620
DAMN IT, YOU WERE NOT PUT ON
THIS EARTH TO CODDLE YOUR UNCLE.

686
01:04:55,038 --> 01:04:57,540
I HAVE HEARD YOU DO SWEAR
MOST TERRIBLY.

687
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,543

I'M A TEMPERED MAN.

688
01:05:00,543 --> 01:05:03,046
TEMPERED IN MY SPEECH.

01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:10,053
I LOVE YOU.

01:05:19,062 --> 01:05:21,064
MY DEAREST ADELE...

692
01:05:22,565 --> 01:05:25,568
IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY...

693
01:05:25,568 --> 01:05:29,072
HAPPY BEYOND EXPECTATION
IF YOU WOULD BECOME MY WIFE.

694
01:05:32,075 --> 01:05:33,576
YES.

695
01:05:41,167 --> 01:05:42,669
IT WAS A FIASCO.

696
01:05:42,669 --> 01:05:43,536

699
01:05:48,508 --> 01:05:50,009
NOTHING, I SHOULD HOPE.

OH, ARMAND...

702
01:05:56,382 --> 01:06:00,386
IN MARRIAGE, EVENTS OF THAT KIND
ARE NOT IMPORTANT.

703
01:06:00,386 --> 01:06:04,390
A GOOD MARRIAGE
SETTLES DOWN QUIETLY...

01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,392
LIKE MOSS.

WORD SPOKEN ABOUT MOSS.

IF SHE'S GOOD AND BIDDABLE,
SHE'LL SETTLE DOWN.

710
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:26,412
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR.

711
01:06:26,412 --> 01:06:29,415
SHE'S YOUNG.
SHE HAS THAT MAGIC.

713
01:06:33,503 --> 01:06:35,004
YES, I'M IN LOVE.

SURELY YOU WILL NOT TURN DOWN
THE OPPORTUNITY OF A BRIGADE.

720
01:07:08,588 --> 01:07:11,591
THE EMPEROR IS OUR HOPE
AND STRENGTH.

721
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,881
WE BELONG TO HIM.

722

I HAVE ENTERTAINED
THE NOTION THAT...

723
01:07:23,886 --> 01:07:25,772
I MAY BELONG TO MYSELF.

724
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:31,778
IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT YOU
DO NOT LOVE THE EMPEROR.

725
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:34,280
BY WHOM?

726
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:36,783
BY GENERAL FERAUD.

727
01:07:36,783 --> 01:07:39,736
HE KNOWS YOU WELL,
I BELIEVE.

728
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:42,238
GENERAL FERAUD HAS MADE
OCCASIONAL ATTEMPTS TO KILL ME.

729
01:07:42,238 --> 01:07:45,541
THAT DOES NOT GIVE HIM THE RIGHT
TO CLAIM MY ACQUAINTANCE.

730
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:47,543
AND IT IS ALSO SAID
THAT HE FOUGHT YOU...

731
01:07:48,044 --> 01:07:50,580
IN DEFENSE
OF THE EMPEROR'S HONOR.

732
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,381
THAT IS IMPERTINENT TRASH!

733
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:54,751
YOU HAVE MY ANSWER
TO MARSHALL GROUCHY.

734
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,969
I SHALL WRITE
TO CONFIRM IT AT ONCE.

735
01:07:56,969 --> 01:07:59,088
GOOD DAY.

736
01:08:02,058 --> 01:08:04,310
COLONEL, DO YOU SOMETIMES
MEET WITH GENERAL FERAUD?

737
01:08:05,178 --> 01:08:06,679
NOW AND AGAIN.

738
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:08,181
ASK HIM WHAT THE HONOR
OF THE EMPEROR

739
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:09,982
HAS TO DO
WITH MADAME DE LIONNE?

740
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:12,518
MADAME DE LIONNE?

741
01:08:12,518 --> 01:08:15,404
I THINK THAT WAS
THE LADY'S NAME.

742
01:08:15,404 --> 01:08:16,906
HE SHOULD REMEMBER
BETTER THAN I.

743
01:08:25,414 --> 01:08:27,416
TELL HIM TO DRIVE ON.

744
01:08:49,772 --> 01:08:51,274
DAMN HIS IMPUDENCE.

745
01:08:51,774 --> 01:08:54,026
THAT WAS
THE LADY'S NAME, SIR.

746
01:08:54,894 --> 01:08:56,729
MADAME DE LIONNE.

747
01:08:58,698 --> 01:09:00,700
YES.

748
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,736
GET YOUR BACKSIDE
OFF THAT TABLE.

749
01:09:03,736 --> 01:09:06,122
FINE WOMAN. A CULTIVATED WOMAN.

750
01:09:06,122 --> 01:09:08,958
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE EMPEROR.

751
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:12,411
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
THE GENERAL WAS SUGGESTING...

752
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:16,799
AN ILLICIT ACQUAINTANCE BETWEEN
THE EMPEROR AND THIS WOMAN.

753
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,801
THEN WHAT WAS HE SUGGESTING?

754
01:09:19,302 --> 01:09:20,553
WHAT?
OUT WITH IT.

755
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,924
SIR, I TOOK HIM RATHER
TO IMPLY THAT THIS LADY...

756
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:28,311
NOT THE EMPEROR, WAS THE PRIME
CAUSE OF YOUR QUARREL.

757
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:32,265
I HAVE CALLED HIM OUT NEAR
TO HALF A DOZEN TIMES.

758
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:33,266
THE CAVALRY KNOWS.

759
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:36,018
WOULD I HAVE DONE THAT
FOR SOME PETTY NONSENSE?

760
01:09:36,519 --> 01:09:38,521
SHE WAS A LADY I HELD
IN HIGH ESTEEM.

761
01:09:38,521 --> 01:09:40,356
HER SALON
WAS VERY WELL KNOWN IN...

762
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:42,775
STRASBOURG.

763
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:48,030
YES, NOW I RECALL
SOMETHING ELSE.

764
01:09:50,032 --> 01:09:51,784
HE SAID TO ME
IN A PUBLIC STREET--

765
01:09:51,784 --> 01:09:54,170
I HAVE IT BURNT IN MY MIND.
HE SAID TO ME...

766
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:57,456
"FOR ALL THAT I CARE, THEY CAN
SPIT UPON NAPOLEON BONAPARTE."

767
01:09:58,841 --> 01:09:59,926
WHO WERE THEY?

768
01:09:59,926 --> 01:10:00,927
THEY, THEY!

769
01:10:00,927 --> 01:10:02,929
WHEN DID THE EMPEROR
NOT HAVE ENEMIES?

770
01:10:02,929 --> 01:10:05,431
D'HUBERT IS A TURNCOAT!
THAT IS A FACT!

771
01:10:05,431 --> 01:10:08,434
I SAY MORE. I SAY HE NEVER
LOVED THE EMPEROR! NEVER!

772
01:10:12,271 --> 01:10:15,107
HE SAW A FAIR DEAL
OF CAMPAIGNING.

773
01:10:17,476 --> 01:10:19,478
WHEN YOU MEET HIM, TELL HIM
I WILL PROVE THE TRUTH OF IT...

774
01:10:19,478 --> 01:10:22,481
AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY.

775
01:10:22,481 --> 01:10:26,369

AND TO THOSE THAT LOVE HIM.

778
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:35,544
AND I OFFER YOU
ANOTHER TOAST.

779
01:10:35,544 --> 01:10:38,547
LET US GIVE THANKS
FOR THE SAFE RETURN...

780
01:10:38,547 --> 01:10:42,051
OF HIS SACRED MAJESTY,
LOUIS XVIII.

781

GOD SAVE THE KING.

782
01:10:44,053 --> 01:10:46,555
All: GOD SAVE THE KING.

783
01:10:48,557 --> 01:10:50,559
AND DEVIL TAKE THE OGRE...

784
01:10:50,559 --> 01:10:52,561
TO ST. HELENA.

785
01:10:54,563 --> 01:10:59,068
THIS SIDE OF THE GRAVE, IT SEEMS
A FIT AND PROPER PLACE FOR HIM.

786
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:02,071
COME, SIR.
YOU'RE A ROYALIST NOW...

787
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:03,990
LIKE THE REST OF US.

788
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,325
WHERE ELSE
WOULD YOU WISH HIM TO BE?

789
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,496
ONE CELEBRATION AT A TIME, SIR.
DON'T YOU THINK?

790
01:11:10,496 --> 01:11:13,165
NO, I DO NOT.
THE BOY'S A ROYALIST.

791
01:11:13,165 --> 01:11:15,785
AND I CAN GIVE YOU
MORE GOOD NEWS.

792
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:20,706
HE HAS BEEN SUMMONED TO ATTEND
UPON MARSHALL ST. CYR IN PARIS.

793
01:11:21,207 --> 01:11:24,710
HE WILL HAVE A COMMAND
IN THE KING'S ARMY.

794
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:28,214
SO TELL US. WHAT FATE
WOULD YOU CHOOSE FOR THE OGRE?

795
01:11:31,434 --> 01:11:33,686
I BELIEVE THE EMPEROR
CHOSE HIS OWN FATE.

796
01:11:33,686 --> 01:11:35,855
IT WAS HIS HABIT TO DO SO.

797
01:11:37,723 --> 01:11:40,693
I LEARNED MY TRADE
IN HIS SERVICE,

798
01:11:40,693 --> 01:11:42,695
AS DID MARSHALL ST. CYR.

799
01:11:42,695 --> 01:11:45,481
THE KING'S ARMY WILL HAVE
MORE REALISTS THAN ROYALISTS.

800
01:11:51,037 --> 01:11:53,539
I HAVE JUST AGREED TO TERMS
WITH THIS LADY...

801
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,542

01:12:11,757 --> 01:12:13,259
WELL DONE.

804
01:12:17,096 --> 01:12:19,899
[ BELL CHIMING ]

805
01:12:44,423 --> 01:12:45,758
GOOD DAY, COLONEL.

806
01:12:48,177 --> 01:12:49,428
D'HUBERT, ISN'T IT?

807
01:12:49,428 --> 01:12:51,213
THAT'S RIGHT.

808
01:12:54,133 --> 01:12:57,136
YOU TOOK CARE
TO PLAY SAFE, EH?

809
01:12:58,637 --> 01:13:00,473
VERY SPRUCE YOU LOOK TOO.

810
01:13:00,473 --> 01:13:04,393
VERY TAME AND SPRUCE.

811
01:13:04,894 --> 01:13:07,730
FOUND A NICE PLACE
WITH HIS MAJESTY, HAVE YOU?

812
01:13:09,148 --> 01:13:11,650
NOW, GABRIEL FERAUD WAS RIGHT.

813
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:13,652
POOR DEVIL.

814
01:13:15,154 --> 01:13:17,656
HE ALWAYS SAID
YOU WERE A SLIPPERY FELLOW.

815
01:13:18,574 --> 01:13:21,410
HOW IS GENERAL FERAUD?

816
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:22,628
YOU DON'T KNOW?

817
01:13:22,628 --> 01:13:24,964
IT INTERESTS ME VERY LITTLE.

818
01:13:24,964 --> 01:13:26,749
IN FACT, I DO NOT KNOW.

819
01:13:26,749 --> 01:13:30,052
FERAUD WAS ARRESTED.

820
01:13:30,052 --> 01:13:32,221
THEY HAVE HIM
ON THE BUTCHER'S LIST.

821
01:13:33,722 --> 01:13:35,508
HE'S TO GO BEFORE
THE SPECIAL COMMISSION?

822
01:13:36,008 --> 01:13:37,009
YES.

823
01:13:37,009 --> 01:13:38,511
NOW, THERE WAS A MAN

824
01:13:38,511 --> 01:13:41,013
WHO WOULD RIDE
STRAIGHT AT ANYTHING.

825
01:13:43,516 --> 01:13:47,019
HE ENDS UP AT THE MERCY
OF THAT SEWER RAT.

826
01:13:48,521 --> 01:13:49,522
FOUCHE.

827
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:53,492
HE'S AS GOOD AS DEAD.

828
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:38,154
COME A LITTLE CLOSER, PLEASE.
I'M ALL ATTENTION.

829
01:14:47,546 --> 01:14:50,049
I BELIEVE YOUR EXCELLENCY
HAS CHOSEN A LIST OF OFFICERS...

830
01:14:50,049 --> 01:14:52,051
TO BE TRIED FOR TREASON
BY THE SPECIAL COURT.

831
01:14:53,052 --> 01:14:54,553
I...

832
01:14:55,054 --> 01:14:56,555
AM THE PRESIDENT OF
THE COMMISSION

833
01:14:56,555 --> 01:14:57,556
THAT CHOSE THEM, YES.

834
01:14:59,558 --> 01:15:00,559
I'VE COME TO PETITION

835
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:02,561
THAT THE NAME
OF GENERAL GABRIEL FERAUD...

836
01:15:02,561 --> 01:15:04,563
BE REMOVED FROM THAT LIST.

837
01:15:05,064 --> 01:15:08,484
I HAVE LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION--
MARSHALLS ST. CYR AND MacDONALD.

838
01:15:08,484 --> 01:15:10,486
HAVE YOU INDEED?

839
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:15,491
BY ALL ACCOUNTS,
HE IS A RABID BONAPARTIST.

840
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:18,994
SO IS EVERY TROOPER
AND GRENADIER IN THE ARMY...

841
01:15:18,994 --> 01:15:20,746
AS YOUR EXCELLENCY KNOWS.

842
01:15:20,746 --> 01:15:22,615
GENERAL FERAUD
HASN'T THE BRAINS

843
01:15:23,115 --> 01:15:25,117
TO MAKE HIMSELF DANGEROUS
TO ANYONE.

844
01:15:26,619 --> 01:15:28,921
RATHER, HE COULD NOT
CONCEIVABLY HURT THE STATE.

845
01:15:28,921 --> 01:15:31,840
HE HAS A BUSY TONGUE.

846
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,842
HE TALKED HIMSELF
ON TO OUR LIST.

847
01:15:33,842 --> 01:15:35,177
WE COULD NOT KEEP HIM OFF IT.

848
01:15:45,471 --> 01:15:49,475
I AM SOMETHING OF A VIRTUOSO
IN SURVIVAL.

849
01:15:49,475 --> 01:15:51,777
YOU WILL BE AWARE OF THAT,
I THINK.

850
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:57,283
BESIDES,
I DESPISE THESE NOBODIES...

851
01:15:57,283 --> 01:15:59,618
WHO OFFER THEIR NECK
TO THE BLOCK.

852
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:05,124
AT LEAST HE'S IN MY CONTROL,
BECAUSE IF IT WERE NOT...

853
01:16:05,124 --> 01:16:07,626
MY OWN MEN WOULD MOST CERTAINLY
BE ON IT.

854
01:16:07,626 --> 01:16:10,629
OUR NEW MASTERS
AND THEIR LADIES, BLESS THEM...

855
01:16:10,629 --> 01:16:12,631
ARE OUT FOR A DEAL OF BLOOD.

856
01:16:13,132 --> 01:16:14,633
PLEASE BE SEATED.

857
01:16:22,258 --> 01:16:24,760
YOU HAVE AN HONEST
SOLDIER'S FACE, GENERAL...

858
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,763
BUT YOU HAVE COME HERE
TO INTRIGUE WITH ME.

859
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:30,015
IS THAT NOT SO?

860
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:33,736
HAVE YOU NOT COME HERE
TO INTRIGUE WITH ME?

861
01:16:35,187 --> 01:16:37,990
IS THIS FELLOW
A RELATION OF YOURS?

862
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,408
NO.

863
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:42,911
INTIMATE FRIEND?

864
01:16:43,412 --> 01:16:45,414
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

865
01:16:45,414 --> 01:16:49,418
WE'VE HAD A...
LONG ASSOCIATION.

866
01:16:49,418 --> 01:16:51,453
MYSTERIOUS.

867
01:16:51,954 --> 01:16:55,958
STILL YOU HAVE
TWO MARSHALS AT YOUR BACK.

868
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:08,304
YES, THERE'S YOUR MAN.
FERAUD, GABRIEL FLORIAN.

869
01:17:10,306 --> 01:17:12,808
HE WILL LIVE IN THE PROVINCES
UNDER POLICE SUPERVISION.

870
01:17:12,808 --> 01:17:15,811
YOU REALIZE THAT, OF COURSE.

871
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:17,313
BUT HE WILL LIVE.

872
01:17:22,318 --> 01:17:24,820
TAKE A PEN, MY DEAR FELLOW,
AND CROSS OUT THE NAME.

873
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:26,705
I CAN'T DO EVERYTHING FOR YOU.

874
01:17:36,048 --> 01:17:37,549
YOUR EXCELLENCY, I MUST BEG YOU

875
01:17:37,549 --> 01:17:39,551
TO KEEP MY INTERFERENCE
A SECRET.

876
01:17:39,551 --> 01:17:41,553
MOST PARTICULARLY
FROM GENERAL FERAUD.

877
01:17:45,974 --> 01:17:50,346
GENERAL FERAUD, ALIVE OR DEAD,
IS NOT WORTH A MOMENT'S GOSSIP.

878
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,609
[ TICKING ]

879
01:18:48,954 --> 01:18:51,957

THERE. GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

880
01:18:58,964 --> 01:19:01,967
SIR, KICK FOR THE GENERAL.

881
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:07,473
[ GROANS ] THERE.

882
01:19:07,473 --> 01:19:09,475
PERFECT DISCIPLINE.

883
01:19:09,475 --> 01:19:12,478
THAT'S NOT A GRENADIER.

884
01:19:12,478 --> 01:19:14,980
MOST LADYLIKE,
I ASSURE YOU.

885
01:19:16,482 --> 01:19:18,484
HE'SNOT KICKINGYOU.

886
01:19:39,671 --> 01:19:41,673
GENERAL.

887
01:19:42,174 --> 01:19:44,676
THE FELLOW IN THE CAVALRY
YOU CALLED OUT SEVERAL TIMES--

888
01:19:45,177 --> 01:19:47,429
D'HUBERT, WASN'T IT?

889
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:50,682
"GENERAL D'HUBERT, WHO'S BEEN
ON SICK LEAVE IN THE SOUTH...

890
01:19:51,183 --> 01:19:53,685
IS TO TAKE COMMAND
OF THE FIFTH CAVALRY BRIGADE...

891
01:19:53,685 --> 01:19:55,637
AT REIMS."

892
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:02,644
SAME FELLOW, ISN'T IT?

893
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:37,513
GOOD DAY.

894
01:20:37,513 --> 01:20:39,014
GOOD DAY.

895
01:20:39,014 --> 01:20:41,016
GOOD DAY.

896
01:20:41,517 --> 01:20:44,019
SIR, I WONDER,
COULD YOU DIRECT US...

897
01:20:44,019 --> 01:20:48,440
TO THE RESIDENCE
OF GENERAL ARMAND D'HUBERT?

898
01:20:48,941 --> 01:20:50,442
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT WITH HIM?

899
01:20:50,943 --> 01:20:52,444
I WANT A QUIET WORD
WITH HIM.

900
01:20:52,444 --> 01:20:54,446
CONFIDENTIAL,
YOU UNDERSTAND.

901
01:20:56,448 --> 01:20:58,333
THIS PLACE IS QUIET ENOUGH.

902
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:00,335
YOU AREN'T THE GENERAL,
ARE YOU, SIR, BY ANY CHANCE?

903
01:21:00,836 --> 01:21:01,837
YES, SIR, I AM.

904
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:03,338
I THOUGHT SO.

905
01:21:03,338 --> 01:21:05,340
MET YOU ONCE AFTER RATISBON.

906
01:21:07,843 --> 01:21:09,845
WELL, SIR,
ALL WE NEED FOR THE PRESENT

907
01:21:10,345 --> 01:21:11,847
ARE THE NAMES OF YOUR FRIENDS.

908
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:12,681
WHAT FRIENDS?

909
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:14,883
WE ARE THE FRIENDS
OF GEN. FERAUD.

910
01:21:16,969 --> 01:21:19,471
WE'LL NEED TO WORK
PRETTY SHARP.

911
01:21:19,471 --> 01:21:21,940
POLICE SURVEILLANCE.

912
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:24,943
THEY KEEP US BOTTLED UP
AT VATAN.

913
01:21:24,943 --> 01:21:26,445
DAMN THEIR EYES.

914
01:21:26,445 --> 01:21:29,948
SLIP OUT, SLIP BACK.
NO ONE THE WISER.

915
01:21:29,948 --> 01:21:32,951
RISKY, OF COURSE,
BUT HONOR BEFORE EVERYTHING.

916
01:21:32,951 --> 01:21:34,620
HONOR FIRST.

917
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:38,624
I COULD HAVE YOU
BOTH CARTED BACK
WHERE YOU COME FROM IN IRONS.

918
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:42,628
I SWEAR TO GOD, I COULD WHISPER,
ONLY WHISPER...

919
01:21:42,628 --> 01:21:45,631
AND YOU'D BOTH BE DEAD
IN A DITCH BEFORE MORNING.

920
01:21:45,631 --> 01:21:49,635
THIS IS ROYALIST COUNTRY.
THIS IS MY HOME.

921
01:21:49,635 --> 01:21:51,637
WE HAVE PROCEEDED ON
THE ASSUMPTION

922
01:21:51,637 --> 01:21:53,138
THAT YOU WERE
A GENTLEMAN.

923
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:57,009
YES, DAMN YOU.
DAMN YOU, I AM!

924
01:21:57,009 --> 01:21:58,477
VERY WELL, THEN.

925
01:21:58,477 --> 01:22:01,813
WE'D LIKE TO KNOW
YOUR FRIENDS' NAMES.

926
01:22:01,813 --> 01:22:05,817
I HAVE NO FRIENDS STUPID ENOUGH
TO TAKE PART IN SUCH A FARCE.

927
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:11,323
I SUPPOSE I COULD ACT FOR HIM.

928
01:22:13,742 --> 01:22:15,744
HE COULD ACT FOR YOU.

929
01:22:20,115 --> 01:22:22,417
NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL
A STEADY FELLOW.

930
01:22:22,417 --> 01:22:24,336
USED TO TAKE
A STEADY FELLOW

931
01:22:24,336 --> 01:22:25,337
TO COMMAND A BRIGADE.

932
01:22:25,837 --> 01:22:29,174
I DON'T SUPPOSE GENERAL FERAUD
WOULD ACCEPT AN APOLOGY.

933
01:22:29,174 --> 01:22:32,044
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

934
01:22:32,044 --> 01:22:34,046
YOU COULD DECLARE YOURSELF
UNFIT TO BE A SOLDIER

935
01:22:34,046 --> 01:22:35,047
AND RESIGN YOUR COMMAND.

936
01:22:35,047 --> 01:22:37,049
THAT MIGHT DO IT.

937
01:22:37,049 --> 01:22:39,051
IT WOULDN'T DO.

938
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:43,355
THE GENERAL HAS RECEIVED
TOO DEEP AN INJURY.

939
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:45,641
I SEE.

940
01:22:48,143 --> 01:22:52,648
I WILL MEET YOU TOMORROW
AT SUNRISE, HERE.

941
01:22:52,648 --> 01:22:54,149
SABERS, WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE.

942
01:22:55,117 --> 01:22:56,368
PISTOLS.

943
01:22:58,203 --> 01:22:59,705
PISTOLS?

944
01:23:12,918 --> 01:23:14,920
Adele: ARE YOU COMING
TO BED NOW?

945
01:23:17,756 --> 01:23:21,176
I SHALL BE LATE.
I HAVE SOME WORK TO DO.

946
01:24:01,767 --> 01:24:03,268
MY DEAR BOY.

947
01:24:03,268 --> 01:24:05,771
I'M VERY SORRY.
DID I DISTURB YOU?

948
01:24:06,271 --> 01:24:09,024
NO.
I WAS AWAKE.

949
01:24:09,024 --> 01:24:12,310
I PROMISED THESE
FOR TOMORROW MORNING.

950
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:15,814
A TRADESMAN HAS TO KEEP
HIS WORD.

951
01:24:15,814 --> 01:24:17,816
YOU OUGHT NOT
TO TIRE YOURSELF.

952
01:24:17,816 --> 01:24:21,319
OH, I'M AN OLD MAN.
AWAKE AT ODD TIMES.

953
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:23,321
ASLEEP AT ODD TIMES.

954
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:25,824
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE UP.

955
01:24:25,824 --> 01:24:27,659
IS SOMETHING THE MATTER?

956
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:29,161
NO.

957
01:24:29,661 --> 01:24:32,164
I HAVE SOME WORK
TO DO BEFORE MORNING

958
01:24:32,164 --> 01:24:33,165
TO KEEP MY WORD.

959
01:24:39,671 --> 01:24:40,672
MAY I?

960
01:24:40,672 --> 01:24:42,674
YES, DO.

961
01:24:43,675 --> 01:24:44,559
GOOD NIGHT.

962
01:24:44,559 --> 01:24:46,061
