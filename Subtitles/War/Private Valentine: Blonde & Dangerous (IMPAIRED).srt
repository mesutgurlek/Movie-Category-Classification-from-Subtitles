God, I miss those.

308
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,570
(ALL SCREAMING)

309
00:17:26,457 --> 00:17:29,926
Recruits.
Army Senior Drill Sarge,
Sergeant Mills Evans.

310
00:17:29,994 --> 00:17:32,929
You've arrived at Fort
Jackson. You will not
speak unless spoken to.

311
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:34,380
You will obey
each word I say.

312
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:36,282
When I say go,
you will exit

313
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:38,851
and immediately place
your feet on the yellow
footprint formation.

314
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:41,654
Go, go, go, go!
Move, move, move, move!

315
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:44,341
Get your bags and go.
Move, move, move, move!

316
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,008
Come on!
EVANS: You forget something
for a dance tonight?

317
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:48,894
Get off my bus.
Move, move!

318
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:50,830
Okay. Okay.
- Get off my bus.

319
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:53,149
Let's go! Move it!

320
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:57,320
Princess Buttercup.
Move your feet.
Move your feet, Petunia.

321
00:17:57,387 --> 00:17:59,155
Hey, say it,
don't spray it.

322
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:01,308
Move, move, move.
Move those feet.

323
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,042
Move, move, move!

324
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:07,531
Yes.

325
00:18:07,598 --> 00:18:10,033
You better get
your S-H-I-T
consolidated ASAP

326
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:13,302
or you will be SOL PDQ.
Do you understand me?

327
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,503
No. I have no idea
what he just said.

328
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:15,638
SOLDIER 1: This is
not a slumber party.

329
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:16,772
Get your game face on!

330
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,025
This is so not my vibe.

331
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:22,495
What happened to, like,
the cute little rock climbing
outfits and the sisterhood?

332
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:26,248
You will stand at attention!
Put your bag down!

333
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:28,417
Shoulders back!
Eyes front!

334
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:29,518
SOLDIER 2: Look at me!

335
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:30,920
Now, when I address you,

336
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,606
your response to me will
be, "Yes, Drill Sergeant."

337
00:18:33,674 --> 00:18:34,907
Do you understand?

338
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:36,660
Why didn't you tell me
my mascara was running?

339
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:38,378
Now say it like
you got a pair.

340
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:40,981
ALL: Yes, Drill Sergeant.

341
00:18:41,016 --> 00:18:42,683
Here. This will
take the edge off.

342
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,018
What do you think this
is, a rehab facility?

343
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:47,254
I don't do drugs!
My body's a temple!

344
00:18:47,322 --> 00:18:52,676
Did you think that bus
was going to a Phish
concert? Put that away!

345
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:56,781
Now, listen up.
This is your First
Sergeant, Louisa Morley.

346
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:59,516
She'll be overseeing
your training here
at Fort Jackson.

347
00:18:59,584 --> 00:19:02,586
You will address
her as First Sergeant.

348
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:07,508
Certainly have hit a new low,
haven't we, Sergeant Evans?

349
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:09,209
Yes, First Sergeant.

350
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,347
Name, soldier.

351
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:14,448
Jeter, First Sergeant.

352
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:16,434
Don't I know you?

353
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:19,186
Proudly served
as sergeant at
Fort Benning.

354
00:19:19,254 --> 00:19:21,688
Traded my stripes
in for marriage.

355
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:24,258
That fell through.

356
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:27,427
Came back for the
love of my country,
First Sergeant!

357
00:19:27,495 --> 00:19:30,730
A woman scorned is
a good soldier.

358
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:32,516
Welcome back,
Private Jeter.

359
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:39,190
What's your name?

360
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:40,624
Ma'am, Petrovich, ma'am.

361
00:19:40,692 --> 00:19:44,444
"Ma'am"? I worked hard
for my rank, Private.

362
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:47,097
You will address me
as First Sergeant.

363
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,265
Are we clear?

364
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,417
Yes, First Sergeant.

365
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:51,869
Are you about to cry?

366
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:55,456
Ain't no crying in
the Army, baby girl.

367
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:58,442
'Cause I ain't got time
to be changing no diapers.
Are we clear?

368
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,310
Yes, First Sergeant.

369
00:20:03,449 --> 00:20:04,483
Oh!

370
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,084
Did I just catch you
eyeballing me?

371
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,019
No, First Sergeant.

372
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:11,573
Am I attractive to you?

373
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:14,159
'Cause I'll only break
your heart, sweetheart.

374
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:27,622
Name, soldier.

375
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:29,307
Private Castillo,
First Sergeant.

376
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:33,995
What are you?
Huh? You some kind
of gangbanger?

377
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:39,000
What you gonna do?
What, you gonna
cut me, mommy?

378
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:41,970
Is that what you gonna do?
You gonna cut me?

379
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,556
No, First Sergeant.

380
00:20:44,624 --> 00:20:48,876
I got my eye on
you, Casti-ho.

381
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:53,198
This is the
United States Army.

382
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:56,184
We will tolerate
nothing but...

383
00:20:56,252 --> 00:21:00,872
Excuse me? Excuse me? Hi.

384
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,493
This is really embarrassing.
Sorry to interrupt,
but I'm Megan Valentine.

385
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:06,794
Mmm-hmm.

386
00:21:07,696 --> 00:21:08,763
The actress?

387
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:09,781
Hey.

388
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,200
(CLEARS THROAT)

389
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:14,302
See, this really isn't
what I was picturing

390
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,838
when the recruitery
guy was telling me
about me finding myself.

391
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:22,260
Really? Well,
come on over here a
second, sweetheart.

392
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:24,762
But first, who
are you wearing?

393
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,498
(CHUCKLES)
Dolce and Gabbana.

394
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:27,800
Ah!

395
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:30,019
Stunning. Stunning.

396
00:21:30,086 --> 00:21:31,771
Thanks.

397
00:21:31,838 --> 00:21:36,025
It looks like we've got
ourself a special visitor
today. Megan Valentine.

398
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:39,328
Why don't we all
give her a round of
applause? Come on!

399
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,096
Come on.
No, you all can do
better than that.

400
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:42,765
Let's hear it for
Megan Valentine.

401
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,133
Hi.

402
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,870
Let's hear it for Megan.
She's just pretty as a peach.

403
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:52,307
Thank you.
Between us girls,

404
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,278
I need a bath,
a phone and, like,
20 hours of sleep.

405
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:57,146
Do you know any cute,
like, B and B's around here?

406
00:21:57,214 --> 00:21:58,281
Let me think.
Bed and breakfast?

407
00:21:58,348 --> 00:21:59,582
Yeah.

408
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,319
Nearby. And you'll probably
need a ride too, huh?

409
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:04,953
You're a doll.

410
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,522
Well, then
by all means,

411
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,425
let me ride you,
Miss Daisy.

412
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:11,376
Drop and give me 10.

413
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:13,512
Ten what?

414
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,731
Ten push-ups.
Drop and give me 10!

415
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,985
Will you hold
my bag? Thanks.

416
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:23,339
I think I wanna take
the scenic route, Evans.

417
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:25,424
My grandmother can
do a better push-up
than that.

418
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:28,795
Off your knees. This isn't
the Girl Scouts! Now, down.

419
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:30,997
I said, feet back. Down!

420
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:32,231
I'm trying.

421
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:35,367
Up! Down.

422
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:38,470
Up. Down. Hold it
when I say down.

423
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:43,910
Down. Up. Down. Up.

424
00:22:43,977 --> 00:22:48,480
Down. Up. Down. Up.

425
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,854
Down. Up. Down. Up.

426
00:22:53,922 --> 00:22:55,588
Get up, Hollywood!
Get up!

427
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:56,890
Okay.

428
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:01,394
As you can see,
I'm a huge fan.
Really, I am.

429
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:04,998
But we just seem to have
a teeny weeny problem here.

430
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:09,185
You see right here?
Like the VIP, girlfriend,
you on the list.

431
00:23:09,253 --> 00:23:14,391
So as long as your
name is on my list,
you're not going anywhere.

432
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,544
Fall in for processing.
There you go, cuteness.

433
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:19,479
<i>Hey, this is Sidney.</i>
<i>Call me on the cell,</i>
<i>call me at the office,</i>

434
00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:21,348
<i>I'm always open.</i>

435
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:24,717
Sidney, it's me.
I made a mistake.
I need your help.

436
00:23:24,785 --> 00:23:29,489
I crashed my car and now
I'm at the Army and
everyone's yelling at me.

437
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:33,626
Come on, you know
how much that tube
of eye cream goes for?

438
00:23:33,694 --> 00:23:36,963
No, not the Libra.
I have been on
a waiting list.

439
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:39,532
These are on loan.

440
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,270
One size fits all?
Am I being  <i>Punk'd?</i>

441
00:23:43,337 --> 00:23:46,072
C-D-N-K...

442
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:48,341
Oh!

443
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:50,710
That's so wrong.

444
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:52,678
I don't wear
underwear.

445
00:23:53,547 --> 00:23:55,648
When is this gonna end?

446
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:57,784
(SHOUTING)

447
00:23:57,851 --> 00:23:59,820
This is just the beginning!

448
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:07,126
Gosh. Where's my room?

449
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,396
These sheets better have
a decent thread count.

450
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,281
Can you believe that?
She just sees a tattoo

451
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,416
and just assumes I'm
in a gang or something.

452
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:30,535
(GRUNTS)

453
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,388
I hate that I let her
make me cry.

454
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:34,989
(SIGHS) Thank God.

It's 5:00 a.m. Time
to fall in for duty.

457
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:51,372
Let's go. Let's go.

Private Valentine,
you're dismissed.
Move out!

775
00:42:47,828 --> 00:42:52,565
You will all do 10 more
minutes to make up for
Valentine's failure.

776
00:42:55,218 --> 00:42:56,686
Can I ask
you something,
Valentine?

777
00:42:56,753 --> 00:42:58,754
If you promise
not to yell it.

778
00:42:58,822 --> 00:43:03,192
You have the kind of
success that other people
can only dream about.

779
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,778
But you approach everything
you do like you're gonna fail.

780
00:43:06,997 --> 00:43:08,581
I don't get that.

781
00:43:08,649 --> 00:43:11,651
I'm not you and I'm
not your grandmother.

782
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:14,187
It's just a
figure of speech.

783
00:43:14,254 --> 00:43:16,422
My grandmother lives
in a retirement
home down in Florida.

784
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,108
Oh!

785
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,561
And the truth is
I almost didn't
make it through Basic.

786
00:43:22,629 --> 00:43:25,882
When your dad's a General,
you stick out a little.

787
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:30,252
Actually, a lot.
It becomes a sport. Who can
break the General's kid?

788
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,722
But you made it.
Good for you.

789
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,374
It's been this sergeant's
experience that every soldier
that makes it through

790
00:43:35,442 --> 00:43:37,643
ends up finding they have
much more inside themselves

791
00:43:37,711 --> 00:43:39,028
than they ever
thought possible.

792
00:43:39,095 --> 00:43:40,698
You think that's true for me?

793
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:41,665
No.

794
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:46,153
Yes. I do.

795
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:48,772
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.

796
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,625
I will never be
without my rifle.

797
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:54,628
I will never be
without my rifle.

798
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:56,279
I will never be
without my rifle.

799
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:58,332
MORLEY: I can't
hear you. You what?

800
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,234
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.

801
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,921
I will never be
without my rifle.

802
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:05,539
I need it a
little bit louder.

be without my rifle.

Private Valentine.
You were dismissed.

805
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:15,215
First Sergeant,
dismissed decided to not
let her platoon down.

806

You owe me one,
Valentine.

807
00:44:20,705 --> 00:44:22,523
Yes, First Sergeant.

808

without my rifle.

809

be without my rifle.

810
00:44:26,945 --> 00:44:28,178
One more time.

811
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:29,746
ALL: I will never
be without my rifle.

812

I'm adjusting your strike.

817

JOHNSON: Don't hurt
yourself, Valentine.

818
00:45:08,804 --> 00:45:10,305
Okay. You're
driving me crazy.

819
00:45:10,372 --> 00:45:11,522
Move over.
This goes over...

820
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,024
No, no. Castillo.

821
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:15,009
Castillo, I can
do it on my own.

822
00:45:17,212 --> 00:45:19,080
Nice to see you
relaxing, Jeter.

823
00:45:19,147 --> 00:45:21,349
298, 299...

824
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,304
Just finished 300 Kegels,
First Sergeant.

825
00:45:27,372 --> 00:45:30,207
Kegels? 300?

826
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,279
Well, then by all means,
at ease, Private.

827
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:36,948
Shake it off.
Shake it off.

828
00:45:39,568 --> 00:45:41,870
Aside from Jeter,

829
00:45:41,937 --> 00:45:46,624
this is the worst excuse
for a platoon these gorgeous
eyes have ever seen.

What the hell is that?

832
00:45:57,686 --> 00:45:59,537
Whose rifle is this?

833
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,657
It's mine,
First Sergeant.

834
00:46:06,596 --> 00:46:11,566
Hollywood, what
is your rifle doing
out of the rack?

835
00:46:11,634 --> 00:46:15,586
Rifle wanted to cuddle,
First Sergeant. We made up.

836
00:46:15,654 --> 00:46:17,839
Getting cute again,
Valentine?

837
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:20,725
Well, let me tell you
what I think is cute.

838
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:28,217
You on the floor with
a toothbrush scrubbing
down the filthy latrine.

839
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:32,138
That'll be one clean,
mean, fighting latrine,
First Sergeant.

840
00:46:33,606 --> 00:46:35,107
It better be.

841
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:45,618
Why did you do that?

842
00:46:45,685 --> 00:46:48,203
I can't stand it when
she treats you like that.

843
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:50,139
I know.
I can't help it.

844
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:53,108
Something happens
and I just freeze.
I don't know what to do.

845
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:57,013
Who's the toughest,
meanest, craziest
person you can think of?

846
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:00,266
Joe Pesci?
- Perfect.

847
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:03,969
So next time she comes up
to you like that, all you
have to do is channel Pesci.

848
00:47:04,036 --> 00:47:04,786
You wanna try it?
- Yeah.

849
00:47:04,854 --> 00:47:06,204
Okay.

850
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:14,479
Baby girl, you gonna cry? Huh?
You gonna cry? You gonna cry?

851
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:18,600
No, no, no. Don't cry.
Don't cry. You're not
supposed to cry.

852
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,703
What would Pesci do?

853
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:21,804
I don't know.

854
00:47:22,872 --> 00:47:25,123
This is what
Pesci would do.

855
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:33,098
Do I look like a
fricking clown to you?
Do I amuse you?

856
00:47:34,467 --> 00:47:35,551
Try it.

857
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:36,602

laughing at?

You'll get it.
Just keep practicing.

861
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,817
Ladies,
I have a latrine to clean.

looking at?

you did for Petrovich.

Thanks.

865

Hey, Johnson, can
I ask you something?

866
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,152
(SCOFFS)
Do I have a choice?

867
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,887
You really couldn't
get a job?

868
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:13,690
Oh! I can get a job,
just not a good one.

869
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:17,093
Technology is changing
every day and I need
to go back to school

870
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:21,047
and, of course, I can't
afford it. Times are tough.

871
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:27,020
But the military's
gonna give me a job,
train me in my field.

872

And, damn it,
I will make a better life
for me and my daughter.

Yeah.

My family really helped
me out after her father
died. All this is for her.

877
00:48:42,536 --> 00:48:43,953
I have a niece

know her, though.

drifted apart when my whole
acting career started.

01:01:17,416 --> 01:01:18,350
No.

1085
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:19,968
And if I wanted reality,

1086
01:01:20,035 --> 01:01:21,519
I would stay home
and look at my ass
in the mirror.

1087
01:01:21,587 --> 01:01:23,988
When I go to a movie,
I wanna laugh.

1088
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:25,573
Maybe you're right.

1089
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:28,610
Okay, so,
Megan, I mean,
cough it up.

1090
01:01:28,677 --> 01:01:32,129
You have everything
anyone could ever
possibly want.

1091
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:35,466
Why are you
really here?

1092
01:01:35,334 --> 01:01:40,622
My manager, Nigel, he
found me when I pretty
much had nothing.

1093
01:01:40,689 --> 01:01:45,260
And he told me what to wear,
what to say, how to act.

1094
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:49,765
Pretty much made me
a star. He was like
a father to me, really.

1095
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:53,102
Did he die?

1096
01:01:53,169 --> 01:01:55,203
No, he slept
with my boyfriend.

1097
01:01:56,189 --> 01:01:57,957
Damn.
ALL: Ouch!

1098
01:01:58,024 --> 01:02:00,543
My cousin Barry stole
all of my money.

1099
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:03,245
So, I'm broke.

1100
01:02:04,448 --> 01:02:06,381
Wow.
- Ouch.

1101
01:02:06,449 --> 01:02:08,150
MEGAN: It's a good thing.

1102
01:02:08,218 --> 01:02:11,020
For the first
time in my life,
I'm my own person.

1103
01:02:12,406 --> 01:02:13,672
And I have
real friends.

1104
01:02:16,326 --> 01:02:17,726
You really mean that?

1105
01:02:17,794 --> 01:02:18,911
I promise.

1106
01:02:20,163 --> 01:02:21,897
Aw!

1107
01:02:21,965 --> 01:02:23,615
Okay.

1108
01:02:23,683 --> 01:02:25,784
Okay. Let's
open another one.

1109
01:02:25,852 --> 01:02:27,136
This one is from
Delores Bagoni.

1110
01:02:27,204 --> 01:02:28,237
ALL: Ooh!

1111
01:02:28,305 --> 01:02:30,039
That's my personal assistant.

1112
01:02:35,278 --> 01:02:39,014
"Megan, thank you
for realizing how hard it
is to take care of you.

1113
01:02:39,081 --> 01:02:41,717
"Sometimes, I want
to slit my wrists."

1114
01:02:41,818 --> 01:02:43,786
God.

1115
01:02:43,853 --> 01:02:47,690
"I did a little investigating
like you asked. I hope this
is what you are looking for."

1116
01:02:51,844 --> 01:02:53,779
Thank you, Delores.

1117
01:03:02,038 --> 01:03:04,890
You're now entering the
final stages of training.

(ALL CHEERING)

1119
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:14,634
At the end of next week,
you will compete in a 24-hour
tactical field exercise

1120
01:03:14,702 --> 01:03:18,355
that will employ everything
you've learned during Basic.

1121
01:03:18,255 --> 01:03:22,842
What you're about to see
is a video that highlights
what you've been taught.

1122
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:27,847
What you review here
is crucial to your
success. Good luck.

what is this?

1128
01:03:44,499 --> 01:03:46,265
Give me that remote.

1134

<i>That's all of me.</i>
<i>You're my woman now.</i>

1135
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,244
Give me that.

<i>Like a big man.</i>

1137

Did you know? Did you have
something to do with this?

1138
01:04:03,951 --> 01:04:05,352
I swear to God,
I had nothing
to do with this.

Wow.

1143
01:04:21,802 --> 01:04:22,985
How did you know about
Morley, Valentine?

1144
01:04:23,053 --> 01:04:24,888
Yeah.

1145
01:04:24,955 --> 01:04:28,758
I knew there was something
familiar about Morley from
the first time I saw her.

1146
01:04:28,826 --> 01:04:32,930
A little snooping
around from Delores,

Hey, Hamamori,

Is that what

Of course not.

Yes, but it's not
how it sounds.

Megan, I'm here

something of myself.

And you go off

Thanks a lot.

like Jeter, but at least
she is who she is.

1168
01:05:30,856 --> 01:05:31,989
She isn't a fake.

I changed my mind.

1170
01:05:33,825 --> 01:05:35,559
You are a good actress.

1171
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:37,044
You said we
were friends.

We are.

I really believed you.

1174
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:42,032
I really thought that
you got your heart broken,

01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,335
and your bank
account emptied.

were just here to prepare

01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:59,651
Well, you said it best right
here, Valentine. "I don't
belong with these people."

1181
01:06:01,337 --> 01:06:05,774
Private Valentine,
report to the
Captain's office.

On the double.

You're sprung, kid.
How's that for an agent?

What do you mean?

01:06:21,074 --> 01:06:23,141

in your contract.

You were supposed
to take a physical

You don't have either one.

Bottom line,
you're free to go.

1191

And get this. They caught
Barry in Amsterdam.

He's already given up
information on two
offshore accounts.

you are going to get
your money back.

You didn't hear?

1217
01:07:47,144 --> 01:07:50,279
Private Valentine took
a voluntary discharge.

I didn't think
she'd quit.

Peek-a-boo.
Peek-a-boo,
did you miss me?

1237
01:09:24,175 --> 01:09:25,508
(MOANS)

1238
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,648
Miss Valentine.

1239
01:09:32,484 --> 01:09:33,550
Oh!

1240
01:09:51,636 --> 01:09:53,720
SIDNEY: Well, why can't
I get a reservation then?

1241
01:09:53,787 --> 01:09:56,740
Lemon, cayenne pepper,
and maple syrup.

1242
01:09:56,808 --> 01:09:59,626
I tell you, it just
cleans you right out.

1243
01:09:59,693 --> 01:10:02,695
Well, if you want a real
workout, you've gotta
try Kundalini yoga.

1244
01:10:05,851 --> 01:10:07,518
First things first.

1245
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,087
Amber,

1246
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,558
you're fired.
- What?

1247
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:17,094
You can kiss
my ass goodbye.

1248
01:10:23,269 --> 01:10:24,902
I really didn't wanna
work for you anyway.

1249
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,571
Good for you.

1250
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,590
You should have done
that years ago. I'm almost
positive she's the one

1251
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,958
who put up those nipple
shots of you on YouTube.

1252
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:32,377
She is such
a little phony.

1253
01:10:32,444 --> 01:10:34,128
A phony?
- Mmm-hmm.

1254
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:36,764
I think I see
a phony sitting
right in front of me.

1255
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:39,250
You are so fired.

1256
01:10:39,317 --> 01:10:41,568
You've gotta be kidding
me. Megan, what would
you do without me?

1257
01:10:41,636 --> 01:10:44,305
I would wear what
I want and I would
date straight men.

1258
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:45,773
What I did I do?

1259
01:10:45,624 --> 01:10:47,808
You screwed my boyfriend.

1260
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,261
So? I didn't love him.

1261
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,346
Nigel, get out.

1262
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,899
Fine. You know, I was gonna
dump you this week anyway,

1263
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:56,033
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

1264
01:10:56,101 --> 01:10:57,485
so I guess it all
just worked out fine.

1265
01:10:57,553 --> 01:11:00,572
Hey, Britney,
how are you?
How are the kids?

1266
01:11:00,639 --> 01:11:03,157
I'm good. I was just
thinking about you.

1267
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:06,076
Morris.
- Yes.

1268
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:08,446
I want you to hire me
a new accountant,

1269
01:11:08,513 --> 01:11:10,565
and I wanna sign off
on every single check,

1270
01:11:10,632 --> 01:11:12,767
and I wanna know all
the money that goes out.

1271
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:14,385
Okay.

1272
01:11:15,787 --> 01:11:17,504
Sidney,

1273
01:11:17,572 --> 01:11:22,276
from this very moment,
I decide what film
role I take,

1274
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:24,078
I decide what
interview I do,

1275
01:11:24,145 --> 01:11:27,616
I decide who I want to be
and I decide who I date.

1276
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:31,053
Well, unless
he's really hot.

1277
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:35,123
I'm not crazy
or anything.

1278
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:37,693
Am I fired?

1279
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:39,161
No.

1280
01:11:39,229 --> 01:11:40,445
(EXHALES)

1281
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:44,984
Are we clear?

1282
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:47,703
I said, are we clear?

1283
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:49,154
ALL: Yes, absolutely.

1284
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,488
Of course.
Of course.
Of course.

1285
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,974
Good. As you were.

1286
01:11:55,078 --> 01:11:57,963
I'll see you guys
next week, okay?

1287
01:11:57,831 --> 01:11:59,715
Where are you going?

1288
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:02,317
To finish what I started.

1289
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:10,308
Your final field training
exercise is a test of all
the skills you have learned.

1290
01:12:10,376 --> 01:12:15,080
This will also be a timed
test of endurance and how
you work as a team.

1291
01:12:15,147 --> 01:12:16,248
Your squad...

1292
01:12:16,316 --> 01:12:18,066
(SCREAMS)

1293
01:12:18,134 --> 01:12:21,020
Well, if it isn't
Miss Grace.

1294
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:30,095
Welcome back, Hollywood.

1295
01:12:30,163 --> 01:12:35,016
As I was saying, your
platoon will be divided
into squads of five.

1296
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:37,919
I will appoint a leader
for each squad.

1297
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:41,390
You will be given a map,
coordinates, and a compass.

1298
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,342
You will not be
given any food.

1299
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:45,010
You will be given MREs.

1300
01:12:45,078 --> 01:12:48,214
That's Meals Ready-to-Eat
stashed along your route.

1301
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,631
Now, if you don't find them,

1302
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,602
or somebody steals them,
then you don't eat.

1303
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:58,958
Your squad's objective is
to locate a wounded soldier,
represented by a dummy.

1304
01:12:59,026 --> 01:13:00,760
You must then
transport him

1305
01:13:00,827 --> 01:13:04,981
to the Emergency Field
Hospital located in our
Urban Warfare Center.

1306
01:13:05,049 --> 01:13:08,585
You will be in
full combat mode
until you get there.

1307
01:13:08,653 --> 01:13:12,105
An aggressor team will
be trying to stop you.

1308
01:13:12,173 --> 01:13:16,993
They are some of the
meanest, toughest, baddest
graduates we have.

1309
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,893
(ALL EXCLAIM)

1311

They are all awaiting
Ranger training and can't
wait to capture you.

1312
01:13:24,869 --> 01:13:28,922
Now, if what can only
be called dumb luck,

1313
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:31,424
and you happen to
capture one of them,

1314
01:13:31,492 --> 01:13:34,294
your squad gets
one hour deducted
from your time.

1315
01:13:34,362 --> 01:13:35,929
Don't get happy.

1316
01:13:35,997 --> 01:13:39,682
This has never happened
before, platoon. So don't
count on it.

1317
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:44,137
Any team not crossing the
finish line within 24 hours,

1318
01:13:44,205 --> 01:13:47,089
must repeat the
full exercise.

Great. Guess who
our leader is?

You guys ready to save
some dummy's ass?

1326

We're not worried
about you, Valentine.

1327

Congratulations.

1328

For what?

1329
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:26,847
Coming back. Finish
what you started.

1330
01:14:26,915 --> 01:14:28,148
Thank you, Sergeant.

1331
01:14:28,216 --> 01:14:29,799
And you got me
as your land grader.

1332
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:32,870
Sweet. What does that mean?

1333
01:14:32,938 --> 01:14:34,721
It means I'll be coming
along with your team.

1334
01:14:34,789 --> 01:14:37,924
Strictly as an observer
and a safety net, every
step along the way.

1335
01:14:37,992 --> 01:14:39,943
And I can't help you.

1336

You already have,

you back, Valentine.

Good luck out there.

back, didn't I?

something to say.

but you have to
give me another chance.

Why? Because, Johnson,
you wanna go home and
see your little girl.

Are we gonna do this?

Is the speech over?

is broken.

he's not coming back.

When each of
you arrived here,

1551
01:27:59,435 --> 01:28:04,106
you were unshaped, unsure,
but full of potential.

1552
01:28:05,408 --> 01:28:07,677
You've been
through the fire.

1553

You've come out
stronger. Stronger
than you ever imagined.

1554
01:28:13,651 --> 01:28:16,719
You're now a soldier
in the United States Army.

1555

I knew you had it in you.

That's so sweet.
Thank you.

Good job.

I can't believe
you're leaving right
after graduation.

Me either.

1569
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:14,710
But that's the deal
I made with Captain Greer.

1570
01:29:14,778 --> 01:29:19,165
He'd let me finish Basic
Training, then I'd go be
with the USO for a year.

1571
01:29:19,233 --> 01:29:21,468

for inviting us.

1586

All those letters
that you wrote meant
so much to the kids.

01:31:19,055 --> 01:31:20,538
They meant a lot
to me, too.

Jinny, I know it's hard
being my sister sometimes.

And I have a lot
of making up to do.

1590
01:31:25,294 --> 01:31:28,946
But I want you to know
that my priorities
are different now.

1591
01:31:29,015 --> 01:31:31,083
I really miss you.

Hi.

I just wanted to say,
well done, Private.

Thank you, Private.

1598
01:31:49,151 --> 01:31:51,602
You deserve
those stripes back.

I know.

1600
01:31:53,373 --> 01:31:55,790
And that comment that
I made the other day?

1601
01:31:55,858 --> 01:31:59,077
About me needing
to get laid? I will.

Jeter, can I hug you?

No.

That personal space
is reserved.

1605

Get back on that
horse, girl.

Hey.

It was impressive
what you did out there.

1610

It was the whole platoon.
We did it together.

1611

No, I mean, coming
back and finishing.
That took guts, Private.

Thank you.
That means a lot
coming from you.

Wow.

So, does this mean
you're not my

No, I'm not.
