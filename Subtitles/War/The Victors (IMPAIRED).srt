- At first.

Would you cook it?

Thank you.
I should be most grateful.

- Could we do it now, do you think?
- Sure.

Hmm. I'm sure
you're dying to bathe,

494

but the water went off the first day.

Lady, it's been so long
since I had a bath,

496
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,231
I'd probably drown in a bathtub.

497
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:57,869
I've got plenty of water out there
in the jeep to cook with, anyway.

And the big guns roared and roared.

506
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,351
And I was sure the house would
collapse around me and bury me,

507
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,317
and I would never be found,
except as a corpse.

508
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:50,879
And at first, I thought
I would lose my mind.

to think and remember

every line of poetry
I ever knew and loved.

512

I'm sure it saved my sanity.

I know now, the body is nothing
and the mind is everything.

I remember, just when it seemed
it would never end,

515

I kept thinking of that line,

"The universe is nothing
but a flaw in the purity of non-being."
