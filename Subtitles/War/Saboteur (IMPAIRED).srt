439
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:16,784
How do you do ?
-How do you do ?

440
00:33:16,851 --> 00:33:20,420
Uncle Philip, there was a car full
of detectives down the road.

441
00:33:20,488 --> 00:33:22,623
They wanted to know
the way to town.

442
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:27,495
They're searching for a man that
got away from them. It was on all the radios.
They said he was really dangerous criminal...

443
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:30,832
My dear, the police
are always on the alarmist side.

444
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,002
- But they said this man is really dangerous !
- I'm sure they did.

445
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,906
How could they be heroes
if he were harmless ?

446
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:40,976
Would you mind not having any
further quotations from the police ?

447
00:33:41,044 --> 00:33:45,380
Their remarks are always so expected.
They kill conversation.

448
00:33:45,448 --> 00:33:49,350
You've probably seen the face
of my niece before, Mr. Mason.

449
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:52,421
Why, yes.  I was wondering
where I'd seen...

450
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:56,192
As a matter of fact, you've seen her
practically everywhere.

451
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:59,762
I'm told that billboards she adorns
would reach across the continent...

452
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,964
if placed end to end.

453
00:34:02,032 --> 00:34:04,433
I can't imagine who's going to
place them end to end,

454
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,637
nor why they should consider
it the thing to do.

455
00:34:07,705 --> 00:34:12,075
Uncle Philip never has been enthusiastic
over my career as a model.

456
00:34:12,143 --> 00:34:14,377
Oh, well, relatives are like that.

457
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:17,614
My, aren't you two mean,
going ahead and eating without me !

458
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,684
I'm starving.  Would you pass
me one of those plates, please, Mr. Mason ?

459
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,539
- Oh !
- What's the matter, Pat ?
Have you just seen his handcuffs ?

460
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:46,677
I heard them as
soon as he came in.

461
00:34:46,745 --> 00:34:49,081
Uncle Philip, he must be the man
they're looking for.

462
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:52,751
Yes, very probably.  But you should
have given him to the police !

463
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:56,053
Are you frightened, Pat ?
Is that what makes you so cruel ?

464
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,523
But you've got to !
He's a dangerous man.

465
00:34:58,591 --> 00:35:02,295
Oh, Pat, come on,
Mr. Mason may be many things,

466
00:35:02,362 --> 00:35:04,730
but he's certainly
not dangerous.

467
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:07,065
In fact, I'm not at all
convinced that he's guilty.

468
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:09,835
Uncle Philip, it's your duty as
an American citizen !

469
00:35:09,903 --> 00:35:12,505
It is my duty
as an American Citizen...

470
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:16,141
to believe a man innocent
until he's been proved guilty.

471
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:20,413
Don't tell me about my duty.
It makes you sound so stuffy.

472
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,249
Besides, I have my own ideas
about my duties as a citizen.

473
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:27,219
They sometimes involve
disregarding the law.

474
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:29,455
But what are you
going to do with him ?

475
00:35:29,523 --> 00:35:31,958
I'm going to turn him over
to you, my dear.

476
00:35:32,026 --> 00:35:34,994
And you're going to drive him
down to Tim, the blacksmith,

477
00:35:35,062 --> 00:35:39,700
and have those preposterous contraptions
removed from his wrists.

478
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:41,935
Oh, how could I do
a thing like that ?

479
00:35:42,002 --> 00:35:45,373
'Cause you know I can see
a great deal farther than you can.

480
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:50,345
I can see intangible things.
For example, innocence.

481
00:35:50,412 --> 00:35:53,247
Will you go with my niece, Mr. Mason ?
-Oh, yes, sir.

482
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:55,782
Uh, if you don't mind ?

483
00:35:55,851 --> 00:36:00,155
What'll I tell the blacksmith ?
Tell him Mr. Mason
is my friend...and my guest.

484
00:36:00,223 --> 00:36:02,657
He won't ask
any other questions.

485
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:08,596
Go ahead, Pat.

486
00:36:08,664 --> 00:36:12,667
Go with her, Barry.
Barry, I know, is your name.

487
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:15,604
Your voice explained to me
that "Mason" isn't.

488
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:20,309
But as I told you before, names are
of such little importance.

489
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:22,444
I...I don't know how to
thank you, Mr. Martin.

490
00:36:22,512 --> 00:36:24,913
Go ahead, Barry.
Go ahead.

491
00:36:24,981 --> 00:36:28,284
And do the things...
I wish I could do.

492
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,125
Good luck, Barry,
and for heaven's sake...

493
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:39,028
get back in practice
on that triangle !

494
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:48,272
Is the blacksmith's shop very far ?
-Not very...right along here.

495
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:53,142
And, uh, is he...
is he really all right ?

496
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,179
He and my uncle
are great friends.
-Oh.

497
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,049
I guess he's all right, then.

498
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,786
You needn't worry.
He's all right.

499
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:06,857
He's a darling blacksmith, only
I'm not sure how much experience
he's had with handcuffs.

500
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:09,460
Do you mind if I see them ?

501
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:12,230
What do they do to get them off ? I...
I can't quite see.

502
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:14,198
Could you hold them nearer ?

503
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:19,571
Now I feel better.
-I'll bet you do.

504
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,572
I'll bet this makes you feel great,
doesn't it ?

505
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,110
The blacksmith shop is two miles back.
We're on our way to the police.

506
00:37:25,178 --> 00:37:27,146
Your uncle's certainly
gonna be proud of you !

507
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:30,682
The world isn't full of kind old gentlemen
like my uncle; you're gonna find that out !

508
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,419
Even my uncle wouldn't have
been so kind if he'd known more.

509
00:37:33,486 --> 00:37:37,156
All right, go ahead. What'd I do ?
I'd be kinda happy to know.

510
00:37:37,223 --> 00:37:40,560
If it had been any other crime...
if a man had stolen because he was starving,

511
00:37:40,627 --> 00:37:44,197
even committed murder to defend himself,
maybe I wouldn't tell the police.

512
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:46,732
But there's only one reason
why a man commits sabotage.

513
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,004
That's worse than murder.
-Surprise !  I agree with every word.

514
00:37:51,072 --> 00:37:53,740
Please don't talk to me.
-That'll be my pleasure.

Ah ! stowaways !

586
00:44:01,124 --> 00:44:04,562
In the middle of this desert sea,
we acquired two more vagabonds.

587

Bedouins like ourselves, eh, Esmeralda ?
-Why, they're just a couple of kids !

00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:11,869
Uh, our car broke down, a way back,
and we've walked for miles.

589
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:14,071
So we just sort of hopped on.
We didn't want to wake you at this hour.

590

Broke down, eh ?
We didn't pass no wrecks
on the highway.

591

and a parked car.  That's nice.

- Oh, no, really...
- Esmeralda !  Everywhere
you search for sex.

Get your eyes out of the mud
and look up at the stars.

- And this is Esmeralda,
our bearded lady.

Naturally, we're very proud to have
her as a member of our group.

a couple hundred miles north, I think.

Well, then, you won't get there 'til morning,
so make yourselves comfortable.

You must meet
our other co-worker:

Titania,
our little human mountain.

603

her silly old face.

Are you girls not speaking
to each-other again ?  Dear, dear!

609
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,509
Marigold's mad because I got
her beau away from her back
in the last town we played.

610
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:25,011

I heard that last remark.

611

in question as a gift.  Nothing

In this situation I find
a parallel for the present

it's the good people that stick
when anybody's in trouble,

00:54:15,834 --> 00:54:18,936
Look at this.
It's been in use.

727
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:23,975
Let's go around
to the window.

Don't cut yourself.

Hello ?  Hello ?

732
00:54:54,607 --> 00:54:57,143
Hung up.
-What sort of phone is that ?

733
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,279
It's a field telephone.

734
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,261
Well, a room with a view.

735
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:18,465
What do you suppose
they cut that for ?
-I don't know.

736
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:21,034
Say, look.

737
00:55:21,102 --> 00:55:23,002
Tripod.

738
00:55:25,207 --> 00:55:27,408
Looks like it's
the right height.

739
00:55:27,476 --> 00:55:29,710
Yeah.

740
00:55:29,778 --> 00:55:32,113
Something else
goes with this.

741
00:55:34,015 --> 00:55:35,916
There !

742
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,722
That's it.

743
00:55:53,303 --> 00:55:55,204
[ Pat ] See anything ?
-Not yet.

744

[ Barry ]
Uh-oh.

745
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:00,009
Let me see !

746
00:56:04,681 --> 00:56:08,551
Why, that's a...  Why, Barry !
-Yeah.

747
00:56:09,854 --> 00:56:12,522
Better put this away.  Take that.

748
00:56:17,995 --> 00:56:21,131
- Say !  The wood.
- What about it ?

749
00:56:21,198 --> 00:56:23,234
You wouldn't burn that in the stove.
-Why not ?

750
00:56:23,301 --> 00:56:25,202
The smoke would show.

751
00:56:34,546 --> 00:56:37,282
[ Door Shuts ]
That's a car.

752
00:56:38,851 --> 00:56:41,719
You better hide.
No, not here.

753
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:04,611
Hey...What do you think you're
doin' around here?

754
00:57:05,712 --> 00:57:09,549
I, uh...I was wonderin' when you'd get here.
-Where you from ?

755
00:57:09,616 --> 00:57:12,385
What are you stickin'
around here for ?

756
00:57:12,452 --> 00:57:15,087
Excuse me.

757
00:57:32,273 --> 00:57:36,411
Funny, you knowin' about
this place.  I don't quite get it.

758
00:57:36,478 --> 00:57:38,779
You might have thought it over
more carefully.

759
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:41,082
Your coming here
doesn't help us a bit.

760
00:57:41,149 --> 00:57:43,983
[ Old Man ] The heat's on this guy
and he shows up here!

761
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:47,755
Tobin sent me !
-The old man must be off his nut
sending him up here.

762
00:57:47,823 --> 00:57:52,327
Be a little more careful, Neilson.
Your criticisms in front of other people.

763
00:57:52,394 --> 00:57:57,098
- Yeah.  Don't talk that way about the old guy.
- I'll watch out for myself.

764
00:57:57,165 --> 00:57:59,800
Me too.  Don't forget about me.
That's why Tobin sent me here.

765
00:57:59,868 --> 00:58:03,672
He said you'd know
how to take care of me.

766
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,807
I guess that makes it
pretty clear, Neilson.

767
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:09,311
I don't know.  A guy walks in, out of the
desert, and right away I get orders.

768
00:58:09,379 --> 00:58:11,347
It ain't so clear to me.

769
00:58:11,414 --> 00:58:14,049
I'm a little better than a stranger,
if you'll remember my press clippings !

770
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:18,755
Yes.  Mister, uh...Kane has done
pretty well down south.

771
00:58:18,822 --> 00:58:22,524
His accomplishments can't be disregarded.
At least I hope not.

772
00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:25,694
A man that has served as well as he has
is entitled, at least, to recognition.

773
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:29,431
I'm entitled to more than that,
to protection too !  You guys have
got to take care of me.

774
00:58:29,499 --> 00:58:33,270
I'm sure the firm will do its best.
They're quite loyal to their employees.

775
00:58:33,337 --> 00:58:35,906
Neilson will see to it that the firm's
record is maintained.

776
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:39,442
You've  got it easy,
you guys from back East.

777
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:42,612
You give orders.
You do that, all right.

778
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,250
The big boys
with the desk jobs.

779
00:58:46,317 --> 00:58:49,186
All you gotta do is reach for a telephone,
sit back in a big leather chair,

780
00:58:49,254 --> 00:58:52,022
and us guys out here
have gotta take the rap.

781
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,591
You know, I think I'll go back East
and work for a while.

782
00:58:54,659 --> 00:58:57,294
You're not a very good
example of loyalty to the firm.

783
00:58:57,361 --> 00:59:00,731
[ Neilson ] Yeah ?  Well, I'm gettin'
just a little bit tired.  See ?

784
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,334
So am I !  I'm getting a little bit
tired of all this talk, let's get goin' !

785
00:59:03,402 --> 00:59:06,404
The trip up here was no pushover.
I had to hoof it most of the way.

786
00:59:06,471 --> 00:59:09,073
I got no place to hide you out.
That ain't in my line.

787
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,278
That ain't your line, huh ?

788
00:59:12,345 --> 00:59:14,613
What about you ?  You don't
seem so interested either !

789
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:18,082
I suppose you're just the big brains !
Or maybe you take a chance just for laughs !

790
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:21,352
Maybe it doesn't work that way.
Maybe I'm the only guy that
sticks his neck out !

791
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,988
Well, get this !
I pulled a big job,
and they're after me !

792
00:59:24,056 --> 00:59:27,359
And you guys have gotta take care of me,
or you're gonna have some trouble
on your hands !

793
00:59:27,427 --> 00:59:30,729
I've gotta get out of this part of the country !
The ground's burning up under my feet !

794
00:59:30,797 --> 00:59:34,766
I've gotta get back East !
It's more crowded and a guy
doesn't stand out, like here !

795
00:59:34,835 --> 00:59:37,536
Take it easy.
Hang onto your nerve.

796
00:59:37,603 --> 00:59:40,673
I've been hanging on to my nerve !
I've been hanging on long enough !

797
00:59:40,741 --> 00:59:44,110
I understand your difficulties,
I'm sorry about all the talk,
but in this business...

798
00:59:44,178 --> 00:59:46,411
we always have to make sure.

799
00:59:46,479 --> 00:59:49,148
I think I know him now.

800
00:59:49,216 --> 00:59:52,952
I'm driving back East, you know,
you'd better come with me.
-All right.

801
00:59:53,019 --> 00:59:55,621
Let's get goin'.
Get all the things together.

802
00:59:55,689 --> 00:59:58,725
After we leave,
I want this place cleaned up.
You won't be coming back here.

803
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:00,861
Why not ?
You think they got
the place spotted ?

804
01:00:00,928 --> 01:00:04,731
I'm making sure.
You'll have to find another
place and store all this stuff.

805
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:09,103
It's not gonna be easy.
-It's your job.  If you can't handle it,
I'll have to get someone else.

806
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:11,105
All right.
I'll handle it.

807
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:13,941
You'll need
some clothes.
Size 42?

808
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:16,309
What'll we do about these ?

809
01:00:16,377 --> 01:00:19,579
How did you manage
to break them ?
On an automobile fan.

810
01:00:19,646 --> 01:00:23,216
I think that's very bright of you.
I think we can even take care of that.

811
01:00:23,284 --> 01:00:26,420
But let's get started
now.
[ Thud ]

812
01:00:26,488 --> 01:00:28,722
Did you hear
something ?

813
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:31,058
Where does that lead to ?
-Just another room.

814
01:00:31,126 --> 01:00:33,427
The way out.

815
01:00:56,185 --> 01:01:01,156
You see, we figure that Kane and the other 
fellows are probably headin' for New York.

816
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:05,327
If there's anything I can do.
-We sure appreciate that.

817
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:08,031
Why, anyone would have done the same thing.
-That's right.

818
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:11,735
This war sure makes a difference.
Everybody wants to get in and pitch.

819
01:01:11,803 --> 01:01:13,970
Now, if you'll give me your address
in New York, Miss Martin,

820
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:16,239
we can contact you
back there.

821
01:01:16,307 --> 01:01:18,841
Or maybe you could wire me
about which plane you're taking...

822
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:20,911
We may want
to get a hold of you fast.

823
01:01:20,979 --> 01:01:25,182
I can do that when I
get back to my uncle.
-Okay, Miss Martin, just keep in touch.

824
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:31,188
I'm glad we came this way.
It adds a few miles, to our trip...

825
01:01:31,256 --> 01:01:34,058
but somehow, I've become
a little sentimental.

826
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:36,494
I want to take
a last look at it.

827
01:01:36,562 --> 01:01:40,298
Beautiful, isn't it ?
A great monument to man's unceasing industry...

828
01:01:40,366 --> 01:01:44,135
and to his stubborn
faith in the future.

829
01:01:44,203 --> 01:01:48,138
You'll be moving along soon.
Are you carrying any cameras
or firearms at all ?

830
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:50,475
Nothing at all, officer.
-You, sir ?

831
01:01:50,542 --> 01:01:52,477
No, sir.

832
01:01:52,544 --> 01:01:55,013
They must get a lot of power
from this dam.

833
01:01:55,081 --> 01:01:59,217
I think it supplies about 75%
for the Los Angeles district,

834
01:01:59,285 --> 01:02:03,022
naturally, including most of the power
for the defense plants there.

835
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:06,192
-Do you think there's a...
-Do you know Tobin very well ?

836
01:02:06,259 --> 01:02:09,695
No.  I met him just that once at his ranch.
-Did he have the child with him ?

837
01:02:09,762 --> 01:02:13,132
His grandchild ?  Yes.  He seemed to be
very fond of her.

838
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,068
Yes.  That's one of the things
I like about old Tobin:

839
01:02:16,136 --> 01:02:18,305
his love for that little girl.

840
01:02:18,373 --> 01:02:21,440
Evidence of a good heart.

841
01:02:21,509 --> 01:02:23,610
I have children too, you know ?
-Oh ?

842
01:02:23,677 --> 01:02:27,947
Two boys.  Nice little fellows.
Aged two and four.

843
01:02:28,015 --> 01:02:30,216
The four-year-old
is naughty at times.

844
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:32,219
He's quite a problem.

845
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:37,758
We get him a new toy and within
half-an-hour it's smashed to bits.

846
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:41,762
And then, sometimes,
after it's all over,

847
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:45,365
he seems almost sorry.

848
01:02:45,433 --> 01:02:48,503
Sometimes I wish my younger child
had been a girl.

849
01:02:48,571 --> 01:02:53,074
In fact, my wife and I often argue
over a little idiosyncrasy I have.

850
01:02:53,142 --> 01:02:55,643
I don't want his hair cut short
until he's much older.

851
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,612
Do you think it'd be bad for him ?
-Well, I don't know, it might be.

852
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,217
When I was a child,
I had long golden curls.

853
01:03:02,285 --> 01:03:04,719
People used to stop
on the street to admire me.

854
01:03:04,787 --> 01:03:08,457
Things are different nowadays.
If you gave the kid a haircut,
it might save him a lot of grief.

855
01:03:10,193 --> 01:03:12,027
Ah, we're on our way.

Same old phone company...
Should've paid the bill !
-This is no time for jokes !

871
01:04:22,002 --> 01:04:25,972
The police.  They're watching the office.
The disconnected phone, that's our signal.

872
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:28,374
Think they're watching for me ?
-I don't know.

873
01:04:28,442 --> 01:04:30,944
Who'd know you
were in New York ?

874
01:04:31,012 --> 01:04:33,212
Well, yeah,
I guess you're right.

875
01:04:39,621 --> 01:04:42,456
How about Brooklyn tomorrow ?
Do you want me on the job ?

876
01:04:42,524 --> 01:04:44,792
When are you gonna learn
to keep your mouth shut ?

877
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:47,828
Sorry.  I...I thought
he was in on it.
Shut up.

878
01:04:47,896 --> 01:04:49,930
It's all right.  I'm good at keeping secrets.

879
01:04:49,998 --> 01:04:51,831
Let's go.

880

[ Clerk ]  Mr. Freeman....

881
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:29,739
Hi, Mr. Freeman.
-Hello.

882
01:05:29,807 --> 01:05:33,109
#  [ Dance Band Nearby ]
Ah, pleased to see you !  Have a good trip ?

883
01:05:33,177 --> 01:05:37,081
Yes.  Thank you, Robert.
-Madam is upstairs, she's waiting anxiously.

884
01:05:37,148 --> 01:05:39,316
Oh, thank you, Robert.
We'll go right up.

885
01:05:39,383 --> 01:05:41,284
This way.

886
01:05:42,553 --> 01:05:44,487
Who was that ?

887

# [ Band Continues ] #

888
01:05:49,194 --> 01:05:51,329
Hey, is this a hotel ?
What's the festivity ?

889
01:05:51,396 --> 01:05:56,367
It's for a very worthy cause.  Mrs. Sutton
often gives her house over to charity affairs.

890
01:05:56,435 --> 01:06:01,171
She's a very generous woman, but she
isn't going to be pleased to see us
on a night like this.

[ Knocking on Door ]

892
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:10,081
[ Woman ]  Idiots, all of you.
Stupid, inefficient idiots.

893
01:06:10,149 --> 01:06:13,885
Everything is left to me.  I have to
hover over all you like an old hen.

894
01:06:13,953 --> 01:06:17,021
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sutton.
-The guests expect me to put in an appearance.

895
01:06:17,089 --> 01:06:20,793
After all, as you say, they want
something for their $25 !

896
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:23,763
I will not have
my benevolence abused.

897
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,666
My life, my position,
they're...important to me.

898
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:32,037
I'll do my best, Mrs. Sutton.
-I just wish your best were a little better.

899
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:35,175
Oh.  Mr. Freeman,
I'm glad you've come at this time.

900
01:06:35,243 --> 01:06:38,945
I was just telling Edward...
Is this the young man ?

901
01:06:39,013 --> 01:06:42,348
Must you bring him here  as well?
I certainly can't furnish him with sanctuary.

902
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:45,685
This house is full of guests,
important people !

903
01:06:45,753 --> 01:06:51,091
Don't you understand my position ?
The police are already watching your office.

904
01:06:51,159 --> 01:06:55,461
Thank goodness they'll never come here.
But a little more of your stupid behavior,

905
01:06:55,529 --> 01:06:58,598
and even the respectability
of my house won't shield you.

906
01:06:58,666 --> 01:07:00,500
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sutton,  we can't
leave any loose ends.

907
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:04,738
All right, all right !  But for heaven's sake,
stop playing the conspirator !

908
01:07:04,807 --> 01:07:08,609
Now tell me all you know
about the girl, or ask him.

909
01:07:08,677 --> 01:07:12,613
Why didn't you tell me
about the young lady
back in Soda City ?

910
01:07:12,681 --> 01:07:15,316
Well, I...I didn't think
it was important.

911
01:07:15,383 --> 01:07:20,022
She was just a girl, like anybody else.
She picked me up.  She was pretty.

912
01:07:20,089 --> 01:07:22,090
I guess it was kind of risky.

913
01:07:22,158 --> 01:07:24,492
Well, there you are.

914
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,895
I'm so sorry to have exposed
you to any risk.

915
01:07:27,963 --> 01:07:30,599
What's she doing here ?

916
01:07:30,667 --> 01:07:34,470
You're surprised to see me again.
-How did you get here ?

917
01:07:34,538 --> 01:07:38,407
It doesn't matter.  There was
no reason to bring her at all !

918
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:40,876
You see, I just learned on the
telephone at the gas station...

919
01:07:40,944 --> 01:07:44,046
that she was most indiscreet
after she left you at Soda City.

920
01:07:44,114 --> 01:07:48,184
She went to the local sheriff; who,
fortunately, happened to be a 
particularly good friend of ours.

921
01:07:48,252 --> 01:07:50,754
Don't waste time in explanations.

922
01:07:50,822 --> 01:07:53,756
You've got to get the girl
out of this house.

923
01:07:53,824 --> 01:07:56,259
I will not have my benevolence abused !

924
01:07:56,327 --> 01:08:00,231
So you played smart. That's great.
That's a big help to all of us.

925
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:03,433
No, I wasn't smart at all.

926
01:08:03,501 --> 01:08:08,172
I haven't been smart for four days.
Even when I went to the sheriff, I hesitated.

927
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,507
I hated to do anything that
might get you into trouble.

928
01:08:10,575 --> 01:08:14,045
Yeah, I sympathize.  The mistake
I made was not leaving you with the snakes !

929
01:08:14,113 --> 01:08:16,547
You might have learned to rattle.
I was right about you.

930
01:08:16,615 --> 01:08:19,885
Good evening, Mr. Kane.

931
01:08:21,153 --> 01:08:23,821
I didn't know you were a bookworm.

932
01:08:23,889 --> 01:08:28,726
You must let me choose something
appropriate for you. Something not
too difficult for you to understand.

933
01:08:28,794 --> 01:08:30,695
Let me see.

934
01:08:35,101 --> 01:08:37,468
Here we are.
This'll do admirably.

935
01:08:37,536 --> 01:08:41,207
Remarkable work.
Somehow prophetic.

936
01:08:41,275 --> 01:08:45,511
Why are you here, Charles ?
And, what's all this nonsense about books ?

937
01:08:45,578 --> 01:08:47,646
I am a refugee.

938
01:08:47,714 --> 01:08:51,750
I have at last joined that
revolting group of world travelers.

939
01:08:51,818 --> 01:08:56,022
One ultimately turns into the thing
one despises most.

940
01:08:56,089 --> 01:08:59,426
And whom have I to thank for it ?
You, Mr. Freeman.

941
01:08:59,493 --> 01:09:04,163
The girl was allowed to escape
unobserved.  She left Mr. Kane and
went straight to her uncle.

942
01:09:04,231 --> 01:09:07,199
That charming old man
went to the police.

943
01:09:07,267 --> 01:09:10,638
As a result, a whole hoard
of officers came to my house.

944
01:09:10,705 --> 01:09:13,307
Luckily, I was leaving
when they arrived.

945
01:09:13,374 --> 01:09:16,544
And the others...
the very loyal ones...

946
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:19,980
Well, they're paying for their loyalty.
How appalling !

947
01:09:20,048 --> 01:09:22,850
Your charming house.
I'm so sorry, Charles.

948
01:09:22,918 --> 01:09:25,954
Rather lucky.  You might have
been sorrier.

949
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:29,324
And you might have been a little more
efficient in this matter,  Mr. Freeman.

950
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:32,626
What good is it to insult me ?
We're in trouble now.

951
01:09:32,694 --> 01:09:36,897
So the most important thing is to
make sure of everyone around us.

952
01:09:36,966 --> 01:09:40,235
Mr. Kane.  I'm just not sure.
I want to know that he's all right.

953
01:09:40,303 --> 01:09:43,472
[ Tobin ]  All right ?
What an understatement!

954
01:09:43,539 --> 01:09:45,540
He's much more than that !

955
01:09:45,608 --> 01:09:48,777
He's noble and fine and pure.

956
01:09:48,845 --> 01:09:53,149
And so, he pays the penalty that the noble
and the fine and the pure must pay
in this world:

957
01:09:53,217 --> 01:09:55,318
he's misjudged by everyone.

958
01:09:55,386 --> 01:09:59,321
Why, even the police have a
completely erroneous impression of him.

959
01:09:59,389 --> 01:10:02,959
I can assure you that,
contrary to what is supposed,

960
01:10:03,026 --> 01:10:05,761
and to what he may have told you,

961
01:10:05,829 --> 01:10:08,665
that young man is certainly not one
of his country's enemies.

962
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:12,736
[ Mrs. Sutton ]  Charles, you're joking !
-I mean exactly what I say.

963
01:10:12,804 --> 01:10:16,139
Mr. Kane is definitely no part
of our little organization.

964
01:10:16,207 --> 01:10:20,310
Your protege.  Well, you've done splendidly.
You bring him here, you idiot !

965
01:10:20,378 --> 01:10:23,014
What in heaven's name
are we going to do with him ?

966
01:10:23,081 --> 01:10:25,517
That's a very appropriate question.

967
01:10:25,584 --> 01:10:30,087
Not much we can do with him.
I made the mistake once of
turning him over to the police.

968
01:10:30,155 --> 01:10:34,591
That's even more impossible at the moment.

969
01:10:34,659 --> 01:10:39,164
I'm afraid there's only
one thing we can do.

970
01:10:39,232 --> 01:10:43,701
You see, the new law threatens all of...

971
01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:46,271
us...with the death penalty.

972
01:10:46,339 --> 01:10:50,643
So I'm afraid we'll have to apply
the ancient axiom:  a tooth for a tooth.

973
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:52,711
A Kane for a Tobin.

974
01:10:52,779 --> 01:10:55,048
Please don't discuss things
of that sort here.

975
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:58,417
It's rather nauseating and quite out of place.

976
01:10:58,484 --> 01:11:01,954
Oh, Charles, I'm frightened.

977
01:11:02,022 --> 01:11:05,491
We must take all precaution.
-Of course, we must also continue
with our work.

978
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,596
It's too risky now.  We're abandoning
the dam.  We must remain inactive for a while.

979
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:13,499
Inactive ?  You are utterly mistaken.
Once we do that, our organization is finished.

980
01:11:13,568 --> 01:11:16,502
We must carry on at all cost.
- What about tomorrow's work ?

981
01:11:16,571 --> 01:11:19,974
Tomorrow's work ?  You can't
abandon that after all your preparations.
-But Charles,  the risk !

982
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,509
Is great !  I know that.

983
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:26,881
Unfortunately, we will have
to carry out our orders.

984
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:30,050
I'm leaving for the Caribbean now.

985
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:33,521
My position here is more impossible
than all of yours.

986
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:37,092
I'm rather looking forward
to Central America.

987
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:39,994
Havana will be very gay this season.

988
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:43,398
You know, somehow I've suddenly
had enough of this country.

989
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,934
The war has made it grim.

990
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:49,505
You're leaving us here to face
everything, and you'll be on a boat...

991
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:51,673
sailing along...it all sounds idyllic.

992
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:56,245
Oh, Charles, Charles,
It's...This whole thing...It's impossible !

993
01:11:56,313 --> 01:12:00,382
It's...panicky.
-I'm deeply sorry.

994
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:05,054
Ah, there you are, darling !
How unbecoming for a hostess
to hide herself away.

995
01:12:05,122 --> 01:12:09,291
Am I intruding ?  I'm so sorry, but I just
must kidnap Henrietta.  She'll be back.

996
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:12,862
I've had some trouble with these people.
They're doing the catering.  And making a
rather horrid mess of everything!

with the caviar !  I assure you !

Get to the house phone.

-They met me at the airport.
I thought they were the police.

1000
01:12:21,305 --> 01:12:25,342
Wait a minute.  No use
trying the way I came in.

1001

Let's walk right out through
the front door !  Might as well !

1002

Yes, sir !  We'll watch the back exit.
They won't get out.

No good.  See the one on the other side ?
He's one of them.  We'll never get out that way !

1005
01:12:46,232 --> 01:12:49,768
What can they do ?
Plenty.  They'd grab us.
We wouldn't have a chance.

1006
01:12:49,835 --> 01:12:53,705
These people would see them.
If anyone had a question,
we're gate crashers.

[ Exhales ]  Barry, this is awful !

Isn't there anyone we can trust ?

Sure.  All of them.
Only which one ?

sound sort of crazy.

I don't even know
how to start.

1012
01:13:15,763 --> 01:13:19,733
But this whole house is a hotbed
of spies and saboteurs.

1013
01:13:19,801 --> 01:13:22,435
I'm not being silly.  I assure you,
even our hostess, Mrs. Sutton...

1014
01:13:22,503 --> 01:13:25,873
What's the matter
with you, sir ?  You're drunk.

1015
01:13:25,941 --> 01:13:28,642
You're not even dressed.

1016
01:13:30,578 --> 01:13:33,980
What'd he say ?
He thinks I'm drunk.

1017
01:13:34,048 --> 01:13:37,517
[ Guest ] When I read in the papers
what those Japs are doing...

1018
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:41,122
[ Man Snapping Fingers ]  Beat it out !
Eight to the bar.

1019
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,791
Yeah, man.  Stay in there and pitch.
#  [ Swing ]

1020
01:13:43,859 --> 01:13:47,695
Pardon me.  Did you pay $25
to get in here tonight ?

1021
01:13:47,763 --> 01:13:49,897
No, not exactly. The boss gave
me a ticket.  Why ?

1022
01:13:49,965 --> 01:13:53,869
I need your help.  We're in the middle
of the biggest fifth columnists in this country.

1023
01:13:53,937 --> 01:13:56,671
Are you kiddin' ?  What's the gag ?
-No.  I'm on the level.

1024
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,741
Aw, you're kiddin' ?  We got a wagon to join,
The guy's tryin' to rib me.

1025
01:13:59,808 --> 01:14:04,279
Aw, sling him your curve.
Beat it out, son; beat it out!

1026
01:14:12,723 --> 01:14:16,392
Excuse me, sir.  I'd like to talk to you
about something very important.

1027
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:18,594
What is it, Mr. Kane ?

1028
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:21,464
You know it's hopeless.

1029
01:14:21,531 --> 01:14:25,469
Why don't you join Mr. Tobin
upstairs in a little supper ?

1030
01:14:25,536 --> 01:14:27,371
I'll show you the way.

1031
01:14:53,832 --> 01:14:58,135
Barry, before they get to us, stop
the music and tell them !
Tell them all !

1032
01:14:58,203 --> 01:15:01,971
This is the Sutton mansion.  I'm just
a guy from Glendale, California,
wanted by the police.

1033
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,073
They'll grab me as soon
as I open my mouth.

1034
01:15:04,141 --> 01:15:08,546
What are you gonna do ?  We can't
just stand here.  I know where we'll be safe.
 [ # ]

1035
01:15:12,451 --> 01:15:14,852
Barry, I'm scared.

1036
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:18,289
It's so unreal, all these people dancing
and having a good time.

1037
01:15:18,357 --> 01:15:20,592
And when you try to warn them,
they laugh at you.

1038
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:25,564
They think you're drunk. That grey-haired
man you spoke to seemed like such
an honest citizen.

1039
01:15:25,632 --> 01:15:30,401
Mmm, just a friend of the family.  I guess
the room's well sprinkled with them.

1040
01:15:30,469 --> 01:15:32,503
They're so smart.
That's what frightens me.

1041
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:34,707
Yeah, they're smart,
because they're ruthless.

1042
01:15:34,774 --> 01:15:37,643
It's easy to win when you
forget about the rules.

1043
01:15:37,711 --> 01:15:40,846
[ Sighs ] A man named Fry drops
a wallet in California,

1044
01:15:40,913 --> 01:15:43,181
and we wind up here,
you and me.

1045
01:15:43,249 --> 01:15:45,150
That's the only good part:
I'm with you.

1046
01:15:45,218 --> 01:15:48,788
I wish it were somewhere else...
the North Pole...I wouldn't care.

1047
01:15:48,856 --> 01:15:53,426
We might wind up there too, chasing
Fry over an old glacier !
[ Chuckles ]

1048
01:15:53,494 --> 01:15:57,764
Fry.  He seems so small now.
I'd forgotten about him.

1049
01:15:57,832 --> 01:16:00,166
So had I.

1050
01:16:00,234 --> 01:16:04,437
We can't just go on dancing
like it's Saturday night
at the Palladium.

1051
01:16:04,505 --> 01:16:06,406
We can't just wait
'til they get us.

1052
01:16:06,474 --> 01:16:08,608
What do you think
they'll really do ?

1053
01:16:08,676 --> 01:16:11,745
Well, right now, they're probably haggling
over the price with Murder, Incorporated.

1054
01:16:11,812 --> 01:16:16,851
Oh, Barry, please !
-Sorry, Pat,  I hate to be out of it now,
there's still so much to do.

1055
01:16:16,918 --> 01:16:20,053
If staying alive was ever important.
You heard what they said...

1056
01:16:20,121 --> 01:16:22,390
Something about a job they're going
to do tomorrow in Brooklyn.

1057
01:16:22,457 --> 01:16:25,559
The navy yard.
-One of us has got to get out of here.

1058
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:27,895
Maybe if I start something,
you can make a break for it.

1059
01:16:27,962 --> 01:16:31,266
What about you ?
-You can't worry about me, we've
gotta take a chance.

1060
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:34,769
[ Sighs ] Oh, Barry, why couldn't I have
met you a hundred years ago ?

1061
01:16:34,836 --> 01:16:37,205
On a beach somewhere.

1062
01:16:37,273 --> 01:16:41,376
Bathing suits looked awfully funny
a hundred years ago.

1063
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:44,713
I'll bet you'd look
beautiful though.

1064
01:16:52,255 --> 01:16:54,290
Afraid we're not behaving
very well.

1065
01:16:54,357 --> 01:16:57,092
What's the difference ?
We weren't invited anyway.

1066
01:17:04,134 --> 01:17:07,436
Pat, this moment
belongs to me.

1067
01:17:07,503 --> 01:17:10,839
No matter what happens,
they can never take it away
from me.

1068
01:17:10,907 --> 01:17:12,809
Oh, pardon me.
Do you mind ?

1069
01:17:23,254 --> 01:17:26,589
Oh, excuse me. Would you, uh...
Would you care to dance ?

1070
01:17:26,657 --> 01:17:29,493
Why, yes.  Certainly.

1071
01:17:30,895 --> 01:17:32,796
Oh, you're really
a much better dancer.

1072
01:17:32,864 --> 01:17:35,298
Thanks.  Who was the man
you were dancing with ?

1073
01:17:35,366 --> 01:17:37,667
I have no idea.
I never saw him before.

1074
01:17:37,734 --> 01:17:39,769
No, I mean the man
that just left you.

1075
01:17:39,837 --> 01:17:43,240
I know.  That's who I'm
talking about.  I never
saw him before in my life.

1076
01:17:51,816 --> 01:17:55,052
Oh, what a pity.
That was lovely.  I hope
you will ask me again.

1077
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,090
Oh, thanks.
Thanks a lot.

1078
01:18:01,927 --> 01:18:05,262
Well, young man, you seem to
be enjoying yourself.
Charming party, isn't it ?

1079
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:09,501
Where is she ?
-Your young lady ?  I thought
you were taking care of her.

1080
01:18:09,568 --> 01:18:12,938
Perhaps she has a headache
and is lying down somewhere.

1081
01:18:13,006 --> 01:18:16,408
Would you like to come with me
and look for her ?

1082
01:18:16,476 --> 01:18:18,377
Hold on.

1083
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:29,489
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Ladies and Gentlemen !

1084
01:18:29,557 --> 01:18:32,425
Your attention, please.

1085
01:18:32,493 --> 01:18:35,928
I...I have something
to tell you.

1086
01:18:35,996 --> 01:18:40,234
Something you ought to know about
this house and about your hostess.

1087
01:18:46,807 --> 01:18:51,045
Sir, before you go on, take a look
at the curtain on the balcony.

1088
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:11,299
I'm...uh, not much
of a...public speaker,

1089
01:19:11,367 --> 01:19:14,436
Ladies and Gentlemen,
and, uh...

1090
01:19:14,503 --> 01:19:17,838
some of you are probably wondering
how I can tell you anything
about your hostess...

1091
01:19:17,906 --> 01:19:21,343
that you, uh...
you don't already know...

1092
01:19:21,411 --> 01:19:25,214
her graciousness,

1093
01:19:25,282 --> 01:19:27,450
her kindness,
her many charities.

1094
01:19:27,517 --> 01:19:32,621
Well, I want to tell you that you
have a big surprise coming,
Ladies and Gentlemen.

1095
01:19:35,726 --> 01:19:38,694
Tonight, in this house, for the benefit
of this great cause...

1096
01:19:38,761 --> 01:19:40,629
for which she's already done so much,

1097
01:19:40,697 --> 01:19:44,333
our hostess, Mrs. Sutton, is
putting up for auction...

1098
01:19:44,401 --> 01:19:46,902
one of her most
treasured possessions,

1099
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,372
one of the famous Sutton jewels.

1100
01:20:02,886 --> 01:20:06,356
Mrs. Sutton, would you
kindly step forward ?

1101
01:20:14,833 --> 01:20:19,070
Thank you.
- Mr. Kane, the young lady
is asking to see you.

1102
01:20:19,138 --> 01:20:22,540
Are you sure ?
-I wouldn't keep her waiting
if I were you, sir.

1103
01:20:25,745 --> 01:20:27,846
Yes.  Uh...

1104
01:20:27,913 --> 01:20:32,118
Will someone please, uh,
uh...Admiral ?

1105
01:20:32,185 --> 01:20:37,388
Would you take over for me, please ?
I'm wanted on the phone.

1106
01:20:37,456 --> 01:20:40,324
Delighted, sir.
-Thank you.

1107
01:20:42,227 --> 01:20:46,598
Ladies and gentlemen, I will
entertain your bids for this
beautiful bracelet...

1108
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:49,735
which has been donated
by our hostess, Mrs. Sutton.

1109
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,904
What am I bid ?
-[ Man ] One thousand dollars.

1110
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,707
$1,000. has been bid.
Do I have any more ?

1111
01:20:54,775 --> 01:20:58,477
[ Guest ] Fifteen hundred.
-$1,500. has been bid.
Do I hear..?

1112
01:20:58,545 --> 01:21:01,414
[ Guest ] 1,750.
-$1,750. has been bid...

1113
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:04,950
[ Man ] Two thousand.
[ Admiral ]  $2,000. has been bid...

1114
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,924
Where is she ?

1115
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:15,528
You seem to have a soft spot
for that young lady.

1116
01:21:15,596 --> 01:21:17,831
You can't afford to make
yourself that vulnerable...

1117
01:21:17,899 --> 01:21:20,701
not when you're out trying
to...save your country.

1118
01:21:20,768 --> 01:21:25,839
Why is it you sneer every time
you refer to this country.  You've
done well here, I don't get it.

1119
01:21:25,907 --> 01:21:29,877
No, you wouldn't. You're one
of the ardent believers...
a good American...

1120
01:21:29,945 --> 01:21:33,748
all the millions like you, people
who plod along without
asking questions.

1121
01:21:33,816 --> 01:21:38,052
I hate to use the word stupid,
but it seems to be the only
one that applies...

1122
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:42,456
the great masses,
the moron millions.

1123
01:21:42,524 --> 01:21:46,060
Well, there are a few of us who are
unwilling to just troop along;

1124
01:21:46,128 --> 01:21:49,531
a few who are clever enough to see
that there's much more to be done...

1125
01:21:49,599 --> 01:21:53,000
than just live small,
complacent lives;

1126
01:21:53,068 --> 01:21:57,306
a few of us in America, who
desire a more...profitable
type of government.

1127
01:21:58,408 --> 01:22:01,210
When you think about it,
Mr. Kane,

1128
01:22:01,278 --> 01:22:05,281
the competence of totalitarian
nations is much higher than ours.

1129
01:22:05,349 --> 01:22:07,283
They get things done.

1130
01:22:07,351 --> 01:22:10,919
Yeah.  They get things done.

1131
01:22:10,987 --> 01:22:13,223
They bomb cities, sink ships,
torture and murder...

1132
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:16,592
so you and your friends can eat
off a gold plate.  It's
a great philosophy.

1133
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:20,529
I neither intend to be bombed
nor sunk, Mr. Kane.

1134
01:22:20,597 --> 01:22:22,698
That's why I'm leaving now.

1135
01:22:22,767 --> 01:22:27,872
And if things don't go right for you...
If, uh, WE should win...

1136
01:22:27,939 --> 01:22:29,774
then I'll come back.

1137
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:33,778
Perhaps I can get
what I want then: Power.

1138
01:22:33,845 --> 01:22:37,748
Yes.  I want that as much as you
want your comfort or your job...

1139
01:22:37,816 --> 01:22:40,118
or...that girl.

1140
01:22:40,186 --> 01:22:43,988
We all have different
tastes, as you can see.

1141
01:22:44,055 --> 01:22:48,660
Only I'm willing to back my tastes
...with the necessary force.

1142
01:22:48,727 --> 01:22:52,196
You certainly make it sound
smooth and easy.

1143
01:22:52,264 --> 01:22:54,733
Well, that's a trick.

1144
01:22:54,801 --> 01:22:57,169
I know the results of
that power you believe in.

1145
01:22:57,236 --> 01:23:00,272
It killed my friend, and it's
killing thousands like him.

1146
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:02,341
That's what
you're aiming at.

1147
01:23:02,409 --> 01:23:04,943
And it doesn't bother you,
I can see that.

1148
01:23:05,011 --> 01:23:07,012
Because you
really hate all people.

1149
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:09,148
Let me tell you something.

1150
01:23:09,216 --> 01:23:12,117
The last four or five days
