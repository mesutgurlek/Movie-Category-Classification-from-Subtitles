is completely classified.

621
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:40,435
So the Americans thought they were
following the Panamanian tanker.

622
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:43,856
- Yes.
- We've turned their own technology against them.

623
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:47,526
- Perfect countermeasure. - Any ship equipped
with the device becomes a phantom.

624
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:51,989
Soon, we'll have acoustic signatures
from ships all over the world.

625
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:53,615
The Americans
will run in circles.

626
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:58,203
Our engines were running.
We were making noise too.

627
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:02,624
Besides, the strength of a sonar echo is
directly proportional to the size of a ship.

628
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:05,836
And we're not exactly
a freighter.

629
00:43:05,836 --> 00:43:10,048
The Phantom magnifies the echo,
making us appear any size we want.

630
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:13,802
The genius of the algorithm is how
it makes us invisible to active sonar

631
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,722
and enables us to mask ourselves
as any ship we like.

632
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:20,767
We should all be very proud of what we've
accomplished here today, gentlemen.

633
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,478
To the Phantom.

634
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:32,779
I'm sure Squadron Command will be
pleased that the device is operational.

635
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:35,073
Of course.

636
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:37,117
As protocol dictates,
we'll send word to Fleet

637
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,369
as soon as we reach
our reporting point.

638
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:44,500
Protocol is the political officer's purview,
would you agree, Mr. Pavlov?

639
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,045
I agree that Fleet
will be pleased.

640
00:43:48,045 --> 00:43:51,882
Mr. Pavlov is one of the most
diplomatic political officers in the Navy.

641

- That's what I keep trying to tell him.

I assure you that my intentions are
purely that of the State and the party.

quite a bit of data to analyze.

Why did you feel
the need to say so?

661
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,590
You give me a direct answer and I
won't have to guess at what you mean.

662
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:16,341
What was the question?

663
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:19,136
If you agree we
should report to Fleet.

664

What are you worried about?
This is an historic moment.

Well, nonetheless, as officers of a ship
that could trigger the end of the world,

00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:32,774
I think we should
consider all scenarios.

What scenarios?

668
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:40,324
If the Americans can't track us with
all their money and technology...

...then our boats
can't track us either.

alter the purpose of this ship.

some rogue Spetsnaz force?

I was in a hunter-killer
exercise with Markov.

773
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:38,534
Command was sizing us up
for bigger things,

774
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:41,870
and I had so much to prove.

775
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:47,584
I knew Markov would never
expect me to fight in the blind,

776
00:52:47,584 --> 00:52:52,172
so I pulled into his wake.

777
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:55,717
But I never expected him
to reverse his engines, either.

778
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:01,223
During the collision,
I smashed my head into the gyro.

779
00:53:01,223 --> 00:53:05,394
When I came around, there was
a fire in the forward torpedo.

780
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:10,524
The men fighting it wouldn't...

781
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,905
...they wouldn't come out.

782
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:18,907
They refused.

783
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,369
So I was, um...

784
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:28,041
...I was forced
to seal them inside.

785
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:39,678
Eventually they just let the tubes
open and let the sea rush in.

786
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:43,432
Better to drown than burn,
I guess.

787
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:04,786
That should've been
the end of our careers, but...

788

my father to be shamed by me.

why a boat would go rogue.

One is to defect,
and the other it to start a war.

we should be able to create
a single-point detonation.
