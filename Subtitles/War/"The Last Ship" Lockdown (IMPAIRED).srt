00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:48,683
desperate to save my family from Ruskov.

164
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:52,687
Look, man, I can't help you.

165
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,256
And if I could, I wouldn't.

166
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:58,426
So let's just stick to chess, okay?

167
00:07:58,428 --> 00:07:59,894
Save your whining for someone else

168
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,328
or take it up with the captain.

169
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:05,934
Check.

170
00:08:18,345 --> 00:08:21,848
[Chittering and whimpering]

171
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,584
[Whispers] I'm sorry.

172
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:31,959
I increased the
concentration of her vaccine

173
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:34,061
and gave her some epinephrine,

174
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:37,230
though I can't say that
I am altogether hopeful.

175
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:39,632
But you expected this could happen.

176
00:08:39,634 --> 00:08:41,834
I expected that there
might be some setbacks.

177
00:08:41,836 --> 00:08:44,337
The virus seems to be a little
bit more complicated to target

178
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:46,038
than I anticipated.

179
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,608
And the added gene might not
be one that I've identified

180
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,110
as of yet.

181
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,711
So you don't really have an answer

182
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:53,679
for what's going wrong?

183
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:56,715
I'm still trying to figure out
what the right questions are.

184
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:58,650
You've gotta be kidding me.

185
00:08:58,652 --> 00:09:01,720
This is all part of the scientific process.

186
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,522
You heard what I told the crew earlier.

187
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:06,291
I did, and I kinda wish you
hadn't been so optimistic.

188
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:09,161
- Really?
- I said that I was ready to test.

189
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:11,396
I did not say that I had the vaccine.

190
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:14,199
You brought tea. You said you
would've brought champagne.

191
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:16,368
I am making progress.

192
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,902
It doesn't seem like it.

193
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:19,370
The biggest breakthroughs
almost always come

194
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:20,672
after the most enormous setbacks.

195
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,674
You just need to be patient.

196
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:25,409
[Sighs deeply] And how
you gonna dispose of them?

197
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:28,145
They're going to need
to be tossed overboard.

198
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:30,313
I can't leave them there rotting.

199
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:32,516
[Exhales deeply]

200
00:09:35,553 --> 00:09:37,755
Do it at night.

Flight deck.

202
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:42,092
If anyone asks,

203
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:45,663
just tell them that's hazardous waste...

204
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:48,032
Which is what it is.

205
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:53,997
Slattery: There's no way they all died.

206
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:55,698
Chandler: Six for six. [Sighs deeply]

207
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,568
- She has no idea why.
- Jesus.

208
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,570
I thought you said she had it.

209
00:10:00,572 --> 00:10:03,439
Apparently it's a little
more complicated than that.

210
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:05,373
She's got 28 more, right?

211
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,076
And if she keeps testing six at a time,

212
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:09,712
it might not leave her much wiggle room.

213
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:12,314
I don't wanna burn any more
fuel or time moving towards home

214
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:15,084
when we may be turning around
and heading back to Nicaragua.

215
00:10:15,086 --> 00:10:17,152
So we're stopping the ship.

216
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:18,887
Well, the closer we get to home,

217
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:21,090
the harder it's gonna be on
everyone if we reverse course.

218
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:22,691
We just told everyone

219
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:25,727
she's on the verge of having the vaccine.

220
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:27,229
Now what are we saying?

221
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,797
She's gonna be discreet

222
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,734
with how she disposes of the monkeys.

223
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,609
Well, I'm good with that.

224
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:43,278
If we go dead in the water without a plan,

225
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,746
people are gonna start
scratching their heads

226
00:10:44,748 --> 00:10:45,462
and chattering.

227
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:47,915
We just have to stall for a couple days,

228
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,851
just until we know what we're dealing with.

229
00:10:49,853 --> 00:10:51,685
Yes, sir.

230
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:54,421
Sir.

231
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:56,624
Quincy: Any idea why the
captain stopped the ship?

232
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,926
The officers are just trying
to figure out where to go

233
00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:00,261
to make the vaccine.

234
00:11:00,263 --> 00:11:02,196
Really?

235
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:03,597
Well, they don't wanna waste fuel

236
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:06,033
going in the wrong direction now.

237
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:08,569
That's odd,

238
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,905
because the only possible
places which could

239
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:13,775
accommodate the manufacturing
are in North America.

240
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:15,242
Well, maybe they're thinking about

241
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:18,011
going to Brazil or Venezuela.

242
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:19,980
I'm sure they got labs there.

243
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:21,447
Brazil and Venezuela were

244
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:23,483
the hottest zones in this hemisphere.

245
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:28,255
What does heat have to do with it?

246
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,090
Hot zones, <i>Bacon.</i>

00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,894
There is no way anchoring south of here

249
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:37,330
could even be contemplated,
and Dr. Scott knows it.

250
00:11:37,332 --> 00:11:40,667
I'm sure there's somewhere else.

251
00:11:40,669 --> 00:11:43,036
Puerto Rico has a lab.

252
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:44,771
But would the captain
wanna go anywhere near there

253
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:49,141
when Ruskov may still be
somewhere off the Cuban coast?

254
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,911
Something's wrong, Bacon.
Let me assure you.

255
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:53,445
Wrong how?

256
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:56,748
Dr. Scott's experiments must be failing.

257
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,751
Well, you said yourself that
they should be using you.

258
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,054
If they were really failing,
don't you think they would be?

259
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,323
Your captain's a stubborn man.

260
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,458
He hates to admit he's
wrong, and as a result,

261
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,393
the wrong people get punished.

262
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,964
He just about tore a hole in
the hull evading the Russians

263
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:15,166
because he didn't wanna share
the ingredients for the vaccine.

264
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,634
Then he almost got everyone killed

265
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,369
when the water filtration broke.

266
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,139
That crazy stunt with the parachutes...

267
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,709
Nobody's knows what's
happening until it's over.

268

I speak the truth, Bacon.

269
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,488
Whether or not you want to
hear it is another matter,

270
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,357
but your captain is
hiding something from you.

You have to understand, if
this is airborne or blood-borne,

we will all be infected.

The most likely scenario is
that he was bitten by an insect.

In which case, he will not be contagious.

What do you mean?

365
00:16:57,348 --> 00:16:59,482
Me and Cossetti saw her

off the flight deck.

367

And where the hell is she
heading with the captain

- in such a rush?
- I don't know.

369
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:07,356
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.
Nobody knows anything.

370
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:09,024
This will keep him sedated.

371
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:11,160
It'll lower his fever and rehydrate him.

372
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:13,962
I'll be back to replace the
bag in a couple of hours.

- [Door closes]
- Sir, you need to lockdown the ship.

376
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:31,080
No, he does not. I tested
everyone before we boarded.

377
00:17:31,082 --> 00:17:32,681
That was two days ago.

378
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,683
I mean, maybe the virus
hadn't taken hold yet.

379
00:17:34,685 --> 00:17:37,720
It doesn't work like that.
If he'd been exposed,

380
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,787
it would present itself in
his blood within a few hours,

381
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:41,288
if not a few minutes.

382
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,224
All right, everybody. Let's
put our panties back on

How do you know the strain in Nicaragua

386
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:55,536
isn't different from the
other ones you've seen?

387
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,040
Even if it was,

388
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:00,708
its essential core would be the same,

389
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,011
and that is what I test for.

390
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:05,812
But what if you're wrong?

391
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:08,181
The mistakes that I made with the vaccine

392
00:18:08,183 --> 00:18:11,218
are an entirely different matter.

393
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,486
That was an experiment.

394
00:18:12,488 --> 00:18:15,656
This test I am certain of 100%.

Captain.

490
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:01,521
I know that I kept things
from you in the Arctic,

491
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,323
but I thought that we understood

492

that we were in this together now.

493
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:08,561
And I will always be straight with you.

- absolutely 100% about something...
- I don't know you.

I just happen to be who you're stuck with.

505
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:40,326
You might wanna figure
out a way how to trust me,

506
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,794
or I have a pretty strong feeling

507
00:24:41,796 --> 00:24:43,496
that this whole thing is gonna fail.

508
00:24:57,486 --> 00:25:00,522
Cossetti saw Dr. Scott
dumping biohazard off the deck.

509
00:25:00,524 --> 00:25:02,324
No, I'm quite sure that was the monkeys.

510
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:04,158
Her vaccine is failing,

511
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,528
and the captain is covering it up.

512
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,164
So... those monkeys were infected?

513
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,666
Of course.

514
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:13,134
She's injecting them with the virus

515
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,102
to see if her vaccine is working.

516
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:16,670
And when it doesn't, they die.

517
00:25:18,006 --> 00:25:20,208
Do you think that's why
captain called for the lockdown?

518
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,044
It sounds to me the captain
feared an outbreak on the ship.

519
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:24,511
Because of the monkeys?

520
00:25:24,513 --> 00:25:26,147
Or because he doesn't trust her test.

521
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,515
Don't forget a bunch of
them were directly exposed

522
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:31,018
to the disease in Nicaragua.

523
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,854
But they wore the suits.

524

So did Frankie Benz, and
he didn't make it back.

I imagine you're not the only one

No. There's a lot of grumbling.

A lot of grumbling.

At the beginning of this epidemic,

531
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:51,438
your captain told you all

532
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,041
that this ship was the
safest place on earth.

533

be further from the truth.

powerful, most contagious virus

I'm your leader,

We've all seen Dr. Rachel Scott,

but most of you have no idea

She fought to be here,

without completely boring your socks off.

697

You see, the monkeys have been dying

because... right now,

I'm sure you've all heard
of the disease yellow fever.

It killed millions of
people all over the world.

701
00:34:58,249 --> 00:35:02,751
In 1937, there was a young
doctor named Max Theiler

702
00:35:02,753 --> 00:35:05,188
who was testing a vaccine on mice.

703
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,656

of the virus in their vaccine.

But each and every time, the mice died,

706

they found it.

I don't have the answers today,

But I can promise you this...

712
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:37,219
There's absolutely nothing
that will stop me until I do.

713
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:41,823
It's easy to believe in people

when they're succeeding.

But that's not what we're about.

716

We have to believe in
each other when we fail.

717
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,368
And if we have to go back to
Nicaragua for more monkeys,

00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,903
we will.

we will do together.

we know... good or bad.

that there's a group of you
