No.

4
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,471
Tallmadge. No.

Samuel.
Samuel Tallmadge.

6
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:46,512
Rebel officer,
captured at Valcour Island.

7
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:49,148
- No.
- Aye?

8
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,505
Ah, Tallmadge.
Here he is.

9
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:53,890
Or was.

10
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:57,192
Died just before Christmas.

11
00:00:58,306 --> 00:01:01,183
Dysentery, supposedly.

12
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,331
- ( Body splashes )
- Thank you for visiting the Jersey.

13
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,636
Who was his bunkmate?

14
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,373
Bunkmate?

15
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,844
You know what I mean. The
man he talked to the most.

16
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:22,681
- How should I bloody know...
- Go and find him now

17
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:25,584

over the side, eh?

18

( Chuckles )

19
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:30,456
Go on.

20
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,159
All right.

21
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:37,863
I spent three years
on a bucket like this.

<i>You make a friend fast
or you die.</i>

23
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,473
A ship like this
brought me over.

24
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,378
They pitched so many
bodies into the sea,

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,614
the sharks would
follow us like dogs

26
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,616
- waiting on table scraps.
- ( grunting )

27
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,321
We're the sharks now.

28
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:05,724
You remember that.

29

00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,240
You knew Samuel Tallmadge?

32
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,776
Huh?

33
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,846
Hey, what's your name?

34
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,383
Hmm?

35
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,685
Where are you from?

36
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,756

37
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,892

<i>Where the Tallmadge boys roam.</i>

41
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:50,836
So, you and Sam

42

<i>- What's his name?

<i>- Bastard!
- All right.</i>

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,514
What are you doing here?
This is my home!

62
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:13,719
Aye, and a fine little home
it is, albeit a bit lonely.

63
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,821
And you are aware
that the soldier

64
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,489
who is quartered here
will be back soon.

65
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,625
Well, we'd better
eat quick, then.

66
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,331
It's fine silver.

67
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,867
I'll get you a good price for it
across the Sound, if you like.

68
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,603
Give me that. We're supposed
to meet in the cove.

69
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,006
Yeah, and you're supposed
to hang a petticoat.

70
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,608
When I'm ready with the intelligence.
That was the plan.

71
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,543
When you're ready?
It's been two months

72
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:40,812
<i>since you passed on that little
morsel about sauerkraut.</i>

I've been having trouble
getting into the city

74
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,684
without raising
suspicions, all right?

75
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,886
It's not as easy
for me as you'd think.

76
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:50,389
<i>Caleb: No one thinks it is easy.</i>

<i>But this is about
more than just you.</i>

- That is your new Bible.

<i>It's a code dictionary.</i>

<i>Makes sure that anything

<i>can't be read by the enemy.
In case of intercept.</i>

82
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,980
Each word has its own number.

83
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,050
Ben chose the words
he thought we'd use most.

84
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:19,951
Now, look.

85
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:26,491
Here, 722.
That's you.

86
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,761

Yeah, but hang on a sec.

89
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:37,769
Look, 722 says here
Samuel Culper.

90
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,871
Culpepper. Yeah?

91
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,874
That's your alias, all right?

92
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,078
It's the only name we use for
you back at headquarters.

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,480
Woodhull does not exist.

94
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,882
Culpepper.
Culpeh-per.

95
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,017
Cul-pepper.

96
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,753
Peeper, Piper, Pepper.

97
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,421
I hate it.

98
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:59,358
Well, Washington
picked that one.

99
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,893
And Ben picked Samuel
on account of his brother.

100
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,896
Washing... Washington?
General Washington?

101
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,934
That's right.
Old 711 himself.

102
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,443
"Mercy, Moment,

Murder, Measure."

104
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,515
I'm not gonna
remember all this.

105
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,953
That's why you keep
the book hidden.

106
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,590
<i>Now, when can I tell them
you're heading back</i>

107

<i>to British headquarters?</i>

108
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,697
This draft note confirms
that I gave half my hay

109
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,532
to the King's Army
on October 12th.

110
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,434
But Colonel Beecham
will not accept it

111
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,902
in exchange for new seed.

112
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,470
<i>Hewlett:
Nor should he.</i>

113

<i>Colonel Beecham
is the land commissary.</i>

114
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,541
That certificate
is meant for Captain Dodd.

115
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,476
<i>Richard: Dodd will
convert that note,</i>

116
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,612
but you need to get Faro and
Harborough to sign off.

117
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,615
- Yes, but...
- Next in line, please.

118
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,654
State your name and your case.

119
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,756
Anna Strong to seek parole
for my husband, Selah Strong.

120
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,758
<i>Richard: On what grounds
do you seek parole?</i>

121
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,428
It has been four months since he
has been remanded to the Jersey

122
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,830
and still no evidence has been
brought forward against him.

123
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,699
We have several witness
accounts of a petition

124
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,103
naming your husband as
delegate to an illegal body

125
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,106
known as the New York
Provincial Congress.

126
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,575
Counsel recommends
no parole at this time.

127
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,043
Next in line!

128
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,712
Major, please. You are a man of honor.
I beg you, listen.

129
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,181
Madam, you will address
the magistrate.

130
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:32,217
Unless this so-called
petition is produced,

131
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,119
the charge against
my husband is hearsay.

132
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,855
<i>Richard: Selah Strong
confessed to insurrection.</i>

133
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,557
You forced him to confess

134
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,025
so you could
lay claim to our land

135

piece to your friends.

<i>Rogers:
So, Selah Strong.</i>

143

You knew Samuel Tallmadge

All my life.

145

And his brother Benjamin?

146
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,032
Well, I have to tell you,

147
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,501
I've been to your little town

148
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:25,904
and I've met
your lovely wife, Anna.

149
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:29,708
Poor woman has been pining after
ya, ain't that right, Jordan?

150
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,712
Yes, every week she asks the
king's head man to release you.

151
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,181
You've got many friends

152
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:39,985
who are very anxious
to see your bondage end.

153
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,687
Friends who pay men like me

154

to get men like you
out of places like this.

155
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:49,928
So, what do you say,
Mr. Strong?

156
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,632
Would you like to go home?

157
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,685
Mrs. Strong?

158
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,687
I'm closing up for the night.

159
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,623
Mr. DeJong asks I send the rum
down to the cellar at 10:00.

160
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,258
No, that's fine.

Tomorrow, then, all right?
Somewhere private. Our tree or...

to sell to Maarten DeJong.

And tomorrow he expects
me to work all day.

I'm going to New York
to sell your crop.

I need you to pose as...

- Your wife?
- Yeah.

189
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,772
So you can sell off the last
of my husband's estate?

190
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,240
No, it's the only way
into the city, all right?

- Excuse me, Miss Anna?

196
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,136
I told you, Abigail promised to
keep an eye out in New York.

I am gonna kill him.
That lying...

202
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,019
Caleb didn't lie to you, I did.

203
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,992
He and Ben took Simcoe captive,

204
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:12,263
but Simcoe got freed somehow.

205
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,736
And so you lied to me

206
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:21,339
so that I would stay the
course for the cause.

207

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

We're glad to have you.

Major Hewlett apologizes that he
couldn't be here in person to greet you.

214
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,234
But he asks that you proceed to
Whitehall and give your report.

215
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,944
Conspiracy?

<i>Simcoe:
I'm afraid so.</i>

217
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:38,817
Whilst enduring torture at the
hands of my rebel captors,

218
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,987
I managed to wheedle out the fact that
they hailed from Setauket itself.

219
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,089
<i>- Setauket?
- By your leave,</i>

220
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,826
I'd like to conduct an inquiry

221
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,328
beginning with the family names

223
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,135
Yes, very well.

224
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,471
But tread lightly.

225
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,340
Lightly?

226
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,010
The tactics which we employed
on our first days here

227
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,513
are no longer to be tolerated.

228
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,450
We must show these people that
we are better than the rebels.

229
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:16,988
We must win the battle
for their hearts and minds.

Uh, no.
I haven't... he's not.

Uh, I believe...

239
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,413
I believe it was a gift
for the household.

240
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,549
A gift? From whom?

241
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,056
Mrs. Strong.

242
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,033
She was here?

He had to report
to Hewlett first.

264
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:06,090
Abe, if Simcoe at all
puts together

265
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,360
a suspicion about
what led to the ambush,

266
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,230
maybe you should flee now while
you still have a chance.

Flee?

268

Leave Long Island?
And do what? Go where?

I say we finish the job

A simple note could

And then a robbery on the road.

Abraham was not obliged.

He loves you.

306
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,761
Anna Strong was
a childish infatuation.

You are his wife.

308

All wives want to be
with their husbands.

Perhaps if Anna can be reunited
with hers, then I can be with mine.

Wait, wait, wait.

323
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,932
No, wait, wait.

324
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,533
Okay.

325
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,935
If you have
a grievance with me,

326
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,670
I suggest that we
settle this lawfully

327
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,405
with Major Hewlett, all right?

328
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,773
We'll settle it now.

329
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,043
( Yells, gasping )

330
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,614
( laughing )

331
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,484
You prefer to strike
at the wound, don't you?

332
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:30,554
That explains why you forced
yourself on her at Christmas.

333
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,823
- What?
- When her spirits were low.

334
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,826
Ow!

335
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,462
( Choking )

336
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:42,466
( grunting )

337
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,872
Mr. Woodhull!
Mr. Woodhull!

338
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:49,640
Mr. Woodhull.

339
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,610
Apologies, Captain.
Direct order from the major.

340
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,346
Your father's looking for you.

341
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,847
It's an emergency.

342
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,450
I have to bring Mr. Woodhull
to the magistrate away...

343
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,585
er, straightaway.

344
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,391
Emergency?

345
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,727
Isn't that what you'd call it?

346
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,029
He attacked me first.

347
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,465
You all saw that.

348
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,833
Yes?

349
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,836
Saw what, sir?

350
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,012
<i>Caleb: There's definitely something
going on between those two.</i>

351
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,748
I just don't know what.

352
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,519
You know, when I suggested
that he take Anna to New York

353
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,688
to get past the checkpoint,

354
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,490
he got very upset.

355
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:42,893
Anyway, I suppose
none of this is our concern.

356
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,895
They're my only two agents
on Long Island.

357
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,498
If there's trouble between
them, I want to know about it.

358
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,034
Well, how's about you jump
on a whaleboat with me, Major?

359
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,403
Get your arse
out of this woodpile?

360
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,038
( Sighs ) I'd like to.

361
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,541
Washington needs me here.
Compiling.

362
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,377
That and there's
Sackett's homework...

363
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:01,078
tradecraft, as he calls it.

364
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,114
I feel like I'm back
in school again.

365
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:06,417
Yeah? See, this is
exactly the reason why

366
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,452
I've been careful
to avoid success.

367
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:09,653
( Chuckles )

368
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:12,156
- Sir?
- "Sir," he says.

369
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,525
I have an urgent report
from the provost marshal.

370
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:17,428
He thought perhaps you'd like to see
the latest prisoner exchange proposal.

371
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,797
Thank you, Corporal.

372
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,806
- What is it?
- Samuel.

373
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,542
It's Samuel.
He's alive.

374
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,877
He's being released.

375
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,712
<i>( Caleb laughs )</i>

376
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,481
Sammy boy!
Huh? Huh?

377
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,016
When do we go get him?

378
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,818
I...
( sighs )

379
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,720
oh, I have to report
to Washington tomorrow.

380
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,655
Oh, come on. He'll
release you for this.

381
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,524
No, he won't.

382
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,426
He'd consider it
special treatment.

383
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,428
There are other men's
brothers on that list.

384
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,563
All right.
Well, I'll pick him up.

385
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:54,965
Yeah, I'll go and get Samuel

386
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,101
and then I'll bring him
back straight here.

387
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,836
Actually, I'll get him
drunk first.

388
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,772
No, I'll get him drunk
and then I'll get him a screw.

389
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,940
Wait, Caleb.

390
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,842
Yeah?

391
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,511
Thank you.

392
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:10,848
Hey, what are
brothers for, right?

393
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,086
( Sighs )

394
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:24,728
Captain Simcoe.

395
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,834
Step forward.

396
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:37,975
Mr. Woodhull,
what are you doing here?

397
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,877
The law requires it.

398
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,681
<i>Hewlett: I had hoped my words
to you had been clear...</i>

399
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:46,050
respect one's host.

400
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,154
<i>Simcoe: I agree.</i>

401
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,122
Then I learned
from Ensign Baker

402
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:55,559
that Mr. Woodhull had assaulted
the virtue of a lady...

403
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,761
Mrs. Anna Strong.

404
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,935
I assume you
divulged that, too.

405
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,140
- It was...
- Yes?

406
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,978
What I saw between
Mr. Woodhull and Mrs. Strong

407
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,847
was entirely inappropriate,

408
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,250
and I told him
as much at the time.

409
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,719
But he did not rape her.

410
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:29,193
So far as I could tell,
the dalliance was consensual.

411
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,599
He must've initiated it, then.

412
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:36,800
It was not against her wishes.

413
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:40,671
- This is shameful.
- Yes.

414
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:46,210
Major, abuse of any kind

415
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,279
<i>is abhorrent to me,</i>

416
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:51,015
<i>and when I heard
of a lady in distress,</i>

417
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:52,583
I leapt to her defense.

418
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:55,786
<i>It now appears
I may have been rash.</i>

419
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,087
Appears?

420
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,657
And if that is the case,

421
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:03,327
I apologize sincerely
to Mr. Woodhull.

422
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,768
It appears that neither
is in the right or the wrong.

423
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,572
This has all been a terrible
misunderstanding, Richard.

424
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,207
<i>I'm sure we can agree</i>

425
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:20,578
to make an exception
in this case

426
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,148
<i>as long as Abraham
accepts the apology.</i>

427
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,716
Now, shake on it.

428
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,380
Woodhull!

429
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:58,148
Wait!

430
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,155
Are you satisfied?

431
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,828
Neither am I...

432
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,998
which is why I propose
we settle this decisively.

433
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,899
What's between us
cannot be settled.

434
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,102
Of course, it can.

435
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,404
With a duel.

436
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,174
- A duel?
- Between gentlemen.

437
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:26,677
Two pistols.
Somewhere private.

438
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,012
Choose Baker as your second

439
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,913
and I'll select the most
discreet man I know.

440
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:32,783
- Yeah, I know what a duel is.
- Of course you do.

441
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,252
Or shall you
run and tell Father?

442
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,292
Or shall you
pretend to manhood?

443
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,429
( Whispers )
You know I'll never stop.

444
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,233
I accept.

445
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,074
Apology accepted.

446
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:08,185
<i>( Singing drunkenly )</i>

447
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,978
Ale, please.

448
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,150
Captain Simcoe.

449
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,122
Let me fetch it.

450
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,423
( Singing continues )

451
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,831
( breathing heavily )

452
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,869
<i>- Simcoe: I apologize, Mrs. Strong, for my tardiness.
- ( gasps )</i>

453
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:02,306
I suppose it's too late
to pick up my laundry?

454
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:08,746
You don't remember?

455
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:13,117
I feared we would
never see you again.

456
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,186
I always knew I'd see you.

457
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:20,190
<i>In fact, I could never have
endured such ill treatment</i>

458
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,359
<i>had I not clung onto
the hope of one day</i>

459
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:26,530
resuming our close
friendship we embarked upon.

460
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,503
I'm so relieved...

461
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,272
to hear of your survival.

462
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:43,180
And...

463
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,050
now that you've returned...

464
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,456
there's something

465
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,992
I've been meaning
to discuss with you.

466
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,927
Oh?

467
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,132
My husband's imprisonment

468
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,535
has cost me

469
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:07,137
Strong Manor,

470
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:12,109
this tavern,
and my status in the town.

471
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,077
And yet...

472
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:20,117
there's something
I cling to, as you did.

473
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,355
My honor.

474
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,597
And while I remain
a married woman,

475
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,501
I ask your help
safeguarding it.

476
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,373
Absolutely.

477
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:51,381
Tomorrow at dawn
at the millpond,

478
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:54,952
I intend to avenge it.

479
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,189
You no longer need to worry

480
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,426
about unwelcome advances
from inebriated farmers.

481
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,628
I'll see to that.

482
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:18,976
Abe!

483
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,015
Luke!

Jeremiah!

00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,085
Mrs. Anna.

486
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,420
Luke, I can't find Abraham.
Where is he?

487
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,290
- I thought him home.
- No, no one's home.

488
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:35,225
No one's answering the door
and his horse is gone.

489
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,593
Did he say he
was going anywhere?

490
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:38,161
No.

491
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,498
He was shooting.

492
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,570
On that old scarecrow
over there.

493
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:50,140
Taking shots with some old
rusty pistol he had.

494
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,510
Don't think he hit it, though.

495
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,345
Maybe that's why he mad.

496
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,547
No.

497
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,390
<i>( Footsteps descending stairs )</i>

498
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:09,026
Judge Woodhull, I'm sorry
to barge in at this hour,

499
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,494
but I desperately
need your help.

500
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,063
- It's taken care of.
- It is?

501
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:14,665
After conferring
with Major Hewlett,

502
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,466
who is also sympathetic
to your plight,

503
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,202
we have agreed to pardon
your husband on one condition.

504
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,405
That he signs an agreement
not to challenge

505
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:24,608
the attainder
following his release.

506
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,378
Yes, yes, and you
will make sure he signs it.

507
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,080
No, no, that's not
why I'm here.

508
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,015
You need to get dressed.
I'll explain on the way.

509
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,351
You'll explain it right now.

510
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:37,487
Your son has made
a terrible mistake

511
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:41,191
and unless you hurry, he's going
to pay for it with his life.

512
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,677
Should you lose
the coin toss, remember,

513
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,713
it is not considered
cowardly to turn aside

514
00:33:02,715 --> 00:33:05,182
to present your adversary
with a smaller target.

515
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:08,085
That is perhaps the best way
to think of the captain...

516
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:10,253
as merely a target.

517
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,609
I know you must be concerned
about killing a man

518
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,378
<i>for the first time today.</i>

519
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,148
Let me reassure you.
It's very unlikely to happen.

520
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,386
Well, there's
a first for everything.

521
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:44,287
Indeed.

522
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:50,594

Get on with it, man.

Soldier:
Congratulations.

Mr. Woodhull, you will have the
opportunity to draw first blood.

My turn.

I want you to know, Woodhull,

539
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,601
that whilst I've killed
many such as you...

( clicks )

541
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,440
...I shall treasure
this particular encounter.

542
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,879
Of course, I may

543
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,481
just decide

544
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,350

<i>Richard:

What do you think you're doing?

547
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,865
This doesn't concern you!

548
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,370
Do it.

549
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,573
Sir, I can't let you interfere.

550
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,242
Mr. Woodhull
has had his shot.

551
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:28,345
- This is an affair of honor.
- Whose honor? Mine?

552
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:30,547
Because I assure you,
it is not my honor

553
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,649
that has been offended here.

554
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,585
It seems far more likely
that it is your own honor...

555
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:39,256
yours and yours, sirs,
that is at stake here.

556
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:41,024
I am prepared
to receive your fire.

557

Please, John.

558
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,899
As I told you, I'm a married
woman before the law.

559
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:54,804
What happened at Christmas
was a mistake...

560
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,974
for which
we were both at fault.

561
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:01,278
<i>I swear, sir. There is
nothing between us.</i>

562

It is over.

563

<i>We have both
returned to our vows</i>

564

until fate
determines otherwise.

565
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:13,323
Fate?

566
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:16,760
No one knows
what the future may bring.

567
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,361
But if you go through
with this now,

568
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:21,531
I don't know what
our fate here can be.

Mr. Woodhull, you can stop
now with your honor intact.

Just load the pistol.

- Mr. Woodhull...
- Load the pistol.

This is my battle.

580
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:17,420
I don't need your protection.

581

Protection?
I will show you no mercy!

then for your wife,

This is about more than you!

Hey, ain't Rangers
supposed to range?

591

On the back of a horse, say?

592
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:43,706
Best if nobody hears us coming.

593
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:47,544
Especially our good friend,

It seems possible that you
could manage a smile.

598
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:21,544
After I convince him
to sign away his property.

599
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,913
Is that why you're upset?

600
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,117
You should've killed Simcoe
when you had the chance.

601
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,021
You were the one that was
trying to talk me out of it.

602
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:35,925
That was to save you. Then
Simcoe gave you an opening.

603
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,037
You heard my father.
He would've prosecuted me.

604
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,508
( Scoffs ) You can't tell
a bluff when you hear it?

605

Your father would've done
everything he could to protect you.

606
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,816
Simcoe made the challenge, so the

So let's get about it.

She's off
to retrieve her husband

the rest of their crop.
