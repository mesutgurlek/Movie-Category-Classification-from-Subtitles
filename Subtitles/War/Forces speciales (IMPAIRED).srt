I'm afraid.

169
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,846
Do not be afraid
Did you hear?

170
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,885
Do not show fear.

171
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,485
They could kill us, but will not
can win. Got it?

172
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,084
... Commander, captain.

173
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,282
Commander!

174
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,651
Sit back.

175
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,687
As you can see we have
snipers.

176
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,370
New and sophisticated.

177
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,970
How is your accuracy?

178
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,999
Three hundred yards to kill rabbits.

179
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,651
Good / Killer!

180
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,524
There are two news - good and bad.

181
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,370
Worst case:
rabbit for dinner.

182
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,625
The sad part:
hostage in Pakistan's tribal areas.

183
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,082
Damaging your birthday!

184
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,851
The good news is
It is the duty of intelligence.

185
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,799
Finally, at the shelter
... and not at the scene.

186
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,847
Have a question?

187
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,638
Of course. Elsa Casanova a journalist who
covering our presence in Afghanistan.

188
00:20:22,673 --> 00:20:26,567
Another question / Yes!
Does that mean good?

189
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,882
Do not shoot! I beg you!

190
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,285
Why not ask if
you want to interview me?

191
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,882
It would be more civilized than
like this.

192
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,891
Civilized?

193
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,244
You call me "The Butcher of Kabul".

194
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,045
"The worst enemy of Afghan women"

195
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,085
Is not that
the title of your last article?

196
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,082
What are you doing at Maina?

197
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,283
What I did at Maina?

198
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,407
What lies you tell him?

199
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,768
I know who you are.

200
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,691
Your family, so beautiful,

201
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,564

What my invite
to my country

00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,582
to spread democracy with
muzzle on my people?

210
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,605
Better than selling
daughter of twelve years.

211
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,605
Did not interview questions derived from
the person holding the camera.

212
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,885
I am sure the next question
very precise.

213
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,891
Do you believe in God?

214
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,880
Yes, I believe in God.

215
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,162
Harsh!

216
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,401
I can not read this.

LOOK!

219
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,040
Leave him!

Do not do that! Please!

There was little change.

What are the chances of success?

Many of our brethren think
You do not deserve trust.

No, I can prove?

I prefer the glory, but from
The Almighty.

I am a faithful servant of Shura.

If you hear me, go!

322
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,888
No, I will keep them
until they arrive.

323
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,005
What happened here?

324
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,170
Zaef!
Commando comes to pick them up!

325

This their equipment!

326
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,368
They did not give me a choice!

327
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,405
Start by carrying the head
snipers here! Now!

328
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,371
Now! Go!
Go!

329
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,761
Beat them soon!

330
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,962
Stop.

331
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,289
We lost two portable devices.

332
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,971
And this.

333
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,799
The helicopter will come anyway.

334
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,881
Show me your hands.

335
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,999
Slow down.

336
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,525
Ok.

337
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,443
Everything will be okay,
relaxed.

338
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,244
Stay near me.

339
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,999
Hold on to my backpack
Do you agree?

340
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,764
Ok / Good.

341
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,799
Your hands.

342
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,486
Thank you.

343
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,807
Go away.

344
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,085
Kinda hard to break.

345
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,925
Take cover behind the stone.

346
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,767
Check position / Coordinates?

347
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,929
36 North, 72 East.

348
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,607
We meet them behind the mountains.

349
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,799
will not fail to meet
at the rendezvous point.

350
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,040
Send emergency signs?

351
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,999
The Taliban can also be intercepted.

352
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,199
Message sent.

353
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,486
You go ahead, Marius.

354
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,045
Ok.

355
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,286
Where we are / We explain later?

356
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,845
Can I help you?

357
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,399
Yes, give him a gun and radio.

358
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,121
Look who's here!

359
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,451
Leader and his friends!

360
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,399
Damn, the whole army!

361
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,767
Trei, my friend!

362
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,087
What would it / they were angry.

363
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,562
Let's play!

364
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,887
not yet ... not yet ...

365
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,205
Now!

366
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,605
Do not know why, but every time we
press harder.

367
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,690
It's just because I'm a psychiatrist.

368
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,799
Shut up and do it.

369
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,371
Marius.

370
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,004
May I help you?

371
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,087
You must replace the bandages.

372
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,088
Must be at sewing.

373
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,043
Of course,

374
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,599
Approximate position of 22 km,
The highest point in the butt!

375
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,602
Note the language
There is a lady with us.

376
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,844
Sorry, too hot.

377
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,205
I remind
I am not happy with the needle.

378
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,285
Are you ready?

379
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,565
You all right?

380
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,490
Good ... All right.

381
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,370
Sign of relief.

382
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,999
twenty miles from the point.

383
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,081
Your turn?

384
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,249
Not in place.

385
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,482
Half-hour break.

386
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,646
Helicopters?

387
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,682
They have set up a meeting point.

388
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,846
Okay?

389
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,799
Sorry, already
3 days we did not eat.

390
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,450
Hopefully not too much trouble.

391
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,048
So, what do you do
had hit him.

392
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,085
Critics of the war,
the soldiers do not like.

393
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,961
and sew the rest?

394
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,286
Vezak stitched ... ?

395
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,163
It / Who would have thought.

396
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,199
Your analysis is very interesting.

397
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,770
Thank you.

398
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,040
I say that I agree with him.

399
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,607
It's our job, not politics.

400
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,930
It seems so hot / What is it?

401
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,568
Our taxi will be delayed.

402
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,599
there for ten minutes.

403
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,365
Damn!

404
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,687
Evacuation failed.

405
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,322
Wake up!

406
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,047
This is a failure.

407
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,570
does not appear.

408
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,491
One helicopter made an emergency landing
with the shot.

409
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,965
Hostages?

410
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,641
There is still no news about them.

411
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,242
Addons Day 2 </ i>

412
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,805
We need to stop,
they were on the edge.

413
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,528
Stop.

414
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,769
Do you have a plan "B"?

415
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,929
No, we do not have a plan "B".

416
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,284
What will he decide?

417
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,243
Do not know.

418
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,681
No, I'm sure we'll like it.

419
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,691
Hey, Satnièe
Victor!

420
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,522
Eat up.

421
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,891
Thank you.

422
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,967
Commander,
what will we do?

423
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,005
Waters to Afghanistan
one door and it's there!

424
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,367
Do you mind /
What are you talking about?

425
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,405
The command is to bring you
we will do ...

426
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,805
Is there a better idea?

427
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,885
The best moment of fame,
but forget about eternity ...

428
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,046
Every minute the possibility
of their is reduced.

429
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,199
Do not fail
keep looking.

430
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,885
Full power.

431
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,799
How did you get here?

432
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,245
Parachute.

433
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,681
Understand well with what I mean.

434
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,165
Finally!

435
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,999
Been wondering when I would
woke up as a journalist?

436
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,968
What drives you?

437
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,890
How I ended up with the gang
in uniform?

438
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,571
No, I do not want to ask.

439
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,599
Better!
The soldiers would not be a genius!

440
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,999
You're too well.

441
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,049
Are you married?

442
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,367
Now not.

443
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,210
Do you want coffee?

444
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,599
What do / You know that's impossible.

445
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,251
Want to wait?

446
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,886
I hope you know what you're doing.

447
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,570
So do I.

448
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,399
You're very brave.

449
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,165
What is courage?

450
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,044
There is a brave woman
in the village.

451
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,999
Before the shoot, looking faces ...

452
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,765
I know what it was then?

453
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,485
laughter on their faces ...

454
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,399
And I do what?

455
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,405
No one.

456
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,605
Sorry, but we
just chatting.

457
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,799
Are you okay?

458
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,211
Yes.

459
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,889
Addons 3rd DAY </ i>

460
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,890
Tic-Tac.

461
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,242
Protect.

462
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,762
What can be relied upon / What?

463
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,280
Reliable? Yes or no?

464
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:08,085
The whole family were massacred by the Taliban.
Is that enough?

465
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,049
You know how to use it?

466
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,886
Is clear.

467
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,280
Thank you.

468
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,643
They will not give us
the opportunity.

469
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,086
will not let us pass.

470
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,168
So it seems.

471
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,999
Elsa? Why so angry?

472
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,241
This is a question of honor.

473
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,169
Sorry, do not you understand.

474
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,886
Not wanting to disturb, but they
getting closer!

475
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,965
He will not give up.

476
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,889
He needs me more than life.

477
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,082
The more the better.

478
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,960
Ignore. Let's go.

479
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,002
Slow down.

480
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,199
Damn, we were tortured for three days.

481
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,205
I agree. Are not you tired?

482
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,599
You. Stay with him.

483
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,364
Yes, sir.

484
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,887
Start Shoot!

485
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:26,049
Shoot, shoot!

486
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,730
Shoot! Shoot!

487
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,805
This! This!

488
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,609
Again!

489
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,690
Forward!

490
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,811
Change!

491
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,884
Go! !

492
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,411
Change! / It!

493
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,521
How! The attacks!

494
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,041
Attack!

495
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,765
They're like the devil!

496
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,399
You mean all attacks!

497
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,050
Why?

498
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,085
Hindu Kush Mountains
will kill this woman.

499
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,399
Look what you said?

500
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,926
Okli!

501
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,600
Western women
harder than you think!

502
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,810
Exit all!

503
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,049
All-out attack!

504
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,168
Addons Day 4 </ i>

505
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,565
We're in big trouble.

506
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,399
"How can there be a failure"?

507
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,210
"Defense helpless"

508
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,123
Whatever you do!

509
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,685
I am sure there will be for us
in the mountains when to give up.

510
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,444
Friends or Enemies?

511
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,650
Passed at an altitude of five kilometers.

512
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,604
needs food and rest.

513
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,124
Say, they will succeed?

514
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,121
All he does is
wise ...

515
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,891
Ask for comfort ...

516
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,085
It is never rejected.
On the enemy though.

517
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,570
It is traditional.

518
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,529
Next time I'll wear a tie.

519
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,399
Assalamualaikum!

520
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,405
Greetings!

521
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,685
Ask him where the children?

522
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:18,685
This summer the Taliban, they take all
and 17 adults.

523
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,161
Why?

524
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,248
Entered into madrassas.

525
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,285
Then it will return to
implementation of Sharia doctrine.

526
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,843
Not surprisingly,
they do not like it.

527
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:39,799
So should you?

528
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,404
Good. Take it.

529
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,965
This is not nothing.

530
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,480
Maybe you will need?

531
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,091
Ok. Thank you.

532
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,399
Look!

533
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,799
Amen wear a suit!

534
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,484
Like a king.

535
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,170
Bravo!

536
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,804
Come on! Give the hat / Take it!

537
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,199
You're like a sponge!
I warned you.

538
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,806
Kovacs! !

539
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,764
Here / Throw!

540
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,246
Throw it high!

541
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,486
High!

542
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,804
Take, friends,
does not fit!

543
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,847
Take cover! Hide! / In the shelter! Faster!

544
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,481
Quick! All to the shelter!
Hide!

545
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,401
Marius! No!

546
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,399
He's dead, dead!

547
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,084
Victor, faster!

548
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,246
Leave him!

549
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,806
Is dead! Take it easy!

550
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,331
Go, go!

551
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,724
Hide behind the wall!

552
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:55,922
Want to pray for Marius?

553
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,603
An honor.

554
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,843
Addons Day 5 </ i>

555
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,370

Wait! Wait!

we parted,
I had to stay.

558
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,205
If you should die in the mountains,
prefer to die here.

559
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:32,085
Searched the house! Quick!

This, too!

561

May God protect you.

562
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,289
Thank you for saving my life.

563
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,561
I'll go with him.

564
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,921
Amen! Wait!
Please, friend!

565
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,110
Amen! We can not leave it there.

566
01:01:47,145 --> 01:01:49,041
Do not be a martyr.

567
01:01:49,076 --> 01:01:51,362
This man has given us
comfort, are now all going to die!

568
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,882
No matter! Marius died, and

We will not take the risk because
This farmer!

570
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,490
Coward! Even for me!

571
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,999
This chicken will go with them.

572
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,365
It should not be!

573
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,085
Luke! Stay with her new boyfriend.

574

We will save these people.

Not the first time I heard.

Wait, friend! Wait / Elijah you want to wait?

628

Stop!

Sit back.

633
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,765
Leave me!

634
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,961
Leave me! Leave!

635
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,799
Only if you're already dead.

636

Survived why. Let the

Ok.

639
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,001
Furthermore, we can not go.

Started snowing.

643
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,599
Temperatures continue to drop.

644
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:07,965
This is not good.

645
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,721
Everything will be fine!
Everything will be fine!

646
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,402
We must find shelter.

647

01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,966
Choking!

We have to open his mouth!

01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,565
Give, give!

660
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,321
OK, Victor, already.
Wait, wait!

All, I'll kill you all!

You're not even human!

666
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,361
How are you?

667
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,241
I'm almost gone, right?

668
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,966
It's important that you get back.

669
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,083
Tic-Tac, nine years ago,
lost his wife.

670

No!

677

What do you do?

678
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,885
How many of us have to die, only
to understand that we will not be found?

679
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:02,443
Who's next
You or me?

680
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,199
What do you want?

681
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,362
Stop it!

682
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,799
Enough! Stop it!

683
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,848
Enough!

684
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:18,205
Nothing can save you
I will stay here!

685
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,282
Do you have children?

686
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,765
No.

687
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,805
Why not go home,
have children ... a lot.

688
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,571
Listen carefully.
Lisa was expecting a baby!

689
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,605
So I have to discharge her
to her husband!

690
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,887
I do not have children.

691
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,529
What is this a request?

692
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,805
No, seriously
The road has been connected to us.

693
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,441
So you'll be a father?

694
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,324
Yes, old boy!

695
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:15,442
Addons Day-8 </ i>

696
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,370
Where are we?

697
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,089
Help me!

698
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,450
Here.

699
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,050
Damn it.

700
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:44,199
Damn, why did you let
so long?

701
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,884
because of the honor.

702
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,840
Finally!

703
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,009
Unfortunately you did not hear
the compliment!

704
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,799
Do not look,
turn around!

705
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,125
Everything will be fine.

706
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,282
You know what was said Victor
before he died?

707
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,130
I love my job ...

708
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,409
Addons Day 9 </ i>

709
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,326
How can let reporters
living in this dangerous country?

710
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,199
I love this country.

711
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,283
Replace it with the Dutch
would be better.

712
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,685
Why the Netherlands?

713
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:59,691
Datar.

714
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,201
As we here?

715
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,082
I have a choice
here or the Netherlands.

716
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:07,805
Biram Netherlands.

717
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,491
Yes, but there are obvious.

718
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,050
Delicatessen!

719
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,811
Delicious!

720
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,480
I am at Italian restaurants.

721
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:22,366
Special place.
Svidjet will like it.

722
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:26,405
risotto with large white sponge.

723
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:33,121
Maybe in another life.

724
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,689
Since we are not at home?

725
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,405
Do not worry, everything is
would be fine.

726
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,929
The enemy! The enemy!
Take cover!

727
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,764
No!

728
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,606
Luke!

729
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,121
Luke! Luke!

730
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:36,007
It was not you who decide your fate ...

731
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:09,885
Luke! All is well!
Okay.

732
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,050
No!

733
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,362
Do not die! Do not die!

734
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,606
Do not die! Luke!

735
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,726
It happened so fast ...

736
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,890
No!

737
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,241
No! No!

738
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,805
Why, Luke?
Why, why?

739
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,331
Addons Day 10 </ i>

740
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,723
Stay with me.

741
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,005
Three miles in two hours.

742
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:29,283
Last shortcut?

743
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:33,291
To the border.

744
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:36,490
Welcome to Afghanistan.

745
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,564
Beware!

746
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:12,923
Pull!

747
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,130
Oh my God!

748
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,767
Normal.

749
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,567
Elsa,

750
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,888
You should continue without us.

751
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,524
Take it / No, no.

752
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:20,090
I will not leave
you are here.

753
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:23,647
Hear ...

754
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,126
We'll catch up.

755
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:32,285
Please take this.

756
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,087
Take this compass.

757
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,291
Take, Elsa.

758
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:57,405
Go to the west, Elsa
Did you hear? Just to the west.

759
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,525
Got it.

760
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:02,325
I can not leave
you are here.

761
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:05,170
Yes, I was going to do it ..

762
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:08,199
Sorry, but I can not.

763
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,204
Elsa, not for myself,
but for others.

764
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:17,599
Go home, otherwise
will all be in vain.

765
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,888
Go back home!

766
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,604
Go!

767
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,806
I'll warn them.

768
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,799
What do you call?

769
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:07,007
Apollo!

770
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,531
I like it ...

771
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,124
It would be wise.

772
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,801
I'll be rich!

773
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,045
I'll be back!

774
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:04,889
It will not be in vain!

01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,162
He's still alive!

779
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:43,599
Tonight you'll be in Paris.

780
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,965
I do not want to leave Kabul.

781
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,650
Get real,
you were sick?

782
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,842
I will fly until they are found.

783
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,566
The people from the military hospital
will take care of you.

784
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,081
military hospital.

785
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,451
They have to find them!

786
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:00,007
Please help ... Excuse me ...
Ooops! ?

787
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,764
Want to ride / Yes!

788
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,531

Small streets!

Admiral!

790
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,644
Yes, I know, Mr. Minister.

791
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,126
Thank you.

792
01:38:25,160 --> 01:38:26,241
For what?

793
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:30,365
I was saved.
