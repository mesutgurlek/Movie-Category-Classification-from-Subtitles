-I've a message for him.

- All right.
- I'm going in, son,
I'll show you the way.

00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,133
Right, thank you.

Go and find Private Clark,
and send him here at once,
will you?

12
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,267

But Mrs. Beaton says
stir slowly.

16
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,967
I have told you a hundred
times that your Mrs. Beeton

17
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:27,533
Was a savage. A barbarian!

18
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,800
To make this souffle...
Give me an egg,
I will show you.

19
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:33,767
An egg? Don't you know
there's a war on?

20
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,600
(SCOFFS) I seem to have
heard something about it.

21
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:36,933
Raoul? Just a minute.

22
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,200
Lunch is almost ready.

23
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:42,100
Would've been ready hours ago
if Captain Carnot had left it
to Mrs. Beeton.

24
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:45,667
Now I understand
why the English will never,
never learn to cook.

25

Well!

26

And who invented roast beef,
if you please?

What is it?

28
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,500
Mackenzie didn't get back,
so we're off tonight.

29
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,933
Just had this from HQ.

30
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,200
- We are taking Captain Gowan
and Private Clark with us?
- Sure.

31
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:05,700
I'd hate to go on a trip
like this without Nobby Clark.

32
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,267
Besides, he knows that part of
the country as well as you do.

33
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,200
Man's well-read. I believe
he's got Indian blood
in his veins.

34
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:12,600
He can smell his way about.

Yes, I'm looking
forward to it.

38

So am I, except
it's going to be a bit tricky.

39
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,133
It will be odd going back.

about the place.

41

keep my temper.
- I'll watch you.

42
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,133
- You sent for me, sir?
- PETER: Yes.

43
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,933
- You know Saint-Antoine,
don't you?
- Yes, sir.

44
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,700
- Think you could find your
way there from the coast?
- Yes, sir.

45
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,500
Why?

46
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:43,500
Well, I haven't told you
before, but that's
where we're going.

47
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,633
We're never going to
Saint-Antoine.

48
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,733
Well, that's where
my old woman lives.

49
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,267
Yes, I know.

50
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,267
- Well, don't you want to
see her again?
- No, thank you very much, sir.

51
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,367
You see, it's one of the joys
of this here war that
I can't see her again.

52
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:58,733
- I'm sorry,
that's where we're going.
- Oh, it's not fair!

- Cigarette?
- Thank you very much, sir.

Of all the places
in the world,
they had to pick the one place

55
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:03,767
Where my old woman lives.

56
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,367
No, it's not right, sir.

57
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:07,967
- Well, don't worry about it,
I'll get somebody else.
- Yes, sir.

58
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,133
- Sir?
- Yes?

59
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,067
Sir...

60
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:15,933
It ain't safe to
go without me.

61
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,967
I suppose I'll have to go
with you.

62
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,067
It's a great sacrifice, mind.

63
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:23,300
- See, I'm putting my head
in a noose.
- Well, that's excellent.

64
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,800
- Hello, Red.
- Hello, Raoul. Hello, Peter.

65
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,500
Hello. You been telephoning
your blonde?

66
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,567
No, that's all washed up.

67
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,567
She's taking this austerity
business too seriously.

68
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,767
You know, you ought to have
joined the Air Force, they're
much more successful.

69
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,133
Oh, I get along, sir,
I get along.

70
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,800
I met a little redhead
last night,
and she's got everything.

71
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:42,400
At least I think she has.

72
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,900
- When will you know?
- She's dining with me tonight.

73
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,767
- No, she's not.
- No? Why?

74
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,500
Because we're going
on a little trip,
and it's a stag party.

75

(COUGHING)

76
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,700
Um, excuse me, sir?

77
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,633
If it's all the same with you,
I should like to be back for
the 3:00 Saturday.

78
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,800
- I've got a cert running
at Newmarket.
- What do you know?

79
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:13,900
Gay Gabby.
Should start at any price.
I know a jockey.

80
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:16,100
Never trust a jockey.

81
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,200
You're speaking of
my late profession, sir.

82
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,967
You're a bit large for
a jockey, aren't you?

83
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:23,967
Well, I wasn't exactly
a jockey.

84
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,233
I used to lead the horses
around the paddock, and that.

85
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh. I'm very sorry, Nobby.

86
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,200
Forgiven and forgotten, sir.

87
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:33,500
- Well, how are we?
- Fine.

88
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,233
I had much worse crossings
in the old days.

89
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,233
Yes, seems like a rather
long time ago now, doesn't it?

90
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,067
- How near are we?
- We're pretty near.
Coming up on deck?

91
00:06:45,233 --> 00:06:47,067
- Ship's stopped, sir.
- Right.

92
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,767
- Cut through the minefield,
all right.
- Good.

93
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:55,700
- You been at this long?
- About a year.

94
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:58,400
- It's a pretty good sport.
- Not for me,
I don't like mines.

95
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,200
- I'd be frightened to death.
- You soon get used to it.

96
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:03,200

over there?

- That's France.
- France!

come home like this.

Well, it's as far as
we go, sir.

the rest of the way.

I thought we'd have to swim
or something.

- I'd do the same for you again
one day, sir.

on the way back.

306
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:53,233
Raoul adores Violette.

307
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,700
He was always her favorite.

308
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,900
My other brother,
who is a prisoner of war
in Germany...

309
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:00,200
Brother?

310
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:02,600
- Isn't Raoul your husband?
- (LAUGHING) No.

311
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,833
What made you think that?

312
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,067
I don't really know.

313
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:11,233
- He's never spoken very much
about his family.
- No, he's my brother.

314
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,567
- You don't look very alike.
- No.

315
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:16,067
And we think differently
about many things.

316
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:19,200
Must be hell for you here.

317
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,600
*

318
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:32,533
That's so that
we do not forget ever
who is master here.

319
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,767
By day, we see them.

320
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:39,067
At night,
we just have to listen.

321
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,067
- Not coming here, is it?
- No.

322
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,833
It goes to the turn of the
road, and then comes back.

323
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,733
The Boche are very methodical.

324
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,067
- Calvados,
from our own cellar.
- Ah!

325
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,700
What else have
you got in there?

326
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,633
When the Boche come here
and began looting,

327
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,367
We hide all the valuable
things, like silver, linen,

328
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:04,467
And most valuable of all,
soap!

329
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,933
- Didn't we, Michele?
- Calvados!

330
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:08,467
We must drink a toast.

331
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:11,167
To Peter's first visit to
Chateau Carnot.

332
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:13,167
And to Raoul's homecoming.

333
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:16,067
You are home,

334
00:22:16,067 --> 00:22:19,600
-Aren't you, Raoul?
- No. Only for 48 hours,
then I have to go.

335
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,767
But why?

336
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:25,933
Well, I'm in
the Free French Army now.

337
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,133
- I'm over here for them.
- What for?

338
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,267
To find out about the
German Army, that's all.

339
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,300
You mean you're a spy?

340
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,733
Michele!

341
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,100
I'm sorry. I don't know what
I'm trying to say, you see...

342
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,300
It's two years
since you were home last.

343
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:43,800
I was so happy
I didn't even think.

344
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,233
You're in danger here.
You might be caught,

345
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,900
Anything might happen.
You must go now, before
morning. Please, Raoul!

346
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,133
Women are amazing, I must say.

347
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,167
First, she is angry with me
because I will not stay,

348
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,600
And now she tries to throw me
out as quickly as she can.

349
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:03,200
Monsieur, can you not
persuade him to go?

350
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,300
No, I'm afraid I can't.

351
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,400
You are the only one left.

352
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:11,467
Charles is a prisoner of war
in Germany. His wife is dead.

353
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:14,633
I am here working the estate
with only Violette and
Charles' son to help me.

354
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,500
You do not write to us.
We do not even know
if you're alive.

355
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:21,467
You come to visit us only now
when you wish to do some
spying for your new masters.

356
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,333
The English.

357
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,300
So the Boche have even got
you saying it?

358
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:27,800
You children must all
go to bed.

359
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:32,067
Monsieur Raoul, come and
help me with the blankets.
Without dropping them, now!

360
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,700
You follow me, monsieur.

361
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,700
We have no blackout
in the hall.

362
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,833
*

363
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,300
You must forgive
what I said, monsieur.

364
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,367
Things are very difficult
for us here.

365
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:20,267
You cannot know
what we have suffered.

366
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,233
- The cruelty, the humiliation.
- I think I understand.

367
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,867
I wish we could have met
in happier days.

368
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,300
I do, too.

369
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:35,300
- Not that way, stupid!
(LAUGHING)
- I was only trying to help!

370
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,467
Here is your room, monsieur.

371
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,933
I'm afraid
it is not very elegant.

372
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:44,100
- But I hope you will be safe.
- Thank you.

373
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:45,633
Good night, monsieur.

374
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,733
- I hope you will be
comfortable.
- Thank you.

375
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,167
- Raoul, no talking!
- (RAOUL LAUGHING)

376
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:52,367
Good night, Raoul.

377
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,233
There, there.

378
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,833
Michele, don't worry!

379
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,867
You shouldn't have come.

380
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:06,433
Good night, cherie.

381
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:11,800
- Good night.
-(VIOLETTE SUMMONING
IN FRENCH)

382
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:26,067
You know, she's right,
we shouldn't have come here.

383
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:38,333
Nobby!

384
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,133
- Have another quick one, sir.
- Thanks so much.

385
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,067
Come, my little pigeon.

386
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:44,933
(LAUGHING) Coming, my dear!

387
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,367
Good luck.

388
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,633
I'm doing it for my King
and country, sir.

389
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:15,833
(WHISPERING IN FRENCH)

390
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,067
So that is what
you wanted me to see.

391
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,467
As soon as the harvest is
over, they will go back
to the prison camp.

392
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,067
The defeated.

393
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,433
Now I know what
they look like.

394
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,933
Charles is a prisoner, too.
I wonder
if he looks like that.

395
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:56,167
Poor Charles.

396
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:59,367
I wish he were back here to
run this place.

397
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:01,500
It's much more than I can do
by myself.

398
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:04,800
But you have done marvelously!
I don't know how.

399
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:07,933
In the old days,
you were always in Paris,
buying dresses.

400
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,300
That is all forgotten now.

401
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:13,267
But, Raoul, listen to me
for a moment.

402
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:17,567
Does not any of this mean
anything to you at all?

403
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:19,500
This is our land, Raoul.

404
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,533
You cannot go away again
and leave it.

405
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,633
- I have work to do.
- Surely your work is here!

406
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,767
To nurse the land until
the Germans are thrown out.

407
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:30,633
- And be one of
that pathetic group?
- They are prisoners of war.

408
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,133
I think I could get you
papers from the Germans.

409
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,833
- They are easy to bribe.
- You do not face realities,
Michele.

410
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,700
Of course I love this land,
that's why I am fighting!

411
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:45,067
I want you here, Raoul.
I cannot carry on any longer
alone.

412
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,367
VIOLETTE: Michele! Michele!

413
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:50,700
Yes, Violette?

414
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:56,267
The Germans
have been here again.

415
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,333
- They are looking for you.
- Already?

416
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,067
I sent them away.

417
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:03,867
- Did they find the Englishman?
- Not while Violette is here.

418
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,267
- Raoul.
- Come.

419
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,667
I have made some coffee
for you.

420
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:09,533
(BOTH GREETING IN FRENCH)

421
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:14,267
Monsieur Raoul!

422
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:18,833
- Monsieur Raoul.
- Ah!

00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,533
(BOTH SPEAKING FRENCH)

424
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,433
- We ought to
get cracking soon.
- Ah...

425
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,833
The trouble is that good
coffee is wasted on you.

426
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:38,367
- Are you trying to flatter me,
Monsieur Raoul?
- Not at all, Violette.

427
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:41,433
I was going to say that
any coffee would taste good
after a year in England.

428
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,767
Who are you?

429
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,367
That's Daddy's brother.

430
00:28:48,733 --> 00:28:51,233
And that is
a very good friend.

431
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,833
Rene.

432
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,667
Perhaps today,
perhaps tomorrow,

433
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:58,533
The Germans will ask you
if you have seen either of us.

434
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,100
But you have not.

435
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:02,500
Do you understand?

436
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,433
We are fighting for France.

437
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,433
And if you can forget that you
have seen us, you will be
fighting for France, too.

438
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,867
- And you would like that,
wouldn't you?
- Yes.

439
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:17,067
Then you have never seen
this gentleman or myself.

440
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:19,667
- Not ever. See?
- Yes.

441
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,300
Come on, Raoul.

442
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:26,067
Goodbye, mademoiselle.
Thank you.

443
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:29,567
- I'm afraid I've been rather
a difficult sort of guest.
- Nonsense!

444
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:32,400
All our friends are welcome
here at any time, aren't they,
Michele?

445
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:33,633
Of course.

446
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,867
- Are you not coming back
tonight?
- No. It'd be too dangerous.

447
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,400
For you, I mean.

448
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:43,100
Don't worry about that.

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

- Another fine?

There was some more
de Gaulle signs put up
in the night.

457
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:31,333
I thought so.

458
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:35,200
It was very funny
this morning.

459

I met old Fayolle, and when
I ask him for some money,
he wouldn't give me any.

460
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,233
So I ask him again...

461
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:42,533
What are they saying?

462
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,733
I cannot hear.

it really was so funny
this morning...

What did she want?

469

She was collecting money for
the fine we will have to pay
after the raid last night.

470
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:12,267
All the German wires were cut.

471
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,067
That's what's called
passive resistance.

472
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:16,900
- You remember Old Fayolle?
- Fayolle, yes.

473
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:19,767
Well, Martine met him in the
street this morning,

474
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:24,667
And asked him if he would like
to contribute 30 pieces
of silver.

475
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:27,933
- What does that mean, exactly?
- You don't know Fayolle.

476
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:30,733
I was always urging the people
not to anger the Germans,

477
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,267
But Fayolle goes further.
Much further.

478
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,600
Before the war, no one minded
his Fascist ideas,

479
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:37,367
Nor when he joined
the Croix de Feu.

480
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:39,500
But nowadays he cooperates
with the Germans.

481
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,367
His daughter goes out
with them.

482
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:44,300
He has them to dine
in his house.
It's disgraceful.

483
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,633
- Fayolle used to be
a nice old boy.
- He's changed.

Come on, looks all right now.
Thank you, Violette.

We do not have many visitors
these days, do we, Estelle?

508
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,400
- The Germans are
scarcely visitors.
- Germans?

Yes.

They hate us in the village

- To a free France.
- ALL: To a free France.

517
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:57,600
Now, gentlemen,
what can I do for you?

518
00:33:57,667 --> 00:34:00,700
Monsieur Fayolle, you've been
very useful to us already.

519
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:03,933
But there's still one vital
matter on which you can
advise us.

520
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:06,667
It's obvious that the Germans
are concentrating troops
in this area.

521
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:10,167
Now, we want to find out
their strength, and roughly
their dispositions.

522
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:11,500
Can you help us?

523

I see.

524
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:20,167
So that if you can only find
the German centers of
resistance and crush them,

525
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:22,367
That will give you the coast.

526
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:24,433
- That's about it.
- Well...

527
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,733
German defenses are
on the box plan,
that is to say...

528
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,133
There is a big box there.

529
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,467
Little box here, little box
there, little box there,
little box there.

530
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:36,833
So that the little boxes
can be reinforced
from the big box.

531
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,200
Yes, but what we want is
more precise information.

532
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:41,833
Their exact strength.

533
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:45,067
Whether they've got armored
units, if they're using
reservists, and so on.

534
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:48,567
Gentlemen, if you want
the German order of battle,

535
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,833
You must go to
German headquarters.

536
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,533
German headquarters?

537
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,800
It'd be nice to
pay a call there.

538
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:57,900
You're not serious, monsieur!

539
00:34:57,967 --> 00:34:59,367
Well, Captain de Carnot
couldn't go, his German's
not good enough,

540
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:00,800
But I don't see
why I shouldn't.

541

do that.

Because I have been sensible
and helped the Germans,

552

to go outside the area.

I do that.

I do that. You see?

And makes
a clever sort of stamp.

Now remember, you came into
the military area yesterday.

The date is on this stamp.

560

Do they stop people
and ask them for papers much?

610
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:44,867
- I'm sorry,
we're just off on a job.
- Oh, go on, sir.

611
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:47,067
I'd risk death willingly to
get away from here.

612
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:49,067
No, you meet Captain de Carnot
as arranged.

613
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,800
Tell me.

614
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:54,367
How much champagne have you
got in your cellar?

615
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,533
- Why, you thinking of
buying the place?
- No, I'm not.

616
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,667
What a pity.
I'll let you have it cheap.

617
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:01,067
I want to get a hold of
as much champagne
as I can lay my hands on.

618
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,233
(SNIFFING)

619
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:10,833
Do I smell of mothballs?

620
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,100
(SNIFFING)

621
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:15,233
Well, if you do, I do.

622
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,867
Well, it's a bit longer in
the leg than I am.

623
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:18,900
Tops of my trousers come up
to my chest.

624
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:21,367
- Very painful.
- Mmm.

625
00:39:21,433 --> 00:39:23,667
Do you know where Nobby got
this car?

626
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:25,733
I thought it more tactful
not to inquire.

627
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:29,100
Oh, I nearly forgot.

628
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,633
Hold this, will you?

629
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:38,200
Thank you.

630
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:43,833
- Well, here we are.
- Now hold your hat on.

- BOTH: Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

632

- I wish to see
Oberst Wiessner.
- Your papers, please?

633
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:10,633
- Champagne, try a bottle.
- Yes.

634
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,267
- It's French, you'll like it.
- You wish to see
Herr Oberst Wiessner?

635
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:15,533
- Please.
- Come with me, please.

636
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,300
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil!

637
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:31,967
To see Herr Oberst Wiessner.

638
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:35,633
Will you sign your names,
please?

639
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:43,833
In order.

640
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,367
Come with me, please.

641
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:55,567
- Nice lot of stuff
they've got here.
- Yeah.

642
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:58,367
- Look. Our old friend
the music box.
- What?

643
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:05,300

645
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,300
Sit down, gentlemen.

646
00:41:12,633 --> 00:41:15,600
We do not receive
many visitors here.

647
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:18,800
- You must forgive me.
- They are from
our foreign office.

648
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:20,333
Yes, yes, so I see.

649
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,633
But still it doesn't explain
what you are doing
in a military area

650
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,400
Without a proper
military escort.

651
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:29,467
- Is that necessary?
- Of course it's necessary!

652
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:33,067
I don't understand
how you got through
our controls without one.

653
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,167
In Berlin, they said
this would be sufficient.

654
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,800
This is a military area.

655
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:43,067
I have not the authority to
let civilians roam about
in it at will.

656
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,700
If you haven't the authority,
perhaps you'll send us to
someone who has.

657
00:41:46,767 --> 00:41:48,500
That's for me to decide!

658
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:51,100
I think you better have
another look at that
signature.

659
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:57,533
- Ribbentrop?
- Von Ribbentrop.

660
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,400
- Please, gentlemen,
I did not mean...
- Oh, that's all right.

661
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:06,400
Hello, give me Major Lang.
Intelligence Office.

662
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:08,867
Major Lang. Yes?

663
00:42:09,733 --> 00:42:11,333
Whom do you say?

664
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,500
Two friends of
Herr von Ribbentrop to see
Oberst Wiessner?

665
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,933
- Yes, I will see them.
- Thank you.

666
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:21,933
(BOTH SPEAKING GERMAN)

667
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:25,067
Take these two gentlemen
to Major Lang.

668
00:42:25,067 --> 00:42:27,100
I am at your service,
gentlemen.

669
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:40,800
I'm beginning to like it
around here.

Good morning, gentlemen.

Major Lang.

675
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:11,800
This is Hauptmann Grune.

676
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:14,967
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

677
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:22,367
- Well, what can we do for you?
- Herr Major,

678
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:25,300
I have a message for
Oberst Wiessner from
Herr von Ribbentrop.

679
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:27,833
I'm afraid Oberst Wiessner
is on leave.

680
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,467
I'm his deputy.

681
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:31,700
Is there anything I can do
to help you?

682
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:34,567
Can I speak confidentially?

683
00:43:34,633 --> 00:43:36,867
Oh, yes, certainly.

684
00:43:36,933 --> 00:43:40,133
My partner and I happen to be
in the same business
as Herr von Ribbentrop.

685
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,300
Oh, I see. You mean, you are
members of the foreign office?

686
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:45,833
No, no, no, I mean his real
business, champagne merchant.

687
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,933
Oh, champagne.

688
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:50,133
I see.

689
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,133
And strictly
between ourselves,

690
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,300
He has an interest
in our business.

691
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,100
Purely fatherly interest,
of course.

692
00:43:58,167 --> 00:43:59,833
Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course.

693
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,867
And so, at his suggestion,
we are trying to make
arrangements to supply

694
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:05,767
The officers
of the German Army
with our champagne.

695
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:08,633
Most of it was confiscated
when France was occupied.

696

which Goering didn't drink.

We are most anxious to help
you, but our mess secretary
will tell you that

700
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:26,833
Just at the present,
our mess funds are rather low.

701

- Well, so are our prices.
- (LAUGHING)

702
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,967
Would you care to try
a bottle?

703
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:34,867
Well, I won't say no.

704
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:37,367
And I don't suppose you will,
Grune.

705

Thank you.

706
00:44:41,633 --> 00:44:44,067
I'll put it on ice and
fetch some glasses.

- Smart fellow, that.
- He's a regular soldier.

- Aren't you?
- No, I am only a reservist.

I am here because of
my language qualifications.

I am an authority on America.

The way the Reich is going,
I may be there at any moment.

712
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:06,867
When does Oberst Wiessner
return?

but I think...

Excuse me.

Yes?

Yes, Excellency.

No, he's away.

00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:21,067
Major Lang has gone out of
the room for a moment.

719
00:45:21,067 --> 00:45:23,267
Yes, Excellency. At once.

720
00:45:34,867 --> 00:45:37,467
That was the General,
he wants to see me at once.

721

He's in a very bad temper.

Excuse me just a moment,
please.

PETER: By the way,
who is the General?

724
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:45,633
Von Reichman, of course.

725
00:45:47,567 --> 00:45:49,167
Von Reichman.

726
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:50,667
- Watch the door.
- What's the idea?

727
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:52,133
Don't argue. Watch the door.

Oh, here's Grune now.

731
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,667
Well, what was your
impression?

732
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:38,433
- Of what?
- Of the two men, of course.

733
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,067
- I don't know...
- Do you think they're genuine
champagne merchants?

734
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:45,800
I did.

735
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:49,067
From what you tell me,
it's quite obvious
they are not.

736
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,133
- Anyway, the champagne
looks too good.
- And the talks are wrong.

737
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,500
- Yes.
- Well, then who are they?

738
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:56,967
Either Gestapo or
a counter-espionage.

739
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:59,667
Nosing around for something,
obviously.

Well, they won't get anything
out of us.

They better not.

Quite a few generals have been
purged lately, haven't they?

- Anyway, you better
get back quick.
- Yes, Excellency.

- And remember,
keep your mouth shut.
- Yes, Excellency.

waiting.

Not at all, we've been
admiring your view.

It is a beautiful house.

755
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,433
I have some Persian
miniatures I am sending home
to my wife.

00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,367
Really?

757
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:01,433
I'm interested in
miniatures, too.

758
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,533
- Really? Would you like to
look at them?
- Yes. Yes, I would.

759
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,100
- That cigarette you
gave him...
- What about it?

760
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:12,333
- It's English.
- Blimey.

761
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,200
Look.

762
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:19,967
- They're beautiful,
aren't they?
- Remarkable.

English?

764
00:48:27,733 --> 00:48:28,833
Yes.

765
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:32,067
Well, where do you
get them from?

766
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:34,433
Herr von Ribbentrop never
smokes anything else.

767
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:36,767
Have a packet.

768
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:39,267
Thank you very much.

769
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,767
Gentlemen,
Herr General von Reichman
has expressed

770
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:46,100
A desire to meet you.

771
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:47,667
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil.

772
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:50,700
Well, gentlemen,
let's see your champagne.

773
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,067
Sit down, please.

774
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:01,500
Now, to your business.

775
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:04,267
(CORK POPS)

776
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:08,733
(INAUDIBLE)

777
00:49:18,967 --> 00:49:21,267
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

778
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,867
- What was all that in aide of?
- Oh, the poor boy.

779
00:49:23,933 --> 00:49:25,700
Poor boy,
what was he crying about?

780
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:27,800
Well, how would you like to be
going to Russia?

781
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:30,400
- I wouldn't,
not if I was a German.
- Well, there you are.

782
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,833
He is being transferred,
and he likes it here.

783
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,667
He says that he feels safe
because the aerodrome where
he works is underground

784
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:38,667
And safe from British bombers.

785
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:42,633
He didn't say the whereabouts
of this drome, did he?

786
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,333
No, just cried and cried
and cried.

787
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,067
Go on,
you're breaking my heart.

788
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,367
Nobby, don't you pull my legs.

789
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:52,133
You're quite safe, my dear.

790
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:56,600
PETER: There you are.

791
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:58,367
Thank you.

792
00:49:58,433 --> 00:50:00,967
It is very good.
Very, very good.

793
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:02,967
We can take all you can
give us.

794
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,800
I'm afraid we can only let you
have your fair share,
you know.

795
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,600
How many offices have you got
in your mess?

796
00:50:07,667 --> 00:50:10,733
- Thirty-five.
- Thirty-five, make a note
of that, would you?

797
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,467
- That means we can let you
have 12 dozen to start.
- Excellent.

798
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:15,300
Oh, and I forgot to tell you,

799
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:17,733
We've got some very good
Danish beer, which the men
rather like.

800
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,667
Excellent, we will buy that,
too.

801
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:21,500
How many men have you got
in this area?

802
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,100
Oh, about 3,000.

803
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:29,800
- 3,000.
- But they are only reservists.

804
00:50:29,867 --> 00:50:33,000
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- (HICCUPS)

805
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:36,300
-(LAUGHS)
Let's make it a party.
- Yes!

806
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:40,033
Life is not so bad, huh?
(LAUGHING)

807
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,400
Oh, thank you very much.

808
00:50:42,467 --> 00:50:45,433
Newspapers are reporting
a lot of landings
on this part of the coast.

809
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,800
Oh, you mustn't believe
everything you read in
the Berlin newspapers.

810
00:50:48,867 --> 00:50:51,967
The villagers say there
have been no British landings
here at all, is that true?

811
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:53,267
That's nonsense!

812
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,600
Only two days ago
we captured a British.

813
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:57,667
- He's in hospital now,
we're waiting on...
- VON REICHMAN: Grune!

814
00:50:57,733 --> 00:51:00,600
-(HICCUPS)
- There's an absolute military
ban on the subject!

815
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:02,400
Yes, yes, of course.

816
00:51:02,467 --> 00:51:06,200
But I can tell you this,
if it wasn't for my
determination and willpower,

817
00:51:06,267 --> 00:51:09,867
The population would soon
get out of hand, they're
always trying sabotage.

818
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:13,300
Only I make them pay for it,
you can be sure!

819
00:51:13,367 --> 00:51:15,500
- (CHUCKLES)
- Yes, I'm pretty sure of that.

820
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:17,133
Well, I'm afraid
we must be going.

821
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,900
Would you like
a military escort?

822
00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:23,233
- No, I don't think so,
thank you.
- Quite sure?

823
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,800
Quite sure, thank you.

824
00:51:24,867 --> 00:51:26,867
You won't forget to send
the champagne?

825
00:51:26,933 --> 00:51:28,600
No, Excellency,
you shall have it next week.

826
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:31,267
- Goodbye, many thanks.
- Thanks to you.

827
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,900
We shall have much pleasure
in telling Herr von Ribbentrop
about our visit.

828
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:36,133
- Good, give him my regards.
- I will indeed.

829
00:51:38,467 --> 00:51:39,567
Thank you.

830
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,900
BOTH: Heil Hitler!

BOTH: Heil Hitler.

832
00:51:48,067 --> 00:51:50,300
They didn't fool me
for a minute.

833
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:52,967
Well, they certainly didn't
get anything out of us.

834
00:51:53,067 --> 00:51:56,867
All the same, you had better
report the visit to Gerhard
von Stumpfner in Paris.

835
00:51:56,933 --> 00:51:59,433
- Tell him I'm rather annoyed.
- Very well, Excellency.

836
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,900
(EXHALES)

837
00:52:01,967 --> 00:52:04,167
I wouldn't go through that
again for all the tea
in China.

838
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:05,233
Nor I.

839
00:52:07,067 --> 00:52:09,700
Do you think
we overdid the heils?

840
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:12,633
No. I think they rather
enjoyed them.

841
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,500
- I wish you could do something
about Mackenzie.
- So do I.

842
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:17,133
We would if we possibly can.

843
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,800
He must have information HQ
would give their ears for.

844
00:52:20,867 --> 00:52:23,133
I hope those photos
come out all right.

845
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,467
If they do, won't
our little flying angels
have a good time?

846
00:52:26,533 --> 00:52:28,500
We've certainly had
a lot of luck.

847
00:52:29,867 --> 00:52:32,067
Especially the cigarettes.

848
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,800
I'm giving up smoking.

849

(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

850
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:46,900
- That's the stuff to give 'em.
- Rather good to see
those boys up there.

851
00:52:46,967 --> 00:52:49,633
- What about the boys
down here?
-(LAUGHING)

852
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:01,933
Isn't there anything I can do?

853
00:53:02,067 --> 00:53:04,133
Yes, if you stay with us,
there is plenty you can do...

854
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,267
Now, Michele, why can you
not understand?

855

(WHISTLING)

856
00:53:14,967 --> 00:53:17,067
- What is that?
- One of my friends.

857
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,433
- Why do you allow them to
come here? It is madness!
- I shan't be long.

858
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,433
Oh, there you are, sir.

859
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,633
- All present and correct, sir.
- Any information?

860
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,833
- My missus got a bit from
the duty gunner, sir.
- Oh? What did he have to say?

861
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,500
- He was crying, sir.
- Crying?

862
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:39,567
Yes, crying like a baby,
he was.

863
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,233
They wanted to send him off
to Russia, but he didn't want
to go.

864
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,233
He preferred to stop here
because, as he told my missus,

865
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,167
-They've got underground
fortifications here.
- Oh? Where?

866
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:49,933
That I don't know, sir.

867
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:51,667
But they're all controlled
from one spot,
also underground.

868
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:54,500
- But you don't know
where they're situated?
- No, sir.

869

(DOOR CLOSING)

00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:05,067
Raoul, please, please
stay indoors.

871
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:08,533
- You have no idea
how frightened I am.
- I have work to do, Michele.

872
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,833
And your friend? Where is he?

873
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,733
- I thought he was coming back.
- He will come back.

874
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,267
You'll see.

875
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:22,833
They're all right.

876
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,900
- When it's enlarged, will the
conventional signs come up?
- Yes, should do.

877
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:28,667
Look, there's
that coastal battery.

878
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,633
And there's
the Panzer formation.

879
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,867
Anyway, we've got some decent
targets for the bomber boys.

880
00:54:35,933 --> 00:54:38,700
Now if only we could
find out more about
that underground control room.

881
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:40,633
Then we'd have the whole thing
in the bag.

882
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,600
You used not to worry like
this for Monsieur Raoul.

883
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,067
- What's the matter now?
- My hands. They're terrible!

884
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:11,067
Don't you worry.
He won't be looking
at your hands tonight.

885
00:55:13,467 --> 00:55:15,667
Violette, you're a very silly
old woman.

886
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,233
Now run along.

887
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,167
Dinner's nearly ready.

888
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,067
You look as though
you've just stepped out
of one of these frames.

889
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,833
Monsieur Garnett,
I did not see you.

890
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,067
- What a lovely dress.
- Do you like it?

891
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:41,433
Yes, I do.

892
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:44,533
Makes you look...

893
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,167
I don't know,
it makes you look...

894
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:49,533
- You know what I mean?
- Not quite.

895
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,533
Well, it does.

896
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,333
Yet there's something missing.
I can't think what it is.

897
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,333
- Lipstick?
- No, it's not that.

898
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,200
Powder, then?
My nose is shiny.

899
00:55:57,267 --> 00:55:58,700
No.

900
00:55:58,767 --> 00:56:00,767
I know, a flower.

901
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,600
Let's go in the garden
and get one, shall we?

902
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:07,267
- Is it safe for you?
- Yes.

903
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,800
You know, I should like that
moon, but I don't, I hate it.

904
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:26,833
- What's wrong with it?
- Well, we ought to
get cracking soon.

905
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,933
- All I want is dark,
dark clouds.
- I see.

906
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,300
You may not believe it,
but this was once
quite a show garden.

907
00:56:35,367 --> 00:56:38,500
How awful for you to watch it
gradually disintegrating.

908
00:56:38,567 --> 00:56:42,467
- Is that the right word?
- Shall I give you some English
lessons, Monsieur Garnett?

909
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,800
I wish you would.
Then I could help you
with your French.

910
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:46,567
(LAUGHS)

911
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:49,100
- That's the first time
I've seen you laugh.
- You laugh a lot in England?

912

- This is awful.

1216
01:19:58,933 --> 01:20:01,867
- They were both here
a short time ago, but...
- Where are they now?

1217
01:20:01,933 --> 01:20:04,600
I'm not sure.
But I must find them!

1218
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:06,133
Thank you, mademoiselle.

1219
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:37,133
These trees look
all alike to me, we must
be getting somewhere.

1220
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,600
Shh! There's somebody coming!

1221
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,433
- It's Michele!
- Peter!

1222
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,500
Thank heavens I found you.

1223
01:20:44,567 --> 01:20:46,933
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to show you
the tree.

1224
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,433
- Is this some kind of trap?
- Oh, no! No, no!

1225
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:51,900
What are you doing here?

1226
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,800
Fayolle came to see me.
He told me everything.

1227
01:20:55,867 --> 01:20:59,300
I feel so ashamed,
I was thinking only for
myself.

1228
01:20:59,367 --> 01:21:01,133
Oh, Peter.

1229
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,400
Can you ever forgive me?

1230
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:08,967
Forgive you? Oh, my darling.

1231
01:21:09,067 --> 01:21:11,867
- Where do we go from here?
- I'll show you.
It's quite near.

1232
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:14,933
Only we must go very quietly.
The Germans patrols are out.

1233
01:21:15,067 --> 01:21:17,567
Put up your hands!

1234
01:21:17,633 --> 01:21:19,967
So, the champagne merchants.

1235
01:21:20,067 --> 01:21:22,333
Our general
will be very pleased.

1236
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,067
And the lady.

1237
01:21:25,333 --> 01:21:27,400
Nice trap, my lady.

1238
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:30,067
I did not do it on purpose!

1239
01:21:30,133 --> 01:21:32,533
You believe that,
don't you, Peter?

1240
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:37,100
What you tried to do was
splendid. We always knew
it might end like this.

1241
01:21:37,167 --> 01:21:40,333
- Maybe Raoul was lucky.
- Do not talk. Follow me.

1242
01:21:42,067 --> 01:21:44,100
- There is the tree.
- There's the tree.

1243
01:21:44,167 --> 01:21:45,733
RED: Oh, bless its heart.

1244
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,467
*

1245
01:21:49,533 --> 01:21:52,100
What the devil?
Did you get his name, sir?

1246
01:21:52,167 --> 01:21:54,933
I can take care of them,
I just can't switch off
this blasted music.

1247
01:21:55,067 --> 01:21:57,867
Come on over, you two.
Come on over before I do you!

1248
01:21:57,933 --> 01:22:00,400
Nice night, miss.
Come on, keep them hands up.

1249
01:22:00,467 --> 01:22:01,800
Nobby's the name, miss.

1250
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,200
Excuse me, sir. With the
compliments of the missus.

1251
01:22:07,267 --> 01:22:08,667
I think this ought to
do the lady good.

1252
01:22:08,733 --> 01:22:10,300
Now tell us how you got hold
of the music box.

1253
01:22:10,367 --> 01:22:12,067
Well, sir, I've been feeling
very angry

1254
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:14,100
Ever since I heard what they
done to Captain de Carnot.

1255
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:16,233
And a short while back,
I come across the crew

1256
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:19,067
Standing peacefully
by the side of the road,
reading a map. It was easy.

1257
01:22:19,133 --> 01:22:21,633
- Easy?
-(IMITATING MACHINE GUN)
You know, sir.

1258
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:23,067
With their own gun, too!

1259
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,267
What's the time?

1260
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:27,867
2:15.

1261
01:22:27,933 --> 01:22:29,567
That gives us just over
an hour before
our bomber boys come in.

1262
01:22:29,633 --> 01:22:30,833
If they come.

1263
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,267
Course they'll come.
Hey, wait a minute,

1264
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:34,200
This fellow's about my size.
Give me a hand with him,
will you?

1265
01:22:34,267 --> 01:22:35,800
All right, sir,
what's the idea?

1266
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:43,400
What are you going to do now?

1267
01:22:43,467 --> 01:22:45,533
Something useful, I hope.

1268
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,700
- You are not going to
risk your life again.
- Of course not, Michele.

1269
01:22:48,767 --> 01:22:51,500
- You ready, Nobby?
- I'm on me way, sir.

1270
01:22:51,567 --> 01:22:53,133
All present and correct, sir.

1271
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,067
What's the time now?

1272
01:22:55,067 --> 01:22:56,733
-2:23.
- I'll be back
as soon as I can.

1273
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,700
If I'm not back in an hour,
carry on.

1274
01:22:58,767 --> 01:23:00,600
- You've got the photographs
and things?
- Yes, sir.

1275
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:02,833
Michele will show you
the exact spot
where to guide them in.

1276
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,733
When you've done that,
slip over to the other map
reference.

1277
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,833
Right.

1278
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:08,467
Be careful, Peter. Please.

1279
01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:09,933
Please, for me.

1280
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:16,867
- Any music, sir?
- Yes, as loud as you'd like.

1281
01:23:16,933 --> 01:23:19,067
"Bridal Chorus" is just
what I want tonight.

1282
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,100
*

1283
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:29,667
- What are they going to do?
- I don't know.

1284
01:23:29,733 --> 01:23:31,400
But I can give
a jolly good guess.

1285
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,067
Come on, you lot, get up!

1286
01:23:35,667 --> 01:23:36,967
*

1287
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,567
Excuse me, sir.

1288
01:23:46,633 --> 01:23:49,167
- Isn't this the way to the
German headquarters?
- Mmm-hmm.

1289
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,267
As near as
makes no difference.

1290
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:53,100
Yes, I thought it might be.

1291
01:24:09,767 --> 01:24:11,900
- Casualty?
- No, I want to see
the officer in charge.

1292
01:24:11,967 --> 01:24:14,367
- He's asleep, Sergeant.
- Well, I must see somebody.

1293
01:24:14,433 --> 01:24:16,633
- There's a duty officer.
- Well, take me to him.

1294
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:18,167
Please come with me.

1295
01:24:21,867 --> 01:24:24,233
- What do you want?
- Message from headquarters,
Herr Oberleutnant.

1296
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:35,100
What does this mean?

1297
01:24:35,167 --> 01:24:37,933
The General wants the prisoner
you have sent to him
immediately.

1298
01:24:38,067 --> 01:24:39,433
Hasn't he been punished
enough?

1299
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,733
Those are my orders from
Oberst Wiessner.

1300
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,733
Well, it's most irregular.

1301
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:47,733
- Why didn't Oberst Wiessner
telephone?
- The wires are cut.

1302
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:49,467
- What, again?
- Yes, Herr Oberleutnant.

1303
01:24:49,533 --> 01:24:51,667
Oberst Wiessner said
he'd return the prisoner
in the morning

1304
01:24:52,967 --> 01:24:55,267
If he's still alive.

1305
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:58,167
Do you happen to know
why they want this man
in such a hurry?

1306
01:24:58,233 --> 01:25:00,433
The two men waiting for the
British have been captured.

1307
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,600
The General wants to face them
with the prisoner while
their nerves are still bad.

1308
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:06,433
Wait for me here.

1309
01:25:13,767 --> 01:25:16,067
Dash, dot, dot, dot, dash,

1310
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:18,500
Dot, dash, dot.
You go on like that. Got it?

1311
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:20,067
Dash, dot, dot...

1312
01:25:27,433 --> 01:25:29,733
Well, Sergeant,
here is your man.

1313
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:31,233
Will you sign for him?

1314
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:35,933
This is very irregular.

1315
01:25:36,067 --> 01:25:38,767
- Please see he is brought back
here as soon as possible.
- Yes, Herr Oberleutnant.

1316
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:40,600
The orderly will help you
with this man.

1317
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,633
Hurry.

1318
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:59,233
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine. Now.

1319
01:26:03,733 --> 01:26:07,067
Not bad, eh?
Transport provided by
the German Army.

1320
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,067
- Ride 'em, cowboy!
- That's right. (LAUGHING)

1321
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,600
(PHONE RINGING)

1322
01:26:15,267 --> 01:26:17,233
Yes? (SPEAKING GERMAN)

1323
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,067
Ward three?

1324
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,600
I'm coming at once.

1325
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:31,867
Give me co-headquarters!

1326
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,900
Korr? Put me through to
Oberst Wiessner.

1327
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:38,567
What's that?

1328
01:26:38,633 --> 01:26:40,067
He is not back yet.

1329
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,767
Well, someone in his office.

1330
01:26:42,367 --> 01:26:43,967
Hmm?

1331
01:26:44,067 --> 01:26:46,200
They're all in bed
except the duty officer.

1332
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,233
Wait!

1333
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:52,133
Tell me, have the wires been
cut tonight?

1334
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,533
They haven't?

1335
01:26:57,067 --> 01:26:58,300
Give me the guard room!

1336
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:05,933
3:10.

1337
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,733
First light coming up.

1338
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,233
I wish he would come back.

1339
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:11,933
Yes, I'd be pleased to
see him.

1340
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:22,567
Came the dawn.

1341
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:25,967
We'll leave the car here.
If we take it any further,

1342
01:27:26,067 --> 01:27:27,733
We lead Jerry straight to
our rendezvous.

1343
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,167
- Think you manage
a few hundred yards?
- Eh, I can manage ten miles.

1344
01:27:30,233 --> 01:27:31,633
- Lend me a hand, Nobby.
- I'll tell you what, sir.

1345
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:33,800
I'll drive the car on a bit,
and leave it peacefully
in a ditch.

1346
01:27:33,867 --> 01:27:35,500
That'll draw the chase away
from you.

1347
01:27:35,567 --> 01:27:37,933
- What makes you think
they're going to chase us?
- They're chasing you now, sir.

1348
01:27:38,067 --> 01:27:39,933
-(VEHICLES APPROACHING)
- How do you get back to
the beach?

1349
01:27:40,067 --> 01:27:42,633
Oh, I know the country like
the back of me hand, sir.
I'll meet you down the beach.

1350
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,433
- If you can get away with it.
- I'll get away with it, sir.

1351
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:45,767
Goodbye, good luck.
See you later.

1352
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,233
I can't see any signal.

1353
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,633
There it is, sir!

1354
01:28:21,967 --> 01:28:23,533
(ALL SHOUTING)

1355
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,067
See you down there, chaps.

1356
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,500
Here they come!

1357
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,667
Our job's over.

1358
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:17,667
- Is everything all right?
- I've got some Jerries for you
over there.

1359
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:20,367
That's fine, I'll take care
of them. Sergeant, you know
what to do with them.

1360
01:29:20,433 --> 01:29:22,233
Yes, sir. Come on,
press on, men.

1361
01:29:25,567 --> 01:29:28,367
- Right, well, I'll hand over.
- Right.

1362
01:29:28,433 --> 01:29:30,067
Come along, we must go
down to the beach.

1363
01:29:30,133 --> 01:29:32,233
- We've got to get there
before they come back.
- But Peter...

1364
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,067
We'll see him on the beach,
come on.

1365
01:30:01,267 --> 01:30:03,000
(GUNFIRE)

1366
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,000
The English are here!

1367
01:30:32,833 --> 01:30:34,633
Come on, get ready!
To the boats!

1368
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,133
Retreat to the boats!

1369
01:30:50,567 --> 01:30:53,200
- That's music to my ears.
- NOBBY: Sir?

1370
01:30:53,267 --> 01:30:55,733
- Sir, all present
and correct, sir.
- Where's Major Garnett?

1371
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,067
I had to leave him behind,
sir.

1372
01:30:57,133 --> 01:30:58,600
Something's happened to him.

1373
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:00,533
- I feel it.
- Take it easy.

1374
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,267
Don't worry, miss.
He'll be along in a minute.

1375
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:05,133
- Here, put that on,
you look like a German.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

1376
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:08,133
- Only a few more yards.
- Yeah, I'm enjoying
the stroll.

1377
01:31:08,767 --> 01:31:09,933
Peter!

1378
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:14,433
Thank heavens you're safe!

1379
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,900
- Everything all right?
- Now you're here,
everything's fine.

1380
01:31:16,967 --> 01:31:18,633
- This is Mackenzie.
- How do you do?
-Hello!

1381
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:20,300
The boys are certainly doing
a good job, aren't they?

1382
01:31:20,367 --> 01:31:22,067
Yeah, and tonight's raid
won't be the last.

1383
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,067
We'll go on hitting them
again and again,
then some more.

1384
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,267
We'll show those Huns.
We'll give 'em war.

1385
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:28,700
Excuse me, sir,
you better come with me.

1386
01:31:28,767 --> 01:31:31,300
The boat's not far away,
just a hop, skip and a jump.

1387
01:31:31,367 --> 01:31:34,433
- I beg your pardon.
-(LAUGHING)
That's all right with me.

1388
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,067
The call signal's
just gone up.

1389
01:31:38,633 --> 01:31:40,733
We'll make them pay
for Raoul, Michele.

1390
01:31:46,433 --> 01:31:49,367
- We'd better hurry.
- I'm not coming with you.

1391
01:31:49,433 --> 01:31:50,700
I'm staying here.

1392
01:31:51,633 --> 01:31:53,067
Are you crazy?

1393
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:56,067
Peter, if you and Raoul can
do all that you have done,

1394
01:31:56,133 --> 01:31:58,100
I can do a little, too.

1395
01:31:58,167 --> 01:32:00,067
Rene needs me,
so does Violette,

1396
01:32:00,133 --> 01:32:02,967
And tomorrow there will be
German soldiers billeted
at the chateau.

1397
01:32:03,067 --> 01:32:04,467
I can be very useful.

1398
01:32:05,767 --> 01:32:07,400
Michele, my darling.

1399
01:32:07,467 --> 01:32:08,833
RED: Come on, you two!

1400
01:32:12,533 --> 01:32:13,933
Go along, Peter.

1401
01:32:22,067 --> 01:32:24,600
This will bring you safety.

1402
01:32:26,067 --> 01:32:27,567
SOLDIER: Come on, boys!

1403
01:32:37,667 --> 01:32:39,067
Goodbye, Michele.

1404
01:32:41,433 --> 01:32:42,767
Au revoir.

1405
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,733
Peter.

1406
01:33:17,533 --> 01:33:19,467
