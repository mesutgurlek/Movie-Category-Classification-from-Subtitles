ADONIJAH: Solomon!
What are you doing here?

14
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,633
On our way to Jerusalem, we got word

15
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,385
that the Egyptians
were on the prowl again.

16

20

Our father, David, was a singer of songs,
but he's also a mighty warrior.

Where are the Egyptians?

22
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,488
They thought to trap me,

23

Your mother and I

We must have hope.

161
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,549
My prayers have been answered.

162
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:10,679
That you are here while your father
is able to give you his blessing.

- Mother.
-My son.

My son.

00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,728
Do not despair.

166
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,912
Is there hope?

167
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,123
His heart still beats.

168
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:42,419
But his breath is so quenched
that it leaves no mist upon the metal.

00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,842
My father, my king.

Let my prayers
call you back from the shadows.

The peace of the Lord.

174
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:10,822
In my dream,
your face was ever before me.

175
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,366
Now I am here, Father.

176
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,870
And where is your brother?

177
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,539
Adonijah was detained with his troops.

178

Ever the soldier before all else.

179
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:28,089
Send messengers
with my command that he return.

180
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,008
It will be done.

181
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,012
Now rest until your strength returns.

182
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,223
Bring me Nathan the Prophet.

183
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,601
I am here, 0 King.

184

Summon the elders of the 12 tribes
and the council.

I have had a vision from God.

(BANGS STAFF)

187
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,691
You have been summoned,
at the King's command.

188
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,443
Hear the words of the King.

189
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,656
Has there been no report from
the couriers sent to bring Adonijah?

190
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,033
No, Sire. None have returned.

191
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,370
Then I must act without him.

192
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,042
Forty years I have reigned over you.

193
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:50,130
And I have been your father,
and you, my beloved children.

Excepting the memory of me,
which will live in your hearts,

195
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,887
I leave but one monument to my name,

196
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:03,726
the unity of Israel, symbol of the 12 tribes.

197
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:07,397
Once separate,
each striving for dominance.

198
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:11,109
But now you, the elders of the tribes,
stand before me,

in an indestructible oneness.

200
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:20,493
You were the last
to lead your tribe into the union, Ahab.

201
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,288
And as a pledge of your loyalty,

202
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:27,917
you brought me your only child, Abishag.

203
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,548
I have loved and cherished her
as my own daughter,

204
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,426
as I have loved and cherished Israel,

205
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:40,054
of which she has become
the living symbol.

206

She has been an honor to my house.

DAVID: And to the household of David.

208
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:52,609
And my day is almost done.

But the day of Israel has hardly dawned.

to follow after me on this throne.

Sire, I have driven like a fury
to attend this council.

215
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,048
Ever since your command reached me.

216
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,138
Behold the two halves of me,

217
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,600
the soldier and the poet.

218
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,271
I have loved you both dearly.

219
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:36,736
Tell me,
is there any jealousy between you?

220
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,279
No, Sire.

221
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,989
Jealousy of what?

222
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:43,409
Have I a desire
to distinguish myself as a scholar?

223
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:47,789
It is Adonijah's destiny to rule,
and I will truly serve him.

224
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:52,502
It's God who decrees
the destinies of his creatures, my son.

225
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:56,256
As I lay close to death,
out of the darkness,

226
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,175
a great voice called to me and said,

227
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:04,389
"I am the Lord thy God
who placed thee upon the throne.

228
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,433
"And this I declare unto you.

229
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:13,106
"Only in peace can Israel prosper
and be made great.

230
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,441
"Not in strife."

231
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:21,614
And again, the Lord God Jehovah
spoke to his servant, David.

232
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:27,078
"Behold a son has been born unto thee,
a man of peace,

233
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:31,207
"wherefore thou hast
named him Solomon.

234
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,587
"And I will establish his kingdom forever."

235
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,551
- The kingdom is mine.
-God wills it otherwise.

236
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,762
You made good use
of your time alone with him.

237
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:46,889
You used his weakness
to poison his mind against me.

238
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,099
- I knew nothing of this.
-You lie!

239
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,560
- Adonijah.
-You were always a weaver of words.

240
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,562
You accuse your brother falsely.

241
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,356
After you've chosen him over me?
Theirs should be the choice.

242
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,567
They are Israel. Let them choose.

243
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,694
JOAB: Aye, hear us! Adonijah!

244
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,112
ALL: Adonijah!

245
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,905
And you, the elders, what say you?

246
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,907
Accept the will of God, Adonijah.

247
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,243
The crown is mine and I shall fight for it.

248
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,745
JOAB: Adonijah's the rightful heir.

249
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,456
Act not with violence
lest the wrath of God fall upon you.

250
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,168
Adonijah, believe me, I have never done
anything to deprive you of this crown.

251
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,587
Words from the mouth of a hypocrite.

252
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,505
Isn't yours the act of a hypocrite,
Highness,

253
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,549
in coming here to greet your father?

254
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:22,967
You who proclaimed yourself king

255
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,095
even though you knew
that David still lived?

256
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,265
Has Hezrai spoken truly?

257
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,602
I did not know
that you had sent him to spy on me.

258
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,188
Could you not wait
until the breath had left my body?

259
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,731
I am weary with waiting.

260
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:40,234
Above all others,
the king must respect and obey the law.

261
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:44,530
In proclaiming yourself,
you violated the law of God and man.

262
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:49,744
I claimed what was mine by right
and I shall never relinquish that right.

263
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:53,289
How long will it take them
to discover the incompetence of Solomon?

264
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:55,875
Solomon, king? Impossible.

265
00:22:55,958 --> 00:23:00,630
No, it is revealed out of the mouth
of Adonijah himself

266
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,257
why God has turned his face from him.

267
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,511
The wisdom of God passeth
all understanding.

268
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,681
As it is written, so let it be done.

269
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:15,812
Bring forth the waters of Gihon,
and here, as God commands,

270
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,981
anoint Solomon king of Israel.

271
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,820
NATHAN: By the grace of God.
ALL: By the grace of God.

272
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,740
Yield, Adonijah, yield,
and bend the knee in the name of God.

273
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,952
Never! Rather would I bend knee
to the Egyptian Pharaoh

274
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,080
than to this brother
who has robbed me of my birthright.

275
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:41,003
Then hold high the tablet of unity
before his eyes

276
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:46,134
so that he may ever remember
the purpose of his consecration.

277
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,147
Hail Solomon!

278
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:03,860
By the grace of God, King of Israel!

279
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,154
ALL: Hail Solomon!

280
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:10,241
By the grace of God, King of Israel.

281
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,706
Turn not against thy brother, Solomon.

282
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:21,461
His blood is hot but it will cool.

283
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:25,923
You have my pledge, Sire.
I will never forget that he is my brother.

284
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:33,389
And you, my child, will you remain
in the King's household or...

285
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:37,560
Or will you return to Gilead
with your father, Ahab?

286
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:42,648
When I was brought to the house of David,
my people sang songs of gladness

287
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,151
and I came with joy in my heart.

288
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:49,614
With the same joy, I will remain
within the house of Solomon.

289
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:55,828
One thing remains heavy on my heart.

290
00:24:57,497 --> 00:25:02,877
In my youth, I dreamed
that I would build a mighty temple

291
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,963
to house the Ark of the Covenant.

292
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,424
But I sinned greatly

293
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:12,762
and was not fit
to erect the habitation of the Lord.

294
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:17,266
Redeem my vow, my son.

295
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:22,897
Pledge me that you will build
the great temple of which I had dreamed,

296
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:29,195
so that God will have his dwelling place
among his people.

297
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,781
I promise you it shall be built.

298
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,827
Be strong and of good courage.

299
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:43,751
Dread not nor be dismayed.

300
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:32,717
Oh, Lord, my God,
thou hast made thy servant king

301
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,847
instead of David, my father,
and I am no more than a little child.

302
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:45,104
Give therefore unto thy servant
an understanding heart

303
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:48,190
that I may judge thy people,

304
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:51,569
that I may discern between good and evil.

305
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:57,283
For who is able to judge this
thy so great a people?

306
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:08,044
<i>GOD: Because thou hast asked this thing
and hast not asked for thyself long life,</i>

307
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:12,673
<i>nor riches for thyself,
nor the life of thine enemies,</i>

308
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:16,886
<i>but hast asked for understanding
to discern judgment,</i>

309
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:21,015
<i>behold, I have done
according to thy words.</i>

310
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:26,812
<i>I have given unto thee
a wise and understanding heart,</i>

311
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:29,649
<i>and if thou wilt walk in my ways,</i>

312
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,902

(LAUGHS)

317
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,851
- Not good enough.
-No?

318
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,774
(LAUGHS)

319
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:15,945
With you, I'm seldom good enough.
Double the wager.

320
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,488
Very well.

321
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,118
I should have killed him
when he was chosen king.

322
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,453
Patience, Highness. Wait.

323
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,416
- I'm not a patient man.
- I'm aware of that.

324
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,763
Leave us, Joab.

325
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,809
Did you not hear His Majesty, Joab?
Obey his command.

326
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,648
For a man whose wisdom
is becoming the marvel of the land,

327
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:56,485
you are showing a surprising lack of it
by coming here alone.

328
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,697
I have come to ask a favor of you.

329
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,326
Knowing that this hand of mine mustache
to drive this spear through your body?

330
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,537
I know what is in your heart.

331
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,874
All I ask is that you love your country
as much as you hate me.

332
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,084
(SCOFFS)

333
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:16,380
That would make me the greatest patriot
in the history of Israel.

334
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:20,009
David has laid a great burden upon me,
to rule the kingdom

335
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:23,804
and to build the temple of Jehovah,
both of which I've undertaken.

336
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:27,391
But you have elected to remain here,
in your lodge,

337
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:31,771
depriving the people of your great talent
as a soldier and a commander.

338
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,689
To build is not enough.

339
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:39,320
What has been built must be defended
against all the enemies of the nation.

340
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,323
For that task,
you are far better suited than I.

341
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,867
Return to Jerusalem.

342
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:49,497
Offer your services not to me,
but to your country and your God.

343
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:54,251
You are offering me
command of the army?

344
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,377
Yes.

345
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,005
Even though you know that one day
I might try to use it against you?

346
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,340
Yes.

347
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:06,847
Well?

348
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,853
I am trying to decide
if you are the wisest of the wise

349
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,647
or the fool of fools.

Solomon, King over Israel!

356
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:49,658
Lord God of Israel,
there is no God like thee.

357
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,536
Heaven of heavens cannot contain thee.

358
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,166
How much less this house
that I have builded unto thy name?

359
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:01,045
Yet hear thy servant and his supplication

360
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,547
and let thy word be verified

361
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:06,383
which thou spakest unto my father, David.

362
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,930
And of thy people, Israel,

when they shall pray toward this place,

hear thou in Heaven,
and when thou hearest, forgive.

365

For they be thy people
as this house is thine,

366

that all the earth
may know the Lord is God.

- Oh, Majesty!
-(SHEBA LAUGHING)

372
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:07,319
Come and join us, Baltor.
I am teaching my bird to obey.

373
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:10,572
Takyan disapproves. I need an ally.

374
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:14,493
That is exactly what the Pharaoh
is complaining about, Your Majesty.

375
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:18,706
The Pharaoh is complaining?
We will have to teach him.

376
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,417
Another message
has just arrived from Egypt.

377
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,085
Let it wait.

378
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,712
But it is a serious matter.

379
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:28,507
The Pharaoh has called a conference
of all the kings.

380
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:32,344
Sit down, Baltor. You make Tokki nervous.

381
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,394
A deeper shade, Takyan.

382
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:43,522
Pomegranate. That is the right color.

383
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:49,695
Well, Baltor,
what is the problem this time?

384
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:52,197
Your Majesty,
the problem is the Israelites.

385
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,325
They proclaim peace,
yet continually strengthen their army,

386
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:56,577
and for what purpose?

387
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,455
They are afraid of the Pharaoh perhaps.

388
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,041
What have we to fear?

389
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:08,005
In spite of our eternal hatred,
we now have friendly relations with Israel.

390
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,841
True, but our security is threatened.

391
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:14,470
Almost fanatically
they support their great king, Solomon!

392
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,765
A dreamer. A man of peace.

393
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,558
But a man of ideas.

394
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:23,145
And there is nothing more dangerous
than a man with an idea.

395
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,900
- The threat is real?
-Very real.

396
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:31,195
Solomon's strength is not only his army,
but his God.

397
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:34,490
His God? We have a hundred gods.

398
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:39,870
But this is one god who teaches that
all men are equal and none are slaves.

399
00:34:41,038 --> 00:34:43,082
What a foolish idea.

400
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:51,048
And yet, if that idea
were to take hold of the people,

401
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:56,386
the Queen of Sheba would soon
come crashing down from her throne.

402
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,098
As would all other absolute monarchs.

403
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:03,519
Therefore I strongly advise Your Majesty
to attend this conference.

404
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:08,607
You see, Baltor, to catch the bird,
first bait the trap.

405
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:14,905
Perhaps we can help the Pharaoh
solve the problem of Solomon,

406
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:18,367
and kill two birds with one stone.

407
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:32,214
Since Solomon came
to the throne of Israel,

408
00:35:32,256 --> 00:35:34,550
I've watched his strength grow,

409
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,970
until now his power has become
a threat to my northern borders.

410
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:41,390
And the wealth in trade
which once came to us

411
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,142
now finds its way to him.

412
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,311
For too long we have delayed plans
for his destruction.

413
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,480
Yes, take up arms against him.

414
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:52,109
Raise a great host.
Trample Israel into the dust.

415
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,737
King Eglon, from Moab,
I want 1,000 heavy chariots.

416
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,239
I will send you 2,000.

417
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:01,285
Kaldu, from Chaldea,
you will send me 5,000 archers.

418
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,953
More if they are needed.

419
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,664
We will launch the attack
exactly as I have planned.

420
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:09,459
From the north, the east and the south,
at the same time, by surprise.

421
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:12,754
The Israelites will not know
how or where to make a defense.

422
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,132
We will drive them into the sea.

423
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:19,469
And, Sheba, what force
will you send against Solomon?

424
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,930
None.

425
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,769
Why? Are you not my ally?

426
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,356
We must put an end to Israel, and with it
this dangerous idea of one God.

427
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,567
You talk of war.

428
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:39,156
How can you destroy an idea, a faith,
with the point of your spears?

429
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,578
There is only way it can be done.

430
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,290
What do you suggest? Have you a plan?

431
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:49,666
I have.

432
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:53,962
But for every plan, there is a price.

433
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,882
What do you want this time?

434
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:03,805
The Port of Melish on the Red Sea
in return for the downfall of Solomon.

435
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,642
- It is impossible.
-Melish is my port.

436
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:09,353
This time you ask for too much, Sheba.

437
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:15,025
Tell me, what would be
the cost of a war against Israel?

438
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,819
You know very well.

439
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:21,740
And I offer you a plan almost without cost.

440
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,081
His Majesty hesitates, Baltor.

441
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:34,628
Perhaps we should return to Sheba
rather than to visit Jerusalem.

442
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,921
Wait!

443
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,051
I grant it.

444
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:45,097
And how will you destroy Solomon?

445
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,141
It is said that Solomon is wise.

446
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,812
But no matter how wise a man may be,

447
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:56,149
he is still human with a human weakness.

448
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:02,698
I will sit at the feet of Solomon
like the wise men who flock to Jerusalem

449
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:10,664
and perhaps I will learn from his own lips
the way to destroy him.

450
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:24,511
Truly the way of a woman
is beyond our understanding.

451
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:27,597
The way of a woman is simple, my lord.

452
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:30,976
It is always to follow the way of a man.

453
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,446
I shall keep myself informed
of your progress in Jerusalem.

Greetings.
Her Majesty, the Queen of Sheba.

461
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:11,368
Your Majesty, the King of Israel wishes me
to convey his greetings to you.

462
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:18,458
Truly your king has built nobly.
There is no such splendor even in Egypt.

463
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,300
And all that for a god
they cannot even see.

This is something I never thought to see,

470
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,600
How can a pagan
be converted to the true God

471
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,560
unless she be brought to know him?

472
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:22,272
We must never forget
she is an ally of Egypt.

473
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,357
Because she is an ally of Egypt,

474
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,569
we must show her our unity
and our strength.

475
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:29,571
Let us offer her our friendship in the hope

476
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,365
that we may have one less enemy
confronting us.

She is very beautiful, isn't she?

479
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:13,990
Your Royal Majesty,
permit me to present my sovereign,

480
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:17,369
Her Royal Majesty, the Queen of Sheba.

481
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,718
Israel extends a warm welcome
to Your Majesty.

482
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:38,682
I am grateful for Your Majesty's
permission to visit your beautiful country.

483
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,405
After so much traveling,
you must be pleased

484
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,574
to have at last reached your destination.

485
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,993
If I had traveled 10 times the distance,

486
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:02,080
it would be forgotten
in the face of the marvels I have seen

487
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:06,710
and in the splendor
of your city of Jerusalem.

488
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,505
If it pleases you, we can dispense
with ceremony and let you seek rest.

489
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,757
You are most considerate.

490
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:17,679
But, first, let me offer a token
of my appreciation for the kindness

491
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:21,683
you have shown
to a stranger within your gates.

492
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,186
Baltor!

493
00:43:26,313 --> 00:43:27,647
Haran!

494
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:20,575
- So many gifts.
-Yes, and brought from so far.

495
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,243
Such riches.

496
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:41,513
I have no adequate words to express
my thanks and the gratitude of my people.

497
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:44,557
Along with them, I offer my hand,

498
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:50,271
in the hope that this day will mark
the beginning of a closer friendship

499
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:53,024
between Israel and Sheba.

500
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:55,985
That would be
the most welcome gift of all.

501
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:39,487
Benaiah, do you suppose the land
of the Shebans is always like this?

502
00:45:39,571 --> 00:45:41,489
I would think so, yes.

We must not keep the Queen waiting.

507
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:26,493
- Welcome.
-A message for your queen.

508
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,378
Her Majesty, the Queen.

509
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:44,469
His Majesty, King Solomon, sends
his greetings and has commanded me...

510
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,179
Has commanded us

511
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:50,517
to inform Your Majesty that
in response to Your Majesty's request,

512
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:54,187
he would be most happy
to receive you in private audience.

513
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:56,397
He is most gracious.

514
00:46:56,481 --> 00:47:01,361
How thoughtful of the King
to send so charming an envoy.

515
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:05,573
Oh, he doesn't know I'm here.
I was so anxious to come.

516
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:08,743
Then I am even more pleased. Come in.

517
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:13,414
You are the first
of His Majesty's court to visit me.

518
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:16,543
How interesting your encampment is.

519
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:19,838
Are your people
always so carefree and gay?

520
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,300
We enjoy life and pleasure.

521
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:27,512
- Don't you?
-Oh, yes, we do.

522
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:32,559
But we are an austere people.
We tend to be more serious.

523
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,105
And your king? Is he also serious?

524
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:40,859
King Solomon has a great responsibility.

525
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:43,945
He must maintain the unity
of our 12 tribes.

526
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:49,325
It is very important, this unity?

527
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:52,871
Oh, yes.
Without it, there would be no Israel.

528
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,044
The gods of Sheba.

529
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:03,089
Mal-Ra, the guardian of destiny.

530
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:06,259
Kol, god of the sun and stars.

531
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:08,887
Rama, who sends the rain.

532
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,139
We have many gods.

533
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,308
In Israel, we have one God.

534
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:18,855
When he fails you,
do you blame him for everything?

535
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,149
He never fails us.

536
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,486
You must find it gratifying
to be so close to your king.

537
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:27,989
Are you his sister, perhaps?

538
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,993
Sometimes he calls me that.

539
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,495
We have been very close to each other

540
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:37,957
ever since I came to live
in the house of his father.

541
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,669
Do you stay long in Israel?

542
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,215
That depends upon your king.

543
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:50,386
You are charming, innocent.

544
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:54,807
And you fulfill all my expectations.

545
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:05,610

a gift from its queen.

547
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,247
Almighty what?

548
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:22,627
Twenty men surrounding him
and he calls it a private audience.

549
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:24,879
King Solomon has entertained
Your Majesty royally and he...

550
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,674
Oh, those state banquets.

551
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,051
I at one end, he at the other,

552
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:34,681
and in between us,
a lot of sour-faced old men.

553
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,809
Not once have I been with him alone,
not once.

554
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,395
But, Your Majesty,
we've only been here five days.

555
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:45,358
This Solomon is more difficult to approach
than the Pharaoh of Egypt.

556
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,738
This great king has time for everything
except the time for being a man.

557
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:07,588
Send him to me, Rha-gon, god of love.

558
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,675
Make me the most desirable of women.

559
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,761
Make my lips sweet as honey,

560
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:18,599
my skin soft and fragrant
like the petals of a flower.

561
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,769
Give him to me.

562
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:28,276
I want him at my feet.

Her Majesty and I have met before.

566
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:01,684
My apologies to Your Majesty.

567
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:04,187
I regret that I was unable
to be present at the reception

568
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,980
to welcome you to Jerusalem.

569
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:09,567
Had you been there, it would have
made my welcome even more complete.

570
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,818
Your Majesty is too gracious.

571
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,447
Rather different from the occasion
of your last visit.

572
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:18,618
If I remember rightly,
Your Highness was then a king.

573
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:23,164
Yes. And as a king, I offered you
an alliance against the Pharaoh.

574
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,629
And my answer was not too kind.

575
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,756
So I remember.

576
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,510
This time, I venture to offer you
another alliance.

577
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,554
Do you come as envoy
from the King of Israel?

578
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:42,308
I come as Adonijah,
rightful heir to the throne of Israel.

579
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:46,354
An alliance between us could give us
many of the things we both desire.

580
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:50,441
Do you want Sheban arms
to help you usurp your brother's throne?

581
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,068
Solomon is the usurper.

582
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:55,196
Once I am on the throne,
our two lands could encircle Egypt,

583
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:58,366
and all of the kings would be at our mercy.

584
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,206
Why should I want them at my mercy?

585
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,709
I maintain good relations with the kings.

586
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,879
And King Solomon is my friend.

587
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:14,841
So how could your offer
possibly interest me?

588
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:19,387
Has the screaming eagle
been transformed into a cooing dove?

589

How dull the world would be
if people never changed.

590
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,394
I am wiser, Prince Adonijah.

591
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:29,730
I no longer do battle with the sword.

592
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:32,275
That's why I find your visit here
so disturbing.

593
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:37,238
I find it difficult to believe that you have
come bearing an olive branch of peace.

594
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:42,243
What else could I bring to King Solomon,
who is a man of peace?

595
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:51,752
Your Majesty, it is clear
that I waste your time as well as mine.

With Your Majesty's permission.

as the screaming eagle.

Never before has an alien
sat beside our king in judgment.

00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:30,166
Her presence here profanes all Israel.

Who makes complaint?

603
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:44,555
My Lord King, this woman, Leah,
and I dwell within the same house.

604
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:46,724
I was delivered of a child.

605
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:50,978
On the third day after I was delivered,
she was delivered also.

606
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:54,232
There was no one in the house
but we two.

607
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:59,570
In the night, this woman's child died
because she lay upon it.

608
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:03,491
Wherefore she removed my son
from beside me while I slept

609
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,826
and laid her dead child against my bosom.

610
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:06,869
- She lies!
-I do not lie!

611

SOLOMON: Silence!

612
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:12,458
And when I arose in the morning
to nurse my child, he was dead.

613
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,834
Not so, Lord Solomon.

614
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:15,544
The truth, Lord King.

615
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:20,633
For when I looked at the child in my arms,
I knew it was not the son that I did bear.

616
00:54:20,675 --> 00:54:22,468
It was her own child and none other.

617
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,804
The living child is mine, the dead is yours.

618
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:28,349
The dead is yours, the living, mine.

619
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:30,851
Bring the infant forward.

621
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:38,693
Place the child upon the steps before me
and show him to me.

Draw your sword, Josiah.

624

Divide the child into two parts.

625
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:13,811
Give half to the one woman,
half to the other.

00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:20,026
Oh, no!

627
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:29,785
If it must be, give the child to her
that it may not be slain.

628
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:33,080
Divide it. It should
be neither hers nor mine.

(BABY GURGLING)

630
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:58,814
Take your son, Mother,
for he is surely yours.

631
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:02,943
MOTHER: May the Lord God Jehovah
praise and bless you.

632
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:08,366
You would have rather surrendered him
to another than to see him harmed.

633
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,455
And take this woman hence

634
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:18,125
and administer to her
a punishment to fit her perjury.

635
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:22,046
She lies! She lies!

636
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:25,508
It's not right! The child is mine! Mine!

637
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:31,931
Now at last
I have seen a judgment of Solomon.

638
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,392
And your wisdom amazes me.

639
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:40,689
Whatever wisdom has been given me
was for the benefit of my people.

640
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:43,818
Continue to teach me, I beg of you.

641
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:49,156
So that I may gain a greater insight
into the wonder of your understanding.

642
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:54,286
It will enable me to become a better
and wiser ruler over my own people.

643
00:56:56,247 --> 00:57:01,252
Real wisdom lies in the ability to decide
between the true and the false.

644
00:57:15,558 --> 00:57:19,937
Can you believe that only four years ago,
all this was barren desert?

645
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:24,442
You have such a joy
in all you have accomplished.

646
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:28,446
It is a joy to make the desert bloom
by bringing water from the far mountains.

647
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:31,866
You have made this into a paradise.

648
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:36,203
The water, the work,
the warmth of the sun have done it, not I.

649
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:43,961
In the last few days,
I have shown you much of Israel,

650
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:46,922
but you have not told me
anything of your own country.

651
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:52,344
At this moment, my own land
seems as distant as the stars.

652
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:56,682
In my youth, I used to dream of visiting
all the faraway kingdoms of the earth.

653
00:57:56,724 --> 00:58:00,811
And now instead
the rulers of those countries come to you.

654
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:04,565
You rule Sheba alone?

655
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:09,069
From the beginning of time,
only queens have ruled in Sheba.

656
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,779
That is our law.

657
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:16,660
I would be happy to tell Your Majesty
many things concerning my country,

658
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:19,413
if I were sure
it would be of interest to you.

659
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:21,290
Why do you say that?

660
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:25,294
Because after all the times
I have visited you,

661
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:31,592
you have not returned the compliment
by visiting my encampment and me.

662
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:36,305
Perhaps I was waiting for an invitation.

663
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,475
You promise to accept?

664
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,395
I promise.

I am so happy that at last
you have come to visit me.

My people feel honored.

668
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:11,966
It is your guest who feels honored.

669
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,927
You are not bored
by our primitive pastimes?

670
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:17,972
No, it interests me
to learn what amuses you.

(GONG RINGS)

677

This is the hour of Rha-gon.

678
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,974
Every evening I make an offering to him.

679
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:12,192
Rha-gon, giver of life, god of love,

680
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:16,280
accept this token
of my gratitude and devotion.

681
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:39,553
The feast of Rha-gon is the
most sacred rite celebrated each year

682
01:00:39,595 --> 01:00:41,388
in the land of Sheba.

683
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:47,144
But tonight let there be no talk of gods.

684
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,480
Not even of wisdom.

685
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:53,233
And there is Sheban wine
to warm the heart.

686

My offering to you.

687

Tonight, we are alone in a different world.

My world.

689
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,542
Yes, we are in a different world.

690
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:30,104
Is not the wine to your taste, my lord?

691
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:36,652
It almost made me forget
that you are an ally of the Pharaoh.

692
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,029
An enemy of Israel.

693

everything is prepared for tonight.

-The women of his harem told me.

I don't want to remind him
of other women.

What else have you heard?

They complain
of Solomon's neglect of them.

There is no reason
to be jealous of me as yet.

In spite of the way he left here before,

705
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:41,425
he must have had difficulty
in forgetting you.

Yes, I was.

718

Then why are you sitting here alone?

719
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,288
I felt the need of being alone.

720
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:38,792
What is it that weighs so heavily
upon your heart?

721

Has it come to where
you can read my thoughts?

722
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:47,134
- Haven't I always shared your thoughts?
-Yes.

723
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:53,223
At times, a man feels drawn
toward the dangers that confront him,

724

even at the risk of his own destruction.

Is there something different
about this flame?

I could put it out in one second.

728

Wouldn't that be simpler?

729
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:12,743
Such a little flame, Abishag.

730
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:16,580
And yet unrestrained,
it could destroy all of Jerusalem.

731
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,333
Simpler, yes,

732
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,961
but perhaps without it,
there would be darkness.

Could I rest thinking that perhaps
I had displeased you in some way?

Now you have to be
completely truthful with me.

Why did you come to Jerusalem?

Why do you ask me such a question now?

749
01:08:18,345 --> 01:08:20,931
Because from the first I knew
that behind those lovely eyes

750
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:23,308
is the brain of a very clever woman

who would never have traveled
800 leagues without a purpose.

You have found me out.

01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:41,868
I will confess to you.

754
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:48,041
The Pharaoh is paying me a fabulous price
to spy on you,

to deliver to him all of your secrets.

756
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:55,549
I have considered that,
but Israel has no real secrets from Egypt.

757
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:59,386
Pharaoh is aware
of our weaknesses and our strength.

How could I hope to deceive you?

To bind you to me in soft chains

so that I may do with you as I will.

I do.
So great that I wonder if you will pay it.

the most precious thing in your life.

01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:13,812
(CHUCKUNG)Oh

784
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:18,900
You may speak freely.
I have no secrets from Joab.

785
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:22,779
We have come to take counsel
with Your Highness.

786
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:24,364
About what?

787
01:11:24,447 --> 01:11:27,659
I am the commander of the host,
not a minister of state.

788
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:29,577
It concerns the king.

789
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:35,208
- Then why not consult with him?
-Because he will not listen.

790
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:39,212
Grave criticism is being brought
against him by the people.

791
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:42,882
Who would dare to murmur
against the great Solomon?

792
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:47,554
His association with the Sheban queen
has developed into an open scandal.

793
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:52,017
Worse, he has even brought this
pagan woman to live within the palace,

794
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:56,563
daring to install her in an apartment
adjoining his own private chambers.

795
01:11:57,939 --> 01:12:00,817
Well, that is his affair, not mine.

796
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:05,322
We thought perhaps if you were to
talk to him privately, reason with him.

797
01:12:05,405 --> 01:12:07,574
Point out that his conduct
is a matter of grave concern,

798
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:11,953
not only to the high priest,
but to the prophet and the council.

799
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:15,623
I, presume to admonish His Majesty?

800
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:19,586
You forget, Hezrai, he is the king.
The king can do no wrong.

801
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:22,005
Well, something must be done.

802
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:28,636
Not by me. You are his chancellor, Hezrai,
and you his high priest, Zadok.

803
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,474
You do something. You reason with him.

804
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:35,810
We had hoped for the cooperation
of Your Highness.

805
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:41,566
You have it.
My sympathies and my best wishes.

806
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:45,362
We thank you for receiving us, Highness.

807
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:49,491
Not at all, not at all.
Always at your service.

808
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:56,581
JOAB: It could not have served
your interests better

809
01:12:56,623 --> 01:13:00,001
if your Highness had arranged
for this visit of Sheba's.

810
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:04,756
The priesthood is aroused against him.
The council condemns him.

811
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:07,717
Even the people talk openly of his shame.

812
01:13:08,802 --> 01:13:12,514
Your Highness
is reflecting my own thoughts.

813
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:15,475
I would be a fool
to ignore such an opportunity.

814
01:13:15,517 --> 01:13:19,354
You might have to wait forever
for another moment like this.

815
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,609
I will solve Hezrai's
and Zadok's problem for them,

816
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:27,487
and at the same time, my own.

817
01:13:27,529 --> 01:13:29,155
Or rather this is...

818
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:35,036
This is a problem that you, Joab,
with a little help, will solve.

819
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,539
I await your command, Highness.

820
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:42,585
(GONG RINGS)

821
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:54,514
Your Majesty commanded me
to attend upon her?

822
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:59,144
It took you long enough to get here.
I sent Takyan to bring you an hour ago.

823
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:02,188
Ten minutes ago, if Your Majesty pleases.

824
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:05,275
Come in.
Don't stand there arguing with me.

825
01:14:06,985 --> 01:14:10,488
In what way can I serve Your Majesty?

826
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:15,201
You can arrange
for my safe conduct out of Israel.

827
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:18,621
Stop looking at me like that!
Do as I tell you!

828
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:23,543
- But when, Your Majesty?
-Now. Today. This minute.

829
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:26,254
Your Majesty will pardon me
if I seem shocked, but...

830
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:30,884
Do I have to consult you first
concerning everything I wish to do?

831
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,343
Your Majesty would go

832
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:35,221
without accomplishing her purpose
in coming here?

833
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:40,226
Permit me to decide the question
of my comings and goings.

834
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:41,728
Your Majesty will forgive me

835
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:46,566
if I venture to touch
upon her personal, private affairs but...

836
01:14:46,608 --> 01:14:48,985
Get to the point, Baltor.

837
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:51,946
I have sensed a change in Your Majesty.

838
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:55,742
A softening. A desire to evade reality.

839
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:58,453
You are accusing me
of being in love with him?

840
01:14:58,536 --> 01:14:59,871
Is that it?

841
01:14:59,913 --> 01:15:04,042
I hope, for Your Majesty's own sake,
that such is not the case.

842
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:08,880
And if such is the case,

843
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:14,928
do you deny me the right
for the first time in my life to be human?

844
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:19,641
May I remind Your Majesty that
you cannot put your personal feelings,

845
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,017
no matter what they are,

846
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,937
above your commitment to the Pharaoh
and the good of your country.

847
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,688
Don't lecture me, Baltor.

848
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:27,232
It was Your Majesty who once told me

849
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:30,610
that you could not afford the luxury
of being a woman,

850
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:34,447
that always you were forced to remember,
above all else, that you are a queen,

851
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:38,785
that your only love, your only thought,
must be your duty.

852
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:41,496
And with that in mind,
Your Majesty came to Jerusalem

853
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:45,583
in search of a means to destroy
an enemy whom you once hated.

854
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:49,963
Yes, Baltor.

855
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:52,590
I have been trying to evade reality.

856
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:59,305
I have found myself trying
to forget the purpose for which I came,

857
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:02,517
as one would try to forget an evil dream.

858
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:07,897
I have been reluctant
to make an end of him.

859
01:16:09,148 --> 01:16:13,987
The most merciful way to kill is to thrust
quickly and strongly with the knife.

860
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:16,489
But it seems to me
that we are no nearer the kill

861
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:19,659
than we were before we came.

862
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:21,327
You are wrong, Baltor.

863
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:24,622
I have known for days
how to destroy Solomon.

864
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:33,047
Suppose I get his permission to hold
the rites of Rha-gon upon the soil of Israel,

865
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:37,719
to set up a pagan god
in the face of the great Jehovah,

866
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:40,471
their one God
who commands the Israelites

867
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:44,100
to have no other God before him?

868
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:47,979
That would cause more
than angry murmurings against him.

869
01:16:48,021 --> 01:16:51,858
The priests and the people
would rise up against Solomon.

870
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:54,193
Yes, Baltor.

871
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:57,322
His own people would accomplish his end.

872
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:06,456
Are you satisfied now
that I am still the Queen of Sheba?

873
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:11,794
Majesty.

874
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:32,065
How many times
shall I tell you that I love you?

875
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:35,401
Over and over,
until you make me believe it.

876
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,198
<i>I will.</i>

877
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:46,245
But you have known so many loves.

878
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:48,581
I will take you by the hand,

879
01:17:48,623 --> 01:17:52,835
and in the temple, before all Israel,
I'll pledge you my love in marriage.

880
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,965
To shut me away in your harem?

881
01:17:58,049 --> 01:18:00,051
To share your love?

882
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:02,595
No, to share my throne with you.

883
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:08,768
You honor me, but I am already a queen.

884
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:13,106
We will join our lands
as we will join our lives.

885
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:17,860
A dream that can never be.
Too much stands between us.

886
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:20,196
Nothing must stand between us.

887
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,951
Not even our gods?

888
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:28,454
I knew this moment would come,

889
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:31,958
for the things we believe in
are not the same.

890
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:36,796
I had hoped that in time
you'd come to accept Jehovah.

891
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:41,342
As King of Israel, would you abandon
the God of your people for mine?

892
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,265
Still I dared hope.

893
01:18:49,809 --> 01:18:53,563
My love, I must leave Israel.

894
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:56,941
Why? Why? I cannot let you go.

895
01:18:56,983 --> 01:19:01,070
The time has come
for the yearly feast of Rha-gon.

896
01:19:01,154 --> 01:19:05,241
Can you grant me permission
to hold it here in Israel?

897
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,368
It would be a sacrilege.

898
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:13,082
Then I must go to celebrate it elsewhere.

899
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,085
You see?

900
01:19:16,169 --> 01:19:19,547
You cannot banish
what stands between us.

901
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:25,178
No, wait. Listen to me.
There must be a way to...

902
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:28,556
No!

903
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:39,192

Joab.

909
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:34,247
Are you safe, Sire?

910
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:43,130
We'll deliver him to the one who sent him.

911
01:20:43,214 --> 01:20:44,882
Come on. Come on.

912
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:54,392
Thank all the gods you are not harmed.

913
01:20:55,810 --> 01:21:01,148
For the first time in my life, I...
I had no thought for myself.

914
01:21:02,275 --> 01:21:04,735
I feared only for him.

915
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,456
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

916
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:28,301
SOLOMON: You men, that way.
The rest follow me.

917
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:48,446
Are you expecting me
to plead for mercy from you?

918
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,281
In the past,
I have overlooked your hatred of me

919
01:21:50,323 --> 01:21:52,033
because of your great value to Israel

920
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:54,160
and because I pledged our father
never to turn against you.

921
01:21:54,201 --> 01:21:55,870
I asked for no such pledge.

922
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:59,582
But tonight you raised your hand
against the life of Israel.

923
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:03,169
You and your Sheban slut
have defiled the fair name of Israel.

924
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:07,214
I sought only to preserve our country
from your contamination.

925
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:11,469
Only because the blood of David
flows through your veins

926
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:14,722
as well as through mine
I grant you your life,

927
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:16,849
but I banish you from Israel forever.

928
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:19,185
I suppose I should be grateful to you
for your generosity,

929
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:22,104
but you should be more concerned
with the saving of your own life,

930
01:22:22,188 --> 01:22:25,399
if it has not already been lost
to the poison of Sheba.

931
01:22:25,483 --> 01:22:28,361
- Remove him, Josiah.
-Take him and him.

932
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:41,123
NATHAN: I charge you, Solomon,
to cleanse yourself of this iniquity

933
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:42,959
you have permitted to spawn in Israel.

934
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,585
Abjure this woman and her idolatries.

935
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:47,129
Tear down the obscene abomination
she has erected.

936
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:50,549
I have given her permission
to hold a sacred rite of her own religion

937
01:22:50,633 --> 01:22:52,218
in the privacy of the Vale of Seth.

938
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,720
A pagan revel! An orgy!

939
01:22:54,804 --> 01:22:57,390
I have no apology to make
for what I've done.

940
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,725
As I have commanded, so shall it be.

941
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:03,729
You have broken God's covenant
and his commandment.

942
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:06,107
"Thou shalt have no other gods
before me."

943
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:09,235
"Thou shalt not make unto thyself
any graven images."

944
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:13,197
"Thou shalt not kill."
But murder was attempted against me.

945
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:17,118
If Sheba had not escaped, the
assassins would not have spared her life.

946
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,370
The permission I have granted her
is poor compensation

947
01:23:19,412 --> 01:23:21,664
for the crime attempted against her.

948
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:27,086
It seems that in your lust for this woman,
you've lost your reason.

949
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:31,882
Choose your words carefully, Hezrai.
It is love I have for her.

950
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:35,136
It was out of love that I offered
to share this throne with her.

951
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:38,389
And out of love, I will attend her ritual.

952
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,059
Hear me, Solomon.

953
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:45,396
I've heard all I want to hear from you,
Prophet.

954
01:23:45,438 --> 01:23:48,274
Then hear the voice of God.

955
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:51,610
Your royal raiment will be stripped
from you and you will be cast forth.

956
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:53,738
You will cry out your repentance
in the streets,

957
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:57,575
but the ears and hearts of your people
will be closed against you.

958
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:01,954
And my ears are closed
to cackling priests and mumbling old men.

959
01:24:01,996 --> 01:24:05,291
I will show you I am king in Israel, not you.

My door was closed.

Must you intrude upon my privacy?

then please leave me alone.

I come seeking the man I once knew.

977
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:17,816
The man who was noble, gentle and kind,
the man who walked with God.

978
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:22,196
- These are mere words, Abishag.
-I entreat you to listen.

979
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:27,201
When I was a child,
you were the world and I adored you.

980
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:32,164
But time passed,
and love changed even as I did.

981
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:36,210
My love became
that of a woman for a man.

982
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:38,671
But the man became a king,

983
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:43,550
and in his eyes,
the woman was still a child.

984
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:58,482
I know how strongly it calls to you.

985

I cannot rest, Takyan.

1017
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:30,262
I have come to ask
Your Majesty's permission

1018
01:37:30,303 --> 01:37:34,683
to arrange for your immediate departure
out of Israel.

1019
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:38,937
Yes. Let us go, quickly.

1020
01:37:38,979 --> 01:37:44,734
There is no reason for us to remain
now that I have accomplished my purpose.

1021
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:52,075
Your Majesty should not reproach herself
over what has happened.

1022
01:37:52,117 --> 01:37:55,203
It was nothing more
than a sudden, violent storm.

It is not the first time
lightning has dealt death and destruction.

Nor will it be the last.

1025

Was it nothing more than a coincidence?

1026
01:38:05,714 --> 01:38:09,134
Surely Your Majesty cannot believe
what the Israelites are saying,

1027
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:14,014
that it was a sign of the anger
and revenge of their God?

1028
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:19,185
- I no longer know what I do believe.
-Oh, Majesty, you're overwrought.

01:38:19,269 --> 01:38:23,440
Yes, the strain of the last few days
has affected us all.

I have earned my reward from Egypt.

that you attend this meeting
of the council.

1043

It is a command
from the elders of the tribes.

If I had not come now,

I might have lost the courage
to come at all.

And I answered you with truth,

1050
01:40:30,275 --> 01:40:34,529
but I made it sound like a lie
to deceive you.

1051
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:38,241
For I was a friend of the Pharaoh
and an enemy of Israel,

1052
01:40:38,283 --> 01:40:42,245
and I came here out of hatred
to destroy you.

1053
01:40:46,624 --> 01:40:50,003
Had I known this
the day you arrived in Jerusalem,

1054
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:52,922
it would have changed nothing.

1055
01:40:52,964 --> 01:40:55,967
Mine is the greater guilt.

1056
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:59,637
For I have known from the first
where you would lead,

1057
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,806
where I would follow.

1058
01:41:05,518 --> 01:41:09,147
But why did you not just go
without explanations?

1059
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:14,152
Because I love you.
What I have done, I cannot undo.

1060
01:41:14,235 --> 01:41:19,282
Do with me what you will,
but this you must believe.

1061
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:21,826
My love is not a lie.

1062
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:45,809
Think not to appease the wrath
of Israel with words of remorse.

1063
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:49,437
Neither will God's anger be turned aside.

1064
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:51,898
I will speak no words in my defense.

1065
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:55,360
What could you say
in view of your transgressions?

1066
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:58,404
Because of you, dissension fills the land.

1067
01:41:58,488 --> 01:42:01,366
The unity of the nation is sundered.

1068
01:42:05,703 --> 01:42:07,914

1091
01:44:40,358 --> 01:44:43,653
and the captains of the host
have returned to their own provinces.

1092
01:44:43,695 --> 01:44:46,030
This is the time to strike, Majesty.

1093
01:44:46,072 --> 01:44:50,368
All Israel is in turmoil
and Solomon stands alone.

1094
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:55,081
It seems that your information
is more accurate than mine.

1095
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:59,544
Has not the Queen of Sheba given you
a full report on the situation in Jerusalem?

1096
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:04,007
I have been wondering,
awaiting word from her.

1097
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:07,176
You mean she has told you nothing
of what I have reported to you?

1098
01:45:07,218 --> 01:45:08,720
Nothing.

1099
01:45:09,846 --> 01:45:13,599
Perhaps in the joys of her new love,
she has forgotten her obligation to you

1100
01:45:13,683 --> 01:45:17,228
and finds her alliance with Solomon
more to her liking.

1101
01:45:18,771 --> 01:45:22,150
You have told me everything
I should know,

1102
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:27,905
excepting your price for my support of you
against your brother.

1103
01:45:27,989 --> 01:45:31,409
I want the crown of Israel.
It has always been mine.

1104
01:45:33,036 --> 01:45:36,581
And command of the army
that you send against Solomon.

1105
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,044
I grant it.

1106
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:43,629
But there's one thing I want from you.

1107
01:45:45,006 --> 01:45:48,426
You will be the instrument
of my punishment of Sheba

1108
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:50,595
for her betrayal of me.

1109
01:45:54,515 --> 01:45:57,310
On that, Majesty, you can rely.

1110
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:03,691
Hail to the new king of Israel.

1111
01:46:03,775 --> 01:46:06,611
ALL: Hail to the new king of Israel.

1112
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:09,030
(HORSE NEIGHING)

1113
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:26,255
Can your brother equal such strength?

1114
01:46:26,297 --> 01:46:29,759
He will be able to gather
only a handful of followers.

1115
01:46:29,801 --> 01:46:33,805
We will strike quickly.
The victory must be decisive.

1116
01:46:44,315 --> 01:46:48,194
- How many do they number?
-Thousands.

1117
01:46:48,277 --> 01:46:49,987
And you saw them cross over the border?

1118
01:46:50,071 --> 01:46:54,283
Yes, Majesty.
A column from horizon to horizon.

1119
01:46:58,538 --> 01:47:01,040
It was to be expected eventually.

1120
01:47:06,546 --> 01:47:09,507
We will go out and face the Egyptians.

1121
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:11,634
Give the orders, Josiah.

1122
01:47:12,885 --> 01:47:15,805
Gather what forces you can.

1123
01:47:15,847 --> 01:47:17,390
Yes, Sire.

1124
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:30,153
(INDISTINCT SINGING)

1125
01:47:33,156 --> 01:47:36,576
With these we hope to stem
the Egyptian hordes?

1126
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:37,952
My father, David, faced Goliath

1127
01:47:38,035 --> 01:47:40,830
with nothing more than a stone
and a shepherd's sling.

1128
01:47:40,872 --> 01:47:43,374
God was with David.

1129
01:47:43,416 --> 01:47:47,587
- Forgive me, Sire.
-There is nothing to forgive.

1130
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:51,257
All Israel knows that God
has abandoned the son of David.

1131
01:48:07,565 --> 01:48:12,069
Majesty, you let him go
without a word of farewell.

1132
01:48:12,153 --> 01:48:14,697
What could I have said to him?

1133
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:20,786
How could I have told him
that I carry his child?

1134
01:48:33,341 --> 01:48:35,551
- Halt.
-Halt!

1135
01:48:46,103 --> 01:48:50,274
- Highness, the enemy has been sighted.
-At what distance?

1136
01:48:50,358 --> 01:48:52,944
Within one hour's march.

1137
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:57,615
Then they have traveled 10 leagues
since dawn and we have traveled one.

1138
01:48:57,698 --> 01:49:01,786
They are spent and exhausted
and we are still fresh.

1139
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:04,705
Two hours yet before the sun sets.

1140
01:49:04,789 --> 01:49:07,083
- Deploy your men.
-Give the order.

1141
01:49:07,124 --> 01:49:11,796
We want every man, horse, chariot
hidden from Solomon's view!

1142
01:49:11,879 --> 01:49:16,842
And when he rides into the trap,
our attack will hit him from every quarter!

1143
01:49:16,926 --> 01:49:19,554
Now deploy for attack!

1144
01:49:19,637 --> 01:49:22,515
Deploy for attack!

1145
01:49:22,598 --> 01:49:25,268
Take your positions!

1146
01:49:25,309 --> 01:49:27,687
Deploy for attack!

1147
01:49:50,334 --> 01:49:52,795
Sire, our men are spent.
Shall we call a rest?

1148
01:49:52,837 --> 01:49:55,548
They will rest tonight
at the dunes of Saladar.

1149
01:49:55,631 --> 01:49:58,467
There we will entrench
and await the enemy.

1150
01:49:58,509 --> 01:50:02,179
Let the battle be joined
as far from Jerusalem as possible.

1151
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:10,354
Sire, look there on the hill.

1152
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:11,939
Halt the column.

1153
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:13,941
Halt!

1154
01:50:21,490 --> 01:50:23,326
Shumanites!

1155
01:50:26,954 --> 01:50:29,332
They bear a flag of friendship.

1156
01:50:33,836 --> 01:50:35,504
Ahab!

1157
01:50:35,546 --> 01:50:38,049
We come to stand with the king.

1158
01:50:39,842 --> 01:50:42,720
Why do you offer me your support
in this dark hour?

1159
01:50:42,803 --> 01:50:47,183
Is it because your hatred for the Egyptians
is greater than your hatred for me?

1160
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:51,395
We come in memory of the love
my daughter, Abishag, gave to you.

1161
01:50:56,484 --> 01:51:00,905
- Then we will honor that memory.
-God willing.

1162
01:51:00,988 --> 01:51:03,574
- Fall in behind!
-(HORSE NEIGHING)

1164
01:51:06,202 --> 01:51:10,498
Forward at the trot. Forward!

1165
01:51:58,295 --> 01:51:59,964
Start the attack.

1166
01:52:00,047 --> 01:52:01,298

with the Egyptians against you!

Break through! Break through! Faster!

1173
01:53:23,923 --> 01:53:27,051
Tell the Egyptians
to break through with their horsemen.

- Charge!</i>

01:54:27,403 --> 01:54:29,780
Joab, find Solomon!

1178
01:55:37,139 --> 01:55:39,016
Let's try over there.

1179
01:55:50,486 --> 01:55:54,198
Your Highness,
we've found Solomon's shield,

1180
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:56,367
but so far not Solomon.

1181
01:55:58,911 --> 01:56:01,413
He must have crawled off to hide himself
with the rest of his rabble.

1182
01:56:01,497 --> 01:56:03,332
In the morning,
we will dig them out of their burrows

1183
01:56:03,374 --> 01:56:04,708
and hunt them down to the last man.

1184
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:09,129
I have more important things
than to occupy myself with a rabbit hunt.

1185
01:56:09,213 --> 01:56:10,214
Keep searching.

1186
01:56:10,297 --> 01:56:14,176
There will be double the gold for the man
that brings me the head of Solomon.

1187
01:56:16,637 --> 01:56:18,722
I am impatient to enter Jerusalem.

1188
01:56:18,764 --> 01:56:21,892
I do not wish to be delayed
by the slow paces of an army.

1189
01:56:21,976 --> 01:56:25,771
You will have no trouble in destroying
the last remnants of Solomon's resistance.

1190
01:56:25,854 --> 01:56:27,523
When you have vanquished them
to a man,

1191
01:56:27,564 --> 01:56:30,317
then follow me into Jerusalem
with all speed.

1192
01:56:30,401 --> 01:56:32,695
How many men
will you need to enter Jerusalem?

1193
01:56:32,736 --> 01:56:33,862
Only a small escort.

1194
01:56:33,904 --> 01:56:36,407
I will meet with no more resistance there
than I've had here.

1195
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:39,201
Your commands will be obeyed.

1196
01:56:39,243 --> 01:56:44,081
Colonel Hassin, with six officers,
will go with His Majesty to Jerusalem.

1197
01:56:59,096 --> 01:57:03,267
There'll be few of us left to face Adonijah
and his Egyptians by tomorrow.

1198
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:06,687
The faint-hearted are deserting us
in the darkness.

1199
01:57:06,770 --> 01:57:08,856
Can you blame them, Josiah,

1200
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:12,609
after they've seen
even my own brother turn against me?

1201
01:57:12,651 --> 01:57:15,571
I thought I knew
the driving passion of his ambitions,

1202
01:57:15,612 --> 01:57:19,074
but never did I think
he would betray his own people.

1203
01:57:24,038 --> 01:57:26,915
We only found
a few scattered units of our people,

1204
01:57:26,957 --> 01:57:30,794
almost afraid to show themselves,
even in the darkness.

1205
01:57:33,881 --> 01:57:39,887
In the morning, the Egyptians
will march over us into Jerusalem.

1206
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:42,890
No matter how few of us are left,
we will fight on.

1207
01:57:42,973 --> 01:57:47,978
If I cannot live <i>as a</i> king, with honor,
at least I can die as a king, with honor.

Majesty!

1211
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,044
The outcry in the streets of the city
is over the news

1212
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:14,838
brought by deserters
from Solomon's army.

1213
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:18,425
It seems he has been defeated,
his men routed.

1214
01:58:21,386 --> 01:58:24,807
Is he among the dead?

1215
01:58:24,848 --> 01:58:27,810
No one knows, but all say that by morning

1216
01:58:27,851 --> 01:58:31,522
not one Israelite will escape alive.

1217
01:58:31,563 --> 01:58:33,899
Now will Your Majesty seek safety?

1218
01:58:33,982 --> 01:58:36,527
The Israelites will blame you
for Solomon's defeat.

1219
01:58:36,568 --> 01:58:40,781
I beg Your Majesty, do not refuse again.
You must save yourself.

1220
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:50,749
- Majesty, where are you going?
-Do not try to stop me, Baltor.

1221
01:58:50,833 --> 01:58:54,294
I will not let Your Majesty
take the risk of going into the streets.

1222
01:58:54,378 --> 01:58:56,046
Stand aside!

1223
01:59:03,804 --> 01:59:07,057
I command you both,
do not follow after me.

1224
01:59:14,690 --> 01:59:19,403
MAN: Solomon is vanquished!
How are the mighty fallen!

1225

Woe unto us!

The Lord has punished Solomon
for his sins!

1227
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:31,623
Who will save us now from Pharaoh?

1228
01:59:31,707 --> 01:59:35,169
Our sins have brought this upon us!

1229
01:59:35,252 --> 01:59:37,045
Woe unto us!

1230
01:59:37,087 --> 01:59:40,507
The Egyptians have overthrown
our noble Solomon!

1231
01:59:42,759 --> 01:59:45,262
Pharaoh will slay us all!

1232
01:59:47,306 --> 01:59:50,434
Solomon did not follow the path of God!

1233

God of Israel,

1234
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:21,757
thou who art called the all-knowing,
the compassionate,

1235
02:00:21,798 --> 02:00:25,928
look into my heart and hear my prayer.

1236
02:00:25,969 --> 02:00:29,640
Forgive my sin
against thee and thy people.

1237
02:00:29,723 --> 02:00:35,729
Grant me the life of Solomon
and preserve him against his enemies.

1238
02:00:35,812 --> 02:00:41,860
Do this, and I will return to the land
of Sheba and cast down the false gods.

1239
02:00:41,944 --> 02:00:47,199
And I will build a tabernacle
to the glory of thy name,

1240
02:00:47,282 --> 02:00:51,245
and there shall be
no other gods before thee.

Josiah.

1242
02:01:30,951 --> 02:01:34,621
- What has alarmed you, Sire?
-Not alarm, but hope.

1243
02:01:34,705 --> 02:01:37,624
Hope that comes like a light
in the midst of darkness.

02:01:37,708 --> 02:01:42,212
It is as though God has come to me
and showed me the way.

1245
02:01:44,298 --> 02:01:45,549
Yes?

1246
02:01:46,466 --> 02:01:47,801
Sire!

1247
02:01:55,017 --> 02:01:58,228
- Our men return.
-And there.

1248
02:02:08,363 --> 02:02:09,740
And there!

1249
02:02:32,763 --> 02:02:35,932
They rally to us by the hundreds.

1250
02:02:51,823 --> 02:02:56,578
Set them to burnishing their shields.
Let them shine like mirrors.

1251
02:02:58,121 --> 02:02:59,581
Yes, Sire.

1252
02:03:31,321 --> 02:03:35,951
I remember you once lectured me, Hezrai,
on how a king of Israel is crowned.

1253
02:03:39,079 --> 02:03:43,333
Are there any among you
who deny my right to sit upon this throne?

1254
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:50,507
Then I need no senseless ritual
to attend my elevation.

1255
02:03:53,844 --> 02:03:57,180
No anointing with the waters of Gihon.

1256
02:03:57,222 --> 02:04:00,976
I take with my own hands
what has always been mine.

1257

Hail Adonijah, Lion of Israel!

ALL: Hail Adonijah!

1259

Know this, all of you.
I have made an alliance with the Pharaoh.

1260
02:04:15,031 --> 02:04:18,118
Under his protection, I will rule Israel,

1261
02:04:18,201 --> 02:04:21,538
and I'll have no mercy
on any who oppose me.

1262
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:24,541
Sire, the Sheban harlot has been found.

1263
02:04:24,624 --> 02:04:27,210
She has taken refuge in the temple.

Again, the Israelites.

1267
02:05:07,209 --> 02:05:08,710
Where did they gather
that number of men?

1268
02:05:08,752 --> 02:05:11,421
Last night, we could find none of them,
only their dead.

1269
02:05:11,505 --> 02:05:14,925
In a few minutes, they will all be dead.

1270
02:05:15,008 --> 02:05:17,969
Today there is no darkness
into which they can escape.

1271
02:05:18,053 --> 02:05:21,223
They face east
and will be blinded by the sun.
