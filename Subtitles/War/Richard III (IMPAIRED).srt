00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,010
with bright hair dabbled with blood.

480
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,917
And he shrieked out aloud...

481
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:19,149
''Clarence is come!
False, fleeting, perjured Clarence...

482
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,885
''that stabbed me in the field
by Tewksbury!

Seize on him, Furies!
Take him to your torments!''

484
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:32,027
With that, methought
a legion of foul fiends environed me...

485
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:35,539
and howled in mine ears
such hideous cries...

486
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:39,440
that with the very noise
I trembling waked...

487
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,239
and for a season after...

488
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:48,649
could not believe
but that I was in hell...

489
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,211
such terrible impression
made my dream.

490
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,752
No marvel, my lord,
that it affrighted you.

491
00:39:57,828 --> 00:40:00,854
I promise you,
I am afraid to hear you tell it.

492
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,933
Oh, Brackenbury,
I have done those things...

493
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,596
which now bear evidence
against my soul...

and see how he requites me.

Oh, God, if my deep prayers
will not appease thee...

497

but thou wilt be avenged
on my misdeeds...

My soul is heavy...

Oh, princely Buckingham. I kiss thy hand.

- Good morrow, Catesby.
- God make Your Grace as joyful as you have been.

- But now the duke of Buckingham and I
have come from visiting His Majesty.

510
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,950
He hath revoked the order
for the execution of the duke, your brother.

What likelihood
of his amendment, lords?

By heaven,
I think there's no man secure...

but the queen's kindred
and night-walking heralds...

that trudge betwixt the king
and Mistress Shore.

Heard you not what an humble suppliant
Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?

517

Humbly complaining to her deity
got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.

I'll tell you what.
I think it is our way...

if we will keep in favor with the king
to be her men and wear her livery.

We speak no treason, man.
We say the king is wise and virtuous...

and his noble queen
well struck in years, fair and not jealous.

We say that Shore's wife
hath a pretty foot...

a cherry lip, a bonny eye...

533
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,117
a passing pIeasing tongue
and that the queen's kindred are made gentIefoIks.

00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,124
How say you, sir?
Can you deny all this?

535

- With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
- [ Snickers ] Naught to do with Mistress Shore?

536
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:23,459
I tell thee, fellow, he that doth naught with her,
excepting one, were best to do it secretly, alone.

- What one, my lord?
- Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?

I cannot tell. The world is grown so bad...

that wrens may prey
where eagles dare not perch.

Good time of day

As much unto
my good Lord Chamberlain.

- Well are you welcome to this open air.
- [ Chuckles ]

548
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,757
- How hath your Iordship brooked imprisonment?
- With patience, good Catesby, as prisoners must.

- My lord.
- Farewell, good Brackenbury.

But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
that were the cause of my imprisonment.

No doubt, no doubt.
And so shall Clarence, too.

552
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,163
For they that were
your enemies are his...

and have prevailed
as much on him as you.

More pity that the eagle

prey at liberty.

- No news so bad abroad as this at home.

557

The king is sickly, weak and melancholy,
and his physicians fear him mightily.

Now, by Saint Paul,

that I, forsooth, am stern
and love them not?

By holy Paul, they love His Grace but lightly
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.

Cannot a plain man

A plague upon you all.

His Royal Grace, whom God preserve
better than you would wish...

Come, come, we know your meaning,

Meantime, God grants
that we have need of you.

Our brother is imprisoned

myself disgraced and the nobility
held in contempt...

while great promotions
are daily given to ennoble those...

that scarce some two days since
were worth a noble.

594

By God who raised me
to this careful height...

595
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,212
from that contented hap
which I enjoyed...

596
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:02,156
I never did incense his majesty
against the duke of Clarence...

but have been an earnest advocate
to plead for him.

598
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:08,658
My lord, you do me shameful injury
falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

599
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:12,133
You may deny that you were not the cause
of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

- She may, my lord -
- She may, Lord Rivers.

Why, who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that.

602
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:21,068
She may help you to many fair preferments
and then deny her aiding hand therein...

603
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,170
and lay those honors
on your high desert.

604
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,080
Ha! What may she not?
She may, aye, marry, may she -

605
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,983
- What, marry, may she?
- ''What, marry, may she?'' Marry with a king...

606
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,986
a bachelor
and a handsome stripling, too.

607
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,887
I guess your grandam
had a worser match.

By heaven,
I will acquaint His Majesty...

611
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,955
with those gross taunts
I often have endured.

612

<i>What? Threat you me with telling of the king?</i>
<i>Tell him and spare not.</i>

Look, what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king.

614
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,504
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
'Tis time to speak, my pains are quite forgot.

00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:57,172
I had rather be a country servant-maid
than a great queen, with this condition...

616
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:00,148
to be thus baited,
scorned and stormed at.

617
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,515
Small joy have I
in being England's queen.

618
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,952
Ere you were queen, aye,
or your husband king...

619
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,956
I was a packhorse
in his great affairs...

620
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:10,391
a weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
a liberal rewarder of his friends.

621
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,758
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.

622
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,230
In all which time you
and your late husband...

623
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,233
together with his son Dorset here...

624
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:20,065
were factious for the house of Lancaster-
and, Rivers, so were you.

625
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:23,937
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
what you have been ere this, and what you are.

626
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,941
Withal, what I have been,
and what I am.

627
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,239
Poor Clarence did forsake
his father-in-law, Warwick-

628
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:30,473
Aye, and forswore himself-
which Jesu pardon -

629
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,481
to fight on Edward's party
for the crown.

630
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:35,040
And for his meed,
poor lord, he is mewed up.

631
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,279
I would to God
my heart were flint, like Edward's...

632
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,288
or Edward's soft and pitiful,
like mine.

633
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,290
I am too childish-foolish
for this world.

634
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,826
My lord of Gloucester,
in those busy days...

635
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,919
which here you urge
to prove us enemies...

636
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,590
we followed then our lord,
our lawful king.

637
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,828
So should we you,
if you should be our king.

638
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,927
If I should be?
I'd rather be a peddler.

639
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,097
Far be it from my heart,
the thought thereof.

640
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,107
As little joy, my lord,
as you suppose...

641
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:01,269
you should enjoy,
were you this country's king...

642
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:04,314
as little I enjoy,
being the queen thereof.

643
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,315
Dispute not with him.
He is lunatic.

644
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,613
Peace, Master Marquess,
you are malapert.

645
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,915
Your fire-new stamp of honor
is scarce current.

646
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:15,584
- What doth he say, my lord of Stanley?
- Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

647
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:18,651
They that stand high
have many blasts to shake them.

648
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,755
And when they fall,
they dash themselves to pieces.

649
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,767
Good counsel.
Marry, learn it, Marquess. Learn it.

650
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:28,396
- It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
- Aye...

651
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,838
and much more.

652
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,877
But I was born so high.

653
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,912
[ Richard ]
I was too hot to do somebody good...

654
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,311
that is too cold in thinking of it now.

655
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,316
Marry, as for Clarence,
he is well repaid.

656
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,443
He is franked up
to fatting for his pains.

657
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,453
God pardon them
that are the cause thereof.

658
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,751
A virtuous
and a Christian-like conclusion...

659
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,757
to pray for them
that have done wrong to us.

660
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,986
So do I ever,
being well-advised.

661
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,325
For had I cursed now,
I had cursed myself.

662
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:57,333
Madam, His Majesty doth call for you
and for Your Grace and you, my noble lords.

663
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:00,199
Catesby, we come.
Lords, will you go with us?

664
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,397
Madam, we will attend Your Grace.

665
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,772
Go you before, and I will follow you.

666
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:09,646
But soft...

667
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,045
But soft...

668
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,241
here come my executioners.

669
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:21,354
How now, my hardy, stout
resolved mates!

670
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,416
Are you now going
to dispatch this thing?

671
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,951
We are, milord, and come to have the warrant
that we may be admitted where he is.

672
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:29,555
Well thought upon.
I have it here about me.

673
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,624
Uh -

674
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:39,401
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution...

675
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,809
withal obdurate,
do not hear him plead...

676
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:46,872
for Clarence is well-spoken and perhaps
may move your hearts to pity if you mark him.

677
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,714
Tush! Fear not, milord,
we will not stand to prate.

678
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,754
Talkers are no good doers.

679
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,347
Be assured we come to use our hands
and not our tongues.

680
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:58,383
[ Chuckles ] Your eyes drop millstones
when fools' eyes drop tears, eh?

681
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,430
[ Both Chuckle ]

682
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:05,128
[ Chuckling ]
I like you, lads. About your business straight.

683
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,295
- Go, go, dispatch.
- We will, my noble lord.

684
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,044
In God's name, who are you,
and how came you hither?

685
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,810
I would speak with Clarence,
and I came hither on my legs.

686
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:22,613
- Be you so brief?
- O, sir, 'tis better to be brief than tedious.

687
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,120
Show him our commission
and talk no more.

688
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:35,094
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
the noble duke of Clarence to your hands.

689
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:40,929
I will not reason what is meant thereby,
because I will be guiltless of the meaning.

690
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,800
Here is the key.

691
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,936
There lies the duke asleep.

692
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:53,108
I'll to His Majesty and certify His Grace
that thus I have resigned my charge to you.

693
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:56,550
You may, sir.
It is a point of wisdom. Fare you well.

694
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:01,853
<i>I know thy charge, Brackenbury...</i>

695
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,916
and will take it.

696
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,328
<i>[ Door Opens ]</i>

697
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:41,456
Clout him over the head
with the hilts of thy weapon...

698
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,625
and then chop him
in the malmsey butt in the next room.

699
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,465
Aye, make a sop of him.

700
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,575
Where art thou, keeper?

701
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,183
[ Sighs ]

702
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,616
Give me a cup of wine.

703
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,525
You shall have wine enough,
my lord, anon.

704
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,588
[ Screaming ]

705
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,991
[ Screaming Stops ]

706
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,392
Why, so.

707
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:20,054
Now have I done a good day's work.

708
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,691
You peers,
continue this united league.

709
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:26,361
Madam, my mother...

710
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:28,836
I do crave your blessing.

711
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:32,033
I every day expect a summons
from my Redeemer...

712
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:34,042
to redeem me hence...

713
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,044
and now...

714
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,410
in peace my soul
shall part for heaven...

715
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:42,281
since I have left my friends
at peace on earth.

716
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,014
Rivers, Hastings...

717
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,024
take each other's hand.

718
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,559
Dissemble not your hatred...

719
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,925
swear your love.

720
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:56,295
By heaven, my heart is purged
from grudging hate...

721
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,130
and with my hand I seal
my true heart's love.

722
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:02,103
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like.

723
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:05,232
Take heed you dally not
before your king...

724
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:08,141
lest he that is
the supreme King of Kings...

725
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,145
confound your hidden falsehood...

726
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,704
and award either of you
to be the other's end.

727
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,444
So prosper I,
as I swear perfect love.

728
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:18,419
And I, as I love Hastings
with my heart.

729
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:23,520
Madam, yourself are not
exempt in this...

730
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,618
nor you, young Dorset -

731
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,822
Buckingham, nor you.

732
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:31,333
You have been factious
one against the other.

733
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:35,235
Wife, love Lord Hastings.

734
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:39,133
Let him kiss your hand.

735
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:42,337
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

736
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:47,076
There, Hastings. I will never more
remember our former hatred...

737
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,311
so thrive I and mine.

738
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,481
Dorset, embrace him.

739
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:56,923
Hastings, love Lord Marquess.

740
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:06,969
This interchange of love, I here protest,
upon my part shall be inviolable.

741
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,665
And so swear I, my lord.

742
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,902
Now, princely Buckingham,
seal thou this league...

743
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,434
with thy embracement
to my wife's allies...

744
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,811
and make me happy in your unity.

745
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:22,409
Whenever Buckingham doth turn
his hate on you or yours...

746
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:26,512
God punish me with hate in those
where I expect most love.

747
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,252
When I have most need
to employ a friend...

748
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,420
and most assured
that he is a friend...

749
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,521
deep, hollow, treacherous
and full of guile...

750
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,532
be he unto me.

751
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,534
This do I beg of God...

752
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:43,299
when I am cold in zeal
to you or yours.

753
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:47,971
<i>[ Edward ]</i>
<i>Apleasing cordial, princely Buckingham...</i>

754
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:51,172
<i>is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.</i>

755
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:55,217
There wanteth now
our brother Gloucester here...

756
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,947
to make the perfect period
of this peace.

757
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:02,550
[ Buckingham ]
And in good time here comes the noble duke.

758
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,958
Good morrow
to my sovereign king... and queen...

759
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,554
and, princely peers,
a happy time of day.

760
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,122
Happy, indeed,
as we have spent the day.

761
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,226
Brother, we have done
deeds of charity...

762
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,328
made peace of enmity,
fair love of hate...

763
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,873
between these swelling
wrong-incensed peers.

764
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,569
A blessed labor,
my most sovereign liege.

765
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,744
Among this princely heap...

766
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,716
if any here,
by false intelligence...

767
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:31,879
or wrong surmise,
hold me a foe -

768
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:34,082
If I unwittingly, or in my rage...

769
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:37,456
have aught committed that is hardly borne
by any in this presence...

770
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:40,826
I desire to reconcile me
to his friendly peace.

771
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,161
'Tis death to me to be at enmity.

772
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,930
I hate it,
and desire all good men's love.

773
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,870
First, madam,
I entreat true peace of you...

774
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,840
which I will purchase
with my duteous service.

775
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:56,245
Of you,
my noble cousin Buckingham...

776
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,678
if ever any grudge
were lodged between us -

777
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:03,447
of you, <i>Lord</i> Rivers,
and, <i>Lord</i> Grey, of you -

778
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,921
of you, my noble Marquess,
<i>lord</i> of Dorset -

779
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,322
that all without desert
have frowned on me -

780
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:12,759
dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen...

781
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,763
indeed, of all.

782
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,426
I do not know that Englishman alive
with whom my soul is any jot at odds...

783
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,901
more than the infant
that is born tonight.

784
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,467
I thank my God for my humility.

785
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:27,442
A holy day
shall this be kept hereafter.

786
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,536
I would to God all strifes
were well compounded.

787
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:34,105
My sovereign liege,
I do beseech Your Majesty...

788
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,379
to take our brother Clarence
to Your Grace.

789
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,387
<i>Why, madam...</i>

790
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:42,551
have I offered love for this
to be so flouted in this royal presence?

791
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,083
Who knows not
that the gentle duke... is dead?

792
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:50,232
You do him injury to scorn his corse.

793
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,130
Who knows not he is dead?

794
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:01,939
- Who knows he is?
- All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!

795
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,085
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset,
as the rest?

796
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,648
Aye, my good lord...

797
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:20,719
and no one in this presence
but his red color hath forsook his cheeks.

798
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:25,565
I-Is Clarence dead?
The order was reversed.

799
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:30,629
But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
and that a winged Mercury did bear.

800
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,073
Some tardy cripple
bore the countermand...

801
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:36,043
that came too lag to see him buried.

802
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:41,479
Who sued to me for him?

803
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:47,181
Who, in my rage, kneeled at my feet,
and bade me be advised?

804
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,623
Who spake of brotherhood?

805
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,626
Who spake of love?

806
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:56,563
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
the mighty Warwick and did fight for me?

807
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,966
Who told me,
in the field by Tewksbury...

808
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,470
when Warwick had me down,
he rescued me...

809
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:06,669
and said,
''Dear Brother, live and be a king''?

810
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,611
Who told me...

811
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,170
when we both lay on the ground
frozen almost to death...

812
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:15,479
how he did lap me
even in his own garments...

813
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:19,488
and gave himself, all thin and naked,
to the numb, cold night?

814
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:26,422
All this from my remembrance
brutish wrath sinfully plucked...

815
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:30,125
and not a man of you
had so much grace to put it in my mind!

816
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,190
Oh, God!

817
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,736
I fear...

818
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,604
thy justice will take hold
on me, and you...

819
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:41,667
and mine, and yours for this.

820
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,082
Come, Hastings, help me to my bed.

821
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,982
Oh!

822
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:54,216
Poor Clarence!

823
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,158
This is the fruit of rashness.

824
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,626
Marked you not
how that the guilty kindred of the queen...

825
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,857
looked pale when they did hear
of Clarence' death?

826
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,798
Oh, my good Lord Stanley,
they did urge it still unto the king.

827
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,630
- God will revenge it.

Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep...

830
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:18,740
to chide my fortune
and torment myself?

831
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:23,184
Oh, for my husband,
for my dear Lord Edward.

832
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:25,243
Comfort, dear madam.
God is much displeased...

833
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,414
that you take
with unthankfulness his doing.

834
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,583
Madam, bethink you,
like a careful mother...

835
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,854
of the young prince of Wales.

836
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,919
Send straight for him.
Let him be crowned.

837
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,931
In him your comfort lives.

838
01:00:35,999 --> 01:00:39,196
Drown desperate sorrow
in dead Edward's grave...

839
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:41,793
and plant your joys
in living Edward's throne.

840

841
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,807
have comfort.

842
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:49,868
All of us have cause
to wail the dimming of our shining star...

843
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:52,346
but none may help our harms
by wailing them.

844
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:55,646
Madam my mother, I do cry you mercy.
I did not see Your Grace.

845
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,380
Most humbly on my knee,
I crave your blessing.

846
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:00,752
God bless thee
and put meekness in thy mind...

847
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,758
love, charity, obedience
and true duty.

848
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:08,263
Amen, and make me die a good old man.
That is the butt end of a mother's blessing.

849
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,232
I marvel that Her Grace
did leave it out.

850
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,394
You cloudy princes
and heart-sorrowing peers...

851
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:17,132
that bear this mutual
heavy load of moan...

852
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:20,266
now cheer each other
in each other's love.

853
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,709
The broken rancor
of your high-swoln hearts...

854
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,839
but lately splinted, knit
and joined together...

855
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:29,316
must gently be preserved,
cherished and kept.

856
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:33,412
Meseemeth good
that with some little train...

857
01:01:33,489 --> 01:01:36,014
forthwith from Ludlow
the young prince be fetched...

858
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:38,458
hither to London
to be crowned our king.

859
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,962
Why with some <i>little</i> train,
my lord of Buckingham?

860
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,964
Marry, my lord,
lest by a multitude...

861
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,728
the new-healed wound of malice
should break out...

862
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,929
as well the fear of harm
as harm apparent...

863
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,938
in my opinion,
ought to be prevented.

864
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:52,304
I hope the king made peace
with all of us...

865
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:54,673
and the compact
is firm and true in me.

866
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:57,804
And so in me.
And so, I think, in all.

867
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,814
Yet, since it is but green...

868
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,373
it should be put
to no apparent likelihood of breach...

869
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:06,286
which haply by much company
might be urged.

870
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,789
Therefore I say
with noble Buckingham...

871
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:11,554
that it is meet so few
should fetch the prince.

872
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:13,595
- And so say I.
- Then be it so...

873
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,597
and go we to determine
who they shall be...

874
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,599
that straight shall post to Ludlow.

875
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:21,296
Madam, and you, my mother,
will you go to give your censures in this business?

876
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,395
With all our hearts.

877
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,366
My lord...

878
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:03,140
whoever journeys to the prince,
for God's sake, let not us two stay behind.

879
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,240
For by the way I'll sort occasion...

880
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:09,614
as index to the story
we late talked on...

881
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:15,489
to part the queen's
proud kindred from the prince.

882
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,589
My other self...

883
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:23,131
my counsel's consistory...

884
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:26,100
my oracle, my prophet.

885
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,067
My dear cousin...

886
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,767
I, like a child,
will go by thy direction.

887
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:34,776
Towards Ludlow then...

888
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,608
for we'll not stay behind.

889
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:19,478
Last night, I hear,
they lay at Northampton.

890
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:22,023
At Stony-Stratford
will they be tonight.

891
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,252
Tomorrow, or next day,
they will be here.

892
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:30,197
I long with all my heart
to see the prince.

893
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:32,734
I hope he is much grown
since last I saw him.

894
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:37,102
But I hear no. They say my son of York
hath almost overta'en him in his growth.

895
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,232
Aye, Mother,
but I would not have it so.

896
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:41,868
Why, my young grandson,
it is good to grow.

897
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,810
Grandam, one night
as we did sit at supper...

898
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,851
my uncle Rivers talked
how I did grow...

899
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,852
more than my brother.

900
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:53,047
''Aye,'' quoth my uncle Gloucester...

901
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:57,855
''Small herbs have grace,
great weeds do grow apace.''

902
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:01,892
Marry, they say
my uncle grew so fast...

903
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:04,990
that he could gnaw a crust
at two hours old.

904
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,297
'Twas full two years
ere I could get a tooth.

905
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:10,066
A parlous boy.
Go to, you are too shrewd.

906
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:12,869
Good madam,
be not angry with the child.

907
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:14,933

909
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:44,134
- Where is Her Majesty?
- She is above, my lord.

910
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:48,500
Here comes your kinsman
Marquess Dorset.

911
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:52,377
- What news, Lord Marquess?
- Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.

912
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,283
- How fares the prince?
- Well, madam, and in health.

913
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:03,348
What is thy news, then?

914
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:08,597
Madam, your brothers,
Lord Rivers... and Lord Grey...

915
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,894
are sent to Pomfret...

prisoners.

917
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,571
Who hath committed them?

918
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,971
The mighty dukes
Gloucester and Buckingham.

919
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:25,372
For what offense?

920
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,814
The sum of all I can,
I have disclosed.

921
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,981
Why, or for what,
our kinsmen are committed...

922
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:36,650
is all unknown to me,
my gracious lady.

923
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:40,184
Ay me,
I see the downfall of our house.

924
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:44,790
The tiger now hath seized
the gentle hind.

925

Accursed and unquiet wrangling days...

how many of you
have mine eyes beheld.

927
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:04,844
My husband lost his life
to get the crown...

928
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,287
and often up and down
my sons were tossed...

929
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:12,817
for me to joy or weep
their gain and loss.

930

01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,785
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

1085
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,852
My lord, will't please you pass along?

1086
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,329
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
will to your mother...

1087
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:53,095
to entreat of her to meet you
at the Tower and welcome you.

1088
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,295
What, will you
go unto the Tower, my lord?

1089
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,838
My Lord Protector
needs will have it so.

1090
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:00,136
I shall not sleep in quiet
at the Tower.

1091
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:04,042
- Why, what should you fear?
- Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.

1092
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:06,672
My grandam told me
he was murdered there.

1093
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:10,081
- I fear no uncles dead.
- Nor none that live, I hope.

1094
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:13,144
And if they live,
I hope I need not fear.

1095
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:19,390
But come,
and with heavy hearts...

1096
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,452
thinking on them...

1097
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,691
go we unto the Tower.

1098
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,718
Well, let them rest.

1099
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:57,788
Now, my lord,
what shall we do...

1100
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:02,735
if we perceive that the Lord Hastings
will not yield to our complots?

1101
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:06,140
Chop off his head, man.

1102
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,440
Somewhat we will do.

1103
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:23,948
Come hither, Catesby.

1104
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,191
Thou art sworn as deeply
to effect what we intend...

1105
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,697
as closely to conceal what we impart.

1106
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,200
Thou knowest our reasons
urged upon the way.

1107
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:35,600
What thinkest thou?
Is it not an easy matter...

1108
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,002
to make Lord Hastings of our mind...

1109
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:42,407
for the installment of this noble duke
in the seat royal of this famous isle?

1110
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:45,640
He for the late king's sake
so loves the prince...

1111
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:48,205
that he will not be won
to aught against him.

1112
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,081
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley?
What will he?

1113
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:54,418
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.

1114
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:57,414
Hmm.

1115
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,157
Well, then, no more but this.

1116
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,198
Go, gentle Catesby...

1117
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:07,827
and, as it were far off,
sound thou Lord Hastings...

1118
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,394
how he stands
affected unto our purpose...

1119
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,440
and summon him
tomorrow to the Tower...

1120
01:20:12,507 --> 01:20:14,475
to counsel on the coronation.

1121
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:18,639
If thou dost find him tractable to us,
encourage him and show him all our reasons.

1122
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:21,409
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling...

1123
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,951
be thou so too,
and so break off your talk...

1124
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:25,987
and give us notice of his inclination.

1125
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:29,251
I will, my lord.
Farewell, Your Graces both.

1126
01:20:30,625 --> 01:20:32,559
Catesby...

1127
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,822
commend me to Lord Hastings.

1128
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:37,922
Tell him his ancient knot
of dangerous adversaries...

1129
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,467
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey...

1130
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:43,299
tomorrow are let blood
at Pomfret castle.

1131
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:46,272
And bid my friend,
for joy of this good news...

1132
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:49,640
give Mistress Shore
one gentle kiss the more.

1133
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:51,645
My lord.

1134
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:25,636
<i>[ Whispers ]</i>
<i>My lord.</i>

1135
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,046
My lord.

1136
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:38,615
- Who knocks?
- <i>One from the Lord Stanley.</i>

1137
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,931
- What is't o'clock?
- Upon the stroke of 4:00.

1138
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,706
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep
these tedious nights?

1139
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:00,213
So it appears by that I have to say.

1140
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:02,512
First, he commends him
to your noble self.

1141
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,144
- <i>[ Soft Rattle ]</i>
- What then?

1142
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:08,553
Then certifies your lordship
that this night he had a dream -

1143
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:10,989
the boar razed off his helm.

1144
01:22:11,059 --> 01:22:13,391
Therefore he sends to know
your lordship's pleasure...

1145
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:15,429
if you will presently
take horse with him...

1146
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:17,931
and with all speed post with him
toward the north...

1147
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:20,900
to shun the danger
that his soul divines.

1148
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,028
Go, fellow, go,
return unto thy lord.

1149
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,971
Tell him his fears are shallow,
without instance.

1150
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,236
And for his dreams,
I wonder he's so simple...

1151
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:31,279
to trust the mockery
of unquiet slumbers.

1152
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:33,439
To fly the boar
before the boar pursues...

1153
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,540
were to incense
the boar to follow us...

1154
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,744
and make pursuit
where he did mean no chase.

1155
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,844
Go, bid thy master rise
and come to me...

1156
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:41,855
and we will both together
to the Tower...

1157
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,323
where he shall see
the boar will use us kindly.

1158
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,826
I'll go, my lord,
and tell him what you say.

1159
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:57,395
How now, sirrah.

1160
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:01,772
- How goes the world with thee?
- The better that your lordship please to ask.

1161
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:24,262
Many good morrows to my noble lord.

1162
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,596
Good morrow, Catesby.

1163
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:29,797
[ Chuckles ]

1164
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:33,137
You are early stirring.

1165
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:38,473
What news?
What news, in this our tottering state?

1166
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:40,605
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord.

1167
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:44,151
And, uh...

1168
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,915
I believe will never stand upright...

1169
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:49,388
till Richard
wear the garland of the realm.

1170
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,788
- How? Wear the garland?
- Mm-hmm.

1171
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:57,354
- Dost thou mean the crown?
- Aye, my good lord.

1172
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:59,832
I'll have this crown of mine
cut from my shoulders...

1173
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:02,995
before I'll see the crown
so foul misplaced.
