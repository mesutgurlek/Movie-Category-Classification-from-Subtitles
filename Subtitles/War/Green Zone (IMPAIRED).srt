00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,345
Hey! Hey! Hey,
hey, hey, hey!

313
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,572
What's going on, Sergeant?

314
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:02,909
Chief, they're pissed off.

315
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,381
They say there ain't no water.
All they want is water.

316

MILLER: There's nothing
we can do about that.

317
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:09,384
We just gotta get
our vehicles moving.

318
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,117
I want you to get the men
back in the vehicles now.

319
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,058
Hey! Hey!
SOLDIER: Get in the fucking car!

320
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,760
Get the fuck back!
Get the fuck back in your vehicle!

325
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,957
Okay, so we're convening an Iraqi
Freedom convention

326
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,797
here inside
the Green Zone tomorrow.

327
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,603
We are expecting to have representatives
from all 3 main ethnic groups,

328
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:06,542
the Kurds, the Shia and the Sunni,
angling for different levels of power.

329
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,274
It is our hope
that Ahmed Zubaidi

330
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,340
will emerge in
a leadership position.

331
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,481
Ben, are you satisfied that
we're in a good place now?

332
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,317
I think we're
in a good place now,

333
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,756
except for, perhaps, the press
we're getting from this looting issue.

334
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,758
Okay, well,
let's table that for now.

335
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,023
In terms of stabilization...

336
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,895
Zubaidi hasn't been
here for 30 years.

337
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,767
Well, he's the best bet we have right now
for a stable democracy.

338
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,900
You find me 10 guys in Baghdad
who even know who he is.

339
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,274
Well, he's our friend, Marty.
He's been very helpful.

340
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,937
Our office is
extremely satisfied

341
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,676
with all the information
that we've gotten from him.

342
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,218
Zubaidi's been selling us
a crock of shit for years.

343
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,278
This guy is not reliable.
His intelligence is not reliable.

344
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,050
His report chain
is not reliable.

345
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,525
This is exactly why people are losing
confidence in the Agency, Marty.

346
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,728
You're questioning every single piece
of intelligence that's coming in,

347
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,697
up to the point where
we can't make any progress.

348
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,599
You cannot just hand this country over
to an exile no one's ever heard of

349
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,534
and a bunch of interns
from Washington.

350
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,572
Well, you're
a Middle East expert, Marty.

351
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,733
If you got a better idea, why don't
you just throw it out here on the table?

352
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:13,300
We need to use
the Iraqi army to help us.

353
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,472
This country is a powder keg
of ethnic division.

354
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,142
Now Saddam is gone, they're the only
ones who can hold this place together.

355
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,651
We're not selling that
to the American people.

356
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,414
We beat the Iraqi army.
Right.

357
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,977
Well, they're still out there
and they're armed,

358
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,546
and they're looking
for a place in the new Iraq.

359
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,057
They're going to be
waiting a long time.

360
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,888
They didn't all
follow Saddam.

361
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,656
There are officers
we can work with out there,

362
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,787
if we make it
worth their while.

363
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,262
Hey, let me tell
you something.

364
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,095
We've spent too
much American treasure

365
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,657
and too many American lives

366
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,067
for us to put a Ba'athist general
into a position of power.

367
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:43,073
Have you any idea what's going on
outside the Green Zone?

368
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,235
It's chaos. No police,
revenge killings every night.

369
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,438
People are asking
why we can't stop this.

370
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,242
We are losing the population.
Democracy is messy.

371

Democracy is messy.

372
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,112
If you dismantle this country
and cut out the army,

373
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,280
you'll have civil war in 6 months.

374
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,550
I guarantee it.

of the meeting.

773
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,676
And I was in the process
of figuring out what the fuck it was

774
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,275
when SF showed up
and snatched him.

775
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:51,918
God damn!

776
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,684
Okay, but where
did they take him?

777
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,918
Because if you can get me
access to this guy,

778
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,654
I'll get Al Rawi.

779
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,761
Look, we're both
after the WMD, right?

780
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,594
It's a little more
complicated than that.

781
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,400
Well, not to me, it isn't.

782
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,671
All right, I'll make a call,
get you reassigned.

783
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:17,305
There are some empty buildings on
the other side of the compound.

784
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,747
Get out of uniform and
report to my office in an hour.

785
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,307
Outstanding.

786
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,863
How'd you get
the bloody nose?

787
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,992
Oh, that's a long story.

788
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,763
You're in the 85th.
That's WMD unit, right?

789
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:44,733
How did you know that?

790
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,571
It's right there
on your rifle.

Lawrie Dayne, Wall Street Journal.
How's it going?

792
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:55,310
You know, we haven't found shit yet.
Hey, Sergeant Perry.

793
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:57,376
We'll find it.
It's frustrating, right?

794
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:58,580
Little bit.

795
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,488
So what are you
and Marty talking about?

796
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,856
Oh, you know I can't
talk to you about that.

797
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,417
Oh, come on.

798
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,659
You come in fresh off the field to
have a lemonade with Martin Brown?

799
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,064
Something's gotta be going on.

800
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,834
Well, you could ask him.

801
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,201
I'm asking you.

802
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,673
Does it make sense to you that
we're still coming up empty?

803
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,371
No. No, it doesn't.

804
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,839
Someone told us
they were there, right?

805
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,179
If you come
across anything,

806
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,447
call me.

807
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,963
I'll keep it in mind.

812
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:17,855
For about 10 minutes.

wife and kids again? You have 5 kids.

where to look for this man,

General Al Rawi.

to get an answer,

tell me something.

Hey, Chief, Clark Poundstone,
Pentagon Special Intelligence Unit.

838
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,606
A great job bagging Hamza.

839
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,477
Thanks. Appreciate it.

840
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,076
Walk you out?

841
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,879
Sure.

842
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,955
You're with our MET Team, right?
Yeah.

843
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:56,993
Well, the administration really appreciates
the work you guys are doing.

844
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,187
We gotta get this WMD
issue behind us

845
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:02,129
so we can get on with the challenges
of the future.

846
00:50:02,199 --> 00:50:03,894
That's where this Hamza guy
could be helpful.

847
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,764
He's confirmed
a few facts for us.

848
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,135
Says your guys might have
lifted a notebook from him.

849
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,868
Well, everything
I got off him I gave to Martin Brown.

850
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,569
Why don't you ask him
if he's got it?

851
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,133
(CHUCKLES)
I don't think Marty would go for that.

852
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,612
He's a hell of a guy, but he's been
in the Middle East a long time.

853
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,149
He's got a lot of
preconceived ideas.

854
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,378
Our unit's trying to get
back to the raw intel.

855
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,680
Look, I don't want
to throw Marty under a bus,

856
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,552
but he doesn't like
what we're coming up with.

857
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:27,681
The guy's a dinosaur,

858
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:31,250
and we need to get some new thinking
going on around here.

859
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:34,229
There's an opportunity
for you here, Miller.

860
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,730
I know Marty's pulled
you in temporarily,

861
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,735
but if you're looking for something
more permanent, I can help.

862
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:44,929
We're doing a good thing here.
We're going to rebuild this place.

863
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:46,976
People are watching us.

864
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,439

865
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:52,846
You do that.

866
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:56,842
If you hear anything about
that notebook, let me know.

867
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,289
Your friend from the Pentagon
Special Intelligence Unit came to see me.

868
00:51:04,363 --> 00:51:05,352
Poundstone?

869
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,658
Yeah, Poundstone.

870
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:10,293
Poundstone's unit pushed all that WMD
intel you've been chasing your tail on.

871
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:12,030
What? You mean Magellan?

872
00:51:12,104 --> 00:51:13,799
Who is Magellan?
Have you ever met him?

873
00:51:13,872 --> 00:51:14,964
No.

874
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,803
Poundstone's got him
locked up tight.

875
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:19,810
That's why we gotta find out
what's going on.

876
00:51:20,012 --> 00:51:21,138
Here's the deal.

877
00:51:21,213 --> 00:51:22,339
We checked the notebook.

878
00:51:22,414 --> 00:51:25,008
It's a list of addresses around Baghdad,
mostly Adhamiya.

879
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:28,075
It's a Sunni stronghold,
very sympathetic to the army.

880
00:51:28,153 --> 00:51:30,212
More than likely,
that's where Al Rawi is.

881
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:32,689
The notebook's probably his line
to his battalion commanders.

882
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:33,782
We all set?

883
00:51:33,859 --> 00:51:35,656
Not yet. We're waiting
on military support.

884
00:51:35,727 --> 00:51:39,163
Push them hard. I want to
get every address in that book.

885
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:40,789
MILLER: So, what do you think
that meeting was about?

886
00:51:40,866 --> 00:51:43,334
What would you be talking about
if you just got invaded?

887
00:51:43,402 --> 00:51:45,597
You think Al Rawi
wants to fight?

888
00:51:45,671 --> 00:51:47,935
If we don't make him
an offer, he will.

889
00:51:48,006 --> 00:51:49,997
What? You're going
to cut a deal?

890
00:51:50,075 --> 00:51:53,238
You're going to cut a deal
with the Jack of Clubs?

891
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:56,574
What do you think
you're doing here, Miller?

892
00:51:56,648 --> 00:51:58,582
You're off reservation
for a reason. What is it?

893
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:01,619
Well, I came to find weapons
and save lives.

894
00:52:01,687 --> 00:52:03,484
And I didn't find shit.

895
00:52:03,555 --> 00:52:05,182
I want to know why.

896
00:52:05,257 --> 00:52:08,226
There are no easy answers. If you
want that, go work with Poundstone.

897
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:10,284
All we got is hard choices.

898
00:52:10,362 --> 00:52:11,954
You want to know what
happened to the weapons?

899
00:52:12,364 --> 00:52:14,298
We gotta find Al Rawi
and bring him in.

900
00:52:14,366 --> 00:52:16,027
He'll give us
the truth about WMD

901
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:20,231
and give us a shot at standing this
country up without a bloodbath.

902
00:52:20,973 --> 00:52:23,100
Do you want the job or not?

903
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:28,102
Yeah, I want it.
Good.

have him under wraps.

906
00:52:34,386 --> 00:52:36,820
So, how are you going
to get to him?

907
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:38,583
I'm not. You are.

908
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:40,655
Here's a pass.

909
00:52:40,726 --> 00:52:44,526

we can use to get you in.

way below their radar.

911
00:52:47,733 --> 00:52:50,600
Use him as an excuse
to get to Hamza.

912
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:52,534
Here's a million
dollars in cash.

913
00:52:52,604 --> 00:52:55,232
Tell Hamza the money's his
if he gives us what we need.

914
00:52:55,407 --> 00:52:58,240
You tell him if
he gives Al Rawi to me,

keeps his mouth shut
over there until I bring him in,

916

I'll have him and his family out of
the country by the end of the week.

917
00:53:04,816 --> 00:53:07,808
You want me to tell him to not
talk to the American interrogators?

918
00:53:07,886 --> 00:53:09,410
That's right.

919
00:53:12,024 --> 00:53:14,652
I thought we were
all on the same side.

01:41:58,714 --> 01:42:00,875
Magellan.
You made him up.

1390
01:42:01,884 --> 01:42:04,978
I don't know what
you're talking about, Miller.

1391
01:42:06,021 --> 01:42:08,251
When you peddled that shit in DC,
did they know it was a lie?

1392
01:42:08,324 --> 01:42:09,655
Or did they just
never bother to ask?

1393
01:42:09,725 --> 01:42:10,953
Okay, okay.

1394
01:42:11,026 --> 01:42:14,018
Come on, none of this matters anymore.
WMD? This doesn't matter.

1395
01:42:14,096 --> 01:42:16,394
What the fuck are you talking about?
Of course, it fucking matters.

1396
01:42:16,465 --> 01:42:18,592
The reasons we go to war
always matter!

1397
01:42:18,667 --> 01:42:21,636
It's all that fucking matters.
It fucking matters.

1398
01:42:21,704 --> 01:42:23,399
At ease, soldier.

1399
01:42:25,975 --> 01:42:28,341
Do you have any idea
what you've done here?

1400
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:31,004
What's going to happen next time
we need people to trust us?

1401
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,138
AIDE: Clark!

1402
01:42:32,214 --> 01:42:33,875
We're not turning
back, Miller.

1403
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:35,173
We won.

1404
01:42:35,251 --> 01:42:36,309
AIDE: Clark!

1405
01:42:36,385 --> 01:42:39,047
Son of a bitch. What?

1406
01:42:51,333 --> 01:42:53,198
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

1407
01:42:54,003 --> 01:42:56,597
(ALL ARGUING IN ARABIC)
