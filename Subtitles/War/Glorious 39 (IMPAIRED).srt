00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,595
What happened to her sister, Anne?

40
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,273
(WALTER) She was an actress.

41
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,396
She was indeed.
She made some films.

42

She played the best friend

That's her, up there.

Anne was the oldest.

45
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,351
She was adopted, of course.

46
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,353
As frequently happens,
they were desperate for children.

47
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,590
But they didn't think
they could have any,

48
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,035
and so they adopted one.

49
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,192
And then, lo and behold,
along came the babies anyway.

50

They were all very close.

00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,840
We're not sleepwalking
towards disaster.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,639
We're going up to it,
welcoming it with open arms.

160
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
I've certainly been known
to do that in my time.

161
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,829
Precisely in what way
are we doing that?

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,958
I will tell you precisely.
We're not content with letting Hitler

163
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,997
march into Czechoslovakia
and Austria.

164
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,119
Now we're saying, "That's all right,
old chap. Take some more countries."

165
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,998
- Are we saying that?
- Yes, we are.

166
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,311
Hitler wants to take over Europe,
and we are letting him do it

167
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,631
so long as he doesn't bother us.
That can't be allowed.

168
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,677
Forgive a statement that's obvious,

169
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,159
or what I think is obvious,

170
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,197
but evil has to be stood up to.

171
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,920
But one has to be
in a position to do that.

172
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,117
- One has to have the means.
- We've got the bloody means!

173
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,111
Even if we have let Germany re-arm,

174
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,396
we mustn't exaggerate
how strong she is!

175
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,518
Under this current government of
Mr Chamberlain, my own leader,

176
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,035
we are behaving as if
we have to avoid war

177
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,599
at absolutely all costs.

178
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,877
So every day we do something
that makes the situation worse.

179
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,792
Do you really think that is true?

180
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,712
What did you have in mind?

181
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,838
To give you one example,
I've heard rumours.

182
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,355
I've heard the most
extraordinary rumours

183
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,670
that we are trying
to interest the Nazis

184
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,991
in accepting a gigantic secret loan,

185
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,391
which we will negotiate for them
on the international markets,

186
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,757
so they might turn their armament
industry back to peaceful means.

187
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,354
We are actually planning
to give them money!

188
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,670
That does sound truly bizarre,
Hector.

189
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,593
Alexander fought in the war,
got wounded,

190
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,432
so I don't criticise him,

191
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,830
but not enough other people
are speaking out.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,117
It's up to young MPs like me
to get rid of our present leadership,

193
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,157
which is leading us
towards our doom.

194
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,880
That is... quite a claim, Mr Haldane.

195
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,918
Yes, and I'm aware
it isn't a popular thing to say

196
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,152
the present leadership will stand
no opposition or criticism.

197
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,959
The present leadership
view Mr Churchill as dangerous

198
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,838
because he would stand up to Hitler.

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,356
He doesn't care
about giving offence to the Nazis.

200
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,637
So I feel I have to do
everything in my power

201
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,315
to make sure Mr Churchill
is not ignored.

202
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,914
Come on Thursday.

203
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,679

in the afternoon.

- Yes.

205

he could be right.

She got into one of the sheds.

She didn't realise
it was forbidden territory.

Mr Balcombe asked if he could store
some government overflow with us.

The government needs
to store things here?

It seemed a harmless thing to do.

265
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,832
The reason he gave is interesting,
and quite funny, and rather rude.

266
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,194
He said there were so few places

267
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,316
where one can trust
the servants won't go any more,

that wasn't a worry here.

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,711
He said that?

and of course I'm coming.

Oh, yes. Hector Haldane.

Always thought
he had a marvellous name.

348
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,308
He was one of the young
Members of Parliament

349

speaking out against
appeasing Herr Hitler.

350

I read one of his speeches once.
Passionate stuff.

351
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,069
He's been calling for a change
at the top for a new prime minister.

- No.

Lawrence didn't tell me very much.

370
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,150
He said he thought Hector
had killed himself.

371
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,311
It's possible. He was excitable.

372
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,753
But there was something
very touching about him.

373
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,912
And very brave.

You've already met Kathleen,

Oh, yes.

he is an improvement on the last one.

Yes.

I was just thinking about
Mr Balcombe. What does he do, Papa?

386
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,360
He works at the Home Office
doing various things.

387
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,556
He's in the secret service.
It's obvious.

388
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,438
Is he?

389
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,670
Would he have taken
an interest in Hector?

390
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,196
Very possibly, but I don't think
he can have bumped him off.

391
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,432
Bumped him off?
Oh, Anne, your love of the dramatic!

392
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,636
No, I didn't mean that, of course.

393
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,916
Mind you, he is rather spooky.

394
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,278
He seems a little odd, I admit,
but he shares my love of fishing.

395
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,079
It's just... Hector seemed
worried about him.

00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,719
He's gone!

469
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,792
I was just there, and
I turned round and he was gone,

470
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,918
- and the pushchair vanished!
- Calm down.

471
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,674
- He can't have gone far.
- They took the pushchair!

472
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,115
- Oh, my God!
- I found his shoe.

473

we can cover a lot of ground.

- Oliver!

I think we should take this path.

477
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,628
But I've looked here. Of course I have.

478

We're following the path!

479
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,439
- I've been down this path.
- Everything's all right.

480
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,716
Everything's going to be all right.

481
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,192
He's not anywhere here.
I've looked here, of course I have!

The panic's over.

488

I'm sorry!

489
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,030
(ELIZABETH) How on earth
did he get there?

490
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,476
I don't know. I really don't know. I...

491
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,474
I must have fallen asleep
for a few seconds and... he was gone.

492
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,633
- Somebody moved him.
- Somebody moved him?

493
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,951
Maybe you were concentrating
so much on your lines, darling,

494
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,715
- you walked with him, not realising.
- I didn't walk with him!

495
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,316
- I didn't move him!
- Are you sure about that?

496
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,153
- You said you fell asleep.
- I didn't walk with him.

497
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,436
I didn't move him,
I'm absolutely certain.

498
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,592
I did not move him!

499
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,350
He did have a hell of a lot
packed away in our sheds.

500
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,112
I hear they've got
the Duke of Wellington

501
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,158
to take several tons
of confidential material

502
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,594
and put it in his basement!

503
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,320
They're so worried
about Communist infiltration,

504
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,710
they'd rather put it
in a duke's wine cellar.

505
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,474
What excuse did you give, Papa,
to make him take it all away?

506
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,756
I said in winter the sheds all leak.

507
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,150
I didn't move the baby.
You ought to believe me.

508
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,038
- I do.
- Then who moved him?

509
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,589
- It was Walter.
- Walter?

510
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,593
- Why would he do that?
- Maybe it WAS the boy. Who knows?

511
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,035
Perhaps he'd had wine
when we weren't looking.

512
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,872
Or somebody
asked him to move him.

513
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,235
Why would they do that, darling?

514
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,073
To make me seem unreliable,
a bit dotty.

515
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,550
He knows I'm friends
with Lawrence and with Hector.

516
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,713
I think we should let Mr Balcombe
disappear with all his boxes

517
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,075
and just not invite him again - ever.

518
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,595
We want to be sure we get rid of him,

519
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,432
which I'm sure we can do.

520
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,160
We've lost a terrific chance
to do a lot of snooping.

521
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,070
- So, I think that is everything.
- Including all the foxtrots?

522
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,359
I believe so, yes.

523
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,392
And there's nothing left behind
in here, is there?

524
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,516
- In the house?
- I don't think so, Joseph.

525
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,113
No.

526
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,998
No. I don't know of anything.

527
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,672
- (KNOCKING)
- Come in.

528
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,519
I just wanted to see how you are.

529
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,638
I'm absolutely fine.
There's nothing wrong with me.

530
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,711
Of course not.

531
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,189
Anyway, the spooky man
has gone at last.

532
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,113
Papa says we're returning
to London in the morning.

533
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,599
- Really?
- Yes.

534
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,955
Because Parliament
may be about to be recalled.

535
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,712
It's a bit of a crisis, apparently.

536
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,678
But I think it's terrific we're going.

Nowadays I can't stand it
down here after a couple of weeks.

We had no idea you were
coming back to London today.

545

And Mrs Hardiman is not back
till the end of the week.

(ALEXANDER) No need
to alarm yourself, Betty.

We live in unpredictable times.

548

We can manage without Mrs Hardiman.

00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,949
And there is this awful racket
from next door, sir.

550

They're getting ready for a party.

- I'm sure it will all be fine.

As long as they don't
throw anything into our garden.

it's a very sensitive subject,

but with my new job,
I have access to all sorts of things,

and I know who to ask
to find out even more.

So... only if you wish it, of course,

who your real parents were.

00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,591
It may or may not be going up.

620
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,433
Should we be held
to our promise to Poland?

621
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,751
Do we really want to go to war for them?

622
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,911
Can this be happening all over again?

623
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,594
That's what's going on.

624
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,389
They're all travelling back from
their country estates as we speak.

625
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,075
It's as bad as that.
There's nothing you can do, Glorious.

626
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,038
You go on making your movie.
Cheer people up.

627
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,474
I can't just do that,
I have to do something more.

628
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,437
No, this is good advice.

629
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,388
It's an absolutely splendid thing
to cheer people up.

630
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,949
They're not going to do our scene
today. They've told us to go.

631
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,793
Not today? I don't believe it!

632
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,359
We will never be needed.

633
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,795
The weather's not right, apparently.

634
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,238
I've managed to get my father's
chauffeur to pick us up.

635
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,436
Will you come home with me, Gilbert?

636
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,398
Who could resist such an invitation?

637
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,279
I want to play you something, in private.

638
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,192
It's this gramophone record.

639
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,715
You're much better informed
about everything.

640
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,155
Flattery as well! Today is looking up.

641
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,312
We just have to pick up
my brother and sister at a ball.

642
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,592
(ANNE) It's not too far.

643
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,275
This is the way to travel
for a poor boy like me.

644
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,714
Always dreamt
I'd have a car like this as an actor.

645
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,555
Hasn't happened yet.
Never got above the title.

646
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,153
Not even once.

647
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,951
(GILBERT)
Time for some riotous living,

648
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,078
for no one has any idea
what's going to happen tomorrow.

649
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,715
So, what's the tune
you want to play me?

650
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,758
It's not a tune, it's a conversation.

651
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,598
It's a recording of a meeting.

652
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,435
I found it among things Mr Balcombe
was storing with us in Norfolk.

653
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,639
There was another record as well,
of Hector screaming, really upset.

654
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,155
The man who killed himself?
Where is it?

655
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,117
It's broken. It got smashed.

656
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,272
Since the baby and the pushchair,
you don't trust what I say.

657
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,839
When did I say that?

658
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,356
I know it's my fault I haven't read
more about the political situation,

659
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,999
being too bound up with my work.

660
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,755
It's conceivable the secret service
are listening in and recording

661
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,071
the conversations
of those opposed to the government.

662
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,993
- That is possible?
- Extremely possible.

663
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,754
Yes, and that spying
and these recordings

664
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,718
could be used to put pressure
on people, couldn't they?

665
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,235
To blackmail them into silence,
if necessary.

666
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,789
- That too is possible, if risky.
- Yes,

667
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,349
because they wouldn't wish that
to become public.

668
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,080
No! lmagine what the supporters
of Winston Churchill

669
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,071
would do with information like that.

670
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,356
It would bring down
the present leadership,

671
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,476
Churchill would become Prime Minister,

672
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,518
that would lead to a bolder approach
to Germany!

673
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,910
Blackmail. Well, I never.

674
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:14,119
Although it's... possible, of course,
that elements in the secret service

675
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,556
are taking things further
than the Prime Minister intended.

676
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,278
Is that what's on that recording?

677
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,910
Oh, no, no.
It's merely a boring meeting.

678
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,152
But I thought perhaps you would know
who the people were.

679
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,515
Why would they record a boring meeting?

680
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,875
Perhaps because somebody
couldn't be there

681
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,758
and they didn't want notes taken?

682
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,150
That's just
a slightly drunken actor's guess.

683
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,357
But now, if war comes,
none of this matters.

684
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,592
On the contrary, my dear,
it will matter all the more.

685
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,000
Some of these people don't want a war.

686
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,879
They don't want Winston Churchill
as Prime Minister.

687
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,190
They want this country to be left alone.

688
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,749
They don't care
what's happening in Europe

689
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,309
as long as this lovely place
is not disturbed.

690
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,994
They'll want to make peace
as soon as they can,

691
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,116
maybe at any price,

692
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,999
and give Hitler
all sorts of things in return.

693
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,433
But we shouldn't worry.

694
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,319
We will be looking down at everybody
from a cinema screen

695
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,358
dressed in ludicrous Victorian dress.

696
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,153
That is, if we ever get our call.

697
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,389
(RALPH) Hello! Hello, down there!

698
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,635
There you are!

699
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,918
You're so early. You're much too early.

700
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,640
It is nearly 3 o'clock
in the afternoon, Celia.

701
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,189
You missed something gorgeous.

702
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,318
There were exotic birds
and fountains of gold water.

703
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,152
And Aunt Elizabeth is still here.

704
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,834
Like me, she hasn't slept all night.

705
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,954
So you've been up all night,
Aunt Elizabeth?

706
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:28,669
Yes. Still to go to bed!

707
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,478
I stayed up with the young people.

708
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,279
Haven't done that for years.
What amazing times we live in!

709
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,431
I was meant to go hours ago,
but I never did.

710
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,636
- (CHUCKLES)
- Oh, Mr Williams!

711
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,631
Just the person I want to see.

712
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,712
- I am?
- You must come over here, come on,

713
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,440
and hear what I've got to tell you.

714
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,993
I've been tidying up my house,
or rather the servants have,

715
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,673
in case we have to run like mice,

716
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,308
and you'll never guess
what they have unearthed.

717
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,596
My whole collection
of theatre programmes,

718
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,069
- many of them featuring you.
- (CHUCKLING) No!

719
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,951
Mm. You in <i>Richard II</i>
and in <i>The Last Days of Pompeii...</i>

720
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,951
Marvellous! I'd love to see them.

721
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,473
(WHISPERS)

722
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,551
You'll have to come with me now,

723
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,029
because if this irritating war
breaks out,

724
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,872
the whole thing will get scattered.

725
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,032
You don't mind coming to my little
house by St Paul's after tea?

726
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,350
- Not at all. That'd be thrilling.
- Gilbert.

727
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,115
My career in theatre programmes.
I never kept anything.

728
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,998
- I was superstitious.
- Gilbert.

729
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,798
- Milk?
- Thank you. Hmm?

730
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,188
We had an appointment.

731
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,039
Yes... Give me what you want me
to listen to, dear,

732
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,715
the record, and I'll listen to it
when I get home, I promise.

733
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,474
(RALPH) I'd love to have seen
<i>The Last Days of Pompeii.</i>

734
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,074
(RALPH LAUGHS)

735
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,119
What? I didn't say anything.

736
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,396
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

737
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:02,959
(DIRECTOR) Where is he?

738
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,469
Where the hell is Mr Williams?

739
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,558
I'm late.

740
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,153
I'm late.

741
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,595
Well, come on! Come on, Gilbert!

742
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,196
- Where've you been?
- Anne...

743
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,993
(DIRECTOR) We have to go
straightaway. No rehearsal.

744
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,357
It's clouding over, we're losing
the light. We need to film now.

745
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,799
Mark it, please <i>House of Cheyney,</i>
scene 105, take 1.

746
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,749
(DIRECTOR) Action!

747
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,994
Uncle, I know you said not to take
the job at the big house.

748
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,676
But the master has been so kind
to me, and it is a fine opportunity.

749
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,469
(GILBERT) There will be
other opportunities.

750
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,517
I know you have your eye on him.

751
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,797
But he is engaged to another

752
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,432
and, however much you hope,
that situation will not change.

753
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,273
You should listen to me, Jenny.

754
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,194
(DIRECTOR) Cut! Everyone,
I have an announcement to make.

755
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,592
Apparently...

756
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,034
I'm not quite sure how to put it.

757
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,236
- We're now at war.
- (MURMURING)

758
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,630
We're at war with Germany.

759
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,392
So it's happened.

760
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,757
This news is very shocking,
but we still have a job to do.

761
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,150
I've asked for a wireless to be sent up,

762
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,595
and when it arrives,
we can gather round it,

763
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,988
take an early tea break.

764
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,152
But for now, we'll pick up
from where we were.

765
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,515
Roll up. Action!

766
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,672
- Do you understand, Anne?
- Yes, I think so.

767
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,956
Which bit do you think
I don't understand?

768
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,236
That we're at war,
or what "action" means?

769
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,755
Come on, for God's sake! Action!

770
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,753
- (ANNE) Thank you.
- (CAR DRIVES AWAY)

771
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,554
You're not waiting for me,
are you?

772
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,597
I'm sorry. It was a very long day.

773
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,672
- We've been watching the door.
- Mama's gone to bed early.

774
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,229
But we thought
we should all be together.

775
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,472
We thought today of all days
you might read to us.

than high birth to me,

(OFFICER) Sorry, miss,
this is no place for you.

785
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,871
Come along.

- (GASPS)
- You step outside.

787
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,190
I was just taking him his tea.

788
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,794
I was only a couple of minutes late.

789
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,397
He wasn't in his dressing room.
That's when I found him.

790
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,630
They say it looks like he shot himself...

791
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,473
They said I shouldn't ask but...
that's how it looks.

792
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,915
- Did you see a note?
- I didn't see much.

793
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,550
- So you didn't see a note?
- I couldn't really look at anything.

794
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:34,156
I was only a tiny bit late
and... there he was.

795
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,114
And I can't get through
to them on location.

796
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,794
I've called and called.
His scene is very soon.

797
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,758
It would be terrible
if they were expecting him.

798
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,552
- <i>(WOMAN) Yes?</i>
- Can I speak to Lawrence Newbolt?

799
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,870
<i>Putting you through.</i>

800
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,797
<i>I'm... sorry, I made a mistake.</i>
<i>I was misinformed.</i>

801
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,474
<i>Mr Newbolt is not here.</i>
<i>He's gone to Paris.</i>

802
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,349
To Paris?
But he was in Scotland.

803
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,559
<i>He WAS in Scotland, and now</i>
<i>he's in Paris. He went this morning.</i>

804
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,597
This morning?

805
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,797
- When will he be back?
- <i>That is classified, of course.</i>

(KNOCKING)

808
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,152
I've just seen the dreadful news
in the paper about Mr Williams.

809
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,550
I am so sorry.

810
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,997
- You must be so upset.
- Yes.

811
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,592
It was horrible.
I really was very fond of him.

812
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,512
Does anybody know what happened?

813
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,468
They say he shot himself.
That's what it looks like.

814
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,352
But there wasn't a note.

815
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,714
I waited for hours to see

816
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,075
if they would find a note from him,
a message.

817
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,515
- And they didn't.
- He may not have written one.

818
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,232
It's an extraordinarily
emotional time right now,

819
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,277
for me too.

820
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,395
It seems it was so recent,
the last war,

821
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,596
and having been
there myself, darling,

822
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,513
having fought in that delightful show,

823
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,832
I can tell you
I dream about it nearly every night.

824
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,911
I know a lot of people are very confused.

825
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,471
And I don't want to seem
hysterical or overdramatic...

826
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,553
You're an actress.
Some of that is required.

827
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,191
- (CHUCKLES) Yes, that's true.
- You're so bright and original,

828
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:58,831
full of your stories and drawings,
always, never lost that.

829
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,116
Your comic knights and their adventures.

830
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,636
Yes, and so I don't want it to seem
as though I'm imagining things.

831
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,199
I understand.

832
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,751
And Gilbert may have killed himself.
But what if he didn't?

833
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,034
What if something else is going on?
I mean, first Hector and then him.

834
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,873
Why would they
concern themselves with Gilbert?

835
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,715
It doesn't seem likely, darling,
that they're linked.

836
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,470
- I love you.
- (SIGHS)

837
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,313
No one knows what each day
will bring at the moment,

838
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,152
and that's very disconcerting.

839
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,231
It applies to me as well.

840
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,198
One thing is certain:

841
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:41,114
we won't let Mr Balcombe
anywhere near us,

842
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,589
whatever he's up to.

843
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,194
I will keep you safe.

844
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,309
Some things
I'm still good at, darling.

845
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,634
I just heard the news. It's awful.

846
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,037
It is amazing how much
has changed in a day.

847
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,760
It's incredible,
coming through the park just now

848
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,708
I thought I saw
this huge silver beast.

849
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,108
A silver beast?

850
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,748
It was, in fact, a barrage balloon
being inflated,

851
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,639
but it was moving by itself
along the ground.

852
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,715
And they say two million people
are being evacuated today.

853
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,997
And lots and lots of people
are having their pets put down.

854
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,037
- Their pets?
- Mm.

855
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,760
Really? How awful!

856
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,673
Because they're leaving and
there's nobody to look after them,

857
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,796
or because they feel
it's being responsible.

858
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,669
- I may be going to America.
- To America?

859
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,752
- When are you going?
- Maybe very soon.

860
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,670
Things keeps changing, but at the
moment the government suggests

861
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,957
I should go there and try
and raise funds for the war effort.

862
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,953
Don't worry.
Remember what I said.

863
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,909
So can you go down to Norfolk
to look after Aunt Elizabeth?

864
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,834
She's staying down there.
You know she hates to be alone.

865
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,037
Your mother will join you
when she can. Won't you, darling?

866
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,998
I just need to leave this garden
in the best state I can.

867
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,072
It would be good if you could
go to Norfolk, darling.

868
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:15,119
Yes. They just want me at the studio
for one more day, to do some sound.

869
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,639
Miss Keyes!

870
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,553
These were in your dressing room.

871
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,870
I don't know if you meant
to leave them behind.

872
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,429
I think the cigarette case is Mr Williams'...

873
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,636
but I didn't know who else to give it to.

874
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,910
I didn't see this
in my dressing room.

875
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,991
It was in a cupboard right at the back.

876
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,116
It will be a shock seeing him again, Anne.

877
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,633
You'll find it distressing

878
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,792
seeing Mr Williams
springing back to life, so to speak.

879
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,032
Yes, of course it's strange...
so soon after.

880
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,919
Yes, that's why I thought
we'd get it out of the way,

881
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,595
get it done while we still can.
Who knows where we'll be next week?

882
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,116

again. There was some noise on it.

take the job at the big house...

up there, Anne, don't you think?

I know you have...

887

(DIRECTOR) Gilbert is a bit
detached, isn't he? You can see it.

888
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,836
He wasn't quite there.

889
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,878
Obviously already decided
what he was going to do.

890

Uncle, I know you think

891
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,553
I shouldn't have taken the job...

892
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,952
Is that?
That was a bit off, I'm afraid.

893
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,988
Maybe you should watch
the whole scene, get in the mood.

894
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,230
Perhaps we should have done that first.

that situation will not change.

899

You should listen to it again, Anne.

What... What the hell is he doing?

He called you Anne instead of Jenny
and totally rewrote the line.

1074
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,752
Thank God you're here!

1075
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,957
Papa got a call from these soldiers
saying you'd been detained!

1076
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,236
They called the Houses of Parliament.

1077
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:09,198
Aunt Elizabeth telephoned to say
you rushed out coughing

1078
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,158
like you were about to die
in the middle of choir practice.

1079
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,993
The vicar was heartbroken.
Why did you do that, Glorious?

1080
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,512
I had to... get away.

1081
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,554
I've got a bit of a confession to make.

1082
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,234
Although it won't come
as a great surprise.

1083
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,510
I'm terribly in love.

1084
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,552
I'm so in love with Lawrence,

1085
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,156
I couldn't bear to be away from him,
shut away in the country.

1086
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:39,709
I had this incredible urge to see him.

1087
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,509
How wonderful, darling! That's fantastic!

1088
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,274
That is pretty romantic, Glorious, yes.

1089
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,000
There's a party tonight
at the Foreign Office,

1090
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,230
and we've helped arrange it.

1091
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,551
(RALPH) Nothing can stop the parties
happening, especially not this one.

1092
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,789
It's all the ambassadors.

1093
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:00,351
Lawrence is going to be there too.
Isn't that good timing?

1094
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:01,669
He is?

1095
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,115
Now you've been detained,
you've got to come.

1096
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:08,910
(RALPH) Dawson will drive your car
back to Aunt Elizabeth.

1097
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,911
I thought it was dangerous to drive.

1098
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,516
Apparently it is! That's why you
shouldn't be driving it.

1099
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,750
But Dawson's expendable, isn't he!

1100
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,275
Lots more where you came from,
aren't there!

1101
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:23,432
I get to drive the Rolls,
which is terrific. Come on, Glorious.

1102
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,592
We're hosts to tonight's party,
remember. Lots to do!

1103
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,990
Yes, including a hot bath for you, darling.

1104
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,071
You look a real country girl like that!

1105
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,631
You've time to have a really good
wallow before you see him.

1106
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,276
You see, everything's gone now.
It's all in storage.

1107
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:50,479
And with the whole town blacked out,
isn't it strange, darling?

1108
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,677
Like being in another place
completely.

1109
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,432
On the moon or something!

1110
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,511
- You look so lovely.
- Why, thank you!

1111
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:03,079
I am the hostess
of this party, in a way,

1112
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,878
so I'm just a tiny bit nervous.

1113
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,632
It's part of my new job.

1114
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,234
I am attached
to the Court of St James now!

1115
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,197
I am going to need to go a little early.

1116
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,749
That's fine. I'll escort Anne.
We'll go together.

1117
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,869
All right. I must volunteer too.

1118
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,678
I have to do something for the war effort.

1119
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,434
Glorious, you don't have to do that.
You're an actress.

1120
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:27,628
- That's what you keep doing.
- Ah! But talking of volunteering...

1121
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,428
A lot of our childhood things
down here...

1122
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,640
I'm not sure
what's going to happen to them.

1123
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,557
(CAT MEOWS)

1124
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,676
Do you recognise him?
It's Bombardier.

1125
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,832
Oh, yes, of course.
Aunt Elizabeth's cat.

1126
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,639
So, darling, this is a little bit nasty,

1127
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,756
but Aunt Elizabeth wants him put down

1128
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,478
because she's left London.

1129
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,153
I was going to take him to the vet,

1130
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,436
but now you're here, could you do it?

1131
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,437
I'm needed at work, you see.

1132
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,876
And I can't ask
one of the servants to do it.

1133
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,749
And I would be so upset
taking him anyway!

1134
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,117
- Will you do it?
- If that's what has to be done.

1135
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,839
You look so good, Glorious.

1136
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:26,835
Here you are! So far, no disasters.

1137
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,468
They haven't started throwing things?
Give them time!

1138
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,632
Argentina has been extremely
talkative. And America.

1139
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,997
Mr Kennedy goes on about how much
stronger Germany is than we are

1140
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,630
and how everything is over for us
and we'd better realise it! (GIGGLES)

1141
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,509
Darling, you must go downstairs
to the other party.

1142
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,079
That's altogether more fun.

1143
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,159
(ALEXANDER) Now, I have
a series of flags here,

1144
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,958
these little flags,

1145
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,271
and somewhere on the map
of the world over here

1146
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,715
- is some treasure!
- (CHILDREN GASP)

1147
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,758
So you stick your flag
wherever you think the treasure is,

1148
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,037
and whoever is the nearest
will get a rather marvellous prize!

1149
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,156
(GASPING AND LAUGHTER)

1150
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,311
So come on, everybody, take a flag.

1151
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,152
(EXCITED SHOUTING)

1152
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,833
Darling! There you are!

1153
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,069
- It's terrific to see you.
- You're not angry with me?

1154
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,993
- For leaving Norfolk?
- Of course not. I understand.

1155
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,799
Would you take this,
and organise the treasure hunt?

1156
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:39,235
Children, Ralph here
will now be in charge!

1157
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,392
Gladly. Just don't forget to
tell me where the treasure is.

1158
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,233
It's all the children
of the ambassadors in London.

1159
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,029
They don't know whether they'll be
travelling back to their countries.

1160
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,634
- They don't know what's happening.
- A bit like us.

1161
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,712
A bit like us, yes.

1162
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,919
I should never have sent you
to the country with Aunt Elizabeth.

1163
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:02,868
How could I have done that?
You belong here, with all of us.

1164
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,678
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- Fantastic.

1165
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:08,958
Now you must go
and get yourself some jelly.

1166
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,439
Some jelly? Why?

1167
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,592
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1168
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,878
(ANNE GASPS)

1169
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,996
- Oh, Lawrence!
- Hello, darling.

1170
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,233
Oh, I didn't know
whether I'd ever see you again.

1171
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,630
I didn't know
whether you'd really be here.

1172
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,109
Yes, they suddenly
sent me to France. Don't cry.

1173
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,475
I am not cry... I'm not crying.

1174
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,474
It's just, for a moment,
everything seemed all right,

1175
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,993
and I know it isn't.

1176
01:19:40,160 --> 01:19:42,594
Now then, when we've got
all our flags pinned up,

1177
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,955
I think we should have
a bit of a sing-song.

1178
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,429
What about a song
from each of your countries?

1179
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,034
- Everybody like the sound of that?
- (ALL) Yes!

1180
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:54,193
- Something terrible is going on.
- I know.

1181
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,396
- Ralph is involved.
- I know that too.

1182
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,549
You know?

1183
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,757
Do you think he realises the
full extent of what they're doing?

1184
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,150
- Maybe he doesn't.
- I don't know the answer.

1185
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,676
He's my brother.
I can't believe he would...

1186
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,032
I want to believe he couldn't.

1187
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,431
What I've found out is that there's
a group of them in the secret service

1188
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,194
and a motley collection of other people,

1189
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,669
including some
very determined aristocrats

1190
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,150
who are trying to bring this war
to an end before it's even started.

1191
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,278
They think we have no chance.
They want to do a deal with Hitler.

1192
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,396
I think they killed my friend Gilbert.

1193
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,597
- And they blackmailed Hector...
- They are very dangerous.

They drove Hector to kill himself,

- I've got a recording of a meeting.
- Can you give it to me?

1198
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,835
I don't have it here.

1199
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,390
I really have to have it.
Proof is invaluable.

1200
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:55,879
I must get it tomorrow.

1201
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,838
We'll meet in the morning,
Somewhere I won't be followed.

We could meet there.

- Yes, that sounds rather perfect.
- (FOOTSTEPS)

- It's all right. We are in love.
- Are we?

That's what I told him, and
that's what he's going to see.

1209
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,912
Not in front of the children,
Glorious! Come along.

1210
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,117
If we're to use your idea,
I'd better get the address of a vet.

1211
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:53,236
We can't use one that's near the house.

1212
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,676
It has to be out of the way,
in the suburbs. You understand?

1213
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,957
I'll do that now, use
the great resources of the building.

01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:33,311
Follow me. It's important.
I think you should come as well.

1223
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,713
It's such a big basement.
Where are we going?

1224
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,677
You've only seen a corner of it.

1225
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,071
(SOUND OF TYPING)

1226
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,711
Right. Come on in. This is Miss Semel.

1227
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,316
- She's working late.
- She is.

1228
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,632
Now, we have two things
for you, Anne.

1229
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,870
- Your identity card...
- That was quick.

1230
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:09,918
Splendid. I asked Ralph
to arrange it, and that is quick.

1231
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,436
Rather a long walk to get to it, though.

1232
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,036
That's perfect. You have your card.
You're officially you.

1233
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,754
I'd better get back to
the ambassadors, darling.

1234
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,195
I've spent too much time
with the children.

1235
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,590
They're so much more interesting (!)

1236
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,752
- I'll come with you.
- Just a moment.

1237
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,070
- What is it?
- Why are you running away?

1238
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,755
I'm not running away.
Why would I do that?

1239
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,274
I don't know.

1240
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:43,952
I found out the other thing,
the one we talked about.

1241
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,556
It seems a rather appropriate moment
to do it, to go with the card.

1242
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:49,392
If you want.

1243
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,118
You mean about my parents?

1244
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,469
Do you want to hear,
or do you want to run off?

1245
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,240
All right. Why not?

1246
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,590
- Good night, Miss Semel.
- Good night.

1247
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,990
I think you'll be pleased.

1248
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,798
It explains your theatrical bent -
well, I think it does.

1249
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,834
They were a Romany family.

1250
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,070
Your parents were gypsies.

1251
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,596
There are no pictures, sadly.

1252
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,832
One of them
must've been blonde, mustn't they?

1253
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,197
Maybe they had Russian blood.

1254
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:38,433
Thank you.
You're right. I do like the idea.

1255
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,955
I see nothing wrong
in coming from gypsies.

1256
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,277
I think I'll go back to the party now.

1257
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:03,632
Hello?

1258

1259

How are you here?
You were in church this morning!

1260
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:20,791
YOU'RE here,
and YOU were in the church.

1261
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,109
Why are you here?

1262
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,874
I didn't realise you were
the son of an ambassador.

1263
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,600
They thought I might be able
to contribute to the party.

1264
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,150
I'm sure you will be. Excuse me.

1265
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,439
Anne!

1266
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:42,113
- Don't you realise?
- Don't I realise what?

1270
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:14,154
- Here, have some more.
- Oh, thank you.

1271
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,797
I have an address for you.

1272
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,191
- You can find out anything here.
- I've just discovered that.

1273
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,955
We'll meet there. Put the evidence
you have into an envelope,

1274
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:28,680
and address it
to someone other than me.

- Doesn't matter. Winston Churchill.

1277
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,035
- Will they follow me there?
- No.

1278
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,395
Keep an eye out, but I don't think so.

1279
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:42,030
They won't follow you into the vet.
They're far too squeamish.

1280
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,474
There you are, darling.

1281
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,870
I'm off to take Bombardier
to the vet for...

1282
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,589
- Well, you know what for.
- Yes. What things have come to.

1283
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,274
There may be lot of people there,
so I could be a while.

1284
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,716
Anne, if it's not too much to ask,

1285
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,429
I think you should take Horatio too.
He needs to be done as well.

1286
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:02,828
Take our cat? Why?

1287
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,515
If I'm going to the US next week,
we'll be shutting up the house.

1288
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:11,389
I'll take Bombardier
because Aunt Elizabeth

1289
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,073
has asked for that to happen.

1290
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,117
I'll find another home for Horatio.

1291
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,874
- I'm sure I can.
- No, darling, we can't do that.

1292
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,600
A lot of other people
are having to do this.

1293
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,990
They can be told
it's not necessary yet.

1294

I find myself having to tell them
that it is.

1295
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:32,078
Anyway, we'll get Dawson
to see to it. Don't worry yourself.

Come and sit with me
and help me. I need your help.

No, I'm the only one who's not
doing anything at the moment,

1298
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,514
so I should do it,
if that's what's required.

1299
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,591
I will take the cats to be put to sleep,

1300
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,432
then I will come back and help you.

There's no school any more.

evacuated, so they're running wild.

let anything happen to you.
