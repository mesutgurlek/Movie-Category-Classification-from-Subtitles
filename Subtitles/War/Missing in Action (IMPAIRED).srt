Uh, Colonel Braddock, there is a
question I've been wanting to ask you.

201
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,487
Is it true that you let
ten of your men die in prison

202
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:29,200
all because you alone refused
to admit your war crimes?

at the request of the President

211

any more Braddocks in Vietnam.

are made out of.

01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:30,328
- Do we run or fight?
- We don't have a choice now.

488
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:24,632
The camp is about one klick
north of here.

489
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:27,052
I'll go the rest of the way on foot.

- You are after the Americans?
- Yeah. Where are they?

512
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:52,551
They moved less than three hours ago,
somewhere further inland.

513
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,303
Do you know which road they took?

514
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:57,890
There is only one road
that connects with Highway One.

515
01:22:58,057 --> 01:23:00,184
It follows the river all the way.
