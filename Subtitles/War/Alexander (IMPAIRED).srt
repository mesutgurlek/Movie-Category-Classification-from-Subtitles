...Greece could rule the world.

160
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:04,654
Why is it, master, in myth,
these lands you speak of are known?

161
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:11,119
India, where Herakles
and Dionysus traveled.

162
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:16,541
All these men who went east, Theseus,
Jason, Achilles, were victorious.

163
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,795
From generation to generation,
their stories have been passed on.

164
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,548
Why? Unless there was truth to them?

165
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,469
Tales of Amazons? No, Alexander.

166
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:31,473
Only common people believe these tales,
as they believe most anything.

167
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,269
We are here precisely to educate
ourselves against such foolish passions.

168
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:42,651
But if we are superior to the Persians,
as you say, why do we not rule them?

169
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:48,198
It is-- It has always been
our Greek dream to go east.

170
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,371
The East has a way of swallowing
men and their dreams.

171
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,707
ARISTARCHUS:
Master?

172
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,125
- Master?
- Yes?

173
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,627
- Master!
- Out with it!

174
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,713
- Why are the Persians so cruel?
BOY: Oh, come on, Aristarchus.

175
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,174
That is not the subject for today,
Aristarchus.

176
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:10,971
But it is true that the Oriental races
are known for their barbarity...

177
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,974
...and their slavish devotion
to their senses.

178
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,978
Excess in all things
is the undoing of men.

179
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,730
That is why we Greeks are superior.

180
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,483
We practice control of our senses.

181
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,027
Moderation, we hope.

182
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,571
CASSANDRA:
And what of Achilles at Troy, master?

183
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:33,702
- Was he not excessive?
- Achilles simply lacks restraint.

184
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,872
He dominates others so completely that
even when he withdraws from battle...

185
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,251
...crazed with grief over
his dead lover, Patrols...

186
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:46,339
...he seriously endangers his own army.
He is a deeply selfish man.

187
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,427
Would you say the love between Achilles
and Patrols is a corrupting one?

188
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,098
When men lie together in lust,
it is a surrender to the passions...

189
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:59,102
...and does nothing
for the excellence in us.

190
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:03,690
Nor does any other excess, Cassandra,
jealousy among them.

191
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,942
But when men lie together...

192
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,279
...and knowledge and virtue
are passed between them...

When they compete to bring out
the good, the best in each other...

Some say these Alexandria have become
extensions of Alexander himself.

They draw people into the cities

But we freed them, Sophistication, from

02:45:44,769 --> 02:45:50,191
You shall write, "He died of fever
and a weakened condition."

1876
02:45:50,983 --> 02:45:52,818
Yes, great Pharaoh.

1877
02:45:52,985 --> 02:45:56,906
Oh, he could've stayed home
in Macedonia, married, raised a family.

1878
02:45:58,115 --> 02:46:01,202
He'd have died a celebrated man.

1879
02:46:03,579 --> 02:46:06,332
But this was not Alexander.

1880
02:46:06,707 --> 02:46:12,588
All his life,
he fought to free himself from fear.

1881
02:46:12,755 --> 02:46:18,928
And by this, and this alone,
he was made free.

1882
02:46:20,304 --> 02:46:24,266
The freest man I've ever known.

1883
02:46:25,935 --> 02:46:30,940
His tragedy was one
of increasing loneliness...

1884
02:46:31,107 --> 02:46:34,860
...and impatience with those
who could not understand.

1885
02:46:35,236 --> 02:46:37,863
And if his desire...

1886
02:46:38,030 --> 02:46:42,952
...to reconcile Greek and barbarian
ended in failure...

1887
02:46:45,496 --> 02:46:48,624
What failure!

1888
02:46:48,874 --> 02:46:55,047
His failure towered
over other men's successes.

1889
02:46:59,760 --> 02:47:01,470
I've lived--

1890
02:47:01,679 --> 02:47:04,056
I've lived long life, Cad mos...

1891
02:47:04,265 --> 02:47:06,559
...but the glory
and the memory of man...

1892
02:47:06,767 --> 02:47:11,689
...will always belong to the ones
who follow their great visions.

1893
02:47:12,148 --> 02:47:17,403
And the greatest of these
is the one they now call...

1894
02:47:18,571 --> 02:47:22,491
...Megas Alexandros.

1895
02:47:23,909 --> 02:47:27,163
The greatest Alexander of them all.

1896
02:55:37,861 --> 02:55:39,863
