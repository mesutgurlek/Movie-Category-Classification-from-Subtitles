I fell asleep.

TINO: Big deal.

00:44:29,966 --> 00:44:31,333
Yeah, okay.

Hey, what's up?

467
00:45:17,546 --> 00:45:19,381
Did you wake them up?

468
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,418
No. Not yet.

469
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:28,523
Okay, I'll do it then.

So, Davies and Wardell
say they didn't hear
anything on watch,

00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:55,920
which leaves you two.

I assume you would
have woken us up had
you heard anything.

JEFF: What do you mean?

492
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:01,192
MARCUS: What I mean is this.

493
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,496
The ignition system,
it's been completely torn out.

Fuck, as in we are fucked.

Can we fix it?

498
00:48:11,404 --> 00:48:13,905
That seems to be
a negative at the moment.

499
00:48:13,973 --> 00:48:18,243
But I contacted Charlie
and was able to apprise
them of our situation.

GREGORY: Wait,
the SatCom's working?

501
00:48:19,746 --> 00:48:22,614
Correct. I received
a communication this morning.

502
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:27,085
And, according to Parker,
some vehicles went by us
last night.

503
00:48:27,152 --> 00:48:29,153
They intercepted them
on their end.

504
00:48:29,221 --> 00:48:32,891
But they seem to have gone
right by us, so you know
what that means?

505
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:35,460
Ali Baba drove
right the fuck by,

506
00:48:35,528 --> 00:48:37,496
ass-fucked us, and we
slept right through it,

507
00:48:37,563 --> 00:48:41,232
despite having two people
on watch all night.

508
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,135
Are you saying that
cars drove by us and
we didn't even notice?

509
00:48:44,203 --> 00:48:46,204
MARCUS: That's right.
- Staff Sergeant,
don't you think it's likely

510
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:47,305
we're just in
the wrong place?

511
00:48:47,373 --> 00:48:49,073
We are not in
the wrong place.

512
00:48:49,141 --> 00:48:52,043
We are exactly where
we're supposed to be,
which is where they left us.

513
00:48:52,111 --> 00:48:55,113
So from now on, one person
is outside at all times.

514
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,949
You will walk out
as far as you can,
in three separate directions

in your sights.

516

You want us to stand out
in the desert all day?

517
00:49:01,854 --> 00:49:03,488
You can't ask us to do that.

to do a goddamn thing,

519
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:09,127
It's a direct fucking order,
and you will carry it out.

520
00:49:09,194 --> 00:49:10,495
Now move!

521
00:49:13,666 --> 00:49:14,833

00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:44,849

Yeah?

Whoever did that

530
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:52,624
has got to be somewhere nearby
to know we're here, right?

531
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:56,761
Maybe they're hiding
somewhere in the desert,

532
00:51:56,829 --> 00:52:00,164
and here we are,
separated into teams.

533
00:52:00,232 --> 00:52:01,499
Somebody could be
watching us,

534
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:04,035
and we wouldn't even
fucking know it.

it had to be that

she busted into our

Get out here!

618
01:01:02,007 --> 01:01:03,841
Trev.
CHARD: Hey!

619
01:01:19,424 --> 01:01:21,826
TREVOR: Shit.

620
01:01:21,894 --> 01:01:23,828
Could, like, animals have
gotten them or something?

621
01:01:23,896 --> 01:01:25,997
JEFF: No, and
there's no tracks.

622
01:01:26,064 --> 01:01:27,932
TREVOR: This shit ain't right.

623
01:01:30,769 --> 01:01:32,236
Where is she?

624
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,341
MARCUS: Hey.

625
01:01:37,409 --> 01:01:38,642
JEFF: She was asleep.
She's not doing anything.
What's the big deal?

626
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:40,744
I gave you one goddamn order,

627
01:01:40,813 --> 01:01:43,915
do not leave her alone.
What the fuck do you do?

628
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:48,252
Outside, both of you.
Get your gear.

629
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,922
What the fuck you
looking at him for?

630

MARCUS: Davies.

631
01:02:10,843 --> 01:02:12,877
Get inside and
look after the girl.

632
01:02:12,944 --> 01:02:14,612
Hey, I'm just trying
to find what happened...

633
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,114
Later. Inside. Now.

01:02:22,954 --> 01:02:24,221
Sit down.

635
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:43,073
Now,

636
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:44,776
I'll sit out here

637
01:02:46,311 --> 01:02:48,646
where I can
keep an eye on you.

638
01:02:50,248 --> 01:02:51,416
What are you talking about?

639
01:02:51,483 --> 01:02:53,718
I'm talking about our
goddamn mission, Keller,

640
01:02:53,786 --> 01:02:56,487
which is to sit outside
this house and look out
for the enemy,

641
01:02:56,555 --> 01:02:57,889
and that's exactly
what we're going to do.

642
01:02:57,956 --> 01:03:00,190
The three of us right here
where I can see you

643
01:03:00,258 --> 01:03:02,794
and nobody else
can sneak up on us.

644
01:03:02,861 --> 01:03:04,061
Okay.

645
01:03:06,331 --> 01:03:08,533
Anderson,

646
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:12,904
that's the last time you
say anything other than,
"Yes, Staff Sergeant" to me.

647
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:36,594
Staff Sergeant,
you've proven your point.

648
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:39,864
Whatever it is.

649
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:42,767
Can we please go inside
and get some water?

650
01:03:42,835 --> 01:03:46,537
In a minute. We'll all
get water together.

651
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:53,744
Come on, Keller.
This heat ain't shit.

652
01:03:53,812 --> 01:03:55,813
I know you ain't no punk.

653

655
01:04:02,387 --> 01:04:03,387
I thought this shit
was basic training.

656
01:04:03,455 --> 01:04:04,622
He's fucking insane.

657
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:05,957
It's a miracle you got
through boot camp, boys.

658
01:04:06,024 --> 01:04:07,257
No shit.

659

What the fuck do you
want us to do about it?

660

What's the penalty for mutiny?

You asked him what,
motherfucker? What the
fuck did you just say?

666
01:04:23,241 --> 01:04:26,577
I was asking Jeff
if he knew how the
Vikings was doing

667
01:04:26,645 --> 01:04:28,278
'cause they were
supposed to play
against St. Louis...

She wanted me to.

Hey, I called you nimrod.
Look, I say,
"You fucking nimrod."

775
01:13:16,374 --> 01:13:19,743
I don't know.
But I'm gonna go get her.

776
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:23,080
Be careful.
She could be trying
to signal somebody.

777
01:13:24,883 --> 01:13:26,283
Yeah, right.

778
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:25,325
Wilcox?

779
01:14:26,594 --> 01:14:28,729
Anderson. Don't shoot, man.

780
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:31,531
Do you have a weapon?
Show me your hands.

781
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:34,668
I don't have a gun.

782
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,469
Keep your hands up.

783
01:14:37,338 --> 01:14:38,438
Okay.

784
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,341
Gregory,

785
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:44,011
you're dead, man.

786
01:14:44,946 --> 01:14:46,613
I saw your corpse.

787
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,017
Yeah.

788
01:14:53,054 --> 01:14:54,855

Just two of you
motherfuckers left now.

791
01:15:56,101 --> 01:15:57,868
Real fucking clever.

JEFF: Hands up!

794
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,534
Put your hands on your head.

Down.

797
01:17:18,316 --> 01:17:20,417
Get the fuck down.

798
01:17:22,487 --> 01:17:26,189
All right. I'm not
sure what's going on,

799
01:17:26,257 --> 01:17:28,692
but I'm gonna
tie you up again

800
01:17:29,594 --> 01:17:32,529
and then I'm gonna...

806
01:21:49,937 --> 01:21:51,204
Specialist Keller,
I understand

807
01:21:51,272 --> 01:21:52,773
you were less than
fully forthcoming

808
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,808
during your debriefing.

809
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:58,578
Let's see if we can't
refresh your memory.

810
01:21:58,646 --> 01:22:00,013
I'm going to lay out
our version of the facts

811
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:03,750
and you tell me if I'm getting
it right or wrong. Got that?

812
01:22:05,653 --> 01:22:06,853
Okay.

813
01:22:08,389 --> 01:22:10,157
Your squad was
stationed on a patrol

814
01:22:10,224 --> 01:22:14,560
during which time
your communications
systems went down.

815
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:19,166
Shortly thereafter, you
were attacked by a group
of al-Qaeda fighters,

816
01:22:19,233 --> 01:22:21,567
about 30 of them.

817
01:22:21,635 --> 01:22:25,238
More? 40?
What the hell, let's say 50.

818
01:22:25,306 --> 01:22:30,143
So, this faction of 50
or so al-Qaeda militants

819
01:22:31,345 --> 01:22:33,646
easily outnumbered your squad.

820
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:38,785
Your staff sergeant
was killed,

821
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:41,754
as were all the other
members of your squad.

822
01:22:43,657 --> 01:22:47,828
But you somehow survived by...

823
01:22:50,998 --> 01:22:53,033
I was knocked unconscious.

824
01:22:54,368 --> 01:22:57,570
You were knocked unconscious.
Yes.

825
01:22:57,638 --> 01:23:00,273
Knocked unconscious
and left for dead.

826
01:23:00,975 --> 01:23:03,176
A hero, really.

827
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:07,047
Now, under the circumstances,
I think we can
take care of you.

828
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:11,218
All right, you sit tight.
I'll get Hollister in here

829
01:23:11,285 --> 01:23:15,722
to take care of the paperwork,
and all that's left is
to get you on a plane.

830
01:23:15,789 --> 01:23:19,459
With any luck, you'll
be on American soil
day after tomorrow.

831
