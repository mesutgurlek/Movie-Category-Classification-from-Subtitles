137
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:48,073

    Negative on air support.

138
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,874
     Maintain radio silence
          now forward.

139
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,776
        3-6 Actual. Out.

140
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,645
           Copy that,
         Almighty. Out!

141
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,914

00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,148
             Freddy.

143
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,685
      All right, listen up!

144
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,521
         We have to move
    to rally point two ASAP.

145
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,124
       When we get there,
      we're gonna stay put

146
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,727
          and maintain
         radio silence.

147
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,261
       You speak English?
             - I do.

148
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,429
        What's your name?

149
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,231
        Sister Claudette.
            - Sister?

150
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,200
          Are you hurt,
        Sister Claudette?

151
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,035
       No, where do we go?

152
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,738
    We're going to a military
    rally point, where you'll
          be relocated.

153
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,606
       You're safe as long
       as you're with us.

154
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:22,674
        I must get back!

155
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:23,975
       Calm down, Sister.

156
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,010
           [ gunfire ]
         Hey, get down!

157
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,612
     Watch the fire, Griff!

158
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,520
    DAWSON: Sommers, we don't
      have that much time.

159
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:38,356
        30 more seconds,
             Sarge!

160
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,894
          The children,
          they need me!

161
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,429
            Children?
         What children?

162
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,198
       I run an orphanage
     with Mother Mary Ellen.

163
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,233
             There--
     There are many orphans!

164
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,367
       They must be saved!

165
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,908
         I--I live with
          the children.

166
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,043
         Kids? What kind
        of nun has kids?

167
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:01,780
      Nuns run orphanages,
          you dumb-ass!

168
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,015
          Orphans, yes!
           I must go!

169
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,250
            Hey! Hey!
        You can't make it

170
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,552
      back to the orphanage
          by yourself!

171
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,654
        I don't know how
     you got this far alone.

172
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,656
              I had
       an American escort.

173
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,758
        American escort?

174
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:17,362
       They were executed
         by the Germans.

175
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,264
    Freddy, give me the map!

176
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,440
   Watch--Keep your head down!

177
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,009
              Hey.

178
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,380
           We're here.

179
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,614
     Where's your orphanage?

180
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:37,682
              Uh...

181
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,184
              Here?

182
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,085
              Rose,
    that's three clicks east.

183
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,288
          Rally point's
       five clicks north!

184
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,390
      Almost there, Sarge!

185
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:50,028
   We don't have a lot of time
   to get to that rally point.

186
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,229
           [ ticking ]

187
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,931
          We're already
           a kilometer
           off-course.

188
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,233
       Three clicks east,
    pick up a bunch of kids,

189
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,135
         then hike back
            to here,

190
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,603
          plus another
       five clicks north,

191
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,505
        and that's pretty
      shaky ground, Sarge.

192
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,841
        Rose, what if we
       go straight there?

193
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,143
        Well, we got a--
      a chance of making it

194
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,845
       to the rally point
     before the bombs fall.

195
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,179
             Chance?
      What kind of chance?

196
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,582
           A slim one!
           But it's--

197
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:12,317
           it's better
         than the chance

198
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,051
      that those kids have
        making it through
         the operation.

199
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,623
          One more can!
          One more can,
             Sarge!

200
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:19,624
          One more can!

201
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,793
        We can't risk it.

202
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,262
       I'm sorry, Sister.
              - No!

203
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,964
          Sarge, Sarge,
          I don't think
          you heard me.

204
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:28,032
           I heard you
      just fine, Sergeant.

205
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,768
      I said a slim chance,
         you know, but--

206
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,370
    Yeah, I'm aware of that,
            Sergeant!

207
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,874
        Well, holy shit!
       I'm with the Sarge
          on this one!

208
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,375
            What did
           your father
       used to always say?

209
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,910
      If you're gonna die,
        you might as well

210
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,144
       go ahead and die...

211
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:42,046
     Doing the right thing,
              yeah.

212
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,848
         And in my eyes,
    this is the right thing.

213
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,783
            I usually
         back your play,
        but look at her!

214
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:48,453
     This is not a damn vote
  at the Rotary Club, Sergeant!

215
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,955
       What you're saying
    could get us all killed,
         kids included!

216

         GRIFFIN: I say
        we get the kids!

217
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,392
        At least give 'em
       a chance to make it
     through the operation.

218
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,964
         Look, they may
        not be our kids,

219
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,432
           but they're
         someone's kids.

220
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,535
           All right,
           that's it!

221
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,137

       to the rally point.

         be kidding me!

        Am I the only one
     thinking straight here?

232
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,384
          Look, I feel
       for those orphans,

233
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,553
      I really do, but you
        said it yourself.

234
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,156
         We barely stand
      a chance of making it
        in one piece now.

235
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,626
         I don't see how
      having these kids die
     with us is gonna help.

236
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,528
        Now, look, Sarge,
       I know that you got
      a lot on your plate--

00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,201
          Hey, we'll be
           able to hit

240
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,235
         a few of these
         rough shortcuts

241
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,237
            you can't
        navigate through,
           all right?

242
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,541
     We pick up those kids,
      we'll come out here.

243
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:20,578
          That's right
        along the route.
        Give us one hour.

244
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,081

       you keep this beast
             moving,

245
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,816
       and you don't stop
        till you hit that
          rally point.

246
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,651
      I'm not leaving you,

259
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:32,083

           on the job!
          You read me?

1182
01:22:27,843 --> 01:22:30,210
        Are you giving me
      orders now, Private?

     You stay alive, Sarge,

1185
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:36,383
         I'll sign those
  court-martial papers myself.

1186
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:37,785
              Okay.

      Thanks for saving us
           back there.

1192
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:13,253
       What time you got?

1193
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:16,357
         Doesn't matter.
