Thank you.

00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:59,754
Good afternoon.  
Do you have a reservation for me?

4
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:06,048
My name is Shade.

5
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:21,464
Thank you, sir.

6
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:33,204
Hello?

7
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,764
-Yes?
-(over phone) There is no reply from Miss Tozer's room.

8
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:42,765
I see.

9
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:50,422
-(over phone) May I help you?
-No, I'll, uh, I'll find her later. Thank you.

-Excuse me.
-Yes?

13
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:41,833
-I'm looking for Miss Eve Tozer.
-Oh, uh, try over there.

14
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:43,651
Thank you.

15
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:49,494
The only explanation I could think he's a married man.
And I kept saying, "Darling, I can't possibly accept this.  I just can't"

16
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:51,938
-He wouldn't take "no" for an answer.  He wouldn't take--
-Excuse me.

00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:56,614
(Screams)
Ah, Charlie Shade!

18
00:04:56,615 --> 00:05:00,739
What a surprise!  How the hell are you?

19
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,894
-Could I have a word with you for a moment?

20
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:07,571
Uh, yes.
Sure. Excuse me, just for a minute.

21
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,492
Now... what is going on?

22
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:14,567
It has to be something, to get you out of that cubby hole in London.

23
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:23,543
-Where is your father?

24
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:27,056
-He hasn't written me in over three years.

25
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:31,522
The last I heard, he was on a retreat or something
in Afghanistan.  Why?

26
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:36,923
-Bentik, has influenced a judge in London
to declare your father dead

27
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:41,781
-What?!
-Now, I got a three week stay

28
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:46,205
but there are only 12 days left.
If Bradley Tozer does not appear

29
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:49,378
within a British court, within that time.
You will lose everything.

30
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,292
-But, why?!

31
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:55,870
-The original agreement between
Bentik and your father stated that

32
00:05:55,871 --> 00:06:00,704
in the event of death, the company's
assets would revert to the surviving partner

33
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:03,481
-That's ridiculous!
-Shhh.
-Charlie!

34
00:06:03,482 --> 00:06:06,301
Daddy never would have done
anything like that to me.

35
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:11,631
-The agreement was drawn up
before you were born.

36
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:17,260
-How am I going to live without money?

37
00:06:17,261 --> 00:06:23,358
-Well, you could sell your jewelry. You
could live happily for the rest of your life.
-Oh, Charlie, you know the way I spend money,
it wouldn't last me a year.

38
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:27,572
Well, we just have to find him
and get him back to London, don't we?

39
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:30,923
12 days?
-Yes.

40
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:35,708
-Stay right here. Don't move.

41
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:36,709
Which one of you

42
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,710
would like the honor

43
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:43,013
of loaning me an airplane?

44
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:46,577
-The RAF would be delighted to
lend you an aircraft, Miss Tozer.

[Kissing sound]
I'll have it back in two weeks.

46
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:52,598
-Oh, wait a minute! I thought
you meant just for the night.

47
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:55,290
Terribly sorry.

48
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:59,229
-Anyone else?

49
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,633
No champions?

50
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:10,398
So long, boys.

51
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:17,975
-Can I see you for a minute?
-Excuse me, Charlie.

52
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:19,724
Alright, Lina, what have you got?

53
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:20,725
-Well... you've got to promise me

54
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:24,585
not to say a word to anyone,
especially my husband.

55
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:27,554
-Lina, darling, you know
you can trust me.

56
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:29,206
-Promise?
-On my honor.

57
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,706
-'Fraid that's not good enough.

58
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:34,247
-I promise.
-Okay.

59
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:37,122
Two miles northeast of town
on the Zheng Paul road

60
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,183
you'll find an airfield.
Ask for O'Malley.

61
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:42,548
Some kind of war hero.

62
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,748
Anyway, now he gives
flying lessons.

63
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:47,454
-Is that what you call it, dear?

64
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,514
-You promised, remember?
-My lips are sealed. Thank you.

65
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:53,325
-If it's really urgent, you'll find him

66
00:07:53,326 --> 00:07:56,263
every night, at the Blue Nile club.
Can't miss him.

67
00:07:56,264 --> 00:08:00,294
Dark hair, dark eyes.
About 6'4".

68

-Sounds big.
-Yes, he's big.

-Come on, O'Malley. Come on, boy.
That a boy.

70
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:11,569
That's it.
Put the arm around me.

71
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,877
Walk.  Walk, one foot.

72
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:17,777
That's it.
The other foot.

73
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:20,279
Ah, look, he's walking.

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,025
-Did I drink too much, Struts?
-No, no.

-Let's get another drink.
-We're broke O'Malley.

-Oh, I hurt your suit.

is just around the corner.

I really think you should reconsider.

Surely we can find someone else,
besides this... person.

And, I don't see that we have any choice.

-Ten thousand pounds.

not a pilot.

-He'll go along.

Now. This, is for the flying lesson.

want to go there for?

157
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:39,271
-I am looking for my father, Mr. O'Malley.
He was headed in that direction
when he disappeared.

158
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:43,434
-Ohh, you're crazy.  Go hire yourself a
couple of camels, I wanna drink.

159
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:47,148
-Don't blow it, O'Malley. Don't blow it!
-Blow what? The dame's nuts.

160

-She may be nuts, but she's rich.

-It could be very dangerous up there.
-Charlie.

Mr. O'Malley.

163
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,126
Mr. O'Malley. The only thing that I can't buy
is time,

164
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:59,194
and you have the only two available
planes in the territory.

165
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:02,933
Now, you're probably a damn good pilot.
-Ah, come on, lady. The Waziris are at
war with the British.

166
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:05,503
-Well, we'll tell them we're Americans.

167
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:07,671
-That's right, we're Americans!

168
00:16:07,672 --> 00:16:09,879
-And if they shoot first?
-I'll take that chance.

-Good. You take that chance.

170
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,193
-Alright. You can have another 10,000 pounds
for dangerous natives.

171
00:16:16,194 --> 00:16:20,700
-And what if there's no place to land?
-Another 5,000 ought to cover any damages.

172
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:23,500
-That's fair.

173
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:27,312
-Then there's the plague.

174
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:37,822
-And another 5,000 for the plague.
That's 30,000 pounds, Mr. O'Malley.

175
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,471
-Unh-unh.

You can't buy me, kid.

-Ah, we have a man of principle here, Charlie.

178
00:16:50,117 --> 00:16:53,326
Alright. I double my offer.

You just bought yourself one slightly used flying instructor,
and one ace mechanic.

184
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,457
I want half the money now!
And the other half in the London bank.

185
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:27,461
-No, Mr. O'Malley.
We'll give you 5 percent now.

186
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:31,082
And the rest in a Swiss bank.
-Deal.

00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:35,161
-Pay them, will you Charlie?

come to the theatre?

a magnificent idea.

-Yeah.

Yeah.

00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:14,869

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,729
Really close.

-Darling, I'm absolutely fascinated.

302
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:29,236
Could you just hold that thought
one minute? Excuse me.

303
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:33,104
-Sounds jolly dangerous, sir.
-Nah it's a piece of cake, right Struts?

304
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:36,902
-Excuse me.  Mr. O'Malley.
-What?

305
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:38,997
-I think you've had quite
enough to drink for one

-I don't need you to tell me

-Well, as your employer--

-Piss off.

309
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:46,082
-Well, I say, O'Malley, that's really
just a bit too much.

310
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,422
-Maybe we ought to get a
little shuteye.

-Listen, ace. I don't buy all this
phony garbage that you're

312

-The only phony around here
is the one I'm looking at.

All you rich bitches are the same.

-Oh, don't give me that, O'Malley. The
only reason you're here is because of money.

I care, you can take your money and shove it.

back to serious drinking, huh?

-Mr. O'Malley. I will be leaving

-Mr. Bentik.

335
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:45,667
They've contacted that Arab lad.

336
00:28:45,668 --> 00:28:48,796
They think the girl is going
to Waziristan.

-Where is Waziristan?

-Well, of course I know that.

Whereabouts in Afghanistan?
Never mind.

340
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,958
Contact all my agents in the district.

341
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:00,082
Tell them that girl must be
stopped, at all costs.

342
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,161
-But, we don't have any agents
in Afghanistan, Mr. Bentik.

The Waziris killed them all.

-Nonsense.  Offer 100,000
rubies to the one who sees her.

345

-You mean "rupees"?
-I said "rupees"!

346
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:14,637
-Yeah, but that's only 23 pounds, Mr. Bentik.

347
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:17,937
-Very well, then. Make it
a million rupees.

348
00:29:17,938 --> 00:29:21,841
Offer a million rupees.  Offer
them 10 million rupees.

349
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:24,317
-We don't have 10 million rupees, Mr. Bentik.

350
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:28,834
-I said offer them 10 million rupees. I didn't
say pay them 10 million rupees, you fool!

351
00:29:30,014 --> 00:29:32,360
Why are you wearing that idiotic tie?

352
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:36,452
-Well, I thought that--
-Take it off at once!

-Couldn't you have a better
place to land?

-Which one is the Khan?
-He'll get here.

357

And when he does, I advise
you to keep your trap shut.

-Speak?!

456
00:40:34,752 --> 00:40:38,461
If you or one more person tells me
to speak or to not speak

457
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:41,326
or to lower my eyes, I am
going to let you have it!

458
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:44,564
I don't care if you kill me,
I'm going to let you have it!

-What are you doing down there?
-I've come to help you.

-Help me? How?

461
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:52,486
-To escape. If you allow me, I want
to go with you.

462
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:56,393
-Hey, that's great. You don't happen to have
a couple of machine guns on you, do you?

463
00:40:56,394 --> 00:41:01,530
-Do you know if my father is here?
-No, he escaped. He has been gone for a year.

-Well, where's he gone?

465
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:07,720
-We spoke many times of my village, in Nepal.
He said he would go there when he left.

-Alright. Why didn't you go with him?

467
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:13,671
-I was captured four years ago, by
the Suleman Khan.

468
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:19,039
And my brother was killed. He was
tortured to death, while I watched.

469
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,826
I've been a slave here now, since then.

470
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:25,522
I wish I were dead like my brothers.

-Is there any chance that

472
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:32,924
you could get some clothes for these two?
Hats? Robes?

-Yes, I can.
-Okay.

474

-How far away from here is your village?
-Forget it. I know what you're thinking,
and you can just forget it.

-Listen, don't you tell me--
-Our deal was to get to Waziristan.

Nepal is on the other side of India.
-Our deal was to find my father.

477
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:51,545
-Finding your father has nothing to do with it.
I wasn't that drunk.
-You're always that drunk!

-Alright, hold it.

479
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:58,119
Why don't we just figure how to get out of here,
and worry about fathers and deals where it's safe.

he will see that you do it carefully. And
return, when you need more.

00:42:24,114 --> 00:42:25,744
-Ah, no, no.

485
00:42:25,745 --> 00:42:30,112
Your nephew here, can have the honor of
dropping some of these bombs himself.

He must get in the front, so that I
can steer from the back.

-Remember, the English lives for your friends'.

out of my face, until we're in the air?

-I know that, Mr. Bentik. But she's
been seen in India.

-They don't.
-What?!

00:58:55,134 --> 00:58:58,319
-What do you want now?

607
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,363
-We found where your father's gone.

608
00:59:00,364 --> 00:59:05,171
-Where?
-It's through the mountains in Zhenjiang.
It's a province in China.

609
00:59:05,172 --> 00:59:08,638
-Well, how soon before the planes can be ready
and we can get out of here?

610
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:12,342
-Forget it, you're not going.
-What do you mean, I'm not going?

611
00:59:12,343 --> 00:59:14,736
-You heard me.

612
00:59:14,737 --> 00:59:20,077
-Since when are you in charge of this
expedition, Mr. O'Malley?

613
00:59:20,078 --> 00:59:22,484
Come back here!

614
00:59:26,894 --> 00:59:29,872
-Hey, O'Malley, here she comes.

615
00:59:29,873 --> 00:59:32,888
-Just ignore her. Maybe
she'll go away.

616
00:59:36,916 --> 00:59:40,189
-O'Malley, I want to talk to you.
-Don't bother me, I'm busy.

617
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:44,611
-You son of a bitch. This is my trip
and I am paying the freight.Zhejiang

618
00:59:44,612 --> 00:59:47,325
Now, I have been robbed, I have been
shot at,

619
00:59:47,326 --> 00:59:49,395
I have been beaten up, I have
been bombed...

620
00:59:49,396 --> 00:59:51,135
-Do you need this?
-Nah, you can dump it.

621
00:59:51,136 --> 00:59:54,801
-...you practically sold me into slavery. And all
of a sudden...
-Will you two cut it out?

622
00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:58,996
-..you decide, that some mountains are too
tough for the likes of a poor little,
defenseless creature like me.

623
00:59:58,997 --> 01:00:00,933
Now, that is garbage, O'Malley!
It is unmitigated garbage!

624
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:04,436
If you would just listen to me, for once...
-Hey, O'Malley!

625
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:08,778
You hear something?

626
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:13,075
-Look, I put up the money for this trip. And
if you think that I'm gonna sit here, while

627
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,947
you fly off and get--
-Shut up.

628

-Don't tell me to shut up.

Struts! Come on, come on, let's go.

632
01:00:52,829 --> 01:00:56,504
-O'Malley, what should I do?
-Just get out of here.

633
01:00:56,505 --> 01:01:00,641
-Go get 'em, Ace.
-Clear it!

634
01:03:11,811 --> 01:03:15,373
-Is he alright?
-I think he's okay.

635
01:03:23,096 --> 01:03:25,372
You alright, O'Malley?
-Yeah.

636
01:03:25,373 --> 01:03:27,690
-Did you get him?
-Yeah, I got him.

637
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:31,418
-Boy, he really shot you up, didn't he?
-Yep. He did.

638
01:03:32,323 --> 01:03:35,906
-What happened? Where is he?
-Never mind where he is. I want to know

639
01:03:35,907 --> 01:03:37,715
where he came from.
-What do you mean?

640
01:03:37,716 --> 01:03:40,978
-Come here. I want to show
you something.

641
01:03:40,979 --> 01:03:42,530
See that?

Jesus Christ! Look at my plane!

643
01:03:53,155 --> 01:03:57,101
Now, I want the truth. Who
was that guy?

644
01:03:57,102 --> 01:04:00,586
-Well, it might have been Bentik. You
know, the man who gets everything and--

01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:01,719
-Hold it.

646
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,850
Hold it.

647
01:04:03,851 --> 01:04:06,249
Let me get this straight.

648
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,246
There are people trying to kill us?
-Well, I wasn't sure-

649
01:04:09,247 --> 01:04:12,380
-Hold it! Just wait a minute.

650
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:16,272
That day... when we left

651
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:20,460
That guy wasn't shooting at me.
He was after you.

652
01:04:20,461 --> 01:04:22,000
-Yes, and I was gonna tell you that--

653
01:04:22,001 --> 01:04:26,667
-Of all the rotten! dirty! dealing double-tricks,
that takes the cake.

654
01:04:26,668 --> 01:04:27,998
Look at my plane!

-Well, I'm sorry, I never thought it
would go this far.

656
01:04:30,721 --> 01:04:35,526
-Oh, that's a hot one. You never thought of
anyone else but yourself in your entire life.

You're nothing but a spoiled, snooty,
rich little brat!

-I'll buy you another plane.
-You're damn right you will.

And that's over and above
the hundred thousand.

660
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,738
-Does that mean you're still going?
-Yeah, that's right, I'm still going.

661
01:04:50,739 --> 01:04:52,144
But I'm going solo.

662
01:04:52,145 --> 01:04:56,519
-No! No. I will not give you one penny
unless I go too.

663
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,201
-That's not part of the deal.
-So, sue me!

664
01:04:59,202 --> 01:05:02,267
-I don't have to sue ya. I'll wring your
scrawny little neck.

one good reason why I should take you along.

-You alright?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

How long you think it'll take us
to fix her up?

675
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:37,269
-Ah, everything's going to be okay.
It just needs a little patching.

676
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:40,417
This means you're going to go, huh?

677

-Yeah, I got to.
-Her too?

-Hey, ace, uh,

682

would you do me a little favor, please?
-Yeah, sure.

Excuse me, sir.
-What is it?

687
01:08:35,614 --> 01:08:38,993
-Well, I-I've been in touch with Major
Von Hess' headquarters in Delhi.

688
01:08:38,994 --> 01:08:43,165
They've had no word from him. They
rather fear he may be... lost.

-How do you mean "lost"?

690

-Well, they can't find his plane.

691
01:08:47,604 --> 01:08:49,851
-Well, where did they lose him?

692

-If they knew that, Mr. Bentik, he- he
wouldn't really be lost. Would he?

the way out here, in the middle of China?

Not much of a war, as wars go,
but it's a war.

he's been climbing this hill for 20 years.

then he rapes their women.

I hate to be the one to break tradition,
but somebody sooner or later,

gonna have to stop this.
-General!

why they call me General, but I kind of like it.

727
01:13:58,281 --> 01:14:03,595
Now, I gotta go with this guy. Don't you
people go nowhere, I'll be right back.

-Well, he's something else. I'll
give you that for him.

-You know, I think I'd actually forgotten
how wonderful he was.

731
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:19,205
Even when I was a little girl, he always
seemed to be rushing around,

or doing something important.

733

-Did you always call him "daddy"?

734
01:14:22,856 --> 01:14:25,055
-Yes, why?

735
01:14:25,056 --> 01:14:27,195
-No reason.

We don't have much time.

738
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:37,118
So, if you tell him right away, I'm gonna try
and fly out of here, before it gets too dark.

739
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:42,229
-Yes, I'm aware of that, Mr. O'Malley.
I'm aware of that.

-What's going on?
-He's moving his cannon.

-Nothing.

-Then we gas up overnight. Then
another day to Guilin.

745

One more day to Hong Kong, if we're lucky.
Are you listening to this?

746
01:15:27,592 --> 01:15:29,314
-Yes. Of course.

747
01:15:29,315 --> 01:15:34,758
-That should give us an extra day to
get him into a British court.

748
01:15:34,759 --> 01:15:37,502
-Well, that's it. It's like I figured.

749

He's moving his cannon.

750
01:15:39,705 --> 01:15:44,607
He's seen your plane. He's taken it as
some kind of an omen, and he's coming.

751
01:15:44,608 --> 01:15:47,586
Tonight, probably. Tomorrow morning at
the very latest.

752
01:15:47,587 --> 01:15:50,232
The two of you gotta get the hell out of here.
-But we just got here!

753
01:15:50,233 --> 01:15:54,997
-I know, and you just gotta leave. You can't stay
here, it's dangerous. You might get killed.

754
01:15:54,998 --> 01:15:59,387
-But we want you to come with us. I
came here to take you back.

755
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:03,608
-Nope. I can't go with you.

756
01:16:03,609 --> 01:16:08,614
Take a look around. Do you see these people?

757
01:16:08,615 --> 01:16:12,467
These people need me.

758
01:16:12,468 --> 01:16:17,318
It ain't gonna mean much, as far as
the world turning goes.

759
01:16:17,319 --> 01:16:22,051
But, honey, there's battle's gotta be
fought. This may be one of them.

760
01:16:22,052 --> 01:16:25,362
I'll bet you know what I mean, O'Malley.

761

-Yeah, I told myself that a couple of times.
-Sure you have. Everybody has.

762
01:16:29,175 --> 01:16:33,652
And I want to thank you for bringing
her all this way to see me. It means alot.

763
01:16:33,653 --> 01:16:37,797
Now, do you want to do me a big favor? Load
her back in that plane, and get her back over

764
01:16:37,798 --> 01:16:40,426
them mountains just as goddamn
soon as you can.

765
01:16:40,427 --> 01:16:44,228
-Well, we can't leave until morning
anyway. It's too dark to fly.

766
01:16:46,274 --> 01:16:48,745
-Alright.

767
01:16:48,746 --> 01:16:52,424
Come sunrise, you get in that plane.
You get the hell out of here.

768
01:16:52,425 --> 01:16:55,237
And no nonsense, you hear me?

769
01:16:57,019 --> 01:17:00,515
He's coming.

770
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:04,566
I'm ready for him! Now, Evie, you go
with Chenwa there. She'll show you

771
01:17:04,567 --> 01:17:07,613
where you can clean up and lie down.
O'Malley, you're gonna come with me.

772
01:17:07,614 --> 01:17:10,595
I'm gonna show you just how I'm gonna
whip this little bastard.

773
01:17:10,596 --> 01:17:13,089
-Oh, actually, I'd kind of like to clean up
and lay down too.

774
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:16,399
-Oh no, no, no, no. None of it, you come with me.
-Let me take your coat for you, O'Malley.

Off you go.

777
01:17:19,538 --> 01:17:25,233
O'Malley, you come with me. Now,
I built myself a foundry here.

778
01:17:25,234 --> 01:17:28,846
Mr. O'Malley, would you come
and walk with me?

779
01:17:28,847 --> 01:17:32,189
-Sure
-Good, come on.

780
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:37,283
Like I said, I've set up a foundry here.
I'm trying to forge out a cannon.

781
01:17:37,284 --> 01:17:40,034
It won't do a bit of good though, I've
got no copper.

782
01:17:40,035 --> 01:17:43,220
I can't make no cases, therefore
I got no goddamn shells.

783
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:46,729
-No shells? Right. What good's a cannon
if you don't have any shells?

784
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:50,116
-Well, it's part of the game you see. These
people are peasants. They're like children.

785
01:17:50,117 --> 01:17:53,798
They figure this General Wang's got a cannon,
and they ain't got one.

786
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:56,250
Explosives. That's my game. That's
the ticket here.

787
01:17:56,251 --> 01:17:59,922
I've set up 400 mines in front of this town,
just waiting for him to come across.

788
01:17:59,923 --> 01:18:04,132
I'll blow him off the face of the earth.
I could whip this guy by myself.

What are you and my daughter
really doing here?

792
01:18:26,412 --> 01:18:30,401
-Oh no, I think you better ask her that.
I'm just kind of the hired help.

793
01:18:30,402 --> 01:18:33,116
-I got a reason for asking.

794
01:18:33,117 --> 01:18:36,307
Tell me what she's doing here.

795
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:47,055
-Well, your partner, or someone, is trying
to have you declared legally dead,

796
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:51,567
so he can take over your company. She just came
here to bring you back, before he could do it.

797
01:18:51,568 --> 01:18:53,246
-Bentik?
-Guess so.

798
01:18:53,247 --> 01:18:57,351
-Well.. he's welcome to it!
What's left of it.

799
01:18:57,352 --> 01:19:00,882
I'm surprised he hasn't bankrupted already.

800
01:19:00,883 --> 01:19:04,070
You see, all the formulas and patents are
in my name anyway.

801
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:08,118
If I'm declared dead, that stuff
all goes to Evie.

802
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:11,248
-What?
-Sure! He'll have the company

803
01:19:11,249 --> 01:19:14,700
but she'll have all the real wealth.

804
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:43,839
-What's going on?
-I'm washing my feet. What does it look like?

805
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,477
-Well, get your things together. We're getting
out of here. What'd you do with my map?

806
01:19:47,478 --> 01:19:50,783
-What do you mean "we're getting out of here"?
It's too late, it'll be dark.

807
01:19:50,784 --> 01:19:53,437
-Oh, come on. Look, kid, this is me you're
talking to now. We can be

808
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:55,553
a hundred miles away from here before
it gets too dark.

809
01:19:55,554 --> 01:19:58,008
-Yes, but you heard what my father said.
He won't come with us.

810
01:19:58,009 --> 01:20:02,593
-He doesn't have to. He explained the whole
thing to me. You'll have as much money

811
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:04,517
as you ever had. Probably a hell of a lot more.
-You told him?

812
01:20:04,518 --> 01:20:06,316
-He asked me.
-What did you say?

813

-What's the difference?
-What did you say?

814
01:20:08,364 --> 01:20:11,133
-Your money's safe. That's what you came
here to find out, isn't it?

815
01:20:11,134 --> 01:20:14,419
So, let's get out of here while we've still got
a chance. Come on, sit down. Get your clothes on.

816
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:17,275
What the hell'd you do with my coat?
-Well, what about him? If we leave, he'll

817
01:20:17,276 --> 01:20:19,907
be all alone.
-He was alone yesterday. And the day before.

818
01:20:19,908 --> 01:20:23,091
So what? He doesn't need us.
He's got his war.

819
01:20:23,092 --> 01:20:27,643
And you got your money. Now, if i can just find
my coat, it'll be a happy ending all the way around.

-No.
-No what?

-No, I'm not going.
Why can't we wait?

-What for? He wants you to go!

824
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:42,432
He can handle all this without us. To
him it's just a turkey shoot.

825
01:20:42,433 --> 01:20:45,487
-He's just saying that to protect me,
and make us leave.

826
01:20:45,488 --> 01:20:48,219
No, I'm not going without him, and
that's final.

-Final?
-Yes.

along. You're nuts. And now that

01:30:29,303 --> 01:30:33,230
-It was always a wreck, O'Malley.

902
01:30:38,113 --> 01:30:41,221
-Down. Put your head down.

903
01:31:10,178 --> 01:31:12,059
Here, take this.

904
01:31:12,060 --> 01:31:14,592
-Where are you going?
-To get the Louis gun.

905
01:31:14,593 --> 01:31:16,377
-It's empty!

906
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:24,069
This is empty too!

907
01:31:39,282 --> 01:31:43,526
-Now, when I fire the next time,
you start running.

908
01:32:18,231 --> 01:32:20,471
-Say Wong!

909
01:32:20,991 --> 01:32:22,971
It's me, Tozer!

910
01:32:22,972 --> 01:32:25,892
How do you do?!

911
01:32:36,784 --> 01:32:38,449
-Keep your head down.

912
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:40,856
-What's going on?
-It looks like your father is starting

913
01:32:40,857 --> 01:32:44,423
his show. Here, wipe your face.
It's dirty.

914
01:32:50,198 --> 01:32:53,190
-Wong!

915
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:02,279
Take that, you son of a bitch!

916
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:11,067
Wire them.

917
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:54,231
Hoist the colors.
-Yes, sir.

918
01:34:11,334 --> 01:34:14,012
-They're going.

919
01:34:14,013 --> 01:34:16,429
-What?

920
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:18,168
-Yeah.

921
01:34:22,657 --> 01:34:24,932
It's over.

922
01:34:24,933 --> 01:34:27,989
I guess your old man won.

923
01:34:33,854 --> 01:34:35,244
Ha, yeah.

924
01:34:36,953 --> 01:34:39,530
Sure could use a drink.

925
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:43,255
-Make it a double.

926
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,936
-Well...

927
01:34:57,886 --> 01:35:00,749
Thank you, O'Malley.
-What for?

928
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:05,558
-For just about everthing, I think.

929
01:35:05,559 --> 01:35:09,258
For getting me here. For taking
care of me.

930
01:35:11,213 --> 01:35:14,090
-Uh.. sure, squirt. Any time.

931
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:20,363
Listen, you better go back. Your
old man might need you.

932
01:35:20,364 --> 01:35:23,335
-Oh, thank you.

933
01:35:28,410 --> 01:35:30,407
What are you going to do?

934
01:35:30,408 --> 01:35:32,268
-Me?

935
01:35:36,114 --> 01:35:39,947
Well, I guess I'll just sit here
with my plane.

936
01:35:39,948 --> 01:35:42,894
Figure things out.

937
01:35:43,469 --> 01:35:47,063
It's a long walk back to Nepal.

938
01:35:47,894 --> 01:35:50,424
-Yeah, it's mostly uphill.

939
01:35:52,338 --> 01:35:54,667
-Yeah.

940
01:36:06,782 --> 01:36:08,447
-Well

941
01:36:15,716 --> 01:36:18,089
See you around, ace.

942
01:36:27,994 --> 01:36:29,925
-Hey!

943
01:36:45,611 --> 01:36:48,483
Come here a minute.

944
01:37:12,696 --> 01:37:15,002
Closer.

945
01:37:24,346 --> 01:37:27,525
Now...

946
01:37:27,526 --> 01:37:29,745
Put your arms around me.

947
01:37:39,302 --> 01:37:42,542
You know, I only made one real mistake.

948
01:37:43,503 --> 01:37:46,086
-What was that?

949
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:51,294
-I should have sold you when I had the chance.
