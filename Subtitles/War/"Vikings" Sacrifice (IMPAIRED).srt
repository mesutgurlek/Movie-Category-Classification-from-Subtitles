Leif, you are my friend.

Athelstan: I would

Ragnar: Every nine years,

36
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:03,411
we travel to the temple
at Uppsala,

37
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,679
to give thanks to the gods

38
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,616
and to offer them sacrifices
for all they do for us.

39
00:02:08,684 --> 00:02:12,620
For protecting us,
for the success in battle,

40
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:16,124
<i>for the rains that they bring</i>
<i>that grow our crops</i>

41
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:20,228
and, of course,
for our children.

42

<i>This year</i>
<i>I was not going to go,</i>

43

for there is too much to do
around here.

44
00:02:32,674 --> 00:02:37,945
Then my unborn son
was cruelly taken from me,

45
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,851
and it made me wonder
what I had done

46
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,187
<i>to anger the gods.</i>

47
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:01,769
What do christians do
about such pain?

48
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:06,374
In the Bible, it says that
all sorrows will pass.

49
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:12,914
In any case,
I've decided to go.

50
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:18,219
I'm going to take the children
for the first time,

51
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,788
for it's important
that they go.

53
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:26,694

No, I'll gladly come with you.

Of course I'm happy.

When we reach Uppsala,

we shall ask the gods
why they give with one hand,

but take away with the other?

77
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:11,699
Why they make me Earl,
yet kill my son?

78
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:16,671
We can have more sons.

328
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,921
the six uncles
that killed your father.

329
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:44,989

330
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,159

and brothers.

331
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:53,531
Ragnar: I also know how you
favor the poets at your court,

332
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:56,100
and your people respect
your law making,

333
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:58,136
your justice, and your rule.

334
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:03,308
And as a consequence,
here, on this site,

335
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:06,644
in the living presence
of the gods,

336
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:11,883
I offer you my fealty

337
00:26:13,052 --> 00:26:15,220
and my service.

338
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:25,897
I accept your pledge,
with a glad heart.

339
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:30,902
What can I do for you
in return?

340
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:35,173
You could join forces with me.

341
00:26:35,274 --> 00:26:36,341

342
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:39,344
with what I have achieved
so far.

343
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:43,581
I want to send bigger
raiding parties to the west;

344
00:26:43,682 --> 00:26:45,116
Yes, to plunder,

345
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:48,119
but also to explore new lands.

346
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,455
There are other lands
to the west?

347
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:52,991
There is a kingdom
called Frankia...

348
00:26:53,092 --> 00:26:56,060
a kingdom far larger,
far richer,

349
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:59,797
and far more powerful
than england.

350
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:01,900

Athelstan: I was a

354
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:16,347
I traveled to other lands
as a missionary.

355
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:18,983

<i>and of their God.</i>

357
00:27:21,921 --> 00:27:24,656
And are you still a Christian?

358
00:27:26,392 --> 00:27:27,458
No.

359
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,793
King Horik: Of course not!

360
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:32,363
How could you be a Christian
and walk among our gods?

361
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:34,265

<i>Ragnar Lothbrok,</i>

363

with you,

364
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,472
since, as king,
I am naturally not in favor

365
00:27:41,573 --> 00:27:43,541
of individual enterprise

366
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,977
by my earls, or anyone else.

367
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:50,381
But, believe me,
I will be happy enough

368
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:52,083
just to have my name
linked with yours

369
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:56,020
when the poets tell the story
of how we norsemen sailed west

370
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:58,022
and discovered new worlds.

371
00:27:59,024 --> 00:28:00,858

Siggy: Why did you
bother to come back?

375
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:18,409

376
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,844
Hmm.

377
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:27,452
How many women
have you been with?

378
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,721
I don't suppose you know.

379
00:28:29,822 --> 00:28:32,457
I do what I want here.

380
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:35,126
I thought we came here
together.

381
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:37,495
We came here with Earl Ragnar.

382
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:39,464
I thought we came here
together and...

383
00:28:39,565 --> 00:28:42,867
we did come here together.

384
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:44,969
We are together.

385
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:49,941
Why do you keep pestering me?

386
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:51,342
(Scoffs)

387
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:55,780
I am who I am
and I won't change,

388
00:28:57,383 --> 00:29:00,018
not for you,
not for my brother,

389
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,553
not for anyone.

390
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:07,925
So leave if you want to.

391
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:16,234
But one day
I will be a great man

392
00:29:16,335 --> 00:29:17,702
and you'll regret leaving me

393
00:29:17,803 --> 00:29:21,172
just because I sleep
with other women.

394
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:41,059
If you really want to be
a great man,

395
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,896
should you not be meeting
with king Horik now?

396
00:29:44,997 --> 00:29:46,064
What do you mean?

397
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:50,334
Siggy: Well, that's where
your brother is now,

398
00:29:52,104 --> 00:29:53,137
and no doubt
he's already boasting

399
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:55,339
about how he sailed west,
alone,

400
00:29:55,441 --> 00:29:59,510
and all he has achieved...
Alone.

401
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:02,980
If you weren't so stubborn
and so drunk,

402
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:06,017
you would be there too,
but you weren't invited.

403
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:09,220
You didn't even know about it.

404
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:13,224
I could have told you.

405
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:16,961
You see, rollo,

406
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:19,464

I drink to your good fortune.

412
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:46,919
May the gods continue
to favor you

413
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,522
and increase your fame.

414
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:53,626
May they do the same to you,
king Horik.

415
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:55,628
You have done me the honor
of pledging your fealty,

416
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:56,862
as Earl, to me.

417
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:59,698
Forgive me, then,
if I seem anxious

418
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:03,802
to make use of your skills
and reputation...

As soon as possible.

420
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,809
To do what?

421
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:14,079
There is a Jarl in Gotaland,
Jarl Borg.

422
00:31:14,147 --> 00:31:15,314
He is an important fellow,

423
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,917
but he continues to claim
he has legal rights

424
00:31:18,018 --> 00:31:20,286
over some of my land.

425
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:21,720
He threatens me.

426
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:24,623
He nearly invaded my territory
a year ago,

427
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:27,092
but at the last moment
he drew back.

428
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,763
And now, once again,

429
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:34,667
he is making
threatening noises.

430
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:42,675
And how can I be of help
in such a matter?

431
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:49,882
Would you be prepared to travel
to Gotaland as my emissary?

432
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,050
I can think of no one

433
00:31:51,151 --> 00:31:52,785
who I would rather
represent my case,

434
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:56,689
for your fame is widespread.

435
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,891
