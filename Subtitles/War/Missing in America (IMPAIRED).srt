They wouldn't come.

501
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,764
Then we should go
to them.

Well, first of all,

508
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,186
they might not want
to have anything to do
with us.

509
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,018
And plus, maybe I don't want
anything to do with them.

510
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,582
Maybe I'm happy
the way things are.

You don't seem
very happy to me.

I don't know.

What happened?

829
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:57,145
I was running,
and I slipped.

830
01:05:57,219 --> 01:06:00,245
Damn girl,
your dad
would've killed me.

Come here.

a few weeks back,

I would've done
just that.

none of this happened,
