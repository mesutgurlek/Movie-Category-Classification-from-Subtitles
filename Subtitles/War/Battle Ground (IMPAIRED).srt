- Make way. Coming through.

lt's a bit late for that, Rich.

Wait, wait. Hey, stop, stop.

No.

But l'm certain you'll have more success.

Sir, with all due respect,

64
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,397
a forward assault
on those machine guns is suicide.

65
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:04,206
Those are your orders, Sergeant Major.

66
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,046
Yes, sir.

67
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,317
At 21 :00 hours the big boys
will be smashing the lines again,

Let's save the strategy
for those who know best, shall we?

Yes, sir.

72
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,079
Just make damn sure you take that trench.

73
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,920
Any cowardice is to be punished.
Do you understand?

You're going to have to give me a minute.

The whole bloody world will hear me.

You don't have a minute.

You always look on the bright side.

No, sir.

359
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,166

lt's a pity Ollie is not here.

...do you remember who we were
when we first met?

368

Don't be too hard on yourself, sir.

369
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:07,684
You're the sanest man l know.

370

l've been out here so long...

...l can't see her face any more.

When l close my eyes,
it's just this photo that l see.

373
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,365
lt's still enough.

374
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:34,882
lt's enough to get you back home.

375
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:49,758
May l see, sir?

376
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:10,805
l don't have anyone like this
waiting for me.

377

l wish l did.

378
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:16,518
l'd carry a picture of my mam with me,

379
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,678

would give me shite about that all day.

l'm sorry, Mrs Wilkins. l can't help you.

383

l took a huge risk coming here.

l'm not fit to carry this child.

385

You helped that lady from Wessex.

386
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:33,840
She had a medical condition
that endangered her life. You are healthy.

387

There's more at risk here
than just my licence to practise.

lt's out of the question, l'm afraid.

Please, sir. l'm desperate. l can pay.

The nurse will talk to you
about your health during pregnancy.

Just take it easy.

How long has your husband been away?

405
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:59,560
My fiance was sent to Europe
nearly three years ago.

[footsteps upstairs]

l haven't had a letter in over a year.

409
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:13,882
The last one l got
had so many holes cut through it.

410
00:42:14,887 --> 00:42:17,162
lt's enough to catch the sentiment, but...

411
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:20,956
...l can't stop worrying.

412
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:26,040
[whispers] He'd be devastated.

413
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:27,646
l can't let him suffer this.

414
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:30,844
Or you can move away,
have the child and adopt it out.

415
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,201
l have nowhere to go.

416
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:37,037
And if my family were to learn of it, they'd
disown me. l'd have nothing to come back to.

417
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:42,235
Just don't make any rash decisions
until you've really thought it through.

You're not the only one, Grace.

419

l should go. l'm sorry.

Do you have anyone to stay with you?
lt's not a good idea for you to be alone.

He'd sooner make a run for it

Don't be too hard on him, sir.

Well...

506
00:51:41,887 --> 00:51:44,640
Sometimes Millie
cries herself to sleep at night,

507
00:51:44,807 --> 00:51:47,958
wondering what he looks like,
what sort of man he'll grow up to be.

508
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:50,524
- But at least...
- l've made my decision, Eve.

509
00:51:53,807 --> 00:51:55,126
Well...

510
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:00,160
l'm sorry to hear that.

511
00:52:12,207 --> 00:52:14,004
You've seen these procedures.

512
00:52:16,247 --> 00:52:17,441
You said it yourself.

513
00:52:18,607 --> 00:52:20,438
- No, Grace.
- Eve, please.

514
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,926
You have to do this for me.

515
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:25,443
l'm not a doctor. l'm not trained for this.

516
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:28,603
There's no one else.

517
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:34,324
l know what l'm asking of you.

518
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:38,918
But this isn't about me.

519
00:52:41,567 --> 00:52:45,003
l couldn't bear it if Arthur arrived home
to more pain than he endured out there.

520
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:48,557
And how much pain would you cause him
if you were to die?

521
00:52:55,887 --> 00:52:58,447
Would your fiance still have you

522
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:00,996
if you were carrying another man's child?

523
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:15,839
Do you have a picture of him?

524
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:19,240
Your husband?

525
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,803
l hope he's worth it, Grace.

526
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:08,397
That's a hell of a thing you did for me, sir.

527
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:11,035
All three of us
are getting out of here, Private.

528
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:13,396
Aye, sir.

529
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:21,155
Sir, l mean no disrespect,

530
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:23,841
but l can't help thinking
there's something you're not telling me.

531
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:25,804
And what makes you say that?

532
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:29,476
Every chance you get
you're looking at your watch.

533
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:36,364
Whatever it is, l can handle it.

534
00:54:38,087 --> 00:54:39,600
Tell him, Arthur.

535
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:52,325
All right, then.

00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:56,076
We failed in taking the trenches back.

537
00:54:57,287 --> 00:55:00,836
So at 21 :00 hours, the big boys
will be smashing these lines again.

538
00:55:01,407 --> 00:55:02,396

We're close, sir. We can make it.

542
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:16,039
There's a medic's kit caught
in the barbed wire not ten yards away.

543
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,320
lf we can patch him up,
we might have a chance.

544
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,639
All right. lt's worth a shot.

545

Our boys must know we're out here, right?

562
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:52,876
They'll stop the bombing.

they have no idea.

When the bombardment starts,
we'll make a run for it.

What if it were Frankie lying here, sir?

00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,838
Would you still be risking our lives for him?

571
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:27,563
You think because the man
has his eyes closed he can't hear you?

He's 100 times the man you are!

573

The only reason he's here dying
is because he had the courage to do his duty.

The man was...

that no one knows we're out here,
