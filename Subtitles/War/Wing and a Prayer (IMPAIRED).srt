1
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,961
<i>Where is our navy?</i>

2
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,464
<i>Three months have passed</i>

3
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,966
<i>since the tragedy</i>
<i>at Pearl Harbor...</i>

4
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,471
<i>1 2 die as Jap submarines</i>
<i>strike near San Francisco.</i>

5
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:50,669
<i>Committee demands probe</i>
<i>of navy failure to fight.</i>

6
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:55,874
<i>Where is our navy?</i>
<i>Why doesn't it fight?</i>

7
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,883
We cannot
answer that question.

8
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,318
We must force ourselves
not to listen to it.

9
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,322
We do not intend
to tell theJapanese

10
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,826
how badly our navy
was damaged at Pearl Harbor.

11
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,327
Since December the 7 th,

12
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,660
our prewar strategy
is useless.

13
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,256
The defense
of the Aleutians

14
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,768
and our Pacific Coast
with the Hawaiis

15
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,929
at the apex
of the Triangle

16
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,165
is almost impossible

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,674
with what remains
of our navy.

18
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,677
But we are not considering
a defensive campaign.

19
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,178
You all realize

20
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,681
I'm indulging in
no false heroics

21
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,182
when I say

22
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,685
our only hope
of evading destruction

23
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,687
is to destroy
the enemy.

24
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,188
TheJapanese have won

25
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,192
a quick and staggering
succession of victories.

26
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,195
They're aiming now
at the final knockout--

27
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,197
the capture
of Pearl Harbor.

28
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,698
To accomplish this,

29
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,031
they must first
take Midway.

30
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,536
If they are permitted

31
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,539
to choose the time
and conditions of attack,

32
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,041
we haven't
much of a chance,

33
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,477
but if we can trick them
into meeting us

34
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:02,981
when they think
we are weak,

35
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,983
we then have a chance

36
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,986
of cutting their navy
down to our size

37
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,490
and proceeding with the rest
of the Pacific strategy.

38
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,991
We have learned

39
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,994
there are heavy concentrations
of enemy carriers

40
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,498
and other fleet units
in the Marshall Islands

41
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,727
and a numerous
transport force

42
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,995
making up at Truk.

43
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,197
So our strategy is this.

44
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,345
We shall concentrate
our strength near Midway

45
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,354
in our effort
to spring a trap.

46
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,255
One of our carriers
is already at sea

47
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,759
waiting to carry out
the initial phases

48
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,919
of this strategy.

49
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:49,927
On April the 28th,

50
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,759
this carrier
and its escort

51
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,265
will be off
the Marshall Islands,

52
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,268
close enough
to be detected.

53
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,325
On May the 3rd,

54
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,201
it is to be seen
near the Gilbert Islands

55
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,205
by theJapanese.

56
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,241
On May the 8th,

57
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,708
it will be detected
near Ocean Island,

58
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,211
as if heading
for theJap fleet at Truk,

59
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,214
but it will not attack.

60
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,715
It will turn south,

61
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:13,752
be seen on May the 1 5th
at Guadalcanal.

62
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:25,063
Every time one of our pilots
encounters a Jap plane,

63
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,565
he will return
to the carrier,

64
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,569
as if he did
not stomach a fight.

65
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:34,073
By sending this one carrier
on such a mission,

66
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,574
we hope
to convince the enemy

67
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,577
that our fleet
is scattered,

68
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:42,911
our fighting morale...
shattered.

69
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,418
Actually, we shall be
waiting for them in force

70
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,418
near Midway.

71
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,921
If they fall
for this bait

72
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,422
and attempt an invasion,

73
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,427
we shall then be able
to answer the question--

74
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,793
''Where is our navy?

75
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,456
Why doesn't it fight?''

76
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,656
Pilot to crew.

77
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,192
There's mama.

78
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,726
I see her, Commander.

79
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,172
Pilot to crew.

80
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,874
If you need
a toothpick,

81
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,044
I know where
you can find one.

82
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,524
We'd only need
half that space, Mr. Scott.

83
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,684
Just lower your wheels
and drop your hook,

84
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,694
like putting
a baby to bed.

85

Molton, commanding
Torpedo Five.

97
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,769
What's the scuttlebutt?
What gives?

98
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:01,204
I thought we'd find out
when we got aboard.

99
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,673
Not from us.

100
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,176
I thought with
you guys aboard,

101
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:06,677
we'd have some action.

102
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:07,678
Name's Shubert.

103
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,681

111
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,043
How do you do?

112
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,044
Good to see you.

113
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,104
I've a message for you.

114
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,797
Hey, what's eating Oscar?

115
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,458
Sure making
a long approach.

116
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,503
He's building up
an entrance.

117
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,461
Just feel your way
in, sir. Lightly.

118
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,696
And politely.

119
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,698
Do we have
to shoot him down?

120
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,576
What does he want,
a spotlight?

121
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,077
He's coming in too fast.

122
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,185
Can't he see
that wave-off?

123
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,922
[Siren Sounds]

124
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,821
Assemble your squadron
in the ready room.

125
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,322
Aye, aye, sir.

126
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,664
Boy, I thought
for a while there...

127
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,597
until 1 900...

128
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,828
I thought I'd have
to turn back.

129
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,564
Maybe you should have.

130
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,572
Didn't you see
the wave-off?

131
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,698
Yes, sir.

132
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,505
Did you think the flagman
was waving bye-bye?

133
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,444
To tell you the truth,
I couldn't think.

134
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,449
I had my hands
too full of airplane

135
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,109
at the time.

136
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,948

We have some pretty
good men on board.

number 43 281 1 2,

166
00:14:13,362 --> 00:14:14,795
aviation machinist's mate,

167
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:17,855
first class,
United States Navy,

168
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:20,367
died at 1 600
while under anesthesia

169
00:14:20,436 --> 00:14:25,032
for surgery following
accident on flight deck.

170
00:14:25,107 --> 00:14:26,540
Spangler's next of kin,

171
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:29,042
his mother
Mrs. Edward R. Spangler,

172
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:30,635
361 7 Lee Avenue,

173
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:32,044
Minneapolis, Minnesota.

174
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:35,379
Signed J.B. Golden, commander,
senior medical officer.''

175
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:39,387
A hot pilot
ignored a wave-off.

176
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:40,945
Spangler couldn't
get out of the way.

177
00:14:41,023 --> 00:14:44,220
The prop cut him
nearly in half.

178
00:14:46,462 --> 00:14:48,327
I'm sorry, sir.

179
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:50,331
So was the other pilot.

180
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,866
So was
Spangler's mother.

181
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:54,300
I'd like
to explain, sir--

182
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:55,802
I don't
like explanations.

183
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,477
Secure.

184
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,854
Sorry, sir.

185
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:25,866
The way you and the
others had to take it

186
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:26,923
on account of me.

187
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:29,527
Just don't ignore
any more wave-offs.

188
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:31,095
Aye, aye, sir.

189
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:36,576
Mr. Scott.

190
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,237
Here's some
mail for you.

191
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,406
Oh, thanks.

192
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:45,010
I see the movie fans
haven't forgotten you, sir.

193
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,153
Cunningham?

194
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:52,250
Yes, sir.

195
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,386
I've received this letter
from the admiral.

196
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:56,897
I thought you'd
like to read it.

197
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:08,103
Congratulations.

198
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:10,777
Gentlemen!

199
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:11,778
Gentlemen!

200
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,577
I give you
Cookie Cunningham!

201
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,448
The man who studied
Japanese mathematics

202
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,454
and found you always
get the right answer

203
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,285
by subtracting zero.

204
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:29,230
Who says we don't know
where we're going?

205
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:32,233
I tell you what
I'm going to do.

206
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,565
I'll fly my TBF
clear to Tokyo.

207
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:37,070
I'll drag that
little monkey to 1 5,000

208
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,573
and drop him
like a bomb,

209
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:40,665
right smack on Fujiyama.

210
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:43,176
I can't stand the
canned vegetables

211
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:44,678
you get
on shipboard.

212
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:46,179
But our squadron's
different.

213
00:16:46,248 --> 00:16:47,510
We'll have
fresh vegetables.

214
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:48,515
How come?

215
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:49,608
How?

216
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:53,788
You going to plow up
the flight deck?

217
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:54,914
No, I'm not kidding.

218
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,924
We'll have
some fresh celery,

219
00:16:56,992 --> 00:16:58,789
real juicy tomatoes,
green onions--

220
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:01,728
What are you going
to use for dirt?

221
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:03,230
Water and chemicals.

222
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:04,356
That's the agriculture
of the future.

223
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:07,095
Ya-hoo!

224
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:08,101
Hey, fellows!

225
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,102
Look!

226
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:12,038
Get a load of this!

227
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:13,631
Wait a minute!

228
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:14,641
Hey, wait!

229
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,200
Now don't do that.

230
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:17,643
You did it!

231
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:19,647
It shows it right there.

232
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:21,148
You kissed Betty Grable.

233
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:24,208
If I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

234
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:25,719
Did you
ever kiss Garbo?

235
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:26,719
I've never seen her.

236
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:29,222
When you're in a picture

237
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:32,055
and you have
to kiss Betty Grable--

238
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:34,061
Listen to me--
<i>have to</i>--

239
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:37,064
When you kiss her,
what's it feel like?

240
00:17:37,132 --> 00:17:38,565
Ah, let it lay.

241
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:39,726
I'm serious
about this, Oscar.

242
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:40,825
I really mean it.

243
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:43,838
I mean, do you feel
anything at all,

244
00:17:43,906 --> 00:17:47,637
or is it all just
part of the day's work?

245
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:48,801
Does she breathe deep?

246
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:51,141
Does she kiss you
or you her?

247
00:17:51,213 --> 00:17:52,145
Does she kiss back?

248
00:17:52,214 --> 00:17:54,239
What I want to know is,

249
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:56,750
how does it make
you feel?

250
00:17:56,818 --> 00:18:00,754
The rest of us can only dream
about those girls,

251
00:18:00,822 --> 00:18:03,188
but you've
actually kissed them.

252
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:04,691
What's it like?

253
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,694
Well, it's, uh...

254
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:09,822
it's like nothing
else in this world.

255
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:11,661
- Ahh.
- Ahh.

256
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:14,167
I'll never forget
that first girl

257
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:15,931
I kissed in a picture.

258
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:17,028
Who was it?

259
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:18,037
Yeah. Who?

260
00:18:18,106 --> 00:18:20,199
You think
I'd kiss and tell?

261
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:21,708
In a wardroom?

262
00:18:21,777 --> 00:18:23,210
Come on, Oscar.

263
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:25,143
Well, it's, um...

264
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:29,216
The night before
the scene was to be shot,

265
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:30,717
I didn't sleep.

266
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:32,720
I lay awake all night,

267
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:34,779
just daydreaming
about that kiss.

268
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,585
How do you
daydream at night?

269
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:37,590
Quiet.

270
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,820
Well, how do you?

271
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:41,328
The next morning

272
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:43,296
I got to the studio
an hour earlier,

273
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:44,798
got into my wardrobe,

274
00:18:44,866 --> 00:18:46,561
dashed over to the set.

275
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:49,570
I waited all day
for that one moment

276
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:52,072
when I'd get
to kiss her.

277
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,576
Finally, it was time
for the scene to be shot.

278
00:18:55,644 --> 00:18:57,236
We took our places.

279
00:18:57,312 --> 00:19:00,406
She was wearing the most beautiful
black negligee.

280
00:19:00,482 --> 00:19:01,949
Lovely...

281
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,882
revealing.

282
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:06,512
Her hair was swept back
from her forehead.

283
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,522
Her eyes
were partly closed.

284
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,024
I took her
into my arms...

285
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:13,823
Go on.
Kiss her, you dope!

286
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:15,021
The hairdresser yelled,

287
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:17,190
''You're mussing up
her hairdo.''

288
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:20,701
The director screamed, '' Move your arm.
You're tilting her collar.''

289
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:23,203
The cameraman said,
''I can't see her nose.''

290
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:26,297
So I kissed her off-center
and smacked the air.

291
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,536
If you want
to kiss a girl right,

292
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,669
you got
to join the navy.

293
00:19:30,746 --> 00:19:33,681
Hey! You can't
get away with that!

294
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,883
Hey! Hey! Gather 'round.

295
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:39,386
I want
to tell you something.

296
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:41,319
Your worries are over.

297
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,553
Listen to the voice
of Superman.

298
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:49,129
<i>I'll tell you what</i>
<i>I'm going to do.</i>

299
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:52,132
<i>I'll fly my TBF</i>
<i>clear to Tokyo.</i>

300
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,634
<i>Throw a rope</i>
<i>around Tojo's neck,</i>

301
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:57,638
<i>like I roped coyotes</i>
<i>back in Texas.</i>

302
00:19:57,706 --> 00:20:00,641
<i>I'll drag that</i>
<i>monkey to 1 5,000 feet</i>

303
00:20:00,709 --> 00:20:02,734
<i>and drop him</i>
<i>like a bomb...</i>

304
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:03,869
Very funny.

305
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:07,244
I wouldn't want
to bore you guys

306
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:09,749
with what I'm
really going to do.

307
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:12,252
It sure takes
a load off our minds.

308
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,584
That guy there
might possibly give you

309
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:15,782
a few pointers.

310
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:18,223
He's only shot down
three Zeros.

311
00:20:19,561 --> 00:20:22,496
I'm just a bag of wind
from Texas.

312
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:23,997
I must sound funny

313
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:26,933
to a guy who's done
the things you've done.

314
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:28,094
How do you feel

315
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,604
when those meatballs
come at you?

316
00:20:30,672 --> 00:20:32,105
I didn't see them

317
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:33,266
until they were
pretty close.

318
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:34,706
Did they attack
from above?

319
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,708
From below.

320
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,039
They missed
with their first pass.

321
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,774
They say they can attack,
pull out,

322
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:42,282
and dive again
before you see them.

323
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,749
Slow but with
maneuverability?

324
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:45,252
I don't know, really--

325
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,255
They machine-gun you
on the way down?

326
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:49,756

wouldn't give him a nickname.

01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,504
Take it easy.
What is this?

820
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:58,170
Sorry. I guess
we're all a little jumpy.

821
01:05:58,245 --> 01:05:59,678
Relax. As for you, Scott,

822
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,682
there are no stars here.
This isn't Hollywood.

823

When it's time for you
to take your bows,

824
01:06:05,686 --> 01:06:07,620
we'll turn
on the spotlights.

825
01:06:07,688 --> 01:06:10,623
Now you're just a part
of a team,

826
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:13,626
and you'll play as
the team plays. Understood?

Men, ever since
Pearl Harbor,

834
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:37,710
our country
has been asking,

835
01:08:37,778 --> 01:08:41,839
''Where is our navy?
Why don't they fight?''

836

<i>asking the same question.</i>

<i>I must confess,</i>
<i>so have I.</i>

839

<i>We've been humiliated.</i>

841

<i>We've had to avoid combat</i>

<i>clean out of the sky.</i>

844

<i>theJapanese inability</i>
<i>to deviate from a plan</i>

855

<i>once it had been made.</i>

856
01:09:28,395 --> 01:09:32,024
<i>We knew their next move was</i>
<i>to capture Pearl Harbor,</i>

857
01:09:32,099 --> 01:09:34,033
<i>but first they'd</i>
<i>have to take Midway.</i>

858
01:09:34,101 --> 01:09:35,432
<i>We deceived theJaps</i>

859
01:09:35,502 --> 01:09:38,130
<i>by making them think we'd</i>
<i>scattered over the ocean,</i>

860
01:09:38,205 --> 01:09:40,537
<i>that Midway</i>
<i>would be a pushover.</i>

861

<i>our entire naval strength</i>
<i>at Midway.</i>

863

<i>That was our trap.</i>

<i>You men, this carrier,</i>
<i>and her escort</i>

865
01:09:50,117 --> 01:09:52,051
<i>were the bait</i>
<i>to that trap.</i>

866
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:53,552
<i>It was a nasty job.</i>

867
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:57,056
<i>It has cost us heavily</i>
<i>in men and equipment.</i>

868
01:09:57,124 --> 01:10:00,059
TheJaps thought they saw
four of our carriers

869
01:10:00,127 --> 01:10:01,560
at widely separated places.

870
01:10:01,628 --> 01:10:04,563
They only saw one.
That was us.

871
01:10:04,631 --> 01:10:07,065
Three times Tokyo
reported us sunk.

872

Twice, we nearly were,
but we're still afloat.

One is here
with the carrier <i>Soyu.</i>

885

One is here
with the carrier <i>Kaga.</i>

886
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:51,399
One is with the carrier <i>Hiru.</i>

887
01:11:51,471 --> 01:11:54,599
Now, their rear is protected
by a formation

888
01:11:54,675 --> 01:11:57,701
headed by the cruisers
<i>Mikuma</i> and <i>Mogami.</i>

889
01:11:57,778 --> 01:12:00,212
Our heavy ships
are hopelessly outnumbered.

890
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,441
TheJap fleet
mustn't be allowed

891
01:12:02,516 --> 01:12:04,381
to get
within range of them.

892
01:12:04,451 --> 01:12:07,545
The battle of Midway
must be won in the air

893
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:11,057
by this carrier's planes,
two that will join us,

894
01:12:11,124 --> 01:12:12,591
and the fortresses
on Midway.

895
01:12:14,127 --> 01:12:17,563
When theJaps find out
what they've run into,

896
01:12:17,631 --> 01:12:19,895
they're going
to come after you

with everything they've got,

898
01:12:21,468 --> 01:12:24,869
but this is the battle
we've been praying for.

899
01:12:26,306 --> 01:12:29,241

[Crash]

1130
01:33:04,576 --> 01:33:07,136
First it was Gus,

1131
01:33:07,212 --> 01:33:09,146
then Brainard,

1132
01:33:09,214 --> 01:33:11,011
then Chuck,

1133
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:13,142
and then Hans.

1134
01:33:13,218 --> 01:33:16,153
But at least he had
a fighting chance.

1135
01:33:16,221 --> 01:33:19,156
But not Oscar.
He didn't have a chance.

1136
01:33:19,224 --> 01:33:21,658
Up there,
going back and forth,

1137
01:33:21,727 --> 01:33:24,127
and nobody made an effort
to help him down.

1138
01:33:43,749 --> 01:33:46,684
Do you know
what these are?

1139
01:33:48,253 --> 01:33:49,948
They're casualty lists.

1140
01:33:51,757 --> 01:33:55,454
They're obituaries of
a long list of friends of mine.

1141
01:33:55,527 --> 01:33:58,690
Yes, friends.

1142
01:33:59,765 --> 01:34:02,700
If I seemed too tough
on the boys,

1143
01:34:02,768 --> 01:34:05,202
it was because I was
responsible for them.

1144
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:07,135
I didn't want to lose them

1145
01:34:07,205 --> 01:34:10,641
any more than I wanted to
lose those boys up there.

1146
01:34:10,709 --> 01:34:13,143
You think I wanted
to let Scott fly

1147
01:34:13,211 --> 01:34:15,145
until he dove
into the sea?

1148
01:34:15,213 --> 01:34:18,649
You think I want to dream
about them on a raft

1149
01:34:18,717 --> 01:34:20,150
until their bodies rot?

1150
01:34:20,218 --> 01:34:22,152
I'm an air officer.

1151
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:26,657
There are things I can do
and things I can't do.

1152
01:34:26,725 --> 01:34:28,659
I can check casualty lists,

1153
01:34:28,727 --> 01:34:31,662
and I can order more men
into the air

1154
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:33,163
to become new casualties.

1155
01:34:33,231 --> 01:34:36,667
I can refuse to endanger
the lives of 3,000 men

1156
01:34:36,735 --> 01:34:39,670
in order to save the lives
of three men.

1157
01:34:39,738 --> 01:34:42,172
I do those things
because they're my job,

1158
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:44,174
and I've got to do them.

1159
01:34:44,242 --> 01:34:45,675
But to be accused

1160
01:34:45,744 --> 01:34:47,678
of refusing
to save those men

1161
01:34:47,746 --> 01:34:49,714
because I didn't
want to save them--

1162
01:34:49,781 --> 01:34:52,181
[Ringing]

1163
01:34:55,754 --> 01:34:57,688
Torpedo Ready Room.
Molton speaking.

1164
01:34:58,757 --> 01:35:00,190
It's for you, sir.

1165
01:35:04,262 --> 01:35:05,194
Yes.

1166
01:35:12,204 --> 01:35:13,136
Very good.

1167
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:21,543
A destroyer picked up
Scott and his crew.

1168
01:35:21,613 --> 01:35:24,377
His radioman was lost,

1169
01:35:24,449 --> 01:35:28,146
but he and his gunner
are O.K.

1170
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:30,654
They got him!
He's back in!

1171
01:35:30,722 --> 01:35:34,158
How about that?
He's back in the ballgame.

1172
01:35:50,242 --> 01:35:51,300
Thanks, Ed.

1173
01:35:54,145 --> 01:35:55,077
Period.

1174
01:35:56,648 --> 01:35:57,580
Secure.

1175
01:36:01,753 --> 01:36:03,277
How about that?

1176
01:36:42,227 --> 01:36:44,161
Commander Harper.

1177
01:36:44,229 --> 01:36:47,164
Orders for tomorrow--

1178
01:36:47,232 --> 01:36:49,166
1 4 TBFs,

1179
01:36:49,234 --> 01:36:51,668
1 9 SB2Cs...
