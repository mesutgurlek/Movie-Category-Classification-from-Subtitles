This time, it's different.

141
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,745
Now tell me, Ragnar,
this wanderer of yours,

142
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,479
has he ever sailed west himself?

143
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,111

Now, this candle is the sun.

145
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,969
Every day, the sun rises
up into the sky until noon.

146
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,738
See how the shadow shortens?

147
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,070
At noon, it is at its shortest.

148
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,843
That only tells me
how far south I have traveled.

149
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,283
Didn't I just tell you to listen?

150
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,884
The day before sailing,
you mark a circle around the pointer

151
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,722
where the shadow is at
its shortest at noon.

152
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,627
The next day at sea,

153
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,960
you place the board
back into water around noon

154
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,466
and watch the shadow.

155
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,404
If the shadow only touches the circle...

156
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,970
Your course remains true?

157
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,365
Yes.

158
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,873
And if it passes outside
the circle, like this...

159
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,806
Then you have drifted,
and you must steer further south.

Yes.

161

And what if it never reaches the circle?

162
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:25,114
Then you are too far south,
and must steer more to the north.

163
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,680
That's it!

164
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,926
Keep the noon shadow on the circle,

165
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,725

Why don't you come in? I'm waiting.

334
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,406
Sit.

335
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:49,676
What do you want?

336
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,150
I want to know what the gods have in store.

337
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,385
For you, or for the boy?

338
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,190
I'm more interested in myself.

339
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,466
The gods desire you
to have a great future. I see that.

340
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,364
But they can withdraw
their goodwill at any time.

341
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,778
To have this great future,

342
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,209
must I challenge the law?

343
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:22,542
You must convince
the gods to alter the runes

344
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,253
so they work in your favor.

345
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,186
But the laws of men

346
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:34,121
are far below the workings
and shapings of the gods.

347
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,630
So I should take the laws of men

348
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,097
into my own hands?

349
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,711
Answer me.

350
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,206
You already have your answer.

351
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,915
No, I don't.

352
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,316
Well, then go and ask the gods yourself.

353
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,379
What are you afraid of?

354
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,329
Wait outside.

355
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,661
BJORN: All right.

356
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,129
You haven't helped me at all, ancient one.

357
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,234
Perhaps you asked the wrong questions.

358
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:42,223
LOTHBROK: We have someone
special to visit.

359
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,335
His name is Floki.

360
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,494
BJORN: "Floki"?

361
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,038
Like Loki, the god?

362
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,673
Yes, only different.

363
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,208
How is he different?

364
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,837
He's not a god.

365
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:59,344
Why didn't he come to the thing?

366
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,748
Because...

367
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,744
Because he's shy.

(SHOUTING GIBBERISH)

370
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:13,455
Floki, this is my son, Bjorn.

371
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,663
Hello. How are you?

372
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,396
Well. Thank you, sir.

373
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,932
Let me see.

374
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,974
You have your father's eyes

375
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:30,173
unfortunately.

376
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,877
Why unfortunately?

377
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,344
It means he will be like you,

378
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,184
and therefore
he will want to do better than you,

379
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,247
and you will hate him for it.

380
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,590
(SNIGGERS)

381
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:46,163
How can you tell that
by just looking at my face?

382
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,221
It's the same with trees.

383
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,164
I can tell which trees will make

384
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,668
the best planks just by looking at them.

385
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,296
(WHISPERS) I can look inside the tree.

386
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,509
Floki is a boat-builder.

387
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:01,538
Among other things.

388
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,510
This is one.

389
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,547
Inside this tree
are two almost perfect planks.

390
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,880
They will bend, then curve,

391
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,580
like a woman's body
from the thighs to the back.

392
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:47,351
When I split this tree, I will find them.

393
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,327
You can see that?

394
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,757
Do you think I'm joking?

395
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:11,340
(WHISPERS) I joke about many things,
son of Ragnar,

396
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,782
but never about ship-building.

397
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,052
Do you imagine ships are just dead things?

398
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,918
So, what about our boat?

399
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:28,495
It will be lighter and carry a bigger sail.

400
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,931
The construction is different.

401
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,969
It's built with a strong central plank.

402
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,663
The two strakes above it are nailed

403
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,000
directly onto the knees of the frame.

404
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,041
But the ones below... Look!

405
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,872
Are cleated and lashed onto the frames,
not nailed,

406
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:42,037
so they can move in relation to each other.

407
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,139
This means the boat won't butt against
the waves like a goat,

408
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,945
but move over them like a ripple.

409
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,711
LOTHBROK: The hull is deeper.
How will my men set their oars?

410
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,688
FLOKI: I will cut them
into the sheerstrakes,

411
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,987
and the ports can be closed
when the boat is at sea.

412
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,093
And you think
it could handle long sea voyages?

413
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,789
(CHUCKLES) That's why I'm building it.

414
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,126
But will it be strong enough?

415
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,030
We won't know that until we try.

416
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,142
For the anchor.

417
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:16,146
It's all I have left from
last summer's raids.

418

Don't worry.

is your mother teaching you

Yes, I know how to use a shield.

Your mother was a famous shield-maiden.

She'll sink.

501
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,119
No, she bloody won't.

502
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,021
I shouldn't have pretended
to build such a boat.

503
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,421
It's beyond my humble capabilities.

504
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,492
I'll set the sail.

505
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,457
I'm sorry, Ragnar.

506
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,263
I've wasted all your money.
It was all a joke.

507
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,063
LOTHBROK: Shut up, man.

508
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,118
Ha!

509
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,726
Now it runs on its cool keel.

510
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,300
It's beautiful.

511
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,805
Why didn't you believe me?
I told you I could do it!

512
00:42:56,941 --> 00:42:58,203
(LAUGHS)

513
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:05,075
Now it's all up to you, Ragnar Lothbrok.
