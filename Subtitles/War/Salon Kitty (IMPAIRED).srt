01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:20,229
As I did today.

[Shrieks]

957
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:28,946
[Gasping]

958
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,031
What are you staring at?

959
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:33,367
Go away while you still can!

960
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:35,870
This is a lousy life!

961
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:40,332
A life full of shit, vomit,
jizz, pricks, cunts and idiots!

962
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:44,837
Go away! All of you!
[Shrieks]

963
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:55,890
You. Especially you.

964
01:29:57,768 --> 01:30:02,188
What need have you
to be humiliated by men?

965
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:06,901
You're so beautiful, so gentle.

966
01:30:08,195 --> 01:30:10,446
Save yourself.

967
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,990
Anything is better than this.

968
01:30:14,034 --> 01:30:17,953
Save yourself.
Save yourself, Margherita.

969
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:27,797
[Moans]

970
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:36,055
How did you manage
to hide it until now?

971
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:40,684
By wearing a corset.
The men, well, they never
notice things like that.

972
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,772
But now my child shows.

973
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:49,026
You should have
informed us immediately.

974
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:52,571
Why didn't you?
I want to have the baby.

975
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:54,365
I've never heard
of anything so ridiculous.

976
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:55,950
[Woman]
It's mine.

977
01:30:57,285 --> 01:31:00,287
- And the father?
- It's mine.

978
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:03,415
Do you mean to say
you'd consider having a baby...

979
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,210
without proper state control?

980
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:11,048
Have you forgotten
that you are still an S.S. woman?
One of our auxiliaries?

981
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:13,342
It's mine.

982
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:26,981
Psychologically,
this girl is finished,

983
01:31:27,065 --> 01:31:29,441
so far as her mission
is concerned.

984
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:35,489
We can't have a whore like her
walking around.

985
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,199
She knows too much.

986
01:31:39,286 --> 01:31:41,495
Doctor, the solution
is up to you now.

987
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:44,373
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

988
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:56,302
[Screaming]

989
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:29,084
Your must be Margherita,
Hans Reiter's girl.

990
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:31,128
We were in the same squadron.

991
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:34,173
[Urinating]
He told me about you.

992
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:36,342
Yes, I know him.

993
01:32:36,426 --> 01:32:38,344
He's been here.

994
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:40,346
Do you know
he was in love with you?

995
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:43,974
It happens.
Fortunately,
he got over it quickly.

996
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:46,060
I don't think he did.

997
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:50,814
[Toilet Flushing]

998
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:01,992
That's too bad. A man should never
fall in love with a girl like me.

999
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:05,037
[Chuckles]
Why?

1000
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:07,289
I'm a whore.
Hmm.

1001
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:29,895
Where is he now?

1002
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:32,481
Don't you know?

1003
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:36,068
He was hanged
a few days after he got back.

1004
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:40,572
For defeatism
and anti-patriotism.

1005
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:44,827
Ah. There was
an S.S. report from Berlin.

1006
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:47,371
He was planning to desert.

1007
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:50,582
He was going to defect
to the enemy, the swine.

1008
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:53,043
We thought he was
a good comrade, the shit.

1009
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:56,005
In public he defended
National Socialism,

1010
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:58,966
and in private
he called us murderers.

1011
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:01,552
He was a goddamn coward.

1012
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,263
No balls.

1013
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:07,016
Fortunately, he gave himself away.

1014
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:11,979
They hanged the son of a bitch
on a meat hook.

1015
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:15,983
I got a kick out of seeing
that bastard hanging up there.
[Chuckles]

1016
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:18,068
Like a stuck pig.

1017
01:34:22,282 --> 01:34:26,368
I even had the satisfaction
of spitting on his corp--

1018

[Doorknob Rattling]
[Kitty]
Margherita! Margherita!

1019
01:34:37,964 --> 01:34:39,882
[Knocking]

1020
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:50,309
Ohh!

1021
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:18,504
Get me Wallenberg's office, please.

1022
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:25,761
Wallenberg? It's Kitty.
We've had some trouble here.

1023
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:29,098
An officer shot himself
in the shower.

1024
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:51,411
When are you
going back to Berlin?

1025
01:35:51,496 --> 01:35:53,247
I don't know, Mother.

1026
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:56,208
Darling, are you
on sick leave or what?

1027
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,878
Yes, I am.

1028
01:36:00,964 --> 01:36:03,132
A sort
of nervous breakdown.

1029
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,551
From overwork,
let us say.
[Flies Buzzing]

1030
01:36:05,635 --> 01:36:08,971
And what about them?
Do they approve?

1031
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:11,974
They? They who?

1032
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:14,143
What do you know about it?

1033
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:16,395
You don't know
what I do.

1034
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:19,439
You just noticed
that one day I left home.

1035
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:22,276
You never gave a thought
as to what my work might be.

1036
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:23,902
Well, you never gave me permission--

1037
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:27,239
[Margherita]
Neither did I give you permission
to make me join the National Socialist Party.

1038
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,324
To bear a grudge
is childish.

1039
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:31,285
I don't bear any grudge.

1040
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,744
You despise us!

1041
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:34,997
I do.

1042
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:37,332
I despise your hypocrisy,

1043
01:36:37,417 --> 01:36:40,043
your refusal to face the truth.

1044
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:42,880
You hide in silence
behind your law and order.

1045
01:36:42,964 --> 01:36:44,882
And our tradition!

1046
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:47,676
A fine tradition.
Look at yourselves.

1047
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,012
Two mummified insects.

1048
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:52,014
Why should people
like you be saved?

1049
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:55,100
Today's youth isn't concerned
about the past or the future,

1050
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:57,769
so it is up to the elders
to preserve our--
Preserve what?

1051
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:59,938
Your hide?

1052
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:01,607
Your property?
[Doorbell Rings]

1053
01:37:01,691 --> 01:37:06,069
With your eyes closed
so as not to see, not to think?

1054
01:37:06,154 --> 01:37:10,866
- A few months ago,
you sang a very different song.
- Mm-hmm.

1055
01:37:12,911 --> 01:37:16,705
- It's for you, miss.
- Who is it?

1056
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,874
Madam Kitty Kellermann!

1057
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:21,710
Kitty?

1058
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,712
[Margherita]
Tell her I'm not at home.

1059
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,756
Say you don't where I am.

1060
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:29,176
No, wait.
Show her to the winter garden.

1061
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:35,891
Margherita, what kind of work
do you do in Berlin?

1062
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:37,684
Invent something, Father.

1063
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:41,188
Whatever makes your conscience
sleep in peace.

1064
01:37:45,652 --> 01:37:47,569
[Kitty]
I understand you, darling.

1065
01:37:47,654 --> 01:37:50,030
At your age,
I would have done the same thing.

1066
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:54,368
But I can't keep
on covering for you.
Wallenberg wants you back.

1067
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:58,872
So now you're pimping for Wallenberg.

1068
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:06,129
I don't pimp for anybody,
especially not for a politician
like Wallenberg.

1069
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:10,300
But don't forget
that a German officer
was killed in your room.

1070
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:13,303
It's not only stupid
but dangerous
to fight a man like him.

1071
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:15,347
Are you blackmailing me?

1072
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:17,891
Well, I don't give a damn.
Go ahead and tell him.

1073
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:22,271
Tell him I blew his brains out.
Tell him I killed that pig to avenge Hans.

1074
01:38:23,773 --> 01:38:26,108
Did you really love him
that much?

1075
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:36,076
You don't have
to come back tomorrow
or the next day. Take your time.

1076
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:39,705
Meanwhile,
I'll try to smooth things over.

1077
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:42,666
There's nothing to smooth over.
I'm not going back.

1078
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,585
Don't bother to lie.
Write the report yourself.

1079
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:48,463
Margherita is leaving
Operation Kitty!

1080
01:38:48,589 --> 01:38:51,341
What operation?
The one that gets people
hanged on meat hooks.

1081
01:38:51,467 --> 01:38:55,220
What the hell
are you talking about?
The operation you run, Kitty.

1082
01:38:55,305 --> 01:38:58,015
The nest of spies
who drink champagne and fuck...

1083
01:38:58,099 --> 01:39:00,851
and report every secret they learn
back to Wallenberg.

1084
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:03,729
It's not true.
There's not a word of truth
in what you say.

1085
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:07,399
Stop it, Kitty.
Stop playacting with me.
I don't ask you to justify yourself.

1086
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:10,402
I don't give a fuck
if you're in partnership with Wallenberg.

1087
01:39:10,486 --> 01:39:14,865
Me? Partnership
with that S.S. captain?

1088
01:39:14,949 --> 01:39:16,867
You've all been spying.

1089
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,202
Spies! Spies! Spies!

1090
01:39:19,287 --> 01:39:24,166
In my house! In my honest,
clean, beautiful house!

1091
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:27,336
I hate you!
The whole lot of you!

1092
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:30,881
I never dirtied myself
with all that political shit.

1093
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:34,676
[Sobs]

1094
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:43,226
People can do
whatever they want in there.

1095
01:39:43,311 --> 01:39:45,604
Sex is clean.

[Sobbing]

1097
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:56,406
Now I understand everything.

1098
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:59,368
He changed the house.
He changed the girls.

1099
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:01,578
He thought he could
change Kitty too.

1100
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:05,582
But I'll show that bastard Wallenberg.
I'll get him. I'll destroy him.

1101
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:09,795
I'll go to Himmler.
I'll go to Hitler.
[Sobbing]

1102
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:12,547
And this time, I mean it.
[Sobbing]

1103
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:18,595
Forgive me, Kitty.

1104
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:20,180
Don't cry.

1105
01:40:21,391 --> 01:40:23,308
I suspected you.

1106
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:25,435
I thought you were in on it with him.

1107
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,271
Me? Oh, you idiot.

1108
01:40:28,356 --> 01:40:31,441
You must be out of your mind.
