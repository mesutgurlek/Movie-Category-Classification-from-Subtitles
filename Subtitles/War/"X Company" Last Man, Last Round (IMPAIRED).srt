2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,624
I have a proposition.
It's an informal prisoner exchange.

3
00:00:06,694 --> 00:00:09,596
It's your son Klaus,
he's in a Russian POW camp.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,699
I can have him transferred
to a Canadian POW camp.

5
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,902
<i>I need a man transferred out
of the Gestapo HQ in Paris.</i>

6
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:17,336

00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,980
- Do you remember the deal we made?
- Short and sweet. No strings.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,904
- Anyway, I don't mean to...
- No. It was nice.

11
00:00:30,983 --> 00:00:35,300
In three weeks, the Allies are mounting
an operation on the coast of France.

12
00:00:35,657 --> 00:00:39,096
You'll be recruiting Resistance on your
own until the troops land in Dieppe.

13
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:42,615
- Please don't let them take me again.
- It's all right.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,131
I'm right here, my love.

00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:16,498
How many guns on this rotation?

23
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:20,004
Eight rifles, three, four, MP-38s.

24
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:23,203
You think Major Stirling is in there?

25
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:25,652
If he survived.

26
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,657
Two years since they
were captured at Dunkirk.

27
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:31,096
None of them are going
to be in good shape.

28
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,714
If we're gonna build an army,
we've got to start somewhere.

29
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:38,649
Two watch towers. Six hundred
feet of exposed no man's land.

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,754
What about that hill?

31
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:43,863
It's not guarded.
It's covered in land mines.

32
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:45,959
So is that path.

33
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:50,503
No problem.

34
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:52,298
<i>What about a blind spot from the tower?</i>

35
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,868
- There isn't one.
- No time to tunnel under.

36
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:57,971
- Patrols?
- Twenty-four hour rotation.

37
00:01:58,005 --> 00:02:01,007
- Like a Swiss watch. No gaps.
- Efficient bastards.

38
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,343
Maybe we don't need to
break into the camp.

39
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:06,359
Prisoners are taken out on work
detail one block at a time, right?

40
00:02:06,372 --> 00:02:08,848
- Same time every day.
- An ambush?

41
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:09,888
When guards are vulnerable.

42
00:02:09,954 --> 00:02:12,282
It's not like we're liberating
the whole camp anyway.

43
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:14,425
Assuming we can get them out,
there'll be search parties.

44
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:16,656
They're not in any
condition to run for long.

45
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,472
I'll need to find a place to hide them.

46
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:20,793
I'll do more recon, map out a route.
Gather all the guns

47
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:24,370
- we have.
- What can I do?

48
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:28,101
You've been through a lot.
Just stay out of trouble.

49
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:30,243
What, am I grounded?
I do something wrong?

50
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:31,447
I didn't say you did.

51
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:33,979
- I want to help.
- And you can.

52
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:37,326
Someone needs to hold the fort.
He'll be all right.

53
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:39,946
We'll look after him.

54
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,948
I'll be fine.

You think that'll work in German?

Head of Morale Ops at the new camp

The Americans will be lucky to have you.

How's Bowmanville suit you?

118
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,525
Little more comfortable
than the Russian camp?

119
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:48,152
Why am I here?

120
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:50,630
- Did my father arrange this?
- Now, Klaus,

121
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:53,399
I can't elaborate,
for security reasons, but...

122
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,278
Our families vacationed on Lake
Constance when you were a child.

123
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:00,907
We couldn't keep you kids
out of the water that summer,

124
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:03,008
- do you remember?
- No.

This isn't the same breakfast the
other prisoners of war receive.

127
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,488
Well, Klaus, Bowmanville's good,

128
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:20,988
but it's not that good.

129
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:25,831
I don't want special treatment.

130
00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:29,511
Are you sure...

131
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:31,932
I'd like to be brought back
to the barracks.

132
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:35,374
I want to be with my brothers.

133
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:45,351
We shoot the tires.

134
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:47,386
Take out the guards.

135
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,089
With machine guns,
we won't make it 50 feet.

136
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,317
He's right. We don't have the gunpower.

137
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,100
Hey! Steady.

138
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,749

- Poor bastard.

00:08:29,654 --> 00:08:31,373
I don't think the guards did.

143
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:34,151
Eric! Eric! Come on!

144
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,836
Oy! You bloody goon!

145
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:48,455
- Whoa, whoa!
- You see what you did?

146
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:52,151
- You did this to him!
- Alfred!

147
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:54,412
What the bloody hell!

148
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:57,758
He was my brother!

149
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:03,562
You did this to him!

150
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,154
Shut your mouth!

151
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:11,236
You make one more sound,
I shoot you right there!

152
00:09:12,162 --> 00:09:14,206
Get back to work.

- Shh.

Line up!

160
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:03,823
Pretend I'm him. I'll get him covered.

161
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:06,397
He's lost his mind.

162
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,066
What's his name?

00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:17,071
Lieutenant Eric Darcy.
Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry.

00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:25,484
Francis Mather.

168
00:10:27,011 --> 00:10:29,548
- Name?
- Richard Williams.

169
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:32,190
Name?

170
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:35,079
Lieutenant Danny Simpson.
Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry.

171
00:10:35,437 --> 00:10:37,590
Get on the truck.

172
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:41,466
Name?

173
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:44,580
Lieutenant Eric Darcy.
Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry.

174
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,170
Back on the truck. Move!

175
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:56,375
- Name?
- Christopher Silker.

176
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:20,500
And you let him go?

177
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,683
- He didn't ask us?
- Why didn't you stop him?

178
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:25,436
Sorry if it didn't occur to me
that he would voluntarily run

179
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,772
- into a POW camp.
- Why would he do that?

180
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:30,784
After what he's been through?
Maybe it's not so bad.

181
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:34,223
- Yeah, how's that?
- Now we have someone on the inside.

182
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:36,521
If the prisoners know we're trying
to break them out during work detail,

183
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:39,249
we'll have a better shot.

184
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:42,186
But when we get them out,
where do we hide them?

185
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,789
I saw an abbey not far from here.

186
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:47,655
I'll go and make contact and
see if they'll take them in.

187
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,762
Are you all right?

188
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:55,278
- I'm fine.
- There was nothing you could have done.

189
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:57,401
About Alfred running?

190
00:12:57,436 --> 00:12:59,403
About René.

191
00:12:59,438 --> 00:13:03,407
Nothing any of us could have done.
So let yourself off the hook.

192
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:07,390
They got him. Doesn't mean
they're going to get Alfred.

193
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:10,085
Let's make sure they don't.

194
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:17,073
This was Eric's bunk.

195
00:13:17,156 --> 00:13:19,107
- Are you American?
- Any news from England?

196
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:20,628
He's Canadian.

197
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:23,819
And he goes by Eric Darcy now.

198
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,398
What happened to Eric?

199
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,835
His heart gave out. On work detail.

200
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:36,574
- How far are we into Europe?
- I'm sorry. It's not going well.

201
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:39,510
There is no Western front.

202
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:48,066
I am an Allied agent
and I need your help.

203
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:52,123
- Is Major George Stirling here?
- That's me.

204
00:13:58,008 --> 00:14:00,141
It's an honor to meet you.

205
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:13,153
I have colleagues on the outside,
right now, helping me plan a breakout.

206
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,613
The men who escape with me

207
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,849
will help train Resistance fighters from
here all the way to the Northern Coast.

208
00:14:18,884 --> 00:14:20,957
I'm not risking these men's lives
for anything less than a solid plan.

209
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,688
If we're gonna turn things around,
we need to do something now.

210
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:25,140
You can't just wait here to die.

211
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,692
- We're digging a tunnel.
- Danny.

212
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:31,329
You can trust me.
I broke in for you, didn't I?

213
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:37,802
- We're clearing a foot a day.
- When do you expect to finish?

214
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,675
Three months, give or take.

215
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,469
Then we're all getting out.

216
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:42,387
- We don't have that much time.
- Time 'til what?

217
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:44,916
I can't say.
But we have weeks, not months.

218
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:46,917
It's an important operation.

219
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,761
It could make the difference.

220
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:53,985
We need your most experienced men.
Your strongest,

221
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,948
to help train civilian recruits.

222
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:59,411
So what's your plan?

223
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,858
Next time on work detail

224
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:05,496
I'll give a signal.
My team will provide covering fire

225
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,165
while we break for the woods.

226
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:15,206
(bell tolling)

227
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,723
Ahh!

228
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,427
They said you told them
nothing at the gate.

229
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:38,596
You are a mystery,

230
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,371
and I am a curious person.

231
00:15:41,437 --> 00:15:42,862
Please.

232
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,789
Thank you, Sister. And you, Mother,

233
00:15:45,838 --> 00:15:48,939
for agreeing to see me.

234
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,741
I'm sorry,
but this is a personal matter.

235
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,585
Don't worry, there are no secrets here.

236
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:58,470
And, anyway, Sister Marie
has taken a vow of silence,

237
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:01,025
so there is nothing to worry about.

238
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:03,753
Please speak freely.

239
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,924
I may need your help soon.

240
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,772
And I apologize if I'm
being presumptuous, but...

241
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:14,231
this is a place of God, and...

242
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:16,233
Yes?

243
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:18,894
If there were any other place

244
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:20,362
my friends could turn, believe me...

245
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:22,160
You need us to hide some people

246
00:16:22,284 --> 00:16:25,942
who may or may not be in trouble
with the authorities?

247
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:30,606
I'm not sure that they
will be free to come.

248
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:33,684
- A very small number of them.
- Men?

249
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:36,270
Yes, but only for a short time.

250
00:16:36,766 --> 00:16:39,143
I'm so sorry. But I can't.

251
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:43,834
Mother, please! They'll be
recaptured in the woods or killed.

252
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:46,666
The Germans are very thorough.

253
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:48,721
Every inch will be searched.

254
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:52,173
These men will be found.

255
00:16:52,235 --> 00:16:55,539
When the sisters of the
Abbey St. Germain were caught

256
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:57,939
trying to hide refugees,

257
00:16:58,022 --> 00:17:01,949
only four Sisters were
left alive that night.

258
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,883
Barely. I'm so sorry.

259
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,819
I will pray for them. For you,

260
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:10,407
in this fight.

261
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,024
But I cannot let anything happen
to the Sisters in my care.

262
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,877
I understand.

263
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:18,796
Thank you.

264
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,398
You are very brave.

265
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,677
Sister Marie.

266
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,005
Please show this young lady out.

267
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,213
<i>You're sure about this?</i>

268
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,582
We've got a U-boat
Commander at Bowmanville.

269
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:40,584
Now, any intel Klaus can get from him

270
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:43,154
- will help with the big Push.
- Eyes and ears inside.

271
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,590
You think he'll turn just because
your family took a holiday years ago?

272
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,044
Well, I'm counting on your
legendary powers of persuasion, Tom.

273
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:50,308
Does he even remember you?

274
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:52,416
He was a kid. If anything,
he'll remember my boys.

275
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,905
What else can you tell me?

276
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:55,868
He's a good soldier. He's got a
bit of a chip on his shoulder

277
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,836
due to the fact that
his father's got him some privileges.

278
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,304
So he's got integrity?
Well, that doesn't help us.

279
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:03,164
He's a pilot. That could help.

280
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:05,543
Guys who work alone are
more likely to turn.

281
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:08,931
Start there while you're still
on my payroll.

282
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:10,109
You heard.

283
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,779
The Yanks had to go through me.
I said it was your call.

284
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:16,954
Good luck with Klaus.

285
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:49,808
Why are you following me?

286
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:51,989
Open your mouth,

287
00:18:52,023 --> 00:18:54,280
- or I'll open it for you.
- I don't speak unless I need to.

288
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,560
Why are you following me?

289
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:59,489
I wanted to make sure you
are who you say you are.

290
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,904
I can help your men. No more than five.

291
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:07,638
- I know a way in.
- No. No, your Abbess...

292
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,988
- She doesn't need to know.
- She said they search every inch.

293
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:10,609
We can't.

294
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,489
There are inches
Mother doesn't know about.

295
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,746
Ladies. Everything all right?

296
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,172
Yeah. This is...

297
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:19,850
Sister Marie.

298
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:23,484
- Miri.
- Since when do we bring strays home?

299
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:27,349
She's going to help hide
our men at the Abbey.

300
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:30,694
Then she should be at the Abbey.
Why is she here?

301
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:32,467
She knows our plan.

302
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:35,278
I prefer not to let
her out of our sight.

303
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,345
We'll need a car or a way
to slow the Germans down.

304
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:38,998
The Abbey has a truck.

305
00:19:39,163 --> 00:19:42,656
They take it to town on market days.
I could "borrow" the keys.

306
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:45,529
When do you need it?

307
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:57,187
Walking freely is a privilege.

308
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:59,857
- Brilliant.
- Maybe now you will think twice

309
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,498
before attacking.

310
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:07,975
Alfred's going to have to find
a way out from the inside.

311
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:11,669
- How?
- I don't know.

312
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,571
He's going to need our help. Come on.

313
00:20:14,606 --> 00:20:16,640
Get to work.

314
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,576
You'd think they'd feed you more

315
00:20:19,611 --> 00:20:21,589
if they expect you to do all this work.

316
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:24,110
That's what Eric said.

317
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,094
He always gave me half his rations.

318
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:28,326
Refused to eat them himself.

319
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,889
If he'd eaten more...

320
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:35,072
He's gone.

321
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:38,007
My team must have taken care of it.

322
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,933
We're gonna need a new plan.

323
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:46,362
- There's always Death Valley.
- No.

324
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:50,627
What's Death Valley?

325
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:59,550
That's Death Valley.

326
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:01,951
- See that door on the other side?
- Yeah.

327
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,998
It takes you to the front gate.

328
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,924
- If that's the only way...
- We're completely exposed.

329
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:10,627
Also the barbed wire,

330
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:13,797
searchlights, guard tower.

331
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:16,467
Goons can see everything from up there.

332
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:20,449
We'd be fish in a barrel.
It's out of the question.

333
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,458
<i>You need to call your people off.
We're better off with the tunnel.</i>

334
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,235
Your tunnel will take months to finish.

335
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:35,764
You could be relocated
before it's ready.

336
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:37,645
But if it works,
we can get everybody out.

337
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,939
Two hundred of you,
running around the forest?

338
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:41,658
No papers, no clothes,

339
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:43,727
no place to hide?
You'll be hunted like dogs.

340
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,263
Yeah, it's risky.

341
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:48,599
But the truth is,
we don't know how long we have left.

342
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:52,018
Eric didn't know. None of us do.

343
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:54,653
You can play it safe,

344
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:57,423
or take the chance and fight now.

345
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:59,676
These are some of the
best men I've fought with.

346
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,479
We saw thousands die at Dunkirk.

347
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:08,285
Our orders were to hold the line
to the last man. And we did.

348
00:22:08,464 --> 00:22:10,676
It was a suicide mission.

349
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:17,461
I'm not putting these men
through that again. I'm sorry.

350
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:20,162
I can't let them take that risk.

351
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:40,137
I asked to be taken to my POW.
Why I am still here?

352
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:41,967
Damn.

353
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:45,873
You know what?

354
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:51,876
I missed lunch. So, do you mind if I...?

355
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:54,224
If you're done?

356
00:22:58,484 --> 00:23:01,052
Mmm.

357
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:04,456
Luftwaffe silver clasp.

358
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,109
- Sixty missions to get one of those.
- I know what you want.

359
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:09,507
Yeah. Gravy.

360
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,227
Why would I give information
to an office boy?

361
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,067
Tell you what.

362
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:19,137
I won't pretend to know
anything about you,

363
00:23:19,171 --> 00:23:22,340
if you don't assume that you know me.

364
00:23:23,763 --> 00:23:28,806
Don't usually flash that on a first
date. You ever been shot before?

365
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,542
No.

366
00:23:30,832 --> 00:23:34,319
It's not much fun.

367
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:36,421
I was, uh,

368
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:38,990
behind enemy lines in France.

369
00:23:39,025 --> 00:23:41,745
First, it doesn't feel like anything.

370
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:43,995
Adrenaline's good that way.

371
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,965
Then,

372
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:50,802
it was burning. White hot.

373
00:23:50,836 --> 00:23:52,711
I was trying to help a family of Jews.

374
00:23:52,794 --> 00:23:55,774
Police didn't like that.

375
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,953
You know about the Jews?

376
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,412
About the Nazi Master Plan?

377
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:07,452
All those trains taking
them East every day.

378
00:24:09,455 --> 00:24:12,624
They're not being "resettled."

379
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,661
They're being exterminated.

380
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:17,935
Five thousand Jews

381
00:24:18,017 --> 00:24:20,532
per train. Ten trains

382
00:24:20,684 --> 00:24:22,668
per day.

383
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:25,094
You do the math.

384
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:30,551
Your father, he's in charge of
running the train schedules

385
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:33,940
for the German Transport Ministry,
right?

386
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:38,177
He's very good at his job.

387
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:41,546
Very efficient.

388
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,026
How'd you get captured?

389
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:56,334
My plane was shot down.

390
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,912
You survived.

391
00:24:58,015 --> 00:25:00,289
What about your crew?

392
00:25:04,422 --> 00:25:06,745
I always wanted to learn how to fly.

393
00:25:07,222 --> 00:25:09,514
Must be something up there.

394
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:12,513
Everything looking so small,

395
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:16,588
like tiny little pieces on a board game.

396
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:19,623
It's not a game. Real men,

397
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:24,232
dying every day. And I'm being
moved from camp to camp, for what?

398
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:28,421
- It doesn't make sense anymore.
- You won't eat.

399
00:25:28,566 --> 00:25:32,103
- Why are you still fighting?
- I fight for my country.

400
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:34,105
For my brothers.

401
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,007
They are all I think about.

402
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:39,851
Are they even alive?
I don't know. Because I'm...

403
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:43,314
Stuck here.

404
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,723
Yeah.

405
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:57,471
There's something here.

406
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,678
It's from my team.

407
00:26:41,677 --> 00:26:43,351
This means the new moon.

408
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:45,728
- The light.
- When's that?

409
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:49,535
- Tonight.
- And this?

410
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:52,925
It means they can only hide five men.

411
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:56,728
You and four more.

412
00:26:57,224 --> 00:27:00,055
The cutters will get us through
the barbed wire.

413
00:27:00,282 --> 00:27:02,783
It's the best chance we have.

414
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:05,202
It's your call.

415
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,923
The truck is hidden in the woods.
Aurora has the keys.

416
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:46,928
Good.

417
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,263
Gun.

418
00:27:49,942 --> 00:27:52,614
- Why would I give you a gun?
- You need help.

419
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:54,929
I can help.
(scoffing)

420
00:27:55,094 --> 00:27:56,334
What do you know about guns?

421
00:27:56,417 --> 00:28:00,344
You aim and squeeze
and your target dies.

422
00:28:00,551 --> 00:28:02,049
How do I know I can I trust you?

423
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:04,065
You don't yet.

424
00:28:20,828 --> 00:28:22,040
What's going on?

425
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:24,218
These men have experience
training soldiers.

426
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:26,744
- You changed your mind?
- They saw your gun

427
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:29,213
and your wire cutters. What can I say?

428
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:30,749
Hope is contagious.

429
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:32,237
- But Death Valley...
- We have a plan.

430
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:33,539
We, uh...

431
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:36,120
cut the phone cords and the power
to the watchtower lights first.

432
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:38,289
- Safer in the dark.
- George! Wait.

433
00:28:38,351 --> 00:28:41,844
Danny. Danny, I'm sorry, lad, but we can
only take five.

434
00:28:41,948 --> 00:28:43,146
I want to help.

435
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,296
No. Stay inside. Stay safe.

436
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:49,471
Lifted it from the guards' latrine
on cleaning duty.

437
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:50,587
What's it for?

438
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:52,571
Protection.

439
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:55,073
I won't allow it.

440
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:57,493
Don't do anything daft, Danny.

441
00:28:57,741 --> 00:29:00,221
How long does it take the guards
to reach the far side?

442
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:01,440
Two minutes.

443
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:04,664
OK, then. Two minutes from now,

444
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:06,684
we run.

445
00:29:18,142 --> 00:29:20,342
<i>Go, go, go.</i>

446
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:32,854
Cut the wire!

447
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,259
(guards shouting)

448
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:52,231
Hey! What are you doing?

449
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:56,468
(whistle)

450
00:29:56,572 --> 00:29:59,672
_

451
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:04,286
(guards yelling)

452
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,303
_

453
00:30:09,692 --> 00:30:11,111
(siren)

454
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,426
_

455
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,865
Bloody hell.

456
00:30:20,577 --> 00:30:22,404
Hey!

457
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:25,473
Hey! Stop right there! (gunshot)

458
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,106
_

459
00:30:52,168 --> 00:30:54,369
- Not bad, Sister Miri.
- Just Miri.

460
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:56,238
Good to know.

461
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,006
(gunfire)

462
00:31:00,142 --> 00:31:02,811
Come on! Quickly! Come on! Quick, quick!

463
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:05,780
Go, go, go! Faster, faster!

464
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:10,107
- Come on!
- What are they doing?

465
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,358
- We can't take them.
- They know that.

466
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:21,963
Go, go, go, go, go!

467
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:23,841
- Danny!
- Go!

468
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:25,743
Danny!

469
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:28,737
Ah!

470
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:30,972
- Danny!
- George, go!

471
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:33,341
- Up!
- I said go!

472
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,543
Go, go!

473
00:32:03,261 --> 00:32:06,207
There they are! Go!

474
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:08,009
Down the road. There's a truck!

475
00:32:09,712 --> 00:32:11,404
Go! Go!

476
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,775
Right behind you.

477
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:22,699
- Come on!
- Ah!

478
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,367
This way! Hurry!

479
00:32:33,694 --> 00:32:37,172
- Won't they search the Abbey?
- Probably.

480
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,473
Behind there. Quiet.

481
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:48,567
Hurry.

482
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:58,082
- Bread.
- Thank you.

483
00:32:59,405 --> 00:33:00,893
- Be safe.
- You too.

484
00:33:00,975 --> 00:33:04,138
We'll move you when
the search dies down.

485
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:10,205
You must go before the Abbess sees you.

486
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,876
Come. This way.

487
00:33:18,314 --> 00:33:20,582
- Never do that again.
- What?

488
00:33:20,616 --> 00:33:23,351
You broke rank. You took action

489
00:33:23,386 --> 00:33:24,670
with no plan in place.

490
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,385
You've never broken a rule
to save someone?

491
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:29,424
- Your job is to follow my orders.
- Our job is to recruit

492
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:32,394
fighters. We got what we came for.
We got lucky.

493
00:33:33,185 --> 00:33:36,798
If you want to stay on this team,
you can't be so impulsive.

494
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:41,487
- We almost lost you once.
- Is that what this is?

495
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:46,816
I survived
37 hours of Gestapo interrogation.

496
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:48,743
That wasn't luck.

497
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,646
- Don't make the same mistake twice.
- What mistake?

498
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,648
Treating me differently.

499
00:33:53,682 --> 00:33:56,551
Compromising our objective
because of what you feel.

500
00:33:56,585 --> 00:34:00,321
- Feel?
- For me?

501
00:34:04,703 --> 00:34:07,595
You have no idea.

502
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,879
Sister Miri,

503
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:15,970
thank you

504
00:34:16,005 --> 00:34:19,019
- for all your help.
- I want to come with you.

505
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:22,760
I'm not a nun. Mother's been sheltering
me here for a month while those pigs

506
00:34:22,884 --> 00:34:26,114
are out there.
My father taught me to hunt.

507
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:30,585
To be proud.
He'd be ashamed to see me now... hiding.

508
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:33,455
Please,

509
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,790
let me hunt with you.

510
00:34:39,695 --> 00:34:42,797
(laughing and talking)

511
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:03,785
You've got two more bottles of whisky
to get through before midnight.

512
00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:06,821
- That is an order.
- (all): Yes, sir!

513
00:35:10,396 --> 00:35:13,207
Nice work. You got him, Tom.

514
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,191
He's not on board with
the Fuhrer's policies.

515
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:18,666
But he is a patriot. Loves Germany,

516
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,840
loyal to his brothers-in-arms.

517
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:23,138
Dreams of victory.

518
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:25,305
I'm surprised you're considering him.

519
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:28,510
He's a good kid. You never know.

520
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:32,663
- We could get him working for us.
- He's about your son's age, isn't he?

521
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:36,050
Yes, Tom. Yes, he is.

522
00:35:36,085 --> 00:35:37,552
Sir.

523
00:35:37,954 --> 00:35:40,355
I guess this is it.

524
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,287
Guess it is.

525
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:46,842
- Stay in touch.
- I will.

526
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:54,861
Throw them out of bed at 0300.
Interrogation Training.

527
00:35:55,585 --> 00:35:57,172
The drunker the better.

528
00:35:57,206 --> 00:35:59,207
I'll see to it, sir.

529
00:36:02,111 --> 00:36:04,979
Your ticket to Virginia.

530
00:36:09,318 --> 00:36:13,388
I remember when that was you guys.
Brand new.

531
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:15,390
Excited.

532
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:17,397
Scared.

533
00:36:18,224 --> 00:36:20,415
And then half of you don't come back.

534
00:36:22,064 --> 00:36:25,667
And we lie to your families about why.

535
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:28,970
Tibor. Charlie.

536
00:36:29,205 --> 00:36:31,417
René...

537
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:35,944
I'm glad you'll be going somewhere safe.

538
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:39,981
I'm not great at goodbyes, so...

539
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,268
Safe.

540
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,112
Sitting at a desk.

541
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:51,825
Moving little pieces
across a board game.

542
00:36:52,155 --> 00:36:54,036
Tom...

543
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:10,511
(whooping and whistling)

544
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:15,748
There's something I need to tell you.

545
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:22,123
You're going back, aren't you?

546
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,769
Yeah.

547
00:37:29,131 --> 00:37:32,540
Klaus, we're gonna move
you back to Bowmanville.

548
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:36,467
And I wanted to apologize.

549
00:37:36,529 --> 00:37:40,341
You're a loyal citizen of Germany,
and I can respect that.

550
00:37:40,376 --> 00:37:43,357
Sometimes I just don't know
when to stop doing my job.

551
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:45,980
Thank you.

552
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,421
I wanted to ask...

553
00:37:48,689 --> 00:37:51,190
How are they? Ollie and Billy.

554
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:59,871
Oliver was killed last year

555
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,297
in action.

556
00:38:02,331 --> 00:38:05,502
- I'm sorry.
- And Billy...

557
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:08,664
William now...

558
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:11,873
He's missing in the Pacific.

559
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,547
I hope he will come back to you soon.

560
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:20,342
I'm sure your father wants
the same thing, Klaus,

561
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,099
and I wish I could give it to him.

562
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,918
But that's not the game, is it?

563
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:26,694
No, it isn't.

564
00:38:27,024 --> 00:38:28,926
Thank you.

565
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:30,425
For your kindness.

566
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:32,749
It's the least I could do.

567
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,463
Maybe we can talk again.

568
00:38:37,813 --> 00:38:39,901
Maybe.

569
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:57,266
- Soldiers are safe for now.
- That's great.

570
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:58,816
The Germans searched
the Abbey last night.

571
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:01,379
They didn't find them.
We shouldn't leave them there too long.

572
00:39:01,462 --> 00:39:04,308
We're gonna need a new camp.
Somewhere we can bring them longer term.

573
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:06,295
- Yeah.
- Varges is close to here.

574
00:39:06,398 --> 00:39:07,514
Varges?

575
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:09,312
Yeah, we talked about it.

576
00:39:09,457 --> 00:39:12,805
Might be a good place to recruit
more locals for the POWs to train.

577
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:14,128
Fine.

578
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:17,352
But when we get the POWs from the Abbey,
we'll take Miri too.

579
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:21,091
- Miri, the pretend nun?
- She's motivated. She can shoot.

580
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,928
And she trailed me through the woods
for a half hour before I heard her.

581
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,334
None of you can do that.

582
00:39:25,437 --> 00:39:27,731
That's all we know about her?

583
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:30,811
Everything else you can learn
while you train her.

584
00:39:31,018 --> 00:39:32,236
Brilliant.

585
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,325
Three weeks till the invasion.
Lots of time.

586
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:35,151
Speaking of which,

587
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:39,109
I've been thinking. We're working
on the attack, but without defense,

588
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:42,365
it could all be for nothing.
What do you mean?

589
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:44,148
We need to know what they know.

590
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:47,590
Which networks are blown,
who we can trust.

591
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:50,153
We don't know how much René told them.

592
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:53,481
Counter-intelligence.

593
00:39:53,522 --> 00:39:57,461
We need to protect ourselves.
Anticipate attacks.

594
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:01,624
- Track his movements. Feed him lies.
- And by "him" you mean...

595
00:40:01,748 --> 00:40:05,138
Franz Faber. He knows a lot about us.

596
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:07,371
It's time we learned more about him.

597
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,741
- We can't get anywhere near the HQ.
- No.

598
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:15,179
But maybe we can hit him closer to home.
