00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,772
In March of 1965 Che Guevara
announced to...

2
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:35,113
...his cadres at the Cuban Ministry
of Industry that he was off to...

3
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:37,453
...Camaguey to check on sugar cane
production. Within days Guevara...

4
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:38,791
...had vanished into thin air.

5
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:42,135
Speculation regarding his
whereabouts was rampant; even...

6
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,476
...his wife, Aleida, claimed not
to know where he was.

7
00:00:45,814 --> 00:00:47,820
As the pressure to explain
the disappearance mounted,

8
00:00:48,154 --> 00:00:50,161
Fidel Castro decided
to read, in public,

9
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:53,505
a letter from Che.

10
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:56,955
He who merits...

11
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:03,610
...through qualification and virtue,
the highest ranks...

12
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:09,195
...is, however, not counted...

13
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:13,107
...among the members
of our Central Committee.

14
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:15,414
And so...

15
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:21,534
...we can only explain it
by reading this letter...

16
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:25,413
...from the hand and word...

17
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:30,362
...of Comrade Ernesto Guevara.

18
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,352
A self-explanatory letter.

19
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:40,963
It says the following:

20
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:44,173
<i>Havana, Year of Agriculture.</i>

21
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:50,092
<i>Fidel, at this moment
I remember many things:</i>

22
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,968
<i>When I met you
at Maria Antonia's house...</i>

23
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:56,379
<i>...when you proposed that I come along...</i>

24
00:01:56,981 --> 00:02:00,660
<i>...all the tension
involved in the preparations.</i>

25
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,746
<i>One day they came by asking
who to notify in case of death...</i>

26
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:11,127
<i>...and the real possibility
of it struck us all.</i>

27
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:15,708
<i>Later we knew it was true...</i>

28
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:21,761
<i>...that in a real revoultion,
one either wins or dies.</i>

29
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:26,442
<i>I feel that I have
completed the part of my duty...</i>

30
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,853
<i>...that tied me to the
Cuban Revolution in its territory...</i>

31
00:02:30,857 --> 00:02:32,796
<i>...and I say farewell to you...</i>

32
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,545
<i>...to the comrades,
to your people who are now mine.</i>

33
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:41,022
<i>I formally resign my positions...</i>

34
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,765
<i>...in the leadership of the party...</i>

35
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:50,319
<i>...my post as minister, my rank of
Comandante, and my Cuban citizenship.</i>

36
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:57,341
<i>Other nations of the world summon
my modest efforts of assistance.</i>

37
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,725
<i>I can do what is denied to you by
your responsibility as Cuba's leader...</i>

38
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:05,936
<i>...and the time
has come for us to part.</i>

39
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:11,219
<i>If my last hour
arrives beneath other skies...</i>

40
00:03:11,888 --> 00:03:16,536
<i>...my last thought
will be for this people...</i>

41
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,212
<i>...and especially for you.</i>

42
00:03:54,053 --> 00:03:56,059
Let me see you without the hat.

43
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:03,951
You're the living portrait of your father.

44
00:04:07,663 --> 00:04:09,101
You have the money?

45
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,311
Yes.

46
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,334
We could wait
until things settle down.

47
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:25,721
If we don't do it now we'll have
to wait another 50 years.

48
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,363
One more.

49
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:30,904
One, two...

50
00:04:33,078 --> 00:04:34,884
...three.

51
00:04:37,024 --> 00:04:40,468
Aleidita, remember Mom and Dad
sit at the head of the table.

52
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:44,816
But since Dad's not here,
we'll give his friend Ramon the seat.

53
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,591
Here it is. Four...

54
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:50,434
...and five.

55
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,459
What is he doing?

56
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,068
I don't know.
Go see what your brother is doing.

57
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,178
Go see what your brother is doing.

58
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:04,003
Special representative
from the "O.A.S"?

59
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:08,049
Yes, the Organization of American States.

60
00:06:10,256 --> 00:06:11,527
Just a second, please.

61
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,282
There's a man who is
a special O.A.S. representative.

62
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:23,164
Organization of American States?
Yes, let him in.

63
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:30,923
-Please, come in.
-Thank you.

64
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:34,099
Mister,
may I help you with your suitcase?

65
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:35,537
No need.

66
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:54,843
I'm worried about Monje.

67
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:57,184
Why?

68
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:00,662
When I asked him about
the 20 men he promised...

69
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:06,347
...he said, "Which men?" as if I had
never talked to him.

70
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:09,423
It's okay.

71
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:22,732
Apolinar.

72
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:25,341
Serapio.

73
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:27,648
-How old are you, Serapio?
-Sixteen.

74
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:32,163
At sixteen,
a man already knows what he wants.

75
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,480
Hello. I'm Camba.

76
00:12:37,714 --> 00:12:38,784
Ramon.

77
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,375
Do you know who that man is?

78
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,147
He came with you.

79
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:50,856
The man you just shook hands with...

80
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:53,264
...is Che Guevara.

81
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,915
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

82
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,630
Could I shake his hand again?

83
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,023
-Ramon.
-Ricardo.

84
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,306
-This is Coco, Inti's brother.
-I know, I know.

85
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,982
-The Farm is under his name.
Braulio.

86
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:25,493
-How are you doing, bro?
-How are you?

87
00:14:25,827 --> 00:14:28,503
-Miguel!
-What's up?

88
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:32,382
-Urbano, how was the trip?
-Quite tough.

89
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:39,772
Rolando.

90
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,621
You're Inti?

91
00:14:44,922 --> 00:14:48,968
-It's an honor to meet you.
-The honor is mine. I'm Ramon.

92
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,650
This is our doctor Ernesto Maymura.

93
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:57,997
He's in the Bolivian Communist Party
and studied medicine in Havana.

94
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,940
-Where did you do your residency?
-At Calixo Garcia.

95
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,029
And so we fell asleep.

96
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:11,139
Do you know where we woke up?

97
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,383
-In the United States.
-In New York.

98
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:19,734
We went right in with
our Panamanian passports.

99
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:21,740
Everything was going smoothly...

100
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:25,251
...until we almost screwed it up
because we were so hungry!

101
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:30,268
Braulio says, "Let's go
over there, they have hot dogs."

102
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:34,581
So we got there, and
of course, the vendor was Dominican.

103
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:39,129
The first thing he says is,
"Oh, but you're Cuban."

104
00:15:40,132 --> 00:15:42,139
Braulio just looks at him.

105
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:47,489
He served us the hot dogs
without another word.

106
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:52,840
I made a mistake
and took the wrong flight.

107
00:15:53,174 --> 00:15:56,518
You didn't make a mistake,
you discovered something.

108
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,725
What did we discover?

109
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:04,210
If you dress an elephant as a man,
it would still make it into Bolivia.

110
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:07,219
Good one.

111
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,731
To Bolivia or anywhere else!

112
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,088
Brother!

113
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,324
Let's go.

114
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:41,596
Hello.

115
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,676
-Eustaquio.
-Welcome, Eustauqio. I'm Ramon.

116
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,187
-Salustio.
-Ramon.

117
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:52,598
-I'm Pedro.
-Ramon.

118
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:55,307
Paco.

119
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:57,280
Aniceto.

120
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:59,052
Tuma, this is Aniceto.

121
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:01,794
Carlos.

122
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,403
Tuma.

123
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,850
-Willy.
I'm Chapaco.

124
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:11,626
I'll need a few days
to learn your names.

125
00:18:46,397 --> 00:18:49,741
In the last conversation
I had with Monje...

126
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:52,282
...I made it clear that if we really
want to change this society...

127
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:54,423
...we are the ones
most capable of doing it.

128
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:57,633
That's why the party
has to support the guerilla.

129
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:03,786
Monje expressed his doubts about
the armed struggle.

130
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:07,331
He began to talk
about his love for his family.

131
00:19:07,464 --> 00:19:10,708
And here people also have children
and women that they have left behind.

132
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:14,420
That is why,
with all due respect, Ramon...

133
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:18,466
...I don't think the party
will support an armed struggle...

134
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:20,874
...much less Mario Monje.

135
00:19:23,683 --> 00:19:26,024
So I want to ask for permission
to go back to La Paz...

136
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,201
...and recruit
the best people from the party...

137
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:32,077
...to join the group.

138
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:35,722
First we have to meet Mario Monje...

139
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:37,394
...as we agreed to.

140
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:40,571
Not doing so would be inappropriate.

141
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,966
Conditions are not right for
the kind of struggle you propose.

142
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:02,307
Mario.

143
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,052
Anywhere in the world where men
are being exploited by men...

144
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,193
...conditions are right.

145
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,674
When children work in mines...

146
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:18,225
...and 50 percent of miners
don't reach 30 years of age.

147
00:20:19,027 --> 00:20:22,371
When the same miners
go on strike...

148
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,013
...to improve their wages...

149
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:30,966
...and their are massacred by the army,
are those conditions right, or not?

150
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:36,584
If infant mortality rates...

151
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,326
...are the highest in Latin America...

152
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,168
...because of lack of hospitals
and medical care...

153
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:44,877
...the situation is right for me.

154
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:49,492
If we learned something in Cuba...

155
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:54,976
...it's that a popular uprising
that isn't backed by armed struggle...

156
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:58,153
...has no chance of taking power.

157
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:05,042
When people learn that
this movement is led by a foreigner...

158
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:06,513
...they will turn their backs on you.

159
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:10,860
You will die heroically...

160
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:16,044
...but you have no hope
of achieving victory.

161
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:20,558
Then let's change
the name of Bolivia.

162
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:24,571
After all, Simon Bolivar
was a Venezuelan, right?

163
00:21:25,674 --> 00:21:27,313
Comrade Monje...

164
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:30,590
...your job and the party's job is to
make it clear to the people that Che...

165
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:34,937
...that Ramon, is a revolutionary
from the continent, not a foreigner.

166
00:21:35,941 --> 00:21:38,950
It's true.
Ramon is like Simon Bolivar.

167
00:21:39,954 --> 00:21:43,231
The party does not
endorse armed struggle.

168
00:21:43,732 --> 00:21:45,638
You are free to abandon it.

169
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,320
And you will have
our support if you do.

170
00:21:51,424 --> 00:21:56,574
If you stay, the party will no longer
pay your stipends.

171
00:21:57,878 --> 00:21:59,316
As the head
of the Communist Party here...

172
00:21:59,684 --> 00:22:01,222
...I advise you to leave with me.

173
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,765
With a mojito,
you cannot grind up the leaves.

174
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:17,407
-I know about mojitos...
-So you know you can't grind them up.

175
00:22:17,608 --> 00:22:19,714
You cannot grind the leaves.

176
00:22:29,646 --> 00:22:30,783
How are you?

177
00:22:31,787 --> 00:22:34,462
Come over.
Just a second, I'm finishing here.

178
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:36,702
Then you have to cover it.

179
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:38,809
Half an hour in the oven
with the correct temperature.

180
00:22:39,077 --> 00:22:42,855
No, I forgot something -
on top of the cream put cheese.

181
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:43,825
Cheese.

182
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:47,336
Excuse us for a second.
We need to talk.

183
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:48,239
Go ahead.

184
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,687
-Everything good?
-Yes, good.

185
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:57,536
Why did Che change
the location of the camp?

186
00:22:58,405 --> 00:23:01,214
I think he wanted
to be closer to Argentina.

187
00:23:02,084 --> 00:23:04,558
He had contacts
waiting for him in Alto Beni.

188
00:23:05,461 --> 00:23:09,809
The mines are there.
Miners are more politicized.

189
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:11,648
They support us.

190
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:16,430
Che needed somewhere
to train for six months...

191
00:23:16,831 --> 00:23:18,603
...where he wouldn't be bothered.

192
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:23,118
How is that Nanchahuazu region?

193
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:30,140
It's a very remote place.
Life is hard there.

194
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:35,056
In fact,
the few peasants who live there...

195
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:38,099
...don't trust foreigners.

196
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:44,219
The Soviets won't allow Monje
to make a deal.

197
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,025
No.

198
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:53,716
We have some money
that we want you to take to Bolivia.

199
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,896
And we need to find out if
there's anything else...

200
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:00,739
...that we need to send.

201
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:05,420
We also found a cave
which could be useful.

202
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:07,006
Good morning.

203
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:12,223
I told them that I'm going back
to La Paz today.

204
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:15,734
I'm resigning from the party.

205
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,476
My mission...

206
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:19,914
...is over.

207
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,426
-Okay.
-The jeep arrives this afternoon.

208
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,943
Why don't you stay in the camp
until the jeep arrives?

209
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:30,615
I would like to be alone.

210
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:34,194
I'll wait at the zinc house.

211
00:24:34,528 --> 00:24:35,698
Fine.

212
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:42,052
I'll return on January 10th,
with my decision made.

213
00:24:43,222 --> 00:24:45,864
Okay. Monje, we'll be here.

214
00:24:52,686 --> 00:24:56,365
Coco, find Moises Guevara.

215
00:24:56,699 --> 00:24:59,073
Tell him I want to talk to him.

216
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:03,788
We're leaving in a few days
on a training march...

217
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:08,069
...for about 20, 25 days.

218
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,547
I'll go to the mines.

219
00:25:11,915 --> 00:25:16,429
I'll be back between the 4th and
14th of Febraury.

220
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,108
I'd like to come back earlier,
but it's a Carnival season...

221
00:25:20,442 --> 00:25:23,284
...La Diablada in Oruro.

222
00:25:24,053 --> 00:25:27,063
My men will be all spread out,
it'll be difficult to gather them.

223
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:33,016
You are our primary
connection to the outside.

224
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:36,159
Your cover needs to remain intact.

225
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:39,068
You can't come back to the camp.

226
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:43,048
There may be a strike at Siglo XX.

227
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,265
And your husband?

228
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:51,207
How are things? Did you
get the trip straightened out?

229
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:55,153
I arranged everything so that
he could go study in Bulgaria.

230
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:58,230
What about Barrientos?
What happened there?

231
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:01,474
We've been in contact.

232
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:06,924
-What happened?
-I think he likes me.

233
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:09,332
I know he likes me.

234
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:14,749
-Should I try to see him again?
-Yes.

235
00:26:16,254 --> 00:26:19,766
Tania, when this thing heats up...

236
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:22,641
...your job will make the difference.

237
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,032
Here are provisions -
sugar, eggs, flour - what's needed.

238
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,365
The new employee, is he Bolivian?

239
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,639
Yes.

240
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,746
-How much do I owe you?
-No, keep your money.

241
00:26:45,114 --> 00:26:47,488
-No, keep it.
-We are neighbors now.

242
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:51,233
-Take it.
-I'm not doing this for the money.

243
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:58,089
I want to take part in your project.

244
00:26:58,757 --> 00:27:04,543
I have relatives in transportation.
You can rely on me for everything.

245
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,917
Okay?

246
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,127
Go with Tuma to see our neighbor...

247
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:15,143
And tell him wee need his help.
Involve him without offering much.

248
00:27:17,518 --> 00:27:21,363
Tell him that we'll pay
for what he carries in the jeep...

249
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,002
...and nothing else.

250
00:27:23,838 --> 00:27:24,741
Tumaini.

251
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,981
Put a little fear in him.

252
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:30,091
And explain to him that if he
betrays us he'll pay with his life.

253
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:33,736
You can drive back and forth
to town in your jeep...

254
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:37,415
...so you can buy the food we need
and we'll pay you well.

255
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:40,391
Yes, sure, whatever you want.

256
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:44,036
-Good.
-I have to tell you something.

257
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,119
In private, because it's something
I would only say to a friend.

258
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:50,925
Okay, fine.

259
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,731
You want some more?

260
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:20,319
There were two
little birds who lived in a tree.

261
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:25,502
One was quiet, the other liked to
fluff his feathers, and sing and sing.

262
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,646
One day a hunter came by.

263
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:34,297
He heard him sing,
then put him in his sights and shot.

264
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:38,243
But the other bird, the quiet one,
nothing happened to him.

265
00:28:38,611 --> 00:28:39,949
He saved his own life.

266
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:42,624
It's a nice story.

267
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,099
-It's good.
-It's good. I liked it.

268
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,439
I really liked it.
I know what you mean.

269
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,163
You junkie son of a bitch.

270
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:08,072
We'll see.

271
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:23,522
Good morning.

272
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,063
-How are you?
-Good morning.

273
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,070
This looks beautiful.

274
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,220
I see the factory is doing well.

275
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:39,172
-Good morning.
-Come with me.

276
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:44,656
Can we come in? Show me the house.

277
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,110
I see you are really busy.

278
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:58,668
Soon. I don't know when, but soon...

279
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:00,875
...we will confront the enemy.

280
00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:06,727
Our contact
with the outside will be limited.

281
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:13,716
Some of us will die, and it's
sad to see your comrades die.

282
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:18,966
Because you can't help them
with your limited resources.

283
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:22,745
Food will be scarce.

284
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:26,490
Sometimes we won't have
anything to eat.

285
00:30:29,768 --> 00:30:32,008
And if all of this weren't enough...

286
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:36,121
...we'll have to
endure the harsh weather.

287
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:40,469
By the end...

288
00:30:41,305 --> 00:30:43,679
...we will have become human waste.

289
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:46,689
That's all I can promise you.

290
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:49,029
Think it over.

291
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:55,116
You still have time to go back home.

292
00:30:55,818 --> 00:30:57,390
Afterwards it will be too late.

293
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:01,336
In closing...

294
00:31:03,643 --> 00:31:06,318
...I would like to repeat...

295
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:09,997
...what I said to Monje.

296
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:14,411
Me? I'm already here.

297
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:18,825
They would have to kill me
to get me out of here.

298
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:24,510
I will be at the side
of those who stay, until victory.

299
00:32:06,244 --> 00:32:09,220
How much corn can you
sell us right now?

300
00:32:10,424 --> 00:32:12,765
There's not even enough for us, sir.

301
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,771
At least sell us a pig.

302
00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:19,787
They're piglets, just little ones.
How am I going to sell them?

303
00:32:20,122 --> 00:32:21,794
Besides, they belong to the missus.

304
00:32:22,463 --> 00:32:25,472
How much is your pig, madam?

305
00:32:25,807 --> 00:32:28,582
I can't sell them
they're only sucklings.

306
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:31,224
I'll pay you 30,000 bolivianos.

307
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:33,832
I'm not sure.

308
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,176
How about 40,000?

309
00:32:37,344 --> 00:32:41,357
Should we sell or not?

310
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:44,199
Make it 50,000, okay?

311
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:46,038
Okay.

312
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:48,780
What conditions do they live in?

313
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,857
Very bad.

314
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,933
Do they have children?

315
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:59,849
They have six kids.
Barefoot, all full of ticks.

316
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:04,263
One of the little boys
has a badly infected eye.

317
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:06,270
How old is the peasant?

318
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:10,283
About 40, 50 years old.

319
00:33:11,386 --> 00:33:13,961
I think he's a little older, you know?

320
00:33:16,469 --> 00:33:19,579
And when you offered the money,
how did he react?

321
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:23,659
His eyes sparkled
when he saw the money.

322
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:25,665
Hello.

323
00:33:26,903 --> 00:33:28,341
Good day, Honorato.

324
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,382
Come, I want to talk to you.

325
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:47,235
We want there
to be schools for your children...

326
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:50,913
...and hospitals to take care of them...

327
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,287
...and roads to be built...

328
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:56,832
...so trucks can reach here
and you can sell your products.

329
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,109
Don't you want all these things?

330
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:03,186
Well, yes, that would be nice.

331
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:06,463
But in order to do this,
we need your help.

332
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:16,829
Two...

333
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:19,170
...and three.

334
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:20,976
Look.

335
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:25,190
You are a big man.

336
00:34:25,992 --> 00:34:26,962
May God repay you.

337
00:34:27,363 --> 00:34:30,206
-It's all right.
-May God repay you.

338
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:37,462
Okay.

339
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:41,408
-See you.
-Bye, madam.

340
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:45,588
-Goodbye.
-May God repay you.

341
00:35:57,252 --> 00:35:58,757
What are you doing?

342
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:03,505
That's communal food.

343
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,518
No one helps themselves without
being given permission to do so.

344
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,357
Understood?

345
00:36:10,728 --> 00:36:13,537
I'll let you off this one time
because you don't know the rules yet.

346
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,219
-Everything belongs to the group.
-But we're hungry.

347
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:22,901
We're all hungry, Dario.
But one can feeds six for breakfast.

348
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:36,678
There's one missing.

349
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:00,990
I have no radio coverage
with the main camp so I'm going back.

350
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:03,698
No, big guy.
You're not going anywhere.

351
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:08,280
Stay with us until six, then you
can tell Ramon how far we've gone.

352
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:10,386
No, I'm going now
while it's still light out.

353
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,393
Hey, I'm giving you an order!

354
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:15,068
Stay here until six.

355
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:20,753
-I'm leaving now.
-You're not leaving, can't you hear?

356
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:22,224
You listen to me, I'm fucking going.

357
00:37:22,425 --> 00:37:24,599
You'll have to
go through my machete first!

358
00:37:25,234 --> 00:37:26,939
-Hey!
-What's wrong with you?

359
00:37:27,374 --> 00:37:28,912
Hey, Miguel!

360
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,952
What's going on here?

361
00:37:31,922 --> 00:37:33,260
Listen, listen!

362
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:35,567
Miguel, look at me!

363
00:37:36,136 --> 00:37:37,306
Hey, you're comrades.

364
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:39,078
"Comrades" for what?
He has to follow orders!

365
00:37:39,312 --> 00:37:39,881
That's enough!

366
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:43,827
Miguel, you have to control yourself...

367
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,171
...and give orders with respect...

368
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:49,512
...like a boss.

369
00:37:51,184 --> 00:37:54,662
You cannot threaten
or hit anyone here.

370
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:57,735
That's not
permitted by the guerilla.

371
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:01,480
And you know that better than anyone.

372
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:05,493
And you...

373
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:08,034
...lied.

374
00:38:09,305 --> 00:38:13,853
Miguel never hit you with the machete handle.
He didn't even touch you.

375
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,933
The one thing I won't tolerate here...

376
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:20,608
...is a liar!

377
00:38:21,143 --> 00:38:23,350
One more incident like that, Pacho...

378
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:27,196
...and I'll send you back to Cuba
with a dishonorable discharge.

379
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:31,760
Incidents like this destroy group
morale and our readiness for combat...

380
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:34,167
...not only of you, or you...

381
00:38:34,502 --> 00:38:36,341
...but of the entire group.

382
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,691
If anyone feels weak or discouraged...

383
00:38:42,828 --> 00:38:45,036
...he shouldn't resort to such methods...

384
00:38:46,373 --> 00:38:50,119
...but should speak to the political
comissaries, to Inti or Rolando...

385
00:38:50,386 --> 00:38:52,392
...or to me...

386
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:55,469
...and we will peacefully discharge him
from the group.

387
00:39:26,402 --> 00:39:29,679
I didn't come here to work.
We should have a rifle.

388
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:37,771
Listen to me.

389
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:43,590
Ramon could be back now
in Cuba with his family...

390
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:49,074
...with many cars, enjoying comfort
everywhere he goes.

391
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:52,418
But he is here because he
wants you to have a better life...

392
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,732
...so your kids
can learn to read and write.

393
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:02,484
I'm just a baker,
I've been a slave all my life...

394
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,959
...but some day I'll be free.

395
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:13,887
Rest because
we'll be leaving at sunrise.

396
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:17,499
-We're not staying here?
-No, we need to be patient.

397
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:20,676
We are taking you to another
camp where you'll be safer.

398
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:22,849
Have you had any problems?

399
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,865
There's a neighbor that thinks
we're making cocaine.

400
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:30,574
The police have
been here twice already.

401
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,235
When's the last time
you heard from Ramon?

402
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,409
Over a week ago.

403
00:40:42,111 --> 00:40:44,084
We lost contact with the whole group.

404
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:48,331
Moises, hello!

405
00:40:53,147 --> 00:40:54,551
Who did you bring?

406
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,330
Contacts from Argentina and France.
Chino is from Peru.

407
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:03,848
Are you going back to Camiri?

408
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:05,921
I need to talk to Ramon first.

409
00:41:07,493 --> 00:41:09,666
Monje and the Party
are interfering with everything.

410
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:13,846
They even convinced the last
Bolivians that were trained in Cuba...

411
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:17,190
...not to come here and join us.

412
00:41:19,364 --> 00:41:22,273
Hey, listen.

413
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:24,046
Hey.

414
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,885
Everyone keep away from her hammock.

415
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:28,828
Whoever touches her will
be severely punished.

416
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:32,105
Listen to me, Arturo.

417
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:37,957
They are Bolivian,
and they have come to fight.

418
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:39,997
You must not disrespect them.

419
00:41:49,293 --> 00:41:54,343
I need two volunteers to go hunt
and I thought about you.

420
00:41:55,681 --> 00:42:00,162
Bring something good
because supplies are running low.

421
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:07,686
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
We'll get money for this.

422
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:25,101
Hey, that sounds like a plane.

423
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,107
Airplane!

424
00:43:29,782 --> 00:43:31,187
Come on, Ramon.

425
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:39,413
Get down, Ramon.

426
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:09,711
They caught two of Moises' men
who deserted...

427
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:11,416
...and they talked like parrots.

428
00:44:12,252 --> 00:44:14,125
Soldiers went into the zinc house.

429
00:44:14,827 --> 00:44:17,903
They seized Tania's jeep and a mule.

430
00:44:18,606 --> 00:44:20,679
-Who gave orders to move camp?
-Antonio did.

431
00:44:21,114 --> 00:44:23,120
Tell him we'll win the war with bullets.

432
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:26,631
-Bring back all to the camp.
-Okay.

433
00:44:26,966 --> 00:44:28,003
Rolando.

434
00:44:29,808 --> 00:44:31,480
Prepare an ambush.

435
00:44:38,202 --> 00:44:39,573
Was there anything in the jeep?

436
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:44,522
I had some
recordings of Fidel's speeches.

437
00:44:47,097 --> 00:44:49,572
They're going to search the jeep
which will lead them to the hotel...

438
00:44:50,374 --> 00:44:53,050
...and the hotel will lead
them to yor apartment...

439
00:44:53,886 --> 00:44:55,558
...and your apartment will
lead them to everything.

440
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,902
I couldn't trust anyone.

441
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:03,751
Every time I called
they hung up the phone on me.

442
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:10,940
-That's why I decided to bring...
-You had strict orders not to return.

443
00:45:11,944 --> 00:45:15,388
That's five years of lost work.

444
00:45:17,027 --> 00:45:18,531
Tania, five!

445
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:20,973
Give me your rifle.

446
00:45:23,414 --> 00:45:26,992
You and the visitors will leave
as soon as we prepare your trip.

447
00:46:08,258 --> 00:46:10,297
Hold your fire!

448
00:46:10,598 --> 00:46:13,307
We surrender! We surrender!

449
00:46:17,888 --> 00:46:20,564
My superiors are cowards
and don't tell us anything.

450
00:46:21,901 --> 00:46:24,844
I didn't want to be here. I swear.

451
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,683
Calm down.

452
00:46:27,386 --> 00:46:30,930
-Please don't kill me, please.
-Calm down.

453
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,545
I suffer from rheumatism, I swear.

454
00:46:35,913 --> 00:46:37,685
-Listen, no one is going to hurt you.
-And I have a bad heart.

455
00:46:39,157 --> 00:46:41,966
Don't believe a word major Plata says.
He's a liar and he's abusive.

456
00:46:42,735 --> 00:46:45,076
He sells our food to the stores
and keeps the money for himself.

457
00:46:45,744 --> 00:46:50,761
He hits people.
Look how he's crying. He's a coward.

458
00:46:51,931 --> 00:46:53,636
So what should we do with him?

459
00:46:54,138 --> 00:46:55,710
Kill him.

460
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,954
Yes, kill him.

461
00:47:01,127 --> 00:47:02,866
Put him on his side.

462
00:47:05,274 --> 00:47:08,986
-Did you give him a painkiller?
-Not yet.

463
00:47:09,822 --> 00:47:11,494
Give him some morphine.

464
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:15,406
We have commited
ourselves to a struggle...

465
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,653
...in which, whether we
like it or not, we may have to kill...

466
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:25,372
...or be killed because we are
fighting for Bolivia's freedom.

467
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:30,889
You can do it now.

468
00:47:39,082 --> 00:47:41,523
I won't be returning.
I'm quitting the army.

469
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:46,673
We hope to see you soon.

470
00:47:47,877 --> 00:47:51,455
Because we could use more
of your ammunitions and weapons.

471
00:47:57,475 --> 00:47:59,314
Long live a free Bolivia!

472
00:47:59,581 --> 00:48:01,989
Long live
the National Liberation Army!

473
00:48:11,252 --> 00:48:13,025
No one wanted to stay.

474
00:48:14,362 --> 00:48:15,566
That takes time.

475
00:49:44,016 --> 00:49:47,394
No, if you leave now
you could be arrested.

476
00:49:48,163 --> 00:49:51,674
I think you should wait
until we start our march northward.

477
00:49:52,009 --> 00:49:54,851
-You're going north?
-Yes.

478
00:49:55,854 --> 00:49:59,065
Then we can't let you off
on the Cochabamba road.

479
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,278
No. I don't think that's right.
That could take two or three months.

480
00:50:03,613 --> 00:50:05,887
Ciro, we're at war.

481
00:50:07,726 --> 00:50:09,732
Give me a guide.

482
00:50:10,368 --> 00:50:12,307
Give me a guide and I'll
make the arrangements.

483
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,350
I can't break up the group
under these circumstances.

484
00:50:16,153 --> 00:50:19,029
I'll think about an alternative.

485
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:22,808
But every move we make will be made
with the group as a whole.

486
00:50:27,738 --> 00:50:30,379
Ramon, your books are soaked.

487
00:50:31,215 --> 00:50:33,757
Put them on
those rocks to dry.

488
00:50:38,004 --> 00:50:39,843
Arturo.

489
00:50:40,077 --> 00:50:42,184
Water got in the radio,
everything is rusted.

490
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:46,297
What are you saying,
that it doesn't work?

491
00:50:46,665 --> 00:50:48,772
It still recieves,
but it doesn't send.

492
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:56,396
Shit. Now we're really screwed.

493
00:50:57,767 --> 00:51:00,744
Not quite. We still have
the visitors to relay messages.

494
00:51:06,529 --> 00:51:08,100
The army says that you are
here to practice Communism.

495
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:13,117
That you have no God,
that you all work for the State.

496
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:16,628
That you rape women and
destroy families.

497
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:20,774
You kill those who refuse to serve you
and wait to make us slaves.

498
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,654
And what kind of freedom do you have?

499
00:51:25,155 --> 00:51:26,158
The kind where
I can do whatever I want.

500
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:31,007
Listen to me.
None of what they said is true.

501
00:51:31,442 --> 00:51:33,014
We haven't come to harm anybody.

502
00:51:33,683 --> 00:51:36,492
We just want to buy
some food from you, that's all.

503
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,535
But I have nothing, only this.

504
00:51:42,377 --> 00:51:43,882
How much do you want for this?

505
00:51:45,387 --> 00:51:47,728
Whatever you have - take it.

506
00:51:49,567 --> 00:51:52,510
I'll stay if you need me.

507
00:51:53,212 --> 00:51:56,589
What I need now are peasants.

508
00:51:57,292 --> 00:52:04,214
It's better if you go to France and
make a network to promote our cause...

509
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:09,297
...so they can send us money, medicine and radios.

510
00:52:11,303 --> 00:52:13,811
I'd also need you to take
some messages to Cuba.

511
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:24,011
I'll write Sartre and Bortrand Russell
to organize a worldwide fund...

512
00:52:24,512 --> 00:52:26,853
...on behalf
of the Bolivian revolution.

513
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,571
Don't worry.

514
00:52:46,073 --> 00:52:48,280
We'll take you out
of here when you recover.

515
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,427
I'm not worried.

516
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:01,890
Tumaini.

517
00:53:12,491 --> 00:53:14,163
Here, it's yours.

518
00:53:14,999 --> 00:53:16,704
To protect you.

519
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:32,020
I'll move southward with the vanguard
and take the visitors out by Muyupampa.

520
00:53:33,224 --> 00:53:36,200
I want you to stay
with the sick until we come back.

521
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,173
How long will you be gone?

522
00:53:39,076 --> 00:53:40,046
About three days.

523
00:54:20,442 --> 00:54:21,914
Rolando.

524
00:54:22,382 --> 00:54:25,391
Go with Loro to replace
Benigno and Miguel.

525
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,134
Ramon.

526
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,173
There's no one in the house.

527
00:54:30,408 --> 00:54:33,116
So leave the money with a note.

528
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:00,772
Pack up everything, we're leaving.

529
00:55:10,403 --> 00:55:13,713
Ramon.

530
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,492
There's no sign of Loro.

531
00:55:25,785 --> 00:55:27,925
That's what they've given me, Captain.

532
00:55:28,962 --> 00:55:29,798
What good is this for?

533
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:32,406
Are there any shops here?

534
00:55:34,614 --> 00:55:36,954
They took my pigs and my corn.

535
00:55:39,529 --> 00:55:42,673
You helped them
and they gave you money.

536
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,682
Now you are going
to help us eliminate them, otherwise...

537
00:55:47,488 --> 00:55:49,595
And now you are stealing
my chickens, Captain.

538
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,842
Listen to me closely,
smart ass, really pay attention.

539
00:55:54,678 --> 00:55:59,426
Let me know immediately
if the guerillas come back again.

540
00:55:59,895 --> 00:56:02,436
You have a good heart.

541
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:05,379
You'll do it.

542
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,821
Good morning.

543
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:28,312
I'm just here to write an article on the
guerilla movement in Bolivia.

544
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:33,997
Trying to confirm
the Bolivian army's rumors...

545
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:39,681
...that Che Guevara
is the leader of the group...

546
00:57:40,685 --> 00:57:43,126
...and there is a woman with him.

547
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:45,801
This guy is a Trojan horse.

548
00:57:48,644 --> 00:57:51,152
I don't want
any Cubans talking to him.

549
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:59,813
-What's up, Dario?
-Food is ready.

550
00:58:00,649 --> 00:58:03,391
Start serving. Children first.

551
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,805
Are you from Paraguay?

552
00:58:08,106 --> 00:58:11,617
Paraguay? No way, I'm from Oruro.

553
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:15,630
Okay, kids.

554
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,874
Once you are done you
have to leave, right?

555
00:58:19,376 --> 00:58:22,251
We can't leave because that
gringo owes us money.

556
00:58:22,653 --> 00:58:24,492
How much does he owe you?

557
00:58:24,826 --> 00:58:26,331
50 pesos.

558
00:58:39,674 --> 00:58:41,981
I spoke with the Englishman
about the way out.

559
00:58:44,222 --> 00:58:46,897
He says the army knows him in Camiri.

560
00:58:49,271 --> 00:58:51,244
We could get out that way.

561
00:58:52,916 --> 00:58:55,224
You are the ones
to make that decision.

562
00:58:57,264 --> 00:59:00,875
We could use our papers
to pass as reporters, no problem.

563
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:09,804
Inti will take you
up the road to Camiri.

564
00:59:11,142 --> 00:59:13,315
Try not to go through Muyupampa.

565
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:16,258
Don't get yourselves captured.

566
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:20,338
If that happens remember to
always deny my presence...

567
00:59:20,605 --> 00:59:24,518
...and the presence of all Cubans
here at each moment and at all costs.

568
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:30,370
-Do you have a cigarette?
-No, I don't.

569
00:59:30,872 --> 00:59:31,440
Goddamn it!

570
00:59:32,142 --> 00:59:35,219
Why don't you smoke?
Smoking's great.

571
00:59:35,553 --> 00:59:38,228
But I do have some tobacco.

572
00:59:38,463 --> 00:59:40,904
Thanks, brother.

573
00:59:41,904 --> 00:59:51,904
