00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,520
Marge is hiding God knows where,
Janey's in Canada.

470
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:10,640
What's she doing in Canada?

471
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,200
I sent her there because
her parents are criminals.

472
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,040
She's with Arthur.

473
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:19,600
Why the hell are you dealing heroin?
Have you lost your mind?

474
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,640
Maybe. How much do you know?

475
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,400
There was a man here this morning
named Antheil, a federal agent.

476
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,560
He asked me if I knew my daughter
was caught up in a narcotics ring.

477
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:33,080
- They're already after us.
- They've got you.

478
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,120
I've been waiting all my life to fuck up like this.

479
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,360
-You finally made the big time.
- I can't believe we did this.

480
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,600
A sense of unreality is not a legal defence.

481
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:50,960
lf Marge is safe, she'll call.

482
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,080
-Where are you going?
- Home. It's all I can do.

483
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,920
- No.
-What the fuck am I supposed to do?

484
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,520
Run. Don't ty any heroics.

485
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,000
(# Folk music continuing)

486
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,760
(Chatter)

487
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:21,760
(# Guitar playing)

488
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,520
They haven't heard from John, have they?

489
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:51,120
Oh, God.

490
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,320
Can you imagine what
Janey's going through?

491
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:59,000
- I was a kid once. I had days like that.
- Not like that.

492
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:03,200
Wait till I tell you the story of my life.
You'll eat your heart out.

493
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,000
How'd you turn out?

494
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,440
Your husband once told somebody
I was a psychopath.

495
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:12,720
That's the kind of thing he'd say.

496
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:22,120
-You think he could be right?
- It's a very imprecise term.

497
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,840
Hey, bubby.

498
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,480
Hey.

499
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,960
Come on, get him in the car.

500
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:55,800
I shot a guy in the gut one time in Nam.
It don't kill you.

501
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,760
lf l'd been there by myself,
I'd have given it to them.

502
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,160
That's what we should have done -
just given it to them.

503
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,400
- It isn't yours any more.
-Whose is it?

504
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,920
lt belongs to whoever controls it.

505
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,960
So is it yours now?

506
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:13,160
if you wanted to rip it off,
you should've done it before.

507
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:17,200
You never should've shown up with it.

508
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,120
I can see where you could be
a real pain in the ass.

509
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:24,640
Would you like me to go home?
I'd love to do that, but I can't.

510
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,320
Come on, Marge,
you and John fucked up.

511
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,360
Don't give me your regrets.

512
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,920
You think I want that shit?

513
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,560
I never moved that stuff in my life.

514
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,480
(Starter motor whirring)

515
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:44,440
Wait a minute.

516
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,840
Maybe we can sell it to them after all.

517
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,280
(Ray) Ty it again.

518
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,680
(Engine starts)

519
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,720
They offered you a deal.
We could still make one.

520
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,720
- (Engine revving)
- Shut it off.

521
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,640
We could still make a deal!

522
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:04,200
Who's we? They know what
fuck-ups we are. They've got their pride.

523
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,320
- I don't think we could pull it off.
- I think they're fuck-ups, too.

524
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,640
- They're animals. You can't deal with animals.
-Why don't we just leave it?

525
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:14,960
Buy it and just...

526
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:19,440
All my life I've been taking shit
from inferior people. No more!

527
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:21,240
Fuck 'em!

528
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,000
When I left the Marines,
I made myself a promise -

529
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,320
never again am I gonna be
fucked around by morons.

530
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:37,080
The next mother that tries to make me back off
is gonna have to live it out with me.

531
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,520
You're not playing this right.
You gotta identify with your captors,

532
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:00,280
like those guys in Korea.

533
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,920
-What did he say?
- He said, ''Where is what?''

534
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:09,360
(John yells)

535
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,240
(Moaning)

536
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,880
- That's right. OK.
- (Sobbing)

537
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,520
OK, John. Come on. Up you get. That's a boy.

538
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:25,960
Here you go. You're gonna love this.

539
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,560
(Yells)

540
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,600
What's it say?

541
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:55,120
ln danger, all that counts is going forward.

542
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,200
What else?

543
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,720
''By growing used to danger,
man can allow it to become part of him.

544
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,040
''He grows used to evil'

545
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,200
ls that what happened to John?

546
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,040
Are we gonna talk about him?

547
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,360
When you knew Johnny in the Marines,
what was he like?

548
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,080
ln some ways he was beautiful.

549
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:28,320
ln some ways he had his head up his ass.

550
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,360
Like this number here.

551
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:35,520
Drink with me.

552
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,760
-Why did you cary for him?
- Because he asked me.

553
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,280
I don't always have to have
a reason for the shit I do.

554
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,560
-Why are you taking this?
- Pain.

555
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:52,600
Bullshit. You got a habit, Marge. How much?

556
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:56,600
I don't know...

557
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:01,520
I guess I'm doing too much.

558
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,400
lt's my last one.

559
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,160
-Are we gonna stay here?
- No.

560
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:20,400
We're gonna ty and move that stuff.

561
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,960
Where is she?

562
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:29,200
Where is she, bubby?

563
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:32,240
I don't know. I swear.

564
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,640
Hey, I've seen your old lady doll. She's big.

565
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,440
Big? She's not big.

566
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:44,680
- (Man laughs)
- Let me tell you how it is, John.

567
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,920
I was humiliated in front of your wife.

568
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,560
Your friend Raymond chained me to a toilet.

569
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:54,080
The bastard thought it was funny.

570
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:57,240
You know, your old lady's
fucking that guy right now.

571
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,680
Moaning and groaning on the floor,
on the bed, upside down, sideways.

572
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,360
What's this for? You making pasta?

573
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,000
(Makes sizzling sound)

574
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:11,240
You could scald yourself, schmuck.

575
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,800
Pour it out. We'll do what I said, huh?

576
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:17,560
Leave the heat on.

577
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:20,080
(Explosions on TV)

578
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,200
Let me tell you about your pal.

579
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,520
He looked at me and there
was this little twinkle in his eye,

580
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,520
like he's thinking,
''What a schmuck this Jules is.

581
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:31,160
''What a contemptible fucking idiot'

582
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:33,760
And she helped him do it, man.

583
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,520
I hated it!

584
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,680
-Where is she?
- I don't know.

585
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,080
No? No? You sure you're not lying, John?

586
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:44,880
Lying to protect her ass, man?
You sure you're not lying?

587
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,800
(Screams)

588
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,360
(Yelling and shrieking)

589
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,440
Hicks and your old lady,
they don't give two shits about you.

590
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:58,120
They're out there having
a great time together.

591
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:02,760
Yeah, probably still laughing about
how they tied the schmuck to a toilet.

592
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,200
-Again.
- (Phone)

593
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,680
Hold it.

594
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,360
Yeah?

595
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,440
(Breathing heavily)

596
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:17,840
No, no, there's nothing.

597
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,240
OK.

598
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,080
Hey, bubby, you can go home now.

599
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,360
(Man) Hi.

600
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,480
My name's Antheil, narcotics investigation.

601
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:02,240
I was just reading your play.

602
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,880
Found it on the shelf over there.

603
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,520
I like a lot of it.

604
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:13,280
Don't like the main character, though,
this Marine, he sounds a little jellyfish.

605
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,920
I guess you're supposed to like him
because he's against the Marine Corps?

606
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,400
- Something like that.
-Why doesn't he do something?

607
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,160
I mean, go over the hill,
refuse an order? I don't know.

608
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:29,920
I couldn't sympathise with a character like that.

609
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,040
Not everyone did.

610
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:39,000
The Marine in the play,
is that supposed to be you?

611
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:40,440
No.

612
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:44,120
- Maybe a little?
- Maybe on some level.

613
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:45,760
(Antheil) Uh-huh.

614
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,760
You know what I think, on some level?

615
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,520
I think you're a cocksucker
who writes a tear-jerk play

616
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:56,160
and then smuggles in a shitload of heroin.

617
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:00,560
I deny that. No more
literary conversation until I call my lawyer.

618
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:04,920
You mean Ben O'Dell?
No commie lawyer is gonna help you now.

619
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,880
-What do you want from me?
-A little help.

620
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,360
John, did you think about who
you were cutting in on, running scag?

621
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,400
- I don't know what you mean.
- The bikers, the black guys in Oakland.

622
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,640
The Syndicate. I mean, that's nothing.

623
00:54:27,719 --> 00:54:31,880
They've got a lot of imagination
when they deal with clowns like you.

624
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,720
- I've heard the stories.
- They're all true.

625
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,000
I can feed them your ass.

626
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:41,760
I'll just let you run loose. You'll be picked off
the street in less than 24 hours.

627
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,560
You know the only one
who can help you?

628
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:48,640
- Me.
- (Chuckles)

629
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,160
(Lock clicking)

630
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,000
(# Don McLean: American Pie
playing on radio)

631
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,640
# Oh, and as I watched him on the stage

632
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:17,440
# My hands were clenched in fists of rage

633
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,800
# No angel born in hell

634
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:23,080
# Could break that Satan's spell

635
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:27,200
# And as the flames climbed high into the night

636
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,200
# To light the sacrificial rite

637
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,720
# I saw Satan laughing with delight

638
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,160
# The day... #

639
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:36,880
Hi, Eddie.

640
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:40,120
What are you saying? What do you need?

641
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:45,080
I fell into something.
I thought l'd look you up.

642
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:47,440
Yeah? Good for you.

643
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:51,280
Can we talk? I got something for you.

644
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,640
# This'll be the day that I die... #

645
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:55,640
(Laughs)

646
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,960
Ray, you fucker!
How come I didn't know you, man?

647
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:01,200
lt's been some time.

648
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,280
I want to move some scag.

649
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,080
(Exhales sharply)

650
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:09,440
You know what I mean?

651
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:11,480
I don't see any problems.

652
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:15,080
What's life without a dream, Raymond?

653
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,360
(Antheil) No.

654
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,720
Just run the name Ray Hicks
through the computer

655
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,560
and give me evemhing that comes up.

656
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,280
No, forget that one,
I want the APB on the Land Rover.

657
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,640
There can't be more than 20 of them registered.

658
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:39,720
lt's easy to spot, it's a very distinctive vehicle.

659
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,360
I don't know. Ty Washington.

660
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,720
Right. Let me know.

661
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,520
-Who are those guys?
-Witnesses. Helping me in the investigation.

662
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:58,800
Tell me about your charming wife.

663
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,160
She's 30 years old,
she's half-lrish and half-Jewish.

664
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:07,200
Don't get smart,
I want to know how to deal with her.

665
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,640
ls she likely to burn her husband
and split with a boyfriend?

666
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:13,760
Or the victim of circumstance?

667
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,480
if you want to know,
I think she's pretty moral, basically.

668
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,080
Pretty moral, basically?

669
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:23,560
Oh, Jesus. What a couple of yo-yos.

670
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,800
You're in a lot of trouble, my friend.
So's your crazy old lady.

671
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,760
if you help us, maybe I can let you walk.

672
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,080
Both of you.

673
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:37,480
-You want me to help?
- That's right.

674
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:40,440
-What if I refuse?
- If you refuse?

675
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,560
Well, there's always your little girl.

676
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,080
What is it? Janey?

677
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,960
What do you want me to do?

678
00:57:57,039 --> 00:57:59,240
I'll let you know.

679
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:02,400
Our little friend in Saigon
told me you were nuts.

680
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,240
- She didn't tell me the half of it.
- Friend?

681
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,080
Charmian. We go back a long way.

682
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,200
Even a dipstick like you
should have figured that out.

683
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,080
I'll let you know, John.

684
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,040
I'll sell you a key for 20.
I'll give you a rate for two.

685
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:27,360
(Eddie) This comes as a complete surprise to me.

686
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,240
Not the sort of thing
I'd have expected from you.

687
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,800
But that's the fucking war for you.

688
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,800
You're going to approach
a group of responsible people.

689
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,320
You want to sell scag to the film industry?

690
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,720
A dealer with a clientele like that?
It's perFect for him.

691
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,200
Jesus, Ray. You're here
in the big town with all that shit.

692
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,720
Doesn't it make your heart go pitty-pat?

693
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,240
I'd be scared, man.

694
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:01,080
-Am I talking to the right person, Eddie?
-Am I God, Ray? How would I know?

695
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:06,800
Look at those kids. ''l want it, I want it'

696
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,600
I should steal for evey creep in town.
''Do this, do that, Eddie.

697
00:59:10,679 --> 00:59:14,680
''I'm sitting on top of all this shit, Eddie.
Please lay it off for me'

698
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,560
- If you want to, say yes. If not, say no.
-All right.

699
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:20,600
I got some ideas in this.

700
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:25,920
I've been associated with this guy.
He's English, he used to be a masseur.

701
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,480
He has a lot of goofs he works.
He knows what everybody likes.

702
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:31,920
He might be the one.

703
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,040
No intrigues, Eddie.

704
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,640
Paranoia, Raymond.

705
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:41,000
Whatever.

706
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,320
I'll put you in touch.

707
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,440
- How about tonight?
- Tonight?

708
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:54,360
Man, you must be desperate.

709
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,840
How's your friend?

710
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:25,600
lf I was smart, I wouldn't even know him.

711
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:27,880
Are we scared?

712
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,520
We don't know the meaning of scared.

713
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,760
Did you eat anything?

714
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:50,240
You want to call your kid?
They can't trace one phone call.

715
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:52,600
Sure.

716
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:56,640
I'll call her and say,
''Hi, honey, this is your mommy.

717
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:01,400
''She loves you very much
but she has to go bye-bye'

718
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,280
I know all about that call.

719
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:09,040
I can handle the rest of it.

720
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,640
lt's just what's in my head
and it's so gruesome.

721
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:15,280
(Sobbing)

722
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,120
OK. We're going to get you high.

723
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:32,000
- Don't joke with me.
- I'm not joking. Come on.

724
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,280
(Ray) I don't know much about
that stuff you're taking,

725
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,880
so I don't know what your tolerance is.

726
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,720
You snort it like coke.

727
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,760
Let's see if you can get off.

728
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,840
Go ahead and hit the other one.

729
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,800
All right, all right. OK, come on.

730
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,400
(Moans)

731
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,720
- Better than a week in the county, right?
- Hmm.

732
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:52,160
lt's a lot better
than a week in the county.

733
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:56,920
Oh...

734
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:00,760
Oh, it's good.

735
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:05,240
Oh, right in the head.

736
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:09,800
Ah, jeez.

737
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,320
lt does funny little things to you.

738
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,480
Do you remember last night?

739
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,560
Mmm.

740
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:26,760
I remember evemhing

741
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,880
with absolute clarity
since you walked in on me.

742
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,560
Not one funny little thing slips by me.

743
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:42,600
Do you believe me?

744
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:47,360
What can I do? I got to believe you.

745
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,520
Ahh...

746
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,480
You know, I was really strung out there.

747
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,480
Don't brag about it,
it's not such a tough condition.

748
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,400
This isn't what you want, not really.

749
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,240
Maybe it is.

750
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,320
lt's simpler than life.

751
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:40,520
I'll call Eddie.

752
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:42,560
Whatever's right.

753
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,240
(Whistling tune)

754
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:01,960
(Makes crashing noise)

755
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,920
Check and mate.

756
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,560
Where the fuck did that come from?
I didn't even see that!

757
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,720
You got me.

758
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,440
You stupid little bastard!
You better learn how to play the game.

759
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:25,280
-You hit my fucking bridge, man.
- Tough tit!

760
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:28,280
Why don't you read a goddamn chess book?

761
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,880
I hate jailbird chess, I hate the style!

762
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,880
Like a goddamn little tweety bird,
''Oh, here's a move' It's fucking degrading.

763
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,400
Plenty of guys will belt you when they lose.
Fucking Danskin, he wins and he hits you.

764
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,920
Where do you think I learned how to play?
I learned it in the slammer, man!

765
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,960
I can't help that!

766
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,280
- (Doorbell)
- (# Sitar music playing)

767
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,120
Hello there.

768
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:00,640
You brought your samples with you?

769
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:03,960
Did you make your contact?

770
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:06,240
Who are you? A schoolteacher?

771
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,560
lt's the big dealer!
And the woman of mystery!

772
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:16,440
Well, come on in and say hello.

773
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,320
Oh!

774
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,160
Who the hell are you, Raymond? Buffalo Bill?

775
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:26,440
You're going to love this guy.

776
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,320
- Is that the Englishman?
- Patience.

777
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,480
Our hosts are the nicest folks
you'd ever want to meet.

778
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,160
Gerald and Jody, this is Raymond and, er...

779
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:42,000
- Marge.
- Marge.

780
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:44,160
(Both) Hello.

781
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:47,440
Sit down.

782
01:06:48,519 --> 01:06:50,440
ls that the Englishman?

783
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:53,080
Gerald is a writer.
And a hell of a writer at that.

784
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:55,560
Gerald, explain yourself to the man.

785
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:57,600
This may not be easy.

786
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:02,600
(Gerald) I've been fooling around
with a project that concerns drugs.

787
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:08,200
I've done dope like a lot of people have
and I've had some beautiful things on acid.

788
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,080
Excuse me.
I want a word with your friend.

789
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,600
-Wait for me.
- It's all right.

790
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:22,520
Oh, please. Come, sit down.

791
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:24,680
(Gerald) Would you like some Chablis?

792
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:31,760
-What is this shit?
- He wants to cop, I thought you'd be amused.

793
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,520
- I don't want this insanity.
- Then you're stupid.

794
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:38,800
What you got to sell is a no-no here.
For 6,OOO, I'll take it off your hands.

795
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,600
But you can screw Gerald for a lot more.

796
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:45,680
-You'll give me what?
- The guy's loaded, his wife's an heiress.

797
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,000
-You said 6,OOO?
- Take it easy.

798
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,920
I'll burn it before I take a fucking like this.

799
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,120
You'll take a fucking like you wouldn't believe.

800
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:56,320
-You're doing me, Eddie.
- Hands off.

801
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,720
Get your hands off me, cocksucker!

802
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,960
You nickel-and-dime asshole.

803
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,720
Don't you dare threaten me with violence.

804
01:08:12,679 --> 01:08:15,440
You're way out of your league here, Jack.

805
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:19,080
You're not selling grass
to college girls down here.

806
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:24,200
I'm doing you a favour.

807
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:34,040
-You're too vain, Eddie.
-You think so?

808
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,320
I can lay this off for you.
Ain't nobody else can.

809
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,520
You don't have the bread.

810
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,080
Yes, I do.

811
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:56,560
When we're finished here,
we'll take a little ride, do a little business.

812
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,440
Finish what?

813
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,440
We're going to turn Gerald on.

814
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,000
Then he's gonna do us a few favours
because we're gonna make him scared.

815
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:12,440
We're gonna put you into his life. He's gonna
want evemhing back the way it was before.

816
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,640
You like it?

817
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:31,240
Yeah, I like it, Eddie.

818
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:34,920
(# Sitar music continues)

819
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,280
Now this is what I call
narcotics paraphernalia, Eddie.

820
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:46,640
I got better than that, sweetheart.

821
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,360
I got some coke to run with it.

822
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:55,920
Ed's my absolute picture of the operator.

823
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:00,520
Mine, too.

824
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,040
Raymond's the operator, not me.

825
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:11,920
- Is Ed an addict, Gerald?
- I don't know.

826
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,640
- I didn't know he was an addict.
-Yeah, Ed's an addict.

827
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,640
-Ain't you, Ed?
- None of your fucking business.

828
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,680
(Eddie) Shit, man.

829
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,880
Ah, shit... Ay, ay, ay, Chihuahua!

830
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:54,520
- Is it Mexican?
- (Eddie laughing) Is it Mexican?

831
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,360
She wants to know if it's Mexican.

832
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:03,200
-Who's next?
-What about me?

833
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:05,400
lt's got to be you.

834
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,800
- Unless you'd like to go first, Gerald.
- There's no reason you shouldn't.

835
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,160
Now, you give me someplace nice.

836
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:18,000
Gerald, I'm gonna take her pants off.

837
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:21,000
- Does he know what he's doing?
- Mm-hm.

838
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,200
Bend down. That's real pretty.

839
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:27,480
Be careful.

840
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:30,640
- Ow!
- (Eddie) That's a pretty girl.

841
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,080
Ow!

842
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,960
- Does that feel good?
- No, it doesn't... That's enough!

843
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,440
(Shrieking) Eddie, stop it!

844
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,200
(Shrieks)

845
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:49,760
Raymond, you got to do the rest now.

846
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,760
I gotta goof.

847
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,200
(Giggling)

848
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,160
(Jody moaning)

849
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,240
(Ray) OK.

850
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:12,800
- Should I take my pants down?
-You don't have to. Sit down.

851
01:12:17,039 --> 01:12:19,560
(Eddie) Don't hit him in a vein, Raymond.

852
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:24,200
Eddie, I'm not going to hit him
in a vein, man.

853
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:26,360
(Moaning)

854
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:30,640
Don't look.

855
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,760
Oh, my God.

856
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,360
-Ah! Eddie! Help! My God!
- Eddie, it's a vein!

857
01:12:38,439 --> 01:12:41,120
Raymond! Come on, Ray.

858
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:44,280
What are you doing, man?
We talked about the vein.

859
01:12:44,359 --> 01:12:46,800
(Whimpering)

860
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:53,320
Hustling little creep,
Iet me see you hustle now.

861
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:56,240
-What are you doing?
-Why did you do it?

862
01:12:57,479 --> 01:13:00,480
Too vain, Eddie. You're too vain to take a joke!

863
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,840
(Marge) Oh, God, Ray.

864
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,640
-We're getting out.
-We've got to help them!

865
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,520
- Let's get out of here.
- Gerald, get up!

866
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,280
Help me! Gerald, get up.

867
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,160
Get up, Gerald, and walk, man! Get up, Gerald!

868
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:19,400
I want out of this fucking city!

869
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:24,400
Were you tying to kill him? He's just
a jerk with a dumb idea, the same as us!

870
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,120
Eddie knows what to do.
He'll pull them through.

871
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:30,280
-Why Gerald?
- Because he's a Martian!

872
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:34,600
They're all Martians!
And I'm a loyal American that fought for my flag.

873

Peace was fucking with me
and I don't take shit from Martians.

ln Vietnam, I had men that were dead
the day they hit that place.

875
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,480
ln the morning they were in Hawaii,
in the afternoon they were dead.

876
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,240
- So fuck Gerald?
- That's right, fuck Gerald.

877
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:52,320
I was pissed off, it seemed like a good idea.

878
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,560
Where are we going?

879
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,400

01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:30,800
Tell me, how do you feel about
your wife and Hicks?

936
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,840
- How do I feel about them?
-Yeah.

937
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:38,920
I feel left out.

938
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,520
What the fuck is this?
We're going to New Mexico.

939
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,560
That's right.

940
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:49,240
The land of enchantment.

941
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:52,280
When we go in,
you're gonna help us negotiate.

942
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:55,960
- Negotiate?
- Maybe we'll exchange you for the dope.

943
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:59,600
We'll improvise.
Psychodrama. You get to be the star.

944
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:02,960
I knew I wasn't looking at it right.

945
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:05,880
I was considering all the legal issues here.

946
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,080
You let me worry about that.
I'm very good in court.

947
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,760
You ready to go, fellas?

948
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,520
Wait. We're going to be
out in the back of beyond.

949
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,760
- How are we going to contact you?
- I'll be waiting for you.

950
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,600
I have a colleague there.

951
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:24,120
We've done business before.
He'll tell me when Hicks arrives.

Hup, hup, hup!

963
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,560
(Marge) What is this?

964
01:19:49,239 --> 01:19:51,120
What did you have here?

965
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:52,720
(Ray) Iron huts.

966
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:58,560
Hoedowns, celebrations,
light shows, tribal dances.

967
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:01,520
Sounds like fun.

968
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,560
No doubt about it.

(Echoing) Dieter...Dieter...

972
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,200
I've come home!

973
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,640
This is Dieter Pravda's place.

974
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,680
He's the man we need right now.

975
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:26,680
lf anybody can lay that stuff off, he can.

976
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,800
Come on, let's start walking.
The house is way up there on top.

977
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:34,160
Here, give me your hand.

978
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,760
I don't know if he's up there,
but he's never gone for long.

979
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:49,440
Anyway, Dieter doesn't care.
We can stay there forever if we want to, babe.

980
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:11,320
The Jesuits built it
in the missionary days.

981
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:15,160
They came up here
when they were hassled.

982
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:17,200
lt's kind of a retreat.

983
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,920
Dieter's had it for about ten years.

984
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:27,280
- (Marge) Jesus!
-Yeah.

985
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:38,280
(Spits) Hey, beautiful.
Come on out here a minute and talk to me.

986
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:42,560
You know what?
I put this whole system in myself.

987
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,360
-Yeah?
- See those wires?

988
01:21:45,439 --> 01:21:48,000
They run all the way down the mountain.

989
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:49,440
(Spits)

990
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,120
You can run all that stuff in the valley from here.

991
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:57,160
You know, when I came up here in '65,
there were all kinds of people here.

992
01:21:57,239 --> 01:22:00,040
Dieter hauled in a couple of tons of hardware.

993
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:05,400
He had speakers, amplifiers,
tape decks, microphones, all kinds of lights.

994
01:22:05,479 --> 01:22:10,280
Came in and said we'd got to get it all together,
hook it all up, one big circuit.

995
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:15,480
Well, I'm the only one that knows
anything about that shit so I get the job.

996
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,440
Everybody else is so ripped,

997
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,200
they couldn't change
a battery in a Jap radio.

998
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:23,360
I'm laying wire from hell to breakfast.

999
01:22:24,279 --> 01:22:26,640
Took me about four weeks.

1000
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,560
Half the time I'm so stoned,
I couldn't even talk.

1001
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,920
- But by Christ, we did it.
- (# Hank Snow: Golden Rocket)

1002
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,960
One big circuit.

1003
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:41,600
-We made this mountain boogie.
- l'd like to have seen that.

1004
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,640
Where were you?

1005
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:47,040
- Come on.
-What?

1006
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:49,000
- Come here!
- No!

1007
01:22:49,079 --> 01:22:50,960
- Come on. Come on!
- No!

1008
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:53,440
- Come on, let's go.
- (She laughs)

1009
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,760
Come on, babe, don't be scared.
I want to see you strut your stuff.

1010
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:03,840
When Dieter gets back,
we'll have a celebration.

1011
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,840
We'll have some of that old-time weirdness.

1012
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:12,400
-What are you doing?
- Come on, nobody's watching!

1013
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:15,960
Oh, why not? Fuck real life.

1014
01:23:16,039 --> 01:23:19,320
That's right. Real life don't cut no ice with us.

-Wait a minute!
-What?

1024
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,640
Sounds like a chopper.

1025
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:57,840
That's either the border patrol or a bust.

1026
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,880
That must be the main trail
going up to the house.

1027
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,200
There's another one for you.

1028
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:14,040
Several trails up there,
they're marked on the map.

1029
01:24:14,119 --> 01:24:16,800
-Which one do we take?
- That's up to you.

1030
01:24:18,199 --> 01:24:20,440
Read the map, for Christ's sake!

1031
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,960
lt's pure smack, all over the seats.

1032
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:27,520
- Maybe he can read it.
- Right. Who knows?

1033
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,040
These people may be hostile
to those creeps up there.

1034
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:33,920
They'll have knowledge about access routes.

1035
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,720
This is different from what we had envisioned.

1036
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,840
That's true.

1037
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,320
Antheil's pissed off.

1038
01:24:41,399 --> 01:24:43,640
Let me make one thing clear.

1039
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,840
Tomorrow morning
we'll have to act officially.

1040
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,200
There will be local police involvement,
regulation procedure,

1041
01:24:50,279 --> 01:24:54,720
there will be arrests
and there will be confiscations.

1042
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,120
Smitty, you get that?

1043
01:24:58,199 --> 01:25:01,280
The cops will grab the dope, right?
You'll get zip.

1044
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:03,760
Shut up, smartass.

1045
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:08,840
-We only got till morning to take it off...
- That's right.

1046
01:25:10,039 --> 01:25:11,960
You two going in with us?

1047
01:25:12,039 --> 01:25:15,160
To some extent. We'll be here to back you up.

1048
01:25:15,239 --> 01:25:17,400
Shit, you told me you had this place cased.

1049
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:20,080
I don't even know how many people he has...

1050
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:22,800
Any mishaps, just get out at first light.

1051
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,680
I'm not kidding.

1052
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,920
We're going to be all-over cops.

1053
01:25:29,479 --> 01:25:31,440
Right.

1054
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,800
Let's go.

1055
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:38,640
Antheil's not pissed off, he's scared.

1056
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:42,680
Just shut the fuck up.
Don't say a word, not one word.

1057
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:45,680
When you're supposed to talk, I'll tell you, right?

1058
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,720
Right.

1059
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,720
Hi there, fella.

1060
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,520
Seor.

1061
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,600
We're looking for
some hippies live around here.

1062
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:59,800
You know, hippies, freakos, savvy?

1063
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,520
- Guy named Ray Hicks is with them.
- Hippies?

1064
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,560
- They live up on the mountain.
- I don't know.

1065
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:08,400
-You know the way?
- I don't go there.

1066
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,920
Hold it, tamale pie.

1067
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:18,240
Going to show us the way there?

1068
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:21,000
Si, seor.

1069
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:26,480
Hey, schmuck. Chilli head.

1070
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000

(Wind chimes tinkling)

1073
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:45,680
- Is anybody coming, Sister Anne?
- (Ray) Hmm?

1074
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:48,600
You're supposed to say,

1075
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,280
''l see only the sun

1076
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:53,640
''and the grass looking green'

1077
01:26:56,039 --> 01:26:58,360
How much of that shit are you doing?

1078
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:02,640
Oh, I don't know. There's so much of it.

1079
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,080
I can see you killing time on the road

1080
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,720
but you'd better use some moderation.

1081
01:27:14,359 --> 01:27:18,040
Nobody can surprise us,
we've got the high ground here.

1082
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:24,120
We can win this one.

1083
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:29,080
You know that?

1084
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,720
Huh?

1085
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:38,200
Listen, if we can lay that stuff off,

1086
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:41,720
we'll go down to Mexico.

1087
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,760
I know some people there.

1088
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,400
Hey, maybe we'll get a boat.

1089
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,920
And who's going to be on that boat?

1090
01:27:55,399 --> 01:27:57,360
Where is that boat going to go?

1091
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:02,320
lt's going to have to be some boat.

Hmm?

1095
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,560

Shit. I knew he wanted to run.
I didn't think he'd get it on.

01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,440
Yeah. We lost Tonto.

We're in tree city. Who knows where we are?

1125
01:30:04,359 --> 01:30:06,280
What do you want us to do? Over.

1126

Don't call me an asshole.

1132
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,240
Those shots came from
a high-powered rifle.

1133
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:36,200
- Could it have been a hunter?
- No. There's going to be a bust.

1134

-We've been turned.
-Who by?

1135
01:30:40,239 --> 01:30:43,960
Eddie Peace. I should have
killed him when I had a chance.

1136
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:48,400
Go get ready to sprint. Go on.

- Mother. What a gyp, walking everywhere.

You go for this, asshole?

1139
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:01,920
I beg your pardon?

1140
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,040
You like this, trees and weirdness,
the great outdoors?

1141
01:31:06,119 --> 01:31:08,840
-Are we lost?
- I don't know yet.

1142
01:31:11,239 --> 01:31:13,040
I'll let you know when I find out.

1143
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:18,640
-Why the hell are we walking downhill?
- How the fuck do I know? You're leading.

1144
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,560
Holy shit. Phew!

- Look at that.
- Get in here. Give me that thing.

1148
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,720
- How the fuck do we get on the other side?
- How the fuck do I know?

1149
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,160
Give me the fucking thing, will you?

1150
01:31:39,239 --> 01:31:41,240

Then you tell them to produce her.

Produce her?
They're going to burn her with cigarettes.

No! Stop!

1226

Stop! I'm bringing it down.

- Please! Stop the shooting!
- Oh, wow.

1228
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:04,800
I could put one right between her eyes.

1229
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:07,520
Cut it out, cut it out.

1230
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:11,000
Hicks won't do it.

1231
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:16,600
I'll bring the stuff down, I swear it.

1232

(Danskin) No! You heard me.

Hicks brings it down.

1234
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,680
Hicks won't come down. Won't even talk to us.

1235
01:36:29,439 --> 01:36:33,920
Wife says she'll bring it down.
I don't know. They're getting foxy. Over.

1236
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,120
Can you see her?

'She's right across from me.
I could hit her with a rock

Goddamn it, what's the problem?

1239
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:48,800
All right. We'll just appeal to her finer feelings.
Let me talk to Asshole.

Yeah, he can hear you.
