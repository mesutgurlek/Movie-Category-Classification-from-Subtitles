Before we proceed any further,
hear me speak.

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,092
You are all resolved
rather to die than to famish?

13
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,595
[all] Resolved.

14
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,682
First, you know Caius Martius
is chief enemy to the people.

15
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,227
- [all murmur] We know it.
- Let us kill him.

16
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,940
And we'll have corn at our own price.

17
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:16,195
We are accounted poor citizens,
the patricians good.

18
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,489
The leanness that afflicts us,

19
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,952
the object of our misery,
our suffering, is a gain to them.

20
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,162
Aye...

21
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,333
Let us revenge this with our sticks,
ere we become rakes.

22
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,709
No more talking on it. Come!

23
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,545
Soft, soft, who comes here?

24
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,464
...friends, mine honest neighbors...

25
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,718
Worthy Senator Menenius,
one that has always loved the people.

26
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:45,057
l tell you, friends, most charitable
care have the patricians of you.

27
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,935
For your wants,
your suffering in this dearth,

28
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,771
you may as well strike
at the heavens with your staves

Suffer us to famish, and their

00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,206
What's the matter,
you dissentious rogues,

42
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:18,710
that, rubbing the poor itch of
your opinion, make yourselves scabs?

43

We have ever your good word.

44
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:27,052
He that will give good words to thee
will flatter beneath abhorring.

45
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,973
What would you have, you curs,
that like nor peace nor war?

46
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,310
The one affrights you,
the other makes you proud.

47
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,271
He that trusts to you,
where he should find you lions,

48

finds you hares, where foxes, geese.

49
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:48,657
Who deserves greatness,
deserves your hate.

50

Hang ye. Trust ye?

51
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,080
With every minute
you do change your mind,

52
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,416
and call him noble
that was now your hate,

53
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,709
him vile that was your garland.

54
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,963
What's the matter, that in these
several places of the city

55
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:08,176
you cry against the noble senate,
who, under the gods, keep you in awe,

00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,179

l know you well.

68
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,659
Your name, l think, is Aufidius.

69

lt is so.

70
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,793
- l'm a Roman.
- What's the news in Rome?

71

What's the news in Rome?

72
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,645
There hath been in Rome
strange insurrections.

- The people against the senators.
- Hath been? ls it ended then?

The main blaze of it is past,

You have ended my business.

The news is the Volsces are in arms.

78
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:55,510
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius,
that'll put you to it.

l sin in envying his nobility.

And were l anything but what l am,
l would wish me only he.

You have fought together?

82
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,149
He is a lion that l am proud to hunt.

83

Titus Lartius, thou shalt see me
once more strike at Tullus' face.

Lead you on.

85
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,968
So your opinion is, Aufidius,

86
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,679
that they of Rome
are entered in our counsels

87

lf my son were my husband,

l would more freely
rejoice in that absence

121
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,169
wherein he won honor
than in the embracements of his bed

where he would show most love.

123

When yet he was but tender-bodied
and the only son of my womb,

l, considering how honor
would become such a person,

from whence he returned,
his brows bound with oak.

128

But had he died in the business,
madam, how then?

00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,740
Then...

130

...his good report

Hear me.

133
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:47,385
l had rather eleven die
nobly for their country,

134

Heavens bless my lord

He'll beat Aufidius' head

You were got in fear,
though you were born in Rome."

Look to it. Come on!

Mend and charge home,

145
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:46,361
or, by the fires of heaven, l'll leave
the foe and make my wars on you.

His bloody brow then wiping,
forth he goes.

147

His bloody brow?
O Jupiter, no blood.

148

Away, you fool.

And how does your little son?

l thank you, sir. Well, good.

156

He'd rather play
with swords and hear a drum

- On my word, the father's son.

Come, l must have you play the idle
housewife with me this afternoon.

No, good sir, l will not out of doors.

- Not out of doors?
- She shall, she shall.

162
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,962
lndeed, no, by your patience.

163
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,007
l'll not over the threshold
till my lord return from the wars.

164
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,634
Fie, you confine yourself
most unreasonably.

165
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:55,722
- l cannot go hither.
- O you would be another Penelope.

166
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,434
Yet they say, all the yarn she spun
in Ulysses' absence

167
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,602
did but fill lthaca full of moths.

168
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,062
[chuckling]

169
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,692
No, good sir. Pardon me.
lndeed, l will not forth.

170
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,404
Go with me, and l'll tell you
excellent news of your husband.

171
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,781
No, good sir,
there can be none yet.

172
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,742
- There came news from him last night.
- [woman] lndeed?

173
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,829
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down
before the Volscian city of Carioles.

174
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,958
They nothing doubt prevailing,
and to make it brief wars.

175
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:28,796
This is true, on mine honor.
So, l pray, go out with us.

176
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:33,092
Give me excuse, good sir.
l will obey you in everything hereafter.

177
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,971
Let her alone. As she is now,
she will but disease our better mirth.

178
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,976
[rapid gunfire]

[yells]

189
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,173
- [Titus] What is become of Martius?
- Slain, sir, doubtless.

190
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,759
He is himself alone,
to answer all the city.

191
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,931
[whispers] Thou art lost, Martius.

192
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,441
[rapid gunfire in distance]

193
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,829
Who's yonder,
that does appear as he were flayed?

194
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,334
O gods! He has the stamp of Martius.

195
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:16,797
Come l too late?!

196
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,592
Aye, if you come not in the blood
of others, but mantled in your own.

197
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,765
Let me hold you in arms
as sound as when l wooed,

198
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,768
in heart as merry as when
our nuptial day was done.

199
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,936
[explosion]

200
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:34,106
There is the man of my soul's hate.
Aufidius, piercing our Romans.

201
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,025
Worthy sir, thou bleeds.

202
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,986
Thy exercise has been too violent
for a second course of fight.

203
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,031
Sir, praise me not.
My work hath not yet warmed me.

204
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,493
The blood l drop is more
medicinal than dangerous to me.

205
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,371
To Aufidius thus
l will appear and fight.

206
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,126
lf any such be here,
as it were sin to doubt,

207
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,879
that love this painting
wherein you see me smeared,

208
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,091
if any fear lesser his person
than an ill report,

209
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,552
if any think brave death
outweighs bad life,

210
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,930
and that his country
is dearer than himself,

211
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,892
let him alone, or so many so minded

212
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,313
wave thus, to express his disposition,
and follow Martius!

213
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:21,904
O... me alone.

214
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,957
Make you a sword of me!

215
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,586
[all yelling]

216
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,880
[rapid gunfire]

217
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,394
Oi!

218
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,106
[Martius] Advance, brave Titus!

219
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,819
[grunts]

220
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,529
[rapid gunfire continues]

221
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,285
Away!

222
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,510
Come! Come!

223
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:03,547
l'll fight with none but thee,
for l do hate thee.

224
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,841
We hate alike.

225
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,979
[both grunting]

226
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,279

227
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,364
[grunts, yells]

00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,637

[panting]

237
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,842
Five times, Martius,
l have fought with thee.

238
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,472
So often has thou beat me,
and would do so, l fear,

239
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,684
should we encounter as often as we eat.

240
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,939
For where l thought to crush him
in an equal force,

241
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,694
true sword to sword,
l'll potch at him some way.

242
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,655
Or wrath or craft may get him.

243
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,699
He's the devil.

244
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:02,828
[Aufidius] Bolder, though not so subtle.

245
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:11,712
Nor sleep, nor sanctuary,
being naked, sick,

246
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,798
the prayers of priests,
nor times of sacrifice

247
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,551
shall lift up their rotten
privilege and custom

248
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,054
against my hate to Martius.

249
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:27,478
Where l find him, were it at home,

250
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,648
upon my brother's guard,

251
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:36,403
even there, will l wash
my fierce hand in his heart.

252
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,366
[woman] Honorable Menenius!

253
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,161
My boy, Martius, approaches.

254
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,288
For the love of Juno, let's go.

255
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,874
ls he not wounded?
He was wont to come home wounded.

256
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,877
O yes, he is wounded.
l thank the gods for it.

257
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:55,047
O, so do l too,
if it be not too much.

258
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,216
Brings a victory in his pocket,
the wounds become him.

259
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,635
Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

260
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,805
Titus Lartius said they fought together,
but Aufidius got off.

261
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,182
ln truth, there's wondrous
things spoke of him.

262
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,642
Gods grant them true.

263
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,144
- True.
- l'll be sworn they're true.

264
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,396
Where is he wounded?

265
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,523
ln the shoulder and in the left arm.

266
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,608
There will be large
scars to show the people

267
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,568
when he shall stand for his place.

268
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,445
He had, before this last expedition,

269
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:22,157
- 25 wounds upon him.
- Now it's 27.

270
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,162
Every gash was an enemy's grave.

271
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:55,899
[quietly] Before him he carries noise,
and behind him he leaves tears.

272
00:28:56,067 --> 00:29:01,697
Death, that dark spirit,
in his nervy arm doth lie.

273
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:06,410
Which, being advanced,
declines, and then men die.

274
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,290
[cameras clicking]

275
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,131
[man] Be it known,
as to us, to all the world,

276
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,759
that Caius Martius
wears this war's garland.

277
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:25,679
And, from this time,
for what he did before Corioles,

278
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:30,142
call him, with all the applause
and clamor of the host:

279
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:36,190
"Caius Martius Coriolanus."
Bear the addition nobly ever.

280
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,944
[all] Caius Martius Coriolanus!

281
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,572
[applause]

282
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,999
No more of this. lt does offend
my heart. Pray now, no more.

283
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,376
Look, sir, your mother.

284
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:07,054
O, you have, l know, petitioned
all the gods for my prosperity.

285
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,389
Nay, my good soldier, up.

286
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,852
Ah, my gentle Martius, worthy Caius,

287
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,608
and by deed-achieving honor
newly named... What is it?

288
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,444
"Coriolanus" must l call thee?

289
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,073
But, O, thy wife...

290
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:32,579
My gracious silence, hail.

291
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,585
Wouldst thou have laughed
had l come coffined home,

292
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,587
that weeps to see me triumph?

293
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:46,343
Aye, my dear, such eyes
the widows in Corioles wear,

294
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,888
and mothers that lack sons.

295
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,562
- [Menenius] Now, the gods crown thee!
- And live you yet?

296
00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:00,107
l could weep and l could laugh.
l'm light and heavy.

297
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,317
- [laughter]
- l know not where to turn.

298
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,654
O, you are welcome home.
You are welcome all.

299
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,032
- A hundred thousand welcomes!
- Welcome all!

300
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,618
- [applause]
- Welcome, Coriolanus!

301
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,453
Welcome!

302
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:29,636
[man] 'Tis thought that
Martius shall be consul.

303
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,513
l have seen the dumb men
throng to see him,

304
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,265
and the blind to hear him speak.

305
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,143
Matrons flung gloves,
ladies and maids their scarves

306
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,895
and handkerchiefs
upon him as he passed.

307
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,230
The nobles bended as to Jove's statue.

308
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,317
And the commons made a shower
and thunder with their caps and shouts.

309
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,985
l never saw the like.

310
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,864
[man] Was ever a man
so proud as is this Martius?

311
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,490
[man 2] He has no equal.

312
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,326
When we were chosen tribunes
for the people...

313
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,787
- Marked you his lip and eyes?
- Nay, but his taunts.

314
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,957
The augurer tells me
we shall have news tonight.

315
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,043
Good or bad?

316
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,796
Not according to the prayer of
the people, for they love not Martius.

317
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,633
Nature teaches beasts
to know their friends.

318
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,016
You blame Martius for being proud?

319
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:21,521
- We do it not alone, sir.
- l know you can do very little alone.

320
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,735
You talk of pride.

321
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,948
O that you could turn your eyes
towards the napes of your necks

322
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,742
and make but an interior
survey of your good selves.

323
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,578
- O that you could.
- What then, sir?

324
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,791
Why, then you should discover
a brace of unmeriting, proud,

325
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:46,922
violent, testy politicians,
alias fools, as any in Rome.

326
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,301
Menenius, you are known
well enough too.

327
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,471
l am known to be a humorous patrician,

328
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,433
and one that loves a cup of hot wine
with not a drop of allaying water in it.

329
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,894
One that converses more
with the buttock of the night

330
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,771
than with the forehead of the morning.

331
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:07,150
What l think l utter,
and spend my malice in my breath.

332
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,236
Come, sir, come,
we know you well enough.

333
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:13,782
You know neither me,
yourselves, nor anything.

334
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,622
- You're ambitious.
- [chuckles]

335
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,083
[sighs]

336
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,252
Good e'en to your worships.

337
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,588
More of your conversation
would infect my brain.

338
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,842
- How many stand for the consulship?
- Three, they say,

339
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,261
but 'tis thought of everyone
Coriolanus will carry it.

340
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,180
That's a brave fellow,
but he is vengeance proud

341
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,682
and loves not the common people.

342
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,684
There have been many great men
that have flattered the people

343
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,060
who never loved them.

344
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,022
Therefore, for Coriolanus, neither
to care whether they love or hate him

345
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,983
manifests the true knowledge
he has in their disposition.

346
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,319
And, out of his noble carelessness,
lets them plainly see it.

347
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,990
But he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than they can render at him.

348
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,784
Now to seem to desire the malice
and displeasure of the people

349
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,954
is as bad as that which he dislikes,
to flatter them for their love.

350
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,206
Consider you what services
he has done for his country?

351
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,084
Very well. And would be content
to give him good report for it,

352
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,462
but that he pays
himself with being proud.

353
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,757
Nay, but speak not maliciously.
He hath deserve worthily of his country.

354
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,467
[clattering]

355
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,635
[paper tearing]

356
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,774
[Martius grunts softly]

357
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,942
[sighs]

358
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,577
The good senators must be visited,

359
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,829
from whom l have received
not only greetings,

360
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,248
but with them change of honors.

361
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:53,090
l have lived to see inherited
my very wishes

362
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,343
and the buildings of my fancy.

363
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,096
Only there's one thing wanting,

364
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:05,894
which l doubt not
but our Rome will cast upon thee.

365
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:10,482
Good mother, l'd rather
be their servant in my way,

366
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,359
than sway with them in theirs.

367
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,694
[door opens]

368
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,102
Coriolanus will carry it.

369
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,938
He's a worthy man. He will carry it.

370
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,773
[bell rings]

371
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,739
- All tongues speak of him.
- On the sudden, l warrant him consul.

372
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,867
Then our office may,
during his power, go asleep.

373
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,079
He cannot temperately
transport his honors

374
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,290
from where he should begin and end,
but will lose those he hath won.

375
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,085
l heard him swear,
were he to stand for consul,

376
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,628
never would he appear
in the marketplace,

377
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,005
nor showing, as the manner is,
his wounds to the people,

378
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,007
beg their stinking breaths.

379
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,469
lt was his word. lt shall be to him
then, a sure destruction.

380
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:48,473
So it must fall out to him,
or our authorities, for an end.

381
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,477
We must suggest to the people

382
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,105
in what hatred
he still hath held them.

383
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,691
Kindle their dry stubble,

384
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,360
and their blaze
shall darken him forever.

385
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,406
[low, indistinct chatter]

386
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,410
[Menenius] lt remains, as the main point
of this our after-meeting,

387
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:12,956
to gratify his noble service
that hath thus stood for his country.

388
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,293
Therefore, please you,
most grave and reverend elders,

389
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,213
to desire the present consul, and last
general in our well-found successes,

390
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:26,219
to report a little of that worthy work
performed by Caius Martius Coriolanus.

391
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,097
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [men] Aye.

392
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,395
- Nay, keep your place.
- Sit, Coriolanus.

393
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,897
Never shame to hear
what you have nobly done.

394
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,984
Your honor's pardon. l'd rather
have my wounds to heal again

395
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,612
- than hear say how l got them.
- Pray you, sit down.

396
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,740
l'd rather have one
scratch my head in the sun

397
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,074
when the alarm were struck

398
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:52,370
than idly sit to hear
my nothings monstered.

399
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,624
[murmuring]

400
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,632
- [man] Speak, good Cominius.
- [man 2] Aye, proceed.

401
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,012
The deeds of Coriolanus
should not be uttered feebly.

402
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,599
lt is held that valor
is the chiefest virtue,

403
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,351
and most dignifies the haver.

404
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,645
lf it be, the man l speak of

405
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,648
cannot in the world
be singly counterpoised.

406
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:25,487
[voice receding] At 1 6 years,
he fought beyond the mark of others.

407
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,031
When he might act
the woman in the scene,

408
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,950
he proved best man in the field.

409
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,370
[voice echoing]
And in the brunt of 1 7 battles since,

410
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,247
he lurched all swords of the garland.

411
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,626
For this last, before and in Corioles,

412
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,879
let me say l cannot speak him home.

413
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,466
He stopped the fliers,
and by his rare example,

414
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:51,554
made coward turn terror into sport,
from face to foot.

415
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:56,810
He was a thing of blood, whose every
motion was timed with dying cries.

416
00:39:56,977 --> 00:40:00,814
[voice echoing] Alone, he entered
the mortal gate of the city,

417
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,149
which he painted with shunless destiny.

418
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,235
- [low rumbling]
- Aidless came off,

419
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,153
and with a sudden re-enforcement

420
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:11,116
struck Corioles like a planet.

421
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,160
[voice receding] Until we called
both field and city ours,

422
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,539
he never stood to ease
his breast with panting.

423
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:22,669
Our spoils he kicked at,
and looked upon things precious

424
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,088
as they were the common
muck of the world.

425
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:29,092
He covets less
than misery itself would give,

426
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,511
rewards his deeds with doing them,

427
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,974
and is content to spend
the time to end it.

428
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,893
[applause]

429
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,939
[indistinct salutations]

430
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:50,613
The senate, Coriolanus,
are well pleased to make thee consul.

431
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,407
[scattered murmurs] Aye.

432
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,748
l do owe them still
my life and services.

433
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:04,335
lt then remains
that you do speak to the people.

434
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,174
l do beseech you,
let me overleap that custom,

435
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:14,053
for l cannot entreat them for my wounds'
sake to give their suffrage.

436
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,181
Please you that l may pass this doing.

437
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,602
Sir! The people must have their voices.

438
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,353
Pray you, go fit you to the custom.

439
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,064
lt is a part that l shall blush
in acting, and might well be taken

440
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,816
- from the people.
- Mark you that?

441
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,235
To brag unto them
"Thus l did, and thus!"

442
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:32,322
Show them the unaching scars
which l should hide,

443
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,450
as if l had received them
for the hire of their breath only.

444
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:44,042
To our noble consul
wish we all joy and honor!

445
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,628
[applause]

446
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,728
- [laughter]
- [applause continues over TV]

447
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,699
[Menenius] The senate, Coriolanus, are
well pleased to make thee consul!

448
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,410
[Martius] l do owe them still
my life and services.

449
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,871
[Menenius] lt then remains that
you do speak to the people.

450
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,373
[Martius] Let me overleap that custom.

451
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,291
[man] The people must have their voices.

452
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,961
Have you not known
the worthiest men have done it?

453
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,504
Custom calls me to it.

454
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,966
What custom wills,
in all things should we do it.

455
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,592
What must l say?

456
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,554
"Look, sir, my wounds.
l got them in my country's service."

457
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,890
O me, the gods!
You must not speak like that.

458
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,475
You must desire them to think upon you.

459
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,769
Think upon me?

460
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,105
Hang 'em.
l would they would forget me.

461
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,441
[siren chirping]

462
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,667
Pray you, speak to them.

463
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,253
l pray you, in wholesome manner.

464
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,381
Bid them wash their faces
and keep their teeth clean.

465
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,685
[helicopter passing overhead]

466
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,168
You know the cause, sir,
of my standing here?

467
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,129
We do, sir. Tell us
what hath brought you to it.

468
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,341
- Mine own desert.
- [woman] Your own desert?

469
00:43:56,508 --> 00:44:01,304
- Aye, but not mine own desire.
- How not your own desire?

470
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,932
No, it was never my desire
yet to trouble the poor with begging.

471
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,603
You must think, if we give you anything,
we hope to gain by you.

472
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,690
Well then, l pray,
your price of the consulship?

473
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,569
The price is to ask it kindly.

474
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,781
Kindly, sir, l pray, let me have it.

475
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:25,745
l have wounds to show you,
which shall be yours in private.

476
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,748
Your good voice, sir. What say you?

477
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:34,837
- You shall have it, worthy sir.
- A match, sir.

478
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,924
There's in all two
worthy voices begged. Adieu.

479
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,302
But this is something odd.

480
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,432
[Martius] Pray you now, if it may stand
with the tune of your voice

481
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,726
that l may be consul.

482
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:52,271
You've deserved nobly of your country,
and you've not deserved nobly.

483
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,231
[chuckles]

484
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,899
Your enigma?

485
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,986
You've been a scourge to her enemies,
you've been a rod to her friends.

486
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,447
You've not indeed loved
the common people.

487
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:06,077
You should account me the more virtuous
that l have not been common in my love.

488
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,287
We hope to find you our friend,

489
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,581
and therefore give you
our voices heartily.

490
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,668
l'll make much of your voices,
and so trouble you no further.

491
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,879
Gods give you joy, sir, heartily.

492
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,190
Your voices!

493
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,196
For your voices l have fought.

494
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,243
Watched for your voices.

495
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:52,707
For your voices
bear of wounds two dozen odd.

496
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:59,088
Battles thrice six
l have seen and heard of!

497
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:05,762
For your voices have done many things,
some less, some more.

498
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,974
Your voices!

499
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:16,689
lndeed, l would be consul.

500
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:27,283
He has done nobly, and cannot go
without any honest man's voice!

501
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,994
- [man] Aye.
- [man 2] Aye.

502
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,915
Therefore, let him be consul!

503
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,876
- Amen!
- Amen!

504
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,545
[others join in] Amen!

505
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,344
Amen!

506
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,180
[chanting]

507
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,851
- Amen!
- [chanting continues]

508
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,563
- Worthy voices!
- [chanting continues]

509
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,191
Worthy voices, worthy voices.

510
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:03,569
[chanting, cheering]

511
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,826
[Menenius] You have
stood your limitation.

512
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,539
And the tribunes now endow you
with the people's voice.

513
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,290
ls this done?

514
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,085
The custom of request
you have discharged.

515
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,795
The people do admit you,

516
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,381
and are summoned to meet anon
upon your approbation.

517
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,424
- Where? At the senate?
- There, Coriolanus.

518
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,469
- May l change these garments?
- You may, sir.

519
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,518
l'll keep you company. Will you along?

520
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,145
We stay here for the people.

521
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,899
[man] God save thee, noble consul!

522
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:48,364
[crowd chanting] Consul! Consul!
Consul! Consul! Consul! Consul!

523
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,579
How now, my masters!

524
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,373
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

525
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:03,379
Whoa, my masters! My masters!
My masters, how now!

526
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:07,258
- Have you chose this man?
- [multiple voices] Aye!

527
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:08,968
He has our voices, sir.

528
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,470
We pray the gods
he may deserve your loves.

529
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,805
[woman] Amen, sir.

530
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:17,643
To my poor, unworthy notice,
he mocked us when he begged our voices.

531
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,146
- He mocked us!
- Flouted us downright.

532
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,983
O, no, no, no,
it is his kind of speech.

533
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,943
- [scattered voices] Aye.
- He did not mock us.

534
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,446
He should have showed us
his marks of merit,

535
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,449
- wounds received for his country.
- [several shouting] Yes!

536
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,535
- Why, l'm sure, so he did.
- No, he didn't!

537
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:38,831
No, no, no! No! No!
No one saw them!

538
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,172
Was this mockery?

539
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,758
[scattered voices] Yes!

540
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,975
When he had no power, but was a petty
servant to the state, he was your enemy.

541
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:01,812
- [scattered assent]
- Ever spake against your liberties.

542
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,066
Did you perceive he did solicit
you in free contempt

543
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:09,528
when he did need your loves,
and do you think that his contempt

544
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,573
shall not be bruising to you
when he hath power to crush?

545
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,409
[scattered voices] Aye!

546
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,329
lt is not confirmed.

547
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,874
lt is not confirmed!
We may deny him yet!

548
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,585
- [murmuring]
- And will deny him!

549
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,838
l'll have 500 voices of that sound.

550
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:32,176
- [multiple voices] Yes!
- l twice 500 and their friends!

551
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,053
[crowd] Yes!

552
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,056
Get you hence instantly
and tell those friends

553
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,434
they have chose a consul that will
from them take their liberties!

554
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,728
Let them assemble,
and on a safer judgment,

555
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,647
all revoke your ignorant election.

556
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,483
Enforce his pride,
and his old hate unto you!

557
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,195
And, presently, when you have drawn
the number, repair to the senate.

558
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,739
[low, indistinct chatter]

559
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,578
Tullus Aufidius then
has assembled a new army?

560
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:00,705
He has, my lord.

561
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,999
- Saw you Aufidius?
- He's retired to Antium.

562
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,918
- Spoke he of me?
- He did, my lord.

563
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,461
How? What?

564
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,922
How often he had met you,
sword to sword.

565
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,342
That of all things upon the earth,
he hated your person most.

566
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,429
- At Antium lives he?
- At Antium.

567
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,807
l wish l had a cause to seek him there,
to oppose his hatred fully.

568
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,768
Come, Rome must know
the value of her own.

569
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,813
[low, indistinct chatter]

570
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:34,947
Behold, these are the tribunes
of the people,

571
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,741
the tongues of the common mouth.

572
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,368
- Pass no further.
- Ah? What is that?

573
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,370
lt will be dangerous to go on.
No further.

574
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,289
- What makes this change?
- The matter?

575
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,125
Hath he not passed
the nobles and the commons?

576
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,586
- Cominius, no.
- Have l had children's voices?

577
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,505
- Tribunes, give away.
- The people are incensed against him.

578
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,967
- Are these your herd?
- [Menenius] Be calm, be calm.

579
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,679
The people cry you mocked them,
and of late called them time-pleasers,

580
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,724
- flatterers, foes to nobleness.
- Why, this was known before.

581
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,101
You show too much of that
for which the people stir.

582
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,561
lf you will pass to where you are bound,

583
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,730
you must inquire your way
with a gentler spirit.

584
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:11,400
- Let's be calm.
- The people are abused, set on.

585
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,152
This was my speech,
and l'll speak it again.

586
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,989
- Not now, not now.
- [Cominius] Not in this heat, sir.

587
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:20,034
My nobler friends,
l crave their pardons.

588
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:24,205
For the mutable, rank-scented many,
let them regard me as l do not flatter,

589
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,123
and therein behold themselves.

590
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:30,836
l say again, in soothing them,
we nourish against our senate

591
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,798
the cockle of rebellion,
insolence, sedition,

592
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:37,093
which we ourselves have ploughed for,
sowed, and scattered

593
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,178
by mingling them with us,

594
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,139
the honored number
who lack not virtue, no, nor power,

595
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,766
but that which we have given to beggars!

596
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,519
- Well, no more!
- No more words, we beseech you.

597
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:49,396
You speak of the people
as if you were a god to punish,

598
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,981
not a man of their infirmity.

599
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:52,358
lt were well we let the people know it.

600
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,236
Were l as patient as the midnight sleep,
by Jove, it would be my mind!

601
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:59,240
lt is a mind that shall remain a poison
where it is, not poison any further.

602
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,243
Shall remain.
Hear you this Triton of the minnows?

603
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,620
Mark you his absolute "shall"?

604
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,705
Why should the people give one
that speaks thus their voice?

605
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:10,876
l'll give my reasons,
more worthier than their voices!

606
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:17,007
By Jove himself,
it makes the consuls base,

607
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,635
and my soul aches to know,

608
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:23,514
when two authorities are up,
neither supreme,

609
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,517
how soon confusion
may enter twixt the gap of both

610
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,227
and take the one by the other.

611
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,105
Thus we debase
the nature of our seats

612
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,984
and make the rabble call our cares
fears, which will, in time,

613
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,944
break open the locks of the senate,

614
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,446
and bring in the crows
to peck the eagles!

615
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,991
- Come, enough!
- Enough, with over-measure.

616
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,411
He has spoken like a traitor,
and shall answer as traitors do!

617
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,830
Thou wretch,
despite overwhelm thee!

618
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,875
- Manifest treason!
- This is a consul? No!

619
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,626
Seize him!

620
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,212
Hence, old goat!

621
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,381
[crowd shouting]

622
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,094
On both sides more respect!

623
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:06,891
- [crowd booing]
- [yelling]

624
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,601
Shh! Shh!

625
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:13,397
Here's he that would
take from you all your power!

626
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:17,443
You are at point to lose your liberties!

627
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,321
Martius would have all from you,

628
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:24,116
Martius, whom late
you have named for consul.

629
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,952
[angry shouting]

630
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,998
- What is the city but the people?!
- [woman] True!

631
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:35,836
The people are the city!
The people are the city!

632
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:39,465
[clamoring]

633
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,511
We do here pronounce,
upon the part of the people,

634
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,890
Martius is worthy of present death!

635
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,517
[clamoring]

636
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,145
Death!

637
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:58,108
- Guards, seize him!
- No, l'll die here!

638
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,902
[clamoring continuing]

639
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:06,075
Get you to your house! Be gone, away!

640
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:09,870
- All will be naught else!
- Come, sir, along with us!

641
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,580
[clamoring continues]

642
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,820
[sirens wailing nearby]

643
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,217
[clears throat]

644
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,016
[sighs]

645
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:21,317
As l do know the consul's worthiness,
so can l name his faults.

646
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,235
Consul? What consul?

647
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:26,196
- The Consul Coriolanus.
- [scoffs] He, consul?

648
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,991
lt is decreed he dies tonight.

649
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,327
He's a disease that must be cut away.

650
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,413
O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.

651
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,709
Mortal, to cut it off,
to cure it, easy.

652
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,339
What has he done to Rome
that's worth his death, eh?

653
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,427
Killing our enemies?

654
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,764
[sighs]

655
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:56,018
The blood he hath lost,
he dropped it for his country.

656
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,270
- This is clean kam.
- We'll hear no more...

657
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,898
Consider this:

658
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:05,027
He's been bred in the wars
since he could draw a sword,

659
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,696
and is ill-schooled
in graceful language.

660
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:13,243
Give me leave. l'll go to him
and undertake to bring him

661
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:18,248
where he shall answer
by a lawful form, in peace,

662
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,583
to his utmost peril.

663
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,544
Noble tribunes,
it is the humane way.

664
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,714
- Menenius...
- Be you then as the people's officer.

665
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:32,179
ln you bring not Martius,
we'll proceed in our first way.

666
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,850
l'll bring him to you.

667
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,730
Let them pull all about mine ears,

668
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,691
present me death on the wheel
or at wild horses' heels,

669
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,985
- yet will l still be thus to them!
- Martius...

670
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,114
l muse my mother
does not approve me further.

671
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,450
l talk of you.
Why would you wish me milder?

672
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,245
Would you have me false to my nature?

673
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,624
Rather say l play the man l am.

674
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:12,302
Sir, sir, l would have had
you put your power well on

675
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,304
before you had worn it out.

676
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,973
- Let go.
- You might have been enough

677
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,892
the man you are,
with striving less to be so.

678
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,937
- Let them hang.
- Aye, and burn, too.

679
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,314
Come, come, you've been
too rough, something too rough.

680
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,233
You must return and mend it.

681
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:29,403
There's no remedy, unless,
by not so doing, our good city

682
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,738
cleave in the midst and perish.

683
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:35,409
Pray, be counseled.

684
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,954
l have a heart as little apt as yours,

685
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:44,001
but yet a brain that leads
my use of anger to better vantage.

686
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,128
- Well said, noble woman.
- And what must l do?

687
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,464
- Return to the tribunes.
- What then? What then?

688
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:52,176
- Repent what you have spoke.
- For them? l cannot do it to the gods.

689
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,719
Must l then do it to them?

690
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,350
You are too absolute.

691
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:07,316
l've heard you say
that honor and policy,

692
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,818
like unsevered friends in war,
do grow together.

693
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,362
Why force you this?

694
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:16,533
Because that now it lies
you on to speak to the people,

695
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,827
not by your own instruction,

696
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,371
nor by the matter
your heart prompts you,

697
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,626
but with such words that
are but roted in your tongue,

698
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:31,256
though but bastards and syllables
of no allowance to your bosom's truth.

699
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,136
l would dissemble
with my nature where my fortune

700
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:41,683
and my friends at stake required
l should do so in honor.

701
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:47,356
l am, in this, your wife,
your son, the senators,

702
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:52,236
nobles... and you.

703
00:58:54,864 --> 00:59:00,702
l prithee now, my son,
go to them, be with them,

704
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:06,625
say to them thou art their soldier.

705
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,169
And being bred in broils

706
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:14,132
has not the soft way
in asking their good loves.

707
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:19,555
But thou wilt frame thyself,

708
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,099
forsooth, hereafter theirs.

709
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:28,855
This but done, even as she speaks,
why their hearts were yours.

710
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,233
l prithee, go and be ruled.

711
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:36,405
Sir, it is fit you make strong party,

712
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,157
or defend yourself
by calmness or by absence.

713
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,411
- All's in anger.
- Only fair speech.

714
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,581
l think it will serve
if he can thereto frame his spirit.

715
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,709
He must.

716
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:52,129
He will.

717
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,465
Prithee now, say you will,
and go about it.

718
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:59,595
Must l, with base tongue,
give my noble heart

719
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,431
a lie that it must bear?

720
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,226
Well, l'll do it.

721
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:12,899
Away, my disposition,
and possess me some harlot's spirit.

722
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:17,237
A beggar's tongue
make motion through my lips.

723
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,616
l will not do it.

724
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,619
Lest l cease to honor mine own truth,

725
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:27,247
and by my body's action teach
my mind a most inherent baseness.

726
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,167
At thy choice, then.

727
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,961
To beg of thee is more
my dishonor than thou of them.

728
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,630
Come all to ruin.

729
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,676
Let thy mother rather
feel thy pride than fear

730
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:43,013
thy dangerous stoutness,
for l mock at death

731
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:47,517
with as big heart as thou.
Do as you like.

732
01:00:56,194 --> 01:01:00,947
Thy valiantness was mine,
thou suck'st it from me,

733
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,325
but owe thy pride thyself.

734
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,536
Pray, be content, Mother, l'm going.

735
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:13,043
Chide me no more. Look, l am going.

736
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,384
l'll return consul, or never
trust to what my tongue can do

737
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:24,596
- in the way of flattery further.
- Do your will.

738
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:28,684
ln this point, charge him home:
that he affects tyrannical power.

739
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:32,521
lf he evade us there, enforce him
with his hatred to the people.

740
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,189
Have you a catalog of all the voices

741
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,982
that we have procured
set down by the poll?

742
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:37,901
l have. lt's ready.

743
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,194
When the people hear me say

744
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,196
"lt shall be so in the right
and strength of the commons,"

745
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,490
be it either for death, for fine,
or banishment,

746
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:46,326
then, let them, if they hear me say
"Fine," cry "Fine."

747
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,829
- lf "Death," cry "Death."
- We shall inform them.

748
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,834
- [man] God preserve thee.
- [light applause]

749
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,803
[indistinct chatter]

750
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:15,230
- [whistles]
- [jeering]

751
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,482
[loud jeer]

752
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,154
[shrill whistle]

753
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,534
The people are the city.

754
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,870
Put not your worthy rage
into your tongue.

755
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,997
Calmly, l beseech you.

756
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,292
[jeering subsides]

757
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,220
[clears throat]

758
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,896
- The honored gods...
- [microphone whines]

759
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,439
[crowd laughing]

760
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,782
[clears throat]

761
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:09,951
The honored gods
keep Rome in safety,

762
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,747
and the chairs ofjustice
supplied with worthy men,

763
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:17,125
plant love among us,

764
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,961
throng our large temples
with the shows of peace,

765
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,088
and not our streets with war.

766
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,758
- Amen, amen.
- A noble wish.

767
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:28,261
Shall l be charged
no further than this present?

768
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,222
Must all determine here?

769
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:34,267
l do demand, if you submit
you to the people's voices.

770
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:35,977
[scattered voices] Aye.

771
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:40,440
- l am content.
- Lo, citizens, he says he is content.

772
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:45,403
The warlike service
he has done, consider.

773
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,405
Think upon the wounds his body bears,

774
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:50,325
which show like graves
in the holy churchyard.

775
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,370
Scratches with briers,
scars to move laughter only.

776
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:57,666
Consider further, that when
he speaks not like a citizen,

777
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,210
- you find him like a soldier.
- [inaudible murmurs]

778
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:04,464
Do not take his rougher accents
for malicious sounds, but, as l say,

779
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:08,176
such as become a soldier.

780
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:12,806
What is the matter that being
passed for consul with full voice,

781
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:16,726
l am so dishonored that the very hour
you take it off again?

782
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:20,772
We charge you that you have contrived
to take from Rome all seasoned office,

783
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,984
and to wind yourself
into a power tyrannical,

784
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,402
for which you are
a traitor to the people.

785
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,945
How... traitor?

786
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,197
- Traitor!
- Nay, temperately. Your promise.

787
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,867
The fires in the lowest hell
fold in the people.

788
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,786
Call me their traitor,
thou injurious tribune?

789
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,122
- Mark you this, people?
- Yes.

790
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,790
- [angry shouts]
- [man] Traitor!

791
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,878
But since he hath
served well for Rome...

792
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,546
What do you prate of service?

793
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,923
- l talk of that, that know it.
- You?

794
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:48,717
ls this the promise
you made your mother?

795
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,846
l'll know no further. Let them
pronounce death, exile, flaying,

796
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:56,641
l would not buy their mercy
at the price of one fair word.

797
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:59,936
ln the name of the people,
and in the power of us, the tribunes,

798
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:03,231
we, even from this instant,
banish him our city.

799
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:07,569
ln the people's name, l say...
it shall be so.

800
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:13,158
- lt shall be so!
- He's banished. lt shall be so!

801
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,870
- [crowd shouting]
- lt shall be so!

802
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:20,665
- [chanting] lt shall be so!
- [Cominius] Hear me, my masters,

803
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:22,000
and my common friends...

804
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,794
- He's sentenced. No more hearing.
- [Cominius] Let me speak.

805
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:27,505
- [overlapping] lt shall be so!
- l have been consul

806
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:31,301
and can show for Rome
her enemies' marks upon me...

807
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:35,013
There is no more to be said,
but he is banished as enemy

808
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,223
- to the people and his country!
- [crowd] lt shall be so!

809
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,060
- lt shall be so!
- lt shall be so!

810
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:43,146
[chanting] lt shall be so!
lt shall be so!

811
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,732
lt shall be so! lt shall be so!

812
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,318
- lt shall be so!
- lt shall be so!

813
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:53,239
lt shall be so! lt shall be so!

814
01:05:53,407 --> 01:06:02,874
lt shall be so! lt shall be so!
lt shall be so! lt shall be so!

815
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:08,880
You common cry of curs!

816
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:14,886
Whose breath l hate
as reeks of the rotten fens,

817
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:19,474
whose loves l prize
as the dead carcasses

818
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:24,062
of unburied men
that do corrupt my air.

819
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:27,440
l... banish... you!

820
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:32,988
And here remain with your uncertainty.

821
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:37,742
Let every feeble rumor
shake your hearts.

822
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,745
Your enemies,
with nodding of their caps,

823
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,790
fan you into despair.

824
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:49,421
Have the power still to banish
your defenders, till at length

825
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:54,009


826
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,012
making but reservation of yourselves,

827
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:01,433
still your own foes deliver you

828
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:05,186
as most abated captives to some nation

829
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:09,065
that won you without blows.

830
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:18,783
Despising, for you, the city...

831
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,870
...thus...

832
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:25,081
...l turn my back.

833
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:32,338
There is a world... elsewhere.

834
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,935
The people's enemy is gone!

835
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,648
- [applause]
- [cheering]

836
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:04,329
- [laughter]
- Whoo!

837
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,846
[cheering]

838
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,977
[children chattering nearby]

839
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,525
[dogs barking]

840
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:44,244
[indistinct chatter]

841
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:21,823
[Martius] Nay, Mother,
where is your ancient courage?

842
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:26,077
- [Mother] You are too absolute.
- [birds cawing]

843
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:30,039
[Martius] Nay, Mother,
l shall be loved when l am lacked.

844
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:35,545
l go alone, like to a lonely dragon.

845
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:52,455
- The gods preserve you both.
- Good day to you all.

846
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:53,998
The gods keep you.

847
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,875
This is a happier
and more comely time.

848
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:58,586
- Yeah.
- Good day. Good day.

849
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,758
- O, here comes his mother.
- Let's not meet her.

850
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,971
- They say she's mad.
- O, you're well met.

851
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,809
The hoarded plague of the gods
requite thy love.

852
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,354
- Will you be gone?
- You shall stay, too!

853
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,982
l would l had the power
to say so to my husband.

854
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:22,318
- Are you mad?
- Aye, fool, is that a shame?

855
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:27,073
l tell thee what, fool,
hadst thou craft to banish him

856
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,868
that struck more blows for Rome
than thou hast spoken words?

857
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:32,453
[gasping] Blessed heavens...

858
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:36,791
More noble blows
than ever thou wise words,

859
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:41,254
and for Rome's good. Yet go.

860
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:45,091
Nay, thou shalt stay, too.

861
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,051
l tell thee what.

862
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:52,223
l would my son were in Arabia,
and thy tribe before him,

863
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:55,101
- his good sword in his hand.
- What then?

864
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:58,855
What then?
He'd make an end of thy posterity!

865
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:02,233
- Bastards and all.
- Come! Come, peace!

866
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,776
Well, well, we'll leave you.

867
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:08,031
Why stay we to be baited
by one who wants her wits?

868
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:15,371
l would the gods
had nothing else to do

869
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:19,375
but to confirm my curses!

870
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:27,717
Could l meet them but once a day,

871
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:32,263
it would unclog my heart
of what lies heavy to it.

872
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:37,101
You have told them home.
And, by my troth, you have cause.

873
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,105
You'll sup with me?

874
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:43,441
Anger's my meat.

875
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:47,320
l sup upon myself...

876
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,616
...and so shall starve with feeding.

877
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,205
- Come.
- Come, madam.

878
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:40,164
[hoofbeats approaching]

879
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:51,486
[indistinct chatter]

880
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:54,363
[up-tempo music plays nearby]

881
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:16,219
Hey.

882
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,359
[men calling out] Aufidius!

883
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:37,448
Ah, general.

884
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:44,455
Yes.

885
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:51,462
Well, well.

886
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:00,972
[bell tolling]

887
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:26,831
[soldiers chattering, muffled]

888
01:16:40,804 --> 01:16:43,472
- [door opens]
- [man] Hey, hey!

889
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,142
- [grunting]
- [weapons cocking]

890
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,578
Whence comes thou?

891
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,127
Thy name?

892
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:18,549
Speak, man.
What's thy name?

893
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:21,636
A name unmusical
to the Volscians' ears,

894
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,679
and harsh in sound to thine.

895
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:28,017
Say... what's thy name?

896
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,647
Thou has a grim appearance.

897
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:35,524
What's thy name?

898
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:41,822
- Know'st thou me yet?
- l know thee not.

899
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,284
Thy name?

900
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:49,622
My name is Caius Martius...

901
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:54,460
...who hath done to thee, particularly,

902
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:59,590
and to all the Volsces
great hurt and mischief.

903
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:02,468
Thereto witness may my surname...

904
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:05,471
...Coriolanus.

905
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,810
Only that name remains.

906
01:18:10,977 --> 01:18:13,729
The cruelty and envy of the people

907
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:17,441
who have all forsook me
hath devoured the rest,

908
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:22,363
and suffered me by the voice of slaves
to be whooped out of Rome.

909
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,283
Now this extremity
hath brought me to thy hearth,

910
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:29,787
not out of hope,
mistake me not, to save my life,

911
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:33,332
for if l had feared death,
of all men in the world

912
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,584
l would have avoided thee.

913
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:40,297
But, in mere spite, to be full quit
of those, my banishers,

914
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:43,175
stand l before thee here.

915
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:48,222
l will fight against my cankered country

916
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,267
with the spleen of all the under fiends.

917
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:57,106
But if thou dares not this,

918
01:18:57,274 --> 01:19:01,277
then l present my throat to thee
and to thy ancient malice,

919
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:05,614
which not to cut would
show thee but a fool,

920
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:08,701
since l have ever
followed thee with hate,

921
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:12,705
and cannot live but to thy shame

922
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:16,041
unless it be to do thee service.

923
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:28,179
[breathing heavily]

924
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,900
O Martius...

925
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,402
Martius...

926
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,531
Each word thou hast spoke

927
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:51,952
hath weeded from my heart
a root of ancient envy.

928
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:02,880
Let me twine mine arms about that body.

929
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:12,640
Know thou...

930
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:18,854
...l loved the maid l married,
never man sighed truer breath.

931
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:25,694
But that l see thee here,
thou noble thing...

932
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:31,033
...more dances my rapt heart

933
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,285
than when l first

thou hast beat me out 1 2 several times,

of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.

Worthy Martius,
had we no quarrel else to Rome,

938
01:20:56,643 --> 01:21:01,146
but that thou art thence banished,
we would muster all from 1 2 to 70,

01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:03,941
and, pouring war into
the bowels of ungrateful Rome,

Therefore, most absolute sir...

Your Coriolanus is not much missed,

All's well, and might

Caius Martius was

1090
01:40:03,872 --> 01:40:08,501
The god of soldiers,
inform thy thoughts with nobleness,

1091
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,379
that thou may'st prove
to shame, invulnerable.

1092
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,298
Your knee, sir.

1093
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:20,346
Even he, your wife,
this lady and myself,

1094
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:22,473
- are suitors to you.
- l beseech you, peace.

1095
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:25,393
Or, if you'd ask, remember this:

1096
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:27,979
Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers,

1097
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:31,107
or capitulate again
with Rome's mechanics.

1098
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,401
Tell me not wherein l seem unnatural.

1099
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:38,031
Desire not to allay my rages
and revenges with your colder reasons.

1100
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:42,285
No more, no more.

1101
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:45,997
You have said you
will not grant us anything,

1102
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:49,125
for we have nothing else to ask
but that which you deny already.

1103
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:52,837
Yet we will ask,
that if you fail in our request,

1104
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:56,007
the blame may hang upon
your hardness. Therefore hear us.

1105
01:40:56,675 --> 01:40:58,426
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark.

1106
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:01,137
For we'll hear naught
from Rome in private.

1107
01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:11,314
Your request?

1108
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:43,596
Should we be silent
and not speak, our raiment

1109
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:48,142
and state of bodies would betray
what life we have led since thy exile.

1110
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:53,815
Think with thyself.

1111
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:59,946
How more unfortunate than all
living women are we come hither,

1112
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:05,326
since that thy sight, which should
make our eyes flow with joy,

1113
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:08,955
hearts dance with comforts...

1114
01:42:10,874 --> 01:42:15,586
...constrains them weep
and shake with fear and sorrow...

1115
01:42:17,881 --> 01:42:19,674
...making the mother, wife, and child

1116
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:24,011
to see the son,
the husband and the father

1117
01:42:24,179 --> 01:42:26,430
tearing his country's bowels out.

1118
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:30,810
And we must find an evident calamity,

1119
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:33,938
though we had our wish,
which side should win.

1120
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:39,026
For either thou must,
as a foreign recreant,

1121
01:42:39,194 --> 01:42:43,030
be led with manacles
through our streets,

1122
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:47,410
or else, triumphantly,
tread on thy country's ruin,

1123
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:50,454
and bear the palm
for having bravely shed

1124
01:42:50,622 --> 01:42:52,832
thy wife and children's blood.

1125
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:03,759
For myself... son...

1126
01:43:05,637 --> 01:43:09,640
...l purpose not to wait on fortune
till these wars determine.

1127
01:43:09,808 --> 01:43:12,560
lf l cannot persuade thee
rather to show a noble grace

1128
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,687
to both parts than seek the end to one,

1129
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:18,691
thou shalt no sooner march
to assault thy country

1130
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:21,527
than to tread on thy mother's womb...

1131
01:43:23,238 --> 01:43:24,697
...that brought thee to this world.

1132
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:28,075
Aye, and mine,
that brought you forth this boy

1133
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:29,994
to keep your name living to time.

1134
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:35,249
You shall not tread on me.

1135
01:43:36,543 --> 01:43:38,252
l'll run away till l'm bigger...

1136
01:43:39,838 --> 01:43:41,464
...but then l'll fight!

1137
01:43:43,425 --> 01:43:47,470
- l have sat too long.
- Nay, go not from us thus.

1138
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:53,184
lf it were so that our request
did tend to save the Romans,

1139
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:56,312
thereby to destroy
the Volsces whom you serve,

1140
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:01,651
thou might'st condemn us
as poisonous of your honor.

1141
01:44:01,818 --> 01:44:06,072
No. Our suit is that
you reconcile them.

1142
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:10,034
So that the Volces may say
"This mercy we have showed,"

1143
01:44:10,202 --> 01:44:12,245
the Romans, "This we've received,"

1144
01:44:12,412 --> 01:44:17,291
and each on either side
give the all-hail to thee and cry,

1145
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:19,252
"Be blest for making up this peace!"

1146
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:28,386
Speak to me, son.

1147
01:44:31,848 --> 01:44:33,641
Why dost not speak?

1148
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:41,816
Speak you, daughter.

1149
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,193
He cares not for your weeping.

1150
01:44:44,361 --> 01:44:45,444
Speak thou, boy.

1151
01:44:46,321 --> 01:44:50,074
Perhaps thy childishness will
move him more than can our reasons.

1152
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:52,743
There's no man in the world
more bound to his mother,

1153
01:44:52,911 --> 01:44:55,621
yet here he lets me prate
like one in the stocks!

1154
01:44:55,789 --> 01:45:01,627
Thou hast never, in thy life,
shown thy dear mother any courtesy,

1155
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:05,673
when she, poor hen,
has clucked thee to the wars

1156
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:08,718
and safely home loaded with honor.

1157
01:45:08,885 --> 01:45:13,055
Say my request's unjust and
spurn me back, but if it be not so...

1158
01:45:14,933 --> 01:45:20,563
...thou art not honest
and the gods will plague thee,

1159
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:25,234
that thou restrains from me the duty
which to a mother's part belongs.

1160
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:32,366
Down, ladies.
Let us shame him with our knees!

1161
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,621
Down!

1162
01:45:39,499 --> 01:45:41,292
This is the last.

1163
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:44,837
An end.

1164
01:45:52,929 --> 01:45:57,183
So we will home to Rome,
and die among our neighbors.

1165
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:02,938
Nay.

1166
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:08,402
Behold'st, this boy, that cannot
tell what he would have...

1167
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:13,657
...yet kneels and holds
up hands for fellowship.

1168
01:46:13,825 --> 01:46:18,162
Does reason our petition with more
strength than thou hast to deny it.

1169
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:25,836
Come, let us go.

1170
01:46:26,004 --> 01:46:29,298
This fellow had
a Volscian to his mother!

1171
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:34,845
His wife is in Corioles and
his child like him by chance.

1172
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:40,017
Yet give us our dispatch l am
hushed until our city be afire,

1173
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:41,894
and then l'll speak a little.

1174
01:47:00,455 --> 01:47:02,331
O Mother...

1175
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:09,547
Mother...

1176
01:47:12,759 --> 01:47:14,552
What have you done?

1177
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:21,058
Behold...

1178
01:47:25,564 --> 01:47:28,941
...the heavens do ope...

1179
01:47:31,528 --> 01:47:33,612
...the gods look down...

1180
01:47:37,909 --> 01:47:43,038
...and this unnatural scene
they laugh at.

1181
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:51,380
[sobbing] O my mother!

1182
01:47:58,138 --> 01:47:59,722
Mother!

1183
01:48:04,936 --> 01:48:06,270
[sobs] O!

1184
01:48:14,571 --> 01:48:17,740
You have won...

1185
01:48:19,242 --> 01:48:23,287
...a happy victory to Rome.

1186
01:48:26,124 --> 01:48:29,668
But for your son, believe it.

1187
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:32,838
O believe it.

1188
01:48:34,633 --> 01:48:39,553
Most... dangerously
you have prevailed with him.

1189
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:44,475
lf not most mortal to him.

1190
01:48:49,898 --> 01:48:50,981
But let it come.

1191
01:48:55,529 --> 01:48:57,613
Aufidius...

1192
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:05,204
...though l cannot make true wars,
l'll frame convenient peace.

1193
01:49:06,748 --> 01:49:08,624
Now, good Aufidius,
were you in my stead,

1194
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:13,170
would you have heard a mother less?
Or granted less? Aufidius?

1195
01:49:14,631 --> 01:49:16,382
l was moved withal.

1196
01:49:17,133 --> 01:49:21,262
l dare be sworn you were.
And, sir, it is no little thing

1197
01:49:21,429 --> 01:49:23,847
to make mine eyes to sweat compassion.

1198
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:30,396
But, good sir, what peace
you'll make, advise me.

1199
01:50:21,239 --> 01:50:24,033
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome.

1200
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:27,202
No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

1201
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:33,042
We have all great cause
to give great thanks.

1202
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:38,756
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.

1203
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,687
How is it with our general?

1204
01:50:53,855 --> 01:50:56,523
As with a man by his own charity slain.

1205
01:50:56,691 --> 01:51:01,195
Our soldiers will remain uncertain
whilst 'twixt you there's difference,

1206
01:51:01,363 --> 01:51:03,906
but the fall of either
makes the survivor heir of all.

1207
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:05,449
l know it.

1208
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:10,245
And my pretext to strike
at him admits a good construction.

1209
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:17,294
l raised him, and l pawned
mine honor for his truth,

1210
01:51:17,462 --> 01:51:20,631
who, being so heightened,

1211
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:24,343
he watered his new plants
with dews of flattery,

1212
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:26,178
seducing so my friends.

1213
01:51:28,932 --> 01:51:32,685
At the last, l seemed his follower,
not partner,

1214
01:51:32,852 --> 01:51:36,146
and he waged me with his countenance
as if l had been mercenary.

1215
01:51:36,314 --> 01:51:39,149
So he did, my lord.
The army marveled at it.

1216
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:42,027
And, in the last,
when he had carried Rome

1217
01:51:42,195 --> 01:51:44,405
and that we looked
for no less spoil than glory...

1218
01:51:44,572 --> 01:51:46,615
There was it!

1219
01:51:46,783 --> 01:51:49,368
For which my sinews shall be
stretched upon him.

1220
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:57,918
At a few drops of women's rheum,
which are as cheap as lies,

1221
01:51:58,086 --> 01:52:02,923
he sold the blood and labor
of our great action.

1222
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:08,137
Therefore shall he die...

1223
01:52:10,432 --> 01:52:14,268
- ...and l'll renew me in his fall.
- [man whistles]

1224
01:52:15,061 --> 01:52:17,062
- [vehicle approaching]
- Say no more.

1225
01:53:22,629 --> 01:53:25,964
l am returned your soldier,

1226
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:29,760
no more infected with my country's love
than when l parted hence,

1227
01:53:29,928 --> 01:53:34,014
but still subsisting
under your great command.

1228
01:53:34,182 --> 01:53:37,267
We have made peace with
no less honor to the Volscians

1229
01:53:37,435 --> 01:53:39,269
than shame to the Romans.

1230
01:53:39,437 --> 01:53:41,855
Tell the traitor,
in the highest degree

1231
01:53:42,023 --> 01:53:45,734
- he hath abused your powers.
- Traitor? How now?

1232
01:53:45,902 --> 01:53:48,153
Aye, traitor, Martius.

1233
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:51,698
- "Martius"?
- Aye, Martius.

1234
01:53:52,742 --> 01:53:54,535
Caius Martius.

1235
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:58,163
Dost thou think l'll grace
thee with that robbery,

1236
01:53:58,331 --> 01:54:00,415
thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?

1237
01:54:01,876 --> 01:54:06,338
Perfidiously he hath
betrayed your business

1238
01:54:06,506 --> 01:54:11,802
and given up,
for certain drops of salt,

1239
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,679
your city, Rome.

1240
01:54:13,847 --> 01:54:19,518
l say "your city,"
for his wife and mother.

1241
01:54:20,395 --> 01:54:26,233
Breaking his oath and resolution
like a twist of rotten silk.

1242
01:54:26,985 --> 01:54:30,821
Never admitting counsel of the war,
but at his nurse's tears,

1243
01:54:30,989 --> 01:54:34,283
he whined and roared away your victory.

1244
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:36,034
Hear'st thou, Mars?

1245
01:54:36,202 --> 01:54:39,329
Name not the god, thou boy of tears.

1246
01:54:39,497 --> 01:54:44,710
Measureless liar, thou has made my heart
too great for what contains it.

1247
01:54:44,878 --> 01:54:48,463
"Boy"? O slave.

1248
01:54:48,631 --> 01:54:51,258
Cut me to pieces, Volsces!

1249
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:56,346
Men and lads,
stain all your edges on me!

1250
01:54:56,514 --> 01:54:57,514
"Boy"?

1251
01:54:59,976 --> 01:55:02,519
lf you have writ your annals true,

1252
01:55:02,687 --> 01:55:05,981
'tis there that,
like an eagle in a dovecote,

1253
01:55:06,149 --> 01:55:09,735
l fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.

1254
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:12,654
Alone l did it.

1255
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:14,990
"Boy."

1256
01:55:22,415 --> 01:55:23,957
Let him die for it.
