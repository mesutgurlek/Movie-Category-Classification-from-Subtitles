1
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,277
(Muffled Explosions)

2
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,030
It has been reported that the
Nazi ﬂeet of U-boats exceeds 500.

3
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,557
Hitter knows how near disaster Britain was
in the last war in 1917

4
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,950
when the U-boat menace all but
strangled our supply lanes on the sea.

5
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,598
We are an island people.

6
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,672
We cannot survive
without our communications across the sea.

7
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,716
Hitler knows this only too well.

8
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,156
These pictures
from another captured German newsreel

9
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,028
bring home with vivid reality the daily
and nightly threat to all our shipping.

10
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,235
That, gentlemen, is what we've got to stop.

11
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,439
It may seem incredible but there is at the
moment one reason why we cannot stop it.

12
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Tirpitz.

13
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,519
Tirpitz is lying 60 miles inland
up a Norwegian fjord

14
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,593
And because of the threat
she constitutes, we

15
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,698
have to keep half a fleet
watching out for her.

16
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,352
Wasted ships, gentlemen.

17
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,512
Ships that we urgently need
to protect our Atlantic convoys.

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,319
The Royal Air Force have made
two attacks without success.

19
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,158
The cliffs of the fjord
are so steep that she

20
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:56,184
might as well be lying
in an air-raid shelter.

21
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,993
Somehow, gentlemen,
Tirpitz has got to be put out of action.

22
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,115
How?

23
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,354
[Emma]; Human torpedos, sir.

24
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,513
Two men riding across the North Sea
sitting on half a tonne of high explosive?

25
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,192
It's not practical.

26
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,354
Yes, Fraser?

27
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,037
It is practical, sir.

28
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,192
Nobody here seems to realise
how simple such an operation could be.

29
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,599
Hardly

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,913
I've got the men, sir.

31
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,356
Give us the machines and we'll put
Tirpitz out of action for you.

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,273
You seem very sure of
that, Commander Fraser.

33
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,874
Yes, sir. I'm sure of it.

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,075
- Mr Corbett.
- Yes, sir.

35
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,799
Volunteered from shore base, didn't you.
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,952
- Too much paper and not enough work, eh?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,996
Well, I dare say we can alter that.

38
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,156
- Mr Duffy.

39
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,830
- What's that?
- It's a pullover, sir.

40
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,358
- As worn in the Australian
Navy, I suppose. - No, sir.

41
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,396
Not in this Navy either, Mr Duffy.

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,676
[HEEL) Now listen.

43
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,672
just because you volunteered
for special service,

44
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,675
it doesn't mean you can dress up in fancy
clothes like a bunch of fighter pilots.

45
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,988
Remember that.

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,433
How old did you say you
were, Mr Abercrombie?

47
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,670
‘19, sir.

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,513
- Looking for a bit of excitement?
- Yes, sir.

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,479
Well, you won't have to look far in
this outfit. It'll come slap at you.

50
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,515
We were together in the Med, Ramsey,
weren't we?

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,749
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,115
- How's the wife?
- OK now, sir.

53
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,555
- Boy or girl?
- Boy, sir.

54
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,596
Good for you.

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,955
Smart.

56
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,634
Are you going to like this
any better than being a steward?

57
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,676
Dunno, sir, yet.

58
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,593
- You'll give us a try, eh?
- Try anything once, sir.

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,874
We've served together before, Hutchins,
haven't we?

60
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,269
- Yes, sir.

61
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,920
- Married yet?
- No, sir.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,558
Not found the perfect woman, eh?

63
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,995
- They're all perfect to me, sir.
- Yeah.

64
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,433
Well, keep your mind on the job.

65
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,317
- This job, Hutchins.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,396
(Distant hooter)

67
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,313
No offence to present company

68
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,446
but only an English RN
officer would think of

69
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,384
putting up that, and
filling it with water!

70
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,640
All right, the order of
ascent will be Mr Duffy,

71
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,472
Mister Corbet,

72
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,754
Mr. Abercrombie

73
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,319
- You all right, Ramsey?
- Chief.

74
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,435
- Smart.
- Chief.

75
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,158
- Leading Seaman Hutchins.
- Chief.

76
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,196
Right, class ready.

77
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,997
Now, don't forget, breathe out.

78
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,800
- Good. I'll go and see how they are.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,156
Whoa.

80
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,353
Old Tom marched in
as if he was going to the gallows.

81
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,908
What about you, Digger?
You went green all over.

82
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,639
I feel as if I hadn't spent a penny
since Christmas.

83
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,915
- Cheer up, Ernie. It's all over now.
- Whoo.

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,877
200 stairs.

85
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,916
Next time I'm coming up your way.

86
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,359
Any casualties?

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,112
ALL: No, sir.

88
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,156
We must think up something
else, mustn't we?

89
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,992
Thank you very much, sir.

90
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,071
All right, gentlemen? Now the other arm.

91
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,752
Come on, Stan, push!

92
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,593
- Push.
- I am pushing.

93
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,558
- Nice and comfy, sir?
- Ha, blimey.

94
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,872
- It'll be better when you get in the
water, sir. - Well, it couldn't be worse.

95
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,996
Come on. This could be an emergency.

96
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,798
It is an emergency ,sir.

97
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,836
Right, heads up!

98
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,196
Right?

99
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,316
Push!

100
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,038
- How is it, Stan?
- (Muffled) Lovely.

101
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,838
- Eh?
" Lovely!"

102
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,717
- Oh.
- Fits you like a glove, boy.

103
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,074
All right, get ‘em aboard.

104
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,715
See any mermaids, Tom?

105
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,518
Yes. Two. But they wouldn't
look at anything under a Commander.

106
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,396
Ah.

107
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,634
- Get a move on, Mr Duffy, sir.
You're next. - (Abercrombie laughs)

108
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,391
Morale...

109
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,396
..is at its highest level.

110
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,036
What is needed now...

111
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,876
is more machines...

112
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,438
and real agressive action.

113
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,316
Stand to attention!

114
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,908
- Stand them at ease, please.
- Stand at ease.

115
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,568
Now, I want to read you
part of a letter that

116
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:01,583
I received from the
Admiralty this morning.

117
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,835
With reguards to your request
for aggressive action

118
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,354
to be carried out by the
Mark I Human Torpedo,

119
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,395
it has never been naval policy
to risk life unnecessarily,

120
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,278
with untried and experimental weapons.

121
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,478
The Mark I Human Torpedo
is an unproven machine.

122
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,717
You are reminded, moreover,
that her crew are unproven also.".

123
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,556
And don't look so damn
sorry for yourselves.

124
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,589
You see that?

125
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,913
The Admiralty
oughtn't to write us this sort of a letter,

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,709
especially when the Home Fleet's
exercising on our doorstep.

127
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,119
(Whistle)

128
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,872
(Hooter)

129
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,994
- You all set?
- Yes, sir.

130
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,957
Now listen...

131
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,999
they've got two anti-submarine nets out
and one anti-torpedo.

132
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,672
And watch out for the patrol boat.

133
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,957
- Sounds as if they knew we were coming.
- That's just normal procedure.

134
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,397
Now, I want all charges laid by 2230 hours.

135
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,074
And I want you all in and out by that time.

136
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,513
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

137
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,434
Now, don't forget, you've got to dive
at least a mile from the target.

138
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,919
And it's not going to be easy.

139
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,115
Well?

140
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,758
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

141
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,957
- Er, I suppose they are dummy charges.
- Oh, yes, sir.

142
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,271
Good. Because I'm going to be
sitting right on top of them.

143
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,796
Hey, feeling all right, cobber?

144
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:32,855
Fine.

145
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,348
Steward's delight, this
is, blowing up Admirals.

146
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,236
- All set?
- Lovely.

147
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,912
Come on.

148
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,037
We'll be there and back
before those boys get through the nets.

149
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,516
The admirals' waiting for you, sir.

150
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,792
I suppose you've come to pester
me about your toy submarine.

151
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,189
Oh, hardly pester, sir.

152
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,272
I don't mind admitting quite frankly
that I'm again ‘em.

153
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,679
Oh, sorry to hear that, sir.

154
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,716
I think you may be proved wrong.

155
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,993
Now you're talking, my boy.

156
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,514
Conjecture and enthusiasm are one thing.

157
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,670
Proofs an entirely
different kettle of fish.

158
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,875
Yes, sir.

159
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,189
Thank you, sir.

160
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,033
(Sighs) Roll on 12 o'clock.
Lets get turned in.

161
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,955
The Italians have tried them
in the Mediterranean

162
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,600
but they've been
playing about with toy subs for years.

163
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,795
Whereas...

164
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,235
- What's the matter, Fraser?
- Nothing, sir.

165
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,880
- Not boring you, am l?
- Oh, Lord, no, sir.

166
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,155
Then stop fiddling with
that infernal watch.

167
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,196
Oh, sorry, sir.

168
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,708
What exactly did you want to see me about?

169
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,119
Er...

170
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,758
W-W-Well...

171
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,193
N-Nothing in particular, sir.

172
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,319
L-l just wanted your general views
on the tactical uses of the chariots.

173
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,956
(Sighs)  I'll be quite blunt.

174
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,673
I don't think they have any tactical use

175
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,751
while they remain an unknown quantity.

176
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,115
- Unproven.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,679
You uh...

178
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,274
- You think I ought to give you proof, sir?
- Undoubtedly.

179
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,395
(Explosion)

180
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,629
(Second explosion)

181
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,910
- What the devil's that?
- The proof, sir.

182
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,353
- Proof?
- Yes, sir.

183
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,670
Those were dummy charges
on the hull of this ship.

184
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,278
If they hadn't been dummies, you'd be
on the bottom now, sir, for the duration.

185
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,715
Damn fine show, Winley. 100%.

186
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,994
I think we've sold it.

187
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,957
It's Mr Abercrombie and Ramsey, sir.

188
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,634
- Aren't they back?
- Yes, sir.

189
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,071
- They all right?
- They will be, sir.

190
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,994
Wouldn't have been so funny if we'd had to
kill a man to get our own way, would it?

191
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,514
Have we got our own way, sir?

192
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,556
Yeah.

193
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:44,935
.Fraser.

194
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,916
Goodbye-

195
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Sir.

196
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,669
- Smart.
- Yes, sir.

197
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,910
Could I speak to you for a moment, sir?

198
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,956
Well, of course. What's on your mind?

199
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,951
I'm sorry to trouble you so late, sir.

200
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,395
Oh, it's not late.

201
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,755
I've thought about this a lot, sir.

202
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,479
And I thought that if I
could speak to someone...

203
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,316
I'm scared, sir.

204
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,516
- Of diving?
- Yes, sir.

205
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,114
I'm all right, sir, I'm quite all right,
until I feel the water pressing down on me.

206
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,192
And then I sort of panic inside, like.

207
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,589
- I haven't noticed it.
- No, sir.

208
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,796
That's the point, surely.
I haven't noticed it.

209
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,394
- It's still there, sir. And I felt...
- Cigarette?

210
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,074
Oh, thank you very much, sir.

211
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,197
Now, there are two kinds of courage,
aren't there?

212
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,193
One fellow's brave
because he doesn't know what fear is.

213
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,396
The other fellow's brave...

214
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,472
because he's afraid and fights
it and doesn't show it.

215
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,755
Supposing I couldn't fight it, sir?

216
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,593
Supposing we got in a
jam and I lost my head.

217
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,910
There's two of us on them
things, isn't there?

218
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,752
Hm

219
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,995
You're not the only one who's come to me
with this story, you know.

220
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,479
- I'm not, sir?
- Far from it.

221
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,391
You don't think I ought to back out, then?

222
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,109
- Do you want to back out? That's
the real question. - No, sir, I don't.

223
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,474
It... Well...

224
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,552
It sort of facinates me in
spite of being scared stiff.

225
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,677
I tested Cassidy, you know,
with Chief Petty Officer Chubb.

226
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,877
- Yes, sir. I know.
- Frankly, I was scared stiff, too.

227
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,436
Thank you, sir.

228
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,312
Whump. She's a goner.

229
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,668
How's that?

230
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,035
If you put a charge there my boy,
you'll be a genius.

231
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,998
- Right on the captain's backside.
- Attention.

232
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,638
Right, carry on, Chief.

233
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,075
Here he is. Lieutenant Anderson.

234
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,878
Royal Norweigan Naval Reserve

235
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,269
I'm very happy to be here.

236
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,879
He spent the last two years in Norway

237
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,428
and he's got some very interesting things
to tell us.

238
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,236
- Abercrombie.
- Sir.

239
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,559
Well, cheer up.

240
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,552
- Some of us have to stay behind, you know.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,312
Incidentally,

242
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,470
even if you hadn't done that,

243
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,516
I still wouldn't have
sent you on this trip.

244
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,955
You took some pretty big
risks the other night.

245
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,270
Pamsey didn't say anything,
but I can guess.

246
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,635
I tried to get under the net, sir.

247
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,517
- In the deepest part?
- Yes, sir.

248
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,556
- Why?
- Well, we...

249
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,598
I wanted to get in there first, sir.

250
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,671
Damn nearly killed yourself doing it.

251
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,513
- Ramsey, too.
- I know, sir. I'm very sorry.

252
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,953
I'm not organizing a race.

253
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,110
These things are planned operations.

254
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,952
I want a team.

255
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,076
Not a lot of characters
out collecting gongs.

256
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,517
Now, you can kill yourself any time you
like but don't go killing other people.

257
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,556
Pamsey's got a wife and kids.

258
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,716
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

259
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,751
FRASER: Tirpitz

260
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,432
Now, you can see

261
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,476
that she lies a long way inland.

262
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,756
60 miles to be exact.

263
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,189
And every yard of it is going to be tricky.

264
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,191
Damn tricky.

265
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,755
There'll be German patrol boats,
shore batteries and all the rest of it.

266
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:17,636
But your main danger may well be that, in a
flat calm, anyone who looks closely enough

267
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,076
will be able to see the chariot
secured below the water line.

268
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,360
And don't forget,

269
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,431
you'll be sailing in a very small boat.

270
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,750
She's unarmed.

271
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,549
And you're going to go through one of the
best defended stretches of water we know.

272
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,079
The Ingebord will have forged papers
showing that she's a Norwegian ﬁshing boat

273
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,789
on passage from Edoy to Trondheim
with a cargo of peat.

274
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,436
(Thudding)

275
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,228
- She's loose.
- Sounds like it.

276
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,356
SMART: Oi!

277
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,708
I think number two's adrift forward.

278
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,313
She's pulling to port.

279
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,197
Can you go down and fix it?

280
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,633
I can try.

281
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,790
I'd better find you some calmer water.

282
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,916
Big wrench. Quick!

283
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,915

288
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,958
Leave that to me. Get below.

Sven.

291
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,550
If Mr Corbett tries to
come aboard, stop him.

292
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,154
- It does not matter how, just stop him.
- Ja.

Well, another 15 minutes.

308

309

Can't tell.

00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,270
Only 15 minutes.

ANDERSON:
Trondheim‘s on the starboard beam now.

312
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,279
That means Tirpitz.

313
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,316
Less than 10 miles away.

Can you attack in this weather?

316
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,028
- We can attack in any weather.
- It'll be dead calm on the bottom.

Better finish getting dressed.
The less we hang about, the better.

318
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,829
(Thudding)

319
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,876
Hey!

320
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,916
(Scraping)

321
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,556
(Thudding

322
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,957
Port chariots a goner.
Not even a shackle left.

323
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,112
That means both of them gone.
Starboard snapped clean as a whistle.

324
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,031
Tirpitz is over there.

325
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,951
If it was light, we could see it.

326
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,918
I'd like to get my hands on the blokes
who made those bolts.

327
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,956
Could have reached her easy.

328
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,870
We have no papers for the return voyage.

329
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,916
Then we'll have to scuttle her.

330
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,113
Well, boys, let's go for a walk.

331
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,953
Who's for Sweden? (Whistles)

332
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,716
See anything?

333
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,153
No.

334
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,629
But at this time
they're probably in the guardhouse.

335
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,790
There must be a guard,
so near the frontier.

336
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,836
Ja.

337
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,550
‘Ere, have we got to walk up that?

338
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,751
Ja. Right to the top.

339
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,831
Oh, my poor feet.

340
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,354
- Can't we get moving?
- No, it's not time.

341
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,477
Funny.

342
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,677
I can almost smell ‘em cooking
all those hot dinners down there.

343
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,089
Cor, what I couldn't do
to a ruddy great steak

344
00:29:30,115 --> 00:29:32,097
with onions and chips
and an egg on top.

345
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,070
Whoo.

346
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,072
I'll stand it to you when we get back.
First time ashore.

347
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,752
- Two eggs, Stan?
- It's a deal.

348
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,909
Right, you're on.

349
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,673
I'd say we'll be due for leave
when we get back after this.

350
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,194
Oh, you've got it bad, haven't you?

351
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,430
Well, being married's different somehow.

352
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,794
You're telling me.

353
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,155
I had three years of it.

354
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,037
- Married?
- Yep.

355
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,348
Three years‘ hire.

356
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,079
She gave me me push.

357
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,116
That was bad luck, Duffy.

358
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,589
Well, maybe I chose the wrong girl.

359
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,636
What happened?

360
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,073
I bored her.

361
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,038
Anyway, she found the other boys
more interesting.

362
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,993
- Sorry, Duff.
- I'm not.

363
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,674
Oh, hell, cobber,
you get leave and enjoy yourself.

364
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,193
Pay no attention to Uncle Duffy.

365
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,556
- Who said leave? - Don't tell
me you want to get married, too?

366
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,198
He's got about six wives already.

367
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,599
I wish I had.

368
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,194
You need to lay off
the oatmeal stout and whelks, mate.

369
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,236
Right, It's time we go now.

370
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,870
Where's the actual frontier?

371
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,552
There.

372
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,153
The top of the mountain.

373
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,754
Will the Swedes intern us?

374
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,833
Let us reach Sweden first,
and then worry about that.

375
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,556
Cor, I couldn't half fancy that.

376
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,039
The cook or the cooking?

377
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,879

378
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,238
- (Whispers) Shoo. Shoo. Good boy.
- (Dog barks)

379
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,594
My last. Here.

380
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,836
We go now.

Jawohl.

At the next post, I'll drop. You get him.

388

At the next post, you take the front one.

Quick. There will be others.

392
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,315
Come on, quick!

393
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,316
Right.

394
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,876
- Keep still.
- (Coughs)

395
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,996
Hang on, mate. I want a steak
and chips out of you, remember.

396
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,036
- With two eggs?
- Yeah.

397
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,113
Could you manage a double whack?

398
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,037
What happens?

399
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,192
- I don't know. - Probably stick
us in the nick for the duration.

Him

What did he say?

406
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,757
He says arrangements will be made as soon
as possible to fly us back to Scotland.

407
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,478
- Fly us back to...
- But I...

408
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,312
I thought neutrals were supposed to...

409
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,756
These days no people are neutral.

410
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,070
Well, now that you lot are back from
your winter sports holiday in Sweden,

411
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,310
maybe we can settle down
and get some work done.

412
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
(Laughter)

413
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,477
Because this time we've got a
real striking power in our hands.

414
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,395
A midget submarine.

415
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,597
You'll attack sitting in it, not on it.

416
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,114
And when l say attack, l mean attack.

417
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,833
The midgets carry four
tonnes of high explosive.

418
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,314
We‘re going to blow such a hole in
Tirpitz, she‘ll never move again.

419
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,517
Quite comfortable down there?

420
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,034
It will be, Chief,
when Smart finds room for his feet.

421
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,599
Sorry about that, sir.

422
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,636
My head's not in your way, is it, sir?

423
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,149
- Diver in position.
- Yeah, about time too.

424
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,629
You're the only one who
can stand up straight.

425
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,233
I could if I was six inches shorter.

426
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,073
- Who's your No.1?
- Abercrombie. He's down here.

427
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,071
- He all right?
- Well, he is at the moment.

428
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,197
But he's a growing lad. I doubt if
we'll get him out in an hour's time.

429
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,158

What's the matter with X3?

434
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,876
- I'll ram ‘em and sink ‘em if they
don't hurry up. - All clear, sir.

435
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,269
- Everybody OK? No.1?
- Aye aye, sir.

436

- Engine?
- All set, sir.

437
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,314
- Diver?
- Spare a penny for the diver, sir.

438
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,392
Now, that's an idea. How do you
spend a penny in this contraption?

439
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,076
Lower purchase.

440
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,199
Carefully.

441
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,236
Handsomely.

442
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,834
- We don't want to blow the dockyard up.
- No, sir.

443
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,876
Stop purchase.

444
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,074

- Yeah.

00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,594
Hey!

448
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,949
- I thought they gave
you three weeks.

449
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:14,422
- They did. I knew it was
too good to be true.

450
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,316
Nobody gets three weeks
leave out of this navy.

451
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,516
Unless they're too sick to stand up.

452
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,875
- What's new?
- That is.

453
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,996
Why, it's a side cargo.
I've seen it before.

454
00:37:25,022 --> 00:37:27,103
Yes, except that the
others were dummies.

455
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,388
- This isn't.
- (Clang)

456
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,472
Don't hit it, son. Two tons of
amatol makes an awful big bang.

457
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,314
No amount of hitting will affect it,
but we've heard nasty stories about leaks.

458
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,073
- Leaks in a side cargo?
- Sets it off.

459
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,116
Hey, there's another bit of news, too.

460
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,634
When we do go in,
the old man will lead the attack.

461
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,948
Yes, but when?

462
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,600
- Why muck up our leave?
- Better ask him yourself.

463
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,159
You're early, aren't you?
You weren't due back till 2359.

00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,390

- Good, start right away.

00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,916

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,950
There are worse things than being bored.

477
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,508
Especially if you've got
a wife and children.

478
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,994
What about you?

479
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,513
Me? (Stops playing)

480
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,068
I'm going to buy me a little
boat and just sail it.

481
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,876
- Where?
- Anywhere.

482
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,839
Any place where the booze is cheap
and all the girls have got husbands.

483
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,276
Playing

484
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,671
(Resumes playing more jauntily)

485
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,515
(Whistles tune)

486
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,835
- You know, it's dead funny...
- ‘Ere, what is it?

487
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,354
Um, Deuces Wild, Aces to open.

488
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,830
It's dead funny, you know.
People at home still think I'm a steward.

489
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,912
Ah, poor old Ernie - a hero in disguise.

490
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,433
Well, it's a bit rough, isn't it?

491
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,511
Cor blimey. I'll open and play these.

492
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,556
- What?
- I can't even tell my girl.

493
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,153
I wouldn't worry, Ernie.

494
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,071
- I'll take three.
- Right.

495
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,835
She'll probably pass you up, anyway,
for some lovely big RAF type. With wings.

496
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,878
I'll give him flippin‘ wings if she does,
and a ruddy harp and all.

497
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,393
Come on, what are you going to do?

498
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,277
- I'll bet doubles.
- Don't be reckless.

499
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:32,997
Company

500
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,513
‘Shun.

501
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,556
Sit down, gentlemen.

502
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,076
I know where you're going, mate.

503
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,391
- Norway.
- Really?

504
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,109
ADMIRAL: The passage across the North Sea
will be made under tow.

505
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,476
His Majesty's submarines
Tiger, Tomahawk and Striker

506
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,278
are detailed for this operation.

507
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,830
The attack will be carried out
by three X-type submarines.

508
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,550
Commander Fraser Royal Navy, In X1,
will take charge of the entire operation.

509
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,110
For the purpose of the attack, X1 will
therefore become flotilla leader.

510
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,873
X2 will be commanded by Lieutenant Duffy,

511
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,951
Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve.

512
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,759
X3 will be commanded by lieutenant Corbett,

513
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,319
Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.

514
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,710
During the North Sea passage, each X-type
submarine will be manned by a passage crew.

515
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,509
The operational! Crews wll rest as much
as possible in (he towing submarines.

516
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,593
- Ship's head?
- O95, sir.

517
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,309
- Steer O98.
- Steer O98.

518
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,038
Together

519
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,156
- Group down.
- Group down.

520
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,310
- Blowing up a bit, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,356
We're in the right submarine, then.

522
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,557
I wouldn't be a passage crew
for all the gin in Pompey.

523
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,077
- Depth?
- 7O feet.

524
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,391
- About time for our breath of air,
isn't it? - About half an hour yet.

525
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,038
Cor, what a job.

526
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,917
All the work and none of the glory.

527
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,309
Well, someone's got to do it.

528
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,356
"What did you do in the war, Dad?"

529
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,670
"I was towed across the North Sea."

530
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,638
"Sitting on my um... fat bottom, son."

531
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,994
Oh, ta, sir.

532
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,316
"ANNOUNCEMENT". Check A inboard vent.

533
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,868
Check A inboard vent.

534
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,236
(sighs)

535
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,038
I don't like leaving her behind.

536
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,314
Then take her, Digger.

537
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,277
The order said no personal effects.

538
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,794
Since when have you been
fussy about orders?

539
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,076
All right.

540
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,517
We'll be transferring you to your own craft
about 1800.

541
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,994
All right?

542
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,152
ANNOUNCEMENT:
Diving stations in five minutes time.

543
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,279
Diving stations in five minutes time.

544
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,471
Second coxswain and dinghy party,
muster in the control room.

545
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,640
Second coxswain and dinghy party,
muster in the control room.

546
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,793
- Sir...
- Yes, sir?

547
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,633
What do you reckon they'll give us
for supper - chicken again?

548
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,518
Don't you ever think of
anything except food?

549
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,238
Well, I look at it this way, sir.

550
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,038
Either we get what's coming to us

551
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,190
and then we won't be
bothered by food no more

552
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,236
or else we do the job,
blow Tirpitz sky high,

553
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,675
get nicked by Jerry
and put in a prisoner of war camp.

554
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,061
What's all this about prison camps?
12 hours

555
00:42:29,087 --> 00:42:31,336
after the attack you'll
be back in this sub.

556
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,550
Stuffing yourself with

557
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,870
I'll believe that when I do it, sir.

558
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,030
- You chaps ready?
CORBETT: Yes, sir.

559
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,076
Down periscope.

560
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,074
If we transfer crews now
while there's a bit of light,

561
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,357
- I can tow you in another four miles.
- Fair enough.

562
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,790
Tell X3 we're surfacing to transfer crews.

563
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,474
Tell X3 we are surfacing
to transfer crews, sir.

564
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,154
I have a feeling those chaps
are going to be glad to see us.

565
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,674
- Stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface.

566
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,875
Diving stations.

567
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,713
- Stand by to surface. Report main vents.
- Report main vents.

568
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,473
Open one, two, three, four,
five and six LP master blowers.

569
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,437
Open one, two, three, four, ﬁve and six.

570
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,353
- Check all LP tank size.
- Check all LP tank size.

571
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,549
What's that funny smell, Dad?

572
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,835
- That's air, son.
- All right.

573
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,070
- All right, stand by to transfer.
- Aye aye, sir.

574
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,388
And about time too.

575
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,675
Give the ruddy Tirpitz an
extra kick from us, eh?

576
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,113
Don't worry. We will.

577
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,475
- Good luck.
- Bye.

578
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,834
Rather you than me.

579
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,398
They've transferred crews all right.

580
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,835
Stand by! There's a ruddy
drift mine caught in the tow.

581
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,109
Hey.

582
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,272
Hold on to your hats.
There's a mine caught in our tow.

583
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,039
My God.

584
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:14,680
It's a mine! It's fouled the tow rope.

585
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,068
There's a mine on the tow.
Shut all water-tight doors.

586
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,633
I never could stand loud bangs.

587
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,956
ABERCROMBIE: Right, move along, there.

588
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,392
It's all right. You can take out
your ear plugs. She's gone.

589
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,036
- Corbett and Duffy have
transferred crews, sir. - Good.

590
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,475
- Well, we'd better love you and leave you.
- Yes, sir.

591
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,278
- Ship's head?
- 1'05, sir.

592
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,635
- Periscope depth?
- 32 feet, sir.

593
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,676
Up periscope.

594
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,916
Well?

595
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,589
All clear.

596
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,238
Stand by to surface.

597
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,959
- Diving stations.
- Diving stations.

598
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,190
- Check main vents.
- Check main vents.

599
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,032
Signal X1 we're surfacing.

600
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,473
Signal X1 we're surfacing.

601
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,634
Well, thanks for the ride.

602
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,188
- Blow Tirpitz clean out of the water.
- We'll have a go.

603
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,475
We'll be waiting for the bang about dawn.

604
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,516
- Good luck, sir.
- Bye.

605
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,396
Alright, here we go.

606
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,316
- Dive, dive, dive.
- Dive, dive, dive, sir.

607
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,709
- 3O feet.
- 3O feet, sir.

608
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,631
- Full ahead, group down.
- Full ahead.

609
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,279
- Steer 135.
- ‘I35 it is, sir.

610
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,228
- Give me a course for Stjernsund.
- Aye aye, sir.

611
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,958
Trimmed for diving, sir.

612
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,359
Fine.

613
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,749
- Periscope depth?
- Ten feet.

614
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,512
Half ahead, group down.

615
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,556
Half ahead, group down, sir.

616
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,598
FRASER: Time?

617
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,910
- 2227.
- Not bad.

618
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,318
New course will be 128, sir.

619
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,358
FRASER. Steer 128.
- 128 it is, sir.

620
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,874
- Steady as she goes.
- Steady as she goes.

621
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,469
- Half ahead, group down.
- Half ahead, group down.

622
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,710
Depth.
Depth.

623
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,953
Periscope depth now, sir.

624
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,228
CORBETT.
Looks like shore ﬂights. Fine on port bow.

625
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,276
Any ideas, pilot?

626
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,120
(sighs)

627
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,112
Could be this island.
There's a fishing village there.

628
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,919
What do you mean, could be?
Could be Southend Pier.

629
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,956
Definitely not Southend, sir.

630
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,235
Well, boys, we're on our way.

631
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,677
Let's pop in quick, blow her sky high,
and home in time for bed, eh?

632
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,591
Talking.

633
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,596
- Course?
- Course 172, sir.

634
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,794
There's something on the starboard beam.

635
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,233
It's a tanker.

636
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,276
Take her down 40 feet. Flood Q.

637
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,316
Flooding.

638
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,076
Q flooded.

639
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,796
(Ship's engines)

640
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,116
40 feet, sir.

641
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,156
(Engines come closer)

642
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,116
(Engines fade)

643
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,669
The skipper of the big sub
will be biting his nails when he sees that.

644
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,716
Not allowed to torpedo!

645
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,552
Sounds like a big one, too.

646
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,029
Depth.
Depth,

647
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,916
Oh, for a nice torpedo.

648
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,754
Can't be keeping much of a watch
or they'd have seen us at that range.

649
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,876
The lookout's half asleep, I expect.

650
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,797
I can see the Brattholm Islands now.

651
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,836
Course?

652
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,273
182, sir.

653
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,918
Steer 176.

654
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,956
176, sir.

655
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,996
176 now, sir.

656
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,274
- Take her down to 3O feet.
- 3O feet, sir.

657
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,920
You're sure we're in the
right fjord, skipper?

658
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,956
I mean, this is dead easy.

659
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,996
You wait.

660
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,036
I said course 107.

661
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,076
Course is 107, sir.

662
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,116
It bloody well isn't, you know.

663
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,156
Brattholm's dead ahead.

664
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,996
Then gyro's off the board, then, sir.

665
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,036
Any idea what's wrong?

666
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,120
No.

667
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,118
I'd better go aft, switch her off
and open her up, sir.

668
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,156
Come on, quickly.

669
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,038
What's the depth here?

670
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,076
Five fathoms. Shingle and mud, sir.

671
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,628
Well, we'll have to sit
on the bottom and wait.

672
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,676
Take her down.

673
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,512
Gently!

674
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,556
Aye aye, sir.

675
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,596
Slow ahead, group down.

676
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,636
- 25 feet, sir.
- Right, stop motor.

677
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,676
Stop motor.

678
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,670
Seems like the chart was right for once.

679
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,076
(Grinding of metal)

680
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,396
Emergency lighting, Quick!

681
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,752
Stand by to surface.

682
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,592
Stand by to surface, sir.

683
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,636
Shut main vents.

684
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,199
Main vents shut, sir.

685
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,554
Ready to surface, sir.

686
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,359
Surface.

687
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,996
Any more tea?

688
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,073
Yes, sir.

689
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,956
Just 12 miles over there...

690
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,280
..Tirpitz.

691
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,037
Now you mention it,
I can almost smell the sauerkraut.

692
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,076
Recharge batteries now.

693
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,116
Aye aye, sir.

694
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,436
- Captain.
- All right, sir?

695
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,236
(Gargles)

696
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,078
Any movement?

697
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,116
CORBETT: I'm not sure.

698
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,156
Listen!

699
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,518
That's funny. It sounds like music.

700
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,549
(Music on radio)

701
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,596
(Speaks German)

702
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,596
Keep still!

703
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,636
Ersatz.

704
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,393
You stay on watch.

705
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,436
I'll get below and get a move on.

706
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,520
Right.

707
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,876
Well, how is it?

708
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,916
Still showing 296, sir.

709
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,956
We know that's wrong.

710
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,792
Couldn't we go in by periscope?

711
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,314
It's only about ten miles.
We could take it slow.

712
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,359
Supposing something goes wrong with it.
We can't sail entirely blind.

713
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,238
- If we surface, that'd give the game away.
- That's it.

714
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:52,074
On the other hand, we don't know
if the others have even got this far.

715
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,230
We'd look ruddy silly if we turned back

716
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,393
and found out we were the only ones
who had a chance of hitting (he Tirpitz.

717
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,398
All right, then, we'll attack.

718
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:09,837
It'll mean periscope depth all the way -
unless we get too close to a Jerry ship.

719
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,478
Let's take her up.

720
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:20,476
All right.

721
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,313
0300. We're going in.

722
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,274
- Dive, dive, dive.
- Dive, dive, dive, sir.

723
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,516
This is it.

724
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,558
- Dive, dive, dive. 3O feet.
- Dive, dive, dive. 3O feet.

725
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,636
Steer 220,

726
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,676
Steer 220, sir.

727
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,716
Steady on 220, sir.

728
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,876
- Let's help you into this.
- Sir.

729
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,756
30 feet now.

730
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,278
Periscope depth.

731
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,237
Periscope depth, sir.

732
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,276
Periscope depth now.

733
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,558
Net bouys dead ahead.

734
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,756
Small coaster. Red 45.

735
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,232
Stand by to flood W and D.

736
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,993
- Shut No.2 main vent.
- No. 2 main vent shut, sir.

737
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,718
- Shut No.2 Kingston.
- Shut, sir.

738
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,792
- Slow ahead, group down.
- Slow ahead, group down, sir.

739
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,232
(Whining)

740
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,710
- Slow, group down.
- Slow, group down, sir.

741
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,995
Small coaster dead ahead.

742
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,833
Well, I'm damned!
They're opening the boom for her.

743
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,876
Full ahead, group up!

744
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,794
If we can get through that gate,
it will save us hours of wire cutting.

745
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,916
I'll want 20 feet in a minute.

746
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,195
20 feet of lovely water waiting.

747
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,712
Any more urge?

748
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,472
Maximum now, sir.

749
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,475
Don't look now, they're closing the boom.

750
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,073
Quick off the mark, aren't they?

751
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,836
Here we go. Take her down 20 feet.

752
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,596
And hang on.

753
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,676
(Motor whines)

754
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,873
She's not answering, sir.

755
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,876
I've got no control here.

756
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,916
(Scraping grinding)

757
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,430
Blimey! We're through!

758
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,396
Do you know, I believe we are.

759
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,436
Periscope depth.

760
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,476
Periscope depth, sir.

761
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,391
Half ahead, group down.

762
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,436
Take her slowly.

763
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,073
- Open No.2 main vent.
- No. 2 main vent open, sir.

764
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,277
- Open No.2 Kingston.
- No. 2 Kingston open, sir.

765
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,112
Depth.
Depth.

766
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,873
- Are you all right?
- Give us a hand.

767
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,396
Nice work, diver. Have a good swim?

768
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,232
Place is lousy with jellyfish.

769
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,276
Periscope depth.

770
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,589
There she is, large as life.

771
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,636
Larger, in fact.

772
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,479
Ah, my beauts, if you
could see what I can see.

773
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,356
We're gonna get her, after all.

774
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,440
Huh?

775
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,115
Flood Q, full ahead, group up, crash dive!

776
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,873
- Full ahead, group up, crash dive.
- Pray, boys.

777
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,916
(Crashing and splintering)

778
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,153
Periscope gone, sir?

779
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,038
Lucky it wasn't us.

780
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,473
All right, blow Q.

781
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,710
Blow Q, sir. Q blowing, sir.

782
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,756
Bring her up slowly.

783
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,796
Periscope depth. Periscope depth.

784
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,836
Q blown, sir.

785
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:05,276
Periscope depth now.

786
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,672
Can't see a thing.

787
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,273
We're blind.

788
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,193
- No periscope, no compass.
- Too right we're blind!

789
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,280
What now?

790
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,754
Now we just sit on the bottom and wait.

791
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,398
It's all we can do.

792
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,118
We could bail out.

793
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,156
Not yet we couldn't.

794

give the game away for the others.

Not a flicker.

top of eight tons of high explosive.

960
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,399
Eight?

961
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,833
DSEAs, quick!

962
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,399
Shall I flood W and D, sir?

963
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,471
Hell, no. Flood the whole chute.

964
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,073
- Hatch lever jammed.
- Got a battleship on it, that's why.

965
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,316
(Metallic groaning)

966
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:33,270
Get ready to bail out.

967
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:47,720
(Gunfire)

968
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,395

(Shouting in German)

970
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:01,353
- Well, keep trying.
- No good, sir. We've had it.

971
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,390
- Depth?
- 15 feet, sir.

972
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,270
- She's rising. Flood Q.
- Flood Q, sir.

973
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,430
All the tanks are full, sir.
Can't hold her.

974
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,469
Any drift?

975
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,632
If the jar is not busted,
we've swung round and back towards Tirpitz.

976
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,871
That would be lovely.
Right back on top of our own side cargoes.

977
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:24,995
Still rising, sir.

978
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,036
(Orders shouted in German)

979
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,113
(Shouting

980
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,556
- No sign of any of the others.
- No.

981
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,311
What goods he supposed to be?

982
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,879
They think we were using limpets.

983
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,316
He'll have a headache if he's down
there when those charges go off.

984
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,470
- (Shouts in German)
- Don't be like that.

987

Another half hour should
see us out of here.

(Rumbling)

989
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:24,234
- She's floating.
- No, she isn't.

990
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:27,471
- It's the side cargo. It's flooding.
- Not necessarily.

991
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:31,314
- Couldn't be anything else.
- It might be a tide or a strong current.

992
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,197
There's one way of finding out.

993
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,396
- Start the motor.
- Aye aye, sir.

994
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,711
- We're surfacing, sir?
- No, we're not.

995
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,872
- Take it up ten feet when you can.
- Ten feet, sir.

996
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,315
- Slow ahead, group down.
- Slow ahead...

997
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,116
..group down.

998
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,357
Amt-swan.

999
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,432
I knew it. Side cargos flooded.
That's why it keeled over.

1000
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,795
- We're not bailing out.
- But it will blow up.

1001
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,155
We're not giving the game away. All right?

1002
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,878
- They must have got in by now, sir.
- We can't be sure.

1003
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:10,592
One peep out of us
and the whole attack could fail.

1004
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,878
- All right. Stop motor.
- Stop motor, sir.

1005
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,438
Ten feet now.

1006
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:25,114
Going up. Ironmongery and hardware.

1007
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:28,037
Seven feet now, sir.

1008
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:29,678
I can't hold her.

1009
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,399
- All right, stand by to surface.
- Stand by to surface, sir.

1010
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,711
- Can you blow any tanks?
- Only number two, sir. Now?

1011
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,756
Right,

1012
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,796
(Whooshing)
. Right, at.

1013

Cor blimey!
They got the ruddy cooks on that gun.

1018
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:22,519
Stand by to bail out.

1019
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,556
Might as well be shot as drowned I suppose.

1020
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,596
Bail out!

1021
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,235
(Shouts orders in German)

1022
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,231
They're picking them up.

1023
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,749
Hello. Here comes the executioner.

1024
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,836
Hans!

1025
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,233
Schnapps.

1026
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,312
Cor blimey! Here you are, skip, have a tot.

1027
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,356
(Shouts orders in German)

1028
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,236
Quite a tea party. What happened?

1029
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,039
We got stuck under this hulk.
Park yours all right, sir?

1030
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,032
Yep. Dead under number one engine room.
And you?

1031
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,112
- Right on top of yours.
- Ought to be quite a bang.

1032
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:59,794
So they got eight tons of amatol
underneath them.

1033
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,553
- What are they gonna do about it?
- They're getting up steam.

1034
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,517
- Yes, sir.
- Hell.

1035
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,556
15 minutes to go yet.

1036
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:10,559
- No sign of Duffy?
- No, sir.

1037
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,555
- Still flooding?
- Can't tell.

1038
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,311
There's no more list.

1039
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,516
They don't always explode when they flood.

1040
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,875
Yes they bloody well do and we all know it.

1041
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,833
- I'm all right.
- Sure you're all right.

Nein, nein, nein. (Speaks German)

1045
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,429
They've only got to move it
a few feet to one side.

1046
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:08,476
- They don't know that.
- Yet.

1047
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,156
Let's stall it.

1048
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,594
- You, sir, command this party?
- No.

1049
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,476
Are you in charge of this party?

1050
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,798
- Excuse me?
- Are you commander of this party?

1051
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,316
Oh, yes... Yes, I am.

1052
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:34,274
We wish to know immediately what
kind of charge have you employed.

1053
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,316
I beg your pardon?

1054
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,478
We want to know what kind of explosives
you have used.

1055
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,396
Yes, I'm sure you do.

1056
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:47,477
You realise that you are in danger with us.

1057
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:50,953
- Do you realise that, Corbett?
- No, sir, I didn't.

1058
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,349
What's the time?

1059
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,635
- Ten minutes to, sir.
- Yes, we do.

1060
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:59,430
Now listen, all of you.

1061
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,310
You'll be sent to prison camp, in any case.

1062
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:06,597
If you tell us the nature and position
of your explosives,

1063
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,556
we can make things easier for you.

1064
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,350
Eight minutes to go, sir.

1065
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,994
They must move her. They're not crazy.

1066
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:30,038
Here. Do you think we could move along
the deck a bit?

1067
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,997
Not a chance. Why?

1068
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,469
I reckon we're plum on top of the charges,
that's all.
