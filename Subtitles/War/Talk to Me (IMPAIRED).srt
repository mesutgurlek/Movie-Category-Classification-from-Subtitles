1
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,190
Wake up, God damn it!

2
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:32,527
I know it's hard.

3
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:36,572
Your eyes is burning,
slowly opening.

4
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:39,992
You slowly realizing
that this wasn't no dream.

5
00:01:40,075 --> 00:01:41,994
No, this is your life.

6
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:32,957
Yeah, right about now you're looking
at them cold walls that surround you,

7
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:36,419
and you wondering,
"How the hell did I get up in this joint, Jack?

8
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,088
"And how the fuck
I'm gonna get out?"

9
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:55,770
(BUZZING)

10
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:03,360
But you know what they say:
"It's like life, y'all.

11
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:06,071
PETEY ON P.
A...: "Ain't no way to it, but to do it."

12
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:11,242
So reach on up there and scratch
another day off the wall, man.

13
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:13,161
But don't be whining.

14
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:14,328
Uh-uh.

15
00:03:14,412 --> 00:03:16,789
Ain't gonna be no signal fire.

16
00:03:16,872 --> 00:03:18,499
Just take a stand.

17
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:20,251
Be a man.
It's good to see you, man.

18
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:22,628
And try to understand.
Hey, listen, man. Listen.

19
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:24,671
You ain't in here
'cause of the master's plan.

20
00:03:24,713 --> 00:03:27,007
No, you in here
'cause you fucked up!

21
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,678
Look, this is the nigga that I've been writing you about.
You dig?

22
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:34,889
Yo, I was reading my court
papers the other day, y'all.

23
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:40,394
They say, "Ralph Waldo 'Petey' Greene
versus the United States of America."

24
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:43,897
I say, "Goddamn!
No wonder I'm up in this motherfucker!"

25
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:48,485
So I'm gonna dedicate
this next one to my baby.

26
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:53,031
Man, she gonna be up here in a minute,
and this gal, Lord have mercy,

27
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:54,907
she's fine as frogs, yeah.

28
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:58,828
So while this is playing,
I want y'all to think about the one y'all love.

29
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:00,913
And I'm talking about the one
sends you them pictures, man,

30
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:03,248
not the cat in the next bunk.

31
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:06,752
I guess you're pretty hard up
for entertainment around here.

32
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:08,878
Yeah, man. This is prison.

33
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:11,756
Whatever gets you through
twenty-to-life.

34
00:04:16,052 --> 00:04:17,678
I got a meeting.

35
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:20,139
You...

36
00:04:23,308 --> 00:04:25,602
You need anything?
I don't need shit.

37
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:26,812
Okay.

38
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,815
Let me ask you something.
Why do you even bother?

39
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,901
Because I promised Mama.

40
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:38,447
Don't do me no fucking favors.

41
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:59,133
(BUZZING)

42
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,429
Hello, Vernell.

43
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:11,394
That's the booty line.

44
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,313
Conjugal visits.

45
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,650
(VERNELL EXCLAIMING)

46
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:26,575
Hay. Hey, Radio man! Hey!

47
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:30,328
So Milo been telling you
about me, huh?

48
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,496
What?

49
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:33,956
Milo. Your brother?

50
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,876
Said y'all need a new DJ
at that radio station.

51
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,502
Hey, I'm your man.

52
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,504
My brother wouldn't know.

53
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:43,715
And in case you forgot,
you're in prison.

54
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,133
It's a minor challenge.

55
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:46,760
You're a miscreant.

56
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:49,804
That's more than
a minor challenge.

57
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:51,848
The fuck this nigga call me?
A Miss who?

58
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,391
A miscreant.

59
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:54,934
A convict.

60
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:56,936
(LAUGHING)

61
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,689
Listen to this nigga!
I'm a miscreant!

62
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:02,775
Well, you know what?
I like that shit!

63
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,235
'Cause that makes me sound
like a con with class.

64
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,029
Hey, Ralph Waldo
"Petey" Greene,

65
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:09,739
miscreant mack
at your service.

66
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:12,242
You forgot "felon."

67
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:13,785
"Lowlife."

68
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:17,371
So do that mean
I got a job or what?

69
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:19,832
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

70
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:22,960
I need you to do me a favor,
sugar. Okay?

71
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:25,921
I need you to go home
and take this

72
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:28,715
right on down to Nighthawk
for me, okay?

73
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:30,675
Here.

74
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:32,594
Here!

75
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:34,387
Come on, take it!

76
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,013
Here!

77
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:38,599
Ain't no padding in there,
sweetie.

78
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:40,809
You tell him
it's all me, okay?

79
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:42,186
PETEY: Vernell.

80
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:45,105
What?
You don't get your ass in that room...

81
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:46,440
Oh, shut up.
It's just a bra.

82
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:48,275
Hey, radio man!

83
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:49,359
You better come on!

84
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,152
I'm gonna look you up
when I get out of here, man.

85
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,904
Yeah?
How many years you pulling?

86
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:54,030
Five to ten.

87
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,699
Nickel to a dime.
It ain't shit, baby.

88
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:57,950
You do that.

89
00:06:57,992 --> 00:07:01,287
I'm the best there is, baby.
I'm the greatest!

90
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:03,914
I'm the greatest
of all time, baby!

91
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,418
NIGHTHAWK: This is
The Nighthawk Show,

92
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:12,922
doing it for all those fine young
things down at Howard University.

93
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:16,509
The Love Hawk
with you all night,

94
00:07:16,592 --> 00:07:19,470
rocking your radio
in the nation's capital.

95
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:24,891
It's 5:10 on the
Sounds of Soul, the big O-L.

96
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:27,477
We keep losing ground to WOOK.

97
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:31,564
We can make up the lost ground on OK, sir.
I mean, we have a very exciting slate.

98
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:33,858
Great music, talk... Sounds good,
but it's not working.

99
00:07:33,941 --> 00:07:35,443
What's the problem?

100
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:37,570
The problem is we've lost
touch with the real DC

101
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:40,239
in our attempts
to win over the Beltway.

102
00:07:40,322 --> 00:07:42,408
This has always been
a station of the people

103
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:44,868
and in case you forgot,
most of the people don't live in Georgetown.

104
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,536
Yeah, but the people who live
in Georgetown

105
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,122
do shop at Giant Foods
and Woody's.

106
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:50,582
Sponsors that pay your salary.

107
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:54,043
No. I pay his salary,
and yours.

108
00:07:55,503 --> 00:07:58,547
Maybe I should start paying
your salary to him.

109
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:01,925
Sir, I think...
I'm serious.

110
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,219
What do you say, Dewey?

111
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:07,222
You think
you can turn us around?

112
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:09,516
Yes sir, I do.
Good.

113
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,101
Let's give it a try.

114
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:16,230
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

115
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:19,400
MAN: Sir, I just need
a minute of your time, please.

116
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:23,695
PETEY: Hey, y'all, guess what?
I found out today I ain't a con, y'all.

117
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:25,072
For real.

118
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:30,076
I am not a con,
or a felon, or a thug.

119
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,413
No. I am a miscreant.

120
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:34,747
(LAUGHS)

121
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,415
Now, y'all know what that is?
Good morning.

122
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:40,127
That's a con, brother.
A felon, a thug.

123
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:42,796
We ain't in prison.

124
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,757
No, this
a correctional facility.

125
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,511
See, when you broke into
that car, or shot that nigga,

126
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:52,305
it wasn't 'cause you a wrong-doing motherfucker, no.

127
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,016
No, see,
you troubled, brother.

128
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:57,018
You disenfranchised.

129
00:08:57,435 --> 00:09:01,605
ANNOUNCER: The Tonight Show
Starring Johnny Carson. And now...

130
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:05,442
PETEY: All this wordplay so that
we don't have to face the truth.

131
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:10,280
'Cause the truth is,
no matter how many ways you try to slice it,

132
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:12,490
I'm a con.

133
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:15,827
OFFICER: Lights out!

134
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:19,163
And you a con, too.

135

POOCHIE: (SINGING) Warden's got a little dick!
Warden's got a little dick!

136
00:09:26,503 --> 00:09:29,005
Yeah! Come on, Warden!
What you got?

137
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,007
You got that little dick?

138
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:32,884
Who the hell is that man
on my tower?

139
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:36,345
Braxton, Poochie, sir.
Ten-to-fifteen, armed robbery.

140
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:37,930
(INMATES YELLING)

141
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:42,476
Hey, Warden! You got a little, itty-bitty dick!
That's right! That's you, Warden!

142
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,228
Shoot him.
Sir?

143
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,104
Right between the eyes.

144
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:48,732
I don't know
if we can do that, legally.

145
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:51,651
Technically,
he's not trying to escape.

146
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:53,861
Well, where in hell can I shoot him, then?
Listen here!

147
00:09:53,945 --> 00:09:57,490
I want Petey Greene!

148
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:59,492
You hear me, Warden?

149
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:03,078
I want you to get Petey Greene
out here, right now.

150
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:07,040
Petey! Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey! Petey!

151
00:10:07,082 --> 00:10:08,875
POOCHIE: What's he gonna do?

152
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:10,877
Where Petey at?

153
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,087
Oh, yo, Petey!

154
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,214
(WHOOPING)

155
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:18,259
Yeah. Look,
you got a little dick!

156
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,887
Warden! Your dick, Warden!

157
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:25,891
Look like you got

00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:32,360
And you ain't shit out here.

468
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:35,821
Are you through?

469
00:26:36,572 --> 00:26:38,365
Knock 'em down, champ.

470
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,791
MAN: All right. Come on.
Come on. PETEY: Baby.

471
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:49,709
MAN 1: Yeah.
MAN 2: There it go!

472
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,212
Damn!

473
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,798
Too bad, big time.

474
00:26:57,341 --> 00:26:59,135
I had faith in you.

475
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:03,805
(CHATTERING)

476
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:06,933
One ball, corner.

477
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:14,190
Two ball, side pocket.

478
00:27:17,651 --> 00:27:20,070
Three ball, corner.

479
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:24,408
See, negroes always think that
if you speak correct English,

480
00:27:24,491 --> 00:27:27,035
or you wear clothes
other than clown suits,

481
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,078
that you're not real.

482
00:27:28,328 --> 00:27:30,455
Four ball, side pocket.

483
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:36,085
And to you, what's real is
a nigga loud-mouthing, right?

484
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:40,714
Telling everybody how bad he is
while he's looking for a handout.

485
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:42,216
Five.

486
00:27:44,218 --> 00:27:46,970
But you give him a chance
to take what's his,

487
00:27:47,721 --> 00:27:50,181
and he can't sink
one single ball.

488
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:51,391
Six.

489
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:58,606
Lucky seven!

490
00:27:59,732 --> 00:28:01,233
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

491
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:03,110
Now, you were so busy
running your mouth,

492
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:07,155
you never really asked yourself
why I chose a pool hall to meet.

493
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:11,451
'Cause this uppity nigga could never
have grown up in these projects,

494
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:14,162
or made his way through school

495
00:28:14,203 --> 00:28:17,540
hustling dumbass niggas
who thought he wasn't down.

496
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,466
They call me Mr. Hughes.

497
00:28:37,391 --> 00:28:39,852
Grew up
in the Anacostia projects.

498
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,861
This con climbed the tower
in the yard back in Lorton.

499
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:51,988
He up there, man,
he's talking real...

500
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,407
You know, unflattering
about the warden's dick.

501
00:28:54,449 --> 00:28:56,450
Nobody could talk
this cat down.

502
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:57,910
So they call Petey Greene,
man,

503
00:28:57,993 --> 00:29:00,371
I talked this cat down
in five minutes, man.

504
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,540
Let's just say the warden was
very, very grateful.

505
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:05,125
Five minutes, huh?
Mmm-hmm.

506
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:07,460
But what the warden don't know

507
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:12,257
is it took me six months to talk that
crazy nigga up there in the first place!

508
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:20,055
Let me ask you something.

509
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:23,225
Why?

510
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:27,687
Why you want to be on the radio so bad
that you're gonna go through all this?

511
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:31,483
Oh, man, it's what I do, man.
It's my thing, you know?

512
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:34,986
I started off making them daily
announcements back at Lorton

513
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:38,948
as part of the work program,
you know? A reward for good behavior.

514
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:41,950
Couple years later,
I convinced them to let me play this record

515
00:29:41,992 --> 00:29:45,412
that my Aunt Pig had sent me,
a Sam Cooke record, man, A Change Is Gonna Come.

516
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:47,330
That's an incredible song.

517
00:29:47,414 --> 00:29:51,376
She sent me that record, you know,
to try and give me a little hope,

518
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:53,294
and I wanted to play it
for the men in them cells,

519
00:29:53,336 --> 00:29:55,129
you know, give them some hope.

520
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:57,256
And I'm telling you, man,

521
00:29:57,465 --> 00:30:02,177
it's the only thing that kept me from going
stone-crazy behind them walls, man.

522
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,930
And now that I'm out,
I still need that.

523
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,807
Why should I put my ass on the
line to give you a shot, Petey?

524
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:11,019
Nigga... 'Cause Petey Greene is the real deal, Jack!

525
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:16,190
Shit! I swear to God, I mean,
he is the sho'nuff, I mean, pimp...

526
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,652
Sorry.
It's okay.

527
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,821
See, what this pretty lady
is trying to tell you is that,

528
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,198
man, being a DJ, that's
the only thing I'm good at

529
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,826
that don't involve me
breaking no law.

530
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:31,996
And shit, since you here
sharing a drink,

531
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,917
I'm gonna assume that you need
a man of my particular talents.

532
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,837
Three rules.

533
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:42,131
One,

534
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:45,092
always know
more than your audience.

535
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:47,844
Two, you talk shit,
you back it up.

536
00:30:47,886 --> 00:30:49,888
And three, don't you ever,

537
00:30:51,055 --> 00:30:52,181
never, ever,

538
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:54,183
underestimate me again.

539
00:30:54,725 --> 00:30:56,352
What are you talking about,
man?

540
00:30:56,435 --> 00:31:00,231
I'm gonna give you one more
chance to knock in that nine ball.

541
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:04,985
Tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.,
WOL, Studio One. Be on time.

542
00:31:06,653 --> 00:31:07,988
Be sober.

543
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:09,948
And definitely

544
00:31:11,407 --> 00:31:12,992
be by yourself.

545
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,160
(STAMMERING)

546
00:31:14,243 --> 00:31:16,579
You my kind of nigga, Hughes!

547
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:18,372
You my kind of motherfucker,
Hughes!

548
00:31:18,414 --> 00:31:21,000
We love you!
We love you!

549
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,418
Oh my God!

550
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:24,503
(EXCLAIMING)

551
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:27,380
We need to make
a personnel change.

552
00:31:27,464 --> 00:31:29,215
Really? Who?

553
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:30,633
Sunny Jim.

554
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:32,719
You're not serious.

555
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:36,013
Sir, morning shows are becoming
more than just a leisurely stroll.

556
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:37,348
We have to compete here.

557
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:39,266
WOOK is killing us
in the morning.

558
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,102
But Sunny Jim is a DC icon!

559
00:31:42,186 --> 00:31:45,439
Everyone loves Sunny Jim.
He's so sunny.

560
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,857
No sir, you love Sunny Jim.

561
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,734
Sunny Jim is a relic
of a bygone radio age.

562
00:31:49,818 --> 00:31:51,778
We don't play Nat "King" Cole
or The Drifters anymore.

563
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:53,404
And our DJ's have
to reflect that.

564
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:56,073
That's why we have Nighthawk
and Soul Papa.

565
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:59,451
I'm not turning this into some kind of
teenybopper American Bandstand.

566
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:01,286
We're a respectable
R&B station.

567
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:04,790
With all due respect, sir,
this is not a respectable town.

568
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:06,291
This is DC.

569
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:07,709
You see them out
on the mall every day,

570
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,253
protesting the so-called
respectable establishment.

571
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:13,923
We can't become the establishment,
or they'll turn on us.

572
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:22,139
Who do you have in mind?

573
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:24,766
Well, sir, I found a DJ
from an out-of-town station.

574
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,144
He has a major following,

575
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:30,772
and he's recently
been released

576
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:32,523
from his contract.

577
00:32:37,695 --> 00:32:40,948
Jim, come back here, please.
It's nothing personal.

578
00:32:42,157 --> 00:32:44,326
Oh, shit! I'm sorry...

579
00:32:44,368 --> 00:32:45,994
Watch where the hell
you're going!

580
00:32:46,078 --> 00:32:47,537
All right, man.

581
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:50,665
Oh, no.
PETEY: Hey, sugar!

582
00:32:50,748 --> 00:32:52,834
You know the drill.
Call your man.

583
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:54,293
I don't think so.

584
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:55,795
Let me ask you something.

585
00:32:55,878 --> 00:32:57,546
You ever had anybody
eat your pussy?

586
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,881
Mr. Sonderling!

587
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:03,051
What's wrong, Freda?

588
00:33:03,552 --> 00:33:06,096
Oh, God. Blue Blazes.
How the radio business?

589
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,973
I put up with your
shenanigans out front

590
00:33:08,056 --> 00:33:09,724
for a week, Mr. Brown.
Greene.

591
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,768
All right, Mr. Green,
what do you want now?

592
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:13,394
I'm your DJ, man!

593
00:33:13,478 --> 00:33:14,896
Freda, call the police.

594
00:33:14,937 --> 00:33:18,774
God damn! Y'all got some hospitality
issues around this motherfucker!

595
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,734
You're cutting it close.

596
00:33:20,776 --> 00:33:23,654
What can I say, man?
Had to get my vine together.

597
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:25,072
Your vine?
Yeah.

598
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:26,490
You're going on the...

599
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:27,532
Fuck.

600
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:29,576
Mr. Sonderling,

601
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:33,329
this is our new morning DJ.

602
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:40,586
I've been hoodwinked!

603
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:42,754
Come on.

604
00:33:42,838 --> 00:33:47,259
You are out of your mind if you think
I'm gonna put this person on the air.

605
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,551
Sir, I know
this is unorthodox...

606
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,136
Unorthodox? It's insane!

607
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,096
Sir, hear me out.
This man has a unique voice.

608
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:54,390
I just have a feeling...
I have much more than just a feeling.

609
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:57,268
Sir, we need to put somebody on the air
in the next two minutes or we go black.

610
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,436
Black, black, black.

611
00:34:02,815 --> 00:34:05,108
Freda, run after Jim, he might
still be in the building!

612
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,526
Sir, we don't have time.

613
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,404
You're just gonna have
to trust me. One show.

614
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:11,656
One shot.

615
00:34:14,158 --> 00:34:16,410
Our morning show's already
in the toilet.

616
00:34:16,494 --> 00:34:18,954
We don't have a thing to lose.
You don't have a thing to lose!

617
00:34:19,038 --> 00:34:21,957
FREDA ON INTERCOM: Sir,
it's one minute to air, and Jim's gone.

618
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:24,001
Oh, for crying out loud.

619
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:27,337
It's my own fault
for listening to you.

620
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:32,634
All right, one show, one shot.

621
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:35,011
I want you on air with him.
You can introduce him.

622
00:34:35,052 --> 00:34:37,221

Well, I got an eighth-grade education
with a Ph.D. From the streets.

I'm a recovering alcoholic,

I gotta apologize about something that I
said a little earlier that upset some folks.

I gotta apologize
to Mr. Berry Gordy

722
00:40:22,037 --> 00:40:25,082
for making him out
to be a hustler and a pimp.

723
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,795
Mr. Gordy's a very important man,
and he's done a great deal.

724
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:37,093
And I love the way he takes
the little brothers and sisters,

725
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:41,680
broke-down runaways,
the downtrodden from the projects,

726
00:40:41,722 --> 00:40:44,182
and he gets them
off the streets.

727
00:40:44,516 --> 00:40:48,728
Then he puts a few dollars in their pockets,
teaches them how to talk and how to walk,

728
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:52,315
then sends them right back out there
to bring him a whole lot of money.

729
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:56,652
So I'm sorry if in any way
I made him out to be a pimp.

his black ass off the air.

Berry Gordy is
a stand-up brother.

778
00:43:12,443 --> 00:43:16,447
Don't nobody want to hear some con talking
mess about somebody like Berry Gordy.

779
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,573
Right.
Come on.

780
00:43:17,656 --> 00:43:21,827
I would rather listen to a con than
this sucker-for-love-ass nigga.

Petey Greene was cool,
but that white boy that was with him...

Yeah.

Guys, drinks are on me, okay?

See that, now,
I could get with that.

787
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:39,593
Thank you, my brother.
Thank you, my brother.

788

Yo, bartender.
Thank you.

789
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,180
Right on.
How much you leaving, man?

Hey, hey. Keep it coming.
Right on, Kevin.

the world, radio man?

Let me ask you something, man.

794
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,293
Why, huh?

795
00:44:17,003 --> 00:44:19,964
Why should I put my ass
on the line for you?

796
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:25,886
Why should I give up
all this right here

797
00:44:26,219 --> 00:44:28,263
and take a chance on you?

798

I guess I need you

to say the things
I'm afraid to say.

do the things
you're afraid to do.

802

Yeah. It was good, man.

No, I just checked.

in the men's room.

You go get him.
I'll stall in there for a couple of minutes, okay?

I'm telling it.

gonna keep on telling it.

Good morning, WOL.

Yes, ma'am, he is,

Hold it. You can't give

We'll talk. We'll talk, okay?

I want him on a short leash.
A very short leash.

in your contract.

Fine, man, whatever.
I'll sign it.

Jim, wait up.

00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:09,047
Can I get back to work?

929
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,174
All right. But you watch your language.
All right!

930
00:51:11,257 --> 00:51:14,218
And you keep an eye on him.
Thank you, sir.

931
00:51:14,969 --> 00:51:17,221
All right,
let's get busy here.

932
00:51:17,304 --> 00:51:19,348
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

933
00:51:24,686 --> 00:51:26,521
I love that song!

934
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:28,857
Reminds me of summertime
on the beach

935
00:51:28,898 --> 00:51:31,859
trying to get some foxy coed
to rub some lotion on me.

936
00:51:31,901 --> 00:51:33,236
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

937
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:36,447
Well, in case you been asleep at the wheel,
this is Petey Greene.

938
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:37,531
Hello, caller,
what's your name?

939
00:51:37,615 --> 00:51:39,533
And you ain't in Washington,
DC no more, Dorothy.

940
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:40,868
No, this is P-Town.
All right, Tom, please hold.

941
00:51:40,909 --> 00:51:42,578
Hello, caller,
what's your name? WOL-AM.

942
00:51:42,661 --> 00:51:43,203
Hello, James.

943
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:45,497
(FUNK MUSIC PLAYING)

944
00:52:09,769 --> 00:52:12,105
My granny,
I call her Aunt Pig,

945
00:52:12,188 --> 00:52:15,942
Aunt Pig say, "Petey,
why you always in jail?"

946
00:52:16,525 --> 00:52:19,570
I tell her I don't know.
"I don't know, Aunt Pig."

947
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:22,614
Then one day
I read my indictment papers,

948
00:52:22,656 --> 00:52:27,994
they say, "Ralph Waldo Greene
versus the United States of America."

949
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,955
I said, "Damn! No wonder
I ain't been winning!"

950
00:52:30,997 --> 00:52:32,248
He's talking about...

951
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:35,835
And I don't care what nobody say,
ain't nothing like a black woman.

952
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:38,587
Now, that ain't to say
I ain't dabbled before.

953
00:52:38,671 --> 00:52:41,882
I mean, I dabbled, man,
I'm a good old dabbler.

954
00:52:42,132 --> 00:52:47,095
But give me a sister with big hips,
big legs and a big old 'fro,

955
00:52:47,179 --> 00:52:50,140
and you ain't got to worry
about me no more.

956
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,852
NIGHTHAWK: Hey, hey, hey!
Fan mail.

957
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:57,355
How many for The Hawk?

958
00:52:59,481 --> 00:53:00,816
Three?

959
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:02,151
Sorry.

960
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:05,570
Gave you one of Petey's.

961
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:09,616
Y'all listen everyday, huh?

962
00:53:12,452 --> 00:53:13,453
Ain't you, now!

963
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:14,829
Check it out.
Yeah.

964
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:26,214
Talk to me, Petey! Talk to me!

965
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:29,175
Talk to me! Want me to talk to you?
I'll talk to you.

966
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:31,386
(SCREAMS)

967
00:53:31,469 --> 00:53:32,970
God damn it!

968
00:53:35,514 --> 00:53:36,932
Oh, baby.

969
00:53:37,016 --> 00:53:38,684
Let me explain.
I'm listening.

970
00:53:38,726 --> 00:53:39,935
Girl, put the bottle down

971
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:42,312
and let me talk to you.
Go on, Petey. I'm listening.

972
00:53:42,396 --> 00:53:46,149
"Talk to me, Petey. Talk to me, baby."
Ain't what the bitch said?

973
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:51,029
You tell this bitch how I was the only
one to give your sorry ass a place to stay

974
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:53,364
when you had nowhere else
to go. Tell this bitch!

975
00:53:53,406 --> 00:53:54,574
She took me in.

976
00:53:54,657 --> 00:53:57,701
I cleaned your clothes,
and I cooked your food,

977
00:53:57,743 --> 00:53:59,453
motherfucker!
Oh, shit. Okay! Okay!

978
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:01,914
Vernell, please. Baby,
listen, now. Don't do this.

979
00:54:01,997 --> 00:54:03,916
You don't wanna
do this here. Hold on.

980
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:06,501
Listen, I'm sorry.

981
00:54:06,585 --> 00:54:07,877
I fucked up.
Yeah, you fucked up.

982
00:54:07,919 --> 00:54:11,464
I did. I fucked up.
I know it, baby. I know it.

983
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:15,009
And I ain't trying to make no excuses for it.
But you don't wanna do this here.

984
00:54:15,092 --> 00:54:18,304
Vernell. Come on, baby,
put the bottle down.

985
00:54:19,763 --> 00:54:21,098
(SOBBING)

986
00:54:21,515 --> 00:54:22,766
Get out.

987
00:54:25,936 --> 00:54:28,438
Nigga, didn't you hear?
I said get out! This is my joint.

988
00:54:28,521 --> 00:54:30,356
I don't give a fuck, Petey!
Get out!

989
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,233
Let me put some drawers on or something.
Get the fuck out!

990
00:54:32,275 --> 00:54:34,652
Don't make me say it again,
nigga. I swear to God,

991
00:54:34,735 --> 00:54:37,988
I don't wanna get more upset
than I already am with this bottle

992
00:54:38,072 --> 00:54:39,573
and get jumpy
and cut your dick off.

993
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:42,910
You'll be sounding like Frankie Lyman on the radio.
Get the fuck out!

994
00:54:42,951 --> 00:54:44,119
All right.

995
00:54:44,202 --> 00:54:46,121
Get out.
I'm leaving.

996
00:54:49,207 --> 00:54:51,459
Vernell! Baby...

997
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:52,669
(KNOCKING)

998
00:54:53,169 --> 00:54:56,255
Help a nigga out, now.
Come on.

999
00:54:56,297 --> 00:54:57,631
Come on, man.
You gotta be shitting me.

1000
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:59,466
Look at me, man!
I don't want to look at you!

1001
00:54:59,508 --> 00:55:01,969
I wanna get this image out of my head.
Dewey, Dewey, Dewey, listen.

1002
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:05,055
Now, Vernell kicked me out the house.
Caught me fucking some other broad, man.

1003
00:55:05,138 --> 00:55:06,098
I ain't got
nowhere else to go.

1004
00:55:06,181 --> 00:55:08,725
You should have thought about that
before you let your snake out the cage.

1005
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:10,268
Listen, man,
my snake's been incarcerated!

1006
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:13,855
I've been jacking off to girlie
magazines for nine damn years.

1007
00:55:13,938 --> 00:55:16,440
Come on,
you telling me you gonna pass up some fine-ass woman

1008
00:55:16,524 --> 00:55:17,983
just throw her pussy
all up on your face?

1009
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:19,235
Hey, Dave.

1010
00:55:19,318 --> 00:55:21,070
Hey, Dave!
Get in here. Come on.

1011
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:22,821
Just helping out...

1012
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:26,199
My motherfucking deuce!

1013
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:33,164
Susan, this is Petey Greene.
His girlfriend kicked him out, so we gotta...

1014
00:55:33,206 --> 00:55:34,707
I'll leave you two alone.
No, no, no, no, baby.

1015
00:55:34,749 --> 00:55:37,209
No, no, there's no need
for that. You... Just...

1016
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,795
Is this what you mean by taking
your work home with you?

1017
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:41,755
Being married to your career?
Listen, listen...

1018
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:44,007
I should have known.
Come on, help me out here.

1019
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,134
No, no, no, no, no... Hey!

1020
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,054
Damn!

1021
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:54,642
Man, ain't that a bitch?
Women, man. I'm telling you.

1022
00:55:55,434 --> 00:56:00,189
PETEY: (SINGING)
I've been loving you...

1023
00:56:02,524 --> 00:56:05,569
too long, Vernell

1024
00:56:06,403 --> 00:56:09,447
to stop now

1025
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:17,580
You are...

1026
00:56:19,415 --> 00:56:20,958
(WHISPERING)
Shut the hell up, man.

1027
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,334
Put that on!

1028
00:56:25,003 --> 00:56:26,796
I'm sorry, Dewey.

1029
00:56:32,593 --> 00:56:34,387
I fucked up, man.

1030
00:56:34,428 --> 00:56:35,721
Oh, shit.

1031
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:38,808
I fucked up, didn't I?

1032
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,897
Shit. Just...

1033
00:56:47,315 --> 00:56:52,987
Just give her a chance to cool off, man,
and then you'll talk, okay?

1034
00:56:53,071 --> 00:56:56,073
(SOBBING) She don't wanna
talk to me. She mad at me.

1035
00:56:56,157 --> 00:57:00,786
She loves you.
She loves you, okay?

1036
00:57:00,828 --> 00:57:02,329
Yeah.
Okay?

1037
00:57:02,371 --> 00:57:04,289
Yeah. Yeah.

1038
00:57:05,999 --> 00:57:07,834
You're a good friend, Dewey.

1039
00:57:07,918 --> 00:57:09,502
Okay.

1040
00:57:09,586 --> 00:57:12,463
You're a good friend. Yeah.
Yeah, it's... Okay, man.

1041
00:57:12,505 --> 00:57:14,882
Thank you, man.
Okay! Okay! Okay. Come on.

1042
00:57:14,966 --> 00:57:16,217
Okay.

1043
00:57:21,263 --> 00:57:22,848
Get some sleep.

1044
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,518
Get some sleep.

1045
00:57:28,687 --> 00:57:30,980
I'll talk to you in the morning, Dewey. Tomorrow.

1046
00:57:31,064 --> 00:57:33,066
Okay.
In the morning, man.

1047
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:34,692

Oh, man.

1051
00:57:49,205 --> 00:57:52,500
I appreciate, you know,
you letting me stay at your place again, bro, but...

1052
00:57:52,542 --> 00:57:53,709
Come on, man.
Good night, sir.

1053
00:57:53,793 --> 00:57:55,127
Gonna have to give me
some more threads. I can't...

1054
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:57,171
I'm not giving you
any more of my clothes.

1055
00:57:57,254 --> 00:57:58,339
Man...

1056
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,591
Good night, Mike.
Good night.

1057
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:01,842
Good night, Jim.
Good night.

"Have a nice weekend."

1060
00:58:05,095 --> 00:58:06,513
I don't talk like that.

1061
00:58:06,555 --> 00:58:08,390
Yeah, you talk
exactly like that.

1062
00:58:08,431 --> 00:58:11,184
And you walk like you got a
stick broke off in your ass, man.

1063
00:58:11,226 --> 00:58:13,019
I walk with confidence,
like Johnny Carson.

1064
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:16,230
You could learn something
from him. Good night...

1065
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:18,941
Those are my gators, man.

1066

This all my...

1067
00:58:31,202 --> 00:58:32,912
Is she still here?

1068
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:49,260
Now we're even.

1069
00:58:55,516 --> 00:58:57,560
Oh, no, she didn't.
Hold on. Hold on.

1070
00:58:57,643 --> 00:58:59,645
No, she... You don't understand.
Calm down, Petey.

1071
00:58:59,728 --> 00:59:01,897
Move, Dewey, move!
Calm down.

1072

You enjoy yourself, nigga?

1073
00:59:05,317 --> 00:59:07,152
Don't blame me.
It's the voice.

1074
00:59:07,235 --> 00:59:08,528
Oh, is it?

1075
00:59:09,487 --> 00:59:11,948
Oh, fuck. Okay,
hold on, now, let me...

Sonderling, he tried to kill me!

1078
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:39,974
He tried to kill me.

1079

I'm gonna need you
on the air, right away.

01:15:21,936 --> 01:15:26,023
PETEY ON LOUDSPEAKER: Now,
DC is Chocolate City, y'all know that's right.

1233
01:15:26,107 --> 01:15:29,568
Now they wanna keep us down,
'cause they afraid of what's gonna happen

1234
01:15:29,652 --> 01:15:31,695
if we stand up.

1235
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:34,573
Why do you think
they send our boys off to war

1236
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:38,118
instead of keeping them in school,
where they can learn to score?

1237
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:39,327
Yeah!
Yeah!

1238
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,288
Because the white folk know
that if we stand tall,

1239
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:46,167
oh, buddy,
we gonna have something called Black Power, y'all!

1240
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:51,463
Right? All of y'all
look beautiful today.

1241
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,342
Psychologist asked me what I thought
about the word "nigger." I said...

1242
01:15:55,425 --> 01:16:00,179
Lady, "nigger" is the greatest
stress reliever ever invented.

1243
01:16:00,263 --> 01:16:04,183
See, white man say "nigger,"
he ready for a six-month hibernation, am I right?

1244
01:16:04,267 --> 01:16:05,434
But, see, a black man,

1245
01:16:05,518 --> 01:16:09,980
he could say "honkey," "ofay,"
"cracker," "peckerwood"

1246
01:16:10,064 --> 01:16:11,190
a million times,

1247
01:16:11,273 --> 01:16:13,275
still wanna go out there
and kill somebody.

1248
01:16:13,817 --> 01:16:17,862
You're gonna to have to tone it down, Petey.
I've got the FCC all over my rear.

1249
01:16:17,946 --> 01:16:21,658
Well, with all due respect,
sir, the FCC can kiss my ass.

1250
01:16:21,741 --> 01:16:23,618
I ain't saying nothing
but the truth.

1251
01:16:23,701 --> 01:16:24,910
As long as the people
wanna hear it,

1252
01:16:24,994 --> 01:16:26,162
I'm gonna keep telling it.

1253
01:16:26,203 --> 01:16:27,913
I'm gonna talk it
on the radio,

1254
01:16:27,997 --> 01:16:29,581
and I'm gonna talk it
on the streets.

1255
01:16:29,665 --> 01:16:31,250
I'm gonna talk it
to the police,

1256
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:33,210
and even that sucker,
Tricky Dick!

1257
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:38,673
This is P-Town, baby.
Talk to y'all tomorrow.

1258
01:16:42,385 --> 01:16:44,637
Now, that was a good one, Dew.

1259
01:16:46,263 --> 01:16:48,182
That was a great show, Petey.
Right on.

1260
01:16:48,224 --> 01:16:49,850
That was a great show.

1261
01:16:50,893 --> 01:16:52,853
Look at them.
They're still calling.

1262
01:16:52,894 --> 01:16:55,438
Oh man, what a day.
That was a hell of a day.

1263
01:16:55,522 --> 01:16:58,441
Thank you, man.
Man, you're incredible, you know?

1264
01:16:58,525 --> 01:17:01,402
I just see the things you do,
the effect you have on people...

1265
01:17:01,486 --> 01:17:03,863
It's amazing to me.
You got a gift.

1266
01:17:03,905 --> 01:17:07,158
You know? Something people
like me could only dream of.

1267
01:17:07,241 --> 01:17:08,909
I think you could go
all the way.

1268
01:17:08,993 --> 01:17:12,913
Let me be your manager.
Let me guide your career.

1269
01:17:13,038 --> 01:17:18,793
I'm talking stand-up, records, TV, movies...
I want the whole world

1270
01:17:18,877 --> 01:17:20,420
to be a part of P-Town.

1271
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:23,673
Well, I don't think the whole
world is ready for a nigga like me.

1272
01:17:23,756 --> 01:17:25,758
Well I think you're wrong.

1273
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:28,886
I think the world's
been waiting

1274
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,430
for a nigga like you.

1275
01:17:31,472 --> 01:17:32,931
What you say?

1276
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:36,434
(LAUGHING)

1277
01:17:37,268 --> 01:17:38,853

(FUNK MUSIC PLAYING)

1279
01:17:50,364 --> 01:17:53,617
VERNELL: You ladies ever been to vote?
How you doing, young brother?

1280
01:17:53,659 --> 01:17:58,079
Okay, vote for Shirley Chisholm.
Shirley Chisholm for President, 1972.

1281
01:17:58,163 --> 01:18:00,748
Over here, young man.
Is your mom registered? Are you registered?

1282
01:18:01,958 --> 01:18:04,085
Now the judge say,
"Petey Greene,

1283
01:18:04,168 --> 01:18:06,796
"why you rob everybody
in the house?"

1284
01:18:06,879 --> 01:18:09,798
I said, "Well, your honor,
they all seemed like such nice people,

"I didn't want anybody
to feel left out."

1286
01:18:14,594 --> 01:18:17,222
And I'm looking out
amongst y'all,

1287
01:18:17,305 --> 01:18:19,891
and there's some good old robbing
motherfuckers out here tonight.

1288
01:18:19,974 --> 01:18:21,976
Watch your purse, baby.

1289
01:18:23,853 --> 01:18:25,479
DEWEY: Well, I'm looking
at the dates right now.

1290
01:18:25,563 --> 01:18:29,233
I got him at the Howard Theater then the Crystal Room.
He's booked.

1291
01:18:29,316 --> 01:18:31,944
Well, I can get you
a time next month.

1292
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:34,196
Can't wait?

1293
01:18:34,571 --> 01:18:37,032
Y'all see the paper
this morning, P-Town?

1294
01:18:37,073 --> 01:18:41,828
Say "Petey Greene goes to the White
House and steals some silverware."

1295
01:18:41,869 --> 01:18:44,538
Now, come on,
that don't make no damn sense.

1296
01:18:44,622 --> 01:18:47,708
Imagine that,
a negro like me, ex-con,

1297
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:49,918
get invited by the President
to the White House,

1298
01:18:50,002 --> 01:18:51,879
and I'm gonna run up in there
and take something?

I tell it to the hot,
I tell it to the cold.

I tell it to the young,
I tell it to the old.

Don't want no laughing,
don't want no crying.

I know it sounds crazy,
man, but I...

1321
01:20:03,653 --> 01:20:07,615
I kind of miss that little old radio
station back at Lorton, man.

1322
01:20:07,948 --> 01:20:11,827
And I know it wasn't nothing
but a room and a turntable

with about 58 records
in crates, but I...

okay? You're not gonna be...

God damn! Maybe.

Good evening, Washington.

1380

My guest tonight is a pimp that
I wouldn't trust to wash my car,

1381

elected him city official...

1384
01:23:56,283 --> 01:23:57,283
DEWEY: What?

1385
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:00,495
(LAUGHING) Freda!

1386

1387

Where's Petey, huh?
Lay it on me, now! Lay it on me!

1388
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:10,129
Right on with the right-on!

You're not gonna
believe what's happening.

1390
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,132
You're not gonna
believe it, man.

1391

Was it Free Pussy Day
or something?

manager on the planet.

This is it, my man.
Yeah.

This is that moment that
I've been telling you about.

1399
01:24:39,781 --> 01:24:41,699
Yeah. Yeah!

1400

Yeah. Okay.

1403

Okay.

Like they say.

1405

1410
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:53,640
Glad you could make it
on such short notice.

1411
01:25:53,724 --> 01:25:56,726
If you called us twenty seconds ago, sir,
we would have been here.

1412
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:58,728
And you must be Petey.
Hey.

1413
01:25:58,812 --> 01:25:59,896
Heard a lot about you.

Johnny's looking forward
to hearing your routine.

I don't disappoint him.

out of this, man.

Listen to me, Dewey.

And I know you saw that look.

Dewey, baby. I know
how important this is to you.

He does, too! That's the
only reason why he's here!

with me. Bullshit, Vernell.

Bullshit! I mean, Cosby, Gregory, Pryor,
they've all been on that stage.

What comic in the world doesn't
want to be on The Tonight Show?

You see, he ain't a comic.

1460
01:29:28,087 --> 01:29:30,589
He ain't a comic, he ain't
a television personality,

he ain't a civic leader!

He's just a regular-ass
nigga from DC who...

1463
01:29:39,389 --> 01:29:42,308
He's just a regular-ass nigga from
DC who likes to run his mouth.

Vernell, you're wrong, okay?

01:29:49,857 --> 01:29:51,775
Look where we are.

Look where we are.

1468
01:29:53,485 --> 01:29:57,864
He doesn't want to be here, Dewey.
I can see it in his eyes.

1469
01:29:58,656 --> 01:30:02,035
Just keep an eye on him.

1470

Make sure he doesn't leave
that room. Okay?

01:50:21,778 --> 01:50:25,865
DEWEY: Petey liked to say
that he was just a con.

1686
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:28,367
Telling it like it is.

1687
01:50:30,077 --> 01:50:32,120
But he was more than that.

1688
01:50:37,417 --> 01:50:40,295
He said the things
that we were afraid to say.

1689
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:43,881
I'm sorry, man.

1690
01:50:51,597 --> 01:50:54,349
He was the bravest man
that I ever met.

1691
01:50:56,726 --> 01:50:59,437
He was, and still is,
everything I'm not.

1692
01:51:02,815 --> 01:51:04,442
And that's why I love him.

1693
01:51:04,525 --> 01:51:05,985
MAN: Yeah.

1694
01:51:10,114 --> 01:51:12,532
So, in the words
of my best friend,

1695
01:51:15,785 --> 01:51:18,079
"That's all we got.
MAN: Yeah!

1696
01:51:18,163 --> 01:51:19,956
"There ain't no more.
That's right!

1697
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:21,916
"Time is tight.

1698
01:51:21,999 --> 01:51:24,502
"It's the end of the show.

1699
01:51:24,585 --> 01:51:28,464
"So grab your head
and make a fist."

1700
01:51:29,048 --> 01:51:31,758
"Listen to me
and remember this."

1701
01:51:31,842 --> 01:51:33,135
...and remember this.

1702
01:51:33,218 --> 01:51:36,513
I tell it to the hot,
I tell it to the cold.

1703
01:51:36,596 --> 01:51:40,141
I tell it to the young,
I tell it to the old.

1704
01:51:40,224 --> 01:51:43,019
Don't want no laughing,
don't want no crying.

1705
01:51:43,102 --> 01:51:46,063
And most of all, no signifying.
DEWEY: "...no signifying!"

1706
01:51:46,647 --> 01:51:50,526
This is Petey Greene's Washington,
ladies and gentlemen.

1707
01:51:50,567 --> 01:51:52,110
This is P-Town!

1708
01:51:52,194 --> 01:51:55,572
ALL: Petey! Petey!
Petey! Petey!

1709
01:51:55,655 --> 01:51:59,367
Petey! Petey! Petey! Petey!

1710
01:52:05,539 --> 01:52:06,665
PETEY: Be cool, y'all.

1711
01:52:54,668 --> 01:52:56,503
PETEY: Wake up, God damn it!

1712
01:54:16,534 --> 01:54:18,453
VERNELL: Shirley Chisholm
for President, everybody!

1713
01:54:18,536 --> 01:54:20,997
Vote Shirley Chisholm
for President, 1972!

1714
01:56:14,059 --> 01:56:17,103
PETEY: Why do you think
they send our boys off to war?

1715
01:58:27,348 --> 01:58:30,893
Look here. I ain't never
asked for this shit.
