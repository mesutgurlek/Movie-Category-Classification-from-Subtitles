go on believing
we're all fools like you.

1076
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,249
I waited a long time
for you, boy.

1077
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,710
But I got you.

1078

in Camp Campbell, Kentucky.

Now I've got you.

1081

One less fool for the race
to be ashamed of.

C.J. killed himself, sir.

The day after I saw him,
the MPs found him
hanging from the bars.

1087

Peterson was right
on that one. We needed
to protest that man.

1090
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:06,757
And the sergeant,
what did he do?

1091
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,633
Well, they broke up
the team

1092
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:12,637
and they assigned us to this here
smoke-generating company.

1093
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:16,308
And the sarge,
he just started acting funny.

1094
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,935
He stayed drunk
all the time.

1095

What time did you get in
the night he was killed?

1096
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:24,274
Between 2120 and 9:30.

1097
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:27,277
Me and Henson listened
to The Jack Benny show,

1098
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:31,531

Who was the last man in that night?

Nivens.

the area, Jim. We're here
to question these two.

I'm not here to answer

Same night somebody killed him.

1114

Course, I should've
done it myself by the way
he spoke to Wilcox and me.

How did he speak
to you, captain?

1116

Well, he was drunk.
He said a few things
he shouldn't have.

I told the lieutenant not to make
the situation any worse than it was.

Alive.

Exactly what did he say?

1121
01:15:07,879 --> 01:15:11,173
He said he wasn't gonna obey
the white man's orders anymore.

1122
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:14,509
And he starts blaming
Wilcox and me for him being black.

speak to a white officer like that.

Knocked him down.

But we didn't fire.

When did you turn them in?
Right away.

1149
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,082
Nivens took our .45s
to the MPs.

1150
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,291
He wanted it quiet.

1151

Didn't want colored boys

was involved.

cleared ballistics.

what, six months?

It's for MPs

you'd go to Washington,
