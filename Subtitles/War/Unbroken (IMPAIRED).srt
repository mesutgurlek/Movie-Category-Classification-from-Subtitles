1
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,232
We are here.

2
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,939
Cup: (Over radio)
At 8,000 feet.
This is it, boys.

3
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,267
Phil: (Over radio)
You got it, Zamp?

4
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,869
Louie: Roger.

5
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,374
You hit this one,
drinks are on me.

6
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,465
Louie: I ain't going
to a bar with you, handsome.

7
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,585
You confuse all the broads.

8
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,925
- (Chuckles)
- (Wolf-whistles)

9
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,595
Get your cameras, boys.

10
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,435
I'm gonna light it up like Christmas.

11
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,386
(Over radio)
Pilot to bombardier, your ship.

12
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,194
Bombardier to pilot.
Roger.

13
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,936
Bombardier to crew,
bomb bay doors open.

14
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,241
Harry: Bay doors open!

15
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:25,961
Damn flak.

16
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,750
- (Explosion)
- Argh!

17
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,134
Oh, boy!

18
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,729
Come on.

19
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,823
Come on, Zamp.

20
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,955
Louie: There you are.

21
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,489
Louie: Bombs away.

22
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,907
Bombardier to pilot, your ship.

23
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,285
Phil: (Over radio)
Roger.

24
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,714
Okay.

25
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,917
Here we go.

26
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,352
(Chuckling)

27
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,676
Yeah, just like Christmas.

28
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,690
(Mechanical whirring)

29
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,441
Louie: Bomb bay doors are stuck.

30
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,527
Uh-oh.

31
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,219
- Louie: Zero, inbound, 10 o'clock, level.
- Phil: All right.

32
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,372
Cup: (Over radio)
Here they come, boys.
Call them out.

33
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,580
(Rapid gunfire)

34
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,366
(Aircraft approaching)

35
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,376
Phil: (Over radio)
Gotta get those doors closed, zamp.

36
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,550
Louie: Roger.

37
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,378
Get them, get them, get them, Mitchell.

38
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,006
Harry: (Over radio)
Coming in high at nine o'clock.

39
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,052
(Gunfire)

40
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,710
Glassman: Coming level to three.

41
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,768
Clarence: Take 'em out, Mitchell.

42
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,728
(Bullets ricocheting)

43
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,155
(Man shouting indistinctly)

44
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,114
(Men shouting indistinctly)

45
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,910
(Strains)

46
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:31,617
Mac: Low, he's going low.

47
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,422
(Aircraft approaching)

48
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,673
Douglas: Brooks, he's going down.

49
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,264
He's coming to your side.

50
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:46,761
Louie: Glassman!

51
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,137
Glassman!

52
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,873
Okay, okay.

53
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:14,997
(Screaming)

54
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,423
I know, I know. I know.
Let me take a look at you.

55
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,092
I know, buddy, I know.

56
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,471
Just be brave now, all right?

57
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,219
You're still good looking.
You're still very handsome.

58
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,302
- (Groans)
- You make me sick!

59
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:36,484
Yeah!

60
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,861
- (Groans)
- I know.

61
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,818
You got it, buddy.
You got it. I'm right here.

62
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,190
- I want to go home.
- You will, Harry.

63
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,988
You will. All right?
You think about home. Okay?

64
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:50,286
(Men shouting indistinctly)

65
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,670
Oh, boy.

66
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,183
Lambert: Louie?

67
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,718
(Panting)

68
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,353
Louie: Lambert.

69
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:12,428
Here, take this. All right? Take this.

70
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,138
It's okay. Take this.

71
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,229
Louie: Pillsbury?

72
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,128
(Rapid gunfire)

73
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,723
Cup: (Over radio)
Nice work, boys.

74
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,081
Everything's shot
up back there, Phil.

75
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,768
We got no hydraulics but
we're still flying.

76
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,857
We got no flaps, Phil.
So basically we got no brakes.

77
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:06,192
How far to base?

78
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,862
I don't know. Five hours.

79
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,615
If we make it that far.

80
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,569
The runway is over 6,000 feet,

81
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,158
but we're gonna need at least 10
if we got no brakes.

82
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,801
Priest: God created two great lights.

83
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,259
The greater light
to rule over the day,

84
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,510
and the lesser light

85
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:35,517
to rule over the night.

86
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,019
Now these things,

87
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,694
light and dark, day and night,

88
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,067
are separated from each other.

89
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,943
God created each in its place.

90
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:51,532
He did not create a
battle between them.

91
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,455
He said, "I have created
both of these things."

92
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,661
You must live through the night.

93
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,498
Don't battle with it.

94
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,673
(Speaking in Italian)

95
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:08,473
Priest: For God said,
"the night also is mine."

96
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:12,179
He sent his son,
Jesus, not to do battle.

97
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,847
Not to wage war
on the sins of man,

98
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,394
but to forgive them.

99
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,639
Forgive the sin.

100
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,939
Smile on the sinner.

101
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,398
Accept the darkness.

102
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,864
Live through the night.

103
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,236
Love thine enemy.

104
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,368
(Dog barking)

105
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,286
Officer Collier: Zamperini!

106
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,247
Hey!

107
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,503
Boy 1: Is that garlic I smell?

108
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,713
What are you doing, wop?

109
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,345
Boy 1: Hey, why don't you go back to Italy?

110
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,221
You and your greasy wop family.

111
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,842
(Boy 1 chuckles)

112
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,725
- Boy 3: Get him up.
- Boy 1: Get up.

113
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,512
Hey! Hey!

114
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,965
Boy 2: Get off him!

115
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:43,392
(Grunts)

116
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:51,689
Boy 1: Stay down. Dumb dago.

117
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,686
- Boy 1: Hey! Hey!
- Get him off me!

118
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,910
Jesus.

119
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,083
Officer Collier: Hey!

120
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,791
- Boy 2: Shit.
- Boy 1: Go, go, go.

121
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,342
Only reason you're not in reform school now

122
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,221
is because of the respect
we have for your parents.

123
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,468
Everybody in town
wants you put away.

124
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,762
(Doorbell rings)

125
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,982
Sorry, Louise. He was fighting again.

126
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,272
(Speaking in Italian)

127
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,233
And, uh, we found this.

128
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:36,242
He painted the bottle.
It's liquor.

129
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:38,953
(Speaking in Italian)

130
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,617
(Speaking in Italian)

131
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:56,467
(Anthony scolding in Italian)

132
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,930
- (Smacking)
- (Groans)

133
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,777
(Louise praying in Italian)

134
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,945
Woman: What do you think?
He's kinda cute, right?

135
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,947
(Women speaking indistinctly)

136
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,365
Man: Come on, Jimmy, pick it up!
Go, go, go!

137
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:52,505
Girl: Come on, Pete!

138
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,883
Go! Go! Go!

139
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,377
Man: Come on, pass him!

140
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,918
Man: Is someone down there?

141
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,883
Man: Who's down there?

142
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:17,191
(Breathing heavily)

143
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:18,936
Louie: This is so dumb.

144
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,444
Since when were you so smart?

145
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,276
Come on. Faster.

146
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:25,412
Why?
No one's chasing me.

147
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,989
I'm chasing you.

148
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,275
(Panting)

149
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,667
I can't do this, Pete.
I'm not like you.

150
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:40,132
I'm nothing.
Just let me be nothing.

151
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,804
What are you talking about?

152
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,796
I can't make a track team.

153
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,044
- I don't even know why you want me to.
- Yes, you can.

154
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,143
If you can take it, you can make it.

155
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,889
What?

156
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,767
If you can take it, you can make it.

157
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,849
All right.
You train and you fight

158
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,437
way harder than
those other guys.

159
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,154
And you win.
You get out from under them.

160
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,233
Or you keep going
the way you're going

161
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:03,108
and you end up as
a bum in the streets.

162
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:08,825
(Sighs) You can do this, Lou.
Just gotta believe you can.

163
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,658
I don't believe.

164
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,037
(Sighs)

165
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,746
I do.

166
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,750
Come on.

167
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,836
(Commanding in Italian)

168
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,018
(Gunshot fires)

169
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,159
Pete: Come on!

170
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,536
You dumb dago!

171
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,537
(Panting)

172
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,705
(Spectators cheering)

173
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,618
Come on, Louie!

174
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,248
Male radio announcer:
Boy, oh, boy, can that guy fly.

175
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,089
They're calling him
the torrance tornado.

176
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,762
(Cheering and applauding)

177
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,925
(Cheering)

178
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,153
(Bell ringing)

179
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,355
This kid zamperini runs like his
feet never touch the ground.

180
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,236
(All panting)

181
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,082
(Groaning)

182
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,041
(Bell ringing)

183
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,745
Come on!
Keep going!

184
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:18,347
(Cheering in Italian)

185
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,398
Come on, Louie!

186
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,113
Come on, Louie!
Come on, Louie!

187
00:18:30,986 --> 00:18:32,106
Come on, come on, come on!

188
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,662
Male radio announcer:
The torrance tornado smoked the mile

189
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:40,792
in 4 minutes, 21.3 seconds.

190
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,041
Zamperini is now officially the fastest

191
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,963
high school runner
in American history.

192
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,882
Folks, this kid is on his
way to the Olympics!

193
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,383
Why would I come?
You're not going to win.

194
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,340
Sure.
I know that. It's all right.

195
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:57,390
Four years' time, next Olympics,
that's when I show them.

196
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,561
This is just the tryouts for me.

197
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,227
- Tokyo.
- Tokyo.

198
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:09,525
Smart kid.

199
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,897
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

200
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,823
Go have a little fun, too, huh?

201
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,067
Say hi to those pretty
German broads for me.

202
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,275
You know it.

203
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,421
Come here.

204
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,420
Thanks, Pete.

205
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,095
For everything.

206
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,126
(Train whistle blowing)

207
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:40,428
Go on.

208
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:42,768
(Sighs)

209
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,060
(Crowd cheering)

210
00:19:46,395 --> 00:19:47,445
Pete: Louie.

211
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:53,859
A moment of pain is
worth a lifetime of glory.

212
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,775
You remember that.

213
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,354
Gear is down.

214
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,470
All right, here we go.

215
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,941
Still coming in pretty hot. 110.

216
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,776
Almost.

217
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,361
Still too fast.

218
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,162
Come on.

219
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:45,868
(Brakes screeching)

220
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,017
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

221
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,199
(Panting)

222
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,373
Okay.

223
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,134
Flat tire.

224
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:39,635
(Laughs)

225
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,395
(All laughing and
cheering ecstatically)

226
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,310
Gunner: Thank you, God.

227
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,193
Now you're praying?

228
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,687
I was busy before.

229
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,817
My mother does that sometimes.

230
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:46,994
Yeah. A lot of people do this.

231
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,961
He say anything back?

232
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,169
- Yeah.
- What?

233
00:22:57,836 --> 00:22:59,796
He says my bombardier is a dope.

234
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
(Chuckles)

235
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,809
- Really?
- (Laughs)

236
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:12,732
All right, buddy.

237
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,361
Now!

238
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:23,864
(Horn honking)

239
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:33,788
Man: Come on, Louie!

240
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,509
Keep on, buddy.

241
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,762
Keep pushing.

242
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:53,485
- (Horn honking)
- Whoa!

243
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:54,637
Yeah?

244
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:56,936
Huh?

245
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,688
Oh, boy! (Laughs)

246
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,074
4:12. Getting close.

247
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,777
I hope you're not that fast in the sack.

248
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,616
Oh, boy.

249
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,081
(Distant car horn blaring)

250
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,077
- Wrap it up, speedy.
- Huh?

251
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,538
- We got a mission.
- Huh?

252
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,627
Not a combat mission. Rescue.

253
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,956
B-24 en route to
kanton never made it

254
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:27,378
so looks like those boys ditched.

255
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,550
A lot of ocean.

256
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:31,178
Yeah.

257
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,771
And, uh, they got
us some new crew.

258
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,100
We get a new plane?

259
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,273
(Chuckling)

260
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:53,739
This is just like sitting in a living
room trying to fly the house.

261
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,832
They've been taking parts
off this for other planes.

262
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,213
We're lucky it's still got an engine.

263
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,668
Lieutenant says it's airworthy.

264
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,421
It's been certified, he says.

265
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,417
By Helen Keller.

266
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:17,928
Lot of ocean.

267
00:25:19,102 --> 00:25:21,692
Phil: (Over radio) Yeah.
Lot of ocean.

268
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,439
- Mitchell.
- Yeah.

269
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:28,606
You're up.

270
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:42,044
So a duck walks into a bar, right?

271
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:45,302
Or, waddles, if you will.

272
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:47,796
- So, he walks into the bar...
- Uh-huh.

273
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,590
He says to the bartender,

274
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,803
"can I have a crème de menthe?"

275
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:53,094
(Rumbling)

276
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:59,143
Hang on, there.

277
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:00,944
Number one is out.

278
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:02,058
Other engines are
burning more fuel.

279
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,145
Phil: Gotta feather it.

280
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,904
Hey, uh...

281
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:07,823
- (Mouthing) What's his name?
- I don't know.

282
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:08,941
Cup: Engineer?

283
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,106
Can you come up to the cockpit
and feather the engine?

284
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:14,702
- What's going on, guys?
- Co-pilot to radio. Send to base.

285
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:16,793
- Which one?
- Phil: The left.

286
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:17,987
We need more on the right.

287
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:19,156
Cup: That's all we got on the right.

288
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,286
We need more on the right!

289
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,570
That's all we got on the right.

290
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,209
Cup: Damn it!

291
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:27,304
Phil: Left engines are both gone.

292
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:30,047
That's everything on the right, Phil.

293
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:31,215
Okay.

294
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:34,049
(Engine sputtering)

295
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,010
Hey, Phil?

296
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:39,182
Phil: Yeah?

297
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,810
Is this a...

298
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:43,064
Prepare to crash.

299
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:46,195
Mac: Waist gunner!

300
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:47,573
Get the rations box.

301
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:49,945
Cup: Tie the guns down.

302
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:52,074
Who's on the raft?

303
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:53,244
Mac: Glassman!

304
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:55,196
Cup: Send mayday.

305
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,532
Man: Is everyone in position?

306
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:58,585
- Cup: Anyone on the rafts?
- Yeah.

307
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,740
I got it!

308
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,867
Phil: Mayday, mayday, mayday!

309
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:04,075
This isgreen hornet.
We are going down.

310
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,706
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

311
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:06,751
Okay.

312
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,627
Phil: Everybody brace.

313
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:12,475
Brace!

314
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:19,556
(Spectators cheering wildly)

315
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,068
(Slow drumroll playing)

316
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:41,327
(Wild cheering continues)

317
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,560
(Ceremonial song playing)

318
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,124
Olympics radio announcer:
In an astounding performance,

319
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:22,788
negro American
Jesse Owens from Ohio state

320
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:25,998
has won four gold medals
in the 100 meter, the 200 meter

321
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:28,711
the long jump and
the 400 meter relay.

322
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,129
Next up, the 5,000 meter

323
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:34,590
with America's record-breaking
don lash leading the American team.

324
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:37,176
Along with newcomer Louie zamperini.

325
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:38,969
(All cheering excitedly)

326
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:51,981
Fertig!

327
00:28:52,065 --> 00:28:53,065
(Gunshot fires)

328
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:14,245
And already,
three sections of runners have formed

329
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:18,508
with America's don lash and the Finnish
salminen and höckert ahead of the pack.

330
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:21,852
The Finns always the favorite
in this long-haul event.

331
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:28,348
In the second group
is America's Louie zamperini.

332
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,942
The Finns, höckert,
lehtinen and salminen have set the pace

333
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,158
and they are not letting up.

334
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:43,701
And zamperini is fading, too,
dropping further back.

335
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:44,782
(Speaking in Italian)

336
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:04,428
And into the 8th lap

337
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:07,813
it's the Finns still in the lead,
with salminen in first place.

338
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,730
Come on, Louie.

339
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:13,901
Pete: Come on, Louie.

340
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,239
(Bell ringing)

341
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,873
Olympics radio announcer:
And we start the last lap.

342
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:26,578
The Finns seem to be in control.

343
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,580
It doesn't look like don lash is gonna
bring home the medal for the usa.

344
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:38,463
There seems to be
some movement back in the pack.

345
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:43,473
Yes, that's zamperini
overtaking Norway's Rolf Hansen.

346
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:44,927
(Indistinct)

347
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:50,143
He seems to have
some gas in reserve.

348
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:52,185
- He really is making up some time.
- (Laughs)

349
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,653
Höckert and lehtinen
will be one and two.

350
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:00,864
But look at that zamperini!

351
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,204
He's got don lash in his sights.

352
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,042
The great don lash is not gonna be
the first American, folks.

353
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,159
It's high school kid zamperini

354
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,616
pushing past the record-breakers
on this field!

355
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:18,457
I have not seen that!
I have not seen that!

356
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,046
(Spectators cheering wildly)

357
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:27,797
That final lap, folks,
the record for that was 69.2 seconds.

358
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:30,768
Zamperini just did it in 56 seconds.

359
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:34,307
That record is going to hold for a while,
let me tell you.

360
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:14,891
(Gasping)

361
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,033
(Grunting)

362
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:01,483
(Metal creaks)

363
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:16,575
(Air hissing)

364
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:29,878
(Gasping)

365
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:54,656
All right, Phil.
Okay, buddy.

366
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,711
On three.
Two. Three.

367
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,790
(All grunting)

368
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,265
Okay.

369
00:34:40,831 --> 00:34:42,751
All right, here we go.

370
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,970
Glassman didn't make it.

371
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:03,019
Cup didn't make it.

372
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:05,193
Don't think about it, Mac.

373
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:12,026
We're gonna die.

374
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:13,952
No, we're not, Mac.

375
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,699
They don't know where we are.

376
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:20,159
They'll find us.

377
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,208
They'll never see us.

378
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,128
Tell him to shut up.

379
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,046
- Shut up, Mac.
- We're gonna die out here.

380
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,798
Come on, Mac, shut up.

381
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,983
Hey, Mac, chocolate.

382
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,315
One square at night,
one square in the morning.

383
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:54,818
All right?

384
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,368
Mac?

385
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:03,406
Two or three sips a day, yeah?

386
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,254
We gotta make it last.

387
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:15,681
Phil: Zamp?

388
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:18,218
- Zamp?
- Yeah, yeah?

389
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,848
Yeah, Phil?

390
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:26,939
I'm glad it's you.

391
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,569
Yeah, I'm glad it's me, too.

392
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:01,512
(Thudding)

393
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:04,393
Mac: What was that?

394
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:06,849
(Thudding continues)

395
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,055
(Gasps)

396
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:39,468
(Aircraft hovering)

397
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,024
Mac! Mac! Mac, come on!

398
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,890
Get the dye, Mac. Get the dye.

399
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:53,233
- Hey!
- Hey!

400
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:54,524
(Flare gun fires)

401
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:56,612
Hey!

402
00:37:59,196 --> 00:38:00,986
Louie: Hey!
Mac: Hey!

403
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,577
Down here!

404
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:04,779
Hey!

405
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:05,948
Turn around!

406
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,082
Mac: You son of a bitch!

407
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,050
Turn around!

408
00:38:51,582 --> 00:38:52,702
Louie: What did you do, Mac?

409
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:55,877
Huh?

410
00:38:57,629 --> 00:38:59,669
- It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter?

411
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:01,216
It doesn't matter?

412
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,602
It doesn't matter.

413
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:16,315
(Exhales deeply)

414
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:36,498
(Sobbing)

415
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:37,977
(Squawking)

416
00:40:38,063 --> 00:40:39,233
Louie: Jesus!

417
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:42,031
(Screeching)

418
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:44,989
Louie: Get it, Mac! Get it.

419
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:54,954
(Groans)

420
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:57,121
(Louie and Mac groaning)

421
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,049
I don't think I can do it.

422
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:07,428
We gotta try.

423
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,182
(All coughing)

424
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:21,815
We had to try.

425
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,115
You know what?

426
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:29,112
Maybe the fish
won't be so picky.

427
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,049
Phil: Oh, boy.
Louie: Yeah?

428
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:47,719
Phil: I got one. Yeah.

429
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:50,509
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- (Laughing)

430
00:41:50,594 --> 00:41:52,104
Attaboy, Phil!

431
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:54,315
(Phil laughing)

432
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:56,392
Here, here, here.

433
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:58,851
Damn it.

434
00:42:04,066 --> 00:42:05,066
Phil: Okay.

435
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:10,946
Come here, Mac.

436
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:14,285
Come on.

437
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:19,251
Okay.

438
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:22,672
Buon appetito.

439
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:32,218
Mmm.

440
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:34,303
Good?

441
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:40,096
(Moans)

442
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,524
This is how the Japanese eat fish.

443
00:42:43,605 --> 00:42:44,645
Raw.

444
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,650
If you ask me, it's not
food until you cook it.

445
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:50,276
Little lemon,

446
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,531
little garlic...

447
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:55,696
When we get home, come around my house.

448
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:57,494
Mama will cook for ya.

449
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:00,328
You remember that
story inlife magazine

450
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,461
about Eddie rickenbacker?

451
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:07,376
Him and his crew ran out
of fuel over the pacific.

452
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:10,513
They were drifting
in rafts for 24 days.

453
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:13,974
Twenty-four days.

454
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:16,178
They made it, right?

455
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:17,471
Yeah.

456
00:43:18,724 --> 00:43:20,644
Most of them lost their minds.

457
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:23,192
But they made it.

458
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:27,478
We gotta keep talking.

459
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:30,237
Gotta keep our minds sharp.

460
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:34,196
Hey, I'll tell you what
else you're gonna love.

461
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,029
Mama's gnocchi.

462
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:38,738
- Italians.
- Louie: Nobody... (Laughs)

463
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:42,250
Nobody a-make-a gnocchi like her.

464
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:43,461
(Chuckles)

465
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:47,254
Louie: So light.

466
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,421
Like clouds.

467
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,140
First, she makes the dough
out of very fine flour.

468
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:59,467
So fine, it's like talcum powder.

469
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:06,400
Then she uses lots of eggs, like, maybe 12.

470
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:10,148
(Imitating breaking eggs)

471
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:12,938
And then she
beats them up, Mac.

472
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:15,238
(Louie imitates whirring)

473
00:44:16,114 --> 00:44:17,744
Beats them up.

474
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,578
And she drizzles them over.

475
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:25,581
Mmm.

476
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:29,710
(Sighs)

477
00:45:01,618 --> 00:45:04,498
Phil: (Singing) Thou me on

478
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:09,456
the night is dark

479
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:13,882
and I am far from home

480
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:19,837
lead thou me on

481
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:38,364
Louie: Do you think
God made the stars, Phil?

482
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:44,116
Phil: Yes, I do.

483
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:49,213
Louie: So you think there's
some kind of a grand plan?

484
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,457
Why did we live
and the others didn't?

485
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,716
Why are we here now?

486
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:00,934
Phil: Here's the plan.

487
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:05,351
You go on living the best you can.

488
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:10,768
You try to have
some fun along the way.

489
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,861
Then one day it's over.

490
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:19,238
You'll wake up

491
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,830
and there's an angel
sitting at the edge of your bed.

492
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:27,830
Angel says,

493
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:31,457
"okay,

494
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:37,092
"you can ask me
all those dumb questions now

495
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,547
"because I got all the answers."

496
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:46,178
That's what you believe?

497
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:49,645
Yeah.

498
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:52,731
That's what I believe.

499
00:47:14,459 --> 00:47:16,039
(Panting)

500
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:21,381

If you get me through this,
if you answer my prayers

502

not you.

520
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,240
We beat rickenbacker's record

522

Mac.

551

Did you see that surprise Mac attack?

Came down on that thing
like a goddamn dive bomber.

Take a pew.

674
01:15:54,805 --> 01:15:56,685
307, you're in here.

675
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:00,019
You are?

676
01:16:00,602 --> 01:16:01,642
Frank tinker.

677
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:03,438
Tinker, you're up top.

678
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:08,986
I see you met the bird.

679
01:16:15,117 --> 01:16:16,827
Why do you call him "the bird"?

680
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:17,989
Because he listens.

681
01:16:18,078 --> 01:16:22,328
And if he heard the names
we'd like to call him, he'd kill us.

682
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:24,753
Miller: Apparently he grew up wealthy.

683
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:27,005
Wanted to be an officer.
Expected to be, too.

684
01:16:28,172 --> 01:16:29,632
And was denied,

685
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:32,303
which obviously hasn't
gone down too well.

686
01:16:32,342 --> 01:16:36,182
Fitzgerald: Of course,
none of this explains his erratic behavior.

687
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:41,176
Commander Fitzgerald.

688
01:16:41,226 --> 01:16:42,976
Zamperini, sir.

689
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:51,609
They were looking for answers.

690
01:16:51,695 --> 01:16:53,855
Miller: Didn't get any though, did they?

691
01:16:53,906 --> 01:16:55,446
Not one bit.

692
01:16:59,077 --> 01:17:00,367
You should get some shut-eye.

693
01:17:01,371 --> 01:17:02,711
Yes, sir.

694
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,041
(Officer commanding in Japanese)

695
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:37,074
Fitzgerald: Infirmary, turning right!

696
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:38,737
Dismissed!

697
01:17:39,743 --> 01:17:43,203
Officers, turning right!

698
01:17:43,747 --> 01:17:45,247
Dismissed!

699
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:51,917
(Officer keeping count in Japanese)

700
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:54,474
(All keeping count in Japanese)

701
01:18:17,698 --> 01:18:21,368
There is much
talent in omori camp.

702
01:18:24,037 --> 01:18:25,747
We have an opera singer.

703
01:18:27,165 --> 01:18:28,785
Who is the opera singer?

704
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:40,545
We have a chef from Sydney, Australia.

705
01:18:43,015 --> 01:18:46,775
And we have an olympic athlete.

706
01:18:49,813 --> 01:18:52,073
Who is the olympic athlete?

707
01:18:57,154 --> 01:19:00,324
Who is the olympic athlete?

708
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:10,748
(Gun fires)

709
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:12,505
(Cheering in Japanese)

710
01:19:41,073 --> 01:19:42,453
Don't get up.

711
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:17,981
(Panting)

712
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:25,658
You fail.

713
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,120
You are nothing.

714
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:33,212

(Man whistling)

717
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:16,125
Sir?

718
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:22,513
He's tracing so we can return it
before the japs find out.

719
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:24,801
He's got most of
the war mapped out.

720
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,640
(Whispers)
We've invaded the Marshall Islands.

721
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:38,981
The us have invaded
the Marshall Islands.

722
01:21:39,066 --> 01:21:40,976
Allies are gaining ground.

723

(Conversing in Japanese)

724
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:41,917
You know, I gotta say...

725
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:44,634
- Please don't.
- For a bunch of guys who don't eat anything

726
01:22:44,715 --> 01:22:45,885
we sure do shit a lot.

(Both chuckling)

728
01:22:48,552 --> 01:22:49,892
Oh, yeah.

729
01:22:50,512 --> 01:22:52,062

(Whimpering)

738
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:43,424
I'm gonna kill him.

739
01:24:45,002 --> 01:24:46,922
Then they shoot you.

740
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:49,174
I don't give a damn.
Let them shoot me.

741
01:24:51,675 --> 01:24:53,795
That's not how we beat them.

742
01:24:54,469 --> 01:24:57,559
We beat them by making it
to the end of the war alive.

743
01:24:58,682 --> 01:25:00,522
That's how we do it.

744
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:03,192
That's our revenge.

745
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:07,819
If I can take it,
I can make it.

746
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,700
Precisely.

747
01:25:11,737 --> 01:25:13,487
My brother Pete
used to say that.

748
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:16,120
He used to think
that I could do anything.

749
01:25:17,743 --> 01:25:20,043
He used to think that
I was better than I am.

750
01:25:22,122 --> 01:25:23,712

762

They tell your family you died in war.

missing, and not dead

as erroneously announced
by your government.

786
01:29:39,296 --> 01:29:42,916
He is safe and sound with us.

787
01:29:42,966 --> 01:29:45,676
So keep listening, Mrs. zamperini...

788
01:29:45,761 --> 01:29:50,641
And don't mention it.
The pleasure is all ours.

789

Hello, mother and father,
sisters and friends.

790

This is your Louie talking.

791
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:06,657
And the first time in two years
that you will have heard my voice.

792
01:30:09,701 --> 01:30:12,371
I am uninjured
and in good health.

793
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:19,416
I am now interned in
a Tokyo prisoner of war camp

794
01:30:19,503 --> 01:30:23,093
being treated as well as can be
expected under wartime conditions.

795
01:30:24,842 --> 01:30:29,682
I hope Pete is still able to pay you
his weekly visits from San Diego.

796
01:30:32,683 --> 01:30:33,853
Dad...

797
01:30:34,643 --> 01:30:36,063
Keep my guns in good condition

798
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:38,904
so we can go
hunting when I get home.

(Sobbing)

800

Get some good rabbits
for mom's gnocchi sauce.

801
01:30:47,698 --> 01:30:51,578
I wish you all a merry Christmas
and a happy new year.

802

Your loving son, Louie.

(Indistinct chatter)

804
01:31:33,368 --> 01:31:34,698
You were good.

805
01:31:34,745 --> 01:31:36,005
Very good.

806
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:41,214
You can speak on radio again.

807
01:31:55,057 --> 01:31:56,517
I can't say this.

808
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:57,770
Why not?

809
01:31:57,851 --> 01:31:59,691
Because it's not true.

810
01:32:00,771 --> 01:32:03,441
What it says about America,
I can't say that.

811
01:32:05,984 --> 01:32:07,824
They say that.

812
01:32:08,737 --> 01:32:10,697
American like you.

813
01:32:11,365 --> 01:32:12,625
They live here.

814
01:32:13,033 --> 01:32:14,623
Very comfortable.

815
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:15,990
Good food.

817

You want to go back to camp?

818
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:36,261
You make broadcast.

819

(Sighs)

820
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:30,440
You are like me.

821
01:33:31,361 --> 01:33:33,611
We are both strong.

822
01:33:34,865 --> 01:33:38,415
I saw it in your eyes...

823
01:33:38,493 --> 01:33:40,373
The first day.

824
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:42,961
I thought...

825
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,790
This man will be my friend.

826
01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:51,091
But...

827
01:33:51,673 --> 01:33:54,553
Enemy of Japan.

828
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,260
You do not listen.

829
01:33:59,181 --> 01:34:02,391
You do not do
what is asked of you.

830
01:34:10,734 --> 01:34:14,074
It is necessary to have respect.

831
01:34:15,197 --> 01:34:16,527
No respect...

832
01:34:17,407 --> 01:34:19,157
No order.

833
01:34:25,582 --> 01:34:28,842
This man must be taught respect.

834
01:34:29,169 --> 01:34:33,419
All other prisoners will
teach him this lesson.

835
01:34:35,968 --> 01:34:37,968
Each prisoner...

836
01:34:38,595 --> 01:34:42,305
Will punch this man in his face.

837
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:50,440
(Shouting in Japanese)

838
01:34:54,695 --> 01:34:56,115
Sir...

839
01:34:57,698 --> 01:34:59,528
We cannot do that.

844
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:43,581
Do it, sir. Come on.

845
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:46,621

Miller: (As stepsister 2) Cinderella!

878

Ah, cinderella!

879
01:38:53,392 --> 01:38:56,022
- Where is that naughty little maggot?
- (Laughter continues)

880
01:38:56,061 --> 01:38:57,691
Have you seen her, fella?

881
01:38:58,647 --> 01:39:00,357
Ah, there you are,
you lazy little girl.

882
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,150
How am I supposed to get ready for the ball
with you sitting there doing nothing?

883
01:39:04,194 --> 01:39:05,534
Miller: (As stepsister 2)
That's as useful to us

884
01:39:05,612 --> 01:39:07,362
as our morning dance routines.

Tinker: (As stepsister 1) Fix my dress

887
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:17,963
so I can catch the eye
of the dreamy prince hillenbrand.

888
01:39:18,041 --> 01:39:20,631
You couldn't catch the eye of a prince
if it fell in your lap.

889
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:22,881
Come, cinders, fix my hair.

Are you speaking kraut now?

895
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:34,222
Fitzgerald: (As cinderella)
Enough! Enough!

896
01:39:34,266 --> 01:39:37,226
You guys make me do
all these stupid, impossible things

897
01:39:37,269 --> 01:39:39,349
with no food and no rest!

898
01:39:39,396 --> 01:39:41,816
You lock me up
in a rabbit hutch.

899
01:39:41,899 --> 01:39:43,399
I've had enough!

900

That's the good news.

903
01:39:55,204 --> 01:39:56,914
The bad news?

904
01:39:59,917 --> 01:40:02,417
I say goodbye to my friends.

905
01:40:09,635 --> 01:40:12,265
I leave omori tomorrow.

906
01:40:17,601 --> 01:40:21,401
Blackie: (As old lady)
Nothing in this life is hopeless, cinders.

907
01:40:21,438 --> 01:40:24,358
If you keep your
head and your heart

908
01:40:24,441 --> 01:40:27,691
you can do anything!

909
01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:29,198
(Men jeering and hooting)

910
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:30,989
Fear not, dear child...

911
01:40:31,615 --> 01:40:34,285
I am your fairy godmother.

912
01:40:34,451 --> 01:40:36,621
You may congratulate me.

913
01:40:39,414 --> 01:40:40,584
Mmm.

914
01:40:47,214 --> 01:40:49,174
(Men applauding)

915
01:41:17,953 --> 01:41:20,333
And there he goes.

916
01:41:21,498 --> 01:41:23,498
Just like that.

917
01:41:38,182 --> 01:41:39,682
Miller: I have got...

918
01:41:40,517 --> 01:41:41,727
Four kings.

919
01:41:42,186 --> 01:41:43,516
And there you go.

920
01:41:44,688 --> 01:41:46,728
The baron's been beaten, tinker.

921
01:41:46,815 --> 01:41:48,565
- Tinker: Oh, yeah?
- Sugar for us tonight.

922

(Shouting)

929
01:42:43,288 --> 01:42:44,408
Fitzgerald: Got it, Miller?

930
01:42:44,498 --> 01:42:45,668
Miller: Send another bucket!

931
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:56,630
We're helping the japs now?

932
01:42:57,511 --> 01:42:58,931
Might as well let it burn.

933
01:42:59,012 --> 01:43:00,892
Pass it down!

934
01:43:02,182 --> 01:43:03,222
There you go.

935
01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:07,940
(Explosions continue)

936

Tinker: B-29s, boys!

937
01:43:22,119 --> 01:43:23,699
Won't be long now.

938
01:43:24,204 --> 01:43:26,044
I wouldn't get too excited.

939
01:43:26,874 --> 01:43:29,134
If the allies win,

940
01:43:29,209 --> 01:43:31,589
the japs issue kill-all orders.

941
01:43:33,422 --> 01:43:35,472
I overheard them.

942
01:43:37,384 --> 01:43:39,724
We win, we're dead.

943
01:43:42,764 --> 01:43:45,854
Tinker: Well, what are we
supposed to be praying for?

944

(Shrill whistle)

945
01:43:48,103 --> 01:43:49,313
Down! Get down!

(Gasps)

947
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,240
Grab your gear.
They're moving us out.

948
01:44:00,866 --> 01:44:03,116
- To where?
- I don't know.

949
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:04,660
Some new camp.

950
01:44:05,162 --> 01:44:06,832
Tokyo ritz.

951
01:44:06,914 --> 01:44:09,334
Some place the
allies can't find us.

This is naoetsu prison camp.

959
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,260
I am sergeant watanabe,

960
01:48:33,305 --> 01:48:35,435
your commanding officer.

961
01:48:36,808 --> 01:48:41,188
You are enemies of Japan.

962
01:48:42,105 --> 01:48:44,185
You will be treated...

963
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:47,439
Accordingly.

964
01:48:50,197 --> 01:48:52,657
You will help the Japanese

965
01:48:52,741 --> 01:48:55,371
by working on the coal barges.

966
01:48:55,869 --> 01:48:59,409
Anyone who will not work...

967
01:49:00,916 --> 01:49:02,746
Will be executed.

968
01:49:12,344 --> 01:49:14,684
Why don't you
look me in the eye?

969
01:49:21,478 --> 01:49:23,148
Clift: You boys can sleep here.

970
01:49:27,234 --> 01:49:28,744
You two over there.

971
01:49:35,534 --> 01:49:37,334
This is the end, mates.

972
01:49:37,995 --> 01:49:39,415
No one knows you're here.

973
01:49:41,498 --> 01:49:43,668
It's best if you
just resign to your fate.

Watanabe: Lift it.

993
01:55:04,655 --> 01:55:05,785
Lift it!

994
01:55:36,687 --> 01:55:38,017
Over your head.

995
01:56:03,672 --> 01:56:05,012
If he drops it

996
01:56:06,049 --> 01:56:07,089
