you disturb me tonight?

I have urgent news,
my lord.

314
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Our scouts report that the Greeks
have abandoned the whole ofThessaly.

I knew they would.
Sit down and have some wine.

Beyond Thessaly lies
the Oeta range...

with just one narrow pass near the sea,
called Thermopylae.

I'm in no mood
for geography.

But, my lord, we must send
a cavalry column to secure the pass...

before our army
reaches it.

Your duty is to obey me.

I don't want the Greeks
to think I'm afraid of them.

325
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
If they want a fight,
let them come out into the open.

326
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'll leave Thermopylae
as an open door for them to do so.

- And supposing--
- Enough!

Tell me, did you see Demaratus
in the Persian camp?

333
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
No, but I saw a real
Persia-lover there.

334
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
- Who?
- Grellus, father of young Phylon.

335
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I slashed his face
with a whip.

336
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Why, I can't believe it.
He was always a good man.

337

Then he has no business
to be among the barbarians.

338
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm only sorry now I didn't
run him through with a spear.
And Phylon should be questioned.

339
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
He might have known
about his father's actions.

340
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We shall speak to him.

- Ohh.

Hey, this is
a really good war.

348
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
They say Xerxes has brought a hundred
nations with him. Isn't that wonderful?

- When does your aunt expect
King Leonidas back?
- Maybe tonight. Why?

350
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The men gave me
a very good idea.

351
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I can ask Leonidas
for his permission to marry you.

352
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm sure the law is that the king
can act for my father in time of war.

353
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And I could
speak to my aunt.

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Ride back and tell him
we march today.

463
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
The urgent summons
from the council.

464
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The prediction of the oracle
has just arrived from Delphi.

465
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
- Alert my bodyguard.
- Yes.

466
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
''Dwellers
in glorious Sparta...

467
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
''hear now
the words of your fate.

468
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
''Either your famous city goes down
in front of the Persians...

469
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
''or,
if your city is spared...

470
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
the land of Sparta must mourn
for the death of one of her kings.''

471
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You may leave.

472
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
The priestess has spoken.

473
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yes.

474
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And the meaning is clear.

475
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It is either Sparta or a Spartan king.
I accept the challenge.

476
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And, in your opinion,
what must be done?

477
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The army must march at once.
There is no time to lose.

478
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
The council must grant
dispensation to the Spartans
to leave during the festival.

479
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It is not the Spartan way
to neglect the holy festivals.

480
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Nor to neglect Greece.

481
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
The alert order has gone out
to my personal bodyguard...

482
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
who are not subject
to the decisions of the council.

483
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
All the other troops
are waiting in their quarters.

484
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Do not let them
wait long, friends.

485
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Ellas.

486
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Let me look.
Let me look at you.

487
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
How handsome you are.

488
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
The red war cloaks
are so becoming to men.

489
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
This way no enemy
will ever see Spartan blood.

490
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Ellas, we may march tomorrow.
I must go to the king now.

491
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yes. Let us go.
I've spoken to my aunt already.

492
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
My father's gone to the king's house
and is waiting.

493
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Seems that all my life
I've waited for just this day.

494
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
At last you're
going to be my wife.

495
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
- The wife of a real Spartan soldier.
-lust wait till I come back.

496
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'll bring ten Persian slave girls
to wait on you hand and foot.

497
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Oh. Bring just one
and you'll be a dead Spartan.

498
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Now, as soon as the council
proclaims a state of war...

499
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
the whole army will
come under my orders...

500
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
while King Leotychides...

501
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
in accordance with the law,
will remain at home.

502
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Pentheus, son of Sallus,
will be my second in command.

503
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I thank you
for honoring me.

504
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
- May I put forward a personal request?
- Of course, Pentheus.

505
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
My daughter Ellas is waiting outside
with young Phylon.

506
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
He asked permission to speak to you
about a matter concerning...

507
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
both our families.

508
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Let them come in.

509
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
- Speak, Phylon.
- Sir, I've come to ask
your permission to marry Ellas...

510
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
daughter of Pentheus.

511
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Her father's granted his consent,
but my father is away
on family business in Thrace...

512
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and might be
detained by the war.

513
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I beg you to act
in his stead.

514
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
- When did you last
hear from your father?
- Not since he left Sparta, sir.

515
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
He was supposed to return
way before now.

516
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Have you any idea
what might have caused this delay?

517
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
No, sir.
Is there anything wrong?

518
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Agathon believes so.

519
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
While I was being tortured
by the Persians...

520
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
I saw your father
in the enemy camp.

521
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
- No. Not my father.
- He was there with ex-king Demaratus.

522
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
- Why, that's not possible.
- I'm not used to telling lies.

523
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Why, you...
may have been mistaken.

524
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I tell you
I spoke to him!

525
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
He still bears the mark
of my whip on his face.

526
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Sir, I beg you, by the immortal gods,
let me wipe out this disgrace.

527
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Put me in the first line of battle.
Let me die a Spartan.

528
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
As a freeborn man, you are not
responsible for your father's actions...

529
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
yet % cannot ask my soldiers
to accept into their ranks...

530
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
a man whose father is
consorting with the enemy.

531
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
- But, sir--
- That is my final word.

532
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
You will surrender your war cloak
to the officer on duty.

533
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
You may go.

534
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I cannot
find him anywhere.

535
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I'm frightened.
I don't know what to do.

536
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Take hold of yourself.

537
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Sparta gives her women
more freedom than any state.

538
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
In return,
it demands strength.

539
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
How can I be strong?

540
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I love him.

541
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You must be strong.

542
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Remember the Spartan mother
who killed her son when he came home
with a wound in his back.

543
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Why should I remember? Phylon
would never turn his back to the enemy.

544
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
If only they would
let him fight.

545
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I am not a general. I cannot order
the men to take him with them.

546
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
How can you talk like this?
You know Phylon.

547
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
- His mother was your best friend.
- That does not matter.

548
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
- Have you heard?
- Heard what?

549
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
The council has made its decision.
Here it is:

550
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
''People of Sparta,
the army will presently march...

551
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
''in defense of our land
against the Persian king.

552
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
The men are hereby ordered
to depart immediately after
the sacred festival of Carnea.''

553
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
- So you cannot go today.
- I can and I will.

554
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
- And disobey the council?
- My personal bodyguard is not
subject to the council's orders.

555
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
- But that's only 300 men.
- I promised to have
my men at Thermopylae.

556
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
- I didn't say how many.
- But... this is madness.

557
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Less so than to celebrate
a festival and lose the war.

558
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
- Leave us, please, Ellas.
- Yes, Aunt G--

559
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Oh, Ellas.
You know how sorry I am.

560
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I know.

561
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Leonidas...

562
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
why not wait until
the festival is over...

563
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and then lead out the whole army
as a Spartan king should lead it?

564
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
It's only a few days.

565
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,000
No, even today
might be too late.

566
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
- All Greece waits
for the Spartans to march.
- A mere 300 men?

567
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Since when have Spartans started
counting numbers going into battle?

568
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
- I know, but--
- We are but a vanguard.

569
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
The rest will join us
just as soon as the festival is over.

570
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But what if the Persians
attack you before then?

571
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Then we shall
fight alone.

572
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Leonidas...

573
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
my love...

574
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I know your courage.

575
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I am proud of you.

576
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
But there are times
when prudence--

577
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
[ Sighs ]
I don't know what I am saying.

578
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I only know I cannot
live without you.

579
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
You must trust me,
Gorgo.

580
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I love you
more than life itself.

581
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I don't want you to die.

582
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It would be my end too.

583
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Leonidas,
the men are ready.

584
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Agathon, the law
allows me to take 300 men.

585
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Dismiss all those with
no living sons, and replace
them with volunteers who have.

586
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I don't want any Spartan family
to die out.

587
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
- Phylon!
- Ellas.

588
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
- Why are you here?
- Because I love you.

589
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
There is nothing to love now.
I've been rejected by my own people.

590
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I have no honor, no country.

591
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
- No name, no home. I'm an outcast.
- I, too, am an outcast.

592
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I've left my father's house,
and I shall not return
unless you come with me.

593
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Sparta does not want me.

594
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I'm ashamed of you. What if the king
has refused to take you with him?

595
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
You're a free man
and a soldier.

596
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Prove it to him,
and he will take you back.

597
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
How can I prove it?

598
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Surely not by
killing yourself.

599
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Look.

600
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
- My shield.
- Yes. Your shield. You left it behind.

601
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Did you forget the words
my aunt spoke, giving it to you?

602
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Victory or death.

603
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Take this shield.

604
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Follow our soldiers.

605
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Show them that you are
a man and a Spartan.

606
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And I shall be there
watching you.

607
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Look there.

608
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Three hundred men to stand
against the whole of Asia.

609
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
No, 301 .

610
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,000
And all Spartans.

611
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Halt!

612
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
This is the Bay of Locris,
where we're to meet with Themistocles.

613
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Yes.

614
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
In the meantime,
we'll rest here until sundown.

615
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Then we'll march all night.
We must be in Thermopylae by sunrise.

616

Look.

- No.lust to rest.

619
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
- Are you ill, Ellas?
- No. Of course not.

620
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
just tired and...
so cold somehow.

621
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Yes.
You are shivering.

622
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
And you haven't eaten in two days.
I shouldn't have brought you with me.

We have 27 1 ships
lying in the straits.

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
The Persians are
in the bay beyond.

627
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Twelve hundred warships,
with a good number of auxiliary craft.

Yes, but geography
is on our side.

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
In the narrow waters,
we can give them a good fight.

- How many men have you brought?
- Three hundred Spartans.

- Three hundred?
- My personal bodyguard.

633
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Other Spartans will follow
after the festival.

634
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Another festival?

635
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
- We are religious people.
- I know.

636
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Someday I may
enter religion myself.

637
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It's better than politics.

638
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
With the gods behind you,
you can be far more irresponsible.

639
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Themistocles, we invoked
divine help coming here.

640
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
This is no time
for impious remarks.

- Demophalus.

We've heard that
all of Sparta's on the march.

- Your men move like lightning.
- They have an urgent
appointment at Thermopylae.

647
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Yes, we heard
about that too.

648
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Can my warriors
ofThespiae join you?

649
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
There's always room for good men.
How many of you?

650
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
About 7 00--
all volunteers.

651
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I couldn't hold them back
when they heard about Sparta
leading us in this war.

- [ Laughing ]
- Where do we find you?

653
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
We'll be at Thermopylae at daybreak.
The rest of our armies join us there.

654
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Wonderful. But don't start
the killing before we arrive.

655
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
You Spartans go wild
when you smell the enemy.

656
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Leave some for us.
We are Greeks too.

657

''We are Greeks too.''

00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Did you hear
what that man said?

660
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Can this be the beginning of
the miracle we've been waiting for?

661
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Let us pray so.

662
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
You know, Leonidas,
people call me a master politician.

663
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Also a cynic, mountebank
and a charlatan. They're all wrong.

664

%'m nothing but
a sentimental old fool...

with a dream:

666
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
One, free united Greece.

667
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
That is no dream.

668
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I think we should have told
Demophalus that we are only
300 Spartans at this moment.

669
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And ruin all my work?

670

I've sent 20 runners round
with the news that the entire
Spartan army is marching north.

671
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
- But that's not true.
- Truth is a heady wine, friend.

672
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
A politician must never exaggerate
people's capacity for it.

673
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I thank the gods
I am only a soldier.

674
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And I thank them
I'm a politician.

675

Between us, we may make
our dream come true.

to my boats.

Who can understand
the way of gods?

into wives.

Hmm. You are the first strangers
to visit us in years.

It was kind of you
to give us shelter.

We have been herding goats here in the
mountains all our lives, my wife and I.

Yes. They speak little,

that turns up the stomach...

go about naked.

- That's what I heard.

- W-W-When I was young.

I'm going to look
after the goats.

716
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I heard a wolf last night
in the mountains.

717
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,000
- Your son?
- Do you think we'd have
a son like that?

718
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
We don't know
where he came from.

719
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
He just arrived one day,
said he had quarreled with
the people down in the valley.

720
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Maybe a runaway slave,
maybe a thief.

721
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But in the mountains...

722
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
everyone is equal.

723
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Have you heard anything
about the Persians?

Come with me.

- Have they been there long?
- For several days.

727
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And they are still coming.
More campfires every day.

728
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Lucky for us that Thermopylae
is the only way through the mountains.

729
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You mean it's lucky that the Persians
don't know the other way.

730
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
- Is there another way?
- Yes.

731
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
There is an old goat track.
It winds through the mountains...

732
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
and it comes down
beyond the pass.

733
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Nobody uses it now,
but it's still there.

734
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
We must let the Spartans
in the pass know about this.

735
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
- If the Persians found out about it,
our men would be trapped.
- Yes.

736
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
King Xerxes would give much gold
to know about it, wouldn't he?

This is called
the Middle Gate ofThermopylae.

00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,000
It is too narrow
for fighting in open order.

744
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
We will use our special tactics
for close-in fighting.

00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And the rest can learn
from watching the Spartans.

- Shall we keep the men

Yes. Men prefer
to die among their friends.

- I am a goatherd.

I know these
mountains well.

750
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I have come to tell you there is a path
leading through them from the north.

751
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's a bad path,
but the Persians could use it.

752
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
We know there is a path. Our scouts are
looking for it, but they can't find it.

753
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I can show the way. It runs
by the Callidromus Mountain.

We'd better hurry, sir.
The accursed barbarians
are probably looking for it too.

Surely you, at least,
must be the bearer of good tidings.

Artemisia, you are hurt?

1093

No, I'm all right. But your fleet had
no more success today than your army.

1094
01:32:22,251 --> 01:32:26,251
And three of my ships
were sunk.

Even the gods seem to
conspire against me.

My troops in revolt--

like leprosy through the camp.

- Halt these senseless attacks...

into victories demoralizing your men.

This is Hydarnes' fault!

When the Immortals failed,

I must move the fleet, but the ships
can still take you out of this.

No. We shall stay here.

1234

What about
your wounded?

1235
01:43:34,251 --> 01:43:38,251
Spartan wounded go home
only with victory.

1236
01:43:38,251 --> 01:43:42,251
In defeat,
they die with the rest.

1237
01:43:43,251 --> 01:43:47,251
I would share this day
with you, Leonidas...

1238
01:43:46,251 --> 01:43:50,251
but I must be
with the fleet...

1239
01:43:48,251 --> 01:43:52,251
when it fights again
at Salamis.

1240
01:43:54,251 --> 01:43:58,251
I know you don't put much trust
in omens, Themistocles...

1241
01:43:58,251 --> 01:44:02,251
but last night Megistias
received a most wondrous vision.

1242
01:44:03,251 --> 01:44:07,251
Megistias,
tell him your vision.

1243
01:44:08,251 --> 01:44:12,251
I saw ships burning
between two shores--

1244
01:44:10,251 --> 01:44:14,251
many of them,
with Persian markings on their sails.

1245
01:44:15,251 --> 01:44:19,251
There was Xerxes sitting upon a marble
throne, his face wrapped in gloom...

1246
01:44:18,251 --> 01:44:22,251
listening to the cries
of burning men.

1247
01:44:21,251 --> 01:44:25,251
And behind him,
the goddess Athena, all in white...

1248
01:44:25,251 --> 01:44:29,251
a golden spear
in her hand.

1249
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:32,251
She was smiling.

1250
01:44:33,251 --> 01:44:37,251
Tell him all.

1251
01:44:36,251 --> 01:44:40,251
And a voice was saying...

1252
01:44:39,251 --> 01:44:43,251
''Divine Salamis...

1253
01:44:41,251 --> 01:44:45,251
''you will bring death
to the enemies of Greece.

1254
01:44:44,251 --> 01:44:48,251
When the seeds are sown,
all their harvests are gathered in.''

1255
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:53,251
Thank you, old man.

1256
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:55,251
They're advancing, sir. King Xerxes
is leading them in his chariot.

1257
01:44:55,251 --> 01:44:59,251
I'll be right there.

1258
01:45:07,251 --> 01:45:11,251
We shall be watching you fight
at Salamis--

We shall not
fail you, friend.

Sir, Hydarnes is attacking
the Thespians in our rear.

We are cut off.

- All retreated safely.

1264
