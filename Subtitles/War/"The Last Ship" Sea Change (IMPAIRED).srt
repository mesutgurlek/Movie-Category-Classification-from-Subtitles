a free pass for everything else,

that most of the decisions

have been disastrous.

The more pressing issue
is our domestic policy.

436
00:25:09,323 --> 00:25:12,892
I think we can all agree
that Michener jumped too quickly

437
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:14,350
to federalize everything.

438
00:25:14,784 --> 00:25:16,729
If you were to curb
some of his measures,

439
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:19,557
I'm sure it would go a long way
to smoothing things over

440
00:25:19,582 --> 00:25:22,526
with Senator BEATTY
and the American people.

441
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:27,433
The ration-card program has been
the chief cause of unrest,

442
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:29,768
and the limits to bank withdrawals...

443
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,572
The people do not want the government

444
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,713

how they spend their money.

446

The land-claim issues
are just as contentious.

447
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:38,768
What do you all want?

448
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:41,658
To go back
to dog-eat-dog?

449
00:25:42,238 --> 00:25:44,639
That's appealing when
you're at the top of the heap,

450
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:47,143
but there are people out there
going hungry

451
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:49,424
while we are producing more than
enough food to feed everyone.

452
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:52,549
That's why President Michener
started those ration cards,

453
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:55,541
so that all of our citizens
can have their fair share

454
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:56,682

we'll ask for it.

Sir, I know that you were skittish

459
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,846
about instituting these policies
from the beginning.

460
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:18,869
Oliver: It doesn't matter
what I thought then

461
00:26:18,894 --> 00:26:20,658
or if they're unpopular.

462
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:24,260
Are they working or not?

463
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:31,807
I think it's fair to say
that these policies

464
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:34,479
are doing more harm than good, sir.

465
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:40,526
What happened in there?

466
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:42,099
Everything we worked for,

467
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:44,097
everything
President Michener stood for.

468
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:45,448
We're in a crisis.

469
00:26:45,448 --> 00:26:47,432
It's our job
to hold the country together.

470
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:51,229
You sat with the President
and wrote those policies.

471
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,783
You didn't fight for them.

472
00:26:52,808 --> 00:26:54,679
If President Michener
couldn't make them work,

473
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:56,416
then Howard Oliver certainly can't.

474
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,690
So you're gonna let Oliver

475
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:01,619
capitulate to the regional leaders.

476
00:27:03,306 --> 00:27:05,760
He just gave them authority
over local militias

477
00:27:05,785 --> 00:27:07,369
without speaking to Captain Chandler.

478
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:08,986
Chandler's the acting head
of our military,

479
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:10,190
and he never would have allowed it.

480
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:13,116
Captain Chandler is 12,000 miles away.

481
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,401
The regional leaders need to
be able to call their own shots.

482
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,526
If they can't control
their own regions, who will?

483
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:20,166
They're the ones stoking the unrest.
President Michener...

484
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:21,791
President Michener isn't here!

485
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:24,322
He took the easy way out!

486
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:25,987
So if they sit in that office

487
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,697
and they reverse every decision
that he made as President,

488
00:27:28,722 --> 00:27:30,627
there's nobody to blame but him.

489
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:37,189
Sir.

Uh, thank you for coming down.

491
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:42,314
I've made some progress, sir,

492
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:45,213
but I-I still have
more questions than answers.

493
00:27:45,268 --> 00:27:49,737
Um, this is an image of our cure
from Dr. Scott's notes.

494
00:27:49,812 --> 00:27:52,862
I've isolated the compound
in Takehaya and Kyoko's blood.

495
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:54,425
It's exactly the same as ours.

496
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,916
Structurally uncompromised,
as far as I can tell.

497
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:01,151
This is an image of the red flu
from Dr. Scott's files,

498
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:02,573
and this...

499
00:28:03,086 --> 00:28:05,651
This is the virus in Kyoko's blood.

500
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:07,958
It's different.

501
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:09,971
- Chandler: Bulkier.
- Exactly.

502
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:12,864
That bulkiness is present
in Takehaya's virus, as well.

503
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:16,641
The virus in their blood is
similar enough to the original

504
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,619
that my preliminary tests
identified it,

505
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,349
- but it is somewhat altered.
- A mutation.

506
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,721
I can't say for sure,

507
00:28:22,746 --> 00:28:24,822
but whatever's causing the bulkiness

508
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:26,713
is preventing the cure from working.

509
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,027
That means everyone on this ship

510
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:30,121
who's come in contact
with Takehaya could be infected.

511
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:31,324
That was my worry, too,

512
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:33,826
but none of us from the
prison camp have any symptoms.

513
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,010
I crossed the virus in Takehaya's blood

514
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:38,221
with a sample of my own

515
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:40,151
and from several sailors
who had no contact

516
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,885
with Takehaya, Kyoko,
or any of us who were prisoners.

517
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,596
The bulkier virus doesn't make us sick.

518
00:28:46,107 --> 00:28:49,175
Somehow, the cure in us
defends against it.

519
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:52,878
If Takehaya and Kyoko
both have the same cure,

520
00:28:53,622 --> 00:28:55,252
why is the virus harming them?

00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:46,463
Hey, what are you doing, yo?!

648
00:35:46,488 --> 00:35:47,885
You know what my suppliers
will do to me

649
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,509
if even one of those is missing?

650
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,343
Shut up.

651
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:09,143
Holy shit!

652
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:11,456
Sasha: The missile's
clearly been retrofitted

653
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:12,747
since its manufacture.

654
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,956
Has to be a chemical weapon
of some kind.

655
00:36:14,981 --> 00:36:18,179
He picked up those crates
100 miles southeast of Hainan.

656
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:19,470
Paraiso Island.

657
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:21,502
You sure that trafficker
didn't know what was in them?

658
00:36:21,873 --> 00:36:24,768
He was perfectly happy being
a run-of-the-mill drug runner.

659
00:36:24,793 --> 00:36:27,094
Nearly wet himself when we found this.

660
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:33,034
Those bomblets were designed
in the '60s to carry Sarin.

661
00:36:33,522 --> 00:36:35,022
What do you think the range is
on that missile?

662
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:38,237
Depending on the weight
of those bomblets, my guess,

663
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:41,096
it could release high enough
to blanket a 20-mile radius.

664
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:42,698
You wanted to see me?

665
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:47,190
Back in Hong Kong, you mentioned
seeing some missiles.

666
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:49,242
Yellow, with red tips.

667
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,307
These are the same ones
Peng was moving in Guanzhou.

668
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:56,737
The day my brother was killed.

669
00:37:03,058 --> 00:37:05,091
Green mist.

670
00:37:06,503 --> 00:37:07,784
Kyoko, in her fever...

671
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,667
She was murmuring about a green
mist that came in the night.

672
00:38:35,268 --> 00:38:36,651
[Door closes]

673
00:38:36,676 --> 00:38:38,476
The active ingredient
in the green powder

674
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:40,401
is a specially designed Lectin.

675
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:43,448
It's binding to the glycoproteins
of the red flu.

676
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,573
That's why the virus looks bulkier.

677
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,302
It hasn't mutated.

678
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:49,784
The Lectin can create a coating
that shields the virus

679
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:52,440
from the effects of the antibody
that our cure produces.

680
00:38:52,465 --> 00:38:54,667
I couldn't see it because
I didn't know what I was looking for.

681
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:57,087
- But if somebody already has the cure?
- Then they're safe.

682
00:38:57,112 --> 00:38:58,845
You'd have to have the Lectin
in your bloodstream first

683
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,313
to render the cure...

684
00:39:01,705 --> 00:39:03,012
ineffective.

685
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,749
Slattery: That's what Peng's hoarding.

686
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:07,754
He could fire those missiles
over uncured populations,

687
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,588
so when the cure finally does arrive...

688
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:11,645
It doesn't work.

689
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:14,427
That boat was headed to Taiwan
on a run.

690
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:17,065
Jesse saw the missiles near Vietnam.

691
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,268
And my wife saw the mist in Japan.

692
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:24,854
By the time we got to the ports
to receive the cure,

693
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:26,768
it was already too late.

694
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,510
That's right.

695
00:39:34,979 --> 00:39:37,096
I would like to see my wife...

696
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:39,955
my son.

697
00:40:04,726 --> 00:40:06,960
[Indistinct conversation]

698
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:08,323
Good evening, Mr. President.

699
00:40:08,348 --> 00:40:09,971
Commander Green.

700
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:16,799
The President would like
to keep these briefings

701
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:19,206
to senior advisors for the time being.

702
00:40:20,511 --> 00:40:22,362
We'll summon you if we need you.

703
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:35,149
Slattery: We were welcomed
as heroes in Vietnam.

704
00:40:35,444 --> 00:40:37,854
Everyone came out of hiding
to get the cure.

705
00:40:40,352 --> 00:40:42,337
If they were exposed to this...

706
00:40:42,362 --> 00:40:45,370
They spread out across the country
to pass on the contagious cure,

707
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:48,143
and if they were exposed
to the red flu...

708
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,565
spread that instead.

709
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,292
That was 10 days ago.

710
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:57,963
And we don't know how many
of these missiles there are.

711
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:03,215
So... now we know
what Peng's plan is.

712
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,721
It's genocide.

713
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,681
