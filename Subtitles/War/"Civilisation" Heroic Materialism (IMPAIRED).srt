(MUSIC) WILLIAM WALTON:
Symphony In B Flat Minor

2
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,538
Dorothy Wordsworth said about the view
of London from Westminster Bridge,

3
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:34,408
that "It was like one of Nature's
own grand spectacles."

4
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,468
Well, nature is violent and brutal

5
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,990
and there's nothing we can do about it.

6
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,229
But New York?
After all, New York was made by men.

7
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,979
It took almost the same time
to reach its present condition

8
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,508
as it did to complete the Gothic cathedrals.

9
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,060
At which point, a very obvious, reflection
crosses one's mind

10
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,090
that the cathedrals were built to the glory of God,
New York was built to the glory of mammon,

11
00:02:58,188 --> 00:02:59,938
money, gain,

12
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,979
the new god of the 19th century.

13
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,949
So many of the same human ingredients
have gone into its construction

14
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,500
that, at a distance
it does look rather like a celestial city.

15
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,538
At a distance.

16
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:13,979
Come closer and it's not so good.

17
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,348
(MUSIC) WILLIAM WALTON:
Symphony In B Flat Minor

18
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,830
Behind this grim uniformity
lurks an even grimmer poverty

19
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,258
and problems that seem almost insoluble.

20
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,538
One sees why heroic materialism
is still linked with an uneasy conscience.

21
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:39,580
It has been from the start.

22
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,628
I mean, that, historically,

23
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:47,460
the first discovery and exploitation of those
technical means which made New York possible

24
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,310
coincided exactly with the first
organised attempt to improve the human lot.

25
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,919
The first large iron foundries in England,

26
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,750
like the Carron Works or Coalbrookdale

27
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,110
date from round about 1780.

28
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,538
Howard's book on penal reform
was published in 1777

29
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:12,500
and Clarkson's Essay On Slavery in 1786.

30
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,259
Clarkson laid the foundations
of the antislavery movement

31
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,139
and painstakingly discovered
all the horrifying evidence.

32
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,149
The political side was the life, work
of William Wilberforce

33
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,699
in whose house in Hull I'm now standing.

34
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,139
I've often heard it said
by people who want to seem clever,

35
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,509
that "Civilisation can exist only
on a basis of slavery"

36
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,550
and, in support of their thesis,

37
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:43,300
they point to the examples of 5th-century
Greece, or of the antique world in general.

38
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,660
If one defines civilisation
in terms of leisure and superfluity,

39
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,980
there is a grain of truth in this repulsive doctrine,

40
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:53,500
but I have tried throughout this series

41
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,550
to define civilisation in terms of creative power
and the enlargement of human faculties,

42
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:03,379
and from that point of view,
slavery is abominable.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,560
Well, so, for that matter, is abject poverty.

44
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:09,660
Poverty, hunger, plagues, disease,

45
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,819
they were the background of history
right up to the end of the 19th century,

46
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,389
and most people regarded them as inevitable,
like bad weather.

47
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,379
Nobody thought they could be cured.

48
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,709
All that was required
was an occasional act of charity.

49
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,620
This pretty scene is entitled Rustic Charity

50
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,670
and under it are written the lines

51
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,019
"Here, poor boy without a coat,
take this ha'penny."

52
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:37,420
Not an indication of very serious concern.

53
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,069
But slaves and the trade in slaves
that was something different.

54
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,910
It was esoteric.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,430
It wasn't something that surrounded one
like the air, as homemade poverty did,

56
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:52,459
and the horrors it involved
were far more horrible.

57
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,910
Even the unsqueamish stomachs
of the 18th century

58
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,430
were turned by accounts
of "the middle passage".

59
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,189
(Creaking timbers)

60
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,100
This is one of the irons
used for branding the slaves

61
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:35,139
on chest and back with the proprietor's initials.

62
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:44,139
This is the actual model of a slave ship,

63
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,778
which Wilberforce produced
in the House of Commons

64
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,329
to show how the slaves were crammed together.

65
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,790
It's reckoned that over nine million slaves

66
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,939
died from heat and suffocation
in those holds on the way to America.

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,790
A remarkable figure, even by modern standards.

68
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:10,139
The antislavery movement

69
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,990
became the first communal expression
of the awakened conscience

70
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:16,019
but it took a long time to succeed.

71
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,028
The trade was prohibited in 1807

72
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,629
and, as Wilberforce lay dying in 1835,

73
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,550
slavery itself was abolished.

74
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:30,778
Well, one must regard this
as a step forward for the human race,

75
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,139
and be proud, I think,
that it happened in England.

76
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,990
But not too proud.

77
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,110
The Victorians were very smug about it

78
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:41,139
and they chose to avert their eyes

79
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,990
from something almost equally horrible
that was happening to their own countrymen.

80
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,060
England had entered the war against Napoleon

81
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,028
in the first triumphant consciousness
of its new industrial powers.

82
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,680
After 20 years, England was victorious,

83
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,899
but, by failing to control
her industrial development,

84
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,910
she'd suffered a defeat, in terms of human life

85
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,709
far more costly than any military disaster.

86
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,050
I needn't remind you of how cruelly

87
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,949
the Industrial Revolution degraded and exploited
a mass of people for 60 or70 years.

88
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,750
After about 1790

89
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:26,060
there appeared the large foundries and mills,

90
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,430
which dehumanised life.

91
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,660
Arkwright's spinning frame,
invented in about 1770

92
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,220
is always quoted as the beginning
of mass production. On the whole, rightly.

93
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,428
There he is, faithfully recorded for us
by Wright of Derby,

94
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:45,528
typical of the new man who was to dominate
industry until the present day.

95
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,139
He and his like gave England a flying start
in the economy of the 19th century,

96
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,110
but the result of their inventions
was a dehumanisation

97
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,710
that obsessed almost every great
imaginative writer of the time.

98
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:08,418
From the start, poets had recognised
the nature of the "satanic" mills.

99
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,428
Robert Burns
passing the Carron Iron Works in 1787,

100
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:16,460
scratched these lines on a windowpane.

101
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:19,460
"We cam na here to view your works,

102
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:21,500
In hopes to be mair wise,

103
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,548
But only, lest we gang to hell,

104
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,580
It may be nae surprise."

105
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:37,139
This new religion of gain
had behind it a body of doctrine,

106
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,710
without which it could never have maintained
its authority over the serious-minded Victorians.

107
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:44,740
Its sacred books

108
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,110
the works of Malthus on population

109
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,149
and Ricardo on economics

110
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,190
were taken as gospels by pious men,

111
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:54,538
who used them to justify actions

112
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:58,298
they would never have thought of defending
on human grounds.

113
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:01,298
Hypocrisy?

114
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:03,950
Well, hypocrisy has always existed.

115
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:08,580
Where would the great comic writers have been
without it, from Moliere downwards?

116
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:10,418
But in the 19th century,

117
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:14,860
with its insecure middle class
dependent on an inhuman economic system,

118
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,110
there was mass hypocrisy
on an unprecedented scale.

119
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,149
For the last 40 years or so,

120
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,308
the word "hypocrisy" has been a sort of label
attached to the 19th century,

121
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,940
just as "frivolity" was attached to the 18th century
and with about as much reason.

122
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,950
The reaction against it continues.

123
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:34,860
Although it is a good thing
to have cleared the air

124
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,230
I think that the reaction has done harm

125
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,590
by bringing into discredit all professions of virtue.

126
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:48,220
The very words "pious", "respectable", "worthy"
have become joke words, used only ironically.

127
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,908
Much as one hates the inhuman way
in which the doctrines of Malthus were accepted,

128
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,950
the terrible truth is

129
00:10:57,028 --> 00:11:00,500
that the rise of population did nearly ruin us.

130
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,538
It struck a blow at civilisation more ominous
than anything since the barbarian invasions.

131
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:08,009
First, it produced the horrors of urban poverty

132
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,190
and then the dismal countermeasures
of bureaucracy and regimentation.

133
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,058
It must have seemed, may still seem, insoluble.

134
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,220
Yet this doesn't excuse the callousness

135
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,269
with which prosperous people
ignored the conditions of life among the poor

136
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,308
on which, to a large extent,
their prosperity depended.

137
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,899
And this in spite of the most detailed
and eloquent descriptions

138
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,950
that were available to them.

139
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:34,860
I need mention only two:

140
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,990
Engels's Conditions Of The Working Class,
written in 1844

141
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,639
and the novels written by Dickens

142
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,950
between 1838 and 1854

143
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:47,100
between Nicholas Nickleby and Hard Times.

144
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,580
Engels's book is presented as documentation,

145
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:55,980
but it is, in fact
the passionate cry of a young' social worker

146
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,350
and, as such, it provided
and has continued to provide,

147
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,389
the emotional dynamo of Marxism.

148
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,389
Marx read Engels.

149
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,908
I don't know who else did. That was enough.

150
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,950
But everybody read Dickens.

151
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:14,340
The pictures you're looking at
are by the French artist Gustave Doré,

152
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,950
whose illustrated books on London
appeared in 1872.

153
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,460
You see, things hadn't changed much
since the '40s.

154
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,658
Perhaps it took an outsider
to see London as it really was,

155
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,940
and it needed someone
of Doré's marvellous graphic skill

156
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:32,700
to make this great slice
of human misery credible.

157
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,340
I think that Dickens did more than anyone
to diffuse an awakened conscience

158
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,308
but one mustn't forget the practical reformers
who preceded him.

159
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:56,820
At the beginning of the period,
the Quaker, Elizabeth Fry,

160
00:12:56,908 --> 00:13:00,418
who, in an earlier age,
would certainly have been canonised,

161
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:05,058
because her spiritual influence on the prisoners
of Newgate was really a miracle.

162
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,070
And in the middle of the century,
Lord Shaftesbury,

163
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:15,379
whose long struggle to prevent the exploitation
of children in factories

164
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,389
puts him next to Wilberforce,
in the history of humanitarianism.

165
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,428
It's an almost incredible fact

166
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:28,139
that, in the middle of the 19th century,
there was no children's hospital in London

167
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,308
and children weren't taken into ordinary
hospitals for fear that they might be infectious.

168
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,230
Shaftesbury was one of the founders
of the Hospital For Sick Children.

169
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,750
Dickens helped to raise the money for it.

170
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,379
There is its first ward in Great Ormond Street.

171
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,389
Here is its successor today.

172
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,590
And, as I look at it

173
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:55,370
I'm more than ever convinced
that humanitarianism

174
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,428
was the great achievement of the 19th century.

175
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,428
We're so much accustomed
to the humanitarian outlook

176
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:09,980
that we forget how little it counted
in earlier ages of civilisation.

177
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,389
Ask any decent person
in England or America today

178
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,389
what he think matters most in human conduct

179
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,350
five to one, his answer will be "kindness".

180
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:25,330
It's not a word that would have crossed the lips
of any of the earlier heroes of this series.

181
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,908
If you'd asked St Francis what mattered in life,
he would, we know, have answered

182
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,350
"Chastity, obedience and poverty."

183
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,389
If you'd asked Dante or Michelangelo,
they might have answered,

184
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,070
"Disdain of baseness and injustice."

185
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:41,298
But kindness? Never.

186
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,190
Nowadays, I think we underestimate the
humanitarian achievement of the 19th century.

187
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:51,620
We forget the horrors that were taken
for granted in early Victorian England.

188
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,870
The hundreds of lashes

189
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,990
inflicted daily on perfectly harmless men
in the Army and Navy.

190
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,149
The women chained together in threes,

191
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,509
rumbling through the streets in open carts,
on their way to transportation.

192
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,750
These and other
even more unspeakable cruelties

193
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,269
were carried out by agents of the establishment,
usually in defence of property.

194
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,350
Some philosophers tell us that humanitarianism

195
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,389
is "a weak, sloppy,

196
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,629
self-indulgent condition,

197
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,259
spiritually much inferior to cruelty and violence".

198
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,190
This point has been eagerly accepted
by novelists,

199
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:32,500
dramatists and theatrical producers.

200
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:38,490
Of course, it's true that kindness is
to some extent, the offspring of materialism

201
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,629
and this has made antimaterialists
look at it with contempt,

202
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,269
at the product of what the German philosopher
Nietzsche called "a slave morality".

203
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,110
He would certainly have preferred
the other aspect of my subject,

204
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,470
the heroic self-confidence of the men
for whom nothing was impossible,

205
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:59,700
the men who forced
the first railways over England.

206
00:15:59,788 --> 00:16:01,058

(MUSIC) JOHANN STRAUSS:
Tales From The Vienna Woods, "Bahn Frei"

208
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:25,658
The railway engine created a situation
that was really new,

209
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,418
a new basis of unity,
a new concept of space,

210
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:30,580
a situation that is still developing.

211
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:11,420
The 20 years after Stephenson's Rocket
had made its momentous journey

212
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:13,740
along the Manchester-Liverpool railway

213
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:15,858
were like a great military campaign.

214
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,868
The will, the courage, the ruthlessness,

215
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,910
the unexpected defeats,

216
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,950
the unforeseen victories.

217
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:28,858
The Irish navvies who had built the railway
were like a "grande armée",

218
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,028
ruffians, who yet had a kind of pride
in their achievement.

219
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:35,058
(MUSIC) Tales From The Vienna Woods

220
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,750
Their marshals were the engineers.

221
00:17:57,548 --> 00:18:04,140
The strongest creative impulse of the time
didn't go into architecture, but into engineering,

222
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,190
partly because, at this date,

223
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:10,338
it was only in engineering
that men could make full use of the new material

224
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,470
that was going to transform
the art of building - iron.

225
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:21,259
The first iron bridge in the world was built
at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire in 1779.

226
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,430
Almost archaic.

227
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:30,769
By 1820, Telford could build the Menai Bridge,
the first great suspension bridge,

228
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,230
an idea that combines beauty
and function so perfectly

229
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:39,778
that it's hardly been varied, only expanded,
down to the present day.

230
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,430
Here's the Clifton Bridge, begun in 1836,
although not completed till long after,

231
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:49,048
still one of the most beautiful
suspension bridges in the world.

232
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,990
It was designed by a man who deserves to, rank
with the earlier heroes in this series

233
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:00,019
Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

234
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,298
He was a born romantic.

235
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,868
Although the son of a distinguished engineer,

236
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,548
brought up in a business
that depended on sound calculations,

237
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,828
he remained, all his life
in love with the impossible.

238
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,910
In fact, as a boy, he fell heir to a project
which he himself believed to be impossible,

239
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,910
his father's plan for the construction
of a tunnel under the Thames.

240
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,470
At 20, his father put him in charge of the work

241
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:34,220
and thus began the sequence of triumphs and
disasters that were to mark his whole career.

242
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:37,220
Here's one of the triumphs.

243
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:40,740
A grand dinner held in the tunnel
when it was halfway across.

244
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:43,858
On the left, Father Brunel congratulating his son.

245
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,230
Behind them, a table full of notables.

246
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,220
It's typical of Brunel
that, in the next bay of the tunnel,

247
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:53,180
there was an equally grand dinner
for 150 of his miners.

248
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,990
Two months later, the shield collapsed
and the water poured in for the third time.

249
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:02,019
In the end, the tunnel was completed.

250
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,220
That was the way with Brunel's designs.

251
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:07,700
They were so bold that shareholders
were frightened and withdrew,

252
00:20:07,788 --> 00:20:09,858
sometimes, I'm bound to say, with reason.

253
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,108
But one thing he did push through and complete
and that was the Great Western Railway.

254
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,630
Every bridge, every tunnel was a drama,

255
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,910
demanding incredible feats of imagination,
energy and persuasion

256
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,430
and producing works of great splendour.

257
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:27,140
The greatest drama of all was the Box Tunnel,

258
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,348
two miles long, on a gradient,
half of it through rock,

259
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,548
which Brunel, against all advice,
left unprotected.

260
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,588
How on earth did they do it?

261
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,990
By men with pickaxes, working by torch light,

262
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:41,298
and horses to pull away the debris.

263
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,348
There were floods, collapses.

264
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,670
It cost the lives of over 100 men.

265
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,470
But, in 1841

266
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,500
a train steamed through

267
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:53,538
and from that day forward, for over a century,

268
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,150
every small boy dreamt of becoming
an engine driver.

269
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,750
Brunel, by his dreams,

270
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:07,778
no less than by his practical application
of engineering techniques,

271
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,828
is the ancestor of New York.

272
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,868
And, I must say, he looks it.

273
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,910
There he is, complete with cigar,

274
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,588
the first hero in this series
of whom we have a photograph.

275
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,150
He's standing in front of the chains
used in launching,

276
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,190
or rather in failing to launch,

277
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:26,019
his vast steamship, the Great Eastern.

278
00:21:27,068 --> 00:21:29,019
This was his most grandiose dream.

279
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,828
The first steamship to cross the Atlantic in 1838
had been only 700 tons.

280
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,108
Brunel's Great Eastern was to be 24,000 tons

281
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,150
a floating palace.

282
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,950
The amazing thing is that he got it built at all,

283
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:48,298
but, no doubt
he had taken too big a leap forward.

284
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,950
Although the Great Eastern ultimately floated
and crossed the Atlantic

285
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:56,940
the delays and disasters it had involved
killed its designer.

286
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,390
But the transatlantic liner was one more way

287
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,548
in which the 19th century
created its new world of shape,

288
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,588
its architecture.

289
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:13,058
"The shapes arise",

290
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,720
said Walt Whitman, writing in the 1860s,

291
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:20,140
"Shapes of factories, arsenals,
foundries, markets;

292
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,750
Shapes of the two-threaded tracks of railroads;

293
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:26,288
Shapes of the sleepers of bridges,

294
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,548
vast frameworks, girders, arches."

295
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,940
This is our own style,
which expresses our own age,

296
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:37,700
as the baroque expressed the 17th century,

297
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:40,858
and it's the result of 100 years of engineering.

298
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,670
It's a new creation, but it's related to the past

299
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,420
by one of the chief continuous traditions
of the Western mind

300
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:50,460
the tradition of mathematics.

301
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:59,460
In the middle of the 19th century, it might well
have looked as if art that set out to be artistic

302
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:01,500
had much better all be scrapped.

303
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,618
Think of the Great Exhibition of 1851.

304
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,548
It was contained in a building,
the so-called Crystal Palace,

305
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,108
but was a piece of pure engineering
on Brunel's principles,

306
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,230
and, in fact, greatly admired by him.

307
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:18,618
Dateless and impressive,
in a somewhat joyless style,

308
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,190
but inside this piece of engineering was art.

309
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,868
Well, funny things happen in the history of taste,

310
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,990
but I doubt very much if many of these objects
will ever come back into favour

311
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:32,818
the reason being that they are a giant spoof,

312
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,868
not responding to anything new

313
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,519
or controlled by any stylistic impulse.

314
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,308
But in France

315
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,348
at exactly the same time,

316
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,390
there emerged two painters

317
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,430
whose social realism
was in the centre of the European tradition,

318
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:54,460
Jean François Millet and Gustave Courbet.

319
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,670
They were both revolutionaries.

320
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,019
In 1848, Millet was probably a Communist,

321
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:02,538
although when his work became fashionable,

322
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,348
the evidence for this was rather hushed up.

323
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,390
Courbet remained a rebel

324
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,430
and was put in prison for his part
in the Commune, very nearly executed.

325
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:14,578
In 1849, he painted a picture
of a stone-breaker

326
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,710
Alas, destroyed in Dresden during the last war.

327
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:21,740
He intended it as a straightforward record
of an old neighbour,

328
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,098
but it was seen by a Communist friend,

329
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,868
who told him that it was the first great monument
to the workers, et cetera, et cetera.

330
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,868
Courbet was delighted by this idea

331
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,710
and said that the people of Ornans wanted
to hang it over the altar in the local church.

332
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:39,538
This, if it were true, which I very much doubt,

333
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,509
would have been the beginning
of its status as an "objet de culte",

334
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:45,940
which it has retained to the present day.

335
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,670
It's the indispensable picture
to all Marxist art historians.

336
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,940
The following year, Courbet painted
an even more impressive example

337
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,298
of his sympathy with ordinary people,

338
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,910
his enormous picture of a funeral
in his native town of Ornans.

339
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,348
By abandoning all pictorial artifice,

340
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,190
which must inevitably involve
a certain amount of hierarchy and subordination

341
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:15,700
and standing his figures in a row,

342
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:21,140
Courbet achieves a feeling of equality
in the presence of death.

343
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,308
How seriously he's accepted
the truth of each head.

344
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,028
But I mustn't leave you with the notion

345
00:25:33,108 --> 00:25:37,778
that the relationship between art and society
is as simple and predictable as this.

346
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:43,769
A pseudo-Marxist approach works fairly well
for the decorative arts

347
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,828
and for mediocrities.

348
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,190
But artists of real talent
always seem to slip through the net

349
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:53,019
and swim away in the opposite direction.

350
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,588
I'm standing in front of
one of the greatest pictures of the 19th century,

351
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,630
Seurat's Baignade in the National Gallery.

352
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,348
Although it contains factory chimneys

353
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,588
and a bowler hat and proletarian boot tabs,

354
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,108
it would be absurd to speak of it
as a piece of social realism.

355
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,990
The point of the picture is not its subject,

356
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:31,298
but the way in which it unites the monumental
stillness of a Renaissance fresco

357
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,670
with the vibrating light of the Impressionists.

358
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,180
It's the creation of an artist

359
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:39,980
independent of social pressures.

360
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:43,180
All the greatest pictures of the late-19th century

361
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,460
are quite different in subject and mood
from what one might expect.

362
00:26:47,548 --> 00:26:51,578
And, before one makes gloomy generalisations
about the period,

363
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,910
the miseries of the workers
the oppressive luxury of the rich and' so forth,

364
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,950
it's as well to remember that
among its most beautiful productions

365
00:27:00,028 --> 00:27:02,380
are these paintings by Renoir.

366
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,430
No awakened conscience.
No heroic materialism.

367
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:10,068
No Nietzsche. No Marx. No Freud.

368
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:14,700
Just a group of ordinary human beings
enjoying themselves.

369
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,700
(MUSIC) OFFENBACH: La Belle Hélene

370
00:28:52,108 --> 00:28:55,420
The Impressionists didn't set out to be popular.

371
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:57,778
The only great painter of the 19th century

372
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,420
who longed for popularity
in the widest possible sense

373
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:03,460
was, ironically enough,

374
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:08,490
the only one who achieved
absolutely no success in his lifetime,

375
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:10,538
Vincent Van Gogh.

376
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:19,588
In its earlier phase, the awakened conscience
had taken a practical, material form,

377
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,670
even Elizabeth Fry, with her powerful
religious gifts, had lots of common sense,

378
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,778
but in the later part of the 19th century,

379
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,950
the feelings of shame
at the state of society became more intense.

380
00:29:31,028 --> 00:29:35,098
Instead of benevolent action
there arose a need for atonement.

381
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,230
No-one expressed this more completely
than Van Gogh

382
00:29:39,308 --> 00:29:41,538
in his pictures, his drawings,

383
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,588
his letters and his life.

384
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,910
For the first part of his working life, he was torn
between two vocations, painter and preacher,

385
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,068
and for some years
the preacher was in the ascendant.

386
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,788
Preaching wasn't enough. Like St Francis,
he had to share the poverty of the poorest

387
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,230
and most miserable of his fellow men.

388
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:04,690
It wasn't the hardships
that made him give up this way of life,

389
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:08,019
it was his unconquerable need to paint.

390
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,670
Van Gogh's hero, the hero of almost all
generous-minded men in the late-19th century,

391
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,500
was Tolstoy.

392
00:30:18,588 --> 00:30:20,538
There he is, sawing wood,

393
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,588
expressing the feeling that one must share
the life of working people,

394
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,710
partly as a sort of atonement
for years of oppression,

395
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:32,500
partly because that life was nearer
to the realities of human existence.

396
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,910
Tolstoy towered above his age,

397
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,348
as Dante and Michelangelo
and Beethoven had done.

398
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,910
His novels are marvels
of sustained imagination.

399
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,990
His doctrines are full of contradictions.

400
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:58,220
He wanted to be one with the peasants,
yet he continued to live like an aristocrat.

401
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,828
He preached universal love,

402
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,868
but he quarrelled so painfully
with his poor demented wife

403
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,519
that, at the age of 82, he ran away from her.

404
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,788
After a nightmare journey,
he collapsed at a country railway station.

405
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:21,980
He was laid out on a bed
in the stationmaster's house.

406
00:31:23,028 --> 00:31:25,180
Almost his last words were

407
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:27,220
"How do peasants die?"

408
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,348
There he died

409
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,028
with all the horrors of modern publicity
stewing outside the station.

410
00:31:36,348 --> 00:31:39,778
After his death
when the peasants were singing a lament,

411
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,630
soldiers were sent in with drawn swords

412
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,259
to stop them from mourning
the subversive infidel.

413
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:50,538
However, there was no way
of preventing the funeral.

414
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:24,460
That scene took place in 1910.

415
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:29,490
Within two years, Rutherford and Einstein
had made their first discoveries

416
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:31,818
so a new era had begun

417
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,150
even before the 1914 war.

418
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,430
It's the era in which we're still living.

419
00:32:43,068 --> 00:32:45,098
The radio telescope at Jodrell Bank.

420
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,990
Of course, science had achieved
great triumphs in the 19th century,

421
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:54,500
but nearly all of them had been related
to practical or technological advance.

422
00:32:54,588 --> 00:33:00,140
For example, Edison, whose inventions did as
much as any to add to our material convenience,

423
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,548
wasn't what we should call a scientist at all

424
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,098
but a supreme do-it-yourself man.

425
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,750
But from the time of Einstein, Niels Bohr
the Cavendish Laboratory,

426
00:33:11,828 --> 00:33:16,338
science no longer existed to serve
human needs, but in its own right.

427
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,630
When scientists could use a mathematical idea
to transform matter

428
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,670
they'd achieved the same quasi-magical
relationship with the material world as artists.

429
00:33:28,028 --> 00:33:32,578
In this series, I've followed the ups and downs
of civilisation historically,

430
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,240
trying to discover results as well as causes.

431
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:38,940
Well, obviously, I can't do that any longer.

432
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:41,778
We have no idea where we are going

433
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,950
and sweeping, confident articles on the future

434
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:49,858
seem to me the most intellectually disreputable
of all forms of public utterance.

435
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,990
Scientists who are really qualified to talk
have kept their mouths shut.

436
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,348
JBS Haldane summed up the situation
when he said

437
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,990
"My own suspicion is that the universe
is not only queerer than we suppose,

438
00:34:04,068 --> 00:34:07,019
but queerer than we can suppose."

450
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,230
However, in the world of action
a few things are obvious,

451
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,780
so obvious that I hesitate to repeat them.

452
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,989
One of them is our increasing reliance
on machines.

453
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,530
They have really ceased to be tools

454
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,260
and have begun to give us directions.

455
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,940
Unfortunately, machines
from the Maxim gun to the computer

456
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,980
are, for the most part,

457
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:05,010
means by which an authoritarian regime
can keep man in subjection.

00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,420
(MUSIC) The grey wolf howls...

462
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,179
(Engines roar)

463
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,380
Our other speciality is the urge to destruction.

464
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:03,820
With the help of machines, we did our best
to destroy ourselves in two wars

465
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,349
and, in doing so, we released a flood of evil.

466
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,139
(Explosions)

467
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,268
(Air-raid siren)

468
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:39,820
Add to this, the memory of that shadowy
companion who is always with us,

469
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,670
like an inverted guardian angel,

470
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,110
silent, invisible

471
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,539
almost incredible

472
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:50,579
and yet unquestionably there...

473
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:56,659
..and one must concede that the future
of civilisation doesn't look very bright.

474
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,710
(Soundless)

475
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:17,650
(MUSIC) Shine Out, Fair Sun

476
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:40,260
And yet, when I look at the world about me
in the light of these programmes,

477
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,309
I don't at all feel that we're entering on
a new period of barbarism.

478
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,780
The things that made the Dark Ages so dark,

479
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,909
the isolation, the lack of mobility,

480
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,349
the lack of curiosity, the hopelessness,

481
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,389
don't obtain at all.

482
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,949
I'm at one of our new universities
the University Of East Anglia.

483
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,349
Well, these inheritors of all our catastrophes
look cheerful enough

484
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,059
and not at all like the melancholy late Romans
or pathetic Gauls,

485
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,219
whose likenesses have come down to us.

486
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:16,420
In fact, I should doubt if so many people
have ever been as well fed, as well read

487
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:21,179
as bright-minded, as curious and as critical,
as the young are today.

488
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,389
Of course, there's been a little flattening
at the top,

489
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,349
but, you know, one mustn't overrate the culture

490
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,949
of what used to be called "the top people"
before the wars.

491
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,860
They had charming manners,
but they were as ignorant as swans.

492
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,150
They knew a little about literature,
less about music

493
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,659
nothing about art
and less than nothing about philosophy.

494
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,070
The members of a music group or an art group
at a provincial university

495
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,380
would be ten times better informed
and more alert.

(MUSIC) And chop-cherry, chop-cherry ripe within...

507
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,389
Well, naturally,
these bright-minded, young people

508
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,780
think poorly of existing institutions

509
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,829
and want to abolish them.

510
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,789
One doesn't need to be young
to dislike institutions.

511
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,400
But the dreary fact remains

512
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,230
that, even in the darkest ages,

513
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,860
it was institutions which made society work.

514
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,670
And if civilisation is to survive

515
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,710
society must, somehow, be made to work.

516
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:22,030
At this point, I reveal myself in my true colours,

517
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,059
as a stick-in-the-mud.

518
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:30,539
I hold a number of beliefs that have been
repudiated by the liveliest intellects of our time.

519
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,429
I believe that order is better than chaos...

520
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,550
..creation better than destruction.

521
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,268
I prefer gentleness to violence,

522
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,309
forgiveness to vendetta.

523
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,389
On the whole, I think that knowledge
is preferable to ignorance,

524
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,429
and I am sure

525
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:57,050
that human sympathy
is more valuable than ideology.

526
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,469
I believe that, in spite of
recent triumphs of science,

527
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:07,250
men haven't changed much
in the last 2,000 years.

528
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,510
And, in consequence,
we must still try to learn from history.

529
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,739
History is ourselves.

530
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,750
I also hold one or two beliefs
that are more difficult to put shortly.

531
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,190
For example, I believe in courtesy,

532
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:30,869
the ritual by which we avoid hurting other
people's feelings by satisfying our own egos.

533
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:37,050
I think we should remember
that we are part of a great whole,

534
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,420
which, for convenience, we call Nature.

535
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,018
All living things are our brothers and sisters.

536
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:06,980
Above all, I believe in the God-given genius
of certain individuals

537
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:11,018
and I value a society
that makes their existence possible.

538

(MUSIC) TOMAS LUIS DE VICTORIA:
Responsories For Tenebrae

539
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,268
These programmes have been filled
with great works of genius.

540
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,670
In architecture, sculpture and painting.

541
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,710
In philosophy, poetry and music.

542
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,750
In science and engineering.

543
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,268
There they are. You can't dismiss them.

544
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:40,268
And they're only a fraction of what Western Man
has achieved in the last 1,000 years,

545
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,150
often after setbacks and deviations

546
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,768
at least as destructive as those of our own time.

547
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:52,539
Western civilisation has been
a series of rebirths.

548
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,030
Surely, this should give us
confidence in ourselves.

549
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,469
I said, at the beginning of the series,

550
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:05,179
that it's lack of confidence
more than anything else, that kills a civilisation.

551
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,389
We can destroy ourselves
by cynicism and disillusion,

552
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,550
just as effectively as by bombs.

553
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:19,219
50 years ago, WB Yeats, who was more like
a man of genius that anyone I've ever known,

554
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,070
wrote a prophetic poem and in it he said...

555
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:28,699
"Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold.

556
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,110
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

557
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:36,860
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed
and everywhere

558
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,389
The ceremony of innocence is drowned.

559
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,110
The best lack all conviction, while the worst

560
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:48,750
Are full of passionate intensity."

561
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,150
Well, that was certainly true between the wars
and it damn nearly destroyed us.

562
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,429
ls it true today?

563
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,820
Not quite, because good people
have convictions, rather too many of them.

564
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,150
The trouble is that there is still no centre.

565
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,460
The moral and intellectual failure of Marxism

566
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,500
has left us with no alternative
to heroic materialism

567
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,539
and that isn't enough.

568
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:24,059
One may be optimistic,

569
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:29,900
but one can't exactly be joyful
at the prospect before us.

570
