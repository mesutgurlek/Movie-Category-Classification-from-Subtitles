Colonel Potter.

Yes.

I'm the C.O.

What?

00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,989
Well, that's impossible.
There must be some mistake.

15
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:43,687
I've seen the man work.
I can assure you, Colonel...

16
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:46,993
there is no need
for an investigation.

17
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,765
Very well. If you insist.

18
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,131
It's none of my business, sir,
but your lips are turning white.

Provost marshal's office. They're sending
a colonel up here to investigate B.J.

20
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,907
- Wow!
- Claim he's an impostor, not a doctor.

21
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:04,346
Ooh! He took some blood
out of my arm the other day.

22
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,350
Radar, the man's a doctor.

Bad timing, my faithful camel.

A two-humper.

00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:23,594
Easy. Easy. Whoa, Habibi.
Whoa. Stop that!

30
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:27,332
Sorry, sir.
High-spirited camels spit.

- <i>Isn't she a beauty, sir?</i>

32
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:38,807
Those gleaming yellow teeth, set against
her brown camel-hair coat.

33
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:41,910
Klinger, I'm gonna write home
to my mom about this one.

34
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:45,718
With Habibi's permission,
oh "bespeckled" one of the pale flesh.

35
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:49,022
Look at her, Colonel.
Gracious transportation with economy.

36
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,187
A thousand miles per hump.

37
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:55,495
- Klinger, I got a big problem. Now blow.
- As you command, sahib.

38
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:57,501
Come, oh faithful
ship of the desert.

00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:59,503
Ah! Ah! Ah!
[Trills] Ah!

40
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:04,065
I can hear the call of the oasis now.
[Trills, Grunts]

41
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:08,511
Sir, I know there was
no camel in here, but there's a smell.

42
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:10,514
Lebanese aftershave.

<i>[Jet Passes Overhead]</i>

45
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:20,923
- Two trays, Klinger?
- One for me and one for my camel, Habibi.

46
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:23,655
Oh. Is your camel with you?

47
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:25,663
Right at my side.

48
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:27,756
I surmised that was the case.

49
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:31,701
Klinger, can I make
a personal observation?

50
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:34,864
Sure. Oh! Cease!
Stop curling your lips.

51
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:36,874
You'll get your potatoes.

52
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:40,070
If you'd take all the energy you devote
to these discharge schemes...

53
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,272
and put it into prayer...

54
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:44,406
the war would be over
and you'd be home.

55

My Toledo priest

So why don't I drop over to your tent
around 9:30 tonight?

61
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,531
I'll bring a canteen of gin and some
Fig Newtons and, uh, we'll, uh...

- Cheese it, the cops.
- Hawkeye.

- Father.
- Jennifer.
- Father.

64
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,543
- Don't let me interrupt.
- Oh, no. Nothing important.

65
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:15,409
We were discussing the ups and
downs of doctor/nurse relationships.

66
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:17,414
- Always the professional.
- Oh, yeah.

67
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:21,680
- Sir, can I eat? It's meat loaf.
- Enjoy the mystery.

68
00:04:21,787 --> 00:04:24,312
- Hawkeye, where's B.J.?
- Am I my doctor's keeper?

69
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:26,391
I've got to see him.
Something very important.

70
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:28,483
- What's up?
- There's a provost marshal coming here.

71
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:32,086
He's going to investigate B.J.
Claims he's an impostor, not a doctor.

72
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:35,099
I could have told you that.
He's a piano player in a bawdy house.

73
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:38,329
- Wild talk today.
- Your tapioca's blushing.

74
00:04:38,437 --> 00:04:41,304
I told this colonel it's crazy,
but they're still investigating.

75
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,170
- Who's investigating?
- The provost marshal.

76
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:44,674
- Who? Me?
- You.

77
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:47,507
- Say you're not a doctor.
- Shucks, I knew they'd find out.

78
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:49,808
- Excuse me.
- Don't go. After B.J. Exposes himself...

79
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,815
- there's gonna be dancing.
- Oh, sure.

80
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,317
- It goes on and on.
- I think he's a spy.

81
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,753
- Are you a spy?
- I'm not allowed to say.

82
00:04:57,857 --> 00:05:00,348
Pierce, I've had a bad day.

83
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,290
What league
are the Brooklyn Dodgers in?

84
00:05:02,394 --> 00:05:05,090
- League of Women Voters.
- So far he's right.

85
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:07,131
Who got down on one knee
and sang "Mammy"?

86
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:09,133
- Father Mulcahy.
- Right again.

87
00:05:09,235 --> 00:05:11,226
I prefer to observe
rather than participate in this.

88
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:13,237
Colonel Potter, I must
talk to you right away.

89
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:14,829
- Is it medical?
- No, it's personal.

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,840
- Not now, Major.
- It's important!

91
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,967
It's always important!

92
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:21,512
When's the last time I came to you?
I ask so little.

93
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:24,344
- And she gives so much.
- You stay out of this!

94
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,385
- I'm out! I'm out!
- Please, Colonel, I must see you right away.

95
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:29,852
All right.
In my office in half an hour.

96
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,082
The army has no gratitude.

97
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:34,751
- Talk to the owners.
- Listen, you guys, serious up.

98
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,760
That colonel will be here
this afternoon.

99
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:39,353
Come on. This is ridiculous.
The army has all my credentials...

100
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:42,593
Acme Medical School. Residency
at Joe's Hospital and Auto Supply.

101
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:45,101
And then there's my practice
at Schultz's Mortuary.

102
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:49,573
I know all that,
but this Colonel What's-his-name...

103
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:52,405
Bardonaro...
sounded pretty sure of himself.

104
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,708
[Chuckles] W-Wait a minute.
Is that Leo Bardonaro?

105
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,908
- That's the bird.
- [Laughs]

106
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:02,454
The spy laughed, refusing
both cigarette and blindfold.

107
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:04,716
Leo Bardonaro is an old friend
of mine from Stanford.

108
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,690
Stationed not far from here.
He lives for practical jokes.

109
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,920
I knew there had to be
a herring in the pickle barrel.

110
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:13,089
This whole bit must be his way of saying
he's gonna come see me this afternoon.

111
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,099
- You're not a spy?
- Sorry.

112
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,637
You've ruined my whole evening.
I was gonna take a date to your execution.

113
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:24,876
- [Brakes Squeak]
- Yeah. You gotta watch out for this guy.

114
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:27,445
You never know what he's gonna do.
He was best man at my wedding.

115
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:30,242
Formal occasion,
so he wore a white towel and black tie.

116
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,682
- No carnation?
- My honeymoon, he put a lizard in my alligator bag.

117
00:06:33,786 --> 00:06:35,720
- So your bag wouldn't be lonely.
- Naturally.

118
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:38,153
<i>Yo, B.J.!</i>

119
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:40,521
- Leo! Hey, how you doing?
- Great. Great.

120
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:43,561
Good to see you.
Leo Bardonaro, Hawkeye Pierce.

121
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:46,426
Uh... Just checking
for a hand buzzer.

122
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:49,592
Oh, come on.
Kid stuff. No imagination.

123
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:52,262
Hey, listen. You really
had our C.O. Going crazy earlier.

124
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,464
Really? That's great.

125
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:56,564
- How 'bout a belt?
- Uh, did he make it?

126
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:59,166
No, no, no. I manufacture.
He's just a shipping clerk.

127
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:01,610
- Oh, good. Cigar?
- No, thanks.

128
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,614
- Oh. B.J.?
- Sure.

129
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:06,480
What, are you crazy?
It's probably loaded.

130
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:08,485
Kid stuff.
We gave that up 10 years ago.

131
00:07:08,587 --> 00:07:10,987
Our practical jokes are creative.
We don't put bombs in cigars.

132
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,149
It spoils the taste.
I'll take that one.

133
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,758
- Eh...
- Here. Gimme that. Here.

134
00:07:17,863 --> 00:07:20,093
Hey, remember that time
in the dean's office?

135
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,190
Mmm!
[Laughs]

136
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:25,099
One time... One time
we stole a taxicab.

137
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:28,935
Took it apart completely and put it
back together in the dean's office.

138
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:33,641
- With the meter running, I hope.
- Ran it up to 800 bucks.

139
00:07:35,447 --> 00:07:38,507
Mm.
[Coughs]

140
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:40,517
What do you call this stuff?

141
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:43,452
- Old underwear.
- Strained through G.I. skivvies.

142
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:45,750
- Terrific.
- Leo, what brings you up to the boonies?

143
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:47,758
- I'm goin' home.
- [Groans]

144
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,762
Hey, I had to say good-bye. Got my orders
in my jacket. I'm heading stateside.

145
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:55,857
- You dog. I would give anything to go home.
- What, are you homesick?

146
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:58,835
He cries himself to sleep so often,
he's gotta wear water wings to bed.

147
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,599
It's lucky you bunk with a guy
that's got a sense of humor.

Ha!
[Trills, Grunts]

296
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:25,845
- You sure you put everything in there?
- Yes, sir.

297
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,885
- Daily reports and duty logs.
- Good man.

298
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:32,555
I also put in some of
your ear swabs, sir.

299
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:34,887
Good. I wax up on these trips.

300
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:36,893
Where the hell is Hawkeye?

301
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:39,190
Captain Pierce!

302
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:42,130
Keep shouting like that,
you'll break your glasses.

303
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:44,134
Sorry I'm late.
My zipper was mildewed.

304
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:47,228
Let's go. Left at Chang Yung,
right to Miju...

305
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,432
left at Chikchisa,
then Yang Pong into Seoul.

306
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,441
Got all that?

307
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,443
- I'll follow the yellow brick road.
- Whatever.

308
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:58,715
- Hi.
- Shut up. Get a call through to my husband...

309
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:02,878
Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscott,
H.Q., Second Army Division, Tokyo.

310
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:06,719
Oh, sorry, ma'am, colonel's orders.
No personal calls until after 1700 hours.

311
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:09,123
How would you like to be
up to your knees in floor?

312
00:16:09,227 --> 00:16:12,060
Roger. Sparky?

313
00:16:12,164 --> 00:16:14,598
Sparky! Oh, hi, Sparky.
It's Radar.

314
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:17,224
Listen, I gotta
get through to Tokyo.

315
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:19,235
- Oh?
- What?

316
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:21,703
Uh, Sparky,
this is top priority.

317
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:24,401
Uh-huh.

318
00:16:24,509 --> 00:16:26,409
Yeah.

319
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:29,309
Um, I'm sorry, ma'am.
One of their generators burned out...

320
00:16:29,414 --> 00:16:31,712
and they won't get
another frequency till after midnight.

- [Screams]

322
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,917
Oh, look what you've done!
My in-going and my outgoing.

323
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:39,354
- Now it's all in my out.
- Stuff it, you little shrimp!

324
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,516
- What l...
- No! No, no, no.

325
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,890
- Ma'am, ma'am, this is all official stuff.
- I'm sick of it!

326
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:45,895
- I'm sick of all of you!
- Oh, no!

327
00:16:45,997 --> 00:16:48,864
- I'm sick of the army!
- That's all in alphabetical order!

328
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,094
For Pete's sake!

329
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,228
"Oh, we need you, Houlihan.
We need you."

330
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:55,829
Always me! Always me!
Why? Why? Why?

331
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:59,433
Well, you've been in the army a long time.
You're older.

332
00:16:59,544 --> 00:17:01,444
Thanks for nothing!

333
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:05,243
You're very dependable
and kind to the enlisted.

334
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,217
This man occupied
a hotel room adjacent to mine.

335
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,949
He created an inordinate
amount of smoke, interrupting my...

336
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:13,957
official dictation...

337
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,027
motivating me
into a drafty hallway.

338
00:17:16,127 --> 00:17:18,220
But, General, the duty logs,
the daily reports.

339
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:22,061
Everything shows
that Captain Hunnicutt was at the 4077.

340
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,567
Well, anybody
could have signed those.

341
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,570
That's the oldest dodge
in the army.

342
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,334
- I have Captain Pierce as a witness.
- He was with me in surgery.

343
00:17:30,442 --> 00:17:32,706
I took some shell fragments
out of a South Korean soldier.

344
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:35,575
Right. That corporal who gave you
the water buffalo horn for an ashtray.

345
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,081
What time were you two
supposed to be in surgery?

346
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:44,147
Uh, right here.
Um, 0600 to 1117.

347
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:46,747
Plenty of time
to get to Seoul by chopper.

348
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:50,316
He never left camp.
We had a company sock wash that night.

349
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:55,058
Colonel, did you witness
this... company sock wash?

350
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,963
Uh, it was for the younger crowd.

351
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:00,735
General, we have
overwhelming evidence.

352
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,501
So do I.

353
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,735
Photostat of the hotel register.

354
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:09,143
"B.J. Hunnicutt
and a party of favorites"?

355
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:11,545
Sir, that's not my signature.

356
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,710
That signature could be forged.
The oldest dodge in the army.

357
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:16,980
All boils down
to your word against ours.

358
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:19,921
What do these say to you?

359
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:22,858
Always trust your car
to the man who wears a star.

360
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:26,328
- Clam up, Captain!
- [Hawkeye Mumbles]

361
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,365
I have additional evidence.

362
00:18:28,466 --> 00:18:31,526
Hunnicutt, you left in such a hurry,
you left your hat.

363
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:34,469
- Sir, that's not my hat.
- Put it on.

364
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,666
General, I have never seen this hat
as long as my head has lived.

365
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:40,108
There's one way to prove it.
Put it on.

366
00:18:43,381 --> 00:18:46,111
It's his hat, all right.

367
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:50,313
[Potter] Let's celebrate
our victory over the brass.

368
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,322
Pull over
under that tree, Hawkeye.

369
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:55,120
- Rest stop!
- B.J., break out one of those bottles.

370
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:57,126
You got it!

371
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,460
Practical jokes.
You can have them.

372
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:03,466
- That miserable Bardonaro.
- Ahh!

373
00:19:03,568 --> 00:19:05,559
That'll clean your rifle barrel.

374
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,570
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

375
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,640
Easy, Hawkeye, easy.

376
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:12,869
Don't talk to the driver
while he's drinking.

377
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:15,674
- Practical jokes are really cruel.
- Right.

378
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,509
- Right. Vicious.
- Right.

379
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,276
- Sadistic.
- I couldn't agree more.

380
00:19:19,384 --> 00:19:22,649
If I ever see that Bardonaro again,
I'll break every sadistic bone in his body.

381
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:25,154
Ah, you'll see him again.
Remember when I took his coat?

382
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:27,383
- Huh?
- In the Swamp, with the cigar bit?

383
00:19:27,492 --> 00:19:29,824
- I took his coat?
- Yeah?

384
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:32,692
I swiped his travel orders.

385
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,998
Colonel Potter? Colonel Potter,
I gotta speak to you.

386
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,010
Get rid of this
dead soldier, soldier.

387
00:19:47,112 --> 00:19:49,239
- Sir, but I still gotta speak to you.
- You walk funny.

388
00:19:49,347 --> 00:19:51,406
- Poor toilet training.
- Colonel, this is important.

389
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:54,815
- Radar, baby. Kiss me, you fool.
- Whew! Holy mackerel.

390
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,012
Colonel, you gotta do something
about Major Houlihan.

391
00:19:57,122 --> 00:20:00,182
- An officer and a gentleman.
- You gotta let her see her husband or something.

392
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,191
You know what she did?
She kicked me...

393
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:05,091
and then she messed up my files
from "M" to "Z" and everything.

394
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:07,426
- And then she got mad.
- <i>Colonel Potter!</i>

395
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:10,524
- Oh!
- Say no more. You've convinced me.

396
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:13,331
Get packed. You're going to Tokyo.
Give my love to Donald.

[Shrieks]

398
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:20,806
You know, I like
a major with hot lips.

399
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:22,812
- And I'll tell you why.
- Why?

400
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:24,814
Exactly.

401
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:30,153
- Did I fall down?
- No.

402
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:32,189
I didn't think so.

403

<i>Klinger. Klinger. Klinger.</i>

404

Ah, Colonel, sahib.
You have returneth.

405
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:44,760
Good news, bugle beak.
I brought a discharge from Seoul.

406
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:47,804
Oh, be still my throbbing heart.

407
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:52,138
It's for the camel.
He can pack his humps and leave anytime.

408
00:20:52,243 --> 00:20:55,144
It's always the other guy.

Oh, Leo! Oh, you!

- You creep!
- Hey, look, fellas.

412
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:06,413
I'm really sorry about
the General Fox thing. Okay?

413
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:08,424
Sorry don't feed the bulldog.

414
00:21:08,526 --> 00:21:10,960
- No, seriously. I'm very sorry.
- Uh-huh.

415
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:14,031
I didn't know General Fox
was right next door.

- B.J.?
- Yeah.

418
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:21,198
- Can I have my travel orders back?
- Tr-Travel orders?

419
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:23,365
What travel orders?
I haven't seen any travel or...

420
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:26,501
- Have you seen any travel orders?
- I saw my first robin.

I haven't seen my folks for two years.

- Come on. Come on.
- All right. All right.

424
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:36,215
- No, no, no, no. Don't do it.
- It's okay.

No, I don't have any wheels.

Wheels! Take our jeep.
It's parked in front of the hospital.

- Clockwise.

00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,932
- Hi. Hey, B.J.
- Huh?

446
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:33,204
- While you was away, this mail come for you.
- Okay. Thank you, Radar.

447
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:39,445
- Bardonaro!
- Bardonaro, you creep!

448
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:42,543
Bardonaro! You see...
Look what he did.

449
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,020
[Laughs]
Look what I got.

450
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:48,092
A bill from that hotel
in Seoul, in my name...

451
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:52,095
for damages... 580 bucks.

452
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:57,401
[Laughing]
We...

453
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,732
What the hell are we laughing at?

454
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,772
Well, he'll be walking
back here in about an hour.

455
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:04,774
He'll be walking back?

456
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:06,969
The only thing gassed up
in that jeep was us.

457
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:18,580
- To my dear wife.
- To my darling wife.

458
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,523
To Goldie, the waitress
at Barney's Bar and Grill.

459
00:23:22,627 --> 00:23:24,686
- <i>[Knocking]</i>
- Come in.

460
00:23:26,231 --> 00:23:29,325
- Hi.
- Well, look who's back.

461
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:32,902
- <i>[Potter] How was Tokyo?</i>
- Oh...

462
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:36,098
- Never mind Tokyo. How's Donald?
- He's in wonderful shape.

463
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:40,109
- He's so relaxed now.
- Good. Is that a jug?

464
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,236
Thank you for giving me leave.

465
00:23:42,347 --> 00:23:44,338
Thank you.

466
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:48,044
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some things to rinse out.

467
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:50,552
- <i>[Hawkeye] Would you do my underwear?</i>
- <i>[B.J.] And my socks?</i>

468
00:23:50,655 --> 00:23:54,682
[Laughs]
Another time, Captains.

469
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:57,693
- Huh.
- Didn't even get a rise out of her.

470
00:23:57,795 --> 00:24:00,559
She's no fun
when Donald's relaxed.
