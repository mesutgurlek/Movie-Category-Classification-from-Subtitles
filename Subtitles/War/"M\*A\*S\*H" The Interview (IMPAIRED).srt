1
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:54,543
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>The following is in black and white.</i>

2
00:00:58,586 --> 00:01:01,282
This is a room in Korea...

3
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:04,813
a room most of the men
fighting the second year of the war...

4
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:06,860
would rather not see.

5
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:12,194
This is an operating room in a MASH...
a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital.

6
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:15,292
There are five of these units
in South Korea.

7
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:18,964
The concept of treating wounded
close to the front...

8
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:22,736
this particular hospital
is just three miles from the fighting...

9
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,335
is being tested for the first time.

10
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:29,644
If anything can be said to be
a success in war, it is this concept.

11
00:01:29,717 --> 00:01:32,117
By bringing the wounded
directly to the operating table...

12
00:01:32,186 --> 00:01:34,984
by jeep, ambulance and helicopter...

13
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:39,253
these units have achieved
an effectiveness of 97%% .

14
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:45,287
In human terms, 97 out of every 100
wounded men brought here <i>live.</i>

15
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:49,166
Who are the people
behind that most impressive statistic?

16
00:01:49,236 --> 00:01:52,694
We brought our camera
and our microphones here to find out.

17
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:55,765
<i>Some of their saltier comments</i>
<i>have been deleted.</i>

18
00:01:55,843 --> 00:02:01,008
Do you see anything good at all
coming out of this war?

19
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:03,641
Yeah. Me. Alive.

20
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:06,584
That would be nice, if I could get out
of this alive. That would be great.

21
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:10,215
- You've been here some time.
- Somewhere between some time
and eternity.

22
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:14,694
Is there anything from home
that you brought over with you
to set up for yourself?

23
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:16,696
Creature comforts?

24
00:02:16,764 --> 00:02:18,698
- I brought... I brought a book over.
- What book?

25
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:23,430
The dictionary. I figure
it's got all the other books in it.
I like to read the dictionary.

26
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:27,736
What do you feel was
the most difficult thing you
had to adjust to over here?

27
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:31,505
I think it's that
everything is painted green.

28
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:35,344
The clothes are green.
The food is green...

29
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,408
except the vegetables, of course.

30
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:40,544
The only thing that's not green
is the blood.

31
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,454
The blood is red.
That's what you get the most of here.

32
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:45,651
Number one with me is the toilet seats.

33
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,660
They give you slivers and splinters.

34
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:50,094
You can't really reach around
and take them out yourself.

35
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:54,066
Boy! That's when you find out
who your friends really are. Ha!

36
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:59,071
The almost criminal lack of respect
of military respect and discipline.

37
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:02,666
Some say that's too much
to expect of doctors.

38
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:06,270
I don't see any harm
in doctors being ordered to behave
as patriotically as possible.

39
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:09,680
Doesn't patriotism
have to come from the heart?

40
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,082
I don't have that problem.

41
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:14,484
You gotta understand.
I'm not working on sick people here.

42
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:16,921
I'm working on <i>hurt</i> young people...

43
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,289
with essentially healthy bodies
that have been insulted by ammunition.

44
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:23,694
What's the attitude of the boys
towards you, towards your work?

45
00:03:23,764 --> 00:03:26,790
I try to get to know them,
but then there's so many.

46
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,859
They move through here pretty fast.
At least we hope they do.

47
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:35,034
I do hold services,
but, uh, well, they...

48
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:40,945
I don't pack 'em in, you know.
Not... Not that that's important.

49
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:46,042
They spread us religious fellows
rather thin over here.

50
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,453
'Course they spread everything
kind of thin over here.

51
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:52,151
I'm not complaining.

52
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:55,423
I don't mind being the only priest here.

53
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:59,330
It's sort of fun to have
a corner on the market, but...

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,334
Well, uh...
What was the question?

55
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:05,304
A lot of the boys
look up to you as a father figure.
Do you get that feeling?

56
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:09,365
I suppose they do, and that gets to be
a pain in the [Beep] too.

57
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:12,241
I don't mean that
in a nasty sort of a way.

58
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:14,610
I know it's perfectly natural.

59
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:17,775
That's what I think part of my duty
as a commanding officer is.

60
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:22,083
To accept that, and to give it back
in the best way that I can.

61
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:24,249
What do you do
when you're not working?

62
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:26,349
Then I specialize in boredom.

63
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:28,554
There must be a good deal of that.

64
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,792
- And let's not forget fright.
- Tell me about that.

65
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:34,732
The fright or the boredom?
We have a special on boredom this week.

66
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:36,360
[Laughs]
Tell me about the boredom.

67
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:40,931
- Do you mean what do
I do when I'm bored? Is that...
- Yeah. What do you do?

68
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:44,375
Uh, well, um...

69
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:48,176
I mostly do the same thing I do
when I'm not bored, only I do it slower.

70
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:52,947
Bored. How many times can
you watch those training films
they send over here?

71
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,318
<i>V.D. Is the Enemy</i>
and <i>Don't Let This Happen to You.</i>

72
00:04:55,389 --> 00:04:58,051
I'd like it to happen to me
to break up the boredom.

73
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,059
Just kidding, honey.

74
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:01,856
You got a little woman back home?

75
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:05,660
I'm married, yeah.
LaVerne Esposito.

76
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:08,701
Terrific gal. Great gal.

77
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:12,261
She went to Toledo Waite High School.
That's on the Hungarian side of town.

78
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:15,831
<i>Incidentally,</i>
<i>if you're ever in Toledo, Ohio,</i>
<i>on the Hungarian side of town</i>...

79
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:19,675
Tony Paco's greatest Hungarian hot dogs,
with chili peppers, 35ct.

80
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:22,306
And a cold beer... Stroh's Bohemian.

81
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,646
And El Verso cigars.

82
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:26,652
Well, I, uh...

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,689
- I don't know if this is
interesting or anything.
- Go ahead.

84
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:32,224
Uh, I grow earthworms.

85
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:37,059
I, uh, dug a ditch... like a trench...
out behind the O.R.

86
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,189
I filled it up with peat moss and stu...

87
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:42,758
Well, not exactly peat moss,
'cause I couldn't requisition any.

88
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:46,067
So, what I did was...
Well, l... I took...

89
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,508
Well, you know
when they re-dig the latrine...

90
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:52,568
Can you say "latrine" on television?

91
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:54,341
Let's find out.

92
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:57,542
Well, anyhow,
there's lots of ash and stuff, you know.

93
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,916
I took that stuff,
and I put it in the hole.

94
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:03,252
Then I went looking for some earthworms.
I put them in there.

95
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:07,487
You know, earthworms double in 60 days.
They must really be in love.

96
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:12,828
Oh, there must be 160,000...
180,000 earthworms in there.

97
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,765
And now what happens?

98
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:18,862
Well, I figure I'd give most of them
away to the farmers around here...

99
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:21,100
'cause they need all the help
they can get.

100
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:25,133
And, uh, earthworms are really good
with dirt. Is this too technical?

101
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:27,680
- No, no. Go ahead.
- <i>Well, uh</i>...

102
00:06:27,748 --> 00:06:31,377
I figure I'll give most of them
to the farmers, and the rest I'll race.

103
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:33,851
You <i>race</i> earthworms?

104
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:36,947
- Yeah. I got this cockroach
in a jar, you know?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

105
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:41,188
I didn't name him or nothing.
He's just number six.
One through five died.

106
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:43,195
Or maybe number six ate them.
I don't know.

107
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:47,063
They're pretty hard up too, you know?
Cockroaches. Over here.

108
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:51,298
Anyhow, I put him in this track
with the worm, and then I race 'em.

109
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:54,497
Unlike most of your doctors,
you're regular army.

110
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:56,668
This is my third war.
I was in the big one...

111
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:58,802
and the Second World War
and now Korea.

112
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,143
I hope war is getting smaller
as a trend.

113
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:04,672
I've been asking if something special
is coming out of this...

114
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:07,185
in the way of medical
or technical developments.

115
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:10,348
Oh, there are some things
that get a practical trying-out here...

116
00:07:10,424 --> 00:07:13,154
that maybe wouldn't
with the same speed back home.

117
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:15,956
But when you counterbalance
that with the frightful expense...

118
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:20,022
the frightful destruction
and loss of life, I don't think
it's an equal balance.

119
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,034
Do you see anything <i>good</i>
coming out of this?

120
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:24,434
Not a damn thing.

121
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:26,631
I mean, Korea will become
a shining example of...

122
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:30,006
the American policy
of benign military intervention.

123
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:34,275
I think it's the most stupidest thing
in the world.

124
00:07:34,348 --> 00:07:37,078
You call it a police action
back home, right?

125
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,084
Over here, it's a war.

126
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:42,121
"A police action" sounds like
we're over here arresting people...

127
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:44,384
handing out parking tickets.

128
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,367
War is just killing.
That's all.

129
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,093
Do you get scared, frightened?

130
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,694
Yeah, very frightened.
Very frightened.

131
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:55,572
- What do you lean on then?
- Mostly terror. There's always
terror to fall back on.

132
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:58,737
You know what it's like?
It's like a car accident.

133
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:01,475
You know,
everything goes into slow motion?

134
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:05,883
You suddenly see things
for the way they really are.

135
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:08,888
You say to yourself,
"Oh, so that's what it's like...

136
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,481
to have a bomb explode
a few feet away from me."

137
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,424
Do you ever get hit here?

138
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,054
Oh, they bombed the crap
out of us a number of times.

139
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,064
Uh, there, it's al... it's...

140
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:23,035
The beams shake, and the dust
falls into your patient. It's not nice.

141
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:25,334
Any other times you were afraid?

142
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:27,874
At night.

143
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,877
Sometimes at the beginning
of the night, sometimes...

144
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:34,073
before dawn.

145
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:38,983
When you realize
that you're not sleeping, and...

146
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:41,749
you suddenly
begin to think of where you are...

147
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:45,019
and what could happen to you.

148
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:48,027
Then you notice that the cot is shaking.

149
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,962
You wonder why the cot is shaking.

150
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,966
It's because your heart is pounding.

151
00:08:53,034 --> 00:08:56,401
Sometimes I get frightened
for the patients we have to handle...

152
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,200
these young kids
that come in all shot up.

153
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:04,643
It's very difficult to observe all this
and not occasionally be scared by it.

154
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:06,646
<i>How would you describe yourself?</i>

155
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:11,413
<i>Are you a captain</i>
<i>in the U.S. Army Reserves</i>
<i>or are you a civilian in uniform?</i>

156
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:15,854
I'm a...
temporarily misassigned civilian.

157
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:17,652
Can you describe what you do?

158
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:21,024
Essentially, I'm on call
for all medical emergencies...

159
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:24,394
but I've never seen a situation here
that wasn't an emergency.

160
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:29,198
I did three amputations
before I had my first breakfast here.

161
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,171
Our surgeons, uh,
do what needs to be done.

162
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,073
Anesthesiologist one day,
orthopedist the next.

163
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,406
Psychologist pretty much all the time.

164
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:39,844
How in the world
do you keep your morale up?

165
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:43,850
I stopped having morale
about six months ago.

166
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,546
- It's not really morale
you have here either.
- What is it?

167
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:49,818
- Is it... pure survival instinct?
- Yes. Yeah, yeah.

168
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,155
It's like an overcoat that I take out
every once in a while and put on.

169
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:58,290
See, what I do is, I try to
provoke other people into disbelief.

170
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:01,563
Then when I see that disbelief
in their eyes, then I know I'm here.

171
00:10:01,636 --> 00:10:04,799
Otherwise
it's like looking into a mirror
and not seeing anything.

172
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:09,002
Everybody's got that self-involved glaze
over their eyes a little bit.

173
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,010
They all have their own problems,
you know.

174
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,243
I think what it's like is, uh,
like what Milton Berle does for people.

175
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,911
They just can't believe it.

176
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:22,285
It gives them something to look at
for a while. It's like a public service.

177
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,688
<i>How do you manage</i>
<i>to stay sane over here?</i>

178
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,920
There are certain tricks
to staying sane...

179
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,360
little things you can do.

180
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,092
For instance, if you wear your underwear
outside your pants...

181
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,293
for three days straight
just to see who notices...

182
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:36,359
that's a very good way of staying sane.

183
00:10:36,437 --> 00:10:39,702
- <i>Is there anything from home</i>...
- Actually, another thing you could do...

184
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:43,608
is you could get out in the road there,
where the jeeps are coming by...

185
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:46,078
and everybody stick your foot
out in front of the jeep.

186
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:49,412
The last one to pull his foot in...
is the sane one.

187
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,974
How did you pick the military
as a career?

188
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:56,012
I got into the cavalry as a kid,
excited by the glamour of it.

189
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,183
Then I went into medicine.

190
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:03,458
I don't say it isn't, and hasn't been,
especially in the olden days,
a glamorous occupation...

191
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:07,592
particularly the cavalry,
which was very romantic.

192
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,694
But remember those were the days
of Douglas Fairbanks...

193
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,296
and Francis X. Bushman too.

194
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:18,175
I love horses.
I'd rather spend a day with a horse,
still, than most of the people I know.

195
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:23,649
- <i>Has this whole experience</i>
<i>changed you in</i> any <i>way?</i>
- Certainly not.

196
00:11:23,718 --> 00:11:29,623
I may care about things more
than I ever have before, because, uh...

197
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,989
there's so much more
to care about here.

198
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,429
On the other hand, I really don't
give a [Beep] what happens.

199
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:43,562
Just doesn't matter anymore, I think.

200
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:48,506
I mean,
I've seen so many people to whom...

201
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:51,010
killing is a casual thing.

202
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,071
I don't know how we manufacture
people like that, but it, uh...

203
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:57,379
It seems to me
that we'll never run out of them.

204
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,386
When I first came here,
I couldn't walk down a corridor...

205
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,615
full of wounded people
without being sickened by it.

206
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,624
Now I can walk down
without noticing them.

207
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,922
You have to use a mental anesthesia.

208
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:09,360
Otherwise you bleed
for everybody who's bleeding...

209
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,160
the refugees, the orphans...

210
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:16,169
the wounded children,
the other doctors and nurses.

211
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,262
If you get caught up in their misery
too deeply,

212
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,398
you get into a hole
you can't climb out of.

213
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:23,534
When the doctors...

214
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:26,637
cut into a patient...

215
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:28,875
and it's cold, you know...

216
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,976
the way it is now, today...

217
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:37,046
steam rises from the body...

218
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,457
and the doctor will...

219
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,729
will warm himself over the open wound.

220
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:52,834
Could anyone look on that
and not feel changed?

221
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:58,470
Captain, what about authority?
You have respect for authority
over here?

222
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:01,242
That's what really killed me
when I first came over here.

223
00:13:01,315 --> 00:13:04,341
There were so many people
who thought they had a right
to tell me what to do.

224
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:08,377
That really was amazing.
I never saw anything like that.

225
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,390
My shoes!

226
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:14,394
You'd be surprised
how many people are interested in shoes
when you come into the army.

227
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,760
You don't meet many people
out in the real world...

228
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:19,163
who are interested in shoes
the way they are in the army.

229
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:23,135
It's a fascination for them.
You might even say a grand obsession.

230
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:26,901
It's pretty hard to have
the kind of authority here...

231
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:31,308
you would have in a regular army unit,
because these guys aren't soldiers.

232
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,312
They're doctors.

233
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,818
And, uh, you just can't handle them
the way you would regular army men.

234
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,820
And I don't want to...

235
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:45,018
because the results
wouldn't be what we're getting now.

236
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,526
Can you tell me about the people
with whom you're working?

237
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:49,825
Finest kind.

238
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,888
Everybody is terrific here.
Everybody pitches in.

239
00:13:51,966 --> 00:13:55,993
The doctors carry litters.
The nurses check up on the doctors.
The nurses are great.

240
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,471
The nurses work very hard. They get...
They don't get nearly enough credit.

241
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,474
The nurses are preposterous.

242
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:06,138
Ladies doing work
that up until a very short time ago
I would have thought was man's work.

243
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,341
They do it so well
under every kind of circumstance...

244
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:13,682
bitter cold, horrendous heat...

245
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:15,745
literally under the gun.

246
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:19,259
They don't make nurses
better anywhere.

247
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,886
Perhaps that's not the best way
to phrase that.

248
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,988
Competent. Competent. Yes.

249
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,999
A woman...

250
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:31,504
especially, is so...

251
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:36,942
well, is a wonderful source
of comfort and tenderness...

252
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:38,945
and hope.

253
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:41,846
They give back life.
Can you do better?

254
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:45,682
Probably in school,
somewhere in the growing-up process...

255
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:50,087
you've read a lot of Hemingway and his
reports from Madrid in the Spanish War.

256
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:53,593
He romanticized that war.
I think you might agree.

257
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:57,062
Do you agree now with romanticizing war?

258
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,691
You know...

259
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,203
I used to love reading Hemingway...

260
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,296
'cause he wrote so well.

261
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:11,811
But now that I'm here,
I can't understand why anybody
would willingly go to a war...

262
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,315
would go with enthusiasm...

263
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:19,978
would want to be there
while it's happening.

264
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:23,393
I'd do anything to get out of here.
It's crazy.

265
00:15:23,527 --> 00:15:27,657
- What about your colleagues?
- I only went as far as high school, sir.

266
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:30,529
Do you have any heroes over here,
anyone you look up to?

267
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,230
Oh, you mean the doctors.
The doctors are really terrific.

268
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:37,705
Heck, the doctors
are the whole ball game here.

269
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:41,210
I guess I'm my only hero,
but I'm too cowardly to admit it.

270
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:44,145
Nah, I don't...
I don't think I have any heroes.

271
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:47,183
My great hero would be
Abraham Lincoln, I think.

272
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:52,244
I think in so many ways
he was the most interesting
American that ever lived.

273
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:54,256
He would have been a great doctor.

274
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:58,727
Such a gentle man,
had such compassion, such humor...

275
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:01,263
and yet there was
a terrific toughness about him.

276
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:04,562
He was a real fighter
right up to the very end.

277
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:07,865
He was of the common people,
and he never lost that.

278
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:10,566
A man like Harry Truman
is that kind of man...

279
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,600
decent and earthy, forthright,
honest, not a buck-passer.

280
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,139
Men like Lincoln and Truman
if they had an assignment,
by God, they did it!

281
00:16:20,217 --> 00:16:23,709
They didn't assume...
people are inclined to do, these days...

282
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:26,381
sort of weasel a decision.

283
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:28,720
They looked at the problem, acted...

284
00:16:28,792 --> 00:16:30,987
and took the responsibility for it.

285
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:33,859
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>of President Eisenhower?</i>

286
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,864
Well, he's a general.

287
00:16:35,932 --> 00:16:37,490
Do you ever get leave?

288
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,535
Of my senses.

289
00:16:39,603 --> 00:16:41,798
The other kind
you don't get too much.

290
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:43,930
You take it wherever you can get it,
you know?

291
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:46,771
Once I went to Tokyo.
I won a contest.

292
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:49,277
- <i>You have fun?</i>
- Yeah, I had a lot of fun.

293
00:16:49,346 --> 00:16:53,214
- <i>What did you do?</i>
- I don't remember.

294
00:16:53,283 --> 00:16:55,877
I guess I got a little drunk.

295
00:16:55,952 --> 00:16:58,853
You said something... You said
there's a lot of drinking around here.

296
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:00,913
Is there a lot of drinking here?

297
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:04,324
- Did I say that?
- <i>Yeah, you said that.</i>

298
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:07,261
"A lot" is a relative term.

299
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:12,393
We do considerable drinking
as opposed to sitting at home.

300
00:17:12,469 --> 00:17:15,461
We do not enough drinking
as opposed to being here.

301
00:17:15,538 --> 00:17:18,302
What do you think will happen
when the U.S. Leaves?

302
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,003
I don't know.

303
00:17:21,077 --> 00:17:24,069
If I knew all the answers,
I'd run for God.

304
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:27,639
Do you get to meet the South Koreans?
Do you know them?

305
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:29,651
Yeah, they're n...
they're nice people.

306
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,710
I worry about 'em though.

307
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:37,420
We got a girl here that was...
you know, pregnant.

308
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:41,555
She doesn't have any money or anything.
I don't know how these kids live.

309
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,963
I mean, some of'em don't.
That's the God's honest truth.

310
00:17:44,034 --> 00:17:45,968
Some of'em don't even live over here.

311
00:17:46,036 --> 00:17:48,664
- Do you help them?
- We do the best we can...

312
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:51,138
but we haven't got...
I mean, we got just...

313
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:55,109
Sometimes
we got just enough for ourself.
Penicillin and stuff like that.

314
00:17:55,178 --> 00:18:00,309
I mean, I really wish somebody
would tell these people back home this.

315
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:05,878
When you have to
look these kids in the face,
that's where it's really at.

316
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:08,924
I mean,
that's what the ball game really is...

317
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:10,926
is looking these kids in the face here.

318
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:13,586
Can you tell me what you miss most?

319
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:17,759
- Oh, you mean, back home-wise?
- <i>Yes.</i>

320
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:23,795
Well, my family of course... my wife,
my children. They're my strength.

321
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:25,807
I'm one of those that feels...

322
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:29,311
that marriage is the headstone
of American society.

323
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:34,510
Pistachio ice cream...
and bananas.

324
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:38,850
And pancakes.
I miss... And, uh, bacon frying.

325
00:18:38,922 --> 00:18:41,550
The smell of bacon in the morning,
waking up to that.

326
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:43,558
It's a long time since I smelled that.

327
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:47,323
I miss my wife, of course...
miss my son, daughter-in-law.

328
00:18:47,397 --> 00:18:51,026
I have a new baby grandchild.
I haven't seen her. I'd like to.

329
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:53,535
One of the things I miss the most...

330
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:56,401
is people my own age for companionship.

331
00:18:56,473 --> 00:19:00,933
I'm old enough to be the father
of almost everyone around here,
and then some.

332
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,379
You just miss being able
to sit around and chew the fat
with somebody your own age...

333
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,507
somebody with your own background...

334
00:19:07,584 --> 00:19:10,485
well, not background,
but your own experiences.

335
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,919
- <i>[Helicopter Whirring]</i>
- What about you, Doctor,
when the war is over?

336
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,756
I've got a lot of lost time
to make up to my family.

337
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:20,455
- <i>Where is home?</i>
- The Bay Area, San Francisco.

338
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,124
Specifically Mill Valley,
is where I live.

339
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:27,761
That's where Peg is,
and my daughter Erin.

340
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:30,101
She's lovely.

341
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:32,198
She squeezes your nose.
[Laughs]

342
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:35,506
Well, first thing I want to do
is see my mom.

343
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:38,775
Then I got this '41 Chevy
that I'm fixin' up.

344
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:42,113
A neighbor swapped me it
for one of our pregnant sows.

345
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:44,244
It sounds like
you come from farm country.

346
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,721
Yes, sir!
Iowa. Ottumwa, Iowa.

347
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,725
Nobody famous ever come from there...

348
00:19:49,793 --> 00:19:53,889
except once, Eleanor Roosevelt's car
got stalled at our train crossing.

349
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:56,227
Some people heard the screaming,
and they said,

350
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,393
"That sounds
just like Eleanor Roosevelt!"

351
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:03,098
Well, there's my practice, of course.

352
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:06,472
I might just write a book
about my experiences here.

353
00:20:06,543 --> 00:20:08,414
Possibly go into politics.

354
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,140
Would you give up medicine?

355
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:13,515
Some people think
I could be more useful if I did.

356
00:20:13,586 --> 00:20:16,282
After the war <i>what,</i> Father?

357
00:20:16,355 --> 00:20:20,155
Oh...

358
00:20:20,226 --> 00:20:23,684
I, uh... I'd like to be...

359
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:28,427
warm and clean...

360
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:33,529
and hear confessions
and maybe run the C.Y.O.

361
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:38,908
I'd like to take six to seven months
and become unconscious.

362
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:43,813
Just sleep... not do anything,
not go anyplace...

363
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:46,579
not have anything asked of me.

364
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:49,314
Then I'd like to go to Europe
and sleep there for a year.

365
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:51,822
You want to say hello
to anybody back home?

366
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:55,850
You're kid... You mean on camera,
on TV I can say hello?

367
00:20:55,928 --> 00:21:00,194
Hey, hey! You're kidding me.
I can really say hello on camera?

368
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:05,431
Yeah, I'd like to say hello
to my wife, LaVerne.

369
00:21:05,504 --> 00:21:08,735
Won't be long now, honey,
I'll be home.

370
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:13,040
My mom and my dad, Butch...
That's his nickname, Butch...

371
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:15,444
and my sister, Yvonne, and, uh...

372
00:21:15,514 --> 00:21:18,415
and all the guys there
at Leo's Grill and J And J's Sweet Shop.

373
00:21:18,484 --> 00:21:20,714
Hey, hey, guys!
[Laughs]

374
00:21:20,786 --> 00:21:23,311
I had to come over here to be a star.
[Laughs]

375
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:25,755
Would you like to say hello
to your family?

376
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:28,885
Oh, well, yes.

377
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:30,895
Hello.

378
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:34,694
Hello, darling.

379
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:38,897
Hi, sweetheart.
I love you.

380
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:41,997
We haven't got a TV.

381
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:44,975
The nearest one is over at Grange Hall
in, uh, Mooseville.

382
00:21:45,044 --> 00:21:47,308
It's about 50 miles.

383
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,406
'Bout two-hour drive in the Chevy
or an hour by foot.

384
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,781
I'm sure your folks
would make the trip to see you.

385
00:21:55,154 --> 00:21:57,816
Hi, Mom and Uncle Ed.

386
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,450
- Is this too personal?
- <i>No.</i>

387
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:02,460
It's Walter.

388
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:07,022
Um, I really miss you
and I love you.

389
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:10,865
Anyone at home you'd like to
say hello to, to send a message?

390
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:13,097
- <i>They'll see it.</i>
- Well, there is...

391
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:17,074
but I just don't think that's dignified,
so I won't do it.

392
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:21,910
[Laughs]
Oh, I don't have to say hello.

393
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:24,575
I know how everybody feels about me.

394
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,777
Yes, I'd like to say hello
to Harry Truman...

395
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:29,582
and I'd like to know
why Bess hasn't written me back.

396
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:31,384
You actually wrote her?

397
00:22:31,457 --> 00:22:33,891
Yes, I wrote her
a very heartfelt letter.

398
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:36,450
Maybe she's too touched
to respond yet, huh?

399
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:39,760
No, I think she doesn't like me.
That's the only conclusion I can draw.

400
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:41,959
I was very specific
about what I liked about her.

401
00:22:42,034 --> 00:22:44,161
I even suggested things.
She hasn't written back.

402
00:22:44,236 --> 00:22:47,034
You'd think I'd have
at least heard from Harry.

403
00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:50,507
Could have at least called
me a son of a [Beep].
He's done it for others.

404
00:22:50,576 --> 00:22:55,070
These men and women with whom you work,
you want to see them after the war?

405
00:22:55,147 --> 00:22:58,480
I'm torn between the idea
of the love I have for these people...

406
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:01,042
and wanting that relationship
to continue...

407
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,987
and wanting to erase all the memories
I have of this place.

408
00:23:04,056 --> 00:23:06,422
Colonel,
you've spoken of the father figure.

409
00:23:06,492 --> 00:23:09,188
Do you think that after the war
you'll want to maintain...

410
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:14,028
a friendship or a connection
with these young men and women
after this is over?

411
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,093
- Absolutely.
- <i>Do you think you will?</i>

412
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,195
I'm not sure about that...

413
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:24,265
but I hope I will,
and I hope they will with me.

Very, very close...

to some of these young men...

417
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,387
and very honored
to be associated with them.
