Tell me about James Notley.

171
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:40,148
That man was a pain in my ass.

172
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:42,516
He smuggled dinosaur bones
out of the state of Wyoming

173
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,301
and sold them overseas.

174
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,457
Ergo, he was a rank opportunist

175
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:49,373
and a speed bump on the road
to scientific progress.

176
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:52,169
So, how does a speed bump
manage to smuggle dinosaur bones

177
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:53,778
out from under your nose?

178
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:56,114
Well, in the summer of 1989,
the university dug up

179
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:58,750
a complete skeleton
of a Triceratops.

180
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:01,786
It was valued at $800,000.

181
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:05,090
And Notley waited
until they crate the thing up.

182
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:07,092
Shows up at the university,

to load the crates into a van.

185
00:08:11,397 --> 00:08:13,198
About a week later,
I get him to confess.

186
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:15,267
By cutting that off?

187
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:18,336
By busting
the bastard's alibi, nephew!

188
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:21,171
Anyway, he had all his fingers
when I saw him last week.

189
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,610
As I recall,
the two middle ones

190

and robust.

191

Money.

By the time
I'd arrested Notley,

194
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:33,718
he had already unloaded
them fossils,

195
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:35,518
but there was no sign
of the cash he made off of 'em.

196
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:37,639
And I knew
he'd stash it someplace.

197
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:38,907

No.

On the finder's fee.

201
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,732
And as I told Notley,

202
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,393
a finder can command up to,
I don't know,

203

50% of any missing money
he finds.

204
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:54,926
Why would James
want to give you half of 50%?

205
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:57,348
Because he knew
I'd either find the money

206
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,009
or find him with the money.

207

You did this
at Connie's request?

Damn right I did,

809

and on her dime.

810
00:36:50,857 --> 00:36:52,691
She paid me 15 grand.

811

Where do you think Connie got
that kind of money from?

Who knows?
I mean, her job?

She's an occasional hairdresser,
works out of her house.

814

So unless she got
a pretty big tip...

815

Oh, shit.

You mean Connie
has James' 800 grand?

Did you forge that letter
you found in James' cell?

818

I didn't have to.

819
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:14,613
James wrote it himself
and gave it to me.

820
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:16,062
Connie was telling him
about some friend

821

that had been buying sailboats

and taking vacations
in the Caribbean.

All of a sudden, James starts
getting all paranoid

- about this friend.
- Riley Manning.

She was playing us
the whole time, wasn't she?

and spent it.

Come on.

Connie, is there anything
you want to say to Hank?

He's gonna be going away
for quite a while.

834

I believe in mercy, sheriff.

But anybody who did
what he did to James

836

deserves whatever's coming.

And, Connie,

Achilles.

About 3,000 years ago.

I think it's a poem
about a man's destructive rage.

Achilles was a warrior.

I would not disagree with that.

So Achilles confronted
his friend's great enemy.

901
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,828
Achilles gave the man
one warning...

And what happened
to this enemy?

Achilles ran his sword
through the man's guts

and dragged his dead body
around the town.

could this enemy have done
anything otherwise?

He could have got out of town
