00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,341
I'm in charge.

339
00:35:23,406 --> 00:35:26,669
Neely, only reason
you got that stripe

340
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:29,842
is you too bold-ass dumb
to think for yourself.

341
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:54,669
Are you a general?

342
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:58,014
General, huh?

343
00:35:58,078 --> 00:36:01,533
No, just a captain.

344
00:36:01,598 --> 00:36:04,684
How many men you killed?

345
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:08,013
You really want to know?

346
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:13,341
None.

347
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:26,940
Rodie?

348
00:36:27,006 --> 00:36:28,396
What?

349
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:31,100
You feel cool and deliberate?

350
00:36:32,717 --> 00:36:34,396
Nothing's moving.

351
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,979
Damn.

352
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:29,147
We should...
We should bury them.

353
00:37:29,244 --> 00:37:31,226
We'd have to hang
around to do that.

354
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,242
You want to hang around?

355
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:40,650
Hyah!

356
00:38:02,475 --> 00:38:04,587
Want a chew?

357
00:38:21,818 --> 00:38:23,722
Thank you.

358
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,394
[Horses neigh]

359
00:38:36,553 --> 00:38:37,529
Captain.

360
00:38:37,593 --> 00:38:39,401
There was a farm burnt down.

361
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:42,360
Some old man and
his wife were killed.

362
00:38:42,425 --> 00:38:43,625
Where?

363
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,017
There.

364
00:38:45,082 --> 00:38:47,224
No more than 5 Miles up the creek.

365
00:38:48,649 --> 00:38:50,633
You know whose place it is?

366
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,360
Yankees.

367
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:53,961
Ma'am, they weren't Yankees.

368
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:56,745
Just some old farmer
and his wife.

369
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,680
They sent two boys
into the Union army.

370
00:39:07,401 --> 00:39:09,768
They were just farmers.

371
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:19,784
<i>Like I said, the war
was rough through here.</i>

372
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:19,494
How'd you sleep?

373
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:25,798
You're going to be fine, soldier.

374
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:06,229
Uh, how's Newt?

375
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:08,165
We're out of turpentine.

376
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:12,212
Captain, what do we do?

377
00:41:14,918 --> 00:41:18,580
Oh...
I don't know.

378
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:22,309
We need to feed the boys
back at the Cumberland Gap.

379
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:25,349
And that old farmer
and his wife.

380
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:28,084
We should report back

381
00:41:28,149 --> 00:41:31,876
that there's some
guerrilla outfit

382
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:34,917
running around killing Unionists.

383
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:37,844
I think we got to wait Newt out.

384
00:41:37,909 --> 00:41:42,708
He's too sick to ride.

385
00:41:42,773 --> 00:41:45,380
We could hitch up the wagon
to the mule,

386
00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:47,636
haul Newt out.

387
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:50,228
Giddyup, giddyup.

388
00:41:50,293 --> 00:41:52,404
I won't let that
woman and boy

389
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,291
root hog or starve.

390
00:41:54,356 --> 00:41:56,260
No. No, sir.

391
00:42:05,508 --> 00:42:06,452
Whoa.

392
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,740
Will you let me do that?

393
00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:14,323
I don't need your help.

394
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:18,083
Well, I like working with mules.

395
00:42:21,893 --> 00:42:23,971
How's your hands?

396
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:28,323
Blisters on top of blisters.

397
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:32,211
Let me see.

398
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:35,026
Let me see.

399
00:42:50,996 --> 00:42:53,058
All right.

400
00:42:54,387 --> 00:42:56,178
That's fine. Thank you.

401
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,146
Come on!

402
00:43:50,914 --> 00:43:53,506
I told you I got you.

403
00:43:53,555 --> 00:43:57,313
I told you.

404
00:43:57,378 --> 00:44:01,041
Captain, Newt took a poop.

405
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:06,161
I guess that's a good sign.

406
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:17,025
Rodie, make sure
you clean up this porch.

407
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:26,831
My stomach hurts.

408
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,344
Worse than yesterday?

409
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:31,488
Mm-mmm.

410
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:37,872
Oh, you'll be fine.

411
00:44:37,937 --> 00:44:40,464
You're not as hot.

412
00:44:43,616 --> 00:44:45,695
How's he doing?

413
00:44:45,761 --> 00:44:48,751
He's fine.

414
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,215
I'll make you some
sassafras tea.

415
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,920
She's pretty.

416
00:45:05,824 --> 00:45:07,791
You are feeling better.

Hey, Johnny, I'm sorry.

You crossed my artillery line there.

Here, I'll let you spit back.

423

Go ahead.

424
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,551
You're scaring the boy.

425
00:45:31,615 --> 00:45:33,502
No, he ain't scared.
Are you, Johnny?

00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:41,390
Go ahead...

you got a mean streak.

Yes, yes.

That damn Johnny dog

Soldier, I want you
to apologize.

I'm telling you, captain,
that woman is crazy.

If you want another plate,
you'll apologize.

you don't pick up a woman

Rodie, shut up.

Plowing her corn.
You cut her wood.

I'm sure she thinks you're
a damn good samaritan.

You know what I think?

00:50:06,056 --> 00:50:09,527
I think you just want
a little poke.

We can't just sit by.

to preacher's house.

473
00:51:05,815 --> 00:51:07,750
And tell him that
there's Yankees here,

474
00:51:07,816 --> 00:51:09,702
and he should get word
to our people.

475
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,750
Don't talk to anyone
but preacher.

476
00:51:11,816 --> 00:51:13,814
And you have to be back
before sunup.

477
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:16,269
- You understand me?
- Yes, ma'am.

These are yours.

And I'm sorry.

481
00:51:42,564 --> 00:51:44,372
There was some...

482
00:51:44,776 --> 00:51:47,565
ugly things said tonight about...

483
00:51:49,638 --> 00:51:51,365
They weren't true.

No?

485
00:51:58,054 --> 00:52:00,389
Don't think they were true.

3 years ago.

Miss my farm, my boy.

490

I come here to your place,

491
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:28,500
and it looks a lot
like my place...

492
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:36,580
We ain't gonna be friends.

493
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:41,108
Let's just keep
to being enemies.

494
00:52:43,444 --> 00:52:44,980
Yes, ma'am.

495
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:50,164
I forgot.

496
00:52:50,229 --> 00:52:52,307
You have a better memory.

00:53:36,467 --> 00:53:37,794
Is Newt asleep?

499
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:41,138
Yeah.

500
00:53:48,596 --> 00:53:52,626
You know,
I don't think Rodie

501
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:55,362
mean to be disrespecting.

502
00:53:58,786 --> 00:54:02,657
His brother was killed
by a rebel sniper.

503
00:54:04,019 --> 00:54:07,281
He get crazy thinking
about it. He's...

01:11:38,776 --> 01:11:40,599
Giddyup!

677
01:11:52,665 --> 01:11:55,415
What do you expect us to eat?

678
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:56,934
Ma'am.

679
01:11:59,127 --> 01:12:01,542
I says, what do you
expect us to eat?

680
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,766
Ma'am, that husband of yours...

681
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:09,782
Why don't you
bring him home?

682
01:12:09,847 --> 01:12:11,574
We'll all eat good.

683
01:12:13,751 --> 01:12:16,599
I'm leaving your rifle.

684
01:12:18,759 --> 01:12:21,030
Maybe the boy can
shoot squirrels.

685
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:49,109
Ma'am, I took your powder.

686
01:12:57,014 --> 01:13:00,325
Let's go.

687
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:03,509
I thought she was
sweet on him.

688
01:13:03,574 --> 01:13:05,973
No, you can't trust johnnies.

689
01:13:06,038 --> 01:13:06,917
Come on, mule.

690
01:15:33,874 --> 01:15:35,265
Whoa, shit!

691
01:15:38,338 --> 01:15:39,602
What the hell happened?

[Gunshots]

693
01:16:51,824 --> 01:16:54,031
I want you both to stay here.

694
01:16:54,096 --> 01:16:55,103
Yes, sir.

695
01:17:00,848 --> 01:17:03,151
What's he doing?

696
01:17:03,215 --> 01:17:07,071
I think he's wanting
to kill somebody.

697
01:17:20,144 --> 01:17:21,343
Ohh!

698
01:17:22,607 --> 01:17:23,967
What'd you do?

699
01:17:25,471 --> 01:17:26,830
What'd you do?

700
01:17:26,895 --> 01:17:28,031
I shot.

701
01:17:28,096 --> 01:17:29,135
Shot what?

702
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:30,430
I heard shooting.

703
01:17:30,496 --> 01:17:31,853
I shot a Yankee.

704
01:17:31,919 --> 01:17:35,070
Do they know it was you?
Do they?

705
01:17:35,135 --> 01:17:37,198
I don't know.

706
01:17:37,262 --> 01:17:39,534
Come on! Come on!

Sarah Anders!

708
01:18:23,486 --> 01:18:25,628
Did you forget something?

709
01:18:27,678 --> 01:18:29,998
Newt was shot about
a mile down the creek.

710
01:18:30,426 --> 01:18:32,156
- You know anything about it?
- No.

711
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,572
Where's your boy?

712
01:18:34,637 --> 01:18:36,717
I sent him up the spring.

713
01:18:39,293 --> 01:18:42,476
Boy! Come here!

714
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:51,757
Your pants are wet.

715
01:18:54,157 --> 01:18:56,524
I was up at the spring.

716
01:18:59,789 --> 01:19:01,516
He was up at the spring.

717
01:19:02,941 --> 01:19:04,220
Come here, boy.

718
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:09,132
Come here!

719
01:19:11,996 --> 01:19:13,868
Now, did you kill Newt?

720
01:19:13,933 --> 01:19:15,372
You look at him.

721
01:19:15,437 --> 01:19:17,019
Did you kill Newt?

722
01:19:21,661 --> 01:19:25,452
Your mother might tell you that
it's all right to kill Yankees.

723
01:19:25,829 --> 01:19:28,410
But I just want you to know
that that boy...

724
01:19:28,508 --> 01:19:31,420
He had a brother just like you.

725
01:19:31,484 --> 01:19:33,259
And he had a family just like you!

726
01:19:33,324 --> 01:19:35,372
And he never hurt a fly in his life!

727
01:19:35,436 --> 01:19:38,594
And he wouldn't be dead If you hadn't
come down here stealing from us!

728
01:19:38,973 --> 01:19:41,116
We was doing fine until
you showed up.

729
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,251
Don't blame it on...

730
01:19:47,564 --> 01:19:50,811
Go ahead...

731
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:52,138
Kill us.

732
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:26,954
You know it scares me.

733
01:20:31,307 --> 01:20:33,305
'cause I could.

734
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:41,354
I really could.

735
01:20:57,482 --> 01:21:00,920
I just hope whoever
killed Newt...

736
01:21:00,985 --> 01:21:04,191
Has the common decency
to give him a Christian burial.

737
01:21:56,488 --> 01:21:58,440
What'd you do to them?

738
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,319
You heard the shots.

was about being decent.</i>

745

the big redhead</i>

Meshack Creek.</i>

<i>Ma said he come up that creek
to cause trouble,</i>

748
01:23:41,765 --> 01:23:45,205
<i>and we sent him back down
where he come from.</i>

749
01:23:52,405 --> 01:23:55,445
<i>We drug the skinny
Yankee up a hill</i>

750
01:23:55,494 --> 01:23:57,460
<i>to a sinkhole.</i>

751

had fallen over</i>

<i>and turned up its roots.</i>

753

<i>We throwed the skinny Yankee
in the sinkhole,</i>

754
01:24:06,773 --> 01:24:08,724
<i>throwed some dirt on him.</i>

755

<i>I don't guess Ma hated
the skinny Yankee</i>

756
01:24:12,053 --> 01:24:15,044
<i>as much as the big redhead.</i>
