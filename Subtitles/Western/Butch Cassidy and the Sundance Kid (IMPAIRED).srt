2
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:44,395
Good night, Pat.

3
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:45,658
Good night.

4
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,404
What happened to the old
bank? It was beautiful.

5
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:52,905
People kept robbing it.

6
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:55,774
That's a small price to pay for beauty.

7
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:03,021
Hit me.

8
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,589
Again.

9
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:12,898
Bust!

10
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:17,653
Give me credit, Mr. Macon?

11
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:20,792
You know my rules, Tom.

12
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:25,147
Well, it looks like you just about
cleaned everybody out, fella.

13
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,818
You haven't lost a hand
since you got the deal.

14
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,356
What's the secret of your success?

15
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:35,360
Prayer.

16
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,130
Let's just you and me play.

17
00:05:55,524 --> 00:05:56,422
Hit it.

18
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:02,931
Bust.

19
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:09,504
Yeah, you're a hell of
a card player, fella.

20
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:13,543
I know, 'cause I'm a
hell of a card player,

21
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:17,013
and I can't even spot
how you're cheating.

22
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,097
The money stays, and you go.

23
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:37,371
Well, we seem to be

24
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,373
a little short on brotherly love

25
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:40,580
around here.

26
00:06:40,815 --> 00:06:43,376
If you're with him, you
better get out of here.

27
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:44,880
We're on our way.

28
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,382
I wasn't cheating.

29
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:47,384
Come on.

30
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:48,885
I wasn't cheating!

31
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:51,390
You can die. You can both die.

32
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:52,890
You hear that?

33
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,895
If he invites us to stay, then we'll go.

34
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:58,398
He's got to invite us to stick around.

35
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:00,867
He'll draw on you.

36
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:03,474
You don't know how fast he is.

37
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:14,318
I'm over the hill, but
it can happen to you.

38
00:07:14,557 --> 00:07:16,821
That's just what I want to hear.

39
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,325
Every day you get older. That's a law.

40
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,338
What would you think about

41
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:32,876
maybe asking us to stick around?

42
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:33,877
What?

43
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:36,345
You don't have to mean it or anything.

44
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:38,883
Just ask us to stick
around. I promise...

45
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:48,395
I can't help you, Sundance.

46
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:02,045
I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid

47
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:03,980
when I said you were cheating.

48
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,654
I draw on you, you'll kill me.

49
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:12,192
There's that possibility.

50
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:14,828
You'd be killing yourself.

51
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:18,299
Why don't you just
invite us to stick around?

52
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,902
You can do it...

53
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:23,405
and easy.

54
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:25,635
Come on.

55
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,314
Come on.

56
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:33,322
Why don't you stick around?

57
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:36,526
Thanks, but we got to get going.

58
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:44,334
Hey, Kid.

59
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:47,199
Hey, Kid, how good are you?

60
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,718
Like I been telling you...

61
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,050
over the hill.

62
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,089
Boy, you know,

63
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,267
every time I see
Hole-In-The-Wall,

64
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,765
it's like seeing it for the first time.

65
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,802
Every time, I ask myself
the same question...

66
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:11,035
how can I be so damn
stupid to keep coming back?

67
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:19,284
What's your idea this time?

68
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:20,525
Bolivia.

69
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:24,058
What's Bolivia?

70
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:26,822
Bolivia... that's a country, stupid.

71
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:28,329
Central or South America.

72
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:30,434
One or the other.

73
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:32,468
Let's go to Mexico instead.

74
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:34,972
All they got in Mexico is sweat.

75
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,940
There's too much of that here.

76
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,946
If we'd been in business
during the California gold rush,

77
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:43,483
where would we have
gone? California, right?

78
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:46,190
When I say Bolivia, you
just think California.

79
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:48,656
You wouldn't believe
what they're finding

80
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:50,691
in the ground down there.

81
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,192
They're just falling into it.

82
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:54,697
Silver mines, gold mines, tin mines.

83
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:58,702
Payrolls so heavy we'd strain
ourselves stealing them.

84
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,106
You just keep thinking, Butch.

85
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,110
That's what you're good at.

86
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:06,611
Boy, I got vision,

87
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:09,649
and the rest of the
world wears bifocals.

88
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:33,243
Hi, News. What you doing?

89
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:37,819
Aw, howdy, Butch. Uh, nothing.

90
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,319
Nothing.

91
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,719
Howdy, Sundance.

92
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,756
You sure are. You're
doing something. What?

93
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:48,764
<i>Just fixing to rob the
Union Pacific Flyer, Butch,</i>

94
00:11:49,003 --> 00:11:51,973
like what we had in mind.

95
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:56,441
You fellas got everything
I told you all wrong.

96
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,581
<i>Sure, we might hit the Flyer,</i>

97
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,546
but even if we do, it won't be this run.

98
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:03,982
It'll be the next one, the return.

99
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,488
Sundance and me, we
been checking the banks.

100
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,623
No banks.

101
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,623
What?

102
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,228
<i>The Flyer, Butch.</i>

103
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:16,199
Fellas, bad as they are,
banks are better than trains.

104
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:18,202
They don't move. They stay put.

105
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:20,204
You know the money's in there.

106
00:12:20,443 --> 00:12:21,934
When I left, I gave orders.

107
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:23,975
New orders been given.

108
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:25,978
I run things here, Harvey.

109
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:27,980
Used to you did.

110
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:29,653
Me now.

111
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:33,052
This don't concern you.

112
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:37,764
You tell him to stay out.

113
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:40,491
Well, he goes his own way, like always.

114
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:42,532
What's the matter with you guys?

115
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:44,034
When I came here,

116
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,003
you were nothing. I formed you.

117
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:47,004
Who says?

118
00:12:47,243 --> 00:12:49,007
Read them a clipping, News.

119
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,008
Which one?

120
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,306
Any of them.

121
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,786
<i>This one here's from Salt Lake Herald.</i>

122
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:02,086
“Butch Cassidy's
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang...”

123
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:03,126
That's me!

124
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:05,662
You want Harvey to do your planning?

125
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,665
Want him to do your thinking for you?

126
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:10,668
You want him to run things?

127
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:12,568
Shut up now, News.

128
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:15,074
Not till I get to the good part.

129
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:17,577
“Also known to have
participated in the holdup

130
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:20,113
are Flat Nose Curry and News Carver.”

131
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:23,414
I just love to read my
name in the paper, Butch.

132
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,455
So we just forget
about Logan taking over,

133
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:27,661
O.K., Flat Nose?

134
00:13:27,895 --> 00:13:29,157
You always said

135
00:13:29,364 --> 00:13:31,332
that any one of us could challenge you.

136
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:33,831
'Cause I figured no one would do it.

137
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:35,297
Figured wrong, Butch.

138
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,496
You guys can't want Logan!

139
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,173
At least he's with us.

140
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:43,676
You been spending a lot of time gone.

141
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,679
Well, that's because
everything's different now.

142
00:13:45,918 --> 00:13:47,180
Guns or knives, Butch?

143
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:49,684
You got to plan more, prepare more.

144
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:51,116
Guns or knives?

145
00:13:51,324 --> 00:13:52,053
Neither.

146
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:53,089
Pick!

147
00:13:53,361 --> 00:13:56,388
I don't want to shoot with you, Harvey.

148
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:58,793
Anything you say, Butch.

149
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:19,316
Maybe there's a way to
make a profit in this.

150
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,925
Bet on Logan.

151
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:23,927
I would, but who'd bet on you?

152
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,155
Sundance...

153
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:29,333
when we're done and he's dead,

154
00:14:29,572 --> 00:14:31,666
you're welcome to stay.

155
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:34,207
I don't mean to be a sore loser,

156
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:37,075
but when it's done,
if I'm dead, kill him.

157
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:38,578
Love to.

158
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:49,392
No, no. Not yet.

159
00:14:49,632 --> 00:14:51,224
Not until me and Harvey

160
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:52,992
get the rules straightened out.

161
00:14:53,236 --> 00:14:55,397
Rules in a knife fight?

162
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,301
No rules.

163
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,772
If there ain't any
rules, let's get started.

164
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:01,707
Someone count 1, 2, 3, go.

165
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,708
1, 2, 3, go.

166
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,785
I was really rooting for you, Butch.

167
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:11,582
Well, thank you, Flat Nose.

168
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,990
That's what sustained
me in my time of trouble.

169
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,796
<i>Hey, what's this about the Flyer?</i>

170
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:20,331
Harvey said we'd hit it

171
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,334
both this run and the return.

172
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,838
<i>Nobody's done that to the Flyer before.</i>

173
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:27,341
No matter how much we got at first,

174
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,605
they'd figure the return was safe

175
00:15:29,882 --> 00:15:31,373
and load it up with money.

176
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:32,847
Harvey thought of that?

177
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:34,348
Yes, sir, he did.

178
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,352
I'll tell you something, fellas.

179
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:37,250
That's exactly what we're going to do.

180
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:16,772
Stop it.

181
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,670
Where?

182
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,176
Up ahead there.

183
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,348
Bet that's old Butch himself.

184
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:32,224
Hold it there.

185
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:35,226
Just thought I'd watch.

186
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:37,730
Bring the kids, why don't you?

187
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:39,264
Stick your heads in.

188
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:42,771
You're just going to
get yourself blown up

189
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:44,805
you don't open that door.

190
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:47,809
I can't do that. I work
for Mr. E.H. Harriman

191
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,811
of the Union Pacific Railroad. He...

192
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,814
Shut up about that E.H. Harriman stuff

193
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:52,815
and open up.

194
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,317
What's going on?

195
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:56,286
We got a patriot in there.

196
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,322
That's young Woodcock.
He's awful dedicated.

197
00:16:58,561 --> 00:16:59,323
Woodcock?

198
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:00,258
Yes, sir.

199
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:02,466
You know who we are?

200
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:05,497
You're the Hole-In-The-Wall
Gang, Mr. Cassidy.

201
00:17:05,737 --> 00:17:06,999
I understand that,

202
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:11,006
but Mr. E.H. Harriman
himself give me this job.

203
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:13,040
I got to do my best.

204
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,544
Your best don't include
getting yourself killed.

205
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:16,714
Dynamite's ready.

206
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:19,078
Mr. E.H. Harriman himself
had the confidence...

207
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,381
Open the door, or that's it.

208
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,886
You think E.H. Harriman

209
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,218
would get himself killed for you,

210
00:17:25,428 --> 00:17:26,395
Woodcock?

211
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,895
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman

212
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,929
of the Union Pacific Railroad,

213
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:32,568
and he entrusted me...

214
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:49,253
Hey, Woodcock.

215
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:51,256
Woodcock, you all right?

216
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:52,757
Hey.

217
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,520
Hmm?

218
00:17:59,438 --> 00:18:02,032
Whatever Harriman's
paying you ain't enough.

219
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,185
There ain't what I'd call
a fortune in there, Butch.

220
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:16,688
Well, just so we come out ahead.

221
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,791
That's the main thing.

222
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:19,720
The
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang

223
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:20,886
The
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang

224
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:24,898
<i>just robbed the Flyer
right outside of our town,</i>

225
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,435
so that makes it our responsibility

226
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,007
to get out there and get after them.

227
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,541
You'll have to bring your own horses.

228
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,772
How many of you can bring your own guns?

229
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:43,085
How many of you will want
me to supply you with guns?

230
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:48,466
Well... come on now.

231
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,761
I think it's up to us to
do something, don't you?

232
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:53,471
What's the point?

233
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:54,765
They're probably halfway

234
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,475
to Hole-In-The-Wall
already.

235
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,941
That's exactly why we have got to hurry.

236
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:00,909
If we mount up right now

237
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:02,844
and get out there after them,

238
00:19:03,084 --> 00:19:04,848
maybe we can head them off.

239
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,352
If we did that, they'd kill us.

240
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:11,324
We don't want to let
them get away with this.

241
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:12,392
[Saloon Girls Singing]

242
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,862
Boy, I just eat this up with a spoon.

243
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:18,866
All right, youse two,
I want you at my party.

244
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:19,867
What party?

245
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:21,869
I'm losing my piano player.

246
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:24,373
He's going off to fight the war.

247
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:26,103
What war?

248
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:28,009
The war with the Spanish.

249
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,219
<i>Remember the Maine.</i>

250
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:31,715
Who can forget it?

251
00:19:31,988 --> 00:19:34,583
I'm giving him a send-off. so come on.

252
00:19:43,936 --> 00:19:44,869
Goodbye, Dolly

253
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:46,367
I must leave you...

254
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:48,369
When I was a kid,

255
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:51,271
I always thought I would grow up

256
00:19:51,512 --> 00:19:52,673
to be a hero.

257
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:54,177
It's too late now.

258
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,885
Why'd you say something like that?

259
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,315
You didn't have to say
something like that.

260
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:01,320
You want me to go alone

261
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:03,824
and fight the
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang?

262
00:20:04,096 --> 00:20:05,358
That's fine with me.

263
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:08,329
If you want your kids
to know you let me,

264
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:10,126
<i>that's fine with me,</i>

265
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:13,805
but I don't think that's what you want.

266
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,133
Is it?

267
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:22,213
Why don't we enlist,
go fight the Spanish?

268
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:24,215
You and me in the war.

269
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:27,219
We got a lot of things going for us...

270
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:28,720
experience, maturity, leadership.

271
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:31,258
I'll bet we end up officers.

272
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,488
I'd be Major Parker.

273
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:37,192
Parker?

274
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,269
Yeah. That's my real name.

275
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:42,605
Robert Leroy Parker.

276
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,106
No fooling?

277
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:45,404
No.

278
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:51,143
Mine's Longbaugh.

279
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:52,821
No fooling.

280
00:20:53,056 --> 00:20:54,388
Long what?

281
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,423
Harry Longbaugh.

282
00:20:56,661 --> 00:20:58,425
So you'd be Major Longbaugh.

283
00:20:58,664 --> 00:20:59,858
What do you say?

284
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,302
You just keep thinking, Butch.

285
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,304
That's what you're good at.

286
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:09,806
<i>But you're not frightened.</i>

287
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:10,840
<i>No, sir.</i>

288
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,843
<i>You have got respect for me,</i>

289
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:15,312
<i>and I have got respect for you.</i>

290
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:18,317
That's why you and you and you

291
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:20,354
are riding with me. Am I right?

292
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:24,962
Well, what do you say?

293
00:21:25,198 --> 00:21:27,063
I say this.

294
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:31,032
I say, ladies and gentlemen,

295
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:33,365
boys and girls, friends and enemies,

296
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:34,870
meet the future!

297
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,372
The future what?

298
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:38,375
The future mode of transportation

299
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:40,640
for this weary Western world.

300
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:44,183
Now, I'm not going to make
a lot of extravagant claims.

301
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:47,153
Sure, it'll change your
whole life for the better,

302
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,654
but that's all.

303
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:51,192
What the hell do you think you're doing?

304
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:52,693
You got the crowd together,

305
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:55,197
so I thought I'd do a little selling.

306
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:57,701
I'm trying to raise a posse here.

307
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:59,201
A short presentation.

308
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:00,635
The horse is dead.

309
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:02,469
This item sells itself.

310
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:05,978
<i>Are you going to listen
to him or come with me?</i>

311
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:08,980
Butch, Fanny says to come into her party

312
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,016
right now.

313
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:13,521
<i>No oats, no mess, no kicks, no bites,</i>

314
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,023
<i>no running away, no
stepping on your foot.</i>

315
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:19,027
Well, I think I'll get saddled up

316
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,894
and go looking for a woman.

317
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,001
Good hunting.

318
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:29,237
Shouldn't take more
than a couple of days.

319
00:22:33,617 --> 00:22:34,914
I'm not picky...

320
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,384
as long as she's smart,

321
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,091
pretty...

322
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:41,657
sweet...

323
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,222
gentle, and...

324
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,560
tender and refined...

325
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:51,397
lovely...

326
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,106
carefree.

327
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,388
Aah!

328
00:24:01,328 --> 00:24:03,320
Keep going, teacher lady.

329
00:24:11,107 --> 00:24:13,667
It's O.K. Don't mind me. Keep on going.

330
00:24:41,345 --> 00:24:43,245
Let down your hair.

331
00:24:55,463 --> 00:24:56,954
Shake your head.

332
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,545
Do you know what I wish?

the concentration she deserves

Butch, you're really something,

00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:14,312
you know that?

507
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:16,879

You promised you'd never
come into my territory.

614

And we haven't.

615
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:51,151
Just because we were friendly

616
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,655
doesn't give you the right to break in.

Come on, Sundance.
Start trussing my feet.

636
00:47:49,531 --> 00:47:51,795
That's the point. Is that on tight?

637
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:52,796
That's all right.

638

I swear, this'd work, Ray.

641
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,938
You trust us. The government trusts you.

Anything you tell them
they gotta believe, right?

643

You've never done a
dishonest thing ever,

644
00:48:06,452 --> 00:48:08,215
and you're pushing 60. We'd quit.

645
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:10,218
They'd drop the charges against us,

646
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:12,221
we'd fight till the war is over.

647
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,690
They don't even have
to make us officers.

648
00:48:14,896 --> 00:48:15,989
That's some proposition.

649
00:48:16,265 --> 00:48:17,892
They forget all about the years

650
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,192
of thieving and robbing.

651
00:48:19,468 --> 00:48:21,061
They take you into the army,

652
00:48:21,304 --> 00:48:25,332
which is what you want
in the first place.

653
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:26,838
There's something out there

654
00:48:27,078 --> 00:48:29,070
that scares you, huh?

655
00:48:30,983 --> 00:48:32,246
But it's too late.

656
00:48:32,485 --> 00:48:34,248
You should've let yourself get killed

657
00:48:34,487 --> 00:48:36,217
while you had the chance.

658
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,756
You may be the biggest
thing to hit this area,

659
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:42,225
but you're still two-bit outlaws.

660
00:48:42,497 --> 00:48:45,763
I never met a soul more
affable than you, Butch,

661
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:47,231
or faster than the Kid.

662
00:48:47,504 --> 00:48:49,267
But you're still two-bit outlaws

663
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:50,269
on the dodge.

664
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:52,567
It's over! Don't you get that?

665
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:54,073
Your times is over,

666
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:56,076
and you're gonna die bloody,

667
00:48:56,315 --> 00:48:59,251

01:03:02,717 --> 01:03:04,481
A setup like that costs more

840
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,982
than we ever took.

841
01:03:06,188 --> 01:03:07,450
Apparently he can afford it.

842
01:03:10,193 --> 01:03:11,627
That crazy Harriman.

843
01:03:14,231 --> 01:03:15,494
That's bad business.

844
01:03:15,734 --> 01:03:16,928
How long do you think

845
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,430
I'd stay in operation

846
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,434
if every job cost me money?

847
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:22,938
If he'd just pay me what he's spending

848
01:03:23,176 --> 01:03:24,939
to make me stop robbing him,

849
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:26,440
I'd stop robbing him.

850
01:03:29,183 --> 01:03:31,948
You probably inherited
every penny you got!

851
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:32,949
Inherited guys,

852
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,952
what the hell do they know?

853
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:37,284
You say they were hired permanent?

854
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,325
No. Just till they kill you.

855
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,838
That means they're
still after us, Butch,

856
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,208
and it's going to be the same thing

857
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:56,678
all over again.

858
01:04:00,724 --> 01:04:02,487
They'll show up here...

859
01:04:02,726 --> 01:04:03,988
sooner or later.

860
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:15,939
[Butch and Sundance Talking]

861
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:21,945
Hey, Etta.

862
01:04:23,686 --> 01:04:25,449
I'll get you some more.

863
01:04:25,688 --> 01:04:28,954
Butch and me have been
talking it all over.

864
01:04:29,193 --> 01:04:30,956
Wherever the hell Bolivia is,

865
01:04:31,196 --> 01:04:32,959
that's where we're off to.

866
01:04:33,198 --> 01:04:35,463
We'll go down there and play it safe,

867
01:04:35,734 --> 01:04:37,998
maybe keep our hand in a little bit.

868
01:04:38,204 --> 01:04:39,467
Butch speaks some Spanish.

869
01:04:39,739 --> 01:04:42,003
I can wrestle with a menu O.K.

870
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:43,973
And you speak it good.

871
01:04:45,746 --> 01:04:49,012
And it'd be good cover
going with a woman.

872
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,982
No one expects it.

873
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,519
Then we could travel safer.

874
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,522
What I'm saying is,

875
01:04:57,762 --> 01:04:59,024
if you want to go,

876
01:04:59,264 --> 01:05:00,458
I won't stop you,

877
01:05:00,699 --> 01:05:02,463
but the minute you start to whine

878
01:05:02,702 --> 01:05:03,964
or make a nuisance,

879
01:05:04,203 --> 01:05:05,967
I don't care where we are,

880
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:07,468
I'm dumping you flat.

881
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:09,505
Don't sugarcoat it like that, Kid.

882
01:05:09,744 --> 01:05:11,006
Tell her straight.

883
01:05:16,753 --> 01:05:18,448
I'm 26, and I'm single

884
01:05:18,688 --> 01:05:19,950
and a schoolteacher,

885
01:05:20,157 --> 01:05:22,922
and that's the bottom of the pit.

886
01:05:23,194 --> 01:05:24,958
And the only excitement I've known

887
01:05:25,197 --> 01:05:26,459
is here with me now.

888
01:05:26,698 --> 01:05:27,961
So I'll go with you,

889
01:05:28,201 --> 01:05:29,463
and I won't whine,

890
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:30,964
and I'll sew your socks,

891
01:05:31,204 --> 01:05:33,469
and I'll stitch you when you're wounded,

892
01:05:33,707 --> 01:05:35,972
and I'll do anything you ask of me

893
01:05:36,211 --> 01:05:37,473
except one thing.

894
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:39,476
I won't watch you die.

895
01:05:39,749 --> 01:05:41,011
I'll miss that scene,

896
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:42,479
if you don't mind.

897
01:06:16,761 --> 01:06:17,956
The future's all yours,

898
01:06:18,164 --> 01:06:19,927
you lousy bicycles.

899
01:11:24,651 --> 01:11:27,415
Well, you know, it could be worse.

900
01:11:27,654 --> 01:11:31,113
You get a lot more for
your money in Bolivia.

901
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:32,622
I checked on it.

902
01:11:32,861 --> 01:11:34,123
What could they have here

903
01:11:34,363 --> 01:11:37,424
that you could possibly want to buy?

904
01:11:41,705 --> 01:11:43,970
Jeez, all Bolivia can't look like this.

905
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,608
How do you know?

906
01:11:45,877 --> 01:11:47,971
This might be the garden spot

907
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,442
of the whole country.

908
01:11:49,715 --> 01:11:51,479
People may travel hundreds of miles

909
01:11:51,718 --> 01:11:53,481
just to get to this spot

910
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,812
where we're standing now.

911
01:11:55,056 --> 01:11:56,819
This might be the
Atlantic City, New Jersey,

912
01:11:57,058 --> 01:11:58,822
of all Bolivia for all you know.

913
01:11:59,061 --> 01:12:00,323
I know more about Bolivia

914
01:12:00,462 --> 01:12:02,225
than you know about
Atlantic City, New Jersey,

915
01:12:02,464 --> 01:12:03,625
I can tell you that.

916
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,925
Aha!

917
01:12:06,169 --> 01:12:08,434
You do, huh?

918
01:12:08,673 --> 01:12:10,437
I was born there.

919
01:12:10,676 --> 01:12:12,940
I was born in New Jersey...

920
01:12:13,178 --> 01:12:14,976
brought up there, so...

921
01:12:15,214 --> 01:12:16,545
I didn't know that.

922
01:12:16,816 --> 01:12:18,978
The total tonnage of what you don't know

923
01:12:19,186 --> 01:12:20,448
is enough to shatter...

924
01:12:20,721 --> 01:12:21,711
We're not accomplishing

925
01:12:21,956 --> 01:12:22,980
as much as we might.

926
01:12:23,191 --> 01:12:25,456
Listen, your job is to back me up,

927
01:12:25,728 --> 01:12:27,252
because you'd starve without me.

928
01:12:28,898 --> 01:12:30,992
And you, your job is to shut up.

929
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,003
He'll feel a lot better

930
01:12:37,242 --> 01:12:39,506
after he's robbed a couple of banks.

931
01:12:40,914 --> 01:12:43,007
Ha ha ha ha!

932
01:12:45,252 --> 01:12:46,514
Bolivia.

933
01:12:56,266 --> 01:12:57,528
Hell, it's just a bank

934
01:12:57,801 --> 01:12:59,063
like any other bank.

935
01:12:59,269 --> 01:13:00,965
You got to move in slowly,

936
01:13:01,206 --> 01:13:02,468
check out everything.

937
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:04,004
The thing to remember...

938
01:13:04,243 --> 01:13:06,507
Don't tell me how to rob a bank.

939
01:13:06,746 --> 01:13:09,011
I know how to rob a bank.

940
01:13:09,249 --> 01:13:11,514
A few dark clouds
appear on your horizon,

941
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:14,517
and you just go all
to pieces, don't you?

942
01:13:34,214 --> 01:13:35,476
<i>Buenos días, señores.</i>

943
01:13:35,749 --> 01:13:37,080
<i>¿Les puedo servir en algo?</i>

944
01:13:37,284 --> 01:13:39,981
<i>Ordenen para atenderlos
por favor inmediatamente.</i>

945
01:13:42,258 --> 01:13:44,021
<i>¿ Quieren hacer algún depósito?</i>

946
01:13:46,263 --> 01:13:47,525
<i>¿ Quieren abrir una cuenta?</i>

947
01:13:47,764 --> 01:13:50,029
<i>Bien, el cajero los
atienda inmediatamente.</i>

948
01:13:50,268 --> 01:13:52,031
<i>Los atendemos por todo.</i>

949
01:13:58,278 --> 01:13:59,540
<i>Señor?</i>

950
01:14:11,027 --> 01:14:12,017
<i>Adiós.</i>

951
01:14:13,697 --> 01:14:15,495
This is a robbery.

952
01:14:15,767 --> 01:14:17,962
<i>Esto es un robo.</i>

953
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,968
<i>Esto es un robo.</i>

954
01:14:26,213 --> 01:14:28,478
This is supposed to
be a unison recitation.

955
01:14:28,749 --> 01:14:31,014
Why do I have to do any of this?

956
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,482
He's the one

957
01:14:32,754 --> 01:14:34,518
who claimed he knew the language.

958
01:14:34,757 --> 01:14:36,520
Your line of work requires
a specialized vocabulary.

959
01:14:36,759 --> 01:14:39,251
I got nervous. I forgot
the words. Shoot me.

960
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:41,363
You've had worse ideas lately.

961
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:42,999
Raise your hands.

962
01:14:44,769 --> 01:14:47,034
<i>Uh... las manos arriba.</i>

963
01:14:47,273 --> 01:14:48,535
Raise them.

964
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,539
<i>Arriba.</i>

965
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:54,543
All of you back against the wall.

966
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:59,049
<i>Todos ustedes, um...</i>

967
01:14:59,288 --> 01:15:02,486
<i>arrísmense a la pared.</i>

968
01:15:02,759 --> 01:15:04,522
Give me the money.

969
01:15:10,235 --> 01:15:12,727
Give me the money.

970
01:15:13,006 --> 01:15:15,031
Give me the money.

971
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:16,937
This is not going to work,

972
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:19,475
and we're going to be up all night

973
01:15:19,713 --> 01:15:20,976
until you get this.

974
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:22,979
Now give me the money.

975
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,987
It's on the tip of my tongue, Etta.

976
01:15:29,226 --> 01:15:30,488
I swear it.

977
01:15:32,764 --> 01:15:35,097
Butch, are you still thinking in there?

978
01:15:35,301 --> 01:15:38,099
What the hell else is there to do?

979
01:15:38,337 --> 01:15:40,499
Try this one.

980
01:15:40,774 --> 01:15:43,243
Where is the safe? Open it.

981
01:15:43,444 --> 01:15:45,002
<i>Dónde es...</i>

982
01:15:49,284 --> 01:15:51,549
Uh, that's a hard one.

983
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:56,782
<i>¿Dónde está la caja? ¡Ábrala!</i>

984
01:15:57,027 --> 01:15:59,622
That's very good, Butch.

985
01:15:59,864 --> 01:16:01,992
You're a good teacher. Etta.

986
01:16:03,803 --> 01:16:05,065
<i>¡Esto es un robo!</i>

987
01:16:11,179 --> 01:16:13,478
<i>Manos a...</i>

988
01:16:13,749 --> 01:16:15,478
<i>Manos, um...</i>

989
01:16:22,526 --> 01:16:24,221
<i>¡Manos arriba!</i>

990
01:16:24,463 --> 01:16:26,090
They got them up! Skip down!

991
01:16:26,365 --> 01:16:27,798
<i>- ¡Arriba!
- Skip on down!</i>

992
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:31,333
<i>Todos ustedes arrísmense a la pared.</i>

993
01:16:31,537 --> 01:16:33,438
They're against the wall already!

994
01:16:33,707 --> 01:16:34,469
<i>Dónde es...</i>

995
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:35,971
Oh, you're so damn smart,

996
01:16:36,211 --> 01:16:37,508
you read it.

997
01:16:46,423 --> 01:16:47,686
A goddamn crib sheet.

998
01:16:47,959 --> 01:16:49,221
You almost blew it.

999
01:16:49,427 --> 01:16:50,689
You sure didn't help much.

1000
01:16:50,963 --> 01:16:53,727
You can't do anything
without a crib sheet.

1001
01:17:09,285 --> 01:17:12,016
For God's sake, don't drop the money!

1002
01:17:12,256 --> 01:17:14,054
I won't drop the money!

1003
01:17:14,292 --> 01:17:15,520
<i>Voy a traer el comisario.</i>

1004
01:17:15,794 --> 01:17:16,852
<i>Sí, vamos.</i>

01:46:48,598 --> 01:46:50,362
I don't want to hear it.

1338
01:46:50,601 --> 01:46:51,863
You'll change your mind.

1339
01:46:52,102 --> 01:46:52,864
Shut up!

1340
01:46:53,104 --> 01:46:53,866
O.K., O.K.

1341
01:46:54,105 --> 01:46:55,367
Your ideas got us here.

1342
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:56,572
Forget it!

1343
01:46:56,775 --> 01:46:59,540
I never want to hear
another of your ideas.

1344
01:46:59,812 --> 01:47:00,574
All right.

1345
01:47:00,814 --> 01:47:01,508
O.K.

1346
01:47:11,193 --> 01:47:12,252
Australia.

1347
01:47:15,332 --> 01:47:18,029
I figured secretly you wanted to know,

1348
01:47:18,269 --> 01:47:19,531
so I told you.

1349
01:47:19,738 --> 01:47:20,705
Australia.

1350
01:47:22,607 --> 01:47:23,870
That's your great idea?

1351
01:47:24,143 --> 01:47:25,906
Oh, boy, it's the latest in...

1352
01:47:26,145 --> 01:47:27,408
in a long line.

1353
01:47:27,648 --> 01:47:29,411
Australia's no better than here.

1354
01:47:29,650 --> 01:47:30,912
Aw, that's all you know.

1355
01:47:31,152 --> 01:47:32,414
Name me one thing.

1356
01:47:32,654 --> 01:47:34,417
They speak English in Australia.

1357
01:47:34,656 --> 01:47:35,419
They do?

1358
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:36,920
That's right, smart guy.

1359
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:38,421
So we wouldn't be foreigners.

1360
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:41,292
They got horses in Australia.

1361
01:47:41,531 --> 01:47:44,797
They got thousands of
miles we could hide out in.

1362
01:47:45,036 --> 01:47:46,800
And a good climate, nice beaches.

1363
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:48,301
You could learn to swim.

1364
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:49,302
No!

1365
01:47:49,541 --> 01:47:50,941
Swimming isn't important.

1366
01:47:53,914 --> 01:47:56,405
What about the banks?

1367
01:47:56,650 --> 01:47:58,141
They're easy.

1368
01:47:58,420 --> 01:47:59,910
Easy, ripe, and luscious.

1369
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,724
The banks or the women?

1370
01:48:05,963 --> 01:48:08,727
Well, once you've got
one, you've got the other.

1371
01:48:11,636 --> 01:48:13,400
It's a long way, isn't it?

1372
01:48:13,639 --> 01:48:15,903
Aw! Everything's got
to be perfect with you.

1373
01:48:16,175 --> 01:48:17,871
I don't want to get there

1374
01:48:18,078 --> 01:48:19,340
and find out it stinks.

1375
01:48:19,579 --> 01:48:20,740
At least think about it.

1376
01:48:23,684 --> 01:48:24,709
All right.

1377
01:48:26,288 --> 01:48:27,550
I'll think about it.

1378
01:48:32,696 --> 01:48:33,458
Hey.

1379
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:37,031
When we get outside...

1380
01:48:37,269 --> 01:48:39,534
and we get to the horses,

1381
01:48:39,772 --> 01:48:41,034
just remember one thing.

1382
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:46,541
Hey, wait a minute.

1383
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:48,248
What?

1384
01:48:48,483 --> 01:48:51,248
You didn't see LeFors
out there, did you?

1385
01:48:51,487 --> 01:48:52,385
LeFors?

1386
01:48:53,722 --> 01:48:55,486
No.

1387
01:48:55,725 --> 01:48:57,693
Oh, good.

1388
01:48:57,928 --> 01:48:59,191
For a moment there,

1389
01:48:59,464 --> 01:49:01,659
I thought we were in trouble.
