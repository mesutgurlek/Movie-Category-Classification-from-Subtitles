        Hello, the house !

            It's Bud Searcy     
            and Elizabeth too.

You might know he'd land        
right at mealtime.

        Howdy, Miss Coates.     
        Howdy do.  Howdy, boy.  
        How's everybody ?

Hello, Mr. Searcy.              
            Slide down, child.  

308
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:41,888
Hello, Elizabeth.               
Just dropped over to see if     
there's any thing I could do.   

309
00:25:41,955 --> 00:25:45,758
    Travis, take this pony      
    to the corn crib and strip  
    the saddle gear off him.

Won't you come and set a while ?
Well, I believe I will shade up 
for a spell, Miss Coates.       

312
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:56,502
    Come on, Elizabeth.         
    Hot, ain't it ?

00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,806
We don't get some rain

gonna burn up bad.

Corn crop ain't gonna           
be worth nothin' more           
than a whirlwind nubbins.

Some folks'll be scrapin'

meal barrels come wintertime.

This here's                     
hanged too long.

Elizabeth, honey, run down      
to the spring and fetch your    
poor old pappy fresh water.     

318
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:19,776

It's a heavy responsibility     
ridin' herd on the settlement   
while the menfolks is gone.     

320
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:27,950
Wears a man                     
right down to a frazzle.        
But I ain't complainin', though.

321
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:31,087
I was chose for this job        
and I'll get her done.          

322
00:26:34,224 --> 00:26:38,060
I, uh, kinda figured            
to head up that cow drive       
to Kansas myself.               

323
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:40,430
But when man after man called me
all spoke private like...       

324
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:44,301
Beggin' me to stay,             
look after you womenfolks and   
the young ones, I seen my duty. 

325
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:47,771
Knowed I was bein' called on    
for a bigger job.               

326
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:50,006
    Jim said you were gonna     
    protect us all.             

327
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:52,509
    Mighty lucky thing too.     
    Know what happened          
    the other day ?             

328
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:56,680
That fool kid of Jed Simpson's  
shot at a bunch of hogs         
and wounded one of 'em.         

329
00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:59,549
Set it to squealin'.            
Ha !  Be dogged the rest of them
didn't tree that boy.           

330
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,985
Kept him up there               
till I happened along and       
see'd what a pickle he was in.  

331
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:06,889
    Of course I couldn't chase  
    those pesky javelinas off.  

332
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:10,927
But I did go tell               
that boy's Mama where he was,   
so she could rest easy...       

333
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:15,064
Till the varmints left out      
and give him a chance           
to climb down.                  

334
00:27:16,734 --> 00:27:20,169
Yep.  Lookin' out               
after you womenfolks...         

335
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:23,139
And the young ones              
sure keeps a man                
a-hoppin' around.               

336
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:28,745
Biggest bother I've had, though,
lately is the thievin' what's   
been goin' on at salt licks.

that's all right, Miss Coates.

to know when it's time to eat.

    on toward dinnertime.

00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:05,182
Travis, will you go down        
to the corn patch and pick us   
some roastin' ears ?            

347
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:08,985
    Now, just a minute,         
    Miss Coates.  That boy need 
    help to tote all that corn.

with Travis.

00:28:16,243 --> 00:28:19,596
    Be sure you pick out ears

he can't do it ?

        How come ?              

366
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,797

    to get shot for stealin'.   

369
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:45,131
Just an old arrowhead

00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,050
    Kill him ?                  
    Why, it killed him

up a tree.  Heap safer that way.

    as a whistle, boy.

    but out of hog reach.

            like that.          

897
01:20:25,451 --> 01:20:27,486
            A lot of it's       
            mighty fine.        

898
01:20:27,554 --> 01:20:32,340
        And you can't afford    
        to waste the good part  
        frettin' about the bad. 

899
01:20:32,408 --> 01:20:35,844
                That makes it   
                all bad.        

900
01:20:35,912 --> 01:20:40,315
        You understand what     
        I'm trying to get at ?  
    Yes, sir.                   

901
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:42,884
        It's just that--        

902
01:20:42,952 --> 01:20:45,654
                Yeah, sure,     
                I know.         

903
01:20:47,089 --> 01:20:51,159
    Sayin' it's one thing       
    and feelin' it's another.   

904
01:20:51,227 --> 01:20:55,313
    But I'll tell you a trick   
    that's sometimes a big help.

905
01:20:55,381 --> 01:20:57,315
        You start lookin' around
        for somethin' good...   

906
01:20:57,383 --> 01:20:59,517
            To take the place   
            of the bad.         

907
01:20:59,585 --> 01:21:02,353
            As a general rule,  
            you can find it.    

908
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:13,582
        Brought you that horse  
        I promised.             
Yes, sir.                       

909
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:17,385
    I reckon you                
    ain't in no shape           
    to take pleasure in him yet.

910
01:21:17,453 --> 01:21:19,387
No, sir.                        

911
01:21:19,455 --> 01:21:21,456
            We'll just keep him 
            a while.            

912
01:21:21,524 --> 01:21:24,058
        Maybe you'll come to    
        feel different later on.

913
01:21:24,126 --> 01:21:26,227
    Your Mama was fixin' supper 
    when I left the house.      

914
01:21:26,295 --> 01:21:29,865
        Might hurt her feelings 
        if we're not there      
        on time to eat it.

01:22:03,149 --> 01:22:06,134

                to kill my dog. 

924
01:22:10,856 --> 01:22:13,292
I never even touched him.       
        Of course, she didn't.
