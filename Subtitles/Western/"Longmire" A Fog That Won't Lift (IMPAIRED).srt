- Aah!
- Dad, Dad, it's me.

It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me.

I'm on your side.

Oh, my God.

13
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,528
Oh, my God, what happened?

14
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,737
Where is she?

15
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,739
- Oh, my God.
- Where is she, Cady?

16
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,408
I got to stop the bleeding, okay?

17
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,744
Shh, shh, don't speak.
Just stay right there.

18
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:17,870
Don't move, don't move.

19
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:25,961
I'm right here.

20
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,128
[Walt] Where is she?

00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:28,797
Where is she, Cady?

22
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,643
Dad, I'm right here.
I'm right here, okay?

23
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,176
[Walt] Cady, I... Cady.

24
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,511
- Cady.
- Stay with me.

25
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,807
- Cady.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,516
- Yeah.
- Where is she?

27
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:41,935
Where is she?

28
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:43,937
She's dead, Dad.

29
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:45,939
Mom's dead.

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,523
She's gone.

00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:49,693
But I'm right here.

00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:50,903
- Cady.
- I'm right here.

33
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,167
I'm right here,
and you're gonna be fine.

34
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,657
Okay? Stay here.

35
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:57,659
Stay with me.

Please wake up! Don't leave me!

Sit down, Standing Bear.

00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:50,504
I would rather stand.

Yeah, I would, too,
if I had a bullet in my ass.

.30-caliber bullet
from Walt Longmire's rifle.

He fired at the man he
thought was Hector.

Bullet hit this rock and ricocheted
into your butt as you ran away.

You dripped blood under these leaves.

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,485
Same blood I found soaking
the seat of your truck.

53
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:15,695
Which was stolen.

54
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,448
No, it just wasn't
where you had stashed it

55
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,701
after it broke down,
'cause I found it.

00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,912
I fixed your punctured fuel line,
by the way.

If you were so certain
you had me dead to rights,

why am I not in jail?

59
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,085
Oh, jail's still on the table...

60

for the assault and
murder of Tyler Malone.

You can work for me.

[cellphone ringing]

Don't answer.

68
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,068
She will wonder why I am not picking up.

69
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,528
And you'll lie to her.

70
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,405
You've gotten pretty good at that.

71

Even if I did what you say,

00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,208
you have no authority
to prosecute felonies,

I got, uh...

101
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,567
And if you say you got shot,
I am gonna punch you.

102
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,535
Beyond that, I... don't know.

103
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,332
The bullet went through
and through, Dad.

104
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,656
But it only hit soft tissue,
so there's minimal damage.

105
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,670
They say you took a pretty
hard blow to the head.

106

Five stitches.

I don't know.

Were you... were you asleep?

No.

What were you doing?

113
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,407
I was... I was with someone.

114
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,536
Donna was there?

115
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,081
Who's... who's Donna?

116
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,959
[Walt] D-Donna's, um...

117
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,460
She's his girlfriend.

No, I don't think so.

121
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,560
You haven't found Donna?

122
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,896
Walt, we didn't know we were supposed
to be looking for her, okay?

123
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,441
How long have I been here?

124
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,069
13 hours.

125
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,113
Then he's still here.

00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,032
- Who's still here?
- Walker Browning.

127

You're gonna lay down. Dad, Dad.

128

Stop it.

129
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,330
- Stop it.
- Shit.

130
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,789
- Come on.
- Nurse!

131
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,166
Walt! Hey.

00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,333
Help, Nurse!

133
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,709
Dad.

134
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,710
Sit down.

135
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,046
- Dad.
- Come on.

136
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,880
Dad, where are you going?

137
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,090
Room 119.

138
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,342
- Dad, stop it.
- Yeah, Ferg.

139
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,843
Dr. Donna Monaghan.

140
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,847
Yes, the psychiatrist.
You need to find her.

141
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,233
Walt, why do you think
that Walker is here?

142
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,386
I handcuffed him to the bed.

143
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,188
Walker.

144
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,110
Uh, no. My name's Ruth.

145
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,406
He was right here.

146
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,325
Room 119.

147
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,784
Would you like to sit down?

148
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,661
You don't look well.

149
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,620
Sorry.

150
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,791
Where's Walker Browning?
He's supposed to be in that room.

151
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,709
He was released yesterday afternoon.

152
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,545
- Who released him?
- The sheriff.

153
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,214
This is the sheriff.

154
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,716
This is Sheriff Wilkins?

155
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,219
[Cady] Dad, stop. You can barely walk.

156
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,930
As long as I can do that,
I have to find her.

157
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,153
If Walker was released
yesterday afternoon,

158
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,628
would that have given him
enough time to get to your cabin?

159
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:25,070
Sure.

160
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,026
[grunts]

161
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,240
Come on.

[grunts]

163
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,452
So, what time were you attacked?

164
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,120
I wasn't wearing a watch.

165
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:41,664
[exhales deeply]

166
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,790
No, I know, I'm just...

167
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,269
I'm just trying to make sense
of the timeline is all, you know?

168
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,172
Walker had a lot to do in...

169
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,299
not a lot of time.

170
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,177
Damn it.

171
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,263
[grunts]

172
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,853
[grunting]

173
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,313
Okay, this is ridiculous.

174
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,503
- No, I got it.
- No, you don't. Here.

175
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:09,859
- I got it, Vic.
- It's fine.

176
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,944
Here, hold on. Just give me your foot.

177
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,281
Give me your foot.

178
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,573
Okay.

179
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,700
Okay.
All right.

180
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,993
Here.

181
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:19,994
Thanks.

182
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,332
Maybe you should stop
flattering yourself.

183
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,334
Maybe this isn't all
about you, you know?

184
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,046
What? Me getting shot in my house?

185
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,464
Yeah.

186
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,424
And Dr. Monaghan disappearing.

187
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,097
Maybe this is all about her,
and you're the collateral damage.

188
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,599
Think about it, Walt.

189
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,404
One of her patients attempts suicide
and then sets her van on fire?

190
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,441
Stopped at the hospital.
Why aren't you there?

191
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,235
Because he refuses to listen
to anyone who cares about him.

192
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,279
Any sign of Donna, Ferg?

193
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:56,573
Uh, no answer on her home phone.

194
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,451
She wasn't scheduled to work today.

195
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,619
I asked the Sheridan P.D.
to stop by her house.

196
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,037
My boots.

197
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,331
[grunts]

198
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,083
Um...

199
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,752
Also, Doc Weston told
me to give you these.

200
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,097
[straining] Put out an APB on Donna.

201
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:26,143
Have Ruby call every
hospital in the state.

202
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,396
[exhales deeply]

203
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:34,902
[breathing heavily]

204
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,946
I don't think I can be any more clear.

205
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,534
Is there a reason you're
not doing what I asked?

206
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,578
Actually, yeah.

207
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,913
I think somebody should
be looking for Zach.

208
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,457
When was the last time you saw him?

209
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,874
When I fired him.

210
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,002
Why?

211
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,879
Well, the last time I saw him,

212
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,424
he'd started drinking again
and he was in a pretty dark place.

213
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:00,970
Oh, come on. You think that Zach shot
Walt and kidnapped Dr. Monaghan?

214
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,013
My belt.

215
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:04,682
What do you think, Walt?

216
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,982
Well... I don't know.

217
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,738
I don't remember the actual...
actual event.

218
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,422
- Well, then you don't know...
- I don't!

219
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,241
Okay?!

220
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,659
I don't remember!

221
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,123
I don't know if it was...
it was Walker Browning or...

222
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,919
one of Donna's patients,
or the guy I just fired.

223
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,463
I don't know.

224
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,522
Then let's go see if we can't
clear some things up, okay?

225
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,773
- Yep.
- Okay.

226
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,281
[door opens]

227
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,684
Did you hear him break in?

228
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,269
Maybe.

229
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,275
So, they kicked through the front door.

230
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,653
You got shot there?

231
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,327
Or is that where Cady found you?

232
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,413
Uh...

233
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,420
I guess, uh, the shooter
must've hit me in my room

234
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,338
and I crawled out here.

235
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,802
You got shot through the door?

236
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,429
I guess so.

237
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,849
So it's not that you can't
remember who shot you.

238
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,018
You didn't even see him?

239
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,772
[high-pitched ringing]

240
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,734
This must be where you
were when you got hit.

241
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,402
I'll see if I can find the slugs.

242
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,086
[sighs]

243
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,256
Found one.

244
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,342
Hey, Ferg, you got an evidence bag?

245
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,511
Yeah.

246
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,479
What'd you find?

247
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,609
Evidence.

248
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,618
All right.

249
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,079
I'm gonna go see what
kind of slugs these are.

250
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,204
.30 caliber.

251
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,583
My rifle's gone.

252
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,629
I was shot with my own rifle.

253
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,130
[sighs]

254
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:29,345
Bet that's what he used to smash me
in the back of the head, too, so...

255
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,305
[Ferg] Walt.

256
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,934
We got two bullet holes, we got two
slugs, and we got one blood spot,

257
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,853
so at least we know that Dr.
Monaghan didn't get shot.

258
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,814
[Vic] Hey, Walt.

259
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,651
I know you said that you didn't hear
a car approach your cabin,

260
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,094
but isn't it possible that one
did and you didn't hear him

261
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:46,537
because...

262
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,657
I don't want to get too personal, but...

263
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,995
Walker didn't drive here.

264
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,830
We don't know it was Walker.

265
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,499
- He drove away.
- In a getaway car?

266
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,628
Sort of.

267
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,712
He took my Bronco.

268
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,014
So, he shoots you... but not Donna.

269
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,646
And he drives off in your
truck with her in tow.

270
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,295
This is really starting to seem
like she was the target, Walt.

271
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,365
Who else knew that she was out here?

272
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,163
Just you and me.

273
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,342
That's why I don't think
this is about her.

274
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,878
Somebody tried to hurt me.

275
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,761
[sighs]

276
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,100
[door slams]

277
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,366
So, what now?

278
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,412
Check and see if anybody's
responded to the APB.

279
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:22,458
And try and track the Bronco,
figure out which way they went.

280
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,044
And I have to make a little trip.

281
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,845
[indistinct shouting]

282
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,309
[Man] Come on, hustle!

283
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,727
All right!

284
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,131
[Man #2] Come on, now! Let's go!

285
00:17:43,155 --> 00:17:44,479
[Man] Batter up!

286
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,482
- You see him?
- He's right there.

287
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,524
[Walt] Hey, Jim.

288
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:53,197
You know, Walt, sometimes I wonder
who's looking after your county

289
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,990
when you're over here in mine.

290
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,910
Where's Walker Browning? I know you
released him from the hospital.

291
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,955
This is not really a
good time right now.

292
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,358
I'm gonna sing the national
anthem here in just a minute.

293
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,751
- You let a criminal go.
- Did I?

294
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,836
What crime did he commit, anyways?

295
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,559
From what I understand, you guys
didn't charge him with anything.

296
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,673
- He was trying to murder Gab Langton.
- Well, that's not the story I heard.

297
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,885
And what story did you hear?

298
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,803
Well, the story I heard
is about a sheriff

299
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,806
with a bug up his ass
about an oil company

300
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:21,434
trying to pin a rape and murder case
on a couple decent oil workers.

301
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,185
When he couldn't make that stick,

302
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,429
then he stalks them into the
woods and ambushed them.

303
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,440
That's a lie. Walker and Trot
Simic were trying to kill Gab.

304
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,360
- They'd have killed me, too, if I...
- Yeah, if you hadn't shot first.

305
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,738
You really think I'd
lie about this, Jim?

306
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,946
I think you've been under a lot of
pressure these last couple months, Walt.

307
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,827
I think it's clouded your judgment.

308
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,203
He did this to me.

309
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:44,290
He shot me, and he abducted this woman.

310
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,250
Now I need to find her.

311
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:50,129
I know you got a blind spot where
the oil companies are concerned, Jim.

312
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,090
But I never thought you'd go this far.

313
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,591
God damn it, Walt.

314
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,970
Your self-righteous habit of
accusing people without any evidence

315
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,641
is gonna get you into a shitload
of trouble someday, and soon.

316
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:04,644
Like the next time you come into my
county without a proper warrant.

317
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,066
[gate closes]

318
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:22,244
[piano playing]

319
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,926
[playing continues]

320
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,057
[sighs]

321
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:48,688
When we get to the Newett oil field,
you keep the work site office occupied.

322
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,315
I'll take a look around for Walker.

323
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,528
Vic, where are you going?

324
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,404
Do you really think

325
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:01,034
that Walker Browning
is gonna escape captivity, shoot you,

326
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,285
and then head back to work?

327
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,330
- He's gone, Walt.
- So where are we going?

328
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,457
We're expanding our search
for Dr. Monaghan

329
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,003
to include people who actually had
something to do with Dr. Monaghan.

330
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,006
Jesus, Walt, we both saw that smoldering
van after one of her patients torched it.

331
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,985
The least we could do is try and
figure out who that patient is

332
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,136
and get an address for him.

333
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,016
- Fine.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

334
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,936
Did I give you the impression
that I was asking permission?

335
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,187
Because I wasn't.

336
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,606
[cellphone rings]

337
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,150
[cellphone beeps]

338
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,442
Yeah, Ferg?

339
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,944
I found Walt's Bronco.

340
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,696
I'm right here, Ferg.

341
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,032
<i>Where's my truck?</i>

342
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,743
It's about a quarter
mile from your cabin.

343
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:27,954
The keys are still in it.

344
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,496
What about my rifle?

345
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,166
No. No sign of it.

346
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,254
But it looks like there was
another car parked here.

347
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,423
I'm thinking the shooter stashed his car

348
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,467
<i>and snuck up to your place on foot.</i>

349
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,764
Hey, Ferg, is there any sign
that Donna was in the Bronco?

350
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,765
<i>Nothing obvious.</i>

351
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,978
I'll have it towed to the print shed
so I can take a more thorough look.

352
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,021
At least there isn't any blood.

353
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,232
<i>That's a good sign.</i>

354
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,368
[grunts]

355
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,330
We need to see Dr.
Monaghan's patient files.

356
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,417
You know we can't do that.
We've got HIPAA restrictions.

357
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,128
We understand that doctor-patient
privilege normally applies,

358
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,005
but Dr. Monaghan is missing.

359
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,259
- Have you heard from her?
- We weren't expecting her today.

360
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,625
We think that she was abducted
by one of her patients.

361
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:28,110
- This is important.
- And so is the privacy of our patients.

362
00:22:28,134 --> 00:22:30,021
Look, if you're telling the truth,

363
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,477
you won't have any trouble getting
a judge to write you a limited warrant.

364
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,354
- We don't have time for that.
- [chuckles]

365
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,941
You had time to drive all the
way over from another county.

366
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,068
And what does that mean?

367
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,944
If Donna really was missing,

368
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,738
I would expect to see
the Sheridan police.

369
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:48,367
Really? Okay. 'Cause she
disappeared in our county

370
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,704
two days after her car was firebombed
in our county, so, you know.

371
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,790
- Oh!
- Call an ambulance!

372
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,793
Walt!
Come on!

373
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,754
What are you... what
are you waiting for?!

374
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,465
- It's... it's dead.
- Well, then go find another one!

375
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,927
Walt? Walt?

376
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,387
Are you okay? Walt!

377
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,099
[door closes]
You are a genius.

378
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,558
[grunting]

379
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,230
Walt.

380
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,773
Hey.

381
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:20,732
Come on.

382
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,858
Give me a hand.

383
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,780
Walt, come on, man.
There's, like, tons of files.

384
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:30,825
Walt! You know, I could use
a little help over here.

385
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,369
Walt!

386
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,538
Walt?

387
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,415
Walt, wake up.

388
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,001
Walt, are you okay?

389
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,543
Are you okay?

390
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,840
You're not gonna kiss me again, are you?

391
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,258
[sighs]

392
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:49,220
The paramedics are on their way.

393
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,306
No, no. No, that's, uh...

394
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,808
- Okay.
- That's not necessary.

395
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,352
I'm, uh... I'm fine.

396
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,104
Really.

397
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,691
I'm fine.

398
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,068
Thank you.

399
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,699
We're gonna come back with
a warrant, ma'am, okay?

400
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,541
I'm taking you to the hospital.

401
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,672
I'm fine.

402
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,592
No, you're obviously not fine.
You passed out.

403
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,716
A few minutes ago,
you thought that was brilliant.

404
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,764
A few minutes ago,
I thought you were faking it.

405
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,391
I just need something to eat.

406
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,517
- Did you take the pills?
- They make me drowsy.

407
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,978
I can't go to sleep.
I have to find Donna.

408
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,064
- Walt.
- Just take me to the arson inve...

409
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,255
Happy?

410
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,798
Ecstatic.

411
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,516
Did you?

412
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,767
[tires screech]

413
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,977
Damn it, Walt!
Seriously?

414
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,190
You know, I know that this isn't
a normal missing person for you

415
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:28,652
and that you care about her
or love her or whatever.

416
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:34,783
And maybe I don't care about
her as much as you do,

417
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,494
but I care about you, okay?

418
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,006
And don't, okay?

419
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,675
I'm not jealous.

420
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,218
That kiss...

421
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,428
Vic.

422
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,096
It wasn't me making a move, okay?

423
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,058
It was me... moving on.

424
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,685
All right?

425
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,020
And if you really, really
want to help Donna,

426
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:05,865
you're gonna have to
take care of yourself,

427
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,108
and if that means being drowsy,
then so be it.

428
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,068
Okay?

429
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,653
Now open your mouth.

430
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,904
Vic.

431
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,573
Open your damn mouth.

432
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,161
Swallow.

433
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,506
Show me.

434
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,552
Tongue.

435
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,806
You are like a frickin' four-year-old.

436
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,727
Ow.

437
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,455
[knock on door]

438
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,872
It is open.

439
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,415
[door opens]

440
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:07,251
[Vic] Okay, watch your step.

441
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,383
Walt, what are you doing here?

442
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,551
- He said he called you.
- He lied.

443
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,845
I meant to call.

444
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,974
His house is a crime scene.
He can't sleep there.

445
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,143
You should be at the hospital.

446
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,561
I was.

447
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,980
Not when I stopped by.

448
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,776
He checked himself out
because he's invincible.

449
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,238
So, can he stay?

450
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,084
I got to get back to work and start
going over some patient files.

451
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,367
- Of course.
- I'm going with you, Vic.

452
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,786
Go. I will keep him restrained.

453
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,703
Thank you.

454
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,921
So, the last time you were here, I drew
you a map to the Crow Reservation.

455
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,385
Is that what got you shot?

456
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,803
I think so.

457
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,971
I ran into Walker Browning out there.

458
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,642
How did he know where to find Gab?

459
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,186
I don't know.

460
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,023
Did he get her? Is she okay?

461
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,692
She's fine.

462
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,279
She got away.

463
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:19,240
But...
[groans]

464
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,117
...Trot Simic is dead.

465
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,369
Shot.

466
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,912
Who shot him?

467
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,914
I don't know.

468
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,166
I thought I had him, Henry.

469
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,752
[moans]

470
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:32,919
Trot?

471
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,838
Uh, no.

472
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,007
Walker.

473
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,592
He got away, too.

474
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,555
And now he's got Donna.

475
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,097
Who is Donna?

476
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:50,313
She's a... psychiatrist.

477
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,984
[sighs]

478
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,656
Well...

479
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,573
[grunts]

480
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,952
...I have been busy, too.

481
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,082
I will tell you about it
some other time.

482
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,479
Hey, Ferg, what did you do
with the prescription records?

483
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:36,900
Uh, they're, um... right next
to the, uh, bipolar cases.

484
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,110
Okay.

485
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,280
[sighs]

486
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:44,199
Vic.

487
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:49,329
- Yeah?
- I found a blonde hair in Walt's Bronco.

488
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,506
Yeah, no, I mean, we sort of figured
that she was in the Bronco, so...

489
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,919
It was in the way back.

490
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,467
Shit.

491
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,473
Uh...

492
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,560
Could be mine.

493
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,228
I was back there with Tyler Malone.

494
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,105
Should I tell Walt about it?

495
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,191
No. No, don't.

496
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,778
Um... he doesn't need the extra stress.

497
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,448
Um...

498
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,828
Find a lab, run it against mine.

499
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,415
And if it's a match,

500
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:37,252
then there's no need to worry him, okay?

501
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,132
[door opens]

502
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,468
- [Walt] What do you got there, Ferg?
- What?

503
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,927
Nothing.

504
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,223
How did you sleep?

505
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,184
Lot better than you two, looks like.

506
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,727
- So, uh...
- Here.

507
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,269
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

508
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,649
Anybody got a line on Walker
Browning's whereabouts?

509
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,696
No. We've been going through Dr.
Monaghan's patient files and notebooks

510
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,780
trying to find that patient that she
mentioned after her van got torched.

511
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,740
We found a few suicide attempts

512
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,343
and a bunch more that Dr. Monaghan
seemed to be worried about.

513
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:13,038
We're focusing on patients
that live in Absaroka

514
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,915
since that's the hospital they went to.

515
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,376
Yeah, but, unfortunately,
we can't, uh, check them

516
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,879
against the date that you saw Donna
at the hospital visiting her patient.

517
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,005
Why not?

518
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:24,758
'Cause I didn't get them.

519
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,885
We're missing the last three weeks.

520
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,054
And they're the ones we need.

521
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:33,224
Sure, yeah, but we, um... we still have
a really good suspect list.

522
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:37,896
Um, Kyle McCormick, Duncan Butler,
Tamar Smith, Jesse Cruz.

523
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,689
I say we split up and go interview them.

524
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,483
[Walt sighs]

525
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,611
The arson investigation
turn anything up?

526
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,405
As of two hours ago, nothing.

527
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,407
[door opens]
Check again.

528
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,330
We got to make sure
we got our ducks in a row

529
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,536
before we start running
down Donna's patients.

530
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,871
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Punk.

531
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,459
Is that what all this is?
These are Donna's patient files?

532
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,795
Not all of them.
We're missing the last few weeks.

533
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,084
Please tell me you got these
from a Special Master.

534
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,550
What's that?

535
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:10,971
Uh, the guy that the judge
would normally appoint

536
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,140
to, uh, decide which
files we can look at.

537
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,101
Normally. Yeah.

538
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,436
So, not in this case.

539
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,273
Okay, I guess you'll just have to claim
that you're not in your right mind.

540
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,525
Yeah, he's not.

541
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,986
You know, under the circumstances,

542
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,572
I'll pay whatever fines they impose.

543
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,323
"Fines"?

544
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,659
Dad, you have a major
civil suit pending.

545
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,539
If they find out that you're
illegally seizing files...

546
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,874
Cady, they don't even
know that these are gone.

547
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,417
Good. Then you can give them back,

548
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,795
and you can get a judge
to appoint a Special Master.

549
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,047
Then what? Wait?

550
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,716
Donna's missing.

551
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:50,177
You know, once I found myself
in similar circumstances,

552
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,889
and someone once told me that I could get
the same information a different way.

553
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:54,931
A legal way.

554
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,725
Hey.

555
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,849
Walt, we haven't been
to Dr. Monaghan's house yet.

556
00:32:58,873 --> 00:33:01,250
You know,
maybe the missing files are there.

557
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,693
Okay, Ferg, um, go to the hospital,

558
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,570
see if you can convince
someone to give you

559
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,989
the name of that suicidal patient
that Dr. Monaghan visited last week.

560
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:12,282
Vic, we'll go to Donna's.

561
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,374
Was there something else?

562
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,754
Well...

563
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,421
Not really.

564
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,841
No, I was just checking
to see if you were okay.

565
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,718
What happened to your eye?

566
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,935
I was, uh... it was an accident.

567
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,436
I'm fine.

568
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,396
Good. So am I.

569
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,653
[door closes]

570
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,331
[handle rattles]

571
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,544
[sighs]

572
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,296
Doesn't anybody lock their
doors in this state?

573
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,634
Huh.

574
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,469
What?

575
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,807
Nothing. It's just not what
I expected from Donna.

576
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,474
You been here before?

577
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,561
Once.

578
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:28,692
I brought her by after the van
fire to pick up some things.

579
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,028
How long's she lived here?

580
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,696
I'm not sure.

581
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:38,534
This is a really nice place
for someone working at a V.A. clinic.

582
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,704
Where'd she get her money?

583
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,664
I don't know.

584
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,006
How well do you really know Donna, Walt?

585
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,220
These look like the ones
you found in her office.

586
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,143
[door creaks]

587
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,568
[Vic] It's clear.

588
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,823
[grunts]

589
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,284
[Walt] Hey!

590
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,787
Hey!

591
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:06,039
- Okay, Vic?
- Yeah.

592
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,581
Get up!
Come on.

593
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,327
- Who the hell are you?
- I could ask you the same thing.

594
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,550
I'm the sheriff. Let me see some I.D.

595
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,760
Look, I don't have any.

596
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,095
You don't have a wallet?

597
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,472
- Go ahead.
- Easy.

598
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,307
You can pat me down.

599
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,605
Nothing.

600
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:34,901
What are you doing here?

601
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,445
Visiting my mom.

602
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,033
I didn't know that Donna had a son.

603
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:44,953
Neither did I.

604
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,046
Hi, there. Sorry to bother you.

605
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,672
Uh, my name is Deputy Ferguson

606
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:58,678
with the Absaroka County
Sheriff's Department.

607
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,260
That explains the outfit.

608
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,428
Right.

609
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,849
Uh, anyway,
I'm one of the lead investigators

610
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,683
on a missing-persons case.

611
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:09,852
I'm really hoping you can
help me with something.

612
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:11,127
I.D.?

613
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,357
Okay.

614
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:24,201
Now, our missing person interacted
with someone here a few days ago.

615
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,703
A patient who had recently
attempted suicide.

616
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:28,956
I'm hoping you can tell me...

617
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:30,540
- Can't.
- No?

618
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,384
I mean,
I think if you'll let me explain...

619
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,003
Then I would just be
wasting both of our time.

620
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,256
Look,
this was one of Dr. Monaghan's patients,

621
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,050
and Dr. Monaghan is our
missing person, so...

622
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,554
So take it up with someone
in administration.

623
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,305
The doctor can be in real danger.

624
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,433
Above my pay grade, Detective Ferguson.

625
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,648
[sighs]

626
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,154
Hey, listen.

627
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,365
I don't know what you've
been telling everybody,

628
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,611
- but I never met you before in my life.
- Excuse me?

629
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,494
So, stop going around telling people

630
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,872
that I'm the one that gave
you the name Tamar Smith.

631
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,438
I'm sorry. I think you have me
confused with somebody else.

632
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:16,133
Right, because I'm not the one who gave
you the name of Dr. Monaghan's patient.

633
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,881
I don't know how you got it.

634
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,466
Tamar Smith?

635
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,858
[sighs]

636
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,818
[door opens]

637
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:45,115
It took you guys that
long to Google a name?

638
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:48,911
That's not how we do it, Andy.

639
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:50,578
It's Andrew.

640
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,707
Right. Andrew Price.

641
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,586
We're still waiting on the San
Francisco P.D. to confirm that.

642
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,881
[scoffs]
They sending it via the Pony Express?

643
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,548
Well, it'd be a lot quicker

644
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,509
if you hadn't left your
wallet in California.

645
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,678
Look, man, I'm telling you,
Donna Monaghan is my mother.

646
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,264
Can't you just call her?

647
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,474
Why don't you have the
same last name, Andrew?

648
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,227
I kept my father's name.

649
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,938
Well, if you're her
son, why did you run?

650
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,858
'Cause I thought you were someone else.

651
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,445
[sighs]

652
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,238
I'm in a little financial trouble,

653
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,033
and not all my investors
are very patient.

654
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,492
What kind of financial trouble?

655
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,078
The kind where you don't have the money.

656
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:37,876
Look, starting a nightclub isn't easy,
and financing is, well, creative.

657
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:40,837
Right. Like stealing
from your supposed mother

658
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:41,964
when she's not around.

659
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,840
Uh, what's that quote?

660
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:46,284
Family are the ones who,
when you have nowhere left to go,

661
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,760
they have to take you in.

662
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,183
Robert Frost.

663
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:56,978
Uh, actually, it's home, not family.

664
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,649
Either way, Donna never mentioned you.

665
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,153
Oh, I get it now.

666
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,654
You're screwing her.

667
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,697
Funny. I mean, you're
not really her type.

668
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,700
She does like to mix it up, though.

669
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,954
Unpredictability has led her
to be attracted to all sorts of guys.

670
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,957
Oh, I'm real sorry.
You're... you're not the first.

671
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,833
But I'd be careful, though.

672
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,128
My pops is still all
messed up about her.

673
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,381
When'd you see your mother last?

674
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,134
Uh, we rang in the New Year together,
actually.

675
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,261
She gave me a list of resolutions,

676
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:34,307
a list of ways I could be a more
successful, more miserable person.

677
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,517
She calls it being a realist.

678
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,394
I say it's her being a bitch.

679
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,438
Well, you seem angry with her.

680
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,441
You think I'm exaggerating.

681
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,484
You just wait.

682
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,320
Donna's missing.

683
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,573
Like I said, she does what she
wants whenever she wants.

684
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,992
Not this time.

685
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:53,576
She's been abducted.

686
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,871
Well, if I were you,
I'd check the previous guy.

687
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,748
- What previous guy?
- I don't know, man.

688
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,962
But there's always a previous boyfriend.
She does tend to overlap.

689
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,005
Not everyone takes too kindly to that.

690
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,343
[knock on door, door opens]

691
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,552
- [Ferg] Sheriff.
- Yeah?

692
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,475
Ferg.

693
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,478
Lock him up and see if
anything he's saying is true.

694
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:25,817
And I need you to look into
Donna's ex-husband, any other, um...

695
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,361
- Boyfriends?
- Uh-huh.

696
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,363
- Do you have something else?
- Yeah.

697
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,991
I got the name of Donna's
suicidal patient.

698
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,179
Good afternoon, sir.

699
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,389
Ma'am.

700
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,973
Are you Tamar Smith?

701
00:41:58,058 --> 00:41:59,309
Yes, sir.

702
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,311
- Did I do something wrong, sir?
- No.

703
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,980
No, we just need to ask you
a few questions, Tamar.

704
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,816
About what?

705
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:10,444
About Dr. Monaghan. She's missing.

706
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,573
We're talking to the last people
who might've seen her.

707
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,077
How do you know that I even know her?

708
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,496
The V.A. clinic felt compelled
to give us a list of her patients.

709
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,541
When was the last time
you saw Dr. Monaghan, Tamar?

710
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,378
About three or four days ago.

711
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:30,298
When you did last see her,
was that at the clinic in Sheridan?

712
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:31,985
No, ma'am. I don't go to that clinic.

713
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,093
It's...

714
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,345
It's a little scary.

715
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,972
There's a lot of crazies there.

716
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,474
[chuckles]

717
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,476
Where do you see her?

718
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,980
Dr. Monaghan makes house calls.
She has a mobile unit.

719
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,649
Really like a van.

720
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,527
That mobile unit was
firebombed a few days ago.

721
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,903
Firebombed?

722
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,197
Someone broke a window

723
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,199
and threw a Molotov cocktail inside.

724
00:42:56,366 --> 00:43:00,995
That was just this past Tuesday
between 3:00 and 3:30 in the afternoon.

725
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:02,538
Where were you then?

726
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,919
Do you know anything about that?

727
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:10,338
Um...

728
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:17,345
Okay, Tamar, we're gonna need
to take a look around inside.

729
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:18,846
Yeah.

730
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:43,204
So, I'm still waiting for you to tell me

731
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:47,667
where you were between
3:00 and 3:30 on Tuesday.

732
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:51,462
I was in the hospital, sir.
I had an accident.

733
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,592
Well, I'm glad you're okay now.

734
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,516
Are you okay?

735
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,645
Not really.

736
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:12,275
Dr. Monaghan would tell
me to talk it out.

737
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,321
Hold on a second.

738
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,953
Here's the thing.

739
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:29,750
You make me nervous, sir.

740
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,546
You look a lot like my
commanding officer.

741
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:39,761
And he was pretty...

742
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,971
commanding.

743
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:57,279
I'll reach out to the hospital and
confirm what time she was discharged.

744
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,948
You gonna pass out again?

745
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:05,160
- What?
- Jesus, Walt.

746
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,038
Sit down. You look terrible.

747
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,482
And you're having a hard time
focusing on what I'm saying.

748
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,209
I'm fine. I... I just wasn't
listening to you, Vic.

749
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,877
- I, uh...
- Oh.

750
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,631
I was thinking about Molotov cocktails.

751
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,133
What about them?

752
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:24,722
Throwing a Molotov cocktail into a van
is a different act than overdosing.

753
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:28,016
One's aggressive, the other's passive.

754
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,645
Different people.

755
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,606
Donna always said it was a patient.

756
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,610
Um, I assumed it was the
same suicidal patient

757
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,695
she was visiting at the hospital, but...

758
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,490
She also said that they missed
a couple of appointments.

759
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:43,700
Four.

760
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,618
Their last four appointments.

761
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,955
One of the things that I took from
Donna's house was her calendar.

762
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:52,249
Maybe we can figure out which patient
missed her last four sessions.

763
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,668
Yeah.

764
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,464
[sighs]

765
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:13,187
Are you kidding me?

766
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:18,233
I told you,
you have to take those files back.

767
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,277
This is serious.

768
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,242
Dad?

769
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,870
What am I missing?

770
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,956
What?

771
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:37,253
I can't remember anything.

772
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:42,634
I, uh... I should be the one to...
to help her,

773
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:45,302
to know everything that happened,

774
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:50,516
but... it's like a fog that won't lift.

775
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,939
It's not your fault.

776
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:03,112
You were shot and you have a concussion.

777
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:06,533
You were there.

778
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:09,035
- What did I miss?
- I don't know.

779
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:13,415
When I walked in, you were on the floor,

780
00:47:13,498 --> 00:47:18,420
and then I-I ran into your room
and I found a bloody sheet,

781
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,630
and I brought it back to
try and stop the bleeding.

782
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,717
And then I called 911.

783
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,219
Did I say anything?

784
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,762
Where is she?

785
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,350
You kept saying, "Where is she?"

786
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:36,729
I thought you meant Mom.

787
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,191
Right.

788
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,735
I'm sorry.

789
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,737
If I'd known,

790
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,865
maybe I could've gotten Vic and Ferg
to start searching for Donna sooner.

791
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,284
It's my fault.

792
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,495
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Donna.

793
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,122
I just... I didn't know...

794
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,749
That I'd like it.

795
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:03,213
You were protecting my feelings.
I get it.

796
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,718
And I appreciate it.

797
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,345
And I'm also pretty sick of it.

798
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,932
'Cause I do the same thing.

799
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,476
You know, I-I keep secrets from you

800
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,438
because I don't want to disappoint you.

801
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,439
What secrets?

802
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,649
Not now.

803
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,153
What secrets, Cady?

804
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,076
I got a job.

805
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,247
Congratulations.

806
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,794
I'm working for Jacob Nighthorse.

807
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:46,466
[footsteps approaching]

808
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,509
Not now, Vic.

809
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:50,886
Okay.

810
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,513
[door closes]

811
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:54,682
I'm not working directly for him,

812
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,393
but he's funding a legal-aid
operation on the Res,

813
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,020
and he asked me to run it.

814
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,483
That's why I came to your cabin.

815
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:06,026
I came to tell you, Dad.

816
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,738
I think this job is the perfect
opportunity because...

817
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,406
Because you're my daughter.
He's using you.

818
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:13,868
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Think about it.

819
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,410
I did.

820
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:18,163
This casino is here
whether we like it or not.

821
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:24,003
And if I can use those
funds to help people...

822
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,088
I think Mom would've liked that.

823
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:29,383
I know this hurts you, Dad.

824
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,385
Just like the idea of someone
taking Mom's place hurts me.

825
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,893
But I think it's time we
move on with our lives

826
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,061
without secrets.

827
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:54,282
You said you took a bloody sheet
from my room to stop my bleeding.

828
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,035
What?

829
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:00,623
Are you sure there was already blood
on the sheet when you used it?

830
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,669
Yeah.

831
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,423
I have to get back to work.

832
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,806
So do I.

833
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,098
[door opens]

834
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,516
- Hey.
- Vic.

835
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,685
- Donna was shot.
- What?

836
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,437
There were two blood
spots in my bedroom.

837
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,560
We missed the second one
because it was on a sheet

838
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:27,315
that Cady used to stop my bleeding.

839
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:30,485
Shit, okay. Well, then I
think I know who shot her.

840
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,573
Duncan Butler. He missed
his last four sessions with Donna,

841
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,617
just like the guy that she mentioned
after her van was firebombed.

842
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:38,703
Good work, Detective.

843
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,791
[Walt] Are you Duncan Butler?

844
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,334
Look, I turned my music down,
for Christ's sakes, all right?

845
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,629
Why don't you just go
tell the Reynolds to lay off?

846
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,473
You were here three
days ago playing music?

847
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,340
- No, I was at work three days ago.
- Oh.

848
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,884
Well, can your wife verify that?

849
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,427
She can tell you I wasn't here,

850
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,304
and my boss can tell you I was there.

851
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,723
And where is "there"?

852
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,850
Continental Meats in Sheridan.

853
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,351
[Walt] Oh, Sheridan, huh?

854
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:06,021
Well, you wouldn't happen
to know a Donna Monaghan?

855
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:07,398
She works out that way.

856
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,774
No.

857
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,611
Well, she's not the psychiatrist

858
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,237
you've been seeing the last two years?

859
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,698
God damn it! She's not
supposed to talk about that.

860
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,283
- You seem like you're angry with her.
- Yeah, wouldn't you be?

861
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,651
That shit's supposed to be confidential,
and she goes and sics the sheriff on me.

862
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:24,331
She didn't sic me on you.
She didn't tell me anything about you.

863
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,167
Well, if she didn't tell you,

864
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,530
then you must've broken some laws
finding out I see her.

865
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,129
You know what, I'm calling the ACLU.

866
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,973
When you talk to them,
make sure to mention

867
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,676
that we're investigating someone
who set a van on fire.

868
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,053
- Is that what she told you?
- Like I said, she hasn't told me anything.

869
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,766
Because Donna Monaghan is missing.

870
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,225
Do you know anything about that?

871
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,730
Shit. Get around back.

872
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,400
[gunshot]

873
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,729
All right. Let's go get her.

874
00:51:54,753 --> 00:51:55,754
Hey!
[grunts]

875
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,740
Come on.
Drop the gun!

876
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,743
- Whoa, whoa.
- Drop the gun.

877
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:06,290
Come on.

878
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,379
Look, if she's missing,
we got to go find her.

879
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,669
Who's next on your list?

880
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,963
- Right now, there's just you.
- What?

881
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,808
Look, I didn't firebomb her van,
all right?

882
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,258
I sure as hell didn't kidnap her.

883
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,178
Then you won't mind if my deputy and me

884
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,722
take a good look around your home.

885
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,853
Fine.

886
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:35,569
Hey, but every minute you're in there
is a minute we're not looking for Donna.

887
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,822
Okay.

888
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:41,868
Well, thanks for your help.

889
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,786
Yep.

890
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:45,079
[sighs]

891
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,832
His boss at Continental Meats confirms

892
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,675
he was in the middle
of an eight-hour shift

893
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,086
when Donna's van got firebombed.

894
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,339
He was also working when she
and I were attacked, so...

895
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,885
So, I guess that leaves
the mysterious Andrew Price.

896
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:02,137
What do you think our next step is?

897
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,890
Well, I think my next step is sleep.

898
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,391
Seriously?

899
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,143
I mean, that's good.

900
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,686
You're finally talking some sense.

901
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,688
- I'll give you a ride to Henry's.
- No.

902
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:15,692
No, I need you to head upstairs,
see if anybody confirmed Andrew's story,

903
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,028
or see if the APB's generated any leads.

904
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,490
- Okay.
- Have Ruby call Henry to come pick me up.

905
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,825
Get some rest, Walt.

906
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,300
What?

907
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,386
I said nothing.

908
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,972
Yeah, but it's in how you said nothing.

909
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,516
- Speak.
- We should not be doing this.

910
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,726
What?

911
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:53,480
Trying to find the man who attempted to
kill Gab and me at the Crow Reservation

912
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,232
and might have Donna?

913
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,026
I am not saying that Walker
Browning should be ignored,

914
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,911
but maybe given your physical state
and the lawsuit you are facing...

915
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:05,242
Look, you can drive me and keep
your thoughts to yourself,

916
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,619
or you can set me out right here.

917
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:11,164
But you cannot drive me and
judge me at the same time.

918
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,631
[gear cranks]

919

Seriously?

920
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,970
You're gonna make me get out here?

921
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:27,014
No.

922
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,183
But I do not know which way to turn.
I have never been here before.

923
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:51,454
Barracks another half mile further on.

924
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,623
The active rig should be right here.

Doug.

932
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,646
What's going on here, Doug?

933
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,814
Doing my job.

934
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,066
You work for Newett Energy?

935
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:20,902
I do this week.

936
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,863
I'm a private contractor.
Shutdown engineer.

937
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,281
Newett determined these
wells were unproductive,

938
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,951
so they called us in to
plug it and close up shop.

939
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:31,287
When'd they make that decision?
[cellphone ringing]

940
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,247
Called us two days ago.

941
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,790
Two days ago.

942
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,043
You know Walker Browning?

943
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:38,752
No, never heard of him.

944
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,546
- Hello?
- Hey, I got a job for you, Hector.

<i>I got some blood samples I'd
like to share with him.</i>

950
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:55,227
Look, Henry, you don't get to
choose what's a good time or not.

951
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,062
I need Hector now.

952
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,982
I'm probably an hour away.

953
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:01,858
I'll see you in 45 minutes.

Henry.

00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:12,119
We got to get over to Newett headquarters,
figure out where they relocated Walker.

957
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,079
I cannot do that.

958
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:16,623
- Why not?
- I have someplace I have to be.

959

Do not make me leave you out here.
