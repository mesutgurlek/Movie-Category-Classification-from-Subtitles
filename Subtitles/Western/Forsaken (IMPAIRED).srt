00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,162
Whoa.

169
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,690
Mary Alice.

170
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,371
Heard people say in church
you were back.

171
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,369
Didn't believe it.

172
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,802
Needed to come out
and see for myself.

173
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,210
I've been back a few days or so.

174
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,041
A few days and you haven't
come and seen me?

175
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,402
I planned on it, I just...

176
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,164
You always were a terrible liar.

177
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,561
I waited for this day.

178
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,682
Thought about it.

179
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,565
Planned what I might say.

180
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,764
Now I don't know what to say.

181
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,970
You clearing all
this by yourself?

182
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,447
Yes, ma'am.

183
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,848
Lot of work for one man.

184
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,203
Shovel right over there
if you care to help.

185
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,323
You look well.

186
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
<i>So do you.</i>

187
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,842
I swear you look the same
as the day I left.

188
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,849
Now there you go lying again.

189
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,849
I don't recall you being

190
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,849
so distrustful of folks,
Mary Alice.

191
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,088
I'd never lie to you.

192
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,164
Well, I seem to recall you
saying something about

193
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,562
coming back after the war.

194
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,211
Well, I better let you
get back to your work.

195
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,801
Maybe after I get settled
we could ride out to the bluffs

196
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,809
like we used to.

197
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,241
That wouldn't be right.

198
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,163
I'm married.

199
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,163
Married?

200
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,279
Going on eight years now.

201
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,329
I have a little boy, Charlie.

202
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,489
I thought you knew.

203
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,128
No. No, I did not know that.

204
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,609
I waited for you.

205
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,042
But when the years passed
and there was no word and...

206
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,289
Mary Alice, you do not
owe me an explanation.

207
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,681
Who did you marry?

208
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,168
Tom Watson.

209
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,208
Tom's a good man.

210
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,324
Yes, he is.

211
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,325
Welcome home, John Henry.

212
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,481
Shit!

213
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,969
All right.
Bring 'em in, come on.

We was just coming
to pay you a visit.

217
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,399
Appreciate you saving us a ride.

218
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,244
I've got nothing to say to you.

219
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,408
Oh well,

220
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,568
I got something to say to you.

That's enough.

You don't wanna
kill him now, do ya?

228
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,321
Well maybe I do. I...

229
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,410
I hadn't decided yet.

230
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,445
I'm taking him home.

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,442
Uh, hold on there now.

232
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,444
It ain't you who's
doing the deciding.

233
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,125
May I take him home?

234
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,529
And what if I say no?
What you gonna do about it?

235
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,523
[Spits]

236
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,569
Nothing.

237
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,439
I'm sorry. I didn't
quite hear that.

238
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,886
Nothing.

239
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,171
All right, John Henry.

240
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,484
You have my permission
to take him home.

241
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,051
Somethings troubling you?

242
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,810
Your mother and I kept
asking ourselves,

243
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,127
asking God,

244
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,762
what we done wrong
in your upbringing?

245
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,611
What did we do that filled you
with so much hate?

246
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,531
It weren't you.

247
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,930
John 8:32, remember?

248
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,520
The truth will set you free.

249
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,523
God knows the truth.

250
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,519
All through the war I kept
asking myself, where was God?

251
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,966
Where was he at Shiloh
and Seven Pines

252
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,969
when men lay dead and dying?

253
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,050
All good men,
God-fearing men.

254
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,562
They just lay there, begging
for some small act of mercy

255
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,847
on His behalf.

256
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,090
And then it finally
dawned on me:

257
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,208
There ain't no God.

258
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,607
[dishes clatter]

259
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,925
There is no God?

260
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,003
All I'm saying is that
if there was ever a time

261
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,011
that man needed God it was then
and trust me, he wasn't there.

262
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,563
If you're expecting God to
save you, he ain't gonna.

263
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,848
Most men came out of that
war wanting nothing more

264
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,247
to do with killing, but not you.

265
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,930
You went looking for it.

266
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,566
God is not responsible
for the life you choose.

267
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,927
I did not choose it!

268
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,001
Get off my land.

269
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,327
We just come to finish
the conversation

270
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,727
that was interrupted, Dan.

271
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,450
DAVE:
Let us avoid unpleasantness.

272
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,884
Sir, I implore you
to see reason.

273
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,245
If you take a fair grasp of your
situation, you will arrive

274
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,647
at the only reasonable
conclusion available to you.

275
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,722
I'm stayin'.

276
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,680
Dirt and rock.

277
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,648
Exactly like the dirt and the
rocks you would find anywhere.

278
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,691
Yeah, but it's my dirt
and my rock!

279
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,679
Yes, and a fine rock it is too.

280
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,251
Is worth dying over?

281
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,681
You believe your wife
would prefer the dirt

282
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:49,679
and the rock to you?

283
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,679
Will this keep her warm at night

284
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,605
or put the food on the table?

285
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,968
Is it gonna teach your
children right from wrong?

286
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,679
Comfort them in their beds

287
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,083
when they're frightened
by the wind?

288
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,719
You see, I do understand.

289
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,849
I do understand. I truly do
understand the inequities

290
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,008
of your position, sir,

291
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,886
but I believe when you weigh
the alternatives,

292
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,083
you will see that...
[gunshot]

293
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,765
There was no need for that.

294
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,726
We were talking.

295
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,690
It would appear the
conversation's over now, Dave.

296
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,683
He was about to see reason.

297
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,842
CLYDE: You actually ever
kill anybody, Dave,

298
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,521
or you just talk 'em to death?

Anybody else have
something to say?

301
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,727
REVEREND <i>CLAYTON:
Daniel Peterson...</i>

302
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,930
is now safely
in the embrace of our Lord.

303
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:17,730
But for us, here on earth,
a good man has been taken.

304
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,489
A provider for his family,
a friend to our community,

305
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,323
and in our despair,
we rail against God.

306
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,209
Our faith is tested,
pushed to its very limits.

307
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,530
But Almighty God has a purpose.

308
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,803
And senseless
though it may seem to us,

309
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:48,324
it is not for mere mortal man
to question God's wisdom.

310
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,809
It is for us to persevere
in a righteous way.

311
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,680
- We gotta do something.
Like what?

312
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,370
- I don't know.
We can't sit around doing nothing.

313
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,766
What about getting a sheriff?

314
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,571
We tried. Most men ain't got the
stomach for a fight like this.

315
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,921
We need a man who knows trouble,
a man who others fear.

316
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,284
You suppose he might
come to our aid?

317
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,967
Put that out of
your head right now.

318
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,765
We could pay him. Took
a collection. We got $200.

319
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,842
He's done with that life.

320
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,248
I can't believe James
would let it come to this.

321
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,126
They killed Daniel Peterson.

322
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,890
I never thought
they'd kill one of us.

323
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,650
It's only gonna get worse.

324
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,161
What makes you say that?

325
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,971
'Cause after the first one,
it gets easier.

No, thank you.

328
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,767
Mrs. Peterson came in
and sold me her farm

329

gonna happen Dave, huh? What?

Am I wrong?

I didn't feel any

through that damn war.

from my hair.

you could bring it back to me.

You wanna explain to me
how you took that task

and fucked it up
in every conceivable way?

you, but to my way of thinking

no way that adds up
to all right.

dealt with quickly,

00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,401
I'm amused at how many times
my ears play tricks on me.

653
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,403
For a moment I thought
I heard you say you wish

654
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,721
to extricate yourself from
the agreement we made.

655
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,241
Of course, I know you
couldn't've said that.

656
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,360
I did say that.

657
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,526
See, I been thinking my...

658
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:17,721
Shut up!

659
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,081
Before you open your yap again,
I want you to consider

660
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,767
the full ramifications
of your fucking actions.

661
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,519
We had a deal.

662
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,519
I didn't sign nothing.

663
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,522
Words were spoke.
Hands were shook.

664
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,682
Well, I've had a
change of heart.

665
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,690
Come to realize that a new
start don't mean much

666
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,888
if you carrying old
feelings with you.

667
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,048
Oh well, that's very
fucking deep, Tom.

668
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,128
Almost poetic.

669
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,559
And as I wipe a weepy tear
from my eye let me say this:

670
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,688
I'm not one who holds high
principles, but when a man

671
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,283
shakes my hand and says
he's gonna do something,

672
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,046
I expect him to follow through.

673
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,767
Now you be here before
the end of business Tuesday

674
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,291
and sign those papers.

675
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,563
And bid this town
a fond farewell

676
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,765
or suffer the fucking
consequences.

677
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,520
Well, I ain't gonna just
sit here pretending

678
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,321
that you and I have ever
seen eye to eye on, well...

679
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,488
pretty much anything.

680
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,606
Reason I ain't coming here
begging for forgiveness

681
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,491
is because I don't think
I deserve it.

682
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,325
But I would be mighty grateful
if you could make my purpose

683
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,410
a little more clear to me.

684
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:45,166
Before I came home,
I was just drifting.

685
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,851
Town to town.

686
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,361
Ended up in a small
place called Norton,

687
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,131
way over in Kansas.

688
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,685
Been riding hard, went in
the saloon for a drink.

689
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,689
Two men come up on me
looking for a fight,

690
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,168
so I gave it to 'em.

691
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,241
Cut one of 'em up pretty bad,
outdrew on the other.

692
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,682
Told him to pick up
his partner and get.

693
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,561
All I had to do
was leave that town.

694
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,126
But I didn't.

695
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,448
I waited.

696
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,719
Daring 'em to come after me.

697
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,328
And sure enough,
when I walked outside

698
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,286
those two young men
started firing on me.

699
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:40,604
Shot out my horse. I drew
my pistol. I fired back.

700
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,770
I killed them.
I killed them both.

701
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,685
In the middle of all of it
one of my shots went wide,

702
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,967
straight through
a storefront window.

703
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,405
Woman came out screaming,

704
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,285
covered in blood.

705
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,726
First I thought I'd shot her.

706
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,445
Then her husband come out...

707
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,081
carrying a little boy.

708
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,765
I killed a boy, Pop.

709
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,286
He looked to be
the same age as William.

710
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,971
He just lay there dead
'cause of what I'd done.

711
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,969
Just like William did.

712
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,969
William didn't die
because of you.

713
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,122
You're not responsible
for your brother's death.

714
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,605
You told me not to take him
down to the river.

715
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,009
I told both of you. You were
boys doing what boys do.

716
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,488
It was an accident.
Tragic, but an accident.

717
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,602
I often think about
what my brother

718
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,563
would've grown up to be.

719
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,886
Now I can't stop thinking
about what that little boy

720
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,447
from Norton would've
grown up to be.

721
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,890
The only thing I know
that's true in my heart

722
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,129
is that both of those boys
would've grown up to be

723
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,208
a far cry better than me.

724
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,002
Pa, I'm so sorry
for what I've become.

728
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,011
Go on, stay inside.

729
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,851
Might I have a word
with you, ma'am?

730
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,163
We have no business that
I know of, Mr. McCurdy.

731
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,328
That you know of.

732
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,842
Your husband and I have spoken
about him selling his farm.

733
01:04:41,843 --> 01:04:43,842
Well, I'd be surprised

734
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,922
if my husband entertained
such an idea.

735
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,929
Well, ma'am, if that
surprises you,

736
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,042
you'll be dumbstruck to learn

737
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,686
he's agreed to the sale
of the property.

738
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,768
I don't believe you.

739
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,002
Well, that's of little
concern to me,

740
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,209
being as he's the title holder.

741
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,289
I want you off my land.

742
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,928
And you have every right
to do so for another...

743
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,487
32 hours and 18 minutes.

744
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,762
And if we're still here?

745
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,089
Then I'd start looking
for a black dress.

746
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,008
Let's go.

747
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,486
Whoa.

748
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,801
McCurdy wants our land.

749
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,451
You should be speaking
with your husband.

750
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,881
I'm speaking to you.

751
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:54,329
Tom made a deal with McCurdy
and now he's changed his mind.

752
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,481
Mary Alice, you need to go home
and speak with your husband.

753
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,449
He's gonna get himself killed.

754
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,285
I don't want that for my boy.

755
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,846
You know why he's doing this.

756
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,685
To prove that he's
as good as you are.

757
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,922
Mary Alice,
I've seen this before

758
01:06:12,923 --> 01:06:14,919
and it only ends one way.

759
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,048
You wanna save your family?

760
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,931
You take what McCurdy's
offering and you move away.

761
01:06:19,932 --> 01:06:22,605
You understand me?
You move away.

762
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,928
Excuse me, Mr. McCurdy?

763
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,959
Reverend's here.
He wants a word with you.

764
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,247
Did he say what it's about?

765
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,247
Tom Watson.

766
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,967
Oh, I should've known.
Show him in.

767
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,884
You're to leave the
Watsons alone, James.

768
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,327
You sure do have a
repetitive nature, Samuel.

769
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,329
I mean it.

770
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,728
Mean what? What are you
gonna do if I don't, hm?

771
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,049
Command the Lord to strike me
dead with a lightning bolt?

772
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,206
We were friends.

773
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,448
I'm asking you,

774
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,007
stop doing what you're doing
to Tom Watson.

775
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,920
Tom Watson shook my hand
and agreed to a deal.

776
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,923
He's not going to leave.

777
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,923
He Will.

778
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,846
One way or another, he will.

Well, the blade missed
any vital organs,

but he did lose a fair
amount of blood.
