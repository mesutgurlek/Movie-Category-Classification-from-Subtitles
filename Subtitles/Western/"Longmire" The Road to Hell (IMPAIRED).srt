Not exactly.

166
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,639
We found his rig. It had been abandoned.

What?

168

R.J. Watts, Wyoming livestock bureau.

Detective, thanks for coming by.

236
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:26,571
I understand you found the trucker.

237
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,140
It's a good start. What did he say?

238
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,142
We haven't questioned him
yet. He's in my office.

239
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,311
I thought you'd want to hear
what he had to say firsthand,

240
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:36,648
so I gave him a few minutes
to eat and collect himself.

241
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:41,186
So, this rig tries to pass me.

242
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:44,522
And I look over, and the
guy in the passenger seat's

243
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,126
wearing a ski mask, waving a rifle at me.

244
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,461
Bastards cut me off.

245
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:51,930
I hit the brakes as hard as I could.

246

How many other people in that rig?

247
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:58,336
Maybe four of them jumped
out, all wearing masks.

might take these cattle?

No. They barely spoke.

ringing from the shots.

is getting tossed in the
trailer with the cattle.

259
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,598
then dumped me in the middle of nowhere.

out this hijacking from jail?

Why is that?

Because a couple of years
before he went to jail,

I had a guy in Dunwood's

Well, Dunwood must have found out about it

because I found my guy, too.

490
00:23:51,856 --> 00:23:54,257
people will look back
on you as a barbarian.

491
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:57,560
Darling, why do you
think God gave us these?

492
00:23:57,662 --> 00:24:00,196
They're called bicuspids.

493
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:02,766
They're for tearing meat, not tofu.

494
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:05,835
People like you are destroying this planet!

495
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:07,137
- Hey!
- It's people like you that are killing...

496
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,672
Get out of here, Omar! Enough!

497
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:10,840
Show's over. Everybody go home.

498
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:13,610
You. Don't let that guy
get under your skin, okay?

499
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:16,946
You're this close to being
arrested for disorderly conduct.

500
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:18,815
He could file assault charges against you

501
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:20,116
if he really wanted to.

502
00:24:20,217 --> 00:24:21,151
Vic: Go.

503
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,852
Omar, what are you doing?

504
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:24,854
I was just minding my own business,

505
00:24:24,955 --> 00:24:26,656
delivering somebody flowers,

506
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,826
when this ecoterrorist came
up, started talking garbage.

507
00:24:29,894 --> 00:24:32,162
These better not be for Vic.

508
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:35,298
Oh, come on, Walt. It's all in good fun.

509
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:38,134
Didn't this kind of harmless
fun cost you your first wife?

510
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:42,138
- All right, I'll ease up.
- No.

511
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:44,774
Don't ease up. Just stop. Okay?

[Cows mooing]

515
00:25:00,157 --> 00:25:02,225
I'm looking for a man named Jordan Helms.

516
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:05,061
Now, the feds say he moves around a lot

517
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:06,262
but might be holed up on the res.

518
00:25:06,364 --> 00:25:08,264
First of all, Jordan Helms is

519
00:25:08,366 --> 00:25:11,601
just an activist who
posts lectures on YouTube.

520
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:13,103
And he is not holed up.

521
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,138
He's a Brit who's shacked up
with his Cheyenne girlfriend.

522
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:17,006
Supposedly, Helms has connections

523
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:19,075
to the E.L.F., Earth Liberation Front.

524
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:21,778
Supposedly, they sabotaged
a fracking operation

525
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:23,613
in Cumberland County last month.

526
00:25:23,714 --> 00:25:25,281
Same deal with the eco signs.

527
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:28,685
Maybe Mr. Helms has raised
his activism to a new level.

528

Pardon me for not stopping. [Panting]

531
00:25:37,728 --> 00:25:39,896
This machine has a small dynamo...

532
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,599
that creates electric power.

533
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,034
I've almost generated our day's needs.

534
00:25:45,102 --> 00:25:46,736
Mr. Helms, I'm investigating

535
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,938
the hijacking of a truck full of cattle.

536
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,641
Cattle are showing up with
signs attacking big beef.

Shadow said she saw it on the news.

539
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:56,146
I don't watch.

540
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:59,682
Look at this, then.

I don't know anything about it.

[Sighs] That said,

545
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:10,593
I wholeheartedly support whoever did.

546
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,963
And civil disobedience is a
powerful weapon to enact change.

547
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:17,934
I've seen what arrogant
actions can do to an empire.

548
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:22,806
The Cheyenne people,
they respect the earth.

549
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,974
She needs our support.

550
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,844
Am I right, brother?

00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:31,548
I suppose... brother.

Walt: You reach a lot of
people with your videos.

553
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,853
My deputy tells me you have
50,000 followers on Facebook.

554
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:39,122
This is a war.

555
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,525
I'm fighting for the
planet. It can get ugly.

556
00:26:42,626 --> 00:26:45,695
Yeah, real ugly. Like murdering ugly.

557
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:48,598
I thought you said it was
a cattle-truck hijacking.

558
00:26:48,699 --> 00:26:50,533
The man driving the truck was killed.

559
00:26:50,634 --> 00:26:54,204
Look... I want to be clear.

560
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:56,306
I could not and would not ever support

561
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,408
any action that results in violence.

562
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,711
I had nothing to do with this.

563
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:04,214
Unless posting those
speeches on the Internet

564
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:06,749
inspired some unhinged people.

565
00:27:06,817 --> 00:27:09,118
Then you had a hell of a lot to do with it.

566
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:12,755
This is America, where
people are supposed to

567
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:16,292
take responsibility for their own actions.

Yeah, I didn't think so.

I had the D.A. draw up papers
for Dunwood to be furloughed.

00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:55,563
Now, I'll ask a question.

650
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:57,198
You don't want to answer
it, that's your call.

651
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,768
You got a hand named Whitey Culver?

652
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:02,537
Yeah. He's working now. Why?

653
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,039
Were you aware that whitey served some time

654
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,740
at the State Pen Ranch?

655
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:08,009
He got locked up for a bar
fight that went too far,

656
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,544
not for rustling.

657
00:31:09,612 --> 00:31:11,880
Whitey served with a
guy named Bobby Dunwood,

658
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:14,582
one of the biggest rustlers in Wyoming.

659
00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:16,618
So, I'm gonna need to talk to whitey.

660

He lied to me.

661
00:31:18,688 --> 00:31:20,522
He told me he never met a one.

662

Well, it's true what they say, isn't it?

done a good job for you here?

You know, I had good intentions hiring you.

No. Branch will be back soon.

Depends on what you do on your date.

I just got one question for you, Trent.

Are you okay with Whitey
Culver getting fired

Yeah, you do. You both do.

Yeah. So are a lot of people.

He has a very impressive

It's not against the law to
express an opinion, is it?

729
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:14,667
No. But it sure gives you a motive.

730

And he's opportunity son of a rancher.

So, why not arrest the board of B.P.?

It was just a hoax to raise awareness.

811
00:38:19,938 --> 00:38:22,173
'Cause I didn't know she was
one till she asked for the cash.

812
00:38:22,274 --> 00:38:25,042
[Cellphone rings]

813
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,577
Yeah. Watts here.

814
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:27,912
- Walt: R.J.
- Oh, hey, Walt.

815
00:38:28,013 --> 00:38:30,081
- Dunwood with you?
- Yeah, I got him.

816
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,782
We're heading back to State Pen Ranch.

817
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,919
See you in about... 10, 15.

818
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,253
No, you won't.

819
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:38,623
You got your own plans for Dunwood,

820
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:41,058
same as you had for Cooper James.

821
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:43,761
What are you talking about, Walt? I...

822
00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:47,031
Look, j... just stay tight,
and... and I'll see you soon.

823
00:38:47,132 --> 00:38:49,100
I'm bringing Dunwood in.

824
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:53,170
Then why are you driving
in the wrong direction?

825
00:38:53,238 --> 00:38:56,641
Why you following me?

826
00:38:56,742 --> 00:39:00,144
Why are you heading out of town, R.J.?

827
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:03,014
'Cause I'm going home.

828
00:39:03,115 --> 00:39:04,615
Not with Bobby Dunwood.

829
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:07,451
There's not gonna be
any more hangings, R.J.

830
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,753
Look... that thing with Cooper...

831
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,988
I didn't mean for that to happen.

832
00:39:11,056 --> 00:39:16,227
Yeah, I followed your deputy
and him back to the truck depot.

833
00:39:16,328 --> 00:39:19,730
But... h... he didn't smell like cattle.

834
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:21,599
I just noticed it a little
quicker than you did.

835
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,635
And when I pressed him
on it, he kept lying.

836
00:39:24,703 --> 00:39:27,138
And I hate a liar. Can't stand one.

837
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,839
I knew damn well he stole them.

838
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:31,509
He did. But not for Dunwood.

839
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,878
He was working with the rancher's son.

840
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:35,212
I told you I got nothing to do with this.

841
00:39:35,313 --> 00:39:37,548
Now pull the truck over and let me out!

842
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:41,719
There's a connection, Walt.
You just ain't found it yet.

843
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,088
This piece of trash
has ruined enough lives.

844
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:45,623
And I'll be damned

845
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:47,692
if I'm gonna give him
another slap on the wrist

846
00:39:47,793 --> 00:39:49,160
and let them unleash him again

847
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,961
to go back out and start stealing,

848
00:39:51,063 --> 00:39:53,664
ruin more lives, take more lives.

849
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:59,170
No. No, that ends, and that ends now.

850
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,081
R.J.

851
00:40:10,182 --> 00:40:12,917
R.J., I can't let you leave Absaroka.

852
00:40:16,922 --> 00:40:18,956
Now, there's an honorable way to end this.

853
00:40:19,024 --> 00:40:23,694
How's that, Walt?

854
00:40:23,762 --> 00:40:26,864
All them sons of bitches I sent away...

855
00:40:26,932 --> 00:40:31,202
not a single one of them
is still behind bars.

856
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,972
Now they gonna put me in jail.

857
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,775
So, where's the honor?

858
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:42,113
Detective...

859
00:40:42,214 --> 00:40:45,282
think about what you're doing.

860
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:53,557
Sheriff, I have.

861
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:55,059
I have.

863

[Inhales deeply] You got your seatbelt on?

864
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:04,502
No.

865
00:41:04,603 --> 00:41:06,170
Good. [Engine revs]

867
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,508
What are you doing?!

868
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:12,143
Hey!

869
00:41:13,678 --> 00:41:15,980

Aw, you're awake.

876
00:42:06,097 --> 00:42:08,065
I wanted to surprise you.

877
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,601
- What's the occasion?
- Doesn't have to be an occasion.

- You hurt your finger?
- Love hurts, babe.

00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:19,176
Plus, I got competition from
that secret admirer of yours.

882
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:22,112
So I got to go big. [Clicks tongue]

They found me.
