Marshal Duckett?
I'm Sheriff Parker.

00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,256
My deputy, Tuck.
Welcome to Ghost Town.

3
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,559
Come a long way, Sheriff.
What's goin' on here?

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,128
We appreciate that,
Marshal, we truly do.

5
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,898
Looks like this town's
already cleaned itself up.

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,599
Yeah? How's that?

7
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,637
Well, sir,
Harmon Teaster came to town.

8
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,572
- Harmon Teaster?
- Yes, sir.

<i>[Narrator] American settlers</i>

<i>Blood was thicker</i>

17
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,442
<i>and their conflicts were often</i>
<i>settled in pounds of flesh--</i>

18
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:27,112
<i>where an eye for an eye</i>

19
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:31,517
<i>was an unspoken duty toward</i>
<i>preserving family honor.</i>

20
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,587
<i>Rightin' the wrongs</i>

<i>Feelings toward</i>

You thought you saw her.

00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,962
- I did.
- It's the fever.

47
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,897
I did see her.

48
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,170
Just lie a spell and rest.

49
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,740
I'm making some broth

Pa! John Burnett's

They're coming this way.

00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,610
I told you Pa
would come for me.

58
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,979
Your pa can come say
anything he wants, boy,

59
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,249
but you're still gonna stand
trial for killin' that Injun.

Pa...I don't think
he's coming here to talk.

Why don't you
just let him go?

64
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:11,103
Do you think that's right,
Harmon? Just turn him loose?

Boy makes a lot
of sense there, Sheriff.

- I said shut up!

I ask you again, do you think
that's the right thing to do?

69
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,051
Just set him free?

Ransom,
you got my son.

71
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,902
Your son killed an
Injun boy in cold blood.

72

I saw him with my own two eyes.

[John] That wasn't no boy.
That was a savage.

Doesn't matter.
He's standing trial for what he did.

75
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,901
My son got some
growin' up to do,

76

this trouble over some thievin' redskin.

Now you tell me how
we can work this out.

just back yourself out of here.

162
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,471
Did they follow us?

163
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,974
They didn't follow us.

164
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,718
You must eat
to have strength.

165
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,591
I can't.

166
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,636
[Violet]
Please? Just try a little.

167
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:31,076
No. [whimpers] No.
I don't want to.

168
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,945
- You're gettin' worse.
- I'm not hungry.

169
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:37,049
You're gettin' worse,
and I think you need medicine.

170
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,919
I've tried all of Ma's cures,
but the fever won't break.

171
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,857
Maybe...

172
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,293
I could go to town.

173
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,429
No. You don't go to town.

174
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,965
I know.
Papa was killed in town.

175
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,636
You don't go to town.

176
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:00,139
Whatever happened there
happened a long time ago.

177
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,207
Things have changed.

178
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,278
You don't know if
your uncle will get that--

179
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,747
He could be gone
for weeks, Pa!

180
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,283
- We don't know how long.
- No.

181
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,719
- Please.
- No, you don't go.

182
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,721
I know the memories
are hard on you.

183
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:16,605
You don't go.

184
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,458
And I know how you
feel about what you did.

185
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,995
[sobbing] Susie.

186
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,831
Susie...

187
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,544
<i>[Ransom's voice]</i>
<i>Do you think that's right, Harmon?</i>

188
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,612
<i>[echoes]</i>
<i>...that's right, Harmon?</i>

189
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,152
[shouts]

190
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:51,623
Thought we were
gonna lose you.

191
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,464
No.

192
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,899
You been down
nearly a week.

193
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,268
Susie been by your side
the whole time.

194
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,406
She's taken
a shine to you.

195
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,878
She's down by the river,
bathin' in the moonlight.

196
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,180
Women things,
I reckon. [chuckles]

197
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,885
I know what you're thinking.

198
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,054
You think if you can get
far enough away from here

199
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,156
and if you've taken fond
of Susie, well, then--

200
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,532
I have taken a...

201
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:34,967
shine to her.

202
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,573
But a man's got to do...

203
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,511
what he's got to do.

204
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:49,882
I understand about righting
wrongs done to family.

205
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,917
I could help you.

206
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,088
This ain't your fight.

207
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,496
Well, you'd best go
'fore she comes back.

208
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,467
Take the horse.
We'll wait for you here.

209
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:49,808
I'm sorry. I can't
let you die like Ma.

210
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:11,163
<i>[Young Violet's voice]</i>
<i>I can't let you die.</i>

212
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,354
[screaming continues]

213
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,802
What the hell's
going on here?

214
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,006
My leg! My leg!

215
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,641
Leave him alone!

216
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,543
Marion!

217
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:02,281

[John groaning]

221
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,744
How much wood
you think she'll take?

222
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:09,415
You're gonna have to replace all of this.
I can tell that already.

223
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,184
- And...
- What?

224
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,255
Cole, how much
did you pay for this?

225
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,190
Pete gave me
a good deal on it.

226
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,592
- He said it was slightly used.
- "Slightly"?

227
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,331
Look at this thing.

228
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:24,129
It looks like it's been up and down
the Oregon Trail a half dozen times.

229
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,665
Damn it all to hell!
Damn!

230
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,903
She still
wants to leave?

231
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,504
You know...

232
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,081
This town is full
of whores and sinners.

233
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,422
Good morning, madame,
and how are you today?

234
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:52,524
Morning.
Morning.

235
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,397
Is this it?

236
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,933
Yeah. I know it
don't look like much,

237
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:03,168
but with a few improvements,
it'll work.

238
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,870
How long?

239
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,740
Couple days.
Maybe a week.

240
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:12,044
A week? I want out
of this godforsaken town now!

241
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,247
And you...
your father...

242
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,182
[Bobcat]
Happy birthday, Willy.

243
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,786
He's the animal
that killed my brother.

244
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:26,091
And you do nothing!

245
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:35,467
Looks like you got
a problem with your missy.

246
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,569
[laughing]

247
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,672
You got somethin'
you wanna say to me?

248
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,243
I don't believe
in guns.

249
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,380
If I did...

250
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,015
You'd be dead.

251
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:54,920
It's lucky for you I don't
believe in shooting an unarmed man.

252
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,890
It's downright
unsporting.

253
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:03,629
But I'd be happy to loan you one.
Bang! [laughing]

254
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,798
That's enough, Jim.
Put it away.

255
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:11,070
So, Willy, your pa's having a birthday party
for you tonight down at the Silver Dollar.

256
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:13,005
Is that right?

257
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,040
Just tell him
that I'm not interested.

258
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:20,512
Hey, uh, you know
how your daddy gets.

259
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,850
Think it'd be best
if you just came, you know.

260
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:27,353
He ain't gonna take it
too kindly if you don't come,

261
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:30,255
bein' that you're
the guest of honor and all!

262
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:06,125
Well, lookee here.

263
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:09,294
Look like another whore's
come to town. [cackling]

264
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:47,566
At 30, I was involved
in so much.

265
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:51,270
Mining, owning saloons,
land, more.

266
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,608
Will has no interest
in any of that.

267
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,613
That boy is meek
and worthless to me.

268
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,016
- But he's your blood, Victor.
- Yeah.

269
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:06,552
Maybe he'll come around.

270
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:10,723
Hopefully. Ah.

271
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,397
[Victor]
Mmm...

272
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,432
Coffee?

273
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:27,172
Shot of poison, sir?

274
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,208
Not this early.

275
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:39,184
Here. Buy yourself
something nice for tonight.

276
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:40,753
Thank you.

277
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:55,434
You know... I think I have
an idea how to loosen Will up.

278
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,869
[laughing]

279
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:39,545
Dear Almighty Father,
it's me, Violet.

280
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:43,015
I've never been
in a church before,

281
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:45,584
so forgive me
if I do something wrong.

282
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,622
I ask that you send your
healing hand down to touch my pa,

283
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,224
Harmon Teaster.

284
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:56,495
Have mercy
and don't call him home yet.

285
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,065
He's an honest man

286
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,334
and always a good
husband and father.

287
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:05,571
Don't ask
to save others.

288
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:09,908
You might put me
out of business.

289
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:11,810
Elmer Inlow's the name.

290
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,284
Folks round here
call me Digger.

291
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:23,922
I do all the burying
when duty calls.

292
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:26,425
All up through Haywood
and Buncombe County.

293
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,168
So, uh...

294
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:40,072
did you say
your pa was sick?

295
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:41,573
Yes, sir.

296
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:46,612
You say his name
was <i>Harmon</i> Teaster?

297
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:51,016
Is it?

298
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:55,521
Could you direct me
to the doctor's office?

299
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:57,456
I'm sure I passed it.

300
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:04,329
Morning.

301
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,402
Morning, Will.

302
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,007
I'm Violet.

303
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:18,444
Will Burnett.
Good to meet you.

304
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:22,348
I'll leave you two
to yourselves.

305
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:27,252
I got business
to take care of.

306
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,426
[sighs] That man
is a little strange.

307
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,028
Strange. I know.

308
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:44,670
This is
a beautiful church.

309
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:47,039
Thank you.

310
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,274
Is it yours, or...

311
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:53,612
No. I'm just the caretaker,
I guess you could say.

312
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,115
Caretaker?

313
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,784
See, our preacher,
he kind of left town,

314
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:02,621
and some of the folks still like
to get together on Sundays.

315
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,890
So I'm trying
to keep it open and...

316
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,760
do a little reading from
the Good Book here and there.

317
00:27:07,761 --> 00:27:09,428
You preach.

318
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:11,864
I wouldn't go so far
as to call it preaching.

319
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,999
Just...good folks
getting together

320
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,869
for a little bit
of reading, praying.

321
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,904
I think that's wonderful.

322
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,677
- Well...
- Well...

323
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:28,013
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

324
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,448
No, say what you
were gonna say.

325
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:32,918
I really wasn't saying
anything, so please.

326
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,990
I was gonna ask if you could
direct me to the doctor's office.

327
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,658
You do have
a doctor in town?

328
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,294
Oh, yeah.
Dr. Hugh Morrison.

329
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:43,629
He's a wonderful man,

330
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,199
and, uh, I'd be happy
to take you to see him.

331
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,712
Thank you.

332
00:27:47,713 --> 00:27:50,169
Is it all right if I leave
my horse tied up here?

333
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,339
- Yeah, that'd be fine.
- I shouldn't be too long.

334
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,941
Are you... sick
or something?

335
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:57,476
No, my pa is.

336
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:01,380
Sorry.
Well, right this way.

337
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:10,589
You should come to church
on Sunday with me.

338
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,758
Might be a nice change.

339
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:18,097
Might be. It gets harder and harder
to do this thing all the time.

340
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:20,165
- You remember my friend Ally?
- Sure.

341
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:23,335
From Richmond?
I had a letter from her.

342
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:25,471
And she's getting along
just fine.

343
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,875
She's married now, and she's
looking to have a family.

344
00:28:31,644 --> 00:28:34,046
You help some
to help themselves,

345
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:36,382
and you watch over
the others until then.

346
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:39,985
You do a good thing here,
Birdie.

347
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:43,689
Why, General James Martin.

348
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,858
How you doin'?

349
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:49,661
Listen,
you wouldn't know the...

350
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:51,730
whereabouts of Victor Burnett now,
would you?

351
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,132
[spits]

352
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:57,302
Buzzard.

353
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,214
[sighs]
Good morning.

354
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:11,150
- Good morning.
- Could I have one?

355
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:16,722
I don't want that.
Give me the good stuff.

356
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:24,396
Anybody know where, uh,

357
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:27,433
Mr. Burnett is, or what
kind of mood he's in?

358
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,501
He's in a foul mood
this morning.

359
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:33,172
He is a little more
on edge than normal.

360
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:36,308
To hell with you, Digger!

361
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:39,745
You ain't never gonna get me
in one of your boxes.

362
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:41,880
Yeah, we'll see.
Another drink.

363
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,288
- What's he so edgy about?
- Hard to say.

364
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:50,689
Well...

365
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:56,228
Well, I think they're trying to plan
a birthday party for Will tonight.

366
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:57,996
- A party?
- Yeah, he is...

367
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,332
planning a birthday party
this evening.

368
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:03,702
But he can't
find Will.

369
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:08,173
I just saw him coming down the
street a while ago with Sorrells.

370
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:11,810
And, you know, he had
that biddy old wife with him.

371
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,179
[Judd, Digger laughing]

372
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,399
Give me another drink.

373
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,783
This is gonna be a good
celebration tonight.

374
00:30:21,021 --> 00:30:24,223
Madame Birdie,
if I was you, I'd move!

375
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:25,724
- Digger...
- [Digger] Now, Jackknife...

376
00:30:25,725 --> 00:30:28,027
I'm gonna make
old Digger dance!

377
00:30:28,028 --> 00:30:30,562
- You better put that gun away.
- [Judd] Put that gun away!

378
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,664
I'll put you
in a pine box.

379
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,900
To hell with you, too,
Mr. Judd!

380
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,869
- [laughing]
- [gunshot]

381
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:46,311
Runnin' out
like some crippled bird.

382
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:52,351
[Little Jack]
Pa.

383
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,386
It's all right.
It's all right.

384
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:56,989
Pa, I thought I told you
you can't be firing in here.

385
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:01,427
I was just having a little fun.
I was gonna make old Digger dance.

386
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:04,663
- Yeah, I know.
- Victor used to make him dance.

387
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:06,699
Victor shot him
one time.

388
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,234
Mr. Burnett doesn't like to be woken up.
Gotta get you outta here.

389
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:11,470
Hey! What's all
the ruckus down here?

390
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,472
I'm sorry, Mr. Burnett.
My pa, he just--

391
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:17,509
Listen, Little Jack.
I can talk for my own self.

392
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:22,181
Well, Mr. Mayor,

393
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:24,983
I see you brought
your pet dog with you.

394
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:27,252
[chuckles]

395
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:30,622
You may dress like
a white man, Injun,

396
00:31:30,623 --> 00:31:33,459
but that don't make you one.

397
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,594
And I'll tell you
something else.

398
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:40,099
I've killed a-many
of your kind in my day.

399
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,700
Yeah. Chief!

400
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:43,669
- Come on, Pa.
- I told you.

401
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,004
- [Victor shouts]
- [Jackknife shouts]

402
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:51,343
Old Knife here
worked for my pa.

403
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:54,513
He's a good man.
Just a bit too much shine.

404
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:57,916
- Take him home to sleep it off.
- Yes, sir, I will. Come on.

405
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:12,564
Huh. Well,
I don't know, Victor.

406
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:15,668
I'm just pleased
to help you any way I can.

407
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:18,671
You know I appreciate your
support for my railroad project.

408
00:32:18,672 --> 00:32:21,674
Well then, of course, I'm gonna
expect your support come election time.

409
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:23,375
- Right?
- You know you'll have that.

410
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:25,444
Okay.
Copperhead, let's go.

411
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,395
- Mr. Burnett, sir...
- Very busy today, Digger.

412
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:45,798
Oh, Mr. Burnett.
I got some information

413
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,733
you might find
very interesting.

414
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:50,169
What?

415
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,771
It's about
your pa's murderer.

416
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:55,774
- [grunts] Mr. Burnett--
- Never mention my pa again!

417
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,847
You're not fit
to lick his boots!

418
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:06,652
Keep your mouth shut!

419
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:11,924
I'm sor--
I'm sorry, Mr. Burnett.

420
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,700
Ah, hell.

421
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:24,269
Come on to my office later on.
We'll talk about it.

422
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,338
Okay, Mr. Burnett.

423
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,464
Well, here you go.

424
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,900
Thank you.

425
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:56,769
Thank you so much, Doctor.

426
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,071
It's a pleasure, Gladys,
and, Caleb, remember,

427
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:01,173
when you're climbing
those trees,

428
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,642
grab separate branches
with each hand.

429
00:34:03,643 --> 00:34:06,245
- Okay? You'll fall less often.
- Will do.

430
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:10,282
Are you gonna be staying
in town for a little while?

431
00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:13,152
No, I'll be heading home
soon as I get the medicine.

432
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:15,587
Yeah.

433
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:17,690
I was hoping that maybe
one of these Sundays

434
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:21,727
you could come down
and sit in church.

435
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,496
I would like that.

436
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:27,166
All right. I'll let you tend
to your duties directly here.

437
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:30,035
I don't mean to
hold you up or nothin'.

438
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:31,537
It was a pleasure.

439
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,640
No, listen, the...

440
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:37,776
the pleasure...
was all mine.

441
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:41,080
Hope to see you soon.

442
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:52,257
Take care.

443
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:56,195
Pardon me.

444
00:34:56,196 --> 00:34:57,830
Are you Dr. Morrison?

445
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,264
I am.

446
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:04,570
How can I help you?

447
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:06,638
I have a father
with a persistent fever,

448
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,040
and I really
need your help.

449
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,776
- You are?
- I'm sorry. My manners.

450
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,445
Uh, I'm Violet...
Teaster.

451
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:16,648
- Teaster, you said?
- Yes, sir.

452
00:35:16,649 --> 00:35:18,717
Where's your father at?

453
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:20,853
Back over
towards Cold...

454
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:23,088
Just a few
mountains over.

455
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,391
He was too sick
to travel, so I thought

456
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:27,993
maybe you can give me a tonic
that I could take to him.

457
00:35:27,994 --> 00:35:29,828
We can try something.

458
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:35,334
But if I can't see him, it's
hard to know what will help him.

459
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,936
Anything you can do
will be much appreciated.

460
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:40,673
I can pay.
Not much, but some.

461
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:44,943
We'll work that out.
I'm sure I have something.

462
00:35:44,944 --> 00:35:48,080
I haven't seen you
around here before, have I?

463
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:49,148
No.

464
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,752
I don't blame you.
This used to be a family town.

465
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:57,656
Now, it's gotten
worse and worse.

466
00:35:57,657 --> 00:36:00,259
I used to see
more kids like that

467
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,761
with fractured arms,
climbing trees.

468
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:06,298
Now I'm doing
mostly gunshot wounds.

469
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:09,435
I didn't see too many women and
children when I came into town.

470
00:36:09,436 --> 00:36:11,437
They're hiding.

471
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:14,473
The sheriff has no control
over what goes on here.

472
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:18,811
Drunks are running around on
the street all day and all night.

473
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:22,881
If you're traveling by yourself,
you better be careful.

474
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:24,950
I will.

475
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:28,020
Um... I'm gonna
wrap this up.

476
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,589
Do you want some...
Freshen up?

477
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:34,059
Or, uh, can I make you
something to eat? Or...

478
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,962
I'll take you up
on the freshen.

479
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:38,430
Thank you.

480
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:45,904
Are you damn sure
she said Harmon Teaster?

481
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:47,906
I'm sure as day,
Mr. Burnett.

482
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:54,279
- Leave.
- Now, Mr. Burnett...

483
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,714
Take off!

484
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:02,287
[laughing]

485
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:09,528
Yeah.

486
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:49,068
[yelling]

487
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,772
<i>[Young Victor yelling]</i>

488
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,646
Captain! Captain!

489
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:03,315
[shouting]

490
00:38:04,884 --> 00:38:06,452
[grunting]

491
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:10,489
[spits]

492
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:19,498
[gasps] Oh... Pete...

493
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:22,001
[breathing heavily]
Ain't right, Captain!

494
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:23,969
It just ain't right!

495
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,071
- It ain't right, Sheriff.
- We ought to do something.

496
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:27,906
Oh, Betsy...

497
00:38:27,907 --> 00:38:31,243
Stay here.
Both of you.

498
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,680
Let's get inside.

499
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:43,789
You got something
to say to me, Sheriff?

500
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:49,361
I reckon not.

501
00:38:49,362 --> 00:38:50,829
[Whiskey]
Captain.

502
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:56,435
Sir, Mr. Burnett's
looking all over for you.

503
00:38:56,436 --> 00:38:58,871
I was just up with him
a short time ago.

504
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:00,939
Yes, sir. Well,
he says it's important.

505
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:17,623
[sighs]

506
00:39:24,664 --> 00:39:26,398
Here, I'll take that.

507
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,400
This should keep it
safe for the journey.

508
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:31,003
Take one spoonful
every hour. Okay?

509
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:32,705
That fever
just might break.

510
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,441
Thank you so very much.
How much do I owe you?

511
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:37,509
How's a dollar sound?

512
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:41,480
Thank you, Doctor.

513
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:43,916
Bye.

514
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,825
Sorry I'm late.

515
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:54,660
I put my pa
down to bed.

516
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:57,529
What are we having
this little meeting for?

517
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,032
Maybe we're all
getting a raise.

518
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:01,967
- [laughing]
- Yeah, a raise.

519
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:03,469
[Victor]
Silence!

520
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:09,441
Some of you know that
my parents were murdered.

521
00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:12,611
As well as many of the citizens
of this town some years back.

522
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:16,749
That's right.
It was by that one Harmon Teaster fella.

523
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,283
Quiet!

524
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:20,252
- [giggling]
- [Victor] Get out of here.

525
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,092
It has just been
brought to my attention

526
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:30,496
that this man who was never
brought to justice is still alive.

527
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:34,133
And his daughter walks
these very streets as we speak.

528
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,969
[Moose] I done seen
a strange girl in town.

529
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,404
Ain't that right, Joe?

530
00:40:39,572 --> 00:40:42,007
Saw her head
into Doc's office.

531
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:44,109
Well, I want that girl
brought to me.

532
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,912
A hundred dollars to anyone
who brings her here immediately.

533
00:40:56,856 --> 00:40:58,057
[Whiskey]
Let's do it.

534
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:06,331
- You want the girl unharmed?
- For now.

535
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:17,509
Run, girl. Run fast.

536
00:41:18,678 --> 00:41:20,746
You say something
to me, General?

537
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:22,715
Hell with you, Yankee.

538
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:27,186
Not my fault you fought
on the wrong side.

539
00:41:27,187 --> 00:41:28,921
Confederate forever.

540
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:34,393
The last shot of the war rang
out right over in Waynesville.

541
00:41:35,729 --> 00:41:38,097
Confederacy's dead.

542
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:40,132
I still be hearing
the echo.

543
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:45,738
- Good day, General.
- Captain.

544
00:41:59,753 --> 00:42:02,888
- Howdy, Will.
- Hey, Tom. How you doin'?

545
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:06,258
All right.
What you working on?

546
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:09,328
Just tinkering with a few
things here and there.

547
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:14,433
Mm. Place is looking
mighty fine.

548
00:42:14,434 --> 00:42:17,002
Yeah? Thank you.
It's coming along.

549
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:19,872
So what brings you
down here?

550
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:22,574
Oh, I, uh--
I just, uh...

551
00:42:22,575 --> 00:42:26,812
come in to, uh...
reflect a little.

552
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:31,483
You need to talk
about something?

553
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:40,325
Well...I feel peculiar
talking to you about this.

554
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:43,862
That's on account
of my pa, ain't it?

555
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:51,470
Will, how can you be
such a decent, honest man

556
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:54,673
when your pa's
the way he is?

557
00:42:54,674 --> 00:42:57,042
I always account it
to the fact

558
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:59,044
that his parents
were all murdered.

559
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:00,446
Hmm...

560
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:04,550
But, uh, that don't
account for

561
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:07,553
the way he was
before they were killed.

562
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:09,188
You were there?

563
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,257
Uh! I saw enough.

564
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:16,161
I know...the truth

565
00:43:16,162 --> 00:43:19,164
about what happened
with Harmon Teaster.

566
00:43:21,334 --> 00:43:25,871
His pa was the law
around here.

567
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:28,540
And your pa...

568
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:31,377
had done gotten himself
into some bad trouble.

569
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:33,579
What kind
of trouble?

570
00:43:35,982 --> 00:43:37,516
[exhales]

571
00:43:41,321 --> 00:43:42,721
Well, Will...

572
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:47,626
He got drunk on shine
and killed some Indian boy.

573
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:52,531
And, uh,
Harmon Teaster's pa, Ransom,

574
00:43:52,532 --> 00:43:54,967
he was dead set

575
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:58,137
on having your pa stand trial
for what he'd done.

576
00:43:59,372 --> 00:44:03,942
Then your granddaddy,
Big John Burnett,

577
00:44:03,943 --> 00:44:07,012
wickedly set his men
upon Ransom Teaster.

578
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:10,482
The whole town
saw what happened.

579
00:44:12,585 --> 00:44:14,920
No man should have
suffered that way.

580
00:44:16,456 --> 00:44:20,793
And Harmon Teaster witnessed
that merciless killing

581
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:22,795
from a jail cell window.

582
00:44:24,064 --> 00:44:26,265
Somehow he escaped,

583
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:30,569
and when he came back
a few nights later...

584
00:44:31,738 --> 00:44:35,074
he brought down
a vengeance on your family

585
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:37,343
and all the men
responsible

586
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:40,879
that is legendary
in its violence.

587
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,983
I mean, he made this town
into a ghost town.

588
00:44:46,586 --> 00:44:50,022
I never heard the part
about the lawman before.

589
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:54,226
Well, I reckon... they left
some of the facts out.

590
00:44:54,227 --> 00:44:56,895
Reckon so.

591
00:44:56,896 --> 00:45:00,299
Now, your pa was hell-bent
on striking back.

592
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,268
But all the Burnett
gun hands were dead.

593
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:10,275
So he went around to other towns and
raised a small army of cutthroats.

594
00:45:10,276 --> 00:45:14,079
They started out
looking for Harmon Teaster.

595
00:45:15,982 --> 00:45:18,484
Never found him.

596
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:20,586
Now, legend says
that he hid himself out

597
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:23,689
in some mountain den
for years.

598
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,924
Others say he took in
with the Cherokee.

599
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:29,495
Don't you think that
he'd be dead by now?

600
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:30,763
May be.

601
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:35,534
But secrets
don't always stay buried.

602
00:45:38,505 --> 00:45:40,406
Will...

603
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:45,010
this town is as bad now
as it ever was.

604
00:45:45,011 --> 00:45:46,845
Maybe worse.

605
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:50,249
Now, I know
I should do something.

606
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:57,322
But I saw what they did
to that other lawman...

607
00:45:57,323 --> 00:45:58,557
Ransom Teaster...

608
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:07,599
I'm afraid.

609
00:46:08,968 --> 00:46:10,969
Tom, if you're afraid,

610
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:14,006
why don't you just leave?

611
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:16,675
Oh, I can run
from different places,

612
00:46:18,078 --> 00:46:20,412
but I can't run
from myself.

613
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:25,217
Your pa and his boys
are getting way out of hand.

614
00:46:25,218 --> 00:46:28,020
The people of this town
are looking for help.

615
00:46:29,823 --> 00:46:31,757
What are you gonna do?

616
00:46:36,629 --> 00:46:39,631
I have no clear path
in sight.

617
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:42,701
So... I come to pray.

618
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:49,441
I know it's been
a long time, but...

619
00:46:49,442 --> 00:46:53,679
maybe He'll still listen
to an old man with a badge

620
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,614
seeking to do
the right thing.

621
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:03,422
Well, Tom, I'm gonna
let you sit here and reflect.

622
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:06,959
- Thanks, Will.
- No. Thank you.

623
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:27,379
Almighty God...

624
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,017
hear my prayer.

625
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:37,890
Do you have
an appointment?

626
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:39,425
No.

627
00:47:39,426 --> 00:47:41,660
We're looking for a little lady
that was seen coming in here.

628
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:43,128
She still here, Doc?

629
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:48,000
Excuse me. I have
sensitive materials here.

630
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:51,537
Sensitive?
Sensitive materials...

631
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:53,238
for a sensitive man.

632
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:58,444
I'm getting real sensitive
about finding this girl, Doc.

633
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:01,547
Hell, Bobcat,
that ain't the right word.

634
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:04,717
[Dr. Morrison chuckles]
She's not here.

635
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,785
[Whiskey] She was here.
She ain't here now.

636
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:13,225
Doc, you wouldn't be keeping that
woman to yourself now, would you?

637
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:15,461
We need to go check
your living quarters?

638
00:48:17,697 --> 00:48:22,601
We'll see how you all like it the
next time I have to sew you up.

639
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:25,137
You're always
getting out-drawn.

640
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:28,407
How you gonna like it when
I have a needle and thread,

641
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:31,877
when I gotta take
some lead out of your ass?

642
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:35,714
What are you saying, Doc?

643
00:48:35,715 --> 00:48:38,350
[Jim Dandy]
Doc's right, Bobcat.

644
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:41,553
We haven't seen you hit anything
you was aiming at in a long time.

645
00:48:41,554 --> 00:48:44,590
[laughing]

646
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,159
Doc's sewn you up
at least a half dozen times.

647
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,361
[laughing]

648
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:57,403
See what I mean?

649
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:03,642
You'd be having Doc pick lead from
you if Digger didn't get to you first.

650
00:49:03,643 --> 00:49:05,611
Hell, he's just telling
some truth.

651
00:49:08,014 --> 00:49:10,416
Doc's kept you from bleeding
to death on many occasion.

652
00:49:11,484 --> 00:49:13,052
All right, boys.

653
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:15,320
Just tell us where
the lady is, Doc.

654
00:49:15,321 --> 00:49:17,089
I honestly
don't know.

655
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,125
Hell, she's got to be
in town somewhere.

656
00:49:20,126 --> 00:49:21,694
Let's go, boys.

657
00:49:21,695 --> 00:49:23,829
- You, too, Little Jack.
- [blows a kiss]

658
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:32,471
I ain't
been shot yet.

659
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,240
No hard feelings.

660
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:46,885
This is unreasonable.

661
00:49:46,886 --> 00:49:50,322
How can we run a business
when people don't pay?

662
00:49:50,323 --> 00:49:51,957
[Pete]
I'll talk to Victor.

663
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:55,327
- Victor?
- He's harsh, I know.

664
00:49:55,328 --> 00:49:57,529
But he's also
a businessman.

665
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,031
He'll listen to reason.

666
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,133
That Yankee mercenary
working for him

667
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,634
shows no respect.

668
00:50:02,635 --> 00:50:04,837
For anybody
or anything!

669
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:07,539
Pa, are we
gonna be okay?

670
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,274
You mind your chores, boy.

671
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:12,011
Shh. We have customers.

672
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:15,681
[Betsy Mae] I'm terribly sorry.
Can I help you find anything?

673
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:18,650
[Violet] I'm picking up
a few little things.

674
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:21,820
This is amazing that you
have all this in one place.

675
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:23,822
You've never been
to a general store?

676
00:50:23,823 --> 00:50:25,190
No.

677
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:28,227
My uncle and pa took me
to a trappers' gathering once,

678
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:30,729
but it was nothing
like this.

679
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:34,166
Pa? I think we got trouble.

680
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,644
So this is where
you've been hiding.

681
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,919
This horse is a nag.

682
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,520
You ought to let me
pick you a good horse.

683
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:00,993
I just wanted to wish you
a happy birthday, son.

684
00:51:00,994 --> 00:51:03,062
Thank you.

685
00:51:04,397 --> 00:51:06,432
I've had a half dozen people
out trying to find you

686
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:08,901
so I could have
a word with you today.

687
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,571
I don't know why
you defy me so.

688
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:18,177
Isn't there something in that Good
Book about respecting thy father?

689
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,282
You trying to tell me now
that you've read the Good Book?

690
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:26,518
I've read a line
or two here and there.

691
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:28,787
I know we don't always
see eye to eye

692
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:31,357
and I may not be
the ideal parent,

693
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:34,860
but I've always tried to provide
and help make you into a man.

694
00:51:34,861 --> 00:51:37,830
Yeah. You've helped me decide what
kind of man I never want to be.

695
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:40,432
[laughing]
Will!

696
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:44,703
These people don't respond to
all that religious guilt bullshit.

697
00:51:44,704 --> 00:51:47,806
They need authority from
someone who can give punishment.

698
00:51:47,807 --> 00:51:50,709
Direct punishment
and reward.

699
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,145
You sound like you're
trying to fill in for God.

700
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:55,547
- Is that what you're trying to do?
- Enough!

701
00:51:57,517 --> 00:52:00,519
I'm having a gathering
tonight at the Silver Dollar,

702
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,021
in your honor.

703
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:05,958
And I have a surprise
or two for you.

704
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:08,761
That church bell you've been
wanting is one of them.

705
00:52:10,163 --> 00:52:11,430
I'm not demanding.

706
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:15,634
I'm asking my son
to please come tonight.

707
00:52:17,037 --> 00:52:19,872
Let's have just one night

708
00:52:19,873 --> 00:52:23,575
where we could put our differences
aside and be father and son.

709
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,614
Let's do it for your mother.

710
00:52:28,615 --> 00:52:31,016
I know she would
have wanted that.

711
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:32,351
Agreed?

712
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:39,291
All right. Agreed.

713
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:43,062
- I'll be there.
- Great! Great.

714
00:52:43,063 --> 00:52:46,699
Six o'clock to whenever.
We'll have a grand old time.

715
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,802
- Need new clothes or anything?
- No, I'm good. Thank you.

716
00:52:49,803 --> 00:52:51,770
I'll see you
in a few hours, then.

717
00:52:52,939 --> 00:52:55,107
- You best get cleaned up.
- I will.

718
00:53:01,948 --> 00:53:04,750
Sure is pretty.
[cackling]

719
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:06,819
Like an unplucked flair.

720
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:12,224
- I need to be going now.
- She ain't goin' no-damn-where.

721
00:53:12,225 --> 00:53:14,860
- [Jim Dandy] Nope.
- What's going on here?

722
00:53:14,861 --> 00:53:17,429
- Let the girl go on her way!
- Shush, Betsy.

723
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,765
[Captain] I can see
this is gonna be difficult.

724
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:21,600
- Whiskey. Moose.
- [Moose] Let's go.

725
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:24,269
- [laughing]
- [Violet shrieking]

726
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:29,108
- [Violet whimpering]
- [Bobcat cackling]

727
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:34,747
Take her to my office
and watch her.

728
00:53:34,748 --> 00:53:36,782
She gets away, I'm holding you
all personally responsible.

729
00:53:36,783 --> 00:53:38,817
She ain't goin' nowhere,
Mr. Burnett.

730
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:42,755
[Victor, Jim Dandy laughing]

731
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:47,259
Makes you feel like
a little kid again.

732
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,095
[Mayor] Victor!
Hold on, fellas.

733
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:52,398
You mind telling me
what's going on out here?

734
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:54,400
A bit of family business.

735
00:53:54,401 --> 00:53:56,835
Victor. Now you
got to understand.

736
00:53:56,836 --> 00:54:00,706
It does not look good for people to
be dragged off the streets of this town

737
00:54:00,707 --> 00:54:02,775
in the middle
of broad daylight like that.

738
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:08,113
[spitting] And it's bad for politicians
to be messin' with other folks' business.

739
00:54:08,114 --> 00:54:11,583
There are still laws
in this town, Mr. Burnett.

740
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:14,319
Let's all
just take it easy.

741
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,156
Mr. Burnett, sir, what right
do you have to take that girl?

742
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:19,425
- What right?
- [grunting]

743
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:22,928
- [blows landing]
- [Deputy Tuck grunting]

744
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:26,498
You're trying to create
a job vacancy real fast.

745
00:54:26,499 --> 00:54:29,468
Digger would be happy to box you and
your amigo up, if that's what you want.

746
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:32,771
That girl's pa
murdered my family.

747
00:54:32,772 --> 00:54:35,407
In my book,
that gives me every right.

748
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:38,143
And if any of you
even question my actions again,

749
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:42,614
or get between me and
my business, I'll bury you!

750
00:54:42,615 --> 00:54:45,217
- You understand?
- All right, now, Victor--

751
00:54:45,218 --> 00:54:48,554
- Get the hell out of here.
- Victor...

752
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:50,189
W-We're stepping away.

753
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,091
[Mayor]
Stepping away right now.

754
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:53,826
Copperhead!
Copperhead, come on!

755
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,163
Come on!

756
00:55:24,758 --> 00:55:26,258
Harmon.

757
00:55:26,259 --> 00:55:28,193
Wake up.

758
00:55:32,532 --> 00:55:35,100
Susie?

759
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:37,136
I do not have long, my love.

760
00:55:37,137 --> 00:55:38,971
[whimpers]

761
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:43,575
You will be faced
with a serious choice

762
00:55:43,576 --> 00:55:46,679
that has serious consequences
attached to it.

763
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,215
How will I know what to do?

764
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:56,388
I shot those men dead,

765
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:59,158
chopped 'em in the head
with a ax.

766
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:01,660
And then I shot
that poor old woman dead.

767
00:56:01,661 --> 00:56:04,496
Huh.

768
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:07,232
- How can I do anything any worse?
- Shh!

769
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:10,636
I know what you did
and why you did it.

770
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:20,579
- Hold on, old friend.
- [groaning]

771
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,681
Everything will be okay.

772
00:56:31,057 --> 00:56:32,958
[groaning continues]

773
00:56:43,036 --> 00:56:44,870
[groaning continues]

774
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:05,391
[thunderclap]

775
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:10,429
Violet?

776
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,765
Where the hell are you?

777
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:18,103
Very strong.

778
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:20,305
You put in his drink,

779
00:57:20,306 --> 00:57:22,808
and he will be...

780
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:26,045
How you say?

781
00:57:26,046 --> 00:57:28,313
More relaxed.

782
00:57:28,314 --> 00:57:31,083
Much more relaxed.

783
00:57:31,084 --> 00:57:35,587
Influence will be
much more easy.

784
00:57:35,588 --> 00:57:37,890
Hmm.

785
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:39,858
Thank you.

786
00:57:45,899 --> 00:57:47,266
Who's she?

787
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:55,140
That, my dear...

788
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:59,244
is the daughter of the man
who murdered my family.

789
00:57:59,245 --> 00:58:02,581

790
00:58:09,956 --> 00:58:12,791
- [whimpering]
- And he's still alive, isn't he?

791
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:18,364
After all these years,
he's alive.

792
00:58:18,365 --> 00:58:22,401
He's sent himself away like
a coward after what he did.

793
00:58:22,402 --> 00:58:24,737
- [whimpering]
- Well, I intend to find him.

794
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:30,075
And you, my dear,
are going to tell me where.

795
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:34,346
Now...

796
00:58:34,347 --> 00:58:38,350
I must go downstairs
to greet our guests.

797
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:41,186
And, honestly,

798
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:43,956
I don't trust anyone else
to watch over you,

799
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:46,425
save the good captain here,

800
00:58:46,426 --> 00:58:50,129
because I pay him very well.

801
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,264
Captain,

802
00:58:52,265 --> 00:58:54,767
please help yourself
to any of the brandy.

803
00:58:54,768 --> 00:58:56,301
I'll be back shortly.

804
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:04,343
Birthday. Oh, it's sure
a good reason for a drink.

805
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:06,245
[laughs]

806
00:59:06,246 --> 00:59:09,648
Dandy with all diamonds.

807
00:59:09,649 --> 00:59:11,917
That's twice, Mr. Walters.

808
00:59:11,918 --> 00:59:14,920
[laughs]
