and I got no complaints.

171
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:32,940
He's put food in my belly
and a roof over my head

172
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,626
ever since we hopped the twig.

173
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,612
And he never raised
a hand to me but twice,

174
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,748
and both times,
he had liquor on him,

175
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,385
and he done it all
with charitable words

176
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,471
and a lovesick smile.

177

I probably deserved it.

him raise a hand to you.

but a kiss...

And one of the first thing
he done when got there

was cleanse the temple.

You're serious.

501
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,262
I didn't know
he was your foreman.

502
00:31:34,313 --> 00:31:37,966
But I wouldn't have acted
differently had I known.

503
00:31:38,017 --> 00:31:40,318
Thomas, he was a murderer.

504
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:44,156
Under whose authority
did you take this action,

505
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,074
Mrs. Bell?

506
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:48,810
It was justice.

507
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:52,581
So... You became

508
00:31:52,648 --> 00:31:56,317
judge, jury and executioner.

509
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:58,620
As you are doing
with Mr. McGinnes.

510
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:02,323
After all I've done for you.

511
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:05,260
[Chuckles] You...

512
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:07,846
Usurped my authority,

513
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,681
put my railroad at risk,

514
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:12,851
killed one of my most
valuable employees,

515
00:32:12,935 --> 00:32:16,337
and you dare to claim
that it was justice!

516
00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:19,524
It was justice!
An innocent man is going to hang!

517
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,360
Someone has to hang!

518
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:24,396
Perhaps you would like
to take their place

519
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,033
in the interests of justice.

520
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,549
You lookin' for this?

521
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:49,704
She's an old piece.

522
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:53,091
But she still shoots true, huh?

523
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,712
Very flattering.

524
00:32:58,714 --> 00:33:01,066
It was you
agitating the Germans

525
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,734
to hang the McGinnes boys.

526
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:05,720
Payback for the tar
and feathers, I guess?

527
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:07,055
No, no, not true.

528
00:33:07,106 --> 00:33:10,058
Any dispute between the celts

529
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:11,993
and my nordic brethren,

530
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:14,863
I must side with my brethren.

531
00:33:14,914 --> 00:33:17,065
And like them, I--

532
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:20,452
I despise the Irish.

533
00:33:21,737 --> 00:33:25,240
See...

534
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:28,710
I got this idea.

535
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:32,764
You hate pretty much everybody.

536
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:35,517
Especially yourself.

537
00:33:35,584 --> 00:33:40,805
Yes, that is where we are
similar, Mr. Bohannon.

538
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:45,393
But I hate you

539
00:33:45,444 --> 00:33:48,864
more than you hate yourself.

540
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:54,986
You keep agitating trouble
on this railroad...

541
00:33:55,071 --> 00:33:59,207
You're going to a deep sleep
at the bottom of your muck pile.

542
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:02,794
There won't be nobody
to mourn or miss you, either.

543
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:06,715
You will miss me,
Mr. Bohannon.

544
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:10,552
Yeah.

545
00:34:11,637 --> 00:34:14,723
Will you so kind
as to replace my weapon?

546
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,925
Oh.

547
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:19,010
Yeah.

548
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,231
Fa!

549
00:34:33,223 --> 00:34:36,659
You should leave this place.

550
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:38,778
Return to your people.

551
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:40,996
I don't have
any people anymore.

552
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:42,665
Thanks to you.

553
00:34:45,068 --> 00:34:47,420
I know.

554
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,922
I know it's--
It's all my fault.

555
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:53,125
But that's why
you can't stay here.

556
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,930
You can't tell me what
I can and can't do anymore.

557
00:34:58,014 --> 00:34:59,581
I believed in you.

558
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:02,218
And everything
you told me was a lie.

559

Jesus can't bring peace
to these people!

560
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,523
And all they want
to do is kill.

561
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,259
Kill my people,
kill each other,

562
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,194
ah, kill everything!

563
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:15,698
But that's-- that's why
you can't stay here.

564
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,733
I love your daughter.

565
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:19,985
I'm not going to abandon her.

566

Mr. Bohannon.

579
00:36:14,991 --> 00:36:18,177
Mr. durant just decided
to let the brothers go.

580
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,296
All by his self
he decided that?

581
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:21,847
Yes.

582
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:23,966
Why did he send you
to tell me, then?

583
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:26,185
He didn't.
I volunteered.

584
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:29,188
Really? What's
your stake in this?

585

I think they're innocent.

[Train whistle]

588

Mr. Bohannon, go
and set them free.

589
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:48,374
All right, then.

590
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,492
But hanging might have
been merciful

591
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:52,494
compared to what that Kraut
butcher is going to do to them.

592
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:55,631
And you'll protect
them, won't you?

593
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:59,919
It ain't my job to protect 'em.
