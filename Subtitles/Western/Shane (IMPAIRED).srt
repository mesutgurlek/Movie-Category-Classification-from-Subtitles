1060
01:44:19,419 --> 01:44:21,963
He'll be all right.

1061
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:26,926
No one can blame him
for not keeping that date.

1062
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:30,721
Shane, wait.

1063
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:39,647
- You were through with gunfighting.
- I changed my mind.

1064
01:44:40,649 --> 01:44:43,484
Are you doing this just for me?

1065
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:46,362
For you, Marian...

1066
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:49,824
...and Joe and little Joe.

1067
01:44:52,911 --> 01:44:56,163
Then we'll never see you again?

1068
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:59,375
Never's a long time, Marian.

1069
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:04,255
Tell him...
Tell him I was sorry.

1070
01:45:04,923 --> 01:45:08,009
No need to tell him that.

1071
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:11,512
Please, Shane.

1072
01:45:14,016 --> 01:45:16,142
JOEY:
Mother.

1073
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:22,940
Please.

1074
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,406
Take care of yourself.

1075
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:47,840
Mother. Pa's coming along all right.

1076
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,470
Yes, Joey.

1077
01:45:52,637 --> 01:45:56,807
- Why did Shane?
- Shane did what he had to do.

1078
01:45:56,975 --> 01:46:01,562
- You don't hate Shane.
- I know, Mother.

1079
01:46:04,941 --> 01:46:07,026
Shane.

1080
01:46:08,236 --> 01:46:10,738
I'm sorry.

1081
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:14,700
He didn't hear you.

1082
01:46:22,918 --> 01:46:24,752
Shane!

1083
01:46:28,715 --> 01:46:31,550
Shane! I'm sorry!

1084
01:46:31,718 --> 01:46:33,719
[BARKING]

1085
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:52,853
I came to get your offer, Ryker.

1086
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:57,358
RUFUS: I'm not dealing with you.
Where's Starrett?

1087
01:50:57,525 --> 01:51:02,946
SHANE: You're dealing with me, Ryker.
- I got no quarrel with you, Shane.

1088
01:51:03,114 --> 01:51:06,492
You can walk out now
and no hard feeling.

1089
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:10,788
- What's your offer, Ryker?
RUFUS: To you, not a thing.

1090
01:51:10,955 --> 01:51:14,875
SHANE: That's too bad.
RUFUS: Too bad.

1091
01:51:15,043 --> 01:51:20,047
You've lived too long.
Your kind of days are over.

1092
01:51:20,215 --> 01:51:25,302
- My days? And yours, gunfighter?
- The difference is I know it.

1093
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:29,306
RUFUS: So we'll turn in our six-guns
to the bartender...

1094
01:51:29,474 --> 01:51:33,560
...and we'll all start hoeing spuds,
is that it?

1095
01:51:33,728 --> 01:51:36,230
Not quite yet.

1096
01:51:37,732 --> 01:51:41,402
We haven't heard from your friend here.

1097
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:52,788
I wouldn't push too far if I were you.

1098
01:52:14,936 --> 01:52:17,896
Our fight ain't with you.

1099
01:52:19,107 --> 01:52:23,986
- It ain't with me, Wilson?
- No, it ain't, Shane.

1100
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:27,573
I wouldn't pull on Wilson, Shane.

1101
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:30,826
Will, you're a witness to this.

1102
01:52:32,287 --> 01:52:36,123
So you're Jack Wilson.

1103
01:52:36,332 --> 01:52:39,126
What's that mean to you, Shane?

1104
01:52:39,294 --> 01:52:42,171
I've heard about you.

1105
01:52:43,882 --> 01:52:46,967
What have you heard, Shane?

1106
01:52:55,977 --> 01:52:59,897
I've heard that you're
a low-down, Yankee liar.

1107
01:53:08,323 --> 01:53:10,157
Prove it.

1108
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:43,440
Shane, look out!

1109
01:54:19,143 --> 01:54:21,019
Shane.

1110
01:54:22,188 --> 01:54:27,734
I knew you could, Shane.
I knew it just as well as anything.

1111
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:31,196
Was that him? Was that Wilson?

1112
01:54:31,364 --> 01:54:36,326
That was him.
That was Wilson, all right.

1113
01:54:36,494 --> 01:54:40,706
He was fast, fast on the draw.

1114
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:44,668
Joey, what are you doing here?

1115
01:54:46,254 --> 01:54:51,425
- I'm sorry, Shane.
- You don't have to be.

1116
01:54:51,593 --> 01:54:56,597
- You'd better run back.
- Can't I ride home behind you?

1117
01:54:58,099 --> 01:55:00,684
I'm afraid not, Joey.

1118
01:55:00,852 --> 01:55:04,021
Please. Why not?

1119
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:08,275
I gotta be going on.

1120
01:55:09,402 --> 01:55:12,279
Why, Shane?

1121
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:18,076
A man has to be what he is, Joey.
Can't break the mold.

1122
01:55:20,038 --> 01:55:25,500
- I tried it and it didn't work for me.
- We want you, Shane.

1123
01:55:27,128 --> 01:55:33,425
Joey, there's no living with a killing.
There's no going back from one.

1124
01:55:33,593 --> 01:55:37,471
Right or wrong, it's a brand.
A brand sticks.

1125
01:55:39,432 --> 01:55:42,100
There's no going back.

1126
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:45,896
Now you run on home to your mother,
and tell her...

1127
01:55:46,064 --> 01:55:52,027
Tell her everything's all right
and there aren't any more guns in the valley.

1128
01:55:52,195 --> 01:55:53,987
Shane.

1129
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:58,325
It's bloody. You're hurt.

1130
01:56:01,663 --> 01:56:04,623
I'm all right, Joey.

1131
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:11,672
Go home to your mother and father
and grow up to be strong and straight.

1132
01:56:14,092 --> 01:56:16,134
And, Joey...

1133
01:56:16,302 --> 01:56:20,681
...take care of them, both of them.

1134
01:56:25,478 --> 01:56:27,354
Yes, Shane.

1135
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:43,120
He'd never have shot you
if you'd seen him!

1136
01:56:43,287 --> 01:56:45,205
Bye, little Joe.

1137
01:56:48,793 --> 01:56:53,380
He'd never even have cleared
the holster, would he, Shane?

1138
01:57:02,724 --> 01:57:09,396
Pa's got things for you to do!
And Mother wants you!

1139
01:57:09,605 --> 01:57:12,107
I know she does!

1140
01:57:13,234 --> 01:57:24,995
Shane!

1141
01:57:26,664 --> 01:57:28,749
Come back!

1142
01:57:40,303 --> 01:57:42,888
Bye, Shane!
