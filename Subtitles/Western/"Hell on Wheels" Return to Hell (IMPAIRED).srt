Hey, open the door!

Open them. Jesus.

170
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,556
Somebody grab them guns before they go off!

171
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,642
It was him. It was Sidney Snow.

172

Mickey!

173
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,513
Organize a bucket brigade before
the whole damn town goes up.

174
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:55,983
Aye. Right, lads!

175
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:59,436
Every Irish, negro, cowboy and kraut!

176
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:01,488
You grab yourselves a bucket!

177
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:06,243
Let's save this town!

178
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,412
Mr. Bohannon, I'm over here!

179
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,364
If you value me service at all,

180
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:14,618
get a message to me
sweetheart in Lisdoonvarna.

[Coughing]

182
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,292
Tell her go on and marry
that bollocks Doherty.

183
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:25,295
Far be it from me to make her an old maid.

184
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:27,297
Shut up, Paddy.

185
00:14:27,349 --> 00:14:29,049
You can write her yourself tomorrow.

186
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,550
I can't read, sir.

187
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:31,802
Can't help you there.

188

Keep 'em coming.

193
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,738
Pass the bucket. Come on.

194
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,991
Quickly lads!

195
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:56,827
Come on, get this fire out!

Keep 'em coming!

Come on, faster, faster.
Come on, move it out.

198
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:03,467
All right, boys, pick it up!

199
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,860
It's always good doin' business 
with a fellow pioneer, Mr. Young.

200
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:57,483
Please, thank all of your wives
for the heartiest hospitality

201
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:59,592
I have felt on either
side of the Mississippi.

202
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:01,785
We'll make a Saint of you yet,
Mr. Huntington.

203
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,870
I will pray for your safe
return to Sacramento.

204
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:08,154
And I will hope for your continued
health and prosperity.

205
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,660
Oh, uh... mister, uh...

206
00:16:10,713 --> 00:16:12,796
Gundersen, was it?

207
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:16,216
That name is Norwegian if I'm not mistaken.

208
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,002
You are not mistaken.

209
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:23,807
Why did you want to know what
kind of feed I give my chinamen?

210
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:32,766
Our guest asked you a question,
brother Gundersen.

211
00:16:32,818 --> 00:16:36,019
I learned during the war

212
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:39,072
that an army runs on its stomach,

213
00:16:39,108 --> 00:16:44,327
and what is a labor force
if not a small army?

214
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:46,747
I see.

215
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,925
Thank you.

216
00:16:47,951 --> 00:16:50,617
I spent years on the Union Pacific Railroad

217
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:51,701
under Thomas Durant.

218
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,703
Oh, that old son of a gun?

219
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,872
He ever give you that damn speech of his

220
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:58,041
- about the lion and the zebra?
- Oh, many times, yes.

221
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:00,177
Oh! 'Bout turned me into rip van winkle.

222
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:02,629
Because you found it boring?

223
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:04,097
[Laughs]

224
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:06,133
Tell me, did you ever have the opportunity

225
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,517
to work with Cullen Bohannon?

226
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,894
That man impresses the hell out of me.

227
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,439
Everything I know,

228
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:17,027
I learned by careful
study of Cullen Bohannon.

229
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:18,862
How about that?

230
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:21,364
And I suppose I'll see him
on the downslope soon enough.

231
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,317
Perhaps you could use a
former Union Pacific man

232
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:30,157
to accompany your fresh mormon workers.

233
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:31,491
That is,

234
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:36,546
if brother Brigham can spare me.

235
00:17:36,582 --> 00:17:37,881
We will discuss it.

236
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,299
Hmm.

237
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,384
Leave us, Gundersen.

238
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,636
Good day.

239
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:04,107
You. Remember me?

240
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,360
You no good trash.

241
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:13,116
Help... me...

242
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:17,037
Look at me.

243
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:19,873
Look at me!

244
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,925
My name is Eva.

245

I'm a mother, daughter, injun,

246
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:28,798

247

But all my time on this earth,

248

I ain't ever met a bigger
piece of shit than you.

He couldn't be saved.

250
00:19:12,394 --> 00:19:14,728
Have you seen Ezra?

251
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:17,147
I-I'm sorry, I haven't.

252
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:21,568
Ezra hasn't come back.

253
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:23,853
I'll be over after a while.

254
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:26,856
He's never stayed out all night.

255
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:28,608
All right. Hey, listen.

256
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,361
H... h...
he run off before all this started.

257
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:34,080
- He's all right. 
- But... but where is he?

258
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:35,198
Probably just tryin' to stay out of the way.

259

We'll find him.

- Ezra! 
- Ezra!

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,869
- Come on out, now!
- Ezra!

262

Have you not seen him, Ruth?

Oh, you know how boys are.

00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:45,747
- He's just hidin' somewheres.
- Ezra!

Ezra!

- I won't be cross! 
- Ezra!

No, church was clear.

orders from anyone.

Whoa! A child is dead!

I swear to you before God.

289

I had nothin' to do with the
heinous crimes at the church.

You hired that son of bitch
when you should have hung him.

You're right.

You're right.

The blame for last night's tragedy is mine.

I never should have empowered Sidney Snow.

I'd like to offer every
resource at my disposal

to help you find him and see him hang.

You're all out of resources,
far as I can tell.

Campbell didn't know.

302

We searched the casino,
the whorehouse, the laundry.

- You seen him?
- Mm-mm.

309
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:55,112
There are a lot of rotten,
mangy dogs in this town,

310
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:57,665
but none who'd shelter a child-killer.

311
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:01,786
All he had to was hop on a horse.

312
00:24:01,838 --> 00:24:03,871
He's halfway to Mexico by now,

313
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:06,424
or some other arsehole town in this world!

314
00:24:06,459 --> 00:24:08,793
He ain't in Mexico.

He's gone.

It's over.

318
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:35,870
I had him, Mickey.

00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:46,275
In the general store.

320
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:53,796
Had my gun to his head.

321
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,257
Well, why didn't you shoot him?

322
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:20,742
Ruth...

323
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:28,289
We searched everywheres...

324
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:30,591
And I was too slow.

325
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:32,638
Stupid.

326
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:39,600
I let Sidney get away.

327
00:25:45,057 --> 00:25:48,309
When you first brought him to the church,

328
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:53,030
I wanted to send him to the orphanage.

329
00:25:53,065 --> 00:25:56,650
I had no business being anyone's mother.

330
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,334
You was just scared.

331
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:19,590
I never learned his full name.

332
00:26:19,642 --> 00:26:23,260
Never knew where he came from.

333
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:28,599
Whether he had brothers or sisters
