to have a child with a drunk...

I wrote you about it

385

387

It whimpered louder and louder

Get rid of your guns.

It's gonna be
all right.

525
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:00,846
Keep your hands up
and your fingers spread.

You'll have a fair trial.

527
01:23:05,185 --> 01:23:08,020
Let's get out
of this place.

528

Together.

529
01:23:09,756 --> 01:23:11,658
You know you won't get
away from here alive.

530
01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:15,427
The city...
with the tall houses,

531
01:23:15,428 --> 01:23:17,529
with the streetlamps.

[sobbing]

535

Yeah. It could work.

Yeah!

537
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:34,179
[sobs]
It could work!

538
01:23:37,917 --> 01:23:40,953
[Sheriff]
You are finished.

539
01:23:40,954 --> 01:23:43,655
Give it up!

540
01:23:43,656 --> 01:23:45,357
Promise!

541
01:23:45,358 --> 01:23:49,328
I'm gonna count to three.

542
01:23:49,329 --> 01:23:51,163
Hold this.

543
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:53,232
Hell no!
I ain't no deputy.

544
01:24:00,407 --> 01:24:02,975
What's wrong with you?

545
01:24:02,976 --> 01:24:05,444
Are you sick or what?

546
01:24:27,801 --> 01:24:31,603
[no audible gunshots]

01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:41,980
[audio fades in]

548

Don't touch me!

[gunshot]

550
01:25:16,116 --> 01:25:20,319
Did you ever...

551
01:25:23,757 --> 01:25:27,893
He took the wedding ring
off my hand before.

552
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:38,270
The tears I cried...

553
01:25:42,509 --> 01:25:45,277
he thought it was the rain.

554
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:53,786
Simply a whore.

555
01:26:00,427 --> 01:26:02,995
Not a profession.

556
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:04,997
A position.

557
01:26:58,051 --> 01:26:59,151
[coughing]

558
01:26:59,152 --> 01:27:00,552
Major.

[coughs]

560
01:27:04,924 --> 01:27:06,925
Hard day?

561
01:27:09,162 --> 01:27:10,863
Hard life.

562
01:27:10,864 --> 01:27:12,898

567
01:28:59,839 --> 01:29:01,740
Could I fix you once more?

568
01:29:03,009 --> 01:29:05,344
No, thanks.

569
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:06,812
I just had one.

570
01:29:14,521 --> 01:29:17,256
Is there any
special way?

571
01:29:17,257 --> 01:29:18,691
Oh, no.

572
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:21,894
Whatever you say.

573
01:29:34,674 --> 01:29:36,342
And then?

574
01:29:50,623 --> 01:29:52,257
And then...

575
01:29:52,258 --> 01:29:54,626
we'll live in the...

576
01:29:54,627 --> 01:29:56,195
big city.

01:30:13,313 --> 01:30:15,347
