00:37:15,028 --> 00:37:17,497
because I'm afraid of what...
of what I might do to them.

649
00:37:17,598 --> 00:37:19,165
Oh.

650
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:21,401
Listen, baby.

651
00:37:21,502 --> 00:37:23,936
Baby. [ Sobs ]

652
00:37:24,037 --> 00:37:25,605
You're supposed to
fall in love, and you...

653
00:37:25,706 --> 00:37:28,941
[ crying ] I thought
I was in love before, mom.

654
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:32,011
But I-I couldn't even kiss her!

655
00:37:32,112 --> 00:37:33,946
And I didn't know
how to explain that to her,

656
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:36,449
so I-I...

657
00:37:36,517 --> 00:37:38,117
I don't know.
She got frustrated.

658
00:37:38,218 --> 00:37:41,754
And she started dating
one of my friends.

659
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:46,526
That's when I made up my mind.

660
00:37:46,593 --> 00:37:50,163
How did you find out
Ross Lanten was your father?

661
00:37:51,532 --> 00:37:52,965
The... the registrar's office.

662
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:55,501
I-I, um...

663
00:37:55,602 --> 00:38:00,373
I broke in one day, and...

664
00:38:00,441 --> 00:38:02,375
You know, I just had to see
my birth certificate, you know?

665
00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:05,545
Just... just look at it.

666
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:08,581
[ Chuckles ] And his name
was just written right there.

667
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:13,152
So you made a plan to kill him?

668
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:17,957
What? N-n-no. No. I...

669
00:38:18,058 --> 00:38:20,092
Not exactly. I...

670
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,697
Dacus.
You took your mother's gun.

671
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:31,637
I-I had to see whether or not
he deserved to live.

672
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:34,140
After our shift,
he was asking around

673
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:36,509
for a ride to the truck stop.

674
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,078
"Beers and broads."

675
00:38:39,179 --> 00:38:41,948
So, I told him I'd drive him,

676
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:46,185
and he gave me all this shit
for not wanting to get laid.

677
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:53,493
Later, he took off
with this hooker.

678
00:38:53,594 --> 00:38:56,028
And I waited.

679
00:38:56,096 --> 00:39:00,833
And when I saw
the look on his face

680
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:03,503
after he left the men's room,
I-I knew.

681
00:39:12,446 --> 00:39:14,814
Trust me... she liked it.

682
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:20,720
The more that he talked,
the angrier I got.

683
00:39:23,257 --> 00:39:27,894
I told myself, "if he says the
word 'bitch' one more time..."

684
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,964
I couldn't let him live.

685
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:33,132
[ Gun cocks ]

686
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,835
[ Tires screech, gunshot ]

687
00:39:35,903 --> 00:39:37,169
[ Grunting ]

688
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:40,473
Dacus: Then I had to
make him disappear.

689
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:41,841
Come on.

690
00:39:41,909 --> 00:39:44,544
That's why I hid him
in mom's compost pile,

691
00:39:44,645 --> 00:39:47,914
because I thought
nobody would ever find him.

692
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:53,619
I-I just...
I-I just wanted him gone,

693
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,723
like he... like he never...
like he never existed.

694
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:05,698
I guess your parents
were right about me, huh?

695
00:40:05,766 --> 00:40:08,834
I mean, I'm...
I'm my father all over again.

696
00:40:08,902 --> 00:40:12,538
I'm him.

697
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,739
I am him.

698
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,542
Holly: Dacus...

699
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:20,046
Listen to me. [ Sniffles ]

700
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:24,617
You are not him.
You're nothing like him.

701
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:25,785
You're beautiful, Dacus.

702
00:40:25,886 --> 00:40:28,788
[ Crying ] Oh, no. No.

703
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:31,891
Baby, listen.

704
00:40:31,992 --> 00:40:36,762
I only ever prayed two times
in my life.

705
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,564
Once...

706
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:45,638
to not feel so alone.
[ Sniffles ]

707
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,506
And once...

708
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:50,743
For Ross Lanten to be punished
for what he did.

709
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:55,448
Baby, you were the answer
to both my prayers.

710

Walt: Hey, punk, it's me.

717
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:01,580
Uh, I know
you don't want to talk to me.

718
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:03,783
Um, I know what it's like

719
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,651
not to want to talk to...
to anyone,

720
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:08,921
so, um...
Your mother always said

you and I were...
we're, uh... we're too alike.

You know?

Just don't make
the same mistake I made.

Um, don't, uh...
don't bury the pain.

Don't, uh...
don't lock it all up inside.

726

Um, it'll tear you up
in the long run, so...

Don't go down that road.
