1
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,800
Miss Theresa.

2
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,300
Your father is waiting for you.

3
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,000
I know.

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,300
Right now, my sweet.

5
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,800
I don't want to go.

6
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,500
Poor thing.

7
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,000
Your father wants you immediately!

8
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,100
Who is the father?

9
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,600
Who is the father?

10
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
Who is the father?

11
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
No!

12
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,000
Alfredo Garcia!

13
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,000
He was like a son to me.

14
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
I'll pay a million
to whoever brings me

15
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,200
the head of Afredo Garcia.

16
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,400
Bring me the head
of Alfredo Garcia.

17
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,800
Bring it to me!

18
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,400
-Do you care for a drink, sir?
-Uh, later.

19
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,700
Excuse me.

20
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,900
Welcome to Camino Real, sir.
-Thank you.

21
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,000
Enjoy your stay.

22
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mirado first, and then
la Munica, Goldendrina, and Toro.

23
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,900
Sing it, brothers.

24
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,200
Ladies and gentlemen...

25
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,700
...the bus us ready to leave in
two minutes. Please, let's go.

26
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
Good-bye my brothers from Ohio.

27
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,800
Good-bye my brothers from Norway.

28
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,000
Take your wooden hearts out
and find the soul in Mexico.

29
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,900
And bring back money.
Spend money all over, folks.

30
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,800
Have a good time,
but remember the Tlaquepaque.

31
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,600
Four tequila.

32
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,700
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

33
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
We are looking for an old
buddy of ours. A padre named Alfredo Garcia.

34
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,400
Does anyone here know him,
if you please.

35
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,300
Mrs.

36
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Miss?

37
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,000
You're sure, huh?

38
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,100
How about you?

39
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No, Senor.

40
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,300
First drink's on the house, gentlemen.

41
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,300
Whatta you like to hear?

42
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,900
Take care of those gentlemen, Paulo.

43
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,800
Your wishes, gentlemen?

44
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,900
-Tequila.
-Uh, Tequila and a beer back.

45
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,100
Good evenig.

46
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
Something, uh, for the ladies.

47
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,400
Come on, whatta you wanna hear?

48
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,200
Who knows?
What would you like?

49
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,600
How about,
uh, 'l Remember April'?

50
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,700
I remember April. Yeah.

51
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
-Excuse me.
What's that?

52
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
Oh, it's just an old song.

53
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Now, how about buying you a drink?

54
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,500
Crazy. Gimme a double
Jack Daniels on the rocks.

55
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,900
We've got a live one here.

56
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,400
Take me to your leader.

57
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,600
Well, cheers, money...

58
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,100
How do you like that beer?

59
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,000
You know they brought, uh,
German Burgermeisters over here

60
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,900
back in about eighteen
hundred and something.

61
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,500
Who knows? Long time ago.

62
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,500
Some of the best beet in the
world comes from Mexico.

63
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
How good you are.

64
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,800
How you guys like baseball?

65
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
Take her away.

66
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm beginning to like basketball lately,
it's a faster game,

67
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,300
you know what I mean?

68
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,600
How about that Bill Russel on the
Celtic, Nineteen sixty-nine?

69
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,000
Now, there was a ball player.

70
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,400
You've, uh, worked around
here quite awhile, huh?

71
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,300
Yeah, about six years.

72
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,600
Started up in the Black Cat in T.J.
Now there was a nice place.

73
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,400
Classy place, classy
people came in there.

74
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,600
One night Paulette Goddard came in...
and asked me if I knew...

75
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,700
You know a lot of
studs around here?

76
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,800
Who you looking for?

77
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,500
Well, like I said, an old buddy
of ours, a very close chum,

78
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,100
like to meet up with him again.

79
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He's quite a ladies' man.
His name is Alfredo Garcia.

80
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,800
Maybe you can help is find him.

81
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,700
He's about thirty. Sometimes
he calls himself Al...Garcia.

82
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,900
He speaks English,
Spanish and a little French.

83
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,800
Quite a stud, huh?

84
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,400
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
You got me.

85
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,200
I do recognize the name.

86
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,000
You know the name Garcia?

87
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,100
Sure, it's like Jones or Smith.

88
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,200
We're at the Hotel Camino Real,

89
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,900
if you come up with anything
we'd be glad to see you.

90
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,100
Bring that with you.

91
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, don't worry,
if he's alive, I'll find him.

92
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,400
Uh, alive isn't our problem.

93
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Well, uh, how about dead or alive?
How about that?

94
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Dead, just dead.

95
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,300
What would you like to hear?

96
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,000
I didn't catch your name, Mister?

97
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Dobbs. Fred C. Dobbs.

98
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,800
Paulo!

99
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,100
What's up?

100
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,300
When was the last time
Al Garcia was around?

101
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,200
One week. At the most a week.

102
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,200
You know anybody around here that...
might know where he is?

103
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Elita.

104
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,000
He has stayed with her.

105
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,000
Elita.

106
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,000
No shit?

107
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I'll be dammed.

108
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,600
Ola, Benny.

109
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,400
Smiley. Long wat from Durango,
aren't you, Pard?

110
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:25,000
Ah, lemme see.
Things have changed.

111
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,300
Hey... put my shoe back.

112
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,000
Get up.

113
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,600
Excuse me.

114
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,100
What are you doing here so early?

115
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,000
It's later than you think, Chula.
How'd you like a black eye?

116
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,700
What have you been drinking?

117
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,500
You're a lying, cheating,
no-good two-bit bitch.

118
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,600
The one you had last week when
I couldn't see you for three days.

119
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,000
Ha, what'd the matter?
Ha, waht's the matter... Benny?

120
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,900
Ah, good evening.

121
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,900
Yeah, well, give me a double
bourbon with a champagne back

122
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,100
and none of your Texano bullshit...
now shove off.

123
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,000
Three days... and three nights.

124
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,100
Alfredo Garcia.

125
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,600
Si, Alfredo.

126
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,900
I feel very bad, uh...

127
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Give me a chance I'll
explain it to you, olkay?

128
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,300
Do... it.

129
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Well, he was here and
we spent some time together.

130
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,800
We were saying goodbye...
forever.

131
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,600
It took a little time.

132
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,700
If I ever get my hands on him
I'm gonna kill him.

133
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm afraid it's too late.

134
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,800
When he left here he was very
drunk, and, uh, near Salti1 19...

135
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,200
his car refused the road
and the rocks killed him.

136
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,700
Jesus Christ.
-Amen.

137
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,500
I gotta go, Elita.

138
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,600
-Do you have to go?
-See you later.

139
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,100
Pardon.

140
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300
Come in.

141
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,000
Glasses.

142
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,000
Give him your number.

143
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Eleven. Lucky.

144
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,200
Bet you guys didn't expect
to see me so soon, huh?

145
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,800
You're wasting our time.
What have you got?

146
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
You don't mess around, do you?
Right down to business.

147
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,800
It's really very simple.

148
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,800
If you give us the information we want,
as to where we can find Alfredo Garcia,

149
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,700
we'll give you a thousand dollars.

150
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,200
If your information is wrong... you,
too are wrong... dead wrong.

151
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,500
Well, you see,
he's uh, friend of a friend.

152
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,700
And I'd like to know
what you want him for.

153
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,600
Well. that's not true. Uh, I mean,
I gotta tell somebody something right?

154
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,100
You're interested in money, aren't you?
Money you can spend.

155
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Yes, sir. lndirectly.

156
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,000
I mean, there are other things.
Like I'd like to stay alive.

157
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,900
A loser.

158
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,000
Nobody loses all the time.

159
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't like the money.
How much is it worth to you?

160
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,600
We can go five thousand.
-Ten thousand.

161
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,400
-I go all the way or I pass.
-l... gather by that you mean dead?

162
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
That's right.
That's what I got in mind.

163
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,900
Well. my friend, one must
do what one must do.

164
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,200
All we require from you...
is physical proof that Garcia is dead.

165
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,100
What kind of physical proof?

166
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,400
We're well aware of the problem and
we're prepared to settle for his head.

167
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Yeah, but the, uh...
head must match the picture.

168
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
It's a deal.

169
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,200
But I want five thousand dollars in advance.
I'll need some operating cash, right?

170
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,300
You don't have to kill
him with kindness.

171
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,100
Give him two hundred dollars.

172
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,100
Well, thank you, gentlemen.

173
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,800
You've got four days.

174
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,400
And Benny... after that
we come to find you.

175
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Ow! Goddammit!

176
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,200
Change the sheets, darling.
I got another job. You hear me?

177
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,700
Get up!

178
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,000
Come on, honey.
It's your room.

179
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,700
-Don't!
-Up and at 'em, Goddammit!

180
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,800
-Oh, don't.
-Hey, Elita!

181
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,700
Don't. Cut it out.

182
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,600
Hey, I saw those guys that were
looking for Alfredo... yesterday.

183
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,800
Did you tell them he was dead?

184
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,900
No.

185
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,100
Why not?

186
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,600
In this house we know nothing.

187
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,900
I wanna see his grave.

188
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,700
Tell me...

189
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,800
did he give you a good head?

190
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,900
You... dirty man.

191
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,500
You dirty, lousy, son-of-a-gun.

192
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,000
Oh, don't hurt me.

193
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,000
Now... pack a lunch.

194
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,900
No, you pack. You pack, you hear,
'cause we're going on a picnic.

195
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Oh, no.

196
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,200
I'm gonna find a golden fleece, baby.

197
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,600
What is all this, Benny?

198
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,900
Just get up.
-Oh, okay.

199
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,400
Get up! Get up, come on.

200
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,100
All right... I am up!

201
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,200
-Up, up!
-Can't you see?

202
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,400
Get up.

203
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh, no. Oh, don't play with
my hangover, please, Benny.

204
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,200
Come on.

205
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
Do you want one?

206
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,800
Oh, yes, the paper is in the, in the...

207
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,800
Goodbye.

208
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,800
Goodbye. Hope everything
goes well. Have a nice trip.

209
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,200
Let me pass.
I have a heavy load.

210
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,100
Stop here for your ice cream.

211
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,500
Give me a little kiss, coyote.

212
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,600
Jesus... Christ.

213
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,900
It doesn't matter, baby...

214
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,000
as long as I'm with you
I don't give a damn.

215
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,000
Enough already, Chalo.

216
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,600
Have pity, Chalo?

217
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
-Enough.
-It's not bothering.

218
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,300
Hungry, baby?

219
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,500
A little. But not for corn.

220
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,400
Meat in the pot, honey.

221
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,200
Bravo... bravo.

222
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,600
-Hell, I wasn't trying to hit 'em, you know.
-I know... you weren't.

223
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,800
I used to shoot a lot of pistols
when I was in the army.

224
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,800
You're a nice gringo.

225
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,500
You didn't have a thing
to do in the army, anyway.

226
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Oh, you'd be surprised, honey.

227
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,700
-Don't bug me about it.
-You are a stupid son-of-a-bitch.

228
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Let's go.

229
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,800
Then we'll go to Cozumel,
after that the lsle of Mujeres.

230
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,900
-You ever been there?
-No.

231
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,400
I haven't either.

232
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,900
Hell, I've never been anyplace I went to
go back to that's for dammed sure.

233
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,600
I was once at a place
I'd like to see again.

234
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,200
Yeah? Absolutely, baby, you name it.

235
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,700
It's called Guanajato.
With a G. Guanajato.

236
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,800
Guanajato.

237
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,400
Yes. It's very good.

238
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's a beautiful...
old Spanish town.

239
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,700
It's, uh, sixteenth century. Lemme see,
sixteen, uh, seventeen century.

240
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,600
I dunno. I get mixed
up with the centuries.

241
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,200
Yes, because...
This town, oh, well, never... mind.

242
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,800
You know, and they have
tunnels built all over the town.

243
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,000
And on top of the tunnels
there's the, the houses built.

244
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,300
You can see the little windows,
you know, hanging out.

245
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,500
-Yeah.
-Beautiful, you'll like it there.

246
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,600
I was there once with a...

247
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,900
Yeah, with who?

248
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,500
I forget.

249
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Can we go there? Sometime?

250
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,500
No, we'll go someplace new.

251
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,900
Can we find a new place?

252
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,800
With Alfredo's help we
can do anything, honey.

253
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,400
Uh, we're not doing bad.

254
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,900
I'll go on doing commercials and,
pretty soon you can buy your place.

255
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,700
Bullshit, baby, that's not my place.
Just a pit stop for a bunch of tourists.

256
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,600
-This time I'm moving up.
-My son.

257
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,600
We're moving up.

258
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,600
And most important, at last to me is,
we're together, Benny.

259
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,400
We're together.

260
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,300
And we marry some day.
In a church.

261
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,200
Yeah, We'll marry
some day in a church.

262
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,700
Bullshit, Benny!

263
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,000
-Naw, I mean it this time.
When?

264
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,700
When?

265
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
Sunday.

266
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,500
Why so?

267
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,000
Why?

268
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,100
Because I figure Al's worth
about ten thousand bucks.

269
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,500
I don't understand.

270
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,500
Your primera amor, my darling,
has, uh, made a mistake.

271
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
And some people... want him dead.

272
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,700
l... You're kidding?

273
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,300
No, I'm not kidding.

274
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,400
And we're gonna get some proof.

275
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,600
Jesus, y...

276
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,000
Well, l... Not with me, huh? You don't want
me to be part of that, do you?

277
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,200
You are a part of it.

278
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,200
For you or for me

279
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,000
or do it for Al.

280
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,500
He wants you to be happy, but...

281
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,400
Didn't he always watching you happy.

282
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,300
Yes, I would be happy...

283
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,000
Well, it's good knowing
what you want, Benny.

284
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
But it so happens
I don't know what I want.

285
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,500
You see, uh... we, we,
women have so many ways.

286
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
l, I'm just shocked.

287
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,000
Salud Alfredo.

288
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,000
Salud Alfredo, right?

289
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,600
I guess he'd want
me to be happy.

290
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
Yeah.

291
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah...

292
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,900
Benny?

293
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yeah?

294
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,400
Have you really thought
about marrying me?

295
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,300
I mean seriously?

296
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,200
Have you?

297
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,800
Yes, I have.

298
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,900
How come you never asked me?

299
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,200
I don't know,
but I do now.

300
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,300
Ask me again.

301
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Ask me.

302
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,800
Will you marry me?

303
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Coyote! Coyote...

304
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,100
Let's not sleep in the city tonight.

305
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,900
I brought some blankets and food.
Everything we need.

306
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,800
I'll fix a dinner for you and
we can sleep under the stars.

307
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,800
I wanna make you
so happy tonight.

308
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,900
We butting in?
-Yeah, a little bit.

309
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,400
Well, we'll leave if you want us to.

310
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,800
That fire looks mighty good, though.

311
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,000
Hey, I think I got a cold from
that chick... last week.

312
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,300
She was hacking like
a Goddamn coal miner.

313
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,500
Play anything?

314
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,800
Not much. My wife does.

315
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:15,200
No kidding? Hey... you know an old
song called Cielto Lindo...

316
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Yes.

317
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,200
How about that? Hey...
could she play it?

318
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,900
If you please.

319
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,700
Say, that guitar is like a woman.
Just like a woman.

320
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,600
She'll be good
if you can get her.

321
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,200
She'll tremble when you touch her.

322
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,000
Okay, man, knock it off.

323
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,400
But she just keeps on getting better.

324
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Looky what I got.
you wanna borrowie it?

325
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Yeah.

326
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,600
Well, I think I'll just borrow... yours.

327
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,800
It's all right, Benny.
It's all right.

328
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You two guys are...
definitely on my shit list.

329
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,000
He's a rotten sport, your old man.

330
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,000
Let's get out of here. Come on.

331
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,500
I'm gonna kill you one day,
you gringo son-of-a-bitch!

332
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,400
Oh, no, you won't, Benny.

333
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,600
I've been here before,
you don't know the way.

334
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,400
What the hell, she can handle it
a lot better than I can.

335
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,200
She sure can.

336
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,700
Please don't.

337
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,700
Please.

338
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,000
Gimme that bottle, Goddammit!

339
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,200
Son-of-a-bitch!

340
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,600
Hey! You're dirt!

341
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,800
Come on. Let's get out of here.

342
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,200
Come on.

343
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,200
I don't know what to say.

344
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,300
Dammit the hell,
I don't know what to say.

345
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,500
You did all right.
I will tell everything to the police.

346
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,900
No chance.

347
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:15,900
You're gonna take me to find Alfredo.
And that's our ticket outta here.

348
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:23,300
Jesus, I don't know how you
can get money from a dead body,

349
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,900
I mean, I don't believe those
people and what they say.

350
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,700
I take 'em proof.
His head.

351
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,600
-His... head?
-For proof!

352
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,800
But it's a crime, Benny...
you're mad!

353
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,000
He's dead! Shut up!

354
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,700
Well, you want me to desecrate a grave?

355
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,900
Don't give me that crap!

356
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,400
There's nothing sacred
about a hole in the ground...

357
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,800
or a man that's in it... or you, or me.

358
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,500
Listen, the church
cuts off the feet, fingers,

359
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,400
any other Goddamn thing
from the saints, don't they?

360
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,200
Well, what the hell, Alfredo's our saint.
He's a saint of our money.

361
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,800
And I'm gonna borrow a piece of him.

362
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,000
All right...

363
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,400
I'll take you to him and then
I'm gonna go, you know.

364
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:29,200
Cause I figure everything
is gonna be over with us.

365
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,100
I don't want any more of that.

366
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:37,200
Oh, please, please.
Let's put it together,

367
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:45,000
just... make it round and let's go back
and forget about the whole thing.

368
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,100
We'll never talk about it again.

369
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:52,000
Jesus, just being together is,
is enough!

370
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,400
No, it's not, baby!

371
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:00,400
It takes pan, bread... money.

372
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,400
We need a room for the night
with a double bed.

373
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,900
I'm sorry, sir, but this
hotel does not allow...

374
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,400
Now, listen...

375
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,800
Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin...
from Mexico City.

376
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,900
And we're very, very tired.

377
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,200
And you pluck out one of those keys
while I sign the register.

378
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:56,900
Understand?
Understand?

379
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,400
Best room in the house, please.

380
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,200
I love you.

381
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,800
Where are we?

382
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,400
We can ask for him at a place
they make furniture.

383
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,500
That's it. There.

384
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
-Good Afternoon.
-Hello.

385
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,000
I'm looking for some information.
You're the village carpenter?

386
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,300
Yes.
I make rustic furniture, but it's good quality.

387
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,300
It's very nice, I'll come back
What you do is beautiful.

388
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,000
You're very kind.

389
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
No, good craftsmen are becoming rare.

390
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,600
Thank you
You're very kind.

391
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,200
What's he say?

392
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,600
No luck.

393
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,000
Yeah?

394
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,000
No luck at all.
I guess we came all the way for nothing.

395
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,800
Lemme tell you something, baby,

396
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I could've died in Mexico City or T.J....

397
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,800
and never known
what the hell it was all about.

398
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:52,200
I got a chance... a ticket,
we're not gonna miss it!

399
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Now get in there! Sit down!

400
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,000
And take me to him!

401
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,800
There ain't no more chances.

402
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:07,600
Get in!

403
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,800
And leads me to him.

404
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,400
There is no such a chance twice.

405
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,600
I am Madame Elita Burrasso Vega.

406
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,200

I knew Alfredo well.

407
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,200
Yes, he fell silent.
What a pity.

408
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,100
What are you doing here by
yourself and the gringo?

409
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,200
What's she say?

410
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,700
I think she'd like us to go.

411
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,700
Well, you tell her
that we've come a long way

412
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,200
to pay our respects to this man.
We're very tired.

413
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,500
Tell her we wanna
get a room for the night.

414
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,900
We'll leave in the morning.

415
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,700
I can tell you the brandy.

416
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,900
Thank you.

417
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,500
Listen, honey... you oughta
be drunk in Fresno, California.

418
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,000
This place is a palace.

419
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:32,900
Listen, I promise I'll put the grave
back just the way I found it.

420
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,600
Nobody's gonna miss him anyhow.

421
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,800
Alfredo's been trying
to beat this rap all his life.

422
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,200
So have l, so have you.

423
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,600
He loved you,
but I love you now!

424
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,100
Think he'd give a damn
if his head could buy you

425
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,000
what you've always been looking for?

426
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,700
Way out.

427
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,100
There's a church here.

428
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,200
Could we go there?

429
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,100
Yeah.

430
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,300
Later.

431
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,500
I got to go.

432
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,700
I'm going with you.

433
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,400
No.

434
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:44,200
Hey, ah, God.

435
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:50,000
Hey, hey, we're alive.

436
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,200
Hey, come on. Hey!

437
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,700
Hey.

438
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:45,700
Ah. It's gone. hey, honey,
come on, we gotta...

439
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,800
we gotta get outta here.

440
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,500
The head's gone we better...
we gotta get outta here!

441
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,800
Come on you, you gotta help me.
Sit up.

442
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:09,000
We gotta get this...
this... this place.

443
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,100
I came to get...

444
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,200
Maybe you wanna...
you wanna stay here?

445
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,800
You wanna stay here?
Hell, then stay here!

446
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,900
I ain't with him! Goddammit!

447
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,000
Stay with him! Go on
and stay with him, shit!

448
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:51,400
Turn over, Goddammit!
Turn over and be in there right!

449
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:57,600
I was only kidding. Oh, shit!

450
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,800
You son-of-a-bitches!

451
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,600
Dig a me?

452
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:22,700
Have any americans been here
asking about Alfredo Garcia? Huh?

453
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,600
Ah, yes, two men arrived.

454
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:28,600
What?

455
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:34,300
In a green station wagon,
didn't ask anything.

456
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,000
Yeah. Get outta here!

457
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,200
Get out, Goddammit!

458
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,000
Get outta here... you son-of-a-bitch
or I'll kill you right there!

459
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,400
Will you get, Goddammit?

460
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,800
Move when I say move!
You motherfucker!

461
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,200
Look at me with your
damn fucking eyes.

462
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,200
Come down and tackle me, you bastards!

463
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,100
I'm gonna nail you,
somewhere I'm gonna nail you.

464
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:38,900
You're up there, you son-of-a...
I'm gonna find you.

465
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,800
Damn your eyes!

466
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,400
Lemme see that big station wagon.

467
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:00,000
You and all the Goddamn drinking
I'm doing all the fucking work!

468
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,600
Why?

469
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,100
Because it feels
so Goddamn good.

470
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,500
Get outta there, come on.

471
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,900
Sorry, Al.

472
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,600
Sorry!

473
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,600
What's so special
about you anyway, huh?

474
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,400
Get over there.

475
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:23,200
You got something...
valuable inside, huh?

476
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:30,400
Aw, come on, Al, cop it out, baby,
you got jewels in your ears?

477
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,300
Diamonds up your nose?

478
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,600
You son-of-a-bitch!

479
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,900
It wasn't worth it, baby.

480
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:47,500
It wasn't worth 'er.

481
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,100
and I'll be dammed if she's not
keeping the best part o' you company.

482
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,900
You low life bastard!

483
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:14,500
There's nothing here.

484
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,700
Let's go!

485
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,600
Three days and three nights, huh?

486
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,100
I hope you enjoyed her... I did.

487
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,700
Hell, it wasn't your fault,
I know that.

488
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,700
But we're gonna find out.

489
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,500
You and me.

490
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,700
Good day, sir.
I'm at your service.

491
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:18,300
Scrambled eggs, very cold beer,
if you please.

492
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:26,000
Wash your car, sir?
It's very dirty

493
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:29,800
Uh, go ahead.

494
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,800
Where is my beer. ma'am?
Hurry. please.

495
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,200
I'm coming, sir.

496
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,800
Sir, there are a lot of flies in your car.

497
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,600
Huh?

498
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,300
Many flies.

499
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:23,000
Flies? Oh, flies.

500
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,600
-You got any ice?
-lce?

501
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,200
Yes, yes, I have ice, sir.
Go... for the ice!

502
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,400
No!

503
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:40,300
No! Me.

504
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,000
Where is it, ma'am.
-Over here.

505
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,800
What do you have in the sack, sir?

506
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:05,100
A cat. Dead cat. Used to
belong to a friend of mine.

507
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,900
Boy, are you a nice gringo, baby.

508
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,000
What about a ballad
for my beautiful man?

509
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,400
Bullshit!

510
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,900
Have a drink, pal!

511
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,800
Well, I know about graves.

512
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,800
What's done is done. Right?
Ended.

513
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:54,200
I've killed people.
And worse, whole lot worse.

514
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:01,000
But I'm gonna keep him.
I'm not giving him back.

515
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,600
I didn't do it!
But I would have.

516
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,600
Ah, that's just the way it goes.

517
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,300
Ask him... if he did it for money.

518
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,800
You do this for money?
You do this for money, huh?

519
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,400
No.

520
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:22,600
Yes.

521
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,300
Take it.

522
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,200
That's all I got. Please.

523
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,200
Goddamn you!

524
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,300
I'm gonna finish this with him!

525
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,200
Alfredo, senor, give it... to me.

526
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,500
I give you nothing.

527
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,400
-Good day.
-Good day.

528
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:20,400
Pardon me, uh, do you speak English?

529
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,400
Yea, a couple of us do.

530
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,600
Ah, good. Uh...
I see there're trouble here, huh?

531
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:34,600
We got some trouble, too.
Looks like we're kinda lost.

532
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,400
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

533
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:47,200
Well, look, uh, you see we left here
and we're trying to get to there.

534
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,200
Now, where's the cut-off?

535
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:54,300
It's right here.
But you're gonna have to take it.

536
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:00,000
Oh, oh, we're gonna have to take it.
I see. I see.

537
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:02,100
Thank you very much.

538
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,200
Thank you very much.

539
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,900
Well, I found it.
It's right here.

540
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:09,700
We're gonna...
have to make our move now.

541
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:52,300
-You okay, Benny?
-Yeah.

542
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,500
Who the hell are they?

543
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,700
Jyst the family.

544
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,600
That's him.

545
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,300
Sure had a nose for shit!

546
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:20,300
Yeah, I could smell it a hundred miles.
Sometimes closer.

547
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,400
Johnny? Johnny?

548
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,700
Do I get paid?

549
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,700
Yeah, you get paid.

550
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,200
Hey, Johnny.

551
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:12,800
Remember how l, I used
to take a shower in there.

552
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,700
You know that?
You don't know that.

553
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:29,300
How you like that, huh?
Hope it cools you off, you bastard!

554
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:21,800
Well, he's taking
a shower now, you know?

555
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,900
Son-of-a-bitch.

556
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,300
Hello, uh...

557
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:58,700
Benny.

558
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:03,200
Hello Benny.
I thought you would be back soon. Uh...

559
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:10,200
-I guess that's it, uh?
-Yeah.

560
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:19,400
It's all here. You can, uh,
you can count it, if you want to.

561
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:21,000
It's all there.

562
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,800
Helluva job, Benny.

563
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:26,500
-Come, I'll show you.
Just, uh, put it on the table.

564
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:36,500
Here, Benny, here it is.

565
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:58,100
Don't you wanna check it?

566
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:02,100
Oh, we'll check it.
But you're too smart to stiff us.

567
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,300
How much is it worth?

568
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:09,700
How much is it really worth?

569
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,600
Ten grand is all you get... bartender.

570
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:19,000
Who do you want it for?
Not you guys, you don't want it.

571
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:22,900
What the hell would you want with...

572
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:26,600
No question, Benny...
The ten thousand answers it all.

573
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:30,400
Put it on the table and we'll
check it and goodbye.

574
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:35,600
Go and have yourself a party or two.
You deserve it.

575
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:38,000
No.

576
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:44,500
Come on, Bartender, you deaf?

577
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:48,600
You're either that or you're a bigger
shmuck than you look like.

578
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:54,800
l'd, uh, like to keep the basket, okay?

579
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,100
Keep it.

580
01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,800
Thanks.

581
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:05,400
You see, this belonged
to a very... special lady.

582
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:12,900
Once upon a time...
she filled it up with food...

583
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:15,800
and we'd go on a picnic.

584
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
We turned off a dirt road,

585
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:24,100
we ate the food she prepared
with her hands.

586
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,500
Very special hands.

587
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:37,500
And that's why I'd like to know,
why you don't... take it!

588
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:40,600
Tell me... what the head
of Alfredo Garcia's is worth!

589
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:43,000
And to who! Understand?

590
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,900
This is the man who pays...

591
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,400
All right, Al. Let's go!

592
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,600
There's a guardhouse coming up.
Somebody's waiting for us.

593
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,300
Take it easy, Al.

594
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,000
I'm here to see El Jefe.

595
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:09,400
What for?

596
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,900
Just tell him, uh,
Alfredo Garcia is here.

597
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,900
I've got something here you want.
His name is Alfredo.

598
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:41,100
I don't know what you want
him for, but here he is.

599
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,000
Senor... bring me the money.

600
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:03,600
Welcome. I was expecting you.

601
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:32,600
Won't you join me for a drink?
I'm a very happy man.

602
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,300
I got nothing to celebrate.

603
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:54,000
Here's the...
merchandise you bought.

604
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,000
And paid for.

605
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:09,500
Take... it and go.
I have everything that I want.

606
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:12,400
I have my grandson.

607
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:16,400
So go.

608
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,800
Don't forget to take that
and throw it to the pigs.

609
01:42:30,900 --> 01:42:31,800
No.

610
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:39,000
Sixteen people are dead because of...

611
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:43,800
Him... and you.

612
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,700
And me.

613
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:49,500
And one of 'em was
a damn good friend of mine!

614
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:51,000
No!

615
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,800
No.

616
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:15,200
First time I saw him he was dead.

617
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,200
Kill him!

618
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:59,600
Come on, Al,
we're going home.

619
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:29,600
Listen. Take this.

620
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,800
You take care of the boy...
and I'll take care of the father.
