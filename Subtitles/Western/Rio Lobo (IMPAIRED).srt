00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:31,002
Ho, ho, what did they give you
when you signed off?

477
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,838
Two dollars.

478
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,258
- Where are you heading?
PIERRE: Oh, just look around.

479
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,218
I'm going back to Texas.

480
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,428
Man who brought me up
has a ranch in Rio Lobo.

481
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,098
Well, $2 won't get you very far.

482
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,641
Since you two have been locked up,

483
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,936
our payrolls have been
coming through pretty regularly.

484
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,605
That'll get you to Texas.
You can owe me.

485
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,400
Colonel, I never thought
I'd wanna kiss a Yank.

486
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,487
Colonel, if we run
into one of those fellows you're after,

487
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:58,864
where can we reach you?

488
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,323
Blackthorne, Texas.

489
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,951
That's near your Rio Lobo country.

490
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,413
The sheriff there
can always get in touch with me.

491
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:29,978
I see the sheriff of Blackthorne County
has earned himself some bounty money.

492
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:34,149
Heh, one of these little hides
can buy a man a lot of drinks.

493
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,359
- Good to see you, Cord.
- Thanks.

494
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,944
I was wondering when you'd show up.

495
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:42,032
Well, I got your message, Pat,
that Pierre Cordona wanted to see me.

496
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,491
Yeah, you got here just in time.

497
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,869
He got in last night.
He's up at the hotel.

498
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,330
Come on in. I'll give you a drink.

499
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,999
What's it all about, Cord?

500
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,128
- Will you tell me why you're here?
- Well...

501
00:36:55,338 --> 00:37:00,258
Didn't, uh... Didn't Cordona grab
a couple of Army payrolls from the Yanks?

502
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,509
That's right.

503
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:05,388
And I heard that, uh, you captured him
and put him in a prison camp.

504
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,891
You heard right.

505
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,685
Cord.

506
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,064
You're not fixing on causing
any trouble, are you?

507
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,650
- I wouldn't like that.
- Don't worry, Pat.

508
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,527
And besides, you're too good
for that young fellow.

509
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,238
There's no hard feelings between us.

510
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,115
- The war is over.
- Oh, that's good.

511
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,243
Then why do you want to see him?

512
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,913
The only reason Cordona could get away
with those payrolls

513
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:34,918
was because some people on our side
were selling him information.

514
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,503
I'm after them.

515
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,298
Are you working for the Army,
or is this something personal?

516
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,342
Both.

517
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:46,429
Sheriff, I'd say
you were gonna have company.

518
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,683
- Which one of you is the sheriff?
- I am, miss, I'm Pat Cronin.

519
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,893
- If there's anything--
- I want to report a murder.

520
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,145
PAT: A murder?
- And I want the man who did it arrested.

521
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,814
- Where'd this happen?
- In Rio Lobo.

522
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,191
PAT: Oh, I'm sorry.
- What do you mean, you're sorry?

523
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,567
PAT:
That's out of my jurisdiction.

524
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,486
Does that mean you're not
gonna do anything?

525
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,072
- Well, it means that--
- Excuse me, miss, you said Rio Lobo.

526
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,449
- Did you--? Huh?
- You connected with the sheriff's office?

527
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,326
Are you connected
with the sheriff's office?

528
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,912
- Well, no, l--
- Will you please stay out of this?

529
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,914
Sheriff, I asked you a question.

530
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,833
Does that mean
you're not gonna do anything?

531
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,210
It means I can't do anything.
I have no authority there.

532
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,670
Look, a man was shot and killed.

533
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:22,632
Miss, unless a U.S. Marshal
or the sheriff of Rio Lobo asks me--

534
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,176
- You know the sheriff, don't you?
- Yes, ma'am, I do.

535
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,595
- And you know he's not gonna ask you.
- I know that too.

536
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:31,141
Especially since the man who committed
the murder was one of his deputies.

537
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,019
I'm sorry, miss.

538
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,271
Well, so am l.

539
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,398
I just thought--

540
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,193
So am l.

541
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:50,201
Who is the sheriff of Rio Lobo?

542
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,995
Tom Hendricks.

543
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:53,913
- Blue Tom?
- That's right.

544
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,707
Ever run into him?

545
00:38:55,916 --> 00:39:00,211
Well, I chased him enough,
but I never got lucky.

546
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,839
Well, how about that drink?

547
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,716
- I'm out.
- As usual.

548
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,634
I'll buy you one.

549
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,809
Town's growing up, Pat.

550
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,900
- Good morning, Hank.
- Morning, sheriff, can I help you?

551
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,319
I'd like you to meet a good friend
of mine, Cord McNally.

552
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,737
- Glad to meet you.
- Thank you.

553
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,448
I'm looking for a Pierre Cordona.
He's staying here.

554
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,992
- Room 19.
HANK: He's gone.

555
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,452
He's up there, all right.

556
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:33,995
Just a minute.

557
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,247
He left a message about something.

558
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,832
Um, let's see, now--

559
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:41,503
He said he'd shoot anybody who woke
him up unless the building was on fire.

560
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,421
He gave me $2.

561
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,299
Oh, it was to see
that nobody started a fire.

562
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:50,011
Oh, $2 will buy a lot of sleep
around here.

563
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,348
- I guess we can wait for a while.
- How about that drink?

564
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,850
And remember, you're buying.

565
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,186
- Hello, Jane.
- Hi, sheriff.

566
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,523
Sit down. Give us a bottle, Jim.

567
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,530
Little Miss Busybody.

568
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,835
She'll either be in the jail or the hotel.

569
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,796
Chuck, take a look in the jail.

570
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,017
Nobody in the jail, Whitey.

571
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,727
All right.

572
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,314
George, you go around back.

573
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,942
- Come in that way.
- Right.

574
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,155
You two come with me.

575
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,999
Pat.

576
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:13,595
Well, young lady,
you gave us quite a chase.

577
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,681
Sheriff, this is the man
that I wanted you to arrest.

578
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,224
He's the murderer.

579
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,269
Well, that may give the sheriff
the wrong idea about me.

580
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,189
It was self-defense, sheriff.
Old man tried to knife--

581
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,233
- That's a lie, he didn't have--
- Hold on, miss, I can handle this.

582
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,028
Who are you, mister?
And what exactly is your business here?

583
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,864
Name's Carter, Whitey Carter.

584
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,574
I'm a deputy from Rio Lobo.

585
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,784
As to my business,
I came looking for her.

586
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,161
- She's wanted.
- Wanted?

587
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,412
What for?

588
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:43,708
She and the old man she lived with
ran one of them medicine shows.

589
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,587
You know, snake oil,
crooked shell games.

590
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,005
Pick a few pockets on the side.

591
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:52,050
- That's another lie, I didn't do anything.
WHITEY: She was the come-on.

592
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,261
Sheriff in Rio Lobo
just wants to talk to her.

593
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,348
- So I'll take her along with me.
- Just a minute, Mr. Carter.

594
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:01,726
I'm the sheriff of Blackthorne,
and I wanna see a warrant.

595
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,270
- A warrant?
- For the young lady's arrest.

596
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,023
Well, heh, I never thought about that.

597
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,567
PAT: Without a warrant,
you're not taking anybody.

598
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,070
I got a warrant right here, sheriff.

599
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,032
Satisfied, sheriff?

600
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,993
Now drop your gun and go sit down.

601
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,207
All right, everyone stand still,
no one gets hurt.

602
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,042
Come on, you.

603
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,505
[GRUNTS]

604
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,677
Look out, Cord.

605
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,816
- Did they hit you, Pat?
- No, I did it myself when I hit the floor.

606
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,193
You're getting too old
for these dive-downs.

607
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,861
- Well, captain.
- Hello, colonel.

608
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,905
Glad you joined us when you did.

609
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,032
I heard the racket
and somehow I knew it was you.

610
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,534
How did it start?

611
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,954
Well, this young lady here
shot that white-haired man.

612
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,956
She really didn't wanna go
with him, did she?

613
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,667
- Can you blame her?
- Well, I'll be damned. Look here, colonel.

614
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,627
This was one of the fellows
you were hunting.

615
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,878
Well, I never--

616
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,256
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

617
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,882
Is he dead?

618
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,135
McNALLY:
Unfortunately, yes.

619
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,511
Did I kill him?

620
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,055
Not entirely, but you sure helped.

621
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,766
Well, I couldn't let him take me.

622
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,518
I'd rather be dead.

623
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,437
But you damn near got us all killed.

624
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,480
Well, I'm sorry, I--

625
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,649
- I just--
- Are you gonna faint?

626
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,860
I... Unh.

627
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,865
- What'll I do with her?
- Bring her up to my room.

628
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,661
McNALLY: Where is it?

Yes, Ruf, we got a lot of work for you.

What did you find out?

I talked to the stage driver
that brought the girl from Rio Lobo.

648

Said he picked her up
a couple of miles out of town.

She was telling the truth, all right.

650
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:44,847
He was after her, and he shot the old man
with the medicine wagon.

Now, what did Tuscarora say
in that letter?

652
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,813
Only that he saw
one of the men you were after.

653
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,358
- A man with white hair.
- Well, that'd be Whitey from downstairs.

654
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,277
He said that, uh, Whitey worked
for a rich Yankee.

655
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,030
Tuscarora said
he has never seen this Yank yet.

Well, you didn't come all the way
to Blackthorne to tell me that.

No. Tuscarora's in trouble.

658

They're trying
to take his old man's land.
