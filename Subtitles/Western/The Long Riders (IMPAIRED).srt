Yee-ha!

00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,579
(gunfire continues)

3
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:05,017
- Can't he go any faster, Jesse?
- He's goin' fast enough, Ed.

4
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,351
(gunshots)

5
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,857
- You watch them people, Frank.
- Shut up, Ed!

6
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,035
- What about that safe?
- There ain't no safe, Ed.

7
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,537
All the money's in the strongbox
and in the cash drawers.

8
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,374
I don't believe you.
You got a safe in here some place.

9
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,003
Tell me where it is or I'm gonna
put a bullet in your brainpan.

10
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,047
Get outta there, Ed.

11
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,966
Have you gone crazy, Ed?

12
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,554
- (screams)
- Watch it, Jesse!

13
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,976
Jesse!

14
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,101
How long will it take
that posse to get here?

15
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,477
There won't be one.

16
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,938
They'll go about ten miles
and get tired,

17
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,982
and go back and call the Pinkertons.

18
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,860
How come we're standin' guard?

19
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,363
'Cause every once in a while I'm wrong.

20
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,537
We'll take you upriver
to the Mimms' house.

21
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,164
Get the bullet out there.

22
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,876
You stay quiet now.

23
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,550
Come here, Ed.

24
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,774
Jesse! Jesse!

25
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,946
- Shit! What'd you do that for?
- Panickin' and shootin' innocent folks.

26
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,866
That's for goddamn
gettin' me near killed!

27
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,248
Shit, I didn't mean no harm.

28
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,419
You're through, Ed.
You ain't gonna ride with me no more.

29
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,217
Are you gonna take that off him?

30
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,429
I seen what you done.

31
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,974
You may be family,
but I ain't sidin' with ya.

32
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,060
You're on your own.

33
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,860
Cole, give him his cut.

34
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,508
You threw yourself away a good livin'.

35
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,053
Now listen good.

36
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:31,264

or the Youngers with that bank,...

I hear it.

Yeah, I'd better go talk to this fella.

48
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,398

You wanna keep 'em?

56
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,223
It was just a request.

57
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,811
Well, I got a request of my own.

58
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,857
"I'm a Good Ol' Rebel".

..scare some more
innocent folk half to death.

70
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,862
- Never liked people standin' behind me.
- Most people would be flattered.

71
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,116
Ain't often
Belle Shirley stands behind a man.

72
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,078
I reckon that's the truth.

73
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,635
Are you still askin' $15?

74
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,179
I sure am.

75
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,603
Well, ain't nothin' worth that price.

76
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,106
Well, I don't figure I missed much.

77
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,987
But I'll tell you what I will do.

78
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,783
I'll go twelve and a half for you,
since you're about to go broke.

79
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,285
Huh.

80
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,373
I only got eleven. I'll cut you for it.

81
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,876
Make your move.

82
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,605
I'll be go to hell.

83
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,654
When your luck changes,
you feel free to call on me.

84
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,243
Everybody ante up.

85
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,294
Women... I love 'em.

86
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,049
We was all in the war.

87
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:20,929
Robbin' the first Yankee bank
because we didn't know no better.

88
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,224
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

89
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,435
After that we was...
just in the habit.

90
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,690
So I guess we'll just...
keep on goin'...

91
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,944
..till they lock us up or hang us.

92
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,342
You've hardly given yourself
time enough to heal.

93
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,469
I gotta get back to things.

94
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,764
Ma needs money
to help keep the farm goin'.

95
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:10,061
I reckon your ma can keep the farm
goin' and a few more things to boot.

96
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,231
Well, the others
ain't no good without me.

97
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,025
They gotta have somebody
to make the plans.

98
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,864
But, uh... don't worry, Zee.

99
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm comin' back for ya.

100
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,912
I thought you'd be over
with that Tebbs girl.

101
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,749
Maybe I oughta be. She's awful pretty.

102
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,920
If you think so. Course, every
fella round here's been to visit her.

103
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,090
I don't guess you
have that problem, Beth.

104
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,593
I have just as many visitors as I want.

105
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,929
- And you can count on it.
- Like who, for instance?

106
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,515
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

107
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,101
How can I find out,
if you won't tell me?

108
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:54,773
Jim Younger, there are some things
that a man does not ask a lady.

109
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,611
Beth, when you're old enough to call
yourself a lady, I'll keep that in mind.

110
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,326
Think maybe we oughta get married?
Is that what you want?

111
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,707
It seems that you proposed to me
durin' the war, about seven years ago.

112
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,667
That was different.

113
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,711
Except, uh...

114
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,633
..I always knew that...
you were the one.

115
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,594
I just didn't have nothin'
worked out, that's all.

116
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,764
That's a mouthful for Mr. Jesse James.

117
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,350
Well, it's a mouthful of truth.

118
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,770
What you gotta decide is if you
wanna get on the horse with me.

119
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:38,399
I'm gonna be honest about it, Zee.
I ain't gonna change the way I live.

120
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:46,241
Well, it ain't right
to try to change a person.

121
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,703
Truth is, Jesse,
I wouldn't like you any other way.

122
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,343
Next thing you know,
they'll get married and settle down.

123
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,975
First part, anyway.
He's askin' her today.

124
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,148
It doesn't go with the way he's livin'.

125
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,150
He'll be fine.

126
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,488
First gettin' shot,
then gettin' married...

127
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,449
Bad habits.

128
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:33,538
I'd like to have a white dress
and a proper weddin'.

129
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:39,544
- You want the whole county to be there.
- I do. A girl only gets married once.

130
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,565
Yah!

131
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,904
Giddyap!

132
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,916
I never was the marryin' kind, myself.

133
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,251
Kind of life I lead,
women spell trouble.

134
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,171
Footloose and fancy-free,
that's my style.

135
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:27,258
- What about you, friend?
- I ain't felt the call yet.

136
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:31,429
But if I was to meet a girl as pretty
as this one here, I could be persuaded.

137
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:36,184
I tell you something, mister. You best
watch your mouth, not look at my wife.

138
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,604
Sorry. Didn't mean no disrespect.

139
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,231
Course he didn't.
He was just being polite.

140
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,233
Hey, old man, put a cork in it a while.

141
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,195
Vernon, be polite.

142
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,803
Goddamn outlaws.

143
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,472
Vernon, why don't you
hand that over here?

144
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,433
Damn, you son of a bitch,
you're in it with 'em!

145
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,776
I would toss that shotgun away.

146
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,744
Throw down the box.

147
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,513
- You men fight for the Stars and Bars?
- Yes, sir. Proud of it.

148
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,684
- May I shake your hand? Bob Younger.
- George. George Arthur.

149
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,353
- Who were you with, George?
- General Jo Shelby.

150
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,605
What about you?

151
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,026
- I was with Shelby too.
- Where?

152
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,193
Cold Harbor.

153
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,572
Shelby weren't at Cold Harbor.
You're a goddamn liar!

154
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:17,160
- Shall I kill him?
- I would. I'd shoot the son of a bitch.

155
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,373
- Bob, take everything he has.
- Everything.

156
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,044
Let me give you a hand.
You're lucky you ain't dead.

157
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:30,339
Hope we didn't disturb you too much,

313
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,094
Sure I do.

314
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,930
A lot of 'em around these parts.

315
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,182
Big family.

316
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,561
- Who are you fellas?
- Come here to buy cattle.

317
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,858
This ain't Texas.

318
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,070
What about the Youngers?

319
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:20,450
You're lookin' at two of 'em.
You ain't here to buy cattle.

320
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,202
Now who are you fellas?

321
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,455
Goddamn Pinkertons!

322
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,835
- Which Younger are you?
- Question is, who are you?

323
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,131
I told ya. We're cattle buyers.

324
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,884
How dumb do you think we are?
You're Pinkerton men!

325
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,679
I'm Jim Younger.
This here's my cousin John.

326
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,597
You ain't lookin' for him.
He don't ride with us.

327
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,642
Is that right?

328
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,540
Go! Ha!

329
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:31,021
I told ya he was my cousin.
He never rode with us once.

330
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,481
18 year old, I gotta take him
back to his family, dead.

331
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,901
You broke the law.

332
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,384
People say they got one of the Youngers.

333
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,804
People say they got the wrong Younger.

334
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,615
All right, everybody ready?
Wait for 'em to come out.

335
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,547
God...

336
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,187
- What in the hell happened?
- I don't know.

337
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,314
We put a smoke in the cabin.

338
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,441
All of a sudden it blew.

339
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,695
The only thing we meant to do
was drive 'em out to us.

340
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,658
- Now you are sure it was not a bomb?
- Oh, no, it wasn't no bomb.

341
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:12,622
The old lady must have thrown it in
her fireplace and the kerosene went up.

342
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,249
That's the only thing I can figure.

343
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:18,420
Killing a simple-minded,
15-year-old boy.

344
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:22,299
You men did an excellent job in making
heroes out of every one of those men.

345
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,015
Archie Peyton Samuel
was an innocent boy.

346
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,561
It's a sad day when murder is committed
in the name of justice.

347
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:03,483
This act tries the forbearance
of good Christian men.

348
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,278
We commend
this child's body to the ground.

349
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,448
His soul belongs to the Lord.

350
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,759
Beth... Ed.

351
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,221
You didn't bring no gun.

352
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,017
I ain't got no quarrel
with the Pinkertons.

353
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:24,272
I'm sorry about what
happened to Archie, but, uh...

354
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:28,610
..since you boys kicked me out,
you can just fight your own fights.

355
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,363
Is that how you feel about it, Beth?

356
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,330
- No, it ain't.
- Come on. I've had enough talkin' here.

357
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,165
You go your own way.

358
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,836
Now you hold it.
You gotta learn to mind me.

359
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,421
Ed,...

360
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,382
..start walkin'.

361
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,478
Is that what you want, Beth?

362
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,653
Then to hell with you.

363
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,451
To hell with both of you.

364
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,476
Awful sorry about
your little brother. Sorry.

365
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,656
Just rest now. We're gonna take you
over to Schofield's house directly.

366
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:00,743
I'm sorry, Ma.

367
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,788
I'm so sorry.

368
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,543
Are you gonna make 'em pay, Jesse?

369
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,806
You got it wrong.

370
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,476
- We didn't do nothin'.
- Yes, you did.

371
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,146
Some of our friends saw you
on the north road that night.

372
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:15,985
Please, mister, it wasn't really a bomb.
It was supposed to smoke everybody out.

373
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,910
My little brother was 15 years old.

374
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,412
Now you think about that...

375
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,374
..on your way to hell.

376
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:48,267
The funeral will be in Chicago
and the governor will be there.

377
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,938
Well, I'm sure it'll cheer their souls
just to hear you say that.

378
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,982
It'd cheer them to know how many men
we have out combin' those hills.

379
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,903
Those boys got
a lot of friends out there.

380
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,564
What are these two doin' here?

381
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,651
Visitin'. You got a law against that?

382
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,404
No, ma'am. I got a law against murder.

383
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,239
I got a warrant right here.

384
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,075
I don't suppose it'd do me
any good to ask polite.

385
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,036
It won't do you any good to ask at all.

386
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:53,458
These men of yours are gonna end up
dead. Or they're gonna end up worse.

387
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,211
You ladies are gonna be left
all alone just to think about it.

388
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,506
Mr. Rowe!

389
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,218
I want people in the house
and in the wood!

390
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,721
All right, men, off your horses.
Let's go.

391
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,859
(cock crows)

392
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,328
Sooey! Sooey!

393
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,883
Mornin', boys.

394
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,220
Mornin', Cole.

395
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,143
You boys waste the best part of the day.

396
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,064
Hard to say y'all farm-bred
the way you sleep in.

397
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,691
What's for breakfast?

398
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:03,069
Grits. Cracklin' grits.

399
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,029
Had 'em yesterday.

400
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,535
- I'm sick of this damn hidin' out.
- Who ain't?

401
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,747
Better mind your manners, Bob.
And thank McCorkindale here.

402
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,666
Don't be pickin' on Bob, Jesse.

403
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,336
- Hey, shut up, Jim.
- Shut up yourself, Frank.

404
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,964
I ain't got nothin' but respect
for Mr. McCorkindale.

405
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,261
You boys just got holed-up fever,
I know it.

406
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,638
All y'all need is some fresh air.

407
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,517
I'll get y'all some milk
as soon as I feed the chickens.

408
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,150
(braying)

409
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,777
(gunshot)

410
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,934
- What about McCorkindale?
- Dead.

411
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,312
- You sure?
- He's dead.

412
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,813
Piss on ya.

413
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,029
Cover him, dammit!

414
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,723
Next volley, we go.
Frank's hurt. He goes first.

415
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:37,575
# Where there's no more
stormy clouds arising

416
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:43,998
# He whom I fix my hopes upon

417
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:50,046
# Where there's no more
stormy clouds arising

418
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,841
# His track I'll see

419
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,260
# And I'll pursue

420
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,012
# Where there's no more...

421
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:02,767
What is your full name, Mrs. Samuel?
My paper would like to get it right.

422
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,520
Zerelda Cole Samuel.

423
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,900
My husband, Robert James,
died in California.

424
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,237
My second husband
was called Reuben Samuel.

425
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,908
And where did you and Mr. Samuel live?

426
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,827
Clay County, Missouri.

427
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,080
Are you the mother of Jesse James?

428
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,249
I am.

429
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:32,421
# Track I'll see and I'll pursue

430
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:36,509
# Where there's no more stormy clouds...

431
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,346
Mrs. Samuel,
you've already lost one son.

432
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:45,184
Aren't you afraid the other two will
end up the same as McCorkindale?

433
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,745
Ed, you identify the James boys or
the Youngers, there might be a reward.

434
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,585
- How much?
- A couple of thousand dollars.

435
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,881
Shit.

436
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:20,136
Well, I got a question for you.

437
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,639
How do I identify what you can't catch?

438
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,642
They'll be caught. Jesse and his boys
are done with you anyway.

439
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,895
Let me tell you one damn thing.

440
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,608
I turn 'em in and I'm gonna get killed
by one of their relatives, sure as hell.

441
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:38,112
I got six months to go
for bustin' up a place drunk,...

442
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,573
..so I'm just gonna
take my chances, all right?

443
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:46,704
Besides, Jesse might change his mind
and he pays better wages than you do,...

444
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,789
..Pinkerton man.

445
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,380
Frank, I never
saw myself as a farm girl.

446
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:59,675
You ain't gonna be farmin', Annie.
You're gonna raise horses.

447
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,678
I don't know anythin'
about raisin' horses, either.

448
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:04,930
You know, it's funny.
Outside of bein' a banker,...

449
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,225
..all I wanted to do
was to raise horses.

450
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:11,270
Well, thanks to the Pinkertons,
you're gettin' your chance.

451
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:16,525
We're not the only ones goin'
our own way. Everybody's doin' it.

452
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:20,654
Jim Younger's off in the hills.
God only knows where Jesse is.

453
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,781
Bob and Cole are headin' for Texas.

454
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,034
The only reason
Cole went to Texas

455
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:28,037
was he heard Belle Shirley
got married there.

456
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:32,583
It's a long way to go lookin' for
trouble. We'll be just fine, Annie.

457
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,460
Come on, mule!

458
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:40,299
(# country music)

459
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,436
You're late.

460
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,398
I'm not much for bein' on time.

461
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,901
You don't look real happy.

462
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:43,737
Well, I'll tell ya somethin'
about Texas.

463
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,322
It's loud.

464
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,409
Well, I never figured you
for the homesick type.

465
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,830
I ain't the homesick type.
I ain't the waitin' around type, either.

466
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:55,457
I ain't the reliable type.

467
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,127
Well, you oughta try gettin' married.

468
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,130
Might improve your character.

469
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:04,133
What do you do with that...
husband of yours?

470
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,802
Leave him home, tied to the bed?

471
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,054
Don't you make no fun of him.

472
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:13,475
The way I got it figured,
you're gonna wear that Indian out.

473
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,021
That double thump
and side swoop of yours.

474
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,733
I do what I want with who I want
and don't make no mistake about it.

475
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,193
Everybody says that
and they always have.

476
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:29,158
Now you wanna see somethin',
you watch this.

477
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,617
Come here!

478
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,544
- You done?
- Not by a damn sight.

479
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:46,842
(music stops)

480
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,061
Now are you done?

481
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,438
(gunshot)

482
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,111
Sam.

483
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,531
You Cole Younger?

484
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,241
Who's askin'?

485
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,788
Sam Starr. I'm married to that lady.

486
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,582
Pleased to meet ya.

487
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,713
Well now, boys, there is no need
to fight over little old me.

488
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,258
But if you've got to,
you make it man-to-man.

489
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,846
Hand-to-hand.

490
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,143
Why not?

491
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,613
Well,...

492
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,617
..I'm glad I caught ya in a good mood.

493
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:09,633
Here you go, both of you. Have a chew.

494
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:15,389
- What does the winner get?
- Nothin' you both ain't already had.

495
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,811
It don't make much sense, does it?

496
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,149
No. You're both crazy.

497
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,694
But you keep me occupied.

498
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,781
I am having a real good time.

499
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,745
Ten bucks on the half-breed!

500
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,659
Come on, redskin!

501
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,017
Come on, Missouri.

502
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,743
What's the matter?

503
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,416
You got what you wanted.

504
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,228
(# music strikes up)

505
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:02,157
- Sir, we met a few months back.
- I remember.

506
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,534
I'd like to ask you a couple
of questions for my newspaper,

507
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,994
if you don't mind.

508
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:10,123
Like why you're havin' so much trouble
bringin' in the James-Younger gang.

509
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:16,129
A lot of reasons. I came here with
four men that didn't know the territory.

510
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,714
They were murdered.

511
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:21,510
Most of the people here are related
to each other, so they're clannish.

512
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:23,387
What about the local police?

513
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:27,265
Local police get tired and quit
after chasin' the gang a coupla miles.

514
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,354
Also, newspapers like your own print
lies, sayin' they're Robin Hoods.

515
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,481
That doesn't help a great deal, either.

516
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,693
My readers may ask why
you're sittin' next to a warm fire...

517
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,361
..when you should be out on the chase.

518
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:43,323
Right now the bunch
are spread out across five states.

519
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,117
But they will be back.

520
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:37,085
Zee, did you have
any visitors while I was gone?

521
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,255
You mean was anyone

522
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:43,300
tryin' to straighten up your sheets
and fluff your pillow?

523
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:47,429
- I'm just askin'.
- Mind your manners, Mr. Jesse James.

524
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,431
Just 'cause you're off fightin'
railroads and banks,

525
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,933
don't mean you get a free tongue.

526
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:58,523
I sent out word to the rest.
We're gonna be meetin' up real soon.

527
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,318
We're goin' on a mission.

528
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:06,031
I'm gonna get myself some cash...

529
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:11,411
..and start lookin' around Missouri
for some girl to marry.

530
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,207
Any prospects?

531
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,710
I'm lookin'.

532
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,517
I don't know, Annie.

533
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,312
Maybe we're just goin'
in different directions.

534
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:42,567
Maybe so. Can't help
wantin' what we want, can we?

535
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:45,028
Yeah.

536
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:51,701
Well, my going's got
nothin' to do with big dreams.

537
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,746
Nobody ever made you go
anywhere you didn't wanna go, Frank.

538
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,586
Good night.

539
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,608
- How are you doin', Jim?
- I'm doin' OK.

540
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,078
So, gents, let's get down to it.

541
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,330
What's our next job gonna be?

542
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:45,714
Minnesota. Them squareheads,
they got 'em a real fat bank up there.

543
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,677
I scouted it out myself. Northfield.

544
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:57,142
A lot of banks and cathouses
in Missouri we ain't done.

545
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:02,564
Cole's right. Minnesota...

546
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,191
It's a fair piece off our mark.

547
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:10,447
Well, Clell says that bank's full to the
brim with money. That sounds good to me.

548
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:11,656
(door opens)

549
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:18,914
I want Bill Chadwell and Charley Pitts
to go with us. They're goddamn good men.

550
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:22,751
- Who says?
- I do.

551
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,058
I used to do this all the time.

552
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,144
But, uh...

553
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:28,066
I got married a few years back.

554
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:33,989
I guess it slowed me down a bit,
if you know what I mean.

555
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,266
Mornin', Jess.

556
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:09,190
Hope you boys
had a good time last night.

557
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,443
How was yours?

558
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,612
I got better things to think about.

559
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,118
Family man.

560
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:25,790
My family's somethin'
you don't talk about, Cole Younger.

561
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,085
# Well, I walked the street
with a tap to my feet

562
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,754
# Heard a voice above me

563
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:15,090
# A maid looked out
from a window up above

564
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,717
# Said need somebody to love me

565
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:20,095
# My father he's a minister

566
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,597
# And virgins he doth cherish

567
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:25,100
# Now she got five boys
and seven little girls

568
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,977
# And a baby on her shoulder

569
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,450
Well, Frank, when this is all over,
I think I'll write me a book.

570
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,578
Make myself
even more famous than I am.

571
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,707
If a pig had wings, it would fly.

572
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,087
Nah. A book about my exploits...

573
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,215
..as a gentleman and a lover.

574
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:02,387
- I expect a free copy.
- Free copy?

575
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,853
You gotta pay, Frank. Gotta pay.

576
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,024
Have you ever been up north before?

577
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,193
Got to Fetterman once.

578
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:20,822
- Went to shoot buffalo.
- How'd you do?

579
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:24,784
The price of hides went to hell
and I got the clap off some squaw.

580
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,381
The bank's plumb in the center
of town,...

581
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:23,718
..right between the dry goods store
and the mortuary.

582
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:28,264
You reckon we oughta send in
a coupla scouts, check it all out?

583
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:31,351
We rob banks, Jim.
We don't need any checkin'.

584
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:34,437
You're talkin' soft,
somethin' I'd expect from Cole or Frank.

585
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:38,858
I gave up tryin' to talk
sense to you a long time ago.

586
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,578
Come on, let's take the damn bank.

587
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,498
There ain't nothin' over there
but squareheads.

588
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,443
(steam engine whistle)

589
01:14:03,021 --> 01:14:04,981
All right, good people, nobody move.

590
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:08,734
Let's just show God
the palms of our hands.

591
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,028
Now you don't give us
no trouble, mister.

592
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,822
Clell, get to the vault.

593
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:23,624
- Är den här hästen till salu?
- He's not for sale.

594
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,084
Move on, squarehead.

595
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:35,470
OK, now you open this safe
or I'll blow your head right off.

596
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,597
I can't. It's a time lock.

597
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:43,436
- What are you talkin' about?
- Time lock, hell!

598
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,521
You open that safe, mister, you hear?

599
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,525
The Pinkertons told us
you might be comin'.

600
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,695
The lock is set just for you.
It only works at 4:30.

601
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,656
The whole town is ready.

602
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:10,213
No, mister, please don't shoot.
I have a family.

603
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,133
Now, you got five seconds
to open up that vault, mister.

604
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:18,721
Hur mycket ska ni ha för den?

605
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:21,224
What the hell...? Get outta here!

606
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:26,229
Det var synd. Det var eu vacker häst.

607
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:31,484
- (woman screams)
- Be quiet, lady!

608
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:36,447
(woman screams)

609
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:39,367
- They're robbin' the bank!
- Jesus, Clell!

610
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:42,620
They're robbin' the bank!

611
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:09,272
- Let's get the hell outta here.
- Come on, Clell.

612
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,165
Yankee bastard!

613
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:36,507
Jim!

614
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,926
Bob!

615
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:14,725
Cole! Jesse!

616
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,319
We gotta move, Frank.

617
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:34,365
They'll get the rest of 'em to a doctor.

618
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:40,287
- Who will?
- The posse that's gonna be chasin' us.

619
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:44,333
We can't do that.
We can’t just leave 'em here alone.

620
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:02,059
Jim, Cole,...

621
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,647
..we gotta ride.

622
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:11,819
What about the rest of 'em?

623
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:14,530
This just ain't no time
to argue, Cole.

624
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:20,160
Either you stay here an' die
or you come with us.

625
01:23:21,913 --> 01:23:23,414
Frank an' I are goin'.

626
01:23:51,609 --> 01:23:54,737
Kill me! Kill me, goddamn it!

627
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:56,989
Frank.

628
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,912
You're not leavin', are ya?

629
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,669
I gotta stick with my brother, Cole.

630
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,151
The Youngers don't need you.

631
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,029
I like it better this way, Jesse.

632
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,574
I get to see you run.

633
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:08,245
Jim... Oh, Cole!

634
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:12,291
Yeah, we're here, Bobby boy.
We're all here.

635
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,670
Goddamn squareheads.

636
01:26:38,818 --> 01:26:40,903
Where the hell's Missouri?

637
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,284
Come on, Frank.

638
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:14,871
We're gonna get us a new gang together.
It's gonna be better than ever.

639
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:17,833
Now you're not gonna quit on me now.

640
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:22,963
All we gotta do is get across the river.

641
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:25,340
All we gotta do is get home.

642
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,220
We never shoulda left.

643
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:17,601
You could say we was drove to it.

644
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:22,272
Oh? How's that?

645
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:26,568
If it weren't for the war,
we might have been somethin' else.

646
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:31,531
You're a little too young
to have fought in the war.

647
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:35,369
But my brothers weren't,
and we all go one direction together.

648
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:38,372
You tell me who they are
and it might mean a lighter sentence.

649
01:29:38,456 --> 01:29:39,873
Think about that.

650
01:29:39,957 --> 01:29:42,667
You and I both know it was
the James boys, don't we, Cole?

651
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:45,462
Sure do feel poorly.

652
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:50,217
Ain't a surprise. Eleven bullets
must be some kinda record.

653
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:53,720
What do you think about a life sentence?

654
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,014
You're lucky they don't allow
hangin' in this state.

655
01:29:57,683 --> 01:30:00,227
Come on, Cole.
Tell me what you think about all this.

656
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,318
Oh, hell, we played a rough game.

657
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,028
We lost.

658
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,116
I spent four years in the army.

659
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:16,952
Eleven tryin' to get out of it.

660
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:20,372
What about the James boys?

661
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,001
- I don't know nothin' about 'em.
- Sure you do.

662
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,840
As far as I'm concerned,
they never been in this state.

663
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:45,355
Are you another reporter?

664
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:49,776
No. My name's Jacob Rixley.
I'm with the Pinkerton agency.

665
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,404
I been chasin' you boys
for a long time, Bob.

666
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:55,240
Yes, sir, I guess you have.

667
01:30:55,992 --> 01:30:58,118
I wanna talk to you
about the James boys.

668
01:30:58,202 --> 01:31:00,454
You don't owe them a thing, you know.

669
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:03,957
If it was them, they wouldn't
protect you to get them one day less.

670
01:31:04,041 --> 01:31:06,835
But unless you help me,

671
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,046
you and your brothers
are gonna be in this jail for life.

672
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,800
(Jim) Uh-uh.

673
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,679
What's he tryin' to say?

674
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:22,559
He said to tell you we done it
for Dixie and nothin' else.

675
01:31:25,104 --> 01:31:27,314
15,000 for Jesse.

676
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:29,733
Another 10,000 will get you Frank.

677
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:34,905
The Pinkerton company and
the governor can't afford that.

678
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:39,743
You know who you're talkin' to?
You know who sprung out of Missouri?

679
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,746
Jameses, Youngers, Clantons, Earps.

680
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:45,373
And now Bob and Charlie Ford.

681
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:48,168
Word's out that you and Jesse
aren't friends, anyway.

682
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:52,172
Is that so? Well,
that very same Mr. Jesse James...

683
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:55,217
..that you can't find at all
just asked us to come and visit him.

684
01:31:57,970 --> 01:31:59,638
Let's go, Bob.

685
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:02,265
Wait a minute.

686
01:32:03,434 --> 01:32:05,227
$15,000.

687
01:32:06,103 --> 01:32:08,104
Half before and half when it's done.

688
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,774
Got yourself a deal.

689
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:18,490
No more for me.

690
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:24,579
Heard you were thinkin'
about a bank in Kansas, Jesse.

691
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:27,958
You don't talk business
at the table, Bob.

692
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:30,794
Sorry.

693
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:37,676
Say, how'd you boys like a drink?

694
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,636
Sounds good.

695
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:43,390
- Don't it, Bob?
- Sure thing.

696
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:47,060
Could I have your plate, please, Jesse?

697
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:52,941
Charlie.

698
01:33:03,953 --> 01:33:07,497
- Are you feelin' all right?
- She ain't real fond of the company.

699
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:12,627
Don't worry none, ladies.

700
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:15,297
Just talkin' some things over,
that's all.

701
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:26,558
Can you say good night?

702
01:33:26,642 --> 01:33:28,435
Good night.

703
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:40,071
He might be carryin' a hide-out.
I bet he is.

704
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:44,909
He knows. I know he knows.

705
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:52,208
Pour me one, Bob.

706
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,548
You look spooked, Charlie.

707
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:01,593
Like hell.

708
01:34:02,511 --> 01:34:04,721
Nothin' spooks me, Jesse.
You know that.

709
01:34:09,518 --> 01:34:12,270
Now I've been thinkin'
about the Platte City bank.

710
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:14,731
It's gonna be a big one.

711
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,274
We ain't too sure.

712
01:34:17,276 --> 01:34:20,111
- Why not?
- I don't know.

713
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:22,906
You're a hard man
to do business with, Jesse.

714
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:28,620
It's crooked.

715
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,330
What'd you say?

716
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:33,541
I said, it's not straight.

717
01:34:39,590 --> 01:34:41,633
I really like this old sampler.

718
01:34:42,301 --> 01:34:44,636
Ma gave this to me for my weddin' day.

719
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:50,100
Is that straight?

720
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,395
I shot Jesse James.

721
01:35:00,486 --> 01:35:03,154
- Mr. Rixley?
- That's right.

722
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:06,116
My name is Frank James.

723
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:11,121
I came here to turn myself in.

724
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:14,999
Here's my gun.

725
01:35:16,627 --> 01:35:18,336
I want something in return.

726
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:22,632
I want to be able to bury my brother.

727
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:26,803
Suppose I don't agree to your terms.

728
01:35:29,181 --> 01:35:30,348
I'll kill you.

729
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,934
# Jesse James we understand

730
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:40,270
# Has killed a many man

731
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:44,732
# He robbed the Union trains

732
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:47,610
# But history does record

733
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:49,696
# That Bob and Charlie Ford

734
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:54,284
# Have laid Jesse James in his grave

735
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:56,619
# It was on a Saturday night

736
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:58,955
# The stars were shinin' bright

737
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:03,042
# When they robbed that Union train

738
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:05,879
# And it was one of the Younger boys

739
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:08,298
# That gathered in the spoils

740
01:38:08,382 --> 01:38:12,135
# And carried that money away

741
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:39,037
# In his small home unaware

742
01:38:39,121 --> 01:38:41,414
# A-straightenin' pictures there

743
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:45,418
# He thought he heard a noise

744
01:38:45,502 --> 01:38:48,171
# And as he turned his head

745
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:50,381
# Well, a bullet killed him dead

746
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:54,177
# Fired by Bob Ford, one of the boys

747
01:38:55,429 --> 01:38:59,724
# For Jesse had a wife,
she lived a lady all her life

748
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:03,686
# The children they were brave

749
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:06,814
# But history does record

750
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:09,192
# That Bob and Charlie Ford

751
01:39:09,276 --> 01:39:12,195
# Have laid poor Jesse

752
01:39:12,279 --> 01:39:15,198
# Laid poor Jesse

753
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:18,326
# Have laid Jesse James

754
01:39:18,410 --> 01:39:22,664
# In his grave
