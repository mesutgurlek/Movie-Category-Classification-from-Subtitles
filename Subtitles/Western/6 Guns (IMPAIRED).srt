472
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,537
Will Stevens, right?

473
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:22,407
You knew him?

474
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:25,143
Knew of him.
Lawman out of Texas.

475
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:31,516
Would you like
a cup of coffee?

476
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:35,320
That'd be nice.
Thank you.

477
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,334
Thank you.

478
00:42:54,673 --> 00:43:00,311
All those years married
to a lawman, he never
taught you how to shoot?

479
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:02,313
Wasn't no need to.

480
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:06,852
But now there is?

481
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,021
Why's that?

482
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,659
I ain't got no one
protectin' me anymore.

483
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,927
Fair enough.

484
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:20,465
First things first.
Your grip.

485
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,467
Gotta be tight.
Can't have a lose hand.

486
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:26,437
You got a lose hand,
you ain't gonna hit
anything.

487
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:29,040
I said tight.

488
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:33,244
Alright?

489
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,714
And hold it out there.
Don't lock your elbow,

490
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:37,548
But don't bend it
too much, either.

491
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,218
It'll kick right
back and hit you
in the face.

492
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:43,488
Knew a feller broke
his nose like that
once in a gunfight.

493
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:45,423
Made a mess.

494
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,458
Look right down
your arm.

495
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:49,961
Down the sight there.
Down it.

496
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,098
Pull the trigger?

497
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:56,301
No. Not yet.
Let's start over.

498
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,736
Why?

499
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:59,971
Pullin' the trigger's
the easy part.

500
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:04,475
Learnin' how to draw and aim,
that's the rough part.
So we're gonna do it over, and...

501
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:08,346
I don't need to learn that.
I need to learn how to shoot,
Frank.

502
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:12,217
Won't make any difference. You
don't learn how to draw properly
you'll be dead already.

503
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:16,922
I don't need to learn how to
draw. I need to learn how to
kill a man!

504
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,792
Alright then.

505
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:30,135
If you can draw quicker,
shoot before me, then you're
ready to practice shooting.

506
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:38,243
What're you waitin' for?
Holster that weapon!
When you're ready, draw.

507
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,946
If you beat me,
shoot me dead.

508
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,581
(GUN SLIDING
INTO HOLSTER)

509
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:45,851
I'm not gonna
tell you again.

510
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:54,025
Look. I've never shot
a woman before. I'm not
plannin' on doin' it now.

511
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:57,695
But if you're gonna
be stubborn, you best
beat me to the draw

512
00:44:57,763 --> 00:45:00,398
If you want me to keep
practicing with you.

513
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,479
BANG!

514
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,960
Where are you going?
We're done.

515
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:31,162
What do you mean
"we're done?"

516
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,597
Just that.

517
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:37,302
Wait! Wait, where
do you think you're
going?!

518
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:38,636
Wait!

519
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:42,473
Wait, Mr. Allison,
will you just wait for
one moment?

520
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,376
Where are you going?!
Mr. Allison, where are...?

521
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:49,247
I said I was sorry!
I'm sorry, okay?
I will listen to you!

522
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:54,185
Just wait! MR. ALLISON!
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!

523
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,764
KNOCK, KNOCK,
KNOCK, KNOCK!
Frank, you in there?!

524
00:46:06,832 --> 00:46:10,335
Frank?!
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!

525
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:14,339
(PANTING)
Frank. They're comin' back.
They killed Deputy Thompson.

526
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:17,575
They killed him
and his whole posse
on the Old Spanish Trail.

527
00:46:17,642 --> 00:46:20,545
They're killin' everybody,
Frank. Everybody in their path.

528
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,147
Who's that, Sheriff?

529
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:24,782
Lee Horn!

530
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:27,886
(PANTING)
What're we gonna do?

531
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:30,088
What're we gonna do, Frank?

532
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,563
How many men can
you round up?

533
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,967
Oh, I don't know.
Folks are scared to death

534
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:45,871
After what Lee
Horn's gang done
to Selina and her family.

535
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,572
How many?

536
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,108
I think none, Frank.

537
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:54,079
Reckon it'll just
have to be you
and me, then.

538
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,313
Ah, now, hold
on now.

539
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,748
Why don't I get on
the wire to Tucson?

540
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,584
See if I can get
us some help.

541
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,054
Get on the wire, then.
But if Horn gets here
before help arrives,

542
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:05,323
We better be ready
for 'em.

543
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:06,992
Gonna go wire.

544
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,003
*

545
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:27,278
*

546
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,148
(FOOTSTEPS)

547
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:08,219
(FOOTSTEPS)

548
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,157
(CLICK)

549
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,593
It's a good way
to get yourself killed.

550
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:21,599
Thought you
were leaving.

551
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:24,202
What are you
doin' here?

552
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:30,175
I want you to finish
teachin' me
how to shoot.

553
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,348
Well?

554
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,055
I'll be back
by tomorrow.

555
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:55,700
Now, this holster,
you're gonna have to pull
straight up and out.

556
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,370
Or else it's
gonna hang up
every time. Try it.

557
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,942
Alright, well,
let's try shooting,
alright?

558
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,246
Remember, arm out in
front, both eyes open.

559
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:11,782
Don't cross in front
of your body, or you
won't shoot straight.

560
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:14,785
Now, we're gonna
squeeze the trigger.
Don't yank it.

561
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:17,155
But make it
one fluid motion.

562
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:19,991
Don't pull it halfway.
Commit to it.

563
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,294
BANG!

564
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,230
You yanked.

565
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:28,499
No, I didn't.
I squeezed!
You yanked!

566
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,638
Okay. Okay.

567
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,640
Can I try again?

568
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,844
BANG!

569
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,980
Give you somethin'
to shoot at.
Maybe that'll help.

570
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:55,326
Try and remember
everything I told you.

571
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:57,295
(CLICK)

572
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:03,068
BANG!

573
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:07,905
You expected to hit it?

574
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,774
Yes.

575
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,044
Take you a hundred tries.
And that's if you're lucky.

576
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:19,384
What are you waitin' for?
You got three more shots
in that gun. Shoot.

577
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,986
CLICK

578
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,255
BANG!

579
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:28,359
BANG!

580
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,100
BANG!

581
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,277
Alright. You're reloaded.

582
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,182
CLICK

583
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,519
BANG!

584
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,756
You know, you're
holdin' your breath.

585
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,191
No.

586
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:04,362
I told you it would
take a while.

587
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:06,664
Yeah. You said that
already.

588
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:14,439
How many men
have you killed?

589
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,246
Twelve. I've killed
twelve men.

590
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,850
Is it hard?
To shoot someone?

591
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:32,723
Shootin' them
is not hard. Killing 'em
is something else entirely.

592
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,998
But you only kill a man
when he tries to kill you.

593
00:51:41,065 --> 00:51:43,201
Or if maybe he
deserves to die?

594
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:47,638
Wouldn't be my right
to judge that.

595
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:52,443
But what if they'd done
something... so horrible
that...

596
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:56,247
Like what Lee Horn
did to you?

597
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:01,519
Yes.

598
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:05,790
Be my duty
to turn 'em over
to the law.

599
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:09,160
But what if it
was YOUR family,
YOUR life?

600
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:15,433
You'd kill 'em,
Mr. Allison.
You know you would.

601
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:21,138
Yeah. Yeah,
I'd kill 'em.

602
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:24,442
CLICK

603
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,446
BANG!
Damn it!

604
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:40,325
See you tomorrow morning?

605
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:46,564
I ain't learned to shoot yet.

606
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:49,434
All day, and I didn't
hit a damn bottle.

607
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,636
Said you'd teach me to shoot.

608
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:54,705
Tomorrow, then.

609
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:25,736
BANG!

610
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:30,741
BANG!

611
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,512
Whoa.

612
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,487
BANG!

613
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:48,693
BANG!

614
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:54,732
BANG!

615
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,569
Nice shooting.

616
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,512
Frank!

617
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,784
Selina, how are you?

618
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:21,392
Frank, can I, can I talk
to you for a minute?

619
00:54:21,459 --> 00:54:24,495
Why don't you reload
and keep practicin'?

620
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:32,236
BANG!

621
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,271
Tucson dispatched
a couple of U.S. Marshalls

622
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:38,576
And a couple of deputies
to come out here,
after they got my wire.

623
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:43,080
Well, got word
that they found Lee Horn.

624
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:47,518
So they set up a whole ambush
in this place called "Dog Creek"

625
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:49,587
On the Gila Trail,
about two days ago.

626
00:54:49,654 --> 00:54:51,221
Yeah. I know
the place.

627
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:56,093
Well... a mail messenger

Who?

629
00:54:57,362 --> 00:55:00,465
The two U.S. Marshalls
and the deputies!

630
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:04,569
The Gila Trail, that
hits the main road
into town?

631
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:10,375
Yeah, well, any idea how
soon they'd be here if they
was to come from Dog Creek?

632
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:13,978
About two days,
I reckon.

633
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,514
What about Tucson?
They sending anyone?

634
00:55:16,581 --> 00:55:20,317
Oh, nah. They got... they got
half a regiment

635
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:23,253
Chasing some Apaches
up the side of a mountain.

636
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,457
They said they can't
spare anyone for week.

637
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:28,258
Anyone else you
can call on?

638
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:33,531
Well, that would be
Deputy Thompson,
but Lee killed him.

639
00:55:33,598 --> 00:55:37,668
They're all dead, Frank.
There ain't nobody left!

640
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,904
Lee Horn done
killed 'em all!

641
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,009
So what're we gonna do?

642
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,582
BANG!

643
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,961
Why don't you
stay here tonight?

644
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,329
Pardon?

645
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:07,598
You're just gonna be back
here in the morning.

646
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:10,668
Put down your things.
I'll make us some supper.

647
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:30,555
Don't reckon I've ever had
a roast this good before.

648
00:56:32,156 --> 00:56:34,959
Pot roast was
Will's favorite.

649
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:38,395
He'd eat it every day.
Breakfast, lunch and supper.

650
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:45,002
Stick his nose in the kitchen,
say, "Cookin' a roast?"

651
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:50,074
Yeah, well... vegetables,
chicken, bread.

652
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,744
He always thought
he smelled a pot roast.

You have everything
you need, Mr. Allison?

me "Frank".

What can I get you?

Get my boys a room.

distance in a gunfight.
That's the idea.

I want you to try
and find a spot.
Fire two shots from cover.

You're moving now.
It takes a lot of practice.

to cover, take a second.
Don't rush your shot.

Know where you're gonna
shoot before you do. See it

942
01:24:12,348 --> 01:24:14,750
But, Frank!
NO!

943
01:24:14,817 --> 01:24:19,788
Horn's a cold killer.
He's not like the others.
He'll hit what he aims at.

944
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:22,825
So stay here, and
stay down.

945
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:26,795
When this is over,
I'll come back for you.

946
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:28,897
Frank?!

947
01:24:28,964 --> 01:24:30,499
Be careful.

948
01:24:50,153 --> 01:24:52,155
CLICK

949
01:25:13,909 --> 01:25:15,844
OHH!

950
01:25:18,147 --> 01:25:19,615
Hello, darlin'.

951
01:25:19,682 --> 01:25:23,752
You're not gonna
be needin' this anymore.

952
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:28,724
Now, who's your friend
out there?

953
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:31,627
Go to hell, you
murdering son of a bitch.

954
01:25:31,694 --> 01:25:34,697
That's the way
you wanna play it.

955
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:40,836
Hello, out there!
I got somethin' I think
you're gonna want!

956
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:45,974
You know, it's a pity
it's come to this.

957
01:25:46,041 --> 01:25:48,677
If my friends had done
what they were
supposed to,

958
01:25:48,744 --> 01:25:52,248
We wouldn't be in
this predicament.

959
01:25:52,315 --> 01:25:55,684
Surely there's a peaceful
resolution we can come to.

960
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:58,554
I got a lot of money,
nobody to share it with.

961
01:25:58,621 --> 01:26:01,190
So let's work something out,
shall we?

962
01:26:01,257 --> 01:26:04,493
The only peaceful resolution
is for you
to throw down your guns

963
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,162
And come out
with your hands up, Lee Horn.

964
01:26:08,297 --> 01:26:10,766
You pompous idiot.

965
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:18,907
I got a better idea.

966
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:22,911
I'm gonna count to five, and
you're gonna put YOUR guns down.

967
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:26,014
Or I'll put a bullet
in her head.

968
01:26:26,081 --> 01:26:29,952
One... two... THREE!

969
01:26:39,962 --> 01:26:44,333
Here I am, Horn. No need
to shoot her. Let her go.

970
01:26:46,969 --> 01:26:50,138
The famous Frank Allison.

971
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,442
Well indeed, sir, it
has been an honor.

972
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,554
BANG!

973
01:27:05,621 --> 01:27:07,022
BANG!

974
01:27:07,089 --> 01:27:10,259
NOOO!
Nooo!

975
01:27:10,326 --> 01:27:11,494
BANG!

976
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,829
(HORN LAUGHS)
BANG!
Nooo!

977
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:20,403
Get in there!

978
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:24,840
Alright, darlin'...

979
01:27:26,842 --> 01:27:31,380
Now I'm gonna finish what
shoulda been finished
a long time ago.

980
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:32,981
Get off me!

981
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:35,250
Just like
the last time.

982
01:27:49,298 --> 01:27:51,066
Go to hell!

983
01:27:51,133 --> 01:27:52,501
BANG!

984
01:28:09,418 --> 01:28:10,953
Frank!

985
01:28:14,457 --> 01:28:16,659
FRANK!
Frank!
Frank.

986
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:28,837
(WEEPS)

987
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:45,788
We got 'em, Will.

988
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:47,890
We killed every last
one of 'em.

989
01:28:47,956 --> 01:28:53,796
May they rot in hell
for what they did to
you and to my boys.

990
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:55,664
We got 'em.

991
01:28:57,132 --> 01:28:59,034
(HORSE HOOVES)

992
01:29:04,006 --> 01:29:05,273
How you feelin'?

993
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,778
Well... this is for you.

994
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:11,079
What is it?

995
01:29:11,146 --> 01:29:13,849
It's the reward money
for Lee Horn and his gang.

996
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:16,885
Lee alone was worth
over $500.

997
01:29:18,954 --> 01:29:24,126
The big one... he never
raped me. Supposed to
kill me, but he didn't.

998
01:29:25,961 --> 01:29:29,565
I reckon' it's better
I killed him then.
Take this.

999
01:29:29,632 --> 01:29:31,467
I can't take it.

1000
01:29:31,534 --> 01:29:35,938
It's a lot of money. You can
rebuild your life. Live easy
for a long time.

1001
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:44,713
Where you headed?

1002
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:49,885
Up to Naco. After a man
for robbin' a bank in Douglas.

1003
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:52,521
And back to Tombstone.

1004
01:29:52,588 --> 01:29:57,460
Is that where you're from?
You got family there?

1005
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:01,129
Yeah.

1006
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:09,171
You take care of yourself,
Mrs. Selena Stevens.

1007
01:30:12,441 --> 01:30:14,176
Hey, Frank.

1008
01:30:15,844 --> 01:30:19,748
You need any help
catching those fellows in Naco?

1009
01:30:19,815 --> 01:30:25,654
No. But if I do,
I know where to find you.
