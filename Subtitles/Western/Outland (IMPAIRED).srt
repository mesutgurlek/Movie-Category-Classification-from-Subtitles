Oh, God.

157
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,967
I just can't take it anymore.
That's what it amounts to.

158
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,347
I know we've been over this
so many times before.

159
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,226
The same crying from me,
and the same assurances from you.

160
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:09,773
That the next place will be different.
But it never is. lt can't be.

161
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,985
So yesterday, something snapped in me.

162
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,155
I just couldn't bear to see Paulie...

163
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,326
...clatter around yet another
bleak place. l just couldn't.

164
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:26,498
He's a child.
He's never set foot on Earth.

165
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,958
Never!

166
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,672
He looks at pictures
and reads books of Earth...

167
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:38,635
...all day long. And he hides them from
you so your feelings won't be hurt.

168
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,763
Don't you see
he deserves a childhood?

169
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:46,518
He deserves a chance
to breathe air, real outside air...

170
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,521
...where you don't broil or explode.

171
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,523
Air that smells like life!

172
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,526
Not like a ventilating unit!

173
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,113
I'm just not as good as you are.

174
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,365
I don't think it's worth it.

175
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,664
So I'm taking Paulie back home.

I love you.

177

You don't deserve this.
You deserve the best.

178
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,137
I've just got to go now, my love.
I'll contact you...

179
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,516
...in a few days from the space station
before we finally leave for Earth.

180
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:45,474
What do we have here?

181
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:47,329
What's happening with
the purser's area?

182
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,081
We've put monitors
on the whole area for 36 hours...

183
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,917
...and things have been quiet.

184
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,336
MONTONE:
Keep the monitors on for two weeks.

185
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:58,924
-And the detonators?
-Oh, they were found.

186
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,133
MONTONE:
Where?

187
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,510
NELSON: I don't know.
The foreman reported them found...

188
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,263
...then told me to forget about it.

189
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:08,934
Nelson, we're talking about
nuclear detonators.

190
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,145
You just don't lose them
and then find them.

191
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,147
You lose your comb, then find it.

192
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,649
Not detonators.

193
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:19,569
I want to know where they were found
and who found them. Get it?

194
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,446
Yes, sir.

195
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,949
Good for you, Nelson.

196
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,787
Slater, what about
the incident in the mine elevator?

197
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,747
Nothing much to tell, Sarge.

198
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:35,502
Some cupcake named Cane decided
he didn't need an environment suit.

199
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,463
They're still sponging him
off the elevator walls.

200
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,549
He was alone. Nobody near enough
to have thrown him in.

201
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,760
Some guys tried
to get into the airlock...

202
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,637
...except he'd sealed it.

203
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:47,806
No way it was homicide.

204
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,892
-Had to have been a suicide.
O'NIEL: Did he leave a note?

205
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:53,895
I beg your pardon?

206
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,522
Did he leave a note?

207
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,732
None that we know of, sir.

208
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,901
Then how do you know it was suicide?

209
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,029
SLATER:
There's no other explanation.

210
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,615
He knew what he was doing,
that's for sure.

211
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,202
You can't fall into an airlock
and then an elevator.

212
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,956
You have to open hatches,
press buttons, close hatches.

213
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,208
It's the only explanation.

214
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,170
Thank you.

215
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,339
Yes, sir.

Okay. Fanning.

217

FANNING: Just a fight.

218
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,558
We took them both in to cool off.
They straightened out soon.

219
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,727
MONTONE: Gil?
GlL: Pretty quiet.

220
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,230
Couple of calls about noise.
Nothing much.

221
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:44,529
Who ordered all these pressure
packs? This is a mine, not a war.

222
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,489
-You did, doctor.
-I said 100...

223
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,491
-...not 1000--
-You said 1000--

224
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,537
I said 100, which can't be mistaken
for anything except 100.

225
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,331
It doesn't sound remotely
like 1,000. Listen!

226
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,877
You'll hear what I mean.
One thousand.

227
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,962
One hundred.

228
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:02,672
Totally different.

229
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,800
You think they sound the same?
Who are you, anyway?

230

Yes. I'd like to talk to you.

I got an alibi. Four people will swear
we were playing poker.

00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:18,730
O'NIEL:
I never heard that one before.

236
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,066
-That's really funny.
LAZARUS: Sorry.

237
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:25,320
Yesterday, a man went into the
atmosphere without his pressure suit.

238
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:26,654
Yes.

239
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,492
A couple of days before, another
man cut his suit open on purpose.

240
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,202
It happens here.

How often?

242
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,749
-I don't know. It just happens here.
-Why?

243
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,251
I'm not a psychiatrist.
I can't tell you why.

244
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,879
Some people can't take it
here after awhile.

245
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,881
-Did you do autopsies?
-No.

246
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,132
Why not?

247
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,885
The Company wanted the bodies
shipped out quickly.

himself to zero-pressure atmosphere...
