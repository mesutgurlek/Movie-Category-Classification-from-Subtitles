something more like... this.

In case you haven't
heard, this undertaking

is being subsidized by
the enormous teat of

It's bewitching.

220
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:37,704
It hasn't changed
since Lewis and Clark
first saw it 60 years ago.

221
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:41,150
Do you ever wonder
if our work here will...

222

Will be the ruin
of all of this?

I just think it's

Don't fool yourself.

There are plenty
of people here.

We're entering
Cheyenne territory.

You do remember
our agreement?

229

You mean our agreement
to regarding

Ahem.

233
00:17:06,671 --> 00:17:11,715
I mean, our agreement
that you should go back

234
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,589
to Chicago once we entered
hostile Indian territory.

235
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,103
Yes, my dear, but it was
before you took ill.

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,718
Yeah.

237
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,349
I believe our
second agreement
supersedes our first.

sound like a lawyer.

mean nothing to me

here to share it.

freedom a year before

She convinced me
of the evils of slavery.

to kill her.

492
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:29,403
She hung herself?

493
00:40:30,573 --> 00:40:32,529
No, she didn't.

494
00:40:32,592 --> 00:40:36,100
The sergeant strangled
her and strung her up.

495
00:40:36,104 --> 00:40:38,007
Sergeant?

496
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:40,407
What sergeant?

497
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:43,705
Well,
he's out here, too.

498
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,589
I figured you were
saving him for last.

499
00:40:49,932 --> 00:40:53,361
Oh, you didn't
know about it?

500
00:40:53,433 --> 00:40:55,418
You tell me who he is.

501
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:57,436
Well, it hardly
matters now.

502
00:40:57,638 --> 00:40:59,089
No!

503
00:41:07,974 --> 00:41:09,400
Tell me his name.

504
00:41:09,443 --> 00:41:12,414
[Gasping]

505
00:41:12,605 --> 00:41:14,281
Tell me his name.

506
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,824
Is it a villain you want?

507
00:41:26,911 --> 00:41:28,952
I'll play the part.

508
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:36,059
After all,
what is a drama
without a villain?

509
00:41:36,298 --> 00:41:42,474
What is the building of this
grand road if not a drama?

510
00:41:44,327 --> 00:41:48,315
This business is not
for the weak of heart.

511
00:41:49,347 --> 00:41:52,295
It's a thorny,
brutal affair

512
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:57,469
that rewards the lion
for his ferocity.

513
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:00,317
What of the zebra?

514
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,739
What of the poor zebra?

515
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:06,975
Well, the zebra's eaten
as the zebra should be.

516
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,409
Make no mistake.
Blood will be spilled.

517
00:42:11,484 --> 00:42:13,497
Lives will be lost.

518
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,250
Fortunes will be made.

519
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:17,249
Men will be ruined.

520
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:21,840
There will be
betrayal and scandal.

521
00:42:21,893 --> 00:42:24,422
A perfidy
of epic proportions.

522
00:42:24,424 --> 00:42:31,678
But... the lion
shall prevail.

523
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:38,137
You see, the secret
I know is this...

524
00:42:38,191 --> 00:42:44,018
All of history
is driven by the lion.

525
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:49,535
We drag the poor zebra
kicking and braying.

526
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:57,054
Stain the earth
with his cheap blood.

527
00:42:57,127 --> 00:43:02,300
History doesn't
remember us fondly,

528
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:06,542
but then history is written
by the zebra for the zebra.

529
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,875
100 years hence...

530
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:17,211
When this railroad
spans the continent

531
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:22,692
and America rises
to be the greatest power
the world has seen...

532
00:43:22,738 --> 00:43:31,899
I will be remembered
as a caitiff...

533
00:43:31,946 --> 00:43:34,499
Malefactor...

534
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,835
Who only operated out of
greed for personal gain.

535
00:43:39,906 --> 00:43:43,925
All true. All true.

536
00:43:49,656 --> 00:43:51,627
But remember this...

537
00:43:53,774 --> 00:43:59,425
Without me...
And men like me,

538
00:43:59,468 --> 00:44:02,756
your glorious railroad
would never have been built.

539
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:05,281
