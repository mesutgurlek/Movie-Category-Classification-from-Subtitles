1
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,700
If you want any tickets,

2
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,400
you'll have to go round
to the front of...

3
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,100
Well, I suppose it'll be alright.

4
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,300
What the hell am I doing around here?

5
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,400
They walk in here and...

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's see. I hope I got...

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,100
Three?

8
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
That'll be seven dollars...

9
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,000
..and 50 cents.

10
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,600
Frank?

11
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,500
Frank sent us.

12
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,000
Did you bring a horse for me?

13
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,600
Well, looks like we're...

14
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,200
Looks like we're shy of one horse.

15
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
You brought two too many.

16
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Pa!

17
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,500
Look!

18
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,700
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.

19
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,700
Timmy.

20
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Maureen, look.

21
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,300
What you doing there?

22
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,400
Go inside, quick, and get washed.

23
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,000
And don't touch the apple pie
or the roast.

24
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,600
Patrick's already left
for the station.

25
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,400
He's getting ready, Pa.

26
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,800
- Damn it, Patrick!
- Coming, Pa.

27
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,600
Not bad, I'd say.

28
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,300
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?

29
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,800
But these are
the same slices as usual.

30
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,400
Yeah, sure.

31
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,100
As usual.

32
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,500
Maureen.

33
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,900
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices
as big as a door if you want to.

34
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
You'll have beautiful new clothes

35
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,200
and you won't have to work no more.

36
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,700
We're going to get rich, Pa?

37
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,100
Who knows?

38
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,300
Patrick!

39
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,400
Wait a minute!

40
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,000
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean 'em.

41
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,900
The train'll come in and there
won't be no one to meet your mother.

42
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Our mother died six years ago.

43
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,700
Go now, or you'll really be late.

44
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,900
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How will I recognise her?

45
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.

46
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,800
She's young and she's pretty
and she's a lady.

47
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,600
"For travelling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

48
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:30,300
and the same straw hat
that I was wearing when we met."

49
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,900
I'm gonna get
some fresh water from the well.

50
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Oh, Danny boy

51
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,400
The pipes, the pipes are calling

52
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,800
And down the mountain side

53
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,600
The summer's gone

54
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,100
And all the roses fall...

55
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,900
Maureen!

56
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,400
What are we gonna do with this one,
Frank?

57
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,000
Now that you've called me by name...

58
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,300
- I saw some fine stock down south.
- That so?

59
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,900
And the prices are good.

60
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,900
- These your valises, ma'am?
- Yes.

61
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
- Come, Sarah.
- Bring them other two.

62
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,100
We'll tote 'em for you, ma'am.

63
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,300
Is that true?
The sawmill needs hands?

64
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
- Was yesterday.
- Why didn't you tell your brother?

65
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,900
- Hiya, Gramps.
- Hiya, Bill. We're back again.

66
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,000
Come on. Get a move on, will you?

67
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,600
Get the lead out of your asses,
you redskin warriors.

68
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,000
I got a whole train to unload.

69
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Alright,
chuck down those feed sacks first.

70
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,700
Come on!

71
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,700
What's the name
of the place you wanted to go?

72
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,200
Sweetwater.

73
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,200
Brett McBain's farm.

74
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,500
McBain? Yeah, sure.

75
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,900
That stubborn redheaded lrishman,

76
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,500
tilling sand for years
out in the middle of nowhere.

77
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,700
Sweetwater! Only a loony like him

78
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,600
could call that stinking piece
of desert Sweetwater.

79
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,500
Sweetwater!

80
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,400
A little more to the right.

81
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,900
Higher.

82
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,500
Hold it there.

83
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.

84
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,300
They caught up with us again,
eh, Lafayette? Let's go!

85
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,100
Slow down.
What's the matter with you?

86
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,600
Watch out down there!

87
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Slow down!

88
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,700
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.

89
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,000
Don't the train stop?

90
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,100
What can I do for you, ma'am?

91
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,900
I would like some water,
if it's no trouble.

92
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,600
Water? That word is poison
around these parts

93
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,000
ever since the days
of the great flood.

94
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,900
- You mean you never wash?
- We sure do!

95
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I'd like to use the same facilities
you people do.

96
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,500
You sure can. Just happen
to have a full tub at the back.

97
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,700
You're lucky. Only three people
have used it this morning.

98
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,500
Used it one at a time
or all together?

99
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,900
I can tell
you're accustomed to fine living.

100
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,200
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

101
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,900
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!

102
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,900
- You've been there?
- No.

103
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,600
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

104
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,000
You know, she...

105
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,600
Jug.

106
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,200
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

107
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,800
Do you know
how to blow music from that?

108
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,800
Pick it up.

109
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,300
You!

110
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,900
You don't know how to play.

111
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,700
Try this one.

112
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
Take it.

113
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
Go on.

114
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,400
Here.

115
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,800
Bravo.

116
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,600
Cheyenne.
We thought we'd never make it.

117
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,700
It's alright. You're right on time.

118
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,400
To bury my escort.

119
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,700
If I'd waited for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

120
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,500
The gun.

121
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,600
You interested in fashions,
Harmonica?

122
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,900
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

123
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,400
[They were waiting for a train.]

124
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,300
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

125
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,100
So?

126
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,800
Inside the men,
there were three bullets.

127
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,300
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

128
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
For two reasons.

129
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,400
One, nobody around these parts

130
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,900
got the guts to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's man.

131
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,900
Two, Cheyenne's man
don't get killed.

132
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,500
That surprise you?

133
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,500
Yeah.

134
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,000
Well, you know music.

135
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,300
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

136
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
All the way up to six, if I have to.

137
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,600
And maybe faster than you.

138
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,100
Yeah, go on.

139
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
Play, Harmonica.

140
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,400
Play, so you can't bullshit.

141
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,400
Only, watch those false notes.

142
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,600
Like so?

143
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,800
This cousin of mine keeps writing me
to come down to New Orleans.

144
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,800
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."

145
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,800
I don't think
I'd get along in a big city.

146
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,500
It's too full
of fast men and loose women.

147
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,200
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

148
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet simple country life.

149
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,800
He's Timmy.

150
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,800
Yes.

151
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,900
Dear God.

152
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,100
On the day...

153
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,300
On the very day of your wedding.

154
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,400
Poor little miss.

155
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,100
Mrs.

156
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,200
Mrs McBain.

157
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,100
But we all... We thought...

158
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,400
I know.

159
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,500
It was to be a surprise today.

160
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,800
Brett McBain and I were married.

161
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,000
A month ago.

162
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,800
In New Orleans.

163
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,300
I am the resurrection and the life.

164
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,900
He who believeth in me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live.

165
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,100
Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die. Amen.

166
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,200
- Mr Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

167
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,700
I found this collar
on a nail by the door.

168
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,600
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

169
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,500
Cheyenne's hand.

170
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,500
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs McBain.

171
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,100
We'll make 'em tell us
before we hang 'em.

172
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,400
Let's get moving.

173
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,800
Come on.
Let's go back to Flagstone.

174
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,500
No, Sam.

175
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,000
You go back.

176
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,500
You don't want
to stay out here alone.

177
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,700
Why not?

178
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,800
This is my home.

179
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,900
You know, Wobbles,...

180
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,600
..I'm kinda mad at you.

181
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,300
Frank wasn't there.

182
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,000
He sent three friends.

183
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,900
I don't know nothing, I swear.

184
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,700
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

185
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,300
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

186
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,600
- I swear to you that l...
- Cos he was at the McBains'.

187
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,300
That's not true.
Cheyenne did that job.

188
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,000
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

189
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:01,900
That was always one
of Frank's tricks. Faking evidence.

190
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,000
I don't know. I swear.

191
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,400
Who's there?

192
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,900
Did you make coffee?

193
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,400
Make it.

194
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Didn't sleep a wink.

195
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,300
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

196
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,100
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

197
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:03,600
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

198
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,700
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

199
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:34,600
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

200
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,900
Idiots.

201
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,700
What the hell?

202
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,700
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

203
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,100
Be like killing a priest.

204
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,400
A Catholic priest, that is.

205
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:52,400
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

206
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:11,100
See, I ain't
the mean bastard people make out.

207
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:19,500
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me,...

208
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,600
..it fires me up.

209
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,300
And a fired-up Cheyenne...

210
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,000
..ain't a nice thing to see.

211
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,200
Especially for a lady.

212
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,500
But you're too smart to make him mad.

213
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:58,200
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing?

214
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,600
Yeah.

215
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,000
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

216
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:15,300
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me,...

217
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,700
..so they can hang this thing
around my neck,...

218
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,700
..I don't like it none.

219
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,600
But I can understand it.

220
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,900
What I don't understand is why.

221
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,100
Neither do l.

222
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,100
But I see you looked a lot
for the why.

223
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,800
Yeah.

224
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:01,300
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

225
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:05,800
Round. Yellow.

226
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,000
You know the kind.

227
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,100
You rap 'em on a stone,...

228
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,400
..and they go "ding".

229
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:15,600
Maybe.

230
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,400
But I didn't find them.

231
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,900
By the way,

232
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,800
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

233
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,400
He's somebody you'd remember.

234
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,000
Instead of talking, he plays.

235
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,400
And when he'd better play, he talks.

236
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,100
You know, when you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

237
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,600
Sure. You're an expert.

238
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,100
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

239
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,600
Of course I have.

240
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,500
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

241
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,000
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

242
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,800
And even call in your men.

243
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,700
Well, no woman ever died from that.

244
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:29,800
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

245
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,800
and I'll be exactly
what I was before.

246
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,300
With just another filthy memory.

247
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,700
You make good coffee, at least.

248
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,700
Not bad.

249
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,800
Congratulations.

250
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

251
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,900
I only told you to scare them.

252
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,900
People scare better
when they're dying.

253
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,800
And can you tell me
what good was your stupid massacre?

254
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,600
Now, a Mrs McBain has turned up.

255
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,800
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

256
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,200
Let's say
this is something I didn't plan on.

257
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,200
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

258
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:32,000
You know that.

259
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:36,100
I got on board
in sight of the Atlantic,

260
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:39,200
and before my eyes rot,

261
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:44,700
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

262
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,000
I know where you got on board.

263
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,500
I was there, too, remember.

264
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,400
To remove small obstacles
from the track, you said.

265
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:02,600
Well, there were a few.

266
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,000
But we travelled a long way,
just the same.

267
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,700
And fast.

268
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,400
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

269
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,900
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr Morton.

270
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:24,300
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

271
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,900
I watch that dry rot
rise a little more every day.

272
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:35,600
Any normal man'd
put a bullet in his brain.

273
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:39,700
But you,
you just got a little more hasty.

274
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,700
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

275
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,400
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

276
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:46,600
A lot.

277
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:51,200
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

278
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:56,300
Now, you're keeping
in the background.

279
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,200
You'll end up giving orders.

280
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,400
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

281
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,800
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

282
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,500
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

283
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:27,000
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

284
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,600
It's almost like holding a gun.

285
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,800
Only much more powerful.

286
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,500
You see, staying with you, l...

287
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:02,800
..I'm beginning to think big, too.

288
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,100
This McBain business...

289
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,500
..has given me ideas.

290
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,200
I'm sorry for you, Frank.

291
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,500
You're doing your best.

292
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,700
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

293
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:29,500
Why?

294
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:35,200
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

295
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,300
This is one of them.

296
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,900
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

297
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

298
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:51,600
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

299
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,600
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr Morton,

300
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,800
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

301
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,600
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

302
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:12,000
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you."

303
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,800
"From now on,
there are no more surprises."

304
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,300
And then you happen to meet
a man like this,

305
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,100
who looked like a good man.

306
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,800
Clear eyes, strong hands.

307
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,800
And he wants to marry you.

308
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,800
Which doesn't happen often.

309
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,800
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

310
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,100
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans."

311
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,300
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country."

312
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,900
"l wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all."

313
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,500
"Take care of a house. Do something.
What the hell?"

314
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,600
Well, God rest your soul,
Brett McBain.

315
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:07,600
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

316
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,900
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

317
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,200
If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

318
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,900
Mrs McBain goes back to civilisation.

319
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,600
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

320
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,800
You deserve better.

321
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,900
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

322
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:07,400
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

323
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,700
She was the biggest whore
in Alameida

324
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,800
and the finest woman that ever lived.

325
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:21,100
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month,...

326
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:24,900
..he must have been a happy man.

327
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,500
What do you want?

328
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,200
Cheyenne's right. Once you've killed
four, it's easy to make it five.

329
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,400
This isn't the time to leave.

330
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,700
Give me some water.

331
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,800
From the well.

332
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,300
I like my water fresh.

333
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:49,200
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

334
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,000
A sound? Like what?

335
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:54,900
Like that.

336
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,300
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

337
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:02,900
Morning, Mrs McBain.

338
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,500
[- What brings you to town?]
- Good morning.

339
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,900
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

340
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,100
I remember very well.

341
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,000
Is there something I can do for you?

342
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,800
Yes.

343
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:22,300
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

344
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:25,200
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

345
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,800
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

346
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,200
I got my own worries, and all I want
is to be left in peace.

347
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:35,700
Tell Frank I want to negotiate
with him. Personally.

348
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:43,000
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

349
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:46,800
Whatever business you have with
Frank, keep it far away from here.

350
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:50,500
I know, but when I heard that woman
say she knew everything,

351
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,700
I thought I should come over here
and tell you about it.

352
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,800
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

353
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:58,400
Sure, but you know
I'm mighty careful.

354
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,600
No one could have followed me.

355
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,400
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

356
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,800
To listen unseen
and to watch unheard.

357
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:10,300
You should learn
to live as if you didn't exist.

358
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,800
You've known me a long time, Frank.

359
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,800
You know you can trust me.

360
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,500
Wobbles.

361
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,800
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

362
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,500
The man
can't even trust his own pants.

363
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,500
Let's get out of here.

364
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,500
The end of the line.

365
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:32,100
Yeah.

366
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,200
Get him on board.

367
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,400
Tie him up.

368
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,400
Wait, Frank.

369
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,900
I didn't...

370
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,500
So, nobody followed you?

371
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,800
No. You gotta believe me.

372
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,800
So, this is the way I can trust you.

373
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,800
I can explain.
I didn't know that he...

374
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:46,400
- Get out.
- No, Frank.

375
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:48,800
Get out.

376
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,400
Frank, wait!

377
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:33,600
I told you to keep quiet.

378
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,200
Did Logan and Jim
take care of the woman?

379
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,200
Someone took care of them.

380
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,800
We found them out at McBain's place.

381
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Stone dead.
And the woman was gone.

382
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,600
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

383
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,000
First three, then two.

384
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,200
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

385
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:23,500
And you're the one
who doesn't keep 'em.

386
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,100
What do you want?

387
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,200
Who are you?

388
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,300
Dave Jenkins.

389
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,800
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

390
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:47,900
Calder Benson.

391
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,600
What's your name?
Benson's dead, too.

392
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,600
You ought to know better than anyone.

393
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:57,500
You killed 'em.

394
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:59,000
Who are you?

395
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,300
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!

396
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:04,500
The woman.

397
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:08,900
We're only losing time.

398
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,400
Alright. This time,
I'll take care of her personally.

399
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,900
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

400
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:28,100
Keep him warm for me.

401
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:30,700
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

402
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:35,200
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.

403
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,800
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

404
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,900
Keep an eye
on that cripple all the time.

405
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,500
Sure, Frank.

406
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,500
- See anyone?
- No.

407
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,300
There he is.

408
01:35:11,700 --> 01:35:14,200
You only know how to shoot?

409
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,300
Or do you know how to cut, too?

410
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:29,900
You.

411
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,300
Wait a minute.

412
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:36,300
Let's have a good look at you.

413
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,700
Mr Choo-Choo.

414
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:12,000
It's easy to find you. Bastard.

415
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:14,500
I don't have to kill you now.

416
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:17,000
You leave a slime behind you
like a snail.

417
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,900
Two beautiful shiny rails.

418
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,500
There's another bastard.

419
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:25,400
And he's getting further away
every minute.

420
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:41,100
There it is.
What your husband ordered from me.

421
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:44,600
And seeing as how he paid cash,
it all belongs to you.

422
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:47,400
Oak planks, beech, pine.

423
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,400
All first-grade lumber.

424
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:52,200
And there's beams
and foundation pylons.

425
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:56,700
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar,
and all these tools.

426
01:36:56,800 --> 01:36:58,800
Maybe he wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse.

427
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:01,200
Enlarge the farmhouse?

428
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:04,200
He could have built
at least eight of them.

429
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:06,100
By the way, ma'am,

430
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:10,000
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

431
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,800
Only it seems he forgot to tell
me what he wanted printed on it.

432
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,400
Station.

433
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,000
How's that again?

434
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,800
I said print "station".

435
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,100
Looking for this?

436
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:06,300
I've had enough
of your butcher tactics.

437
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:08,700
I know that woman is here.

438
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,600
I don't want
any more useless killing.

439
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:14,900
I'm ready to make a deal
for that land.

440
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,900
To pay what's necessary.

441
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,500
I don't want to waste any more time.

442
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:22,600
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

443
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:30,400
When you're not on that train, you
look like a turtle out of its shell.

444
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,900
Just funny.

445
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:37,200
Poor cripple talking big
so nobody'll know how scared you are.

446
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:39,000
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

447
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:44,600
I don't have time
to compete with you.

448
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:51,700
Compete?

449
01:38:54,900 --> 01:39:00,300
Why, you... You can't even
stand on your own feet by yourself.

450
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:12,900
Is that sufficient
to make you feel stronger?

451
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:17,000
I could squash you
like a wormy apple.

452
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:21,900
Sure, but you won't do it.

453
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,700
Because it's not to your advantage.

454
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Who knows how far you'd have gone
with two good legs.

455
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:45,800
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

456
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:50,500
Morton.
Don't worry about the land.

457
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,000
If you feel like paying for it,
you can pay.

458
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:56,800
It won't make any difference to you,
dealing with the new owner.

459
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,800
Cheyenne!

460
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:30,100
There's a square staked out here.
It says "water tank".

461
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:34,200
Over here, too.
Only, it says "post office".

462
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,200
And this one says "corral".

463
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,500
And this here "church".

464
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,700
What the hell is this?

465
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:43,000
Can't you see?

466
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:45,700
It's a station.

467
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:49,500
And all around it, a town.

468
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:54,200
Brett McBain's town.

469
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:59,100
Was he crazy!

470
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,800
Yeah, in a very special way.

471
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,100
An lrishman.

472
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,700
He knew that railroad coming through
Flagstone would continue on west.

473
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,700
So he looked over
all this country out here

474
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:18,300
until he found this hunk of desert.

475
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,400
Nobody wanted it.

476
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,600
But he bought it.

477
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:31,700
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

478
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:35,400
Waited for what?

479
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:39,500
For the railroad to reach this point.

480
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,400
But how could he be sure the railroad
would pass through his property?

481
01:41:46,500 --> 01:41:49,400
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

482
01:41:49,900 --> 01:41:55,200
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

483
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,600
Under this land.

484
01:41:57,700 --> 01:42:01,000
He was no fool, our dead friend.

485
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:05,600
He was going to sell this piece
of desert for its weight in gold.

486
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:08,800
You don't sell
the dream of a lifetime.

487
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:12,800
Brett McBain wanted his station.

488
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:17,300
He got the rights to build it.

489
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:21,800
- How do you know all this?
- I saw a document.

490
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:25,200
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.

491
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,700
One thing, though.

492
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:32,300
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

493
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,300
which says that McBain or his heirs
lose all rights

494
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:39,900
if, by the time
the railroad reaches this point,...

495
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:43,300
..the station ain't built yet.

496
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:53,200
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...

497
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,600
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

498
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,000
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

499
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,100
Yeah.

500
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,700
Yeah.

501
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:10,200
Listen.

502
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,400
Harmonica.

503
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,200
A town built around the railroad.

504
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,400
You could make a fortune.

505
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,400
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

506
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:26,600
More than that.

507
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:30,300
Thousands of thousands.

508
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:33,600
They call them millions.

509
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,500
Millions?

510
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,500
- Yeah, millions.
- Yeah.

511
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:46,500
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

512
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:54,500
What in the hell
are you standing around for?

513
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:56,800
Chief, what are we supposed to do?

514
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:59,200
What are you supposed to do?

515
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:01,700
Build a station, idiots!

516
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,800
I figure
it ain't gonna look like much.

517
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:14,300
But it'll be the first thing she sees
when she gets back.

518
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,100
If she gets back.

519
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,600
I think...

520
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:44,100
Yeah.

521
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:48,900
I'm beginning to think I might be
a little sorry killing you.

522
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,500
You like being alive.

523
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:09,300
You also like
to feel a man's hands all over you.

524
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,900
You like it.

525
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:20,300
Even if they're the hands of the man
who killed your husband.

526
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,600
What a...

527
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,200
What a little tramp.

528
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:53,100
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

529
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,500
Nothing, Frank.

530
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:23,600
Now I understand
why they miss you so much...

531
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:28,700
..down there in New Orleans.

532
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:33,600
Great invention, the telegraph.

533
01:47:37,100 --> 01:47:39,900
"Jill? The brunette?"

534
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:44,600
"The customers of the most elegant
whorehouse on Bourbon Street

535
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,500
have been weeping
ever since she left."

536
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,700
Say, tell me.

537
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,500
Did old McBain know?

538
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Yeah.

539
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:59,500
Yeah, I bet he did.

540
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,700
He was just the type
to marry a whore.

541
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:10,100
It's an idea.

542
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,100
I could marry you.

543
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:18,000
And the land would become mine.

544
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:20,100
And maybe...

545
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:24,600
..you'd make a perfect wife.

546
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:31,900
It would be me who wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

547
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:35,600
Too bad.

548
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,100
We'll have to think
of another solution.

549
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:40,700
Simpler.

550
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:47,200
Quicker.

551
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,100
As sheriff of this county,

552
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:13,600
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

553
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:18,100
of all property belonging to
Mrs Jill McBain, here present.

554
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:21,800
This parcel of land
measures 320 acres.

555
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,300
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

556
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,200
This property and all it contains,

557
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,300
Iock, stock and barrel,

558
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:34,900
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

559
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:37,500
All the contents therein
are listed by number

560
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,800
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

561
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:44,600
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

562
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:47,600
[Alright. That's clear to everybody.]

563
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,400
I declare the auction open.

564
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,400
Now, who's going to make
the first bid?

565
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,100
[A list of all the items.
Some of them are worth money.]

566
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,600
Alright. Now,
who's going to make the first bid?

567
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,800
$200.

568
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,500
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.

569
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:18,400
$200. Do I hear more?

570
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:22,500
That stinking piece of land
ain't worth it.

571
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:25,400
Come on, my friends, $200.

572
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:28,700
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

573
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,800
Well...

574
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,200
Who's going to bid $300?

575
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,900
Now, look, friends, I realise
we're not offering California here,

576
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:49,500
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

577
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:53,200
[Ladies and gentlemen, I wouldn't
even take 200 as a deposit.]

578
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,700
[Well, nobody's going to bid it up.]

579
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,500
You're sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

580
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,700
I wish I were wrong, Mrs McBain,

581
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,200
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

582
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
All I want is to sell.

583
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:38,900
- You're fat.
- If you say so.

584
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,100
- How many?
- One card.

585
01:52:42,300 --> 01:52:44,500
One for me.

586
01:52:46,700 --> 01:52:48,700
Dealer takes three.

587
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:02,100
Can I take a hand?

588
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:08,200
1 5.

589
01:53:20,700 --> 01:53:23,400
Yeah, sit down.

590
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,900
I'll deal.

591
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:45,300
How do you...

592
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:48,200
How do you play this game,
Mr Morton?

593
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,900
It's very simple.

594
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:58,300
As long as you use your head,
you never lose.

595
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,900
$500.

596
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:08,900
$500.

597
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,200
Do I hear any other bids?

598
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,900
I don't think so.

599
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:27,100
I'm sorry, Mrs McBain,

600
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:32,200
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

601
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:46,000
$500 once.

602
01:56:48,200 --> 01:56:50,900
$500 twice.

603
01:56:53,500 --> 01:56:55,700
- $500...
- $5,000.

604
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:25,200
- You said $5,000?
- It's on its way.

605
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:40,200
It's Cheyenne!

606
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:52,200
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that's right?

607
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:57,000
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

608
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:59,600
There were no dollars in them days.

609
01:58:01,700 --> 01:58:04,200
But sons of bitches, yeah.

610
01:58:18,500 --> 01:58:20,800
Wait a minute.

611
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,200
- The jail's that way.
- Yeah, I know.

612
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:29,900
Yeah, but you're going
to the railroad station.

613
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:33,200
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

614
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:35,400
They got a modern jail there.

615
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:40,300
It's got more walls, more bars,
more guards.

616
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:44,600
You'll like it, in 20 years.
You'll see.

617
01:59:55,500 --> 01:59:58,900
Two tickets, amigo,
to the next station.

618
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:00,800
One way only.

619
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:05,600
Here's to you. And congratulations.

620
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,200
You got yourself a good deal.

621
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:14,800
The auction.

622
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:19,000
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

623
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:25,900
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenceless widows.

624
02:00:27,600 --> 02:00:29,600
But then again,...

625
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:35,700
..I don't look
like a poor defenceless widow.

626
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:44,900
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.

627
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:47,900
And you're a remarkable man.

628
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,600
But you have something on your mind.

629
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:59,700
Have you got something
on your mind?

630
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,800
Hot water.
A bathtub full of hot water.

631
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:26,300
I think it's time
I filled that bathtub.

632
02:01:56,200 --> 02:01:58,200
Who are you?

633
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:20,500
Jim Cooper.

634
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:22,300
Chuck Youngblood.

635
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:24,700
More dead men.

636
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,800
They were all alive
until they met you, Frank.

637
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:40,300
You paid $5,000
for something that belongs to me.

638
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:47,000
5,000...

639
02:02:50,900 --> 02:02:53,200
..plus one.

640
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,300
You've got a right
to make a profit, too.

641
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,400
I wouldn't take too long
thinking about it, if I were you.

642
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
You got yourself
into something bigger than you.

643
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:07,100
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.

644
02:04:07,200 --> 02:04:10,200
You sound like a real businessman,
Frank.

645
02:04:10,300 --> 02:04:13,600
Being with Mr Morton's
done you a lot of good.

646
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:23,000
And you've learned
some new methods.

647
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:26,900
[Yeah, Mr Morton
has shown you a lot of new ways.]

648
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:34,400
Even though
you haven't given up the old ones.

649
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,100
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

650
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,800
Which deal, Frank?

651
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:46,900
We have more than one, you and me.

652
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:00,400
We can lump them together
into one bundle, settle all of them.

653
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,300
Here and now.

654
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:06,200
Easy, Frank.

655
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:07,400
Easy.

656
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:09,700
You gotta learn not to push things.

657
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:14,600
Taking it easy is the first thing
a businessman should do.

658
02:05:17,900 --> 02:05:21,600
I got an idea
Mr Morton can teach you a lot more.

659
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,700
How much?

660
02:05:28,600 --> 02:05:29,600
One dollar.

661
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,100
I'd swear we're going to have
that strange sound.

662
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:50,200
Right now.

663
02:12:01,500 --> 02:12:03,500
Time sure flies.

664
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:07,900
It's already past 12.

665
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:06,200
But they were his men.

666
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:08,800
- Yeah.
- And they tried to kill him.

667
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:11,100
They found somebody
who pays better.

668
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:14,900
And you! You saved his life.

669
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:19,200
I didn't let them kill him.
That's not the same thing.

670
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:33,900
Sure.

671
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,400
It's not the same thing.

672
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:44,300
You get dressed.

673
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:45,700
It's time to go home.

674
02:19:35,800 --> 02:19:37,400
Did you make coffee?

675
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
This time I did.

676
02:20:19,700 --> 02:20:21,900
Good.

677
02:20:23,700 --> 02:20:26,800
My mother
used to make coffee this way.

678
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:32,000
Hot, strong and good.

679
02:20:41,100 --> 02:20:42,800
Cheyenne.

680
02:20:43,800 --> 02:20:46,100
What's he waiting for out there?

681
02:20:48,600 --> 02:20:49,600
What's he doing?

682
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:57,900
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

683
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:03,500
I got a feeling
when he stops whittling,...

684
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:06,700
..something's gonna happen.

685
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,800
Surprised to see me here?

686
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:18,900
I knew you'd come.

687
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:43,800
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

688
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:47,100
Now I understand why.

689
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:53,200
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

690
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,800
So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

691
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:01,900
Just a man.

692
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:05,400
An ancient race.

693
02:23:10,900 --> 02:23:15,800
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

694
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:18,000
The future don't matter to us.

695
02:23:18,100 --> 02:23:19,700
Nothing matters now.

696
02:23:19,700 --> 02:23:23,000
Not the land,
not the money, not the woman.

697
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I came here to see you.

698
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:31,000
Cos I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

699
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:48,300
Only at the point of dying.

700
02:23:50,900 --> 02:23:53,100
I know.

701
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:37,700
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

702
02:24:38,500 --> 02:24:40,500
Put it there, please.

703
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:46,700
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

704
02:24:52,700 --> 02:24:54,000
You know what?

705
02:24:55,700 --> 02:24:59,600
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

706
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:10,800
You can't imagine

707
02:25:10,800 --> 02:25:14,600
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

708
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:18,500
Just to look at her.

709
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:25,200
And if one of them
should pat your behind,...

710
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:29,400
..just make believe it's nothing.

711
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:34,000
They earned it.

712
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,300
Keep your loving brother happy.

713
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:36,500
Who are you?

714
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,700
You're sort of a handsome man.

715
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:49,600
But I'm not the right man.

716
02:35:01,700 --> 02:35:03,600
And neither is he.

717
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Maybe not.

718
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,100
But it doesn't matter.

719
02:35:13,300 --> 02:35:16,100
You don't understand, Jill.

720
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:19,500
People like that
have something inside.

721
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:24,100
Something to do with death.

722
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:31,700
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

723
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:34,800
pick up his gear and say adis.

724
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:42,900
It would be nice
to see this town grow.

725
02:37:10,900 --> 02:37:12,200
Now I gotta go.

726
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:00,300
Gonna be a beautiful town,
Sweetwater.

727
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:07,100
I hope you'll come back someday.

728
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:25,400
Someday.

729
02:38:36,300 --> 02:38:40,000
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

730
02:39:04,200 --> 02:39:06,300
Make believe it's nothing.

731
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:03,600
Sorry, Harmonica.

732
02:41:03,500 --> 02:41:05,400
I gotta stay here.

733
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:43,300
Who?

734
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:48,800
I ran into Mr Choo-Choo.

735
02:41:49,700 --> 02:41:53,100
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

736
02:41:53,800 --> 02:41:55,700
He got scared.

737
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:15,200
Harmonica.

738
02:42:15,800 --> 02:42:17,900
When they do you in,

739
02:42:17,900 --> 02:42:20,800
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

740
02:42:35,600 --> 02:42:36,800
Go away.

741
02:42:39,100 --> 02:42:41,500
Go away.

742
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Go away.
I don't want you to see me die.
