00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,720
MAN: Hi, Ethan.
ETHAN: Hello, sir.

474
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,640
MAN: Hi, Marty.
MARTIN: How are you, sir?

475
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,640
MRS. JORGENSEN: Marty!

476
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,960
You got my letter about your son, Brad?

477
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,600
Yeah.

478
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,040
Just about this time a year ago.

479
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,840
Oh, Ethan, this country...

480
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,000
Marty?

481
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,200
Martin Pawley!

482
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,880
Him? Probably forgotten all about
you, can't even call your name to mind!

483
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,120
Her name is Laurie.

484
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,200
But I fairly forgot
just how pretty she was.

485
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,960
Ethan.

486
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,800
What about Debbie?

487
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,240
Hey, what are you doin' anyway?

488
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
Don't go taking that stuff!

489
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,960
Well, it ain't worth the mending.

490
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,920
What are you gettin' so red in the
face about? I got brothers, ain't I?

491
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah, well, I ain't one of them.

492
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,600
Look here, Martin Pawley, I'm a woman.

493
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,720
We women wash and mend your
dirty clothes all your lives.

494
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,640
When you're little, we even wash you!

495
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,800
How you can ever make out to be bashful
in front of a woman, I'll never know.

496
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,600
You talk like a fella just
might as well run around naked.

497
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,800
LAURIE: It wouldn't bother me none.

498
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,760
[Giggles] Sure wouldn't try it in
front of Pa, though, if I was you!

499
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,080
MARTIN: [Sings] "Oh, I got
a gal prettier than you"

500
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,480
[Martin yells, Laurie giggles]

501
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,280
ETHAN: We kept trackin' 'em till
the blizzards hit. Then we lost their trail.

502
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,600
Don't need to tell you where we went:
Fort Richardson, Wingate, Cobb...

503
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,600
Trouble is, we don't know which
band the war party belonged to.

504
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,840
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.

505
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,440
I got your boy killed.

506
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,360
Don't go blamin' yourself for that.

507
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,280
It's this country that killed my boy.
Yes, by golly, I tell you Ethan...

508
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,640
Now, Lars, it just so
happens we'd be Texicans.

509
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,120
A Texican is nothing but a
human man way out on a limb.

510
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,760
This year and next...

511
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,040
Maybe for a hundred more. But I
don't think it will be forever.

512
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,720
MRS. JORGENSEN: Some day this country's
gonna be a fine good place to be.

513
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,400
Maybe it needs our bones in the
ground before that time can come.

514
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,880
Bedtime.

515
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,680
She was a schoolteacher.

516
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,480
LAURIE: Ma, Marty's drawers is a sight.

517
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
Would it be all right if we
give him some of Brad's things?

518
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,160
Of course. They're in Grandma's chest.

519
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,600
Ethan, you're going to
sleep in the bunkhouse.

520
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,240
The letter! In the chest! It
came for you, Ethan, last winter.

521
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,280
Charlie McCorry brought it.

522
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,920
LARS: I'm looking for that letter,
Charlie MacCorry...

523
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,400
Here it is. By golly, I forgot.

524
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,920
Excuse me.

525
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,800
Mrs. Jorgensen.

526
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,640
Take a look at this.

527
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Just a snip of calico.

528
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,320
Ever see it before? Maybe
on a dress Debbie wore?

529
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,480
Yes, it was an apron.

530
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,200
Have they found her yet?

531
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,840
Not yet.

532
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,800
Not yet.

533
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,280
You might at least have
left me my britches!

534
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,720
It's time for bed anyway.
Here, try these on.

535
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,960
I ain't gonna.

536
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,560
Well, likely they'll
need some takin' in.

537
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,280
Marty, you're that gaunt.

538
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,960
Ma's having turkey for dinner tomorrow.

539
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,480
Laurie, come. Let the boys get to bed.

540
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,960
LAURIE: All right, Pa.

541
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,240
- Good night, Marty.
- Good night, Laurie.

542
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:45,360
- 'Night, Mr. Edwards.
- 'Night, Ms. Jorgensen.

543
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,560
Jorgensen's been runnin'
my cattle with his own.

544
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,080
Your cattle?

545
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,520
You mean Debbie's cattle.

546
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,280
He's agreed to take you on and split
the increase in my herd while I'm gone.

547
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,680
I'm pushin' on tomorrow.

548
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,280
Well, I sure ain't gonna stay here!

549
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,640
I started out lookin' for
Debbie, I intend to keep on.

550
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,440
Why?

551
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,800
Why? Well, because she is my...

552
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,440
She's your nothing! She's
no kin to you at all!

553
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,000
I always kind of thought she was.

554
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,760
The way her folks took
me in and raised me...

555
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,480
That don't make you no kin.

556
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,640
All right, maybe it don't. But I
intend to keep on lookin' anyway.

557
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,800
How?

558
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,240
You got any horses, or money to buy 'em?

559
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,720
You ain't even got money for cartridges.

560
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,760
ETHAN: Jorgensen's offerin'
you a good livin' here.

561
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,600
Martin, I want you to know...

562
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
I know what you want me to know!

563
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,320
I've got no kin, no money, no horses!

564
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,840
All I got here is a bunch of
dead-man's clothes to wear!

565
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,120
You told me that already,
so, shut your mouth!

566
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,880
Mornin', Laurie.

567
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,120
Mornin', Marty. Did you sleep well?

568
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,200
MARTIN: Well, no.

569
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,200
I kind of tossed and...

570
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,480
...turned and dreamed.

571
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,160
I'll get your coffee.

572
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,280
You know, Laurie, I...

573
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,280
...I was thinking maybe it's time
you and me started goin' steady, huh?

574
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,800
You and me have been goin' steady
since we was three years old.

575
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,000
- We have?
- About time you found out about it!

576
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,920
Gosh, Laurie, I've always
been fond of you, but...

577
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,760
...with all this trouble
with Debbie and Ethan, I...

578
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,520
Ethan rode on an hour ago.

579
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,080
I don't know what you can do
about findin' Debbie that he can't.

580
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,760
He'll find her now,
Martin. Honest he will!

581
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,240
That's what I'm afraid of,
Laurie, him finding her!

582
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,240
I've seen his eyes at
the very word "Comanche".

583
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,520
I've seen him take his knife and...

584
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,840
Never mind. He's a man
that can go crazy wild!

585
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,880
And I intend to be there to
stop him, in case he does.

586
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,880
I was hopin' I could hold you
here, but I guess I knew better.

587
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,520
I stole that for you.

588
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,280
"I... bought..."

589
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,000
Here, let me read it for you.

590
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,120
"I bought a small-sized
dress off of an Indian.

591
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,640
"If this here's a piece of your
child's dress, bring the reward.

592
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,320
"I know where they've gone.
Jerem Futterman".

593
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,960
Jerem Futterman!

594
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,040
He's got a small trading post
on the south fork of the Brazos.

595
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:06,640
Listen, I just gotta get me a horse!
Do you think your Pa...

596
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,000
- Finish your breakfast!
- I've got to find him!

597
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,800
- All right, go on and find him!
- Oh, Laurie, don't you understand?

598
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,080
[Crash]

599
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,600
But that's your own good horse!

600
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,520
You take him and welcome!

601
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,880
But don't you count on findin'
me here when you get back.

602
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,560
I've been hanging around
this Godforsaken place...

603
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,880
...for two long years waiting for you.

604
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,200
I ain't cut out to be no old maid!

605
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,240
I'm sorry, Laurie, but I just
gotta catch up with Ethan.

606
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,120
Well, go ahead and catch up with him!

607
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,120
[Hooves pounding]

608
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,760
ETHAN: Futterman?
JEREM: Yeah.

609
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,240
ETHAN: Let's talk.

610
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,200
ETHAN: You sent me a letter.

611
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:14,680
Yeah?

612
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,600
ETHAN: About a dress.

613
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,840
How'd you come by it?

614
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,000
- You said there was a $1,000 reward.
- That's what I said.

615
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,680
Got it with you?

616
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,000
You'll get the reward when I find
her, and if she's still alive.

617
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,160
A man's got a right to
expect some kind of payment.

618
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,080
I laid out for that dress
and sendin' you that writing.

619

[Clinking]

620
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,880
Twenty Yankee dollars.

621
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,960
A man's time is worth something.

622
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,000
ETHAN: Talk.

623
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,800
A young buck fetched
it in late last summer.

624
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,400
Said it belonged to a
captive child of Chief Scar.

625
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,480
Scar?

626
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,720

01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:05,080
I read it till the paper dried
up and the writin' faded out.

1103
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,680
It wasn't much of a letter, was it?

1104
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,960
No, it wasn't.

1105
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,720
Might've at least said you loved me.

1106
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:19,280
You might've asked me to wait for you.
At least that'd have been somethin'.

1107
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,880
But I always loved you!

1108
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,960
I thought you knew that
without me havin' to say it.

1109
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,080
It isn't fair, Martin Pawley!

1110
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:32,880
It isn't fair and you know it!

1111
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,680
- I wish you wouldn't cry, Laurie.
- Who's cryin'?

1112
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:47,800
MARTIN: I reckon the best thing
for me to do is to go away.

1113
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:52,560
You do, Martin Pawley,
and I'll just die!

1114
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:07,240
I'll thank you to unhand my fiancée.

1115
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,440
You don't mean you're
gonna be marryin' him?

1116
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,760
Charlie MacCorry?

1117
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:18,240
She sure is!

1118
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,200
And don't think your comin'
back is gonna change it either!

1119
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,200
Well, now, as to that, I
just don't know, Charlie.

1120
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,440
We hadn't gotten around
to talkin' about marriage.

1121
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,800
What right have you to talk
marriage to any decent woman?

1122
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,280
If you're referrin' to
that crazy murder charge...

1123
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:34,720
And other things.

1124
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:40,400
You think you're gettin' away with bein'
smart about the Indian wife you took.

1125
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,080
[Charlie laughs]

1126
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,840
I'll bet she ain't the
first squaw you ever...

1127
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:47,600
Why, you are a no good...

1128
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:49,480
[Crash]

1129
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,000
Oh, Marty, you've done it again!

1130
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,600
Get out of my way!

1131
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,640
Marty! Charlie! I ain't gonna
have no fightin' in my house.

1132
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:02,680
Well, then we're just gonna
fight outside, doggone it!

1133
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:04,360
I ain't totin' no firearms.

1134
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:06,880
Well, that sure ain't
gonna be no problem.

1135
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,240
- After you, Marty.
- After you, Charlie.

1136
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:13,440
LAURIE: Ma! Reverend! Pa!

1137
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,480
MARTIN: Look, here.

1138
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,040
CHARLIE: Thank you.

1139
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,080
Spit over that piece of firewood.

1140
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,000
[Crash]

1141
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,000
[High-pitched groan]

1142
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,680
CHARLIE: Quit that, Marty!
That ain't fair!

1143
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,960
Martin! Martin! Charlie!

1144
01:36:02,520 --> 01:36:04,240
LAURIE: Marty, now you stop that!

1145
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,120
SAM: Marty! Charlie!

1146
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,440
Sergeant MacCorry!

1147
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,440
Is this here altercation
in the line of duty?

1148
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:19,840
CHARLIE: No, sir. It's more in
the nature of a private fight.

1149
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,920
All right, then, go ahead. But
fight fair. No biting or gouging!

1150
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,520
SAM: And no kicking either!

1151
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,320
SAM: Get them up!
Make them fight fair!

1152
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:31,880
SAM: Now you fight fair, Martin!

1153
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,600
CHARLIE: Wait a minute!

1154
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,480
Somebody's fiddle.

1155
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,480
MARTIN: Hey, Seth!

1156
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,160
SAM: No choking! No gouging!

1157
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,080
Mr. Edwards, make 'em stop!

1158
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:46,680
Why? You started it.

1159
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,200
Marty, watch his feet!

1160
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,080
Oh, Ethan! No!

1161
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,600
ETHAN: Don't forget, you're a lady.

1162
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,880
SAM: Come on now, fight fair!

1163
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,400
[Men groaning]

1164
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,360
SAM: Come on, Charlie!
That's it, Charlie!

1165
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,480
[Men cheering]

1166
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,560
[Thud]

1167
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,560
SAM: Come on, Charlie. Get up!

1168
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:14,320
Are you all right?

1169
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,120
CHARLIE: I reckon so.

1170
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:20,880
Now, come on. I want you boys
to shake hands and make friends.

1171
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,280
Sorry I bit your ear, Marty.

1172
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,120
It don't hurt none, Charlie.

1173
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,000
Now you boys get cleaned up and
we'll proceed with the wedding.

1174
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:35,720
SAM: Where's my Bible?
CHARLIE: There ain't gonna be no wedding.

1175
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:46,440
Not till we get a few things
cleared up around here.

1176
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,400
SAM: It was a nice wedding party,
considering nobody got married.

1177
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,080
[Smack]

1178
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,360
SAM: Ethan, I gotta ask you and Martin
to take a ride with me...

1179
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:04,320
...down to the state capital.

1180
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,040
ETHAN: Is this an invite to
a necktie party, Reverend?

1181
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,280
No, I wouldn't say that.

1182
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,840
Likely you had your reasons
for killin' Futterman.

1183
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:16,360
Probably needed killin'.

1184
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,320
I'm talking to you now as
a ranger, not as a preacher.

1185
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,280
The fact that all three of
'em was shot in the back was...

1186
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:26,880
...the only thing that
raised some questions.

1187
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:28,840
That, and...

1188
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:32,800
...a missin' gold piece that
was known to have been on him...

1189
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,680
...just prior to his demise.

1190
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,160
Ethan, I'll have to
ask you for your gun.

1191
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,800
MARTIN: Well, if it's all
the same to you, Reverend...

1192
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,440
...I ain't goin' to Austin!

1193
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,120
CHARLIE: You're goin'
if the captain says so.

1194
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,520
SAM: Stop it! Stop it!

1195
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,960
SAM: I'll put both of you boys
in the smokehouse to cool off.

1196
01:39:07,480 --> 01:39:09,760
Good evening, ma'am. Captain Clayton?

1197
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,600
Excuse me, ma'am.

1198
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,840
- Captain Clayton, sir?
- No.

1199
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:19,240
SAM: I'm Captain Clayton.

1200
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:22,160
- You're Captain Clayton?
- Yes, I'm Captain Clayton.

1201
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,760
Col. Greenhill's compliments,
sir. The colonel wants to know...

1202
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:26,840
- Is your head cold?
- No, sir.

1203
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,440
I'm sorry, sir.

1204
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:33,920
- All right, start at the beginning.
- Col. Greenhill's compliments, sir.

1205
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,720
Hold on, son. Who is this Col.
Greenhill you're talking about?

1206
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:38,680
Why, Col. Greenhill
is Col. Greenhill, sir.

1207
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:40,560
- Commanding officer of the 15th...
- And who are you?

1208
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:42,280
I'm Lt. Greenhill, sir.

1209
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,440
What is it your pa wants to know?

1210
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:46,480
Well, go ahead.

1211
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,760
My pa wants to know... Col.
Greenhill wants to know...

1212
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:50,200
...how soon you can put a company...

1213
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:52,000
ETHAN: Turn around, sonny.

1214
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,720
ETHAN: Yeah, he's a Yankee cavalryman.

1215
01:39:56,440 --> 01:40:00,280
Col. Greenhill wants to know how
soon you could... I resent that, sir!

1216
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,760
ETHAN: Just funnin', son, just funnin'.

1217
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,560
How soon you could put a company
of your men in the field...

1218
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,640
...fully armed for joint-punitive
action against the Comanches?

1219
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:09,960
- Joint what?
- Joint-punitive action.

1220
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:14,160
We received information about a band
of Comanches under a chief named Scar.

1221
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,600
What information?

1222
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,760
That maybe he's not far from
here, holed up somewhere.

1223
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,600
What makes you think
he's not far from here?

1224
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,440
One of our patrollers picked up a man...

1225
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,760
...claims he was a prisoner
with Scar till two days ago.

1226
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:26,040
Talks kind of crazy,
but we brought him along.

1227
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,520
Says he lives here. Keeps
mentioning a rocking chair.

1228
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,000
Mose. Mose!

1229
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,400
ETHAN: Take his arms.

1230
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,040
MRS. JORGENSEN: It's Mose!

1231
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:44,200
Good evening, ma'am. I
came for my rocking chair.

1232
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,880
MRS. JORGENSEN: Bring him to the fire.
ETHAN: Watch him!

1233
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,080
[Thud]

1234
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:50,160
SAM: Get him up!

1235
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,840
ETHAN: Here, get him a chair.

1236
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,760
LARS: Charlie, bring him a drink!

1237
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,080
ETHAN: Watch his head!

1238
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:02,760
LARS: Take a drink, Mose.
MARTIN: Drink that down, Mose.

1239
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,280
ETHAN: Mose. Scar... where is he?

1240
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,160
My rocking chair. You
promised me my rocking chair.

1241
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:13,640
ETHAN: Where is Scar?

1242
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:16,440
Ask him about Debbie. Is
Debbie all right, Mose?

1243
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,360
[Chuckles] Made out I was crazy.

1244
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:26,040
MOSE: You don't think
I'm crazy, do you, ma'am?

1245
01:41:26,120 --> 01:41:28,280
No, Mose, you're just sick and hurt.

1246
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,680
MOSE: Thank you, ma'am.

1247
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,680
Mose, try and remember.
You were at Scar's camp.

1248
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,120
I ate dirt and chewed
grass. I fooled them.

1249
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:38,160
ETHAN: Where is Scar holed up?

1250
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,720
I won't tell you.

1251
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:43,240
I'll tell Marty.

1252
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:45,880
Seven Fingers, Marty. Seven fingers.
