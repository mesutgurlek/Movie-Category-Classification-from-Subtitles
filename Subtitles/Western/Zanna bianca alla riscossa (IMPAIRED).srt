Good night, Jack.

He needs to be in the cabin
so I can take care of him.

Congratulations.

You`ve got a healthy wolf

You`re right.
I shouldn`t have done that.

[ Footsteps ]

813
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,479
There`s something on the roof.

814
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,196
You must have been followed.

815

- I was careful, Alex. I did what you--
- [ Gunshots ]

816
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:34,675
White Fang, get under here.
Come on !

817
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,630
They stuffed the pipe !

Stay down !

819
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,795
Put this over your head.

820
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,195
It will help you breathe.

821
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,312
They can`t stay in there
much longer.

822
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,556
Hold your fire
`til they come out.

823
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,079
Maybe they`re dead.

That`s ''Coming `Round
The Mountain,'' ain`t it ?

826
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,998
I hate that song.

827
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,718
That`ll keep them guessing.

828
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,589
They ain`t takin` the hint.

829

Let`s move in.

Get in there, Tinker.

Well, earn your keep !

Free drinks on Alex Larson.

we`ve got to leave soon.

You know you can`t
take him with you.

847
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:20,229
He`d be miserable
in the city.

848
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,394
He has to run free.

849

That`s his magic.

850
