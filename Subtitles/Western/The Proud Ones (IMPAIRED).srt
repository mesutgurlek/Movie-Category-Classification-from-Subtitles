1
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,709
- Hiya, Cass.
- Hi.

2
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,870
Run 'em 600 miles.
How do they look?

3
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,676
<i>- A lot better than you do.
- Had 'em on the trail for two months...</i>

4
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,183
<i>and I only lost 10 cows-
What do you think of that?</i>

5
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,253
- Pretty good, Jed.
- Even better than that.

6
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,549
Skinned down
eight of'em.

7
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,683
If the rest of'em look anything
like this, you've got a deal.

8
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,592
Well, come on out this afternoon,
and I'll show 'em to you.

9
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:14,189
I'm holdin' 'em a few miles outside of town.
The feed's better there.

10
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:27,207
- Hello, George.
- See you this afternoon, Mr. McGuire.

11
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,338
Well, Cass Silver.
It's been a long time.

12
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,940
- Yeah.
- You marshal of this town too?

13
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,519
Got a nice herd here, George.

14
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,988
Well, thanks, Cass. Come on over
and meet some of the boys.

15
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:42,050
Hey, George, how about payin' us off?

16
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,728
Take it easy now. You'll get it.
You'll get your money.

17
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,769
<i>Now, you got two days in town
to buy a drink and see the ladies.</i>

18
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,997
Then we're headin'
back to Texas.

19
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,199
Oh, boys, this is Cass Silver.
He's the marshal here.

20
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,902
<i>- Dan, hand me down that strongbox.
- Just a minute, boys.</i>

21
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,104
I know you're anxious
to get into town and cut loose.

22
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,182
<i>Well, the people in town
are waitin'for ya.</i>

23
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,217
You're the first trail crew
to come in here.

24
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,343
And I don't want
any trouble...

25
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,047
so let's keep everything
nice and peaceful.

26
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:13,717
<i>As soon as anybody draws a gun,
I've got to go to work.</i>

27
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,088
I don't like hard work.
My ambition is...

28
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,132
to be the oldest living marshal
west of Kansas City.

29
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:26,667
If it was me,
I'd leave half my pay with George here.

30
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:30,106
No sense in blowing it all
and getting mad.

31
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,879
Another thing I'd do:

32
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,247
I'd leave my guns in my bedroll.

33
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,788
- See you in town, boys.
- So long, Marshal.

34
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,791
How about our money?

35
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,793
<i>There's a pretty
gal waitin'for me.</i>

36
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,503
This is a big day,
eh, Cass?

37
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,698
- What's all the lumber for?
- Boxes.

38
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,798
I'm goin' back
to my old profession.

39
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:39,639
- What was that?
- Undertakin'.

40
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,531
A lot of excitement.

41
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,230
There wasn't this much
when the soldiers come back.

42
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,705
They're here!
Thousands of'em!

43
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,141
Just outside of town!
They're just outside of town!

44
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,518
I told you we'll
need more room.

45
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,781
- Get some more chairs around here.
- Yes, Sally.

46
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,551
- Every chair means more money.
- Yes, Sally.

47
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,629
Come on. Let's get goin'. The faster
you feed 'em, the faster they're out.

48
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,858
- Yes, Sally.
- Right this way, gentlemen.

49
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,068
- How do you do?
- Howdy.

50
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,138
How do you do?

51
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,902
- What do ya got?
- Well, we have steak and roast.

52
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,707
Aw, you got
more than that.

53
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,146
Yeah. Potatoes.

54
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,719
Where have you been?
I told you I wanted you in early today.

55
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,588
<i>Don't be angry with me, Sally.
Look... what I found.</i>

56
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,128
- How about that?
- All right.

57
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,925
Now, get in there
and see if you can find a dishrag.

58
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,364
Used to be a nice,
quiet place.

59
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,705
That's the sound of money
you hear, Cass.

60
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,778
I like it noisy.

61
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,974
Marie, bring some food in.

62
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,583
I waited up for you last night, Cass.
What happened?

63
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,022
I wound up
in a poker game.

64
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,720
- Well, I hope you lost.
- As a matter of fact, I won.

65
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,558
Last hand of the game.

66
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,098
Two sugars, please.

67
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,534
You know, you remind me
of a cat I had one time.

68
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,573
He only came to me
when he wanted to be petted or fed.

69
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:53,134
- Pretty smart cat.
- Well, I got so I hated that cat.

70
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,738
Maybe this'll remind you
of a different kind of cat.

71
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,812
Cass!

72
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,822
Oh!

73
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:07,720
Cost me everything I won
and a month's salary besides.

74
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,057
Oh, Cass, it's beautiful!

75
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,463
- Is this a proposal?
- Could be.

76
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,466
Got a vacation due next month.
Winter's coming.

77
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,763
Oh, Cass!

78
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,838
Mmm!

79
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,910
Oh, Cass, it's too small!

80
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,139
- What?
- It's too small for my finger.

81
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,511
Oh, there's plenty
more where that came from.

82
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,107
We'll just get you
a bigger size.

83
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,655
Sally, the-

84
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,954
Oh, that's all right, Marie.
Just set it down.

85
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,733
Looks like the new owner's
moving into the Palace.

86
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,970
- Who'd Ed Bailey sell it to?
- I don't know.

87
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,605
- Recognize any of them?
- No.

88
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,515
No, they smell money, and they'll
go right across the earth to get it.

89
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,678
And some of them'll
wind up in the earth.

90
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:12,087
Well, the town's growing up.
More people means more money.

91
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,388
As far as I'm concerned,
more people means more trouble.

92
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,693
But this'll be like all booms-makin'
big noise for a while, then it'll quiet.

93
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,670
Howdy, Sally.
Hi, Cass.

94
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,798
How's Peggy, Jim?

95
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,173
- Oh, any day now.
- Mmm.

96
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,610
Dr. Barlow says she's
big enough to have twins.

97
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,614
Oh? Well, sit down.

98
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,947
- Have some coffee.
- I just had some. Thanks.

99
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:44,580
Have some more. You'll need some
practice keeping awake for those twins.

100
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,059
This town's gonna be loud enough
to keep us all awake for a while.

101
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:53,291
I was up at the Palace. That's a
big outfit, Cass, from Kansas City.

102
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,596
They brought their own liquor,
gambling tables, everything.

103
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,798
- Who's the boss?
- A fellow by the name of, uh, Barrett.

104
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:03,171
Calls himself
"HonestJohn."

105
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:09,713
Well, what's the difference?

106
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,045
If it wasn't Barrett,
it would've been some other tinhorn.

107
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:19,982
- Cass-
- What?

108
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,152
Don't forget my ring.

109
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,321
One size larger, huh?

110
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,303
<i>What's botherin' Cass?</i>

111
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,397
<i>Does he know this fellow Barrett?</i>

112
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,904
I wish he didn't.

113
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,301
Hey, Mike, over here!

114
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,600
Thought I asked you fellas
to leave those guns in your bedrolls.

115
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,607
Sorry, Marshal.
Just a habit, I guess.

116
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,201
Yeah, we'll try to remember next time.
Come on, boys.

117
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,611
Are you the Cass Silver
was marshal at Keystone?

118
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,776
Yeah, I was marshal
of Keystone.

119
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,581
I didn't expect to
run into you this soon.

120
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,656
My name's Thad Anderson.

121
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,023
Is that supposed
to mean something?

122
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,095
Don't it?

123
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,221
I believe you knew
my father back in Keystone-

124
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,799
John Anderson.

125
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,868
Remember?

126
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,205
Well, you should.

127
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,009
You killed him.

128
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,143
Yeah, I remember.

129
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,215
It was either him or me.

130
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,284
But it was him.

131
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,048
They say you shot him
when he was unarmed.

132
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,283
I don't know what you heard,
but you heard wrong.

133
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,395
I never shot an unarmed man
in my life.

134
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,026
That's why
I'm wearin' these.

135
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,140
Put it down
right over there.

136
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:27,046
Okay, set it right here.

137
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,122
Welcome, boys! Welcome!
First drink is on the house!

138
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,214
Got a blackjack game workin' over here.

139
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,816
<i>We'll have a roulette and card game
goin'on tonight.</i>

140
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:38,988
- Take a look at that sign.
- What are we supposed to do on Sunday?

141
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,396
Pray you got enough money left
to have whiskey on Monday.

142
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,468
Give me a whiskey.

143
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,003
It'll be all right there.

144
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,671
Howdy, Marshal.
Can I buy you a drink?

145
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,744
<i>No, thanks.</i>

146
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,141
- Pretty nice layout.
- A lot of confusion today...

147
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,480
but it'll straighten itself out
as we go along.

148
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:03,714
Could be a lot of money
in a setup like this.

149
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,452
Plenty of customers,
and new trail crews coming in all the time.

150
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,432
<i>Everything all right, Marshal?</i>

151
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,630
Yeah, it's all right.

152
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,540
- You're Cass Silver.
- That's right.

153
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,510
Barrett told me
you'd be around.

154
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,138
What else did he tell you?

155
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,376
He told me not
to talk too much.

156
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,113
Mind if I sit in?

157
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,183
It's an open game.

158
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,122
What are the stakes?

159
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,351
You name it.

160
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,428
Your ring against my ring.

161
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,826
If you move another muscle...

162
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,800
you might never
move one again, my friend.

163
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:40,045
Picture. Picture.

164
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,712
<i>Picture.</i>

165
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,017
<i>Picture.</i>

166
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,058
<i>Picture.</i>

167
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,128
<i>Picture.
Pay 'em all back.</i>

168
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:53,221
- How do ya like that?
- Back home we'd string you up for this.

169
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,698
- What are we waitin' for?
- I'll take care of this.

170
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,298
What happened over there, boys?

171
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,377
Thanks.

172
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,047
- Where is Barrett?
- Now, Marshal...

173
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,057
you're makin' a lot
outta nothin'.

174
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,821
You're not makin' enough of it.
That's why I wanna see Barrett.

175
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,590
Why bother the boss with
every little thing that comes up?

176
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,098
Come on. I'll buy you a drink.
I'll talk to the dealer.

177
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,566
- Tell him he's fired.
- Fired?

178
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,569
Dealers are kind of
hard to come by.

179
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,697
- He just got in from Kansas City.
- Send him back.

180
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:39,437
If he ain't outta here in 24 hours,
I'll slap him in jail.

181
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,981
That you'd better tell Barrett yourself.

182
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,050
He's back there.

183
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,186
What's the matter, Marshal?
You nervous about something?

184
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,753
Oh, yeah.
I heard some talk about you two.

185
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:08,671
- What kind of talk?
- They say he ran you outta town.

186
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:22,245
Stand back,
all of you!

187
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,530
Take him over
to Sally's place.

188
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,600
Get Doc Barlow.

189
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,938
Well, Cass,
can we put our hands down?

190
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,941
I'd like to buy
the house a drink.

191
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,787
All right, Barrett.

192
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,957
<i>I suppose you never
saw him before?</i>

193
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:09,262
Never. What was it about
this time, Cass?

194
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,735
Your blackjack dealer.
I want him outta town. Now.

195
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,035
- What happened?
- I don't like his jewelry.

196
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,247
Dillon.

197
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,117
- Did you put that dealer on?
- Yes.

198
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,247
- You know he was a crook?
- No.

199
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,349
A cheap crook!

200
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,360
I don't need that kind
around me, Dillon.

201
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,362
I built my reputation
on square dealing...

202
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,932
and I'm not gonna have it tarnished
by any fly-by-night blackjack dealer!

203
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,763
Do you understand?

204
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,268
I trust you. You're my right arm.
But if you can't pick better men...

205
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,866
to do the work around here, I'm gonna
have to pick a better man to do your job.

206
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,207
<i>Now, pay him off.</i>

207
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,408
- Sounds all right to me.
- Me too.

208
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:04,079
- Good show.
- You didn't like it?

209
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,283
I saw it before.
It was better in Keystone.

210
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,130
All right, Cass.
I took care of the dealer.

211
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:17,066
- Now, why don't you take care of yourself?
- I will.

212
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,194
It's no good, Cass,
the chip on your shoulder.

213
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,204
It's the same thing
all over again.

214
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,672
Why did you leave Keystone?

215
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,075
An old weakness of mine-
money.

216
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,579
Keystone was gettin' smaller,
and I was gettin' bigger.

217
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,649
That's why I left.

218
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,982
But I won't embarrass you
by askin' you the same question.

219
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,988
Here, let me get you somethin'
for that cut on your head.

220
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,990
Never mind.

221
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,992
I'll live.

222
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,062
I hope so.

223
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,757
I'll bet you a couple.

224
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,893
Hold the game, Billy.
No cheatin' now.

225
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,835
Leave my cards face down
like they was.

226
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,499
- What happened to you?
- Nothin', Jake.

227
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,667
Just upholding law and order.

228
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,075
It looks like you done
a bang-up job.

229
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:36,511
- What's Billy doin' here?
- He told me you locked him up last night.

230
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,708
I didn't lock him up.
I told him to sleep it off.

231
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,115
- Get him outta here.
- All right, Billy. Outside with ya.

232
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,245
Come on. Get! Get!

233
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:51,158
Cass, can you let me
have four bits?

234
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,891
- Thanks, Cass.
- Sit down.
Let me take a look at your head.

235
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,131
Eh, still bleedin' a little.

236
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:05,041
Eh, that's a lump
that is a lump.

237
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,339
A wet rag
will take her down.

238
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,740
Take it easy. That's my head.

239
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:16,548
Yeah, well, if it was mine, I wouldn't
be stickin' it where it don't belong.

240
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,254
I hear the Palace
opened up.

241
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,522
Well, there's nothing
wrong with your hearing.

242
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,529
Nothin' wrong with
my seein' either.

243
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,895
I seen John Barrett
this mornin'.

244
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,563
What is that stuff?

245
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,640
Liniment.

246
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,869
That's whiskey.

247
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,945
It is?

248
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,749
It is.

249
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,583
There you are.

250
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,589
Does it feel
any better today?

251
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,057
Yeah, but it's still
a little numb.

252
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,287
It'll be that way
a couple of days more.

253
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:00,695
As long as you've gotta stop a bullet,
that's as good a place as any to stop one.

254
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,063
You're young.
It'll heal fast.

255
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,626
- How long do you think it'll take?
- A week or so.

256
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:09,468
I generally mind
my own business, but...

257
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,873
how'd you get that?

258
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,241
<i>Not mindin' my own business.</i>

259
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,781
- Well, how's he today, Doc?
- He's gettin' along fine.

260
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,877
- Why shouldn't he, with you nursin' him?
- I'll take good care of him.

261
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,957
I'll be in tomorrow
to change that bandage. Bye, Sally.

262
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,425
Is there anything
I can do for you?

263
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,723
Would you mind
handing me my jacket?

264
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,434
Thanks.

265
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,734
Hey, how do I rate
all this attention anyways?

266
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,606
Fine food, fine room.
I never had it so good.

267
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,611
It was the marshal's idea,
not mine.

268
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,011
I'll have to remember
to thank him.

269
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,477
I'll get you some beef broth.
Doc thinks you oughta take some.

270
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,148
Anything you say.
I'll be the best patient you ever had.

271
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,921
- Is there anything else you'd like?
- Uh-

272
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,657
Yeah. Would you mind
fixing my pillows?

273
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,838
Ooh!

274
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,344
Let go! Let go!

275
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,109
That's a heck of a way
to take care of me.

276
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,948
Lookee here, cowboy.
You get one thing straight.

277
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:32,080
The only reason you're here
is because of Cass.

278
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,956
If he saw you trying to maul me, you might
wind up with a bullet in your other leg.

279
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,519
- That's the way it is, huh?
- Yes, that's the way it is.

280
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,702
How is he, Sally?

281
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,239
Well, you got
a bronc on your hands.

282
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,468
<i>When you're hungry
for food, just yell.</i>

283
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:56,138
<i>Okay, I will.!</i>

284
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,740
- She takin' good care of you?
- Oh, yeah.

285
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,944
Here's your money.
I picked it up from your boss.

286
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,181
Said your trail crew's
heading back for Texas.

287
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,587
Thought you oughta know.

288
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,785
Anything else
I oughta know?

289
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,794
Yeah.

290
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,594
I want you to know the truth
about what happened to your father.

291
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:21,739
You've heard a lot of stories about me.
I don't know what.

292
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,900
But I'm not trigger-happy,
and I never shot an unarmed man.

293
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,844
Yeah, yeah, I know. It was either you
or him, so let's just skip it.

294
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,074
My leg hurts.
Do you mind?

295
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,117
Thanks for what
you did anyway.

296
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:39,884
- Yeah.
- It's not much money.

297
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:44,087
I can give you enough to get back
when you're ready to go.

298
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,164
I'm not goin' back.

299
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,793
I figured I'd stick around a while,
maybe get me a job.

300
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,332
Take care of a little
unfinished business.

301
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,072
What kind of a job
were you after?

302
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,806
Somethin' that pays money.

303
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,815
You wanna work?
I could use an extra man...

304
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:09,148
if you want a job
as a relief jailer.

305
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,520
Look, Marshal,
I can take care of myself.

306
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,501
I don't doubt it.

307
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,136
Sally can take care
of herself too.

308
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,899
Jake!

309
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:12,270
- What is it, Cass?
- Headache, I guess.

310
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,277
What do ya expect?

311
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,246
<i>You're lucky to have a head left
to have a headache with.</i>

312
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,517
I need a drink.

313
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,587
You got any of
that liniment left?

314
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,982
No.

315
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:31,062
But you wait here,
and I'll go get this prescription refilled.

316
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,748
Cass.

317
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:45,893
What's the matter, Cass?
Don't you feel well?

318
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,700
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I feel fine.

319
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:56,270
Good night, Cass.
See you in the morning.

320
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,349
Good night, Jim.

321
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,138
Why, Sally, what's the matter?
Did you run out of rooms too?

322
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:28,144
What room is Mr. Barrett in?

323
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,146
Mr. Barrett's in 15.

324
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,216
Do you want me
to tell him you're here?

325
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,444
Don't bother.
He's expecting me.

326
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,284
Hello, Sally.

327
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:11,347
Come on in.

328
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:18,418
- It's been a long time.
- That's right.

329
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,328
You look fine, Sally.
You haven't changed a bit.

330
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,401
- May I offer you a drink?
- No, thanks.

331
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,732
It's too early for me.

332
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,329
I passed by your place the other day.
Looked very nice.

333
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,343
I might even
say respectable.

334
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,413
<i>It is respectable.</i>

335
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,481
Even so, you oughta do
all right in this town...

336
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,482
now that things
are looking up around here.

337
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,246
I was doin' all right before.

338
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,117
Why don't you sit down
and take that chip off your shoulder?

339
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,418
I wanna talk to you
about Cass.

340
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,060
Oh?

341
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:55,030
Don't shove him, Barrett.
He isn't in the mood.

342
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,727
Well, I didn't come here
looking for trouble, Sally.

343
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,202
He hasn't forgotten
what happened in Keystone.

344
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,240
He's been burning like a fuse ever since.

345
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,536
I can understand that.
A man runs out on a fight...

346
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,770
he can't just
forget it altogether.

347
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:10,575
You didn't run him out
of Keystone, Barrett, I did.

348
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:14,244
- You?
- I made him get out.

349
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:18,618
I knew you'd get him if he stayed,
and I couldn't stand that.

350
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:21,624
<i>I was the one who was scared.</i>

351
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,957
I just wanna be sure that you
get things straight. That's all.

352
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:29,397
I don't want you makin' any mistakes
thinkin' that he's a-scared of you.

353
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:33,369
So just take my advice.
Don't shove.

354
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:38,306
Thanks for telling me, Sally.
I'll try to be extra careful.

355
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:42,038
If he leaves me and my boys alone,
I'll do the same thing for him.

356
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:49,319
Keystone sure
missed ya, Sally.

357
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,787
The boys say the town's
never been the same.

358
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:57,624
Well, you tell the boys
that I'm flattered speechless.

359
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,302
Cass, I thought you was gonna hire
that Anderson boy.

360
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,347
I offered him a job.

361
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:20,008
I expect he'll be in to see me
as soon as he cools off.

362
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:23,679
It looks like he's cooled off enough,
but he ain't headin' this way.

363
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,567
<i>Thad.</i>

364
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,742
Glad to see ya
up and around.

365
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,869
- I'd like to talk to you.
- There's nothin' to say.

366
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,379
Maybe, but I'd
still like to say it.

367
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:52,540
How about hearing it now...

368
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,778
if your leg
doesn't hurt you too much?

369
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:15,038
- Sit down.
- Just say your piece.

370
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:18,302
What you gotta say
shouldn't take too long.

371
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,309
Then sit down and listen.

372
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,379
And don't interrupt.

373
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,417
You've heard all the lies.

374
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,357
Now you can hear the truth.

375
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,429
I shot your old man.
I admit it.

376
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,589
But I want you
to know how it happened.

377
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:44,065
One night, him and another jasper
came after me...

378
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,636
and I killed 'em.

379
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,504
Before I knew it,
the whole town was after my scalp...

380
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,702
callin' me trigger-happy
and everything else they could think of.

381
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,973
Barrett told everybody
they were unarmed-

382
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,482
that I planted the guns on 'em
after I shot them.

383
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,578
- Is that what they told you too?
- Yeah.

384
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:08,921
Well, here's one thing I bet
they never told ya.

385
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:13,396
Look, I don't get any pleasure
out of calling a dead man names...

386
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,956
but that saddle tramp
and your old man...

387
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,970
were the lowest scum
on the face of the earth-

388
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,472
paid gunslingers
for Barrett.

389
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,083
That's the truth.

390
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,283
You can do
what you like about it.

391
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,185
Are you finished?

392
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,800
Yeah, I'm finished.

393
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,096
- When did you two get in?
- This morning...

394
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,166
on the train
from Kansas City.

395
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,062
<i>Gracias, senor.
Muchas gracias.</i>

396
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,607
- Welcome. Pike.
- Afternoon, John.

397
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,944
- How are you, Chico?
- Ah, senorJuan.

398
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,542
Nice, John.
Even bigger than the one in Keystone.

399
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:18,520
You know, the chicken
without wine is no good.

400
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:22,115
- It sticks in the throat.
- I brought your favorite wine with me, Chico.

401
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,592
- The amontillado.
- Ohh!

402
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,562
You have a Spanish soul,
senorJuan.

403
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,699
- What's up?
- Nothing yet.

404
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:35,330
The reason I sent for ya-
I met an old friend of ours here.

405
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,001
Old friends are the best.
I drink to him.

406
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,078
Cass Silver.

407
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,848
Oh.

408
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,612
You know me, boys. I wanna mind
my own business like I always do.

409
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,914
I don't wanna
start anything.

410
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:54,753
But if he's looking for trouble,
I haven't got time to fool around.

411
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,054
This town's good
for only one season.

412
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,064
Do I have to say any more?

413
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,364
You won't have any trouble.

414
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,996
Go see Dillon.
He'll fix you up with a room.

415
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,838
I will take the wine. You know,
in my country there's an old saying.

416
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,402
Oh? What's that?

417
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,381
It means when the wine is drawn,
you have to finish it.

418
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,662
- What do you want?
- I wanna see Barrett.

419
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,739
He's not in, cowboy.

420
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,043
Hey!

421
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:51,873
Listen, cowpoke,
just who do you think you are?

422
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,952
It's all right, Jack.
He's in now. Go on.

423
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:03,860
- Well?
- Mr. Barrett, you wanna
hire a couple of guns?

424
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,725
I don't know what you're
talkin' about. I run a saloon.

425
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,523
You know what
I'm talkin' about.

426
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,535
I figured anybody
who'd run a place like this...

427
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:16,232
they could always use
an extra pair of guns.

428
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,240
Well, you figured wrong.

429
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,108
I don't hire gunslingers.
I don't have any need for 'em.

430
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:24,181
Oh, no?

431
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,584
Well, what were those two?

432
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,020
Friends. Just dropped in
for a minute.

433
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,987
All right, Barrett.
Let's cut it short, huh?

434
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,061
My name is Anderson.

435
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:45,593
My father was one
of your friends.

436
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,399
Oh, so you're
Johnny Anderson's boy.

437
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,406
He was a good man.
It's too bad-

438
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:53,602
You don't have to dress it up for me!
I know what he was!

439
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,111
He was one
of your gunslingers!

440
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,546
Well, wasn't he?

441
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:01,914
I see you've got your father's
quick temper too.

442
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,180
You don't come with
the best recommendations.

443
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:07,985
A temper, and the son
of a dead gunslinger.

444
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:11,289
No, you'd better stick to punchin' cows
like your father should've done.

445
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,694
He might've been alive now.

446
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:19,566
And next time, don't be so quick to stick
your nose in where it don't belong.

447
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,865
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm busy.

448
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,003
Would you pass
the potatoes, please?

449
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,068
Pass the potatoes, please.

450
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:00,871
Hey, you, wake up!
Pass the potatoes, please.

451
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,288
Thanks.

452
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,537
- Hello, Thad.
- I wanna talk to ya.

453
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,514
That job you mentioned-
How much does it pay?

454
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,814
SeeJake.
He'll tell ya all about it.

455
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,730
Things are sure
crowdin' up.

456
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,357
Tried to get a room in the hotel,
but they're all full up.

457
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,732
- Did you try Sally's place?
- Same thing there.

458
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,637
- I guess I'll have to pitch a tent.
- You've come to a busy town.

459
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:06,039
There you are, Marshal.

460
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,112
You know, I had my first funeral
the other day, thanks to you.

461
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:12,080
I wasn't used to it, but things
turned out pretty well considerin'.

462
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,914
If my undertakin' business picks up,
I'm gonna need to hire me an assistant here.

463
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,824
Oh, sorry, Cass.

464
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,799
- You wanna double your money?
- Well, sure.

465
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,872
Open a barbershop.

466
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,162
<i>Hyah.! Hyah.! Hyah.! Hyah.!</i>

467
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,636
<i>Welcome, boys! Step right inside!</i>

468
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,639
Drinks, excitement!

469
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,209
Poker, blackjack-

470
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,059
- Hi, Cass.
- Hi.

471
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:11,964
I come into town yesterday
with a herd of 2,000.

472
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,969
They're out in the pens
right now.

473
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,369
I'll take 35 dollars
a head for 'em.

474
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,442
Let's go out
and look 'em over.

475
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,010
I can sell all the beef
I can ship these days.

476
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,214
<i>Try it again.</i>

477
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,594
Everything all right,
Marshal?

478
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,272
Yeah, it's all right.

479
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,723
<i>- Hey, you got pretty lucky in there tonight.
- First time I ever won.</i>

480
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,201
Five hundred dollars.

481
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,898
- How about that?
- Yeah, pretty lucky.

482
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,874
Better go home
and sleep it off.

483
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,074
You're luckier
than you think.

484
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,060
- We weren't doing anything.
- Then why were you running?

485
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,261
You're gonna have a hard time
to get this thing to stick.

486
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,497
It's worth a try.

487
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:10,418
- Who are they?
- A couple of Barrett's boys.

488
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,081
Somebody won
too much money tonight.

489
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,890
Cass, what do you figure
on doing with those two fellas?

490
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,395
Turn 'em over
to the circuit judge.

491
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,465
He's due
in a couple weeks.

492
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:24,557
Maybe you oughta
take it easy with 'em, Cass?

493
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,068
It's just askin' for trouble.

494
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:29,435
You oughta go home
and get some sleep.

495
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,933
How are those twins doing?

496
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,171
Doc says anytime now.

497
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,086
Something on your mind?

498
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,801
lt'll keep.

499
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,832
- Good night, Cass.
- Good night, Jim.

500
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,672
- Good night, Thad.
- Good night, Jim.

501
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,910
- See you in the morning, Thad.
- Yeah.

502
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:22,023
Oh, uh, if I were you,
I'd sit facing the cell.

503
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:25,027
- Why?
- Might be safer.

504
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,265
Oh, yeah.

505
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,664
Yeah. Thanks.

506
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:36,638
And, uh, Cass,
thanks for the job too.

507
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,864
I figured
it was about time.

508
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,874
I'm a sensitive man,
senor.

509
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,501
I do not like to keep
people waiting.

510
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,809
If you're smart, Cass,
you'll let those two men go.

511
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,145
They were just drunk.

512
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,515
You got things
a little mixed up.

513
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,884
The man they were rolling
was drunk.

514
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,889
They're just a couple
of cheap crooks.

515
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,619
You gave us a lot of trouble
once before.

516
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:06,389
Now you're making the same mistake
all over again.

517
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,989
You got it wrong.
My mistake was leaving Keystone.

518
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,568
You had no choice, amigo.

519
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:16,230
You could have stayed,
but it would have been no good for you.

520
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,401
You know, pride can kill a man
faster than a bullet.

521
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,002
So can overconfidence,
Chico.

522
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:57,038
Still a pair of fours.

523
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,479
Possible straight.

524
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,551
I'll make it 10 more.

525
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,155
I'll see it.
What do you got?

526
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:10,488
- I got a... straight.
- You were cheatin'!

527
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,494
- I wasn't cheatin'! I wasn't cheatin'!
- I seen ya!

528
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,496
<i>- You did too cheat.!
- No, you didn't see me.!</i>

529
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,566
- Take it easy.
- I saw him cheatin'!

530
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,635
Take it easy!
Nobody was cheating.

531
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:21,670
- He was! He was cheatin', I tell ya!
- Keep your voice down.

532
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:26,607
Well, for you, I'll sell it for
just what it cost me- $289.

533
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,940
<i>It's the finest thing-</i>

534
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:31,344
Wrap it up.
I'll be back for it.

535
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,084
- Stay here, Jim.
- I'll be on your left, Cass.

536
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:48,097
All right, folks. Let me through here.
Come on. Let me through.

537
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,104
He's dead.

538
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,175
Take him out.

539
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:08,516
<i>- Through here. Make way.
- All right.</i>

540
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:11,019
- What happened?
- See for yourself what happened.

541
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,112
Fella wanted to
shoot up the place.

542
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,691
- Is that right?
- No, that ain't right.

543
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:19,353
Les was shot at the table.
He never even had a chance to draw.

544
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:21,658
- Who shot him?
- He did.

545
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:24,666
He killed him,
'cause Les caught his dealer cheatin'.

546
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:26,668
- Let's go, Dillon.
- What for?

547
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,967
- Murder.
- Just a minute, Marshal.
That's a pretty strong charge.

548
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:33,634
You know as well as I do, everybody
who loses money says we're cheatin'.

549
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,769
I tell you, Cass.
That fellow wanted to shoot up the place.

550
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,779
Dillon had to shoot him
in self-defense.

551
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,510
We'll let the judge
decide that.

552
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,586
- Let's go, Dillon.
- Now, listen, Marshal.

553
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:46,656
I'm not gonna say it again!
Now let's go.

554
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,523
You fellas come over.
I want you to sign some statements.

555
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:52,720
- What for?
- For the judge.

556
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,593
If he's guilty, he'll hang.
If not, he'll go free.

557
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,402
He'll hang.

558
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,099
<i>Jim, get their names
and addresses for now.</i>

559
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,175
Right, Cass.

560
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:43,509
Catch yourself a big one,
did ya, Cass?

561
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:45,513
- A lot bigger than he thinks.
- All right.

562
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,742
Inside with the rest
of the fish.

563
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,985
You don't think you're
gonna get away with this, do ya?

564
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,115
- Think you can keep me in here?
- No.

565
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:57,193
I think you'll hang,
Dillon.

566
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,466
What do you got to grin at, mister?
I think you'll hang too.

567
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:06,593
Wanna bet?

568
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:10,002
Anytime you want us, Marshal,
your deputy knows where to get us.

569
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:12,075
Thanks, boys.

570
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:19,410
Cass, I don't wanna
tell you your business...

571
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,416
but do you think you're
doing the right thing?

572
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,418
What do you mean, Jim?

573
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,320
Well, there's always
two sides to these stories.

574
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,723
They say Dillon shot him in cold blood,
but they were the man's friends.

575
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,557
Dillon says something else.
Maybe it was self-defense.

576
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:36,461
- How do we know?
- We don't. We did what we had to do.

577
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,693
The rest is up to the judge.

578
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:40,702
Well, I guess so.

579
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,704
But this ain't gonna
sit easy with Barrett.

580
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,570
No, I don't suppose it will.

581
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,870
Cass, I, uh-

582
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,412
I told Peggy I'd drop by
the house this afternoon.

583
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,709
- Do you mind?
- Go ahead. I'll-

584
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,046
I'll hold the fort.

585
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,780
See, the-
the closer it gets...

586
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,813
the more nervous she gets.

587
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,085
l- I guess that's the way
it is with the first, eh?

588
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:07,095
She'd better have that baby pretty soon,
or you'll be a nervous wreck yourself.

589
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,333
Go on.

590
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,463
- So long, Jake.
- So long, Jim.

591
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,404
Cass, I'll bet when you have
your first baby...

592
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,741
you'll be just as nervous
as he is.

593
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:32,343
All right, Billy. Get up. Get up.
You're disturbing the peace.

594
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:35,577
Cass, there's somebody in
the alley across the street layin' for ya...

595
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:38,210
and there's another one
on this side.

596
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,292
Get on home or I'll run ya in.

597
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:46,988
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

598
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,997
Here's your hat.

599
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,459
<i>What's goin'on down there?</i>

600
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,085
<i>What's all the shootin'about?</i>

601
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:43,001
Let me know when this
gets out of sight.

602
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,199
- Now.
- All right, the other side.

603
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:51,872
- Now.
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,848
All right. Look up.

605
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:58,409
When you get one of these spells,
how long does it last?

606
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,649
Three or four minutes maybe.

607
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,726
Why didn't you come see me
right away?

608
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:07,124
I didn't think
it was serious.

609
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,596
You were gonna wait
till somebody takes a shot at you?

610
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,507
Looks like pressure
on the optic nerve.

611
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,773
Might be a small hemorrhage.

612
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,904
These things are tricky.
Sometimes they get worse.

613
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,209
Sometimes they just
vanish altogether.

614
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:32,019
You can fix me up,
can't you?

615
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:35,649
Next time you get one of these attacks,
I want you to use cold packs.

616
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,887
Stay in bed
for a couple of days.

617
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:44,089
What happens from here in?

618
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,498
Oh, we'll have to
wait and see.

619
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:51,438
One thing for sure, any strain
or excitement won't do it any good.

620
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,999
You know, Cass, if I were you, I'd start
thinking about a different line of work.

621
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,076
You're not holding
anything back, are you?

622
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,377
Of course not.
I'm just trying to be sensible.

623
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:04,146
There are some jobs where
temporary loss of vision isn't important.

624
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,313
But yours?

625
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:09,256
Suppose somebody found out
about this situation you're in?

626
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,453
Your life wouldn't
be worth a nickel.

627
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:15,929
You know, if I were you,
I'd go to the best hospital in Kansas City.

628
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,330
Thanks for the advice, Doc.

629
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:23,934
Let's suppose nobody
finds out about it.

630
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,531
Not even Sally,
you understand?

631
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,442
You're not gonna take
my advice, is that it?

632
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:36,418
Taking advice
isn't like taking pills, Doc.

633
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:39,352
I guess they forgot to teach us
that in medical school.

634
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,186
But they did teach us not
to talk about our patients.

635
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:51,700
Thanks, Doc.

636
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,258
Cass...

637
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,028
I've been waitin' for ya.

638
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,757
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

639
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,265
Maybe I better
to tell you what I have to.

640
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,512
Cass, I'm quittin'.

641
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,778
I had a long talk with Peggy,
and she insists...

642
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:18,581
that with a baby comin',
I got no right to be taking chances.

643
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:20,588
It was different before
the railroad came. But now-

644
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,386
Sure. I understand.

645
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,859
How is Peggy?

646
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,193
The doc says tonight,
or tomorrow for sure.

647
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,469
I hate to walk out
on you right now, Cass-

648
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,199
A man's got to look out
for himself, Jim.

649
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,207
Don't say it like that, Cass.
If it was for me-

650
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:42,369
You got a right to come
and go as you please.

651
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,038
Nobody forced
that star on you.

652
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,512
I hate to do this, Cass.

653
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:54,146
Go home, Jim.

654
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,225
Give Peggy my best.

655
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,899
Don't look at me
like that, Cass.

656
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:14,841
It's my first kid.
It's all I can think of.

657
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,141
I wanna live to see it,
to feel it...

658
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,272
just to have a kid.

659
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:26,822
You understand,
don't ya?

660
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,982
Sure, I understand.

661
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:44,062
- Good-bye, Jake.
- So long, Jim.

662
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:02,251
- What's the matter? Your head hurt?
- Why?

663
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:05,521
Go easy on that stuff, Cass.
Take it from an old horse.

664
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:08,654
Too much of that liniment
will make you go blind.

665
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:24,306
Well, looks like the score
is still the same, doesn't it?

666
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:27,781
- Just about.
- Thad, I wanna talk to you.

667
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,484
I need a new deputy.

668
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:39,083
- What happened toJim?
- Here.

669
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,764
He got scared.
This job is rough.

670
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,766
And it's gettin' rougher.

671
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:49,099
It's a thankless job too.
Are you interested?

672
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:54,206
<i>- I don't know. How much does it pay?
- Hundred a month.</i>

673
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,838
If I were you,
I wouldn't take it.

674
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,074
Well, you're not the jailer.

675
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:05,350
- When do I start?
- Get one thing straight.

676
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:07,946
I'm not doin' you a favor.
This is no handout.

677
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:12,551
<i>- I can take care of myself.
- Takin' care of yourself is one thing.</i>

678
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,721
Takin' care of a town
is another.

679
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:18,400
If you wanna think it over,
now's the time.

680
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,408
Here.

681
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:32,212
- What makes this gun legal?
- It goes with the job.

682
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,412
Well, if you don't mind,
I'll use my own. I'm used to it.

683
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:39,852
All right. We'll go out tomorrow
and shoot some targets and...

684
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:41,856
get used to each other.

685
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,858
The main thing is,
keep your eyes and ears open.

686
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,224
There's lots to learn.

687
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,797
We'll make the rounds
together tonight.

688
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,633
Come on. There's something
I wanna show you now.

689
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,344
Just keepin' you sharp.

690
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,220
<i>Thanks again.</i>

691
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,297
- What for?
- For takin' the job.

692
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:26,833
You can always hire fools
or drunkards to do something...

693
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:29,871
but when trouble comes...

694
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,940
men are hard to find.

695
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,942
<i>Real men, I mean.</i>

696
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,947
- Well, maybe I'm the fool.
- Maybe.

697
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:40,948
Your first lesson
comes right now.

698
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,450
At night,
always walk in the shadows.

699
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,919
You can see better.

700
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:48,684
In the daytime,
walk away from the sun.

701
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:51,693
You'll live longer.

702
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,491
You know why
I need a deputy?

703
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:58,089
So's I got somebody
to watch my back.

704
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,394
If they ever get me,
it'll never be face-to-face.

705
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:07,168
<i>They'll have to ambush me.</i>

706
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:09,801
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?

707
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,586
That's Chico.

708
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,789
You wait here.

709
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,858
Ah, senor. A light?

710
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,629
I am without matches.

711
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:37,502
- Without guns too, Chico.
- Mmm.

712
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,303
That's HonestJuan's idea.

713
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:43,003
You know he has a strong
opposition to violence.

714
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:46,513
- Yes, I know.
- But not me.

715
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,684
Someday I will get you.
This I promise you.

716
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:53,721
- Someday I will kill you.
- Or some night maybe.

717
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,348
Ah, night or day.

718
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,359
That doesn't matter.

719
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,759
What matters is
the killing, no?

720
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:04,765
- Oh. You drink with me?
- No, thanks.

721
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:08,667
Ah, I drink the wine myself.
Good night.

722
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:25,220
What did you do that for?
He wasn't even armed!

723
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:28,415
- Thad, I wanna show you something.
- I've seen all I wanna see.

724
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:31,357
You're the trigger-happy killer
everybody says you are.

725
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,156
Or you're not tough,
you're just scared.

726
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,733
Thad!

727
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,439
Thad, wait a minute.

728
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,521
Thad, this is what
I wanted you to see-

729
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:40,595
this gun in his own hand.

730
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:44,826
<i>He wasn't drunk.
The whole thing was a cheap trick.</i>

731
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:47,698
Empty holsters
and a bottle of wine.

732
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:49,930
If I hadn't shot when I heard
the click of his hammer...

733
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,007
I wouldn't be here now.

734
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:16,294
What does he mean,
Chico wasn't drunk?

735
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,867
Everybody here knows he was so drunk,
I took his guns away from him...

736
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,868
and put 'em behind the bar.

737
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:24,599
- Isn't that right, Tim?
- Here they are. See for yourself.

738
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,505
I don't have to see anything.
I saw what happened.

739
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,535
He's trigger-happy,
all right...

740
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:32,944
but what are you
gonna do about it?

741
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,017
He's got legal guns.

742
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,618
I got legal guns too.

743
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,300
Why don't you light someplace
and get off that leg?

744
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,370
My leg's all right.

745
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:03,105
If it's Cass you're lookin' for, he's comin'
down the other side of the street.

746
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,596
- Morning, Jake.
- Good morning, Cass.

747
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,967
What are you doing here?

748
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:32,597
About last night,
Cass. Uh-

749
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:35,871
I was wrong,
and I wanted to tell you about it.

750
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:38,446
- Yeah?
- Well, when you shot Chico...

751
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,947
the only thing I could
think of was that...

752
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,746
this is the way
my old man got it.

753
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:46,947
l- I didn't know Chico was armed.
He really had me fooled.

754
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:51,892
How do you feel
about it now?

755
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:56,021
l- I made a fool of myself,
and I'm sorry.

756
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,532
- Here. Do you want your badge back?
- Keep it.

757
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:02,730
We got a date to do some
practice shooting, don't we?

758
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,806
Yeah.

759
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:25,026
Come on. Let's go.

760
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:54,455
Your way ain't workin'.

761
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,583
- He's not scarin'.
- Give him time.

762
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,685
Now, wait a minute.
I'm not gonna end up like Chico.

763
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:03,162
You better let me
get him my way.

764
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:05,165
Take it easy, Pike.

765
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:08,293
I think we're gonna have
a new marshal very soon.

766
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:33,358
When this rock hits the ground,
we both draw.

767
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:35,726
You ready?

768
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,706
Try it again.
When you go for your gun...

769
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:49,209
draw and shoot
over your holster.

770
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:52,371
Don't stick your hand out.
You'll lose time.

771
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,449
Right?

772
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,191
You throw the rock
this time.

773
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,649
Let her go.

774
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,596
That was better.

775
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,141
Put up your gun.
Let's go.

776
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,432
You ready?

777
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,806
That's the way!

778
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,942
Let's try it again.

779
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:45,252
Now let's see how fast
you can draw.

780
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:04,271
You better count your shots
after this.

781
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,216
That gun's empty.

782
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:13,282
When you draw on a man,
don't let him talk to you, shoot him.

783
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:19,989
Still not sure I was telling the truth
about your father, are ya?

784
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:23,531
- No.
- You never will be.

785
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:26,499
It's my word
against everybody else's.

786
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:29,537
But I wish you'd believe me.

787
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:37,679
I don't know
what to believe.

788
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,441
Come on back to town
and have a drink.

789
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:44,912
You look like
you could use one.

790
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:36,470
- Tim?
- Yeah?

791
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:41,368
Go tell Markham I'd
like to talk to the council.

792
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:44,139
Right.

793
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:04,298
Cass, I know you're not gonna like what
I got to say, but I think it needs sayin'.

794
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:09,393
Now, it's no secret that you and Mr. Barrett
here don't get along together.

795
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,440
You and him had
some personal trouble.

796
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:16,136
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

797
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:19,612
Well, that might explain
why you're ridin' him so hard.

798
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:22,149
Pickin' gunfights with his men,
runnin' 'em in jail.

799
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:26,278
<i>And why you got him so whittled down,
he can't hardly operate.</i>

800
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,657
That's what I had in mind.

801
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:34,695
Cass, you've been lookin'
for trouble.

802
01:15:34,796 --> 01:15:39,358
Do you realize that we've had more
killin' and bloodshed in the past month...

803
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:41,527
than this town
ever saw before?

804
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:44,697
This town never saw
Barrett before.

805
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:48,367
I told ya I was gonna crack down
if he didn't operate on the level.

806
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:51,469
Well, that's what I've been doing,
and I intend to keep on doing it.

807
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,812
Well, there you are, gentlemen.
Nothing a bit plainer than that.

808
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:59,183
We ain't blamin' ya, Cass.
It's human nature.

809
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:02,121
You're tryin' to get even
with this man.

810
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,990
But you've got a license to kill,
and you've been abusin' it.

811
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:09,894
And this man Chico
that you killed last night...

812
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,432
we can't have that, Cass.

813
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,502
We just can't have it.
That's all.

814
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:16,571
Are you trying to fire me?

815
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,640
We don't wanna do that, Cass.

816
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:22,733
We-We got too much
respect for ya.

817
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:28,009
But under the circumstances,
we're asking for your resignation.

818
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:44,724
Sorry, gentlemen.
I'm not going to sign it.

819
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,994
<i>Not today.</i>

820
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:51,869
Just got a telegram from Judge Creedy.
He'll be in town tomorrow.

821
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:55,933
I've got one man up for murder and two
for assault with a deadly weapon.

822
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:58,706
I'm gonna deliver my prisoners
for trial.

823
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:03,410
<i>- Then I'll resign.
- Well, that's fair enough.</i>

824
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:06,612
- Anybody got any objections?
- No.

825
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:10,548
I don't know if you want
a good man for this job or not...

826
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:13,389
but if you do,
I'd like to suggest my deputy.

827
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:16,157
<i>He's young,
and you won't find a better man.</i>

828
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:18,630
<i>Well, we'll vote on that tomorrow.</i>

829
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:22,033
Now, anybody else
got anything to say?

830
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:25,072
Well, there's one thing
I'd like to say, Cass.

831
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:29,109
I, uh, hope you don't take this
as a personal reflection on you.

832
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:32,305
No, Sam, I don't.

833
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:34,814
I take it as
a personal reflection on you.

834
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,941
<i>All of you.</i>

835
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:39,111
The minute you people
smelled money...

836
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:41,781
this town got an attack
of larceny.

837
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,120
I don't blame that on Barrett.
I blame it on you!

838
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:47,787
You're supposed to be respectable.
You talk about law and order.

839
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:51,388
You'd sell out for a copper penny.
Any one of you!

840
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:53,934
You're robbin' and stealin'
just the same as he is...

841
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:57,494
with your $50 boots
and your $12 hotel rooms.

842
01:17:57,606 --> 01:18:03,135
If I was on this council, I couldn't look
in the mirror without vomiting!

843
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:07,409
Cass, here's your ring.

844
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,229
Thanks for what
you said in there.

845
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,798
I meant every word of it.

846
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:31,631
- Mr. Barrett.
- Mr. Barrett.

847
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:40,381
Your way, Pike.

848
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:20,786
You crazy fool!
What's the matter with you?

849
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:23,380
Have you gone out of
your mind?

850
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:26,188
- Doc Barlow told you.
- Yes, he told me.

851
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:29,525
Why didn't you?
The chips are down now, Cass.

852
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:33,260
It was bad enough before, but now-
Oh, Cass, there's gonna be trouble...

853
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:35,859
and you're in no condition
to do anything about it.

854
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:39,031
- I'm all right, Sally.
- All right?

855
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:42,440
<i>You call going blind
all right?</i>

856
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:46,310
Do you think I'm gonna sit back
and watch you dig your own grave?

857
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:49,110
- We're getting out of here tonight.
- Sally, listen to me.

858
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:51,777
No! You listen to me.

859
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:55,356
You're trying to be noble,
is that it?

860
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:59,621
Do you think that Barrett is gonna
let you turn his men over to a judge?

861
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:04,494
- I've gotta stay, Sally.
- Stay?

862
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:06,567
Stay for what?

863
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:09,637
For whom?
Nobody wants you.

864
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:12,206
Doc Barlow told me that the council
asked you to quit...

865
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,741
so what have you got
to stay for?

866
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:17,573
You don't owe them
anything, Cass.

867
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:24,884
There's a train leaving
for Kansas City tonight.

868
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:29,116
- We're taking it.
- Tomorrow. Not tonight.

869
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:32,523
Cass, we've got to get out
of this town right away.

870
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:34,527
Tonight!

871
01:20:34,629 --> 01:20:36,597
We're gonna do
what Doc Barlow says-

872
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:38,859
go to Kansas City
and find a good doctor.

873
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:41,231
- We'll talk about it in the morning.
- I wanna talk about it now.

874
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:43,770
- But, Sally, I'm not a coward.
- Coward?

875
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:47,467
This is suicide!

876
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:50,670
What are you gonna do, stay here
and let your crazy pride kill you?

877
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,679
This time I'm staying.

878
01:20:52,781 --> 01:20:55,909
Oh, Cass,
I'm only thinking of you.

879
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:58,212
- I want you alive.
- Sally...

880
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:02,289
a man can't live a lifetime
being ashamed.

881
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:05,188
Some things you never forget.

882
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:07,989
You make a decision in five minutes,
and you spend the rest of your life...

883
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,564
wishing you could do
those five minutes again.

884
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,997
Oh, Cass,
that's all past.

885
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:15,001
Everybody does things
they'd like to do over.

886
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:19,005
Maybe I'm lucky.
Everybody doesn't get a second chance.

887
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:21,371
Please, Cass. Please!

888
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,648
Whatever it is,
don't go!

889
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:29,876
Don't go, Cass!

890
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:41,424
- What is it, Thad?
- Jailbreak!

891
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:45,800
Tim the bartender.

892
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,346
Jake.

893
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,965
Who did this, Cass?

894
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,968
I don't know.

895
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:57,231
Only that Barrett
will need a new bartender.

896
01:22:57,339 --> 01:22:59,569
He's lying dead out there.

897
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:15,251
- Cass!
- You'd better clear the streets...

898
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:18,349
'cause there'll be more killing,
and you won't like that.

899
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:25,192
Cass, Dillon and three men
were headed for Simpson's barn.

900
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:00,859
Keep your eyes open
while I cross.

901
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:04,970
When I get to the other side,
I'll watch you.

902
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,630
There's someone
in that loft.

903
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:42,276
We have to run for it.

904
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:45,211
Head for that stagecoach.

905
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:04,324
- They're headed this way.
- All right. Get ready.

906
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,206
Here they come.

907
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:17,368
Hold it, Pike.
Wait till they get in the barn.

908
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,075
<i>Those open doors are a trap.</i>

909
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,976
We'll go around
to the far side.

910
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,871
It's old man Simpson's barn.

911
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,207
There's stalls to the right
and left of those doors.

912
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:54,440
You go in the left.
I'll go in the right.

913
01:26:04,659 --> 01:26:08,186
When we kick in those doors,
blast away.

914
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:53,033
It's me, Cass.

915
01:27:57,572 --> 01:27:59,836
What is it, Cass?
What's the matter?

916
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,069
I can't see.
I can't see anything.

917
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:06,908
Go out that window,
go down below and get by the slit.

918
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:09,506
- We'll get 'em in a cross fire.
- Right.

919
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:12,844
All right.
Get your gun up here.

920
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:16,685
- You keep firing till I get across.
- Get outta here while you can.

921
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:23,192
I like it here.

922
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,062
Besides,
I got no place to go.

923
01:30:40,868 --> 01:30:43,735
Get him over to Doc Barlow's,
Sally, right away.

924
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:45,738
Where are you going, Thad?

925
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,933
To finish the job.

926
01:31:04,091 --> 01:31:06,059
Go after him, Sally.

927
01:31:19,874 --> 01:31:22,434
- I'm here if you need me, Thad.
- Thanks, Jim.

928
01:31:43,364 --> 01:31:46,492
Well, can I buy ya
a drink, Marshal?

929
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:49,934
- I'm arresting you, Barrett.
- Is this official?

930
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:53,665
<i>All right. Let's go, Barrett.</i>

931
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:56,800
Well, do you mind telling me why
you're arresting me?

932
01:31:58,579 --> 01:32:00,547
For murder.

933
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:05,151
I think we both need a drink.

934
01:32:59,407 --> 01:33:03,673
After we see Doc Barlow,
we're headin' for Kansas City.

935
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,378
All right, honey,
but take it easy.

936
01:33:08,482 --> 01:33:10,780
We're not running away
from anything.
