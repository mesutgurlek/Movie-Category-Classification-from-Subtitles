00:03:56,367 --> 00:04:02,434
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. TULEEN.

21
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:11,968
NETTIE, YOU NEED
TO BE CAREFUL.

22
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,834
I'LL GET 'EM.

23
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:19,968
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
CARE OF THESE BOOKS.

24
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,968
DO YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT ME, BILLY RAY?

25
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,701
OF COURSE I DO.

26
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,934
I USUALLY WONDER IF

27
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,868
YOU'RE DOING YOUR
HOMEWORK RIGHT.

28
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:34,534
NO, I MEAN

29
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:38,400
DO YOU EVER THINK
OF ME AS A WOMAN?

30
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:41,968
SOMEDAY, YOU'RE GONNA BE
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

31
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:44,634
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU DON'T?

32
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,767
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

33
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,734
WHEN YOU'RE A LITTLE GIRL,
ALL YOU WANT IS TO BE A WOMAN.

34
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:51,601
WHEN YOU'RE A WOMAN,
YOU REALIZE

35
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,767
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
TO BE A LITTLE GIRL.

36
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:55,100
IT'S DIFFERENT
FOR A MAN.

37
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,467
WHEN HE'S A BOY

38
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:59,167
HE NEEDS TO BEHAVE
AND MIND HIS FOLKS.

39
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:01,667
BUT WHEN
HE'S A MAN

40
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,400
HE HAS TO STAND TALL,
SPEAK THE TRUTH

41
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,300
MAKE AN HONEST
DAY'S LIVING

42
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:08,334
AND BE ABLE TO LOOK
ANY OTHER MAN

43
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,767
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE
WITHOUT FLINCHING.

44
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,934

GOOD MORNIN', BILLY RAY.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,367

THINK ABOUT THIS
FOR A MINUTE, LON.

51
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,734
LET'S SAY YOU HAD
SEVEN CHICKENS

52
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:50,734
AND YOUR NEIGHBOR
CAME OVER

53
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,534
AND TOOK AWAY
THREE OF THEM.

54
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:58,701
HOW MANY WOULD
YOU HAVE LEFT?

55
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,701
WELL, I'D HAVE
SEVEN 'CAUSE

00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,267
I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH
ARITHMETIC FOR TODAY.

60
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:18,033

SIT DOWN?

00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,834
LOOKS LIKE ONE RIDER, HUH?

163
00:13:56,901 --> 00:14:00,767
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYBODY ON THEM HORSES.

164
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:09,367
I SEE THE SHERIFF.
I SWEAR THAT'S HIM.

165
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:15,534
WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

166
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:21,601
( man )
SHERIFF, YOU
DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

167
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,367
SOMEBODY GET THE DOC.

168
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:27,601
THAT'S JETHRO'S HORSE!
WHERE IS JETHRO?

169
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,300
THERE'S BLOOD
ON THE SADDLE.

170
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:34,100
WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED, SHERIFF?

171
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:40,234
LORDY, THEY'VE CUT
OUT HIS TONGUE.

172
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,901
EXCUSE ME, DEPUTY.

173
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:49,901
DID YOU SAY THAT THEY
CUT OUT HIS TONGUE?

174
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:54,634
( man )
HERE IT IS, RIGHT HERE.

175
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,434
( Deputy Sheriff)
EVEN IF WE COULD
GET A POSSE TOGETHER,

176
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:58,234
WE WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO FIND 'EM.

177
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,868
U.S. GOVERNMENT
AND THE FEDERALES

178
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,467
BEEN SEARCHIN'
FOR HIM FOR YEARS.

179
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:05,000
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHIN'
ABOUT THIS " <i>EL DIABLO</i> ."

180
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,400
THEY DID FIND HIM ONCE.

181
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,067
CAUGHT HIM
DOWN IN AMOS,

182
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:11,234
THAT LITTLE BORDER TOWN
NORTH OF LAREDO.

183
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,100
CAUGHT HIM,
TRIED HIM

184
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:15,601
AND HANGED HIM,
ALL IN THE SAME NIGHT.

185
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,734
BUT HE WOULDN'T DIE.

186
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:20,200
HE JUST HANGED THERE
BY HIS NECK, SPITTIN'

187
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:23,534
AT THE CROWD LIKE
THEY DISGUSTED HIM.

188
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:24,868
CUSSED 'EM OUT SO BAD,

189
00:15:24,934 --> 00:15:26,868
THE WOMENFOLK
HAD TO GO HOME.

190
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:29,501
I WAS THERE WHEN
THEY CUT HIM DOWN.

191
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:33,100
I THANK THE LORD
I LEFT WHEN I DID.

192
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,834
IT WAS THREE DAYS LATER,

193
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,400
SO THE STORY GOES

194
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:39,934
EL DIABLO RETURNED
TO AMOS WITH HIS MEN

195
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,434
AND CUT OUT THE
HEART OF EVERY MAN,

196
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:45,200
WOMAN AND CHILD
IN THE WHOLE TOWN

197
00:15:45,267 --> 00:15:48,601
AND JUST LEFT THEM THERE
TO BLEACH IN THE SUN.

198
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:51,701
( woman crying )

199
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,634
SOON, THEY STARTED TO ROT

200
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:56,400
AND THEN THE
BUZZARDS COME

201
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:58,167
AND STARTED PECKIN'
AT THEIR EYES.

202
00:15:58,234 --> 00:16:00,000
SPIVEY, THAT'S
ENOUGH OF THAT.

203
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:02,667
DEVIL DON'T
NEVER DIE!

204
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:04,133
NO, SIR.

205
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,033
SO NO ONE'S
GONNA DO ANYTHING

206
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,000
ABOUT GETTING
MY NETTIE BACK.

207
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,200
PROBABLY CUT OUT
HER HEART AND EATEN IT.

208
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:11,534
OH, MY GOD.

209
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:13,701
I DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN'
ABOUT EATING THEIR HEARTS

210
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,234
HE JUST CUT
'EM OUT AND LEFT.

211
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,300
SPIVEY!

212
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:20,267
I'M SORRY, DEPUTY.

213
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:23,767
OR ARE YOU THE
SHERIFF NOW?

214
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,601
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

215
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,834
TO GO AFTER EL DIABLO.

216
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:30,000
( crowd murmurring )

217
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,300
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT IT, SHERIFF?

218
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,567
AT LAST REPORT,
THE DOC SAYS

219
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:36,234
THE SHERIFF'S FEELIN'
MUCH BETTER.

220
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,601
( chicken clucking )

221
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,267
AND I SUPPOSE
HE'S BEEN WORKIN'

222
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,100
ON HIS SIGN
LANGUAGE, TOO?

223
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,400
( crowd laughing )

224
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,567
SPIVEY'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE THE NEW SHERIFF.

225
00:16:44,634 --> 00:16:46,000
WE PAY YOUR WAGE.

226
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:48,300
( man )
YEAH. RIGHT.

227
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:54,434
I INTEND TO BRING
NETTIE BACK.

228
00:16:56,901 --> 00:17:00,000
I SAID, I INTEND TO
BRING BACK NETTIE.

229
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:06,000
YOU AND WHO ELSE,
SCHOOLTEACHER?

230
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:11,634
ME AND KID DURANGO,
THAT'S WHO.

231
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:13,601
I MEAN,
KID DURANGO AND I.

232
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:17,467
CHARLIE, YOU
GOT COMPETITION.

233
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:20,534
( man )
CAN'T EVEN SHOOT A GUN.

234
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:23,534
( Billy Ray )
I INTEND TO LEARN
TO SHOOT A GUN.

235
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:26,200
EL DIABLO'S GONNA DROP
A LOAD OF MANURE IN

236
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:32,367
HIS PANTS WHEN HE SEES
YOU COMIN' AT HIM.

237
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,267
( gunshots )

238
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:58,701
( Spivey )
I DO KNOW ONE MAN

239
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:02,868
MY SECOND COUSIN
MAGGIE SUE'S BROTHER-IN-LAW

240
00:18:02,934 --> 00:18:05,167
J.D. SHOANS.

241
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,601
( gunshot )

242
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,467
HE'S SOME KIND
OF LAWMAN NOW,

243
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:11,167
TEXAS RANGER.

244
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:12,400
( gunshot )

245
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:17,133
HE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE
RODE WITH KID DURANGO.

246
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,968
( gunshot )

247
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,434
TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

248
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,534
WE NEVER HAD ALL THAT
MUCH TO DO WITH HIM.

249
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,534
( gunshot )

250
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:26,834
SORT OF THE DISGRACE

251
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:30,934
OF THE FAMILY,
YOU KNOW?

252
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,834
( gunshot )

253
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:35,100
HE SHOT AND KILLED
MY COUSIN DEKE

254
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:38,868
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS
AGO UP IN SONOMA.

255
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,634
HE ALSO SHOT
AND KILLED

256
00:18:40,701 --> 00:18:44,534
MY DADDY'S
BROTHER EDWARD.

257
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:45,434
( gunshot )

258
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,567
WHERE'S HE NOW?

259
00:18:46,634 --> 00:18:50,133
THE LAST TIME I HEARD,
HE WAS UP IN MILLENNIUM.

260
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,667
SOME KIND OF MARSHAL
OR RANGER UP THERE.

261
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,267
HELL, AIN'T BUT A
TURD'S DIFFERENCE

262
00:18:57,334 --> 00:19:00,767
BETWEEN J.D. AND
THE SCUM HE HAULS IN.

263
00:19:00,834 --> 00:19:02,434
BUT IF ANYBODY
COULD HELP YOU

264
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:08,200
FIND KID DURANGO,
IT'D BE HIM.

265
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:14,367
YOU NEED BIGGER BOTTLES.

266
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:16,868
YOU BE DARN CAREFUL
WHO YOU SHOW THAT TO.

267
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:23,033
YES, SIR.

268
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:29,434
SHERIFF EDWARDS
WROTE YOU THIS NOTE.

269
00:20:29,501 --> 00:20:34,067
"DON'T GO."

270
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:37,334
THANK HIM FOR
THE ADVICE.

271
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,133
YOU'RE A DARN
FOOL, BILLY RAY.

272
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,767
YES, SIR,
I KNOW.

273
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,467
COME ON, ROJO.

274
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:53,300
ONLY GOD CAN KILL
THE DEVIL, BILLY RAY.

275
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:59,434
FORWARD.

276
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:38,501

( man )
BILLY RAY DONE SHOT HIS HORSE!

 <i>MY JOURNEY DID</i>
 <i>NOT BEGIN ON A GOOD NOTE.</i>

WHERE I CAN FIND
A MR. J.D. SHOANS?

285
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:26,434
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH HIM, SONNY?

286
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:28,367
I JUST HAVE A VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION

287
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,934
I'D LIKE TO ASK HIM.

288
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,834
YOU SHOULD'VE
ASKED HIM YESTERDAY.

289

TO HIS LIFE IN

00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,601
LET'S TAKE A MOMENT
TO ACKNOWLEDGE

295
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,567
HIS CONTRIBUTIONS
TO OUR COMMUNITY.

296
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:53,033
DURING HIS SHORT-LIVED
TERM AS SHERIFF,

297
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,567
HE SERVED THE PUBLIC TO
THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY.

298
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:59,501
HE SHOT EIGHT MEN
AND THREE WOMEN

299
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:03,267
MOST OF WHOM ENGAGED IN
BREAKING THE LAW.

300
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:06,868
I'M SURE THE OTHERS
WERE HONEST MISTAKES.

WHAT HAPPENED?

YEAH.

308
00:23:26,434 --> 00:23:29,234
I'M THE SHERIFF NOW.

309
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
MAYBE I CAN BE OF
SOME ASSISTANCE.

310
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:37,434
( gunshot )

311
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,434

NO, SIR.

WHAT YOU LOOKIN' AT?

YOU JUST SHOT
HIM IN THE BACK.

319
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,033

326
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,601
SAID HE WANTED TO
BE SHERIFF REAL BAD.

327
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,133
NOW HE'S SHERIFF

328
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,267
REAL BAD.

329
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:15,200
REO HERE DON'T LIKE

330
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:16,734
MAYBE YOU CAN

331
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:19,667
I CAN FIND A MAN
NAMED KID DURANGO?

332

WHAT DO YOU
WANT HIM FOR?

333
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:24,033

FASTEST GUN IN THE WEST.

334
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,934
OH, YEAH?

336
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,868

337
00:25:32,934 --> 00:25:36,400

00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:47,367
BUT, I CHEAT

THERE'S YOUR NEW
HORSE UP THERE.

484
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,934
MR. VAN LEEK?

485
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,734
I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU
UP ON YOUR OFFER

486
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:53,234
TO HELP ME GET EL DIABLO.

487
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,033
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

488
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:02,167
COME ON, REO.

489
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,934
THAT WAS AN
IMPRESSIVE DISPLAY

490
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,133
OF GUNMANSHIP TODAY.

491
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,868
GUNMANSHIP?

492
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:40,868
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'D CONSIDER

493
00:39:40,934 --> 00:39:45,667
TEACHING ME A FEW
TRICKS OF THE TRADE.

494
00:39:45,734 --> 00:39:47,901
THEY AIN'T
TRICKS, BOY.

495
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:54,033
THEY'RE MEANS
OF DEATH.

496
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:10,734
HERE.

497
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:20,601
DON'T POINT THAT
THING AT ME, BOY.

498
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:23,067
I AIN'T NO HORSE.

499
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:28,334

504
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:35,868
SHUT YOUR
GODDAMN HOLE, BOY,

505
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:42,000
AND LAY DOWN
ON YOUR BACK.

506
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:50,601

510
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:19,734
THE STAR YOU'RE
FIXIN' ON.

511
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:23,701
IT'S THE BRIGHTEST
STAR IN PEGASUS

512
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:28,033
THE CONSTELLATION
OF THE WINGED HORSE.

513
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,567
RIGHT THERE.

514
00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:32,501
DON'T DROP
YOUR LOOK, BOY.

515
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:35,534
YOU GOTTA
CONCENTRATE.

516
00:41:35,601 --> 00:41:38,033
KEEP YOUR EYE FIXED
ON THAT TARGET,

517
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,400
REAL STEADY.

518
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:41,868
I GOT IT.

519
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:44,667
GOOD.

520
00:41:44,734 --> 00:41:47,400
KEEP IT THERE

521
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:49,701
TILL I TELL
YOU TO STOP.

522
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,100
YES, SIR.

523
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:57,234
GOOD.

524
00:42:01,634 --> 00:42:03,634
DROP YOUR EYES
FROM THAT TARGET,

525
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:09,033
YOU'RE A DEAD MAN.

526
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,200
PATIENCE

527
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,567
CONCENTRATION

528
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:19,701
THE FIRST TWO THINGS
YOU GOTTA LEARN.

529
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:43,167
GOT IT.

530
00:43:08,534 --> 00:43:11,067
( gunshot and horse whinny )

531
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:17,200

YOU BETTER START
PRAYIN' THAT WASN'T REO.

532
00:43:41,534 --> 00:43:47,601

533
00:43:54,033 --> 00:44:00,100
BEBE?

534
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:14,801
YOU MISSED.

535
00:44:14,868 --> 00:44:17,634
HE MISSED?

536
00:44:17,701 --> 00:44:24,734
I GUESS THE BALANCE
AIN'T QUITE RIGHT.

537
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:27,000
WHERE THE HELL
DID YOU GET THAT?

538
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:29,434
RIGHT OFF THE SON
OF A BITCH'S BOOT.

539
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:31,100
YOU GOT IT.

540
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:33,300
THIS BOY
HERE GOT IT.

541
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:36,200
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
THEY STOLE HIS GIRL.

542
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:38,267
ACTUALLY, SHE WAS
ONE OF MY STUDENTS.

543
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:41,200
PRETTIEST ONE IN
THE  CLASS, I'LL BET.

544
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:42,501
I MAKE IT A POLICY

545
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:46,434
NOT TO GET INVOLVED
WITH MY STUDENTS.

546
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:47,968
( laughter )

547
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:51,434
THINK THIS'LL
GET US IN?

548
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:53,701
COULD BE.

549
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:57,234
OL' EL DIABLO DOES
FAVOR HIS SPURS.

550
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,267
GETTING IN'S
THE EASY PART.

551
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:01,801
IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE
WHOLE DAMN THING

552
00:45:01,868 --> 00:45:03,534
IN WITH YOU

553
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:10,801
YOU JUST MIGHT GET BACK
OUT AGAIN IN ONE PIECE.

554
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:13,934
WHAT THE HELL YOU
LOOKIN' AT, BOY?

555
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,834
NOTHIN'.

556

01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:03,067
AREN'T YOU GOING TO INTRODUCE
ME TO YOUR FRIEND?

793
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:05,501
THIS HERE IS
BILLY RAY SMITH.

794
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:10,067
BOY, THIS HERE IS
TRUMAN FEATHERS

795
01:02:10,133 --> 01:02:15,767
SOMETIMES KNOWN
AS KID DURANGO.

796
01:02:15,834 --> 01:02:17,734
KID DURANGO?

797
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:21,434
UH-HUH.
KID DURANGO.

798
01:02:21,501 --> 01:02:22,801
KID DURANGO?

799
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:24,667
UH-HUH.

800
01:02:24,734 --> 01:02:29,133
THIS BOY HAS READ EVERY
ONE OF YOUR BOOKS.

801
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,801
REALLY?

802
01:02:31,868 --> 01:02:37,968
KID DURANGO?

803
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:41,734
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO THIS HOLE?

804
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:45,367
I'M RESEARCHING
OUR NEXT ADVENTURE.

805
01:02:45,434 --> 01:02:47,033
SMOKE SIGNALS
INDICATED THAT

806
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:52,300
YOU WERE HEADED
IN THIS DIRECTION.

807
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:55,701
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A
HAT JUST LIKE THAT.

808
01:02:55,767 --> 01:02:58,934
I LOVE YOUR OUTFIT.

809
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,834
( Truman )
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

810
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:03,634
ORIGINALLY BOSTON,
MASSACHUSETTS.

811
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:08,234
REALLY?  I'VE BEEN
TO RHODE ISLAND.

812
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,167
WHAT DID HE MEAN
WHEN HE SAID,

813
01:03:10,234 --> 01:03:11,868
"OUR NEXT ADVENTURE?"

814
01:03:11,934 --> 01:03:15,133
IT'S A WONDERFUL
ARRANGEMENT.

815
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,033
THOMAS RUNS AROUND THE WEST,
RISKING HIS SILLY NECK

816
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:29,133
AND I INCORPORATE HIS EXPLOITS
INTO MY LITTLE TRUE STORIES.

817
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,234
YOU MEAN--

818
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,601
WHAT HE MEANS IS,
AIN'T NOBODY GONNA BUY

819
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:36,901
NO STORIES ABOUT
NO NEGRO COWBOYS.

820
01:03:36,968 --> 01:03:39,334
IT'S DRAMATIC
LICENSE, REALLY.

821
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,968
IT'S A NECESSARY EVIL
IN THE LITERARY WORLD.

822
01:03:42,033 --> 01:03:47,234
DRAMATIC LICENSE, HELL!
WHOLE BUNCH OF LIES.

823
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,334
YOU MADE ALL THAT MONEY
AND I NEVER DID SEE SQUAT.

824
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,868
WHAT REALLY GETS
ME IS ALL THAT CRAP

825
01:03:52,934 --> 01:03:55,868
ABOUT "LOOKIN' A
MAN IN THE EYE."

826
01:03:55,934 --> 01:03:59,200
HELL, A MAN DON'T GO FOR
A GUN WITH HIS EYE.

827
01:03:59,267 --> 01:04:02,133
LOOK AT HIS HAND.

828
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,501
I'LL MAKE A
NOTE OF IT.

829
01:04:05,567 --> 01:04:11,634
( men yelling )

830
01:04:19,467 --> 01:04:25,534
THEY WERE WITH
EL DIABLO IN THE BANK.

831
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:34,167
THE UNATTRACTIVE
ONE IS PESTOSO.

832
01:04:34,234 --> 01:04:36,400
THAT OTHER ONE
AIN'T NO LADY-KILLER.

833
01:04:36,467 --> 01:04:39,234
YES, THAT'S
CHAK MOL.

834
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,534
( Billy Ray )
DO YOU KNOW THEM?

835
01:04:40,601 --> 01:04:43,033
( Truman )
THEY COME HERE
TO UNWIND AFTER

836
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:46,701
THEIR FORAYS OF
RAPING AND PILLAGING.

837
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:49,901
I'VE INTERVIEWED
BOTH OF THEM.

838
01:04:49,968 --> 01:04:56,701
PESTOSO IS
SURPRISINGLY VOCAL.

839
01:04:56,767 --> 01:05:02,834
HEY, BOY.

840
01:05:02,901 --> 01:05:05,000
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT BEING

841
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:11,200
THE FASTEST GUN
IN THE WEST?

842
01:05:11,267 --> 01:05:17,334
HUH?

843
01:05:32,601 --> 01:05:40,434
SO, YOU'RE THE FASTEST
GUN IN THE WEST?

844
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:44,968
DO YOU KNOW TO
WHOM THIS BELONGS?

845
01:05:45,033 --> 01:05:47,100
WHERE YOU
GET THAT?

846
01:05:47,167 --> 01:05:49,467
CAN YOU TAKE
ME TO HIM?

847
01:05:49,534 --> 01:05:51,534
TAKE YOU TO WHO?

848
01:05:51,601 --> 01:05:55,601
"TAKE YOU TO WHOM."

849
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:59,734
( speaking Spanish )

850
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:05,033
EL DIABLO.

851
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:11,167
EL DIABLO?

852
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:24,334
WHERE YOU GOIN',
GRINGO?

853
01:07:04,167 --> 01:07:10,234
( knuckes cracking )

854
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,934
( speaking Spanish )

855
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,067
( gunshots )

856
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:58,133
( Billy Ray )
 <i>I HAD SHOT A</i>
 <i>MAN IN A SHOWDOWN</i>

857
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,334
 <i>IN THE MIDDLE OF THE</i>
 <i>STREET AT HIGH NOON.</i>

858
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,501
 <i>ACTUALLY, IT WAS MUCH</i>
 <i>LATER IN THE DAY,</i>

859
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:07,434
 <i>BUT IT WAS STILL</i>
 <i>QUITE A THRILL.</i>

860
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:09,167
GOOD SHOT, BOY.

861
01:08:09,234 --> 01:08:10,767
 <i>I DON'T CONDONE KILLING,</i>

862
01:08:10,834 --> 01:08:13,567
 <i>BUT THIS PESTOSO</i>
 <i>PROBABLY DESERVED IT.</i>

863
01:08:13,634 --> 01:08:16,000
 <i>IF HE TRAVELED WITH</i>
 <i>EL DIABLO, HE HAD</i>

 <i>SOME SEVERE CHARACTER</i>
 <i>FLAWS, I WAS SURE.</i>

865
01:08:20,734 --> 01:08:26,801
GOOD SHOT.

866
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:48,567
YOU?

867
01:09:00,534 --> 01:09:03,467
I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE MORNING

868
01:09:03,534 --> 01:09:06,901
JUST OUTSIDE
OF TOWN

869
01:09:06,968 --> 01:09:10,767
THE TREE OF DEATH.

870
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:14,234
( Chak Mol )
COME ALONE.

871
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:20,400
TREE OF DEATH?

872
01:09:24,534 --> 01:09:27,200
OUCH!

873
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:29,300
( speaking Spanish )

874
01:09:29,367 --> 01:09:32,567
NEVER TRUST A MAN WHO
TALKS TO HIS SNAKE.

875
01:09:32,634 --> 01:09:37,033
IT'S TRUMAN.

876
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:43,267
MORNING.

877
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:45,434
( Thomas )
WHAT THE HELL YOU
DOIN', FEATHERS?

878
01:09:45,501 --> 01:09:47,400
WELL,

879
01:09:47,467 --> 01:09:49,501
I'VE DECIDED TO JOIN
YOUR EXPEDITION.

880
01:09:49,567 --> 01:09:52,000
NOT WITH ME,
YOU AIN'T.

881
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:54,033
YOU WON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT ME.

882
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,467
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

883
01:09:55,534 --> 01:09:57,801
I'M WORRIED ABOUT US,
WITH YOU OUT THERE.

884
01:09:57,868 --> 01:09:59,701
OH, THOMAS, PLEASE.

885
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:01,100
I'M SURE I CAN PERFORM

886
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:03,667
SOME VERY USEFUL
FUNCTIONS ON THE TRAIL.

887
01:10:03,734 --> 01:10:06,567
AND BESIDES, I'M
AN EXCELLENT COOK.

888
01:10:06,634 --> 01:10:09,334
CAN YOU MAKE COFFEE?

889
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,801
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

890
01:10:10,868 --> 01:10:13,067
I BROUGHT SOME FRESH
COLUMBIAN BEANS.

891
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:17,434
AND, BY THE WAY, I MAKE
A WONDERFUL OMELET.

892
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:19,234
( Dancing Bear )
WHAT IS "OMELET?"

893
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:23,934
AN OMELET IS DICED HAM,
CHEESE, PEPPERS

894
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,601
FOLDED INTO THREE
EGGS, COOKED

895
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:28,501
IN AN IRON SKILLET,
SLIGHTLY WARMED.

896
01:10:28,567 --> 01:10:31,834
MUSHROOMS, SNAKE MEAT,
SQUASH? GOOD?

897
01:10:31,901 --> 01:10:34,767
GOOD? I WOULDN'T
RECOMMEND THE SQUASH BUT

898
01:10:34,834 --> 01:10:36,400
IT'S ENTIRELY
UP TO YOU.

899
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:39,734
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
LET'S MOVE OUT!

900
01:10:39,801 --> 01:10:46,234
COME ON.

901
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,367
FORWARD!

902
01:10:48,434 --> 01:10:50,501
( Billy Ray )
 <i>THOUGH STILL PUZZLED</i>
 <i>BY THE REVELATION</i>

903
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:52,634
 <i>THAT TRUMAN WAS</i>
 <i>KID DURANGO</i>

904
01:10:52,701 --> 01:10:54,100
 <i>OR NOT KID DURANGO,</i>

905
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,033
 <i>I WAS EXCITED THAT</i>
 <i>HE HAD JOINED US.</i>

906

 <i>IT AFFORDED ME</i>
 <i>THE OPPORTUNITY</i>

 <i>TO CLEAR UP MY CONFUSION</i>

 <i>AND I LOOKED FORWARD</i>
 <i>TO ONE OF HIS OMELETS</i> .

909
01:11:02,067 --> 01:11:04,400
NOW, I STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND

910
01:11:04,467 --> 01:11:07,033
WHY YOU'RE COMIN'
ALONG WITH US.

911
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,167
ACTUALLY, IT'S YOUR
EXAMPLE, BILLY RAY.

912
01:11:10,234 --> 01:11:11,434
I'VE ALWAYS WRITTEN

913
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,033
ABOUT OTHER
PEOPLE'S EXPLOITS.

914
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,501
I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT
BEFORE I PASS ON

915
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:19,801
I COULD INCLUDE A FEW
ADVENTURES OF MY VERY OWN.

916
01:11:19,868 --> 01:11:21,868
THAT WAS A WONDERFUL
MOMENT YESTERDAY

917
01:11:21,934 --> 01:11:24,634
IN THE STREETS WITH
YOU AND PESTOSO.

918
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:28,100
IT WAS THRILLING,
VIRTUALLY WRITES ITSELF.

919
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:31,100
YOU'RE GONNA PUT ME
IN ONE OF YOUR BOOKS?

920
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:35,300
OF COURSE. EVERY
STORY NEEDS ITS HERO.

921
01:11:35,367 --> 01:11:38,300

HEY, BOY, LEMME
SEE THAT SPUR.

922
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:44,434
YES, SIR.

923
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:50,434
YOU HOLD ONTO
THAT HALF, BOY.

924
01:11:50,501 --> 01:11:52,667
THAT'S YOUR
CALLING CARD.

925
01:11:52,734 --> 01:11:54,167
GO AHEAD ON.

926
01:11:54,234 --> 01:11:57,467
BE RIGHT BEHIND
YOU. GO ON.

927
01:11:57,534 --> 01:11:59,200
GOOD LUCK,
BILLY RAY.

928
01:11:59,267 --> 01:12:05,367
THANK YOU.
GOODBYE.

929
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,501
EXCUSE ME, COULD
YOU TELL ME PRECISELY

930
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:27,267
WHY THEY CALL THIS
THE TREE OF DEATH?

931
01:12:27,334 --> 01:12:30,167
( Billy Ray )
EXCUSE ME.

932
01:12:30,234 --> 01:12:32,000

SORRY.

941
01:13:35,467 --> 01:13:39,400
THEY'RE TOO SPLIT UP FOR
US TO GET ALL AT ONCE.

942
01:13:39,467 --> 01:13:40,868
I THINK THERE
MIGHT JUST BE

943

A SOLUTION TO THIS

THAT LEFT TUNNEL WILL LET YOU
OUT ABOVE THE VILLAGE.

949

WAIT FOR MY SIGNAL.
GOOD ENOUGH?

950
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:15,200
I THINK A LITTLE
PRAYER IS IN ORDER

951
01:15:15,267 --> 01:15:17,334
BEFORE WE EMBARK ON
THIS PERILOUS ORDEAL.

952
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,501
IF YOU WILL ALL JOIN ME IN
RECITING THE LORD'S PRAYER.

IT'S PERFECTLY OBVIOUS TO
ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

966

YOU'RE USING THIS

967
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:15,567
SO THAT YOU CAN STEAL AS
MUCH GOLD AS YOU CAN CARRY.

1103
01:30:58,534 --> 01:31:00,934
( El Diablo )
HELLO, LITTLE BOY.

1104
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,667
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

1105
01:31:04,734 --> 01:31:07,734
I WANT THE GIRL.

1106
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:10,467
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO GET HER BACK?

1107
01:31:10,534 --> 01:31:16,601
WITH YOUR
LITTLE STICK?

1108
01:31:21,067 --> 01:31:23,501
GIVE UP THE
GIRL, DIABLO.

1109
01:31:23,567 --> 01:31:27,767
WHO IS THIS,
LITTLE BOY?

1110
01:31:27,834 --> 01:31:34,100
MY NAME

1111
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:39,801
IS KID DURANGO.

1112
01:31:39,868 --> 01:31:41,901
KID DURANGO?

1113
01:31:41,968 --> 01:31:44,934
AM I TO BE FRIGHTENED
BY THIS NAME?

1114
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:53,100
TRUMAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

1115
01:31:53,167 --> 01:31:55,734
YES, I DO.

1116
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:58,567
TRUMAN.

1117
01:31:58,634 --> 01:32:02,167
( El Diablo )
BUT YOU ARE THE GUEST,

1118
01:32:02,234 --> 01:32:08,334
I WILL WAIT FOR YOU TO
MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

1119
01:32:28,534 --> 01:32:34,601
( gunshot )

1120
01:32:40,901 --> 01:32:45,534
TRUMAN, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

1121
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:48,067
YES, I DID.

1122
01:32:48,133 --> 01:32:54,701
( Truman )
I DID.

1123
01:32:54,767 --> 01:32:56,701
IT HURTS.

1124
01:32:56,767 --> 01:33:03,334
I'M SORRY.

1125
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:06,667
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT THE PAIN.

1126
01:33:06,734 --> 01:33:13,300
I ASSUMED IT WOULD
BE OVER QUICKLY.

1127
01:33:13,367 --> 01:33:18,067
PERHAPS I SHOULD'VE
LOOKED AT HIS HANDS

1128
01:33:18,133 --> 01:33:24,200
NOT HIS EYES.

1129
01:33:24,267 --> 01:33:30,667
YOU'RE RUINING A
PERFECTLY GOOD SCARF.

1130
01:33:30,734 --> 01:33:36,801
I'M SORRY.

1131
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:43,267
I WANT YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.

1132
01:33:43,334 --> 01:33:48,367
ANYTHING,
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

1133
01:33:48,434 --> 01:33:51,934
KILL HIM.

1134
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,200
KILL EL DIABLO.

1135
01:33:55,267 --> 01:34:01,334
( Truman )
COMPLETE THE STORY, BILLY RAY.

1136
01:34:06,901 --> 01:34:10,901
TRUMAN, YOU'RE
NOT GONNA DIE.

1137
01:34:10,968 --> 01:34:14,767
I KNOW.

1138
01:34:14,834 --> 01:34:20,934
I'VE NEVER
FELT SO ALIVE.

1139
01:34:31,133 --> 01:34:34,701
IN WHOSE ARMS ARE YOU
GOING TO DIE, LITTLE BOY?

1140
01:34:34,767 --> 01:34:36,801
HE DIDN'T EVEN
GO FOR HIS GUN.

1141
01:34:36,868 --> 01:34:39,100
I WAS GETTING BORED.

1142
01:34:39,167 --> 01:34:42,367
I'M A BUSY MAN.

1143
01:34:42,434 --> 01:34:45,000
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE
ME TO SHOOT YOU?

1144
01:34:45,067 --> 01:34:48,100
I WILL GIVE YOU THE CHOICE.

1145
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:49,300
WHERE?

1146
01:34:49,367 --> 01:34:55,467
( speaking Spanish )

1147
01:35:05,801 --> 01:35:08,267
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
THE STOMACH.

1148
01:35:08,334 --> 01:35:11,467
IT IS VERY PAINFUL AND
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO DIE.

1149
01:35:11,534 --> 01:35:13,934
BUT MAKE A DECISION
QUICKLY, PLEASE.

1150
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,400
YOU HAVE SEEN,
I'M AN IMPATIENT MAN.

1151
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:19,334
HOW ABOUT YOU
JUST WING ME

1152
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:25,501
ON THE SHOULDER
RIGHT ABOUT HERE.

1153
01:35:25,567 --> 01:35:29,667
YOU ARE VERY FUNNY,
LITTLE BOY.

1154
01:35:29,734 --> 01:35:35,000
I THINK MAYBE

1155
01:35:35,067 --> 01:35:42,300
( speaking Spanish )

1156
01:35:42,367 --> 01:35:48,434
( Thomas )
DIABLO!

1157
01:36:35,334 --> 01:36:39,000
FINALLY, SOMEONE WHO IS
WORTHY OF THE CHALLENGE.

1158
01:36:39,067 --> 01:36:41,968
CUT THE BULLSHIT,
EL DIABLO.

1159
01:36:42,033 --> 01:36:48,100
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

1160

1161

1163
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:15,400
YOU WANNA
TRY AGAIN?

( gunshot )

1166
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:18,901
DAMN, BOY! YOU SHOT
HIM IN THE BACK.

1167
01:39:18,968 --> 01:39:25,033
WELL, HIS BACK
WAS TO ME.

1168
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:38,534
I FORGOT.

1169
