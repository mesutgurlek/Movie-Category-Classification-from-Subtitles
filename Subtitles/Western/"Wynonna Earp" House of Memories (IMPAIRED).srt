00:08:17,026 --> 00:08:19,093
Everything is in place,
right, Cryderman?

162
00:08:19,095 --> 00:08:22,830
Yes. An ice sculpture, champagne...

163
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:24,732
Rivers of champagne.

164
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:26,867
And the Wainwright?

165
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:29,970
See, why would you want that old hotel,

166
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:32,239
- when I can get you...
[growling]

167
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:35,142
We got it. I was only asking, Bobo.

168
00:08:35,745 --> 00:08:37,277
That is a Bobo no-no.

169
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:41,348
It's all exactly
like you wanted, I swear.

170
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:43,817
Huzzah.

171
00:08:43,819 --> 00:08:45,753
He lives to see another day.

172
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:49,923
- [woman screaming in pain]
- Please. Make it stop.

173
00:08:49,925 --> 00:08:52,259
[screaming]

174
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,997
[plash]

175
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:01,335
[screaming]

176
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:07,374
Bravo. Bravo!

177
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:12,112
- Bubs, you never disappoint.
- [cooing]

178
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:20,320
Now, you see, right there.

179
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:24,191
Dial it back five percent,
and our plan will be perfection.

180
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:34,835
[growling]

181
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,409
It's a happy day. Ah, ah!

182
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,777
- [whistling]
- Deputy Marshal Dolls.

183
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,646
Oh yeah? And what's your story, honey?

184
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,683
Well, for starters,

185
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:55,952
my coat may be cute but it's
way too thin for this weather,

186
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:57,854
and then I totally forgot
to exfoliate this morning

187
00:09:57,856 --> 00:09:59,756
and now I have to take the biggest whiz.

188
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,891
Mind if we step inside for just a sec?

189
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:03,860
Much as I'd like to see you
with your panties off...

190
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:06,562
...you all can go screw
yourselves a good day.

191
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:14,170
Oh God! You know littering
is bad for the heart, right?

192
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:15,738
- How's that?
- Because when you litter...

193
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,540
- Oof!
- [groaning]

194
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,445
- I hit you in the heart.
- Storytime's over, bitch.

195
00:10:23,648 --> 00:10:27,016
- Come on, Earp.
- Yes sir, Mr. Deputy Marshal.

196
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:34,791
I'm exhausted.

197
00:10:35,894 --> 00:10:36,859
Hey...

198
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,602
I know, baby.

199
00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:21,704
Shit.

200
00:11:22,607 --> 00:11:24,941
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

201
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:28,578
Wow. Wynonna never said anything

202
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,613
about you being a...

203
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:33,583
...a gay.

204
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,754
Oh geez. You haven't told her.

205
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:40,022
I have to go.

206
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:45,828
Call me later.

207
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,003
Wynonna'd probably be pretty
pissed if she found out

208
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,906
you didn't tell her something
like this, wouldn't she?

209
00:11:57,876 --> 00:11:58,774
There it is.

210
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:03,679
You remember that beam?

211
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:06,749
When I was four,

212
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:08,951
you caught me going
through Daddy's drawer

213
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:11,854
and you promised not to tell, if...

214
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:14,790
...I walked across that beam.

215
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:16,526
I didn't...

216
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,896
- Daddy was...
- What?

217
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:21,831
Attentive?

218
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,408
Huh? Aware of your birthday?

219
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:30,952
Willa, I could have broken my neck.

220
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,050
- [shout]
- I figured you all for human.

221
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,053
- The Machetes don't discriminate.
- Me either!

222
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:56,966
[shouting]

223
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,138
Welcome aboard the Earp Express.

224
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:04,707
Enjoy your trip to Hell.

225
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,980
- That ain't working right.
- It's fine.

226
00:13:14,986 --> 00:13:18,020
Alright. Start talking,
or I take your head for a spin.

227
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:19,622
Alright, alright!

228
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,757
So who hired you sacks
of shit to kill me, huh?

229
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,093
The judge, man. Sometimes
he hires us to pull jobs.

230
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:26,896
Cryderman. Where the hell is he?

231
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:29,065
- And why does he want me dead?
- I don't know.

232
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,000
We just picked up a bag
of money from Shorty's,

233
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:33,484
didn't ask for nothing
but a picture for the hit.

234
00:13:33,486 --> 00:13:34,798
[panting]

235
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,105
Well, I'm gonna need that bag.

236
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,907
[panting]

237
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:42,945
Shit. If I'd known your life
was worth this much...

238
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,146
We're giving it to charity.

239
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,882
[scoffing]

240
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,852
Of course. Puppies and orphans.

241
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:50,820
Perfect.

242
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,078
Dolls, something happened back there...

243
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:56,916
You did well.

244
00:13:57,895 --> 00:13:58,761
OK?

245
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:03,165
Man... You know, when I first met you...

246
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,901
Girl, you were a mess.

247
00:14:05,903 --> 00:14:07,069
- Hey!
- What?

248
00:14:07,071 --> 00:14:09,171
"Hot." I prefer "hot" mess.

249
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,741
[complete exhalation]

250
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:16,712
Now I wouldn't want to fight
with anyone else by my side.

251
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,421
I'm hungry, you hungry?

252
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,844
Look, I have to show
you something, alright?

253
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,761
[Dolls] Nedley found the car on the
edge of the Ghost River Triangle.

254
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:35,097
It was pointed back towards Purgatory.

255
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,934
They said there was no body, so...

256
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:47,009
Earp, if anyone can get out
of a burning car,

257
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,077
it'd be Doc Holliday.

258
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,980
He'd only just learned to drive.

259
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:04,894
[whistling wind]

260
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:14,003
Ah!

261
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:18,708
- You can't come here.
- I'm not going to hurt you.

262
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,243
You already have.
I can see it in your eyes.

263
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,880
One day, I'll remember how...

264
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,982
...and I'll come for you.

265
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:32,254
[gunshot]

266
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:36,492
Back the hell up or I'll shoot
you for real, Bobo Del Rey.

267
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:38,060
- You can't kill me.
- No.

268
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,196
But I can bring the pain.

269
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,812
- Hey!
- I'm so sorry I made you walk on beams.

270
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:59,014
No, no. I'm sorry I called you a bitch.

271
00:16:00,518 --> 00:16:01,350
In my head.

272
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:04,787
What's that?

273
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,990
I have no idea what it means.

274
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,262
I think I do.

275
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,234
[humming]

276
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:21,003
[sniffing, howling]

277
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,838
Oh!

278
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,374
- [laughing]
- Oh!

279
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:32,640
I'm a lucky man, happening
on you like I done.

280
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:35,543
Yeah. Your knife skills

281
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:37,445
are legendary.

282
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:40,381
I've been a fan for years.

283
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:43,451
Oh, it is so nice to meet an admirer.

284
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:46,414
And I must say, you are
the spitting image

285
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,415
of your brother, Vinnie.

286
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:50,851
You ratted him out to Wynonna.

287
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:53,053
Oh, bygones, my friend.

288
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:56,022
- Bubba, isn't it?
- Big Bubba.

289
00:16:56,258 --> 00:16:57,324
Of course.

290
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,227
And I suspect from your fine
chemistry skills,

291
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:02,129
Mr. Bubba,

292
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:05,416
that you are here
on assignment. For whom?

293
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:08,168
I want a lesson.

294
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,071
I want answers.

295
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:12,632
And my hat.

296
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:15,809
Since we're opening up to one another.

297
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:17,944
Bobo Del Rey.

298
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,147
That's who hired me.

299
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,217
Any specifics on this "job?"

300
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,953
One question, one answer,

301
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:30,323
one lesson. And I'm keeping the hat.

302
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,959
- Of course.
- Yah.

303
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,228
Yah... Well, this time...

304
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,263
Yah. Hem...

305
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,933
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

306
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,838
[Doc] ...plant your feet as
though rooted to the very ground.

307
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:46,306
Now I beg of you,

308
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:48,241
and I do mean beg,

309
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:51,011
shoot from the elbow, not the shoulder.

310
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:53,814
- I cannot emphasize this enough.
- The elbow!

311
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,184
[laughing]

312
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,920
Very good, Mr. Bubba.

313
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:03,223
- A faster learner there never was.
- Yah.

314
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:05,893
Another drink, if you don't mind.

315
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:20,006
Ahh! Much obliged.

316
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,474
[panting]

317
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,028
Now, how long do you
intend to keep me here?

318
00:18:23,053 --> 00:18:25,612
- Yah. Until they're gone.
- Who?

319
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:27,113
Everyone.

320
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:37,354
Hey, hey, hey. Look, you don't
have to do this, OK, right now.

321
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:39,356
- Are you screwing with me?
- Oh, God.

322
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:42,359
Someone got to Doc and they're trying
to kill you, then they're winning.

323
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:44,461
And I will not let them win.

324
00:18:44,463 --> 00:18:46,497
Look, we don't have to go in
guns blazing. We have time.

325
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:49,199
Huh. Tell that to Cryderman.

326
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:51,368
What? Cryderman?

327
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,037
I think he's about to kill himself.

328
00:18:57,443 --> 00:19:00,377
Hey! Quick! No!

329
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:03,147
I wanna die.

330
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:06,215
- Oh, I want that for you too, Judge.
- [sobbing]

331
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:08,403
-But you gotta give answers first,
crybaby.

332
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,917
You hired a bunch of ex-military
bikers to assassinate me.

333
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:16,827
- Why?
- He forced my hand.

334
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,562
- Who?
- Bobo.

335
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,792
It's always been Bobo.

336
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:23,528
He cuts and I bleed.

337
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,664
Money, dignity, my very soul.

338
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,666
He's reduced me to nothing.

339
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,767
Aww.

340
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,603
The way you reduced so many
young delinquents, huh?

341
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,639
Wow! Full circle.

342
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,841
Pure poetry.

343
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,743
You two could walk away
from this prison.

344
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,579
- I'm a lifer.
- [Dolls] You gotta start talking.

345
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,017
Bobo's throwing a party tonight
at the old Wainwright.

346
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,986
I figured him for more retro
roller rink, less heritage hotel.

347
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,222
He insisted.

348
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,524
Anything about a clue? A lead?

349
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,560
He's obsessed with that thing.

350
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:57,462
-It's a thing?

351
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,697
So what is it?

352
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,566
Does he have it?

353
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,568
- No idea.
[sniffling]

354
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:09,006
Right. So, the Wainwright houses
a bunch of antiques, right?

355
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,709
- Maybe the lead could be there.
- [Wynonna] We get in there,

356
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,078
get it first, there goes
his ticket out of the Triangle.

357
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:18,483
Alright. You're gonna
get us into that party.

358
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:19,917
[Dolls] Do you not check your mail?

359
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,620
The whole town is invited.
Black tie, no guns.

360
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,689
- The whole town.
- Yeah, everybody.

361
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,791
- All of the town.
- Even... yeah.

362
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,962
Great. Then you're coming with
us, and you're going to help.

363
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:31,996
No, no, no. I can't.

364
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:33,798
Bobo will know I betrayed him.

365
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,500
We'll protect you, don't worry.

366
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:37,535
You can barely protect
yourselves. Who are we kidding?

367
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:41,739
Yeah, well, shit happens.

368
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,710
Shit happens. Ha!

369
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:47,912
I like that.

370
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,082
[gunshot]

371
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,024
[Bubba grunting]

372
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:03,027
[Doc] The ground here tremors
more than open fields.

373
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,062
But not enough for the Big City.

374
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:08,833
- Purgatory, are we?
- 'Spose we are.

375
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,903
No doubt the powder there will play

376
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:13,905
a significant part in one of Bobo's

377
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,640
more nefarious plans.

378
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:19,977
The most significant part.
It's complicated.

379
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,747
You know,

380
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,683
there was a time when
I fashioned my own gunpowder...

381
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,545
...and though the ratio of a perfect

382
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,756
75:15:10 was imperative,

383
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:34,759
I found the secret
was in crafting my own.

384
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:36,627
You made your own saltpeter?

385
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:38,829
Well, if you saw

386
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,699
- what this could do...
- Son,

387
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,935
I'm frickin' Doc Holliday.

388
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:46,037
Nothing impresses me anymore.

389
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,039
Well, frickin'

390
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,608
Doc Holliday... Ha!

391
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,978
There's a pleasant fragrance. Peaches?

392
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,980
Yeah. Peaches.

393
00:21:59,018 --> 00:21:59,984
Hello!

394
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,990
- [hissing]
- Yah. Yah, yah, yah, yah.

395
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,662
- No!
- Shh, shh.

396
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,599
That's enough, there, little rabbit.

397
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:16,834
[retching]

398
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,841
Oh... oh...

399
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:34,018
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

400
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,787
[laughing]

401
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,689
Oh yah, yah, yah, yah!

402
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:40,958
Oh...

403
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:45,630
[laughing]

404
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:46,764
Wonderful.

405
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,101
[birds chirping]

406
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:52,103
[Willa] No cabins, no boats,

407
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,004
no people.

408
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:56,407
For a place with such a beautiful name,

409
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,175
Swan Reservoir sure is creepy.

410
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,112
- You recognize anything?
- No.

411
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,048
- Do you think this is where...
- Yeah.

412
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:06,917
It's a protected bird sanctuary

413
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:09,420
in the ever revenant-friendly
Ghost River Triangle.

414
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:10,821
The perfect place to...

415
00:23:12,118 --> 00:23:14,218
- ...cage a...
- To cage a young bird.

416
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:20,931
Willa?

417
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:23,801
This is it.

418
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:28,973
Some cage.

419
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:49,694
The view's quite pretty.

420
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,729
Seriously?

421
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,202
I'm sorry. This is so many different
kinds of horrible. I was learning

422
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,770
how to ride a bike,

423
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,239
and playing woodland
princess after school,

424
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,274
and you...

425
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,712
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

426
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:17,988
[panting]

[panting]

429
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:28,899
A woman.

430
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:31,736
With a pink car.

431
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,772
A witch.

432
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:37,174
Constance Clootie.

433
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,979
Do you even know
the definition of "free?"

434
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:45,282
You. Can. Go.

435
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,157
- What did you do to my head?
- Gave it a little cleanse.

436
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:55,760
All those pesky memories, gone.

437
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,929
You're better off without them,
dear. Now come on.

438
00:24:58,931 --> 00:24:59,897
Chop chop.

439
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,838
She may have rescued me...

440
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,341
...but I had no idea
what price I would pay.

441
00:25:11,565 --> 00:25:12,565
Your memories.

442
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:14,819
They're coming back now.

443
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,066
They are.

444
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:39,559
Oh my god, they are.

445
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,975
There's so much to do.

[cell phone ringing]

Why in the world would you
need my dress size?

00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:03,227
Hey.

450
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:06,864
This is what you'll be wearing
to the Winter Solstice.

451
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:10,100
- OK, cool. What does it do?
- It covers your body.

452
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,203
Yeah, but is it bulletproof?

453
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:15,906
- Does it have cameras in it? Sensors?
- Yes, to none of those things.

454
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:18,459
I can bring my own damn dress.

455

You wearing your midriff-baring baby tee

456

and your "good jeans" isn't
really black tie.

457
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:25,249
We gotta blend in with the people
of Purgatory, not scare them.

00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,985
- Ha! Bobo will do that.
- Yeah.

459
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:29,920
Look at this.

460
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,989
Nothing but dark corners
and lots of rooms.

Whatever he's planning,
whatever he's looking for,

it's a total mystery.

What part of "stay on the Homestead"

- didn't you understand?
- We found it.

The Swan Reservoir.

467
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:47,872
The place I was kept all those years.

468
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:48,860
It was Bobo.

469
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:51,684
And these were scattered everywhere.

470
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,150
- But then I was rescued.
- Yeah,

471
00:26:55,152 --> 00:26:58,087
- by Constance Clootie.
- But she erased my memories.

472
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,752
[Wynonna] Constance Clootie never does

473
00:26:59,778 --> 00:27:01,782
anything unless it benefits
Constance Clootie.

474
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:03,759
There's more.

475
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,029
We have a deal?

476
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,400
Where have all the honorable men gone?

477
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,936
Dead, I suppose.

478
00:27:13,938 --> 00:27:17,172
Your great-granddaddy Wyatt would
never have aligned with a revenant.

479
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:19,875
- I'm not Wyatt.
- No shit.

But what's done is done.

- So are we in agreement?
- We have ourselves a deal.

Then the Lead is yours.

Bobo already has the lead.

00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,126
Not according to Constance.
What, did he lose it?

485

Well, clearly he's found it again.

00:27:40,064 --> 00:27:41,897
[Waverly] OK, none of this
is clear to me.

487
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:43,832
We think the lead is at the hotel.

488
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:45,868
It's a trap. You realize that, right?

489
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,970
Look, he doesn't know
that we know about the Lead.

490
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:50,205
- Maybe we can get there before him.
- We'll be outnumbered.

491
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:52,026
Nothing outnumbers three Earps.

492
00:27:52,543 --> 00:27:54,843
I've bumped up against worse problems.

493
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:56,355
Yeah, but why bring Champ into this?

494
00:27:56,514 --> 00:27:58,013
[Dolls] We need all hands on deck.

495
00:28:01,492 --> 00:28:03,892
Fine. But we make a plan,

496
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,593
and we stick with it. Deal?

497
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:07,890
- Deal.
- Yeah, deal.

498
00:28:09,994 --> 00:28:11,326
That's not what you're wearing,
though, is it?

499
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:12,094
No.

500
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:15,364
Not wearing that either.

501
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:21,136
You're right! It's all in the elbow.

502
00:28:21,138 --> 00:28:24,072
You are a master in the making.

503
00:28:24,074 --> 00:28:24,940
Ha!

504
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:27,528
This is what we've been
waiting for, is it?

505
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:31,024
Awesome. One more day, bro,

506
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:34,160
and we're free.
Bringing your new friend?

507
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:37,263
- Makes one helluva trophy.
- You talk too much.

508
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:38,398
Ha, ha, ha! I hear that.

509
00:28:39,106 --> 00:28:42,535
It's going to be some party,
though. Shit is going down.

510
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:45,238
Wish we were there to see it.

511
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,306
Now you deliver that straight to Bobo.

512
00:28:48,045 --> 00:28:52,178
There's a little bit extra.
You can keep some for yourself.

513
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,515
- It's real good fun, bro.
- The whole thing?

514
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:56,816
- Yah.
- Just up the...

515
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,550
Yah, just up.

516
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,053
Thanks, man.

517
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:10,530
Here's hoping he chews

518
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,265
his own tongue off.

519
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:14,467
Ah!

520
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:20,440
I lied.

521
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,475
It's all in the wrist.

522
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:34,353
Now, what was this about a party?

523
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,592
[guests chatting]

524
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,998
We have an agreement?

525
00:30:12,337 --> 00:30:13,570
How could I say no?

526
00:30:13,572 --> 00:30:16,673
But let's not let
curiosity kill this cat.

527
00:30:17,075 --> 00:30:18,174
Tell me why, Ward.

528
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:20,677
For my family.

529
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,581
I walk across with you and my
girls are free from this curse.

530
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,750
Daddy said we're supposed
to hide the letter.

531
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:29,986
I did. Willa, I swear.

532
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:03,753
The Lead.

533
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:13,663
- [Nicole] You are a vision.
- Oh please,

534
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:14,998
I didn't even have time to accessorize.

535
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,800
See, I knew I wore this bracelet

536
00:31:17,802 --> 00:31:20,837
- for a reason.
- Thanks.

537
00:31:21,373 --> 00:31:24,907
Hey, if we get out of here, we are
getting dressed up way more often.

538
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:27,110
What do you mean,
"if we get out of here?"

539
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:29,679
Um...

540
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:31,114
Just stay by the exits, OK?

541
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:35,918
- Willa.
- Hey, come.

542
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:50,133
- I saw all that, you know.
- Not now, Champ.

543
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:54,203
So you two are, like, together
now, eh? That's disgusting.

544
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:55,672
[loud voice] Disgusting.

545
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,943
[Waverly] OK, so I've counted

546
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:02,912
thirteen vents in this room alone.

547
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:06,883
And how would Bobo use those to
further his nefarious plan?

548
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:10,119
- AC us to death?
- I'm being serious.

549
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:13,222
So am I. Just, it all seems so harmless.

550
00:32:13,224 --> 00:32:15,925
How could a party with
so much bubbly be bad?

551
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:16,993
- Champagne?
- Thank you.

552
00:32:16,995 --> 00:32:20,196
- Can't we celebrate a little?
- Celebrate what?

553
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:23,933
Being out. I'm sure you haven't
been out in a while,

554
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:26,269
and I haven't been out... ever.

555
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,972
Oh, God. I keep forgetting.

556
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:32,942
Am I, like, the most
insensitive sister ever?

557
00:32:32,944 --> 00:32:34,177
It's a tie.

558
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,966
I'm kidding!

559
00:32:38,183 --> 00:32:39,849
It is kinda fun, though, right?

560
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:44,787
Anything can turn bad
if revenants come around.

561
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:48,124
I don't feel safe
without Peacemaker here.

562
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,861
- Wynonna's still coming, right?
- Yeah, of course.

563
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:57,867
- Dammit!
- You in there somewhere?

564
00:32:57,869 --> 00:32:59,869
- Freezing.
- OK.

565
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:01,337
Of all the days not to wear a bra.

566
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:04,807
- I feel like a walking umlaut.
- All for the cause.

567
00:33:06,044 --> 00:33:07,276
- Security?
- No.

568
00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:10,012
- Metal detectors?
- Nada.

569
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:12,849
Well, why did I just
climb through the window?

570
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:15,613
- What the hell is Bobo playing at?
- Is that...?

571
00:33:15,987 --> 00:33:18,988
Yeah. One bullet with Bobo's name on it.

572
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,057
- Should he choose to show.
- [Willa] Oh, he'll show.

573
00:33:21,259 --> 00:33:23,993
I can feel it. We'll be ready.

574
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:27,029
You'll be ready. You're in
the crosshairs of a revenant.

575
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:28,633
The worst revenant.

576
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:31,100
Bobo comes looking for you? Bang.

577
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:33,870
- Right between the eyes.
- Wynonna...

578
00:33:33,872 --> 00:33:35,037
Trust me.

579
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:44,781
"Dear Robert"...

580
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:50,253
Oh, holy... holy shit. Hem!

581
00:33:50,555 --> 00:33:51,954
- Wow.
- Yep.

582
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:56,826
So whose stick I gotta yank to get
a hanger and a coat check tag?

583
00:33:57,328 --> 00:34:00,229
[dramatic music]

584
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:12,842
Can I just say...

585
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,625
Damn.

586
00:34:17,115 --> 00:34:18,555
Told you I could get my own dress.

587
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,383
Yeah, you sure did. Jeez.

588
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:21,984
I also got this.

589
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:27,890
- "Dear Robert"?
- Yeah, fancy, right?

590
00:34:28,059 --> 00:34:31,828
Yeah. You know, at one time,
people used to...

591
00:34:32,297 --> 00:34:35,131
...start conversations with
something other than, "Yo, dummy."

592
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:37,300
But who's Robert Svane?

593
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:40,837
He was a close confidante of Wyatt's.

594
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:43,139
The letter's our...

595
00:34:43,141 --> 00:34:45,241
great-great-granddaddy's. Dated years

596
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:48,177
- after he was cursed.
- And he confides everything.

597
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,847
How he was cursed when
he killed the demon Clootie,

598
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:53,416
how the Ghost River Triangle
holds all revenants...

599
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:55,418
They have to cross over
with the Earp heir

600
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:59,088
and the heir has to go willingly
on the Winter Solstice.

601
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,257
So that gives us less
than twenty-four hours.

602
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,359
So the attack on the homestead...?

603
00:35:03,361 --> 00:35:06,195
- Was all a ruse.
- It went wrong so quickly.

604
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:08,064
Because Bobo reneged.

605
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,966
They were never supposed to take you.

606
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:11,267
[Dolls] Willa was just insurance.

607
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:15,071
But they underestimated Ward. They
went after his daughter, then Wynonna

608
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:18,040
grabbed Peacemaker,
and all bets were off.

609
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:21,110
[Waverly] So Bobo's gonna try again.
Cross the Ghost River Triangle

610
00:35:21,112 --> 00:35:22,879
with the heir. But, guys,
what's the Lead?

611
00:35:23,629 --> 00:35:26,240
That's just it. The heir is the Lead.

612
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:29,252
Willa was right.

613
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:31,554
He had the Lead and then he lost it...

614
00:35:31,623 --> 00:35:34,390
...lost her, to Constance.

615
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:37,326
Bobo saved Willa's life.
He's been obsessed with her

616
00:35:37,328 --> 00:35:39,262
since she arrived
in Purgatory. Guys, I'm...

617
00:35:41,299 --> 00:35:42,965
I'm not the true Earp heir.

618
00:35:45,236 --> 00:35:46,269
Willa is.

619
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:50,940
- We have to get you out of here.
- Oh, screw that.

620
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,376
I'm not going anywhere.

621
00:35:57,516 --> 00:35:59,249
- Can we get Willa out the back?
- [Willa] I told you.

622
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:02,252
I'm done running away from that maniac.

623
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:03,706
[Waverly] She's right. Running
probably won't help.

624
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,791
- Bobo could have taken her at any time.
- So why the party then?

625
00:36:06,792 --> 00:36:08,925
I don't know I've done
ten laps of this place

626
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:11,461
- and I still have no clue.
- But we have Peacemaker.

627
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:14,130
[Wynonna] Remember,

628
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:16,066
the letter says you'd have
to go willingly.

629
00:36:16,068 --> 00:36:17,935
OK, so we just sit here and wait?

630
00:36:17,937 --> 00:36:18,903
[Willa] Of course not.

631
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:21,105
We drink.

632
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,003
That's not the worst idea, right?

633
00:36:27,773 --> 00:36:28,738
Come on.

634
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:34,852
You know, as soon as we break up,

635
00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:36,854
you just swoop in and steal my girl.

636
00:36:36,856 --> 00:36:39,890
OK, lower your voice. Waverly
doesn't belong to anyone.

637
00:36:40,728 --> 00:36:42,828
Oh, yeah, blah blah blah feminism blah.

638
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,130
Champ! You're drunk. And
apparently a raging homophobe.

639
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:46,998
Oh, you think this is
because she's a girl?

640
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,101
OK, Champ, I think you've had enough.

641
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:50,836
Of course you're gonna take her side.

642
00:36:50,838 --> 00:36:54,239
You know, every time I failed that
preliminary law enforcement exam,

643
00:36:54,241 --> 00:36:58,243
she would say, "It's OK, Champ.
You have nothing to prove."

644
00:36:58,245 --> 00:37:01,747
But apparently that was a lie.
She's dating a cop.

645
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:07,819
Well, I guess that would be
their own private business.

646
00:37:08,789 --> 00:37:10,155
Come on, son, let's get you out of here.

No!

00:37:13,794 --> 00:37:16,161
Champ, are you on something
other than bubbly?

Ho! Ho, ho, ho!

Ugh. I hate champagne.

The good news is, we know Bobo's plan.

658
00:37:42,122 --> 00:37:44,256
- If he's got it right.
- He does.

659
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:45,610
Willa's the heir.

660
00:37:47,895 --> 00:37:50,362
Just because she shot Peacemaker
just like you...

661
00:37:50,364 --> 00:37:52,297
Ha, ha! Not like me at all.

662

[sighing] Back at the bikers',

663
00:37:56,837 --> 00:37:58,236
there was this revenant.

664
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:02,761
Dolls, I tried
to shoot him at five feet.

665
00:38:03,844 --> 00:38:07,078
Peacemaker just... flickered and jammed.

666
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:09,014
Whatever our connection was...

667
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:12,350
...that gun's clearly made its choice.

668
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,053
Hey look, doesn't matter, OK?

669
00:38:15,055 --> 00:38:18,824
Except I go back to being
plain ole human. No offense.

670
00:38:20,861 --> 00:38:22,861
[sighing] I just...

671
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:27,966
I never wanted this,
but after a while...

672
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:33,371
I just felt... I just felt like it fit.

673
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:36,241
Like I was meant to be.

674
00:38:38,212 --> 00:38:39,911
But I'm not... I'm not special.

675
00:38:39,913 --> 00:38:41,213
- I'm just some girl.
- Hey.

676
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:44,282
You were never 'just' anything.

Guess I can go back to
bumming around Europe, huh?

If you think you're going somewhere,
you're in for a whole lot of hurt.

00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:54,125
Forget the gun.

681

You're one helluva deputy.

And Black Badge needs you.

Ahem!

Wynonna, did you drink any of this?

00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:40,672
- What?
- Did you?

No, why? What's going on?

I'm too late. Goddamn it.

We got to stop all these people
from drinking the champagne now.

Is everyone having a good time?

Well, I hope so, because
I'm only gonna say this once.

Maybe twice. I haven't decided yet.

The good news...

700
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:07,933
...is there's an antidote.
