[ Gasps ]

314
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,690
You saw those falls this morning.
Didn't you know the kid could get swept over 'em?

315
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:18,125
Sure, but I---

316
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,460
Stop this!
Billy didn't drown.

317
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,935
And it'll be daylight before you get back
if you don't hurry.

318
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,700
- And they'll find you're gone.
- [ Clint ] Dawn's almost breaking.

319
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:32,901
- Aren't you gonna lick me?
- I'm too glad to have you back.

320
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,562
[ Screams ]

321
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,088
[ Crying ]
Oh, dear God.

322
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:11,431
The wagon where Mr. Todd
was tied--- it's gone.

323
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,976
Mr. Todd!
Under that wheel.

324
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,451
You can lower me down on the rope.

325
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:47,473
- Ready?
- Yeah.

326
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,512
Can you move any, Mr. Todd?

327
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,514
[ Groans ]
Not much.

328
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:29,108
I'm caught between these rocks.
That's what saved me.

329
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,620
Ah, anybody left alive up there?

330
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,190
Just us that went swimmin'.
Oh, it's real terrible.

331
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,193
- Uh-huh.
- Are ya hurt?

332
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,025
No, I don't think so.
How'd you get down here?

333
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,929
The rope.
How can I help ya?

334
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,969
Can you move the wagon bed
that's pinnin' this wheel down?

335
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,970
I'll see.

336
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:55,037
I'm afraid if I do that, the whole thing
will go down and take you with it.

337
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,580
Well, let's try it.
Go ahead. Shove.

338
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,344
- Shall I get on the wheel?
- Yeah, sure. Go on. Go on.

339
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,557
Billy! Billy!

340
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:21,001
[ Billy ]
We're all right.

341
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,005
They found somebody.

342
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,709
[ Grunting ]

343
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:31,037
Can't budge it.
What'll I do?

344
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,049
Well, you got a safe place
to roost there?

345
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,780
- Sure. There's a wide ledge.
- All right. Then tie the rope around the rim...

346
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,788
have 'em hoist me up,
wheel and all.

347
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,165
Jenny!

348
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,360
Dally the rope to the saddle.

349
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,300
- Are you ready?
- Ah, go ahead.

350
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,243
Start haulin', Sis.
Easy.

351
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:16,189
Okay. Haul away.

352
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,553
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Exhales ]

353
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,722
Thanks.
Throw the rope back for Billy, will ya?

354
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,522
- Haul away, Sis.
- Giddap.

355
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,546
- Are you all right, Mr. Todd?
- Yeah, I guess so.

356
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,174
How can we get you
loose of that wheel?

357
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,412
Well, let's see.

358
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,149
Maybe if you loop the rope
through the spokes...

359
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,657
your sis could give 'em a yank,
bust 'em loose, huh?

360
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,660
All right.

361
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,995
- Who says we're gonna turn him loose?
- Yes. I left him on guard.

362
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,697
Maybe he better first tell us
why he didn't warn our folks.

363
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:11,036
I did.

364
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:14,737
But before they was full awake,
the Apaches swarmed 'em.

365
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,745
Nobody had a chance.

366
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:20,510
How was it they killed our people
and left you alive?

367
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,280
They didn't think they did.

368
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,287
[ Ridge ]
I'll tell you why.

369
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:29,189
Because they weren't Apaches---
they were his own Comanches.

370
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:32,319
And he didn't warn anybody.
That's why he's alive.

371
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,299
If they was Comanches, you think
my own people would shove me over that cliff?

372
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:41,132
You've got no right to be living
when all our people are dead.

373
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,002
- You've got no right to be alive!
- Stop it, Valinda.

374
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,440
I won't stop it.
Sure, you're on his side.

375
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,444
You're nothing but an Indian yourself.

376
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,743
You haven't got any feelings.
You haven't even cried.

377
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,215
You don't care if our father's dead.

378
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,714
Come on, Val.

379
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:03,192
That gal's kinda quick-sprung,
ain't she?

380
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,855
Now,Jenny, if you'll just
take the slack out of that rope.

381
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,768
No, we don't!

382
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:19,475
Say, uh, while he's nursin' that rope...

383
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,637
if you'll just take that gun
and hold it against these spokes...

384
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,907
you can, uh, sort ofblow me loose.

385
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,915
You do and he'll kill us all.

386
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,713
I got nothing against you folks.

387
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,414
Do you think he can survive
with that wheel chained to his back?

388
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,014
I don't care whether he does or not.
He's nothing to us.

389
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,389
He is to me, and toJenny.

390
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,486
I think he is to each of you.

391
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,259
And I think
we'd all best face the truth.

392
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:45,096
We're more alone now
than we've ever been in our lives.

393
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,694
If we can get Mr. Todd to lead us,
maybe we'll survive.

394
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:52,401
- If he doesn't, we won't.
- Lead us? Him?

395
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,412
- We'll find our own way.
We'll get our father's maps.
- They're burned black.

396
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,880
All we gotta do is follow this rim road
west a hundred miles.

397
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:03,215
You do that and the Apaches
will see you from 50 miles off.

398
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,448
We can always turn back the way we came---
back over the water crossing.

399
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:09,583
Can you?
Take a look.

400
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:17,634
You got just one way outta here---

401
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:20,795
through the canyon of death.

402
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:24,204
So, uh, if you'll just shoot me loose---

403
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,906
We're not turnin' this killer loose!

404
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:32,107
Stand clear, all of you!

405
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,207
Tell her to stop or I'll kill you.

406
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,945
I mean it.

407
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,788
Well, sonny, I tell you what I think.

408
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,324
You might shoot a man...

409
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,326
if you was scared enough.

410
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,659
But you ain't
quite scared enough right now.

411
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,600
Not yet.

412
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,865

[ Exhales ]

416
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,450
Well, now...

417
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:12,955
since you're in charge here,
any of them water barrels still whole?

418
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:16,720
'Cause there just ain't no water
where we're goin'. None at all.

00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,122
How about food?
Any left unburnt?

420

- I don't know.
- If you were anything but a savage...

you'd know our first thoughts
and duties were to our dead.

Your first duty is to yourself,
presumin' you want to live.

423
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,705
Our first duty's to our folks.
We're gonna bury 'em.

424

- [ Todd ] I don't think you ought to.
- I don't care what you think.

00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:42,716
Are you suggesting we leave our people
to the coyotes and the wolves?

- Billy.
- Yes?

00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:59,832
- One of them horses yours?
- The bay.

Go get him, will ya?

431
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:06,409
You and your brother helped me,
and I feel bound.

432
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,206
These here people are gonna die soon.

433
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,281
If you want, you and Billy
can start west with me.

434
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,748
Maybe I can walk us through the canyon.

435
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,843
- We heard that was taboo to whites.
- That's why we'll take it.

436
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:20,412
We might get through---
you and me and the boy.

437
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:22,492
What of the others?

438
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:27,227
Fools just gotta get theirselves killed.

439
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,732
They'll dig them graves.

440
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,603
The first party of Apache
comes by will read the signs...

441

and know somebody
lived through the fight.

442

And Apache are all mighty good trackers.

443

They won't live long.

Mr. Todd...

445
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,552
may I go with you?

446
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,655
All right.

447

You show a sight more promise
than these others. You can come.

448
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,028
Mr. Todd knows Indians.

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,657
And he knows the country.
Can't you see he's your only chance?

I don't want 'em along.

and sister were awful close.

Well, death's a path we're all on, son.

456
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,482
The Indians say a warrior dies well...

457

if he gives his life for his loved ones.

458

Let's say your folks got
a chance now to do that for you.

All right. I'll go along too.

And his bracelets stay on.

Startin' now, we turn into scavengers.

466
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:27,984
Look for water barrels.

467
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,576
Maybe the Apaches
left more than this one.

468
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:35,058
We're gonna need
every drop of water we can get.

469
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:41,793
And you're gonna have to piece together

Look for something to kill with.

a lot of tribes.

So for the next two days they'll be gatherin',
working up to bust loose.

487

Means we got two days and nights

You better take a look.

The Indians say you can hear
cries in the night down there...

496

that you'll hear all your life.

Usually it's only the wind.

498
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:41,940
Now, if anything happens to me,
you just keep due west.

499
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:46,846
It'll be eight or 1 0 days till water,
if you live to see it.

And I ain't sayin' any of us will.

You drive us two days and nights
to get away from Apaches.

Now you tell us
we roost here all day. Why?

505
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,421
Dust.
Five miles of it.

506
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:12,491
Cross it now, and every Apache for 50 miles
will see our dust plumes.

507
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,628
So starting now,
we hide out by day, travel by dark.

You see, you can do
without no food nor sleep...

can't you?

We were thinkin'
of our folks back there.

I, uh--- I know it sounds kind of
foolish to most whites...

517

but, uh, Indians don't suffer
when somebody gets killed--- not like you.

518
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,487
You see, uh, Indians

and that's a good place.

Game's never short,
and winter's never too hard.

Plenty of water.
Plenty of grass.

It's good I can keep thinking
they went to the High Ground.

if she could think that way. It does me.

we're doing it by daylight in these woods.

with secret buckets of water hanging on them too.

like that. I don't have an Indian stomach.

Whether I like it or not, I am at present

My name is Howard.
I've been known as Bible-reading Howard.

938
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:27,765
But don't hold that against me. It's just
that I rely on the good book for guidance.

939
01:32:27,875 --> 01:32:30,571
Since you're here
accused ofkilling four men...

940
01:32:30,678 --> 01:32:33,078
it is apparent you do not.

941
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:36,547
Four brothers.
Harpers, all of them.

942
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:39,887
Did you, or did you not,
kill these men?

943
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:41,548
Did you, or did you not,
kill these men?

944
01:32:41,656 --> 01:32:43,556
I killed 'em.

945
01:32:43,658 --> 01:32:45,558
In cold blood?

946
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:47,924
What's that mean?

947
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:52,591
If a man kills another man in hot anger,
perhaps even temporary insanity---

948
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,600
in hot blood, that is---

949
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:58,160
the law calls it second-degree murder,
or even manslaughter.

950
01:32:58,272 --> 01:33:03,642
But if a man plans to kill
and cold-bloodedly sets out to do it...

951
01:33:03,744 --> 01:33:06,372
that's murder in the first degree...

952
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,448
punishable by hanging.

953
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:12,117
It was the second way with me.

954
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:15,677
- Cold-blooded murder?
- That's right, I guess.

955
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:19,282
I wanted to kill 'em, and I did.

956
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:21,293
How many men you killed?

957
01:33:21,395 --> 01:33:23,295
- You mean, on the battlefield?
- Anyplace.

958
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:25,831
- How many?
- Why do you ask?

959
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:29,266
Man hangs me, I wanna know
if he knows the meaning of hangin'.

960
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:32,533
There's a difference between war
and murder--- a great difference.

961
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,767
Tell me the difference.

962
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:37,503
In war you kill
the enemies of your people.

963
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,512
That's what I did.

964
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:43,311
Wasn't them people you killed
in the Civil War your people?

965
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:46,011
My people?
The Confederates?

966
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,612
They was Americans, wasn't they?
And they're Americans now.

967
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:52,625
And they're your friends
now it's over, ain't they?

968
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:55,821
- Of course.
- Then you killed your friends.

969
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:58,160
You see, with my people it's different.

970
01:33:58,265 --> 01:34:00,699
- We only kill our enemies.
- Your people?

971
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:02,632
The Comanches.

972
01:34:02,737 --> 01:34:04,637
But you're a white man.

973
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:07,139
I was...

974
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:10,142
until the day the Harpers
come to my lodge...

975
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:14,010
and each of'em took my wife...

976
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:16,515
and then killed her.

977
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:22,021
And when my boys went to help their mother,
the Harpers killed them too.

978
01:34:22,123 --> 01:34:26,025
Smashed their faces into pulp
with their heels.

979
01:34:26,127 --> 01:34:31,360
That's what they was doin' when I heard
the screamin' from the river and run back.

980
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:33,433
Too late.

981
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:38,729
But I wasn't too late
to see them Harper faces.

982
01:34:38,839 --> 01:34:42,900
Even while they was pumpin' me
full of lead, I was seein' their faces.

983
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:47,174
Even as they left me for dead,
I was seein' their faces.

984
01:34:47,281 --> 01:34:49,647
And when I was---

985
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:53,982
when I was buryin' my wife and my boys,
I was seein' their faces.

986
01:34:55,990 --> 01:35:00,620
Then the anger in me
was hot-blooded, General, like you said.

987
01:35:00,728 --> 01:35:04,562
But as I tracked 'em west
it got cold.

988
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:07,225
Real cold.

989
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:10,565
And that's the way it was
when I killed 'em.

990
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:13,231
Cold-blooded.

991
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,808
And I was glad I killed 'em.

992
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:20,746
You wanna hang me for that, General,
you go right ahead...

993
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:23,715
'cause I'd do it all over again...

994
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:26,286
and I'd be glad.

995
01:35:29,323 --> 01:35:31,518
No matter how deeply provoked...

996
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:34,788
no man has the right
to take the law in his own hands.

997
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:37,989
It's the Comanche law
to avenge your people.

998
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:40,761
You're a white man.
You are bound by the white man's law.

999
01:35:40,868 --> 01:35:44,531
There was no " white man's law''
for hundreds of miles!

1000
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:48,540
And even if there was,
you show me a " white man''jury in this land...

1001
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:53,341
that'd hang four white men for killing
an Indian squaw and two Comanche boys.

1002
01:35:53,447 --> 01:35:56,780
I would. The color of the skin of the victims
makes no difference to me.

1003
01:35:56,884 --> 01:35:58,784
Murder is murder.

1004
01:35:58,886 --> 01:36:02,083
And law is law,
Comanche or white, if it's just!

1005
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:05,124
General, you say you'd have
condemned them Harpers...

1006
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:07,626
for killin' my wife and my boys, right?

1007
01:36:07,728 --> 01:36:10,822
- In due course oflaw.
- Didn't I just do what you'd
have deputized me to do?

1008
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:13,331
I didn't have to wear no star to do it.

1009
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:15,334
I wouldn't have deputized you
to murder them.

1010
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,495
All right, to hang 'em, then.
No difference.

1011
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:20,506
In that Bible there,
ain't it justice that counts?

1012
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:25,102
Everywhere on Earth people's got laws
that's maybe different from their neighbors.

1013
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:27,874
But justice don't change nowhere...

1014
01:36:27,982 --> 01:36:31,145
even in places where they give medals
for killin' Indians, like out here.

1015
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:33,152
Medals like that one you're wearin'!

1016
01:36:33,254 --> 01:36:35,620
I have no need to
tolerate abuse from you.

1017
01:36:35,723 --> 01:36:37,623
You're in no position
to challenge my motives.

1018
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:40,125
I've always done what I believed right.

1019
01:36:40,227 --> 01:36:42,457
Oh, and so has he!

1020
01:36:42,563 --> 01:36:46,090
All I've heard here is talk of killing,
of the taking of lives.

1021
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,294
I've heard no one say anything
about giving lives.

1022
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:51,303
You say he took four lives.

1023
01:36:51,405 --> 01:36:55,569
Well, isn't there anything in that Bible
about giving six lives back, and more?

1024
01:36:55,676 --> 01:36:58,907
Like these others who might be dead
if it weren't for him.

1025
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:02,176
When he could have saved himself,
he saved us.

1026
01:37:02,283 --> 01:37:05,446
When he could have gone,
and I urged him to go...

1027
01:37:05,553 --> 01:37:08,954
he chose to stay
and see us through to safety.

1028
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:13,220
Maybe this is a different kind
of an eye for an eye---

1029
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:17,024
the giving of lives
instead of the taking of lives.

1030
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:20,032
But I know any one of us is willing now...

1031
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:22,125
to give our lives for him.

1032
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:26,105
He did more for me than save my life.

1033
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:28,334
He made me grow up.

1034
01:37:31,145 --> 01:37:34,672
He gave me something
I couldn't have lived without---

1035
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:36,750
pride in myself.

1036
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,618
We want him to live, sir.

1037
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:51,064
I was moved by what you said
about the giving of lives.

1038
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:55,595
Do you love this man?

1039
01:38:00,808 --> 01:38:02,708
Of course.

1040
01:38:05,246 --> 01:38:06,736
Yes, son?

You've spoken well for the Indian...

and through your subsequent actions
have helped your fellow whites.

1047

And as an alternate
to hanging this man...

1048
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:33,772
would you both agree...

1049
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:36,934
to take him into custody for
as long as you both shall live?

1050
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:41,245
Oh, yes, I do.

- Me too.
