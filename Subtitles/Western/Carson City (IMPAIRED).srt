why isn't he still with you?

- $20.
- Got enough for one more?

138
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:39,519
Sure, but Mr. Crocker
told me to be sure...

The fact is I may not
be ready to start.

148

Don't be a fool. When I
recommend a man for a tough job,

It wouldn't work anyway.

158

Too many mountains to go around
between Carson and Virginia.

00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:50,632
- That's my business.
- What's your route?

161
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:53,169
That's the trouble. There isn't any.

162
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,019
All you have is a whole range
of granite mountains.

163
00:12:57,931 --> 00:13:00,015
There's the big one, right there.

164
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:02,623
- How do you know that country?
- I was born there.

165
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:04,709
You never told me that.

166
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,628
You never asked me. I haven't
been back in 10 years,

167
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:10,999
But I remember that baby
sticking up all by itself.

168
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:13,223
That was my first engineering job.

169
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,700
My kid brother and I swiped
a couple of pickaxes and started.

170
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:20,141
To tunnel through it. Broke the
handles before we got 2 feet in.

171
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,330
And got a licking to boot.

172
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,041
Always said I'd come back
someday and finish the job.

173
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:31,193
- How does it look?
- Just as dead as when I left.

174
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:34,147
- You had a brother here?
- Half brother.

175
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:36,546
You can look him up and meet me later.

176
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:40,369
Haven't seen him for 10 years.
I can wait till I get a shave.

177
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:43,532
As head of the family I've got
to make a good impression.

178
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,721
How do you spell "inconsequential"?

179
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,255
How do you spell "inconsequential"?

180
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:08,140
Look it up for yourself
so you'll remember it.

181
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,372
You're not fooling me.
You don't know yourself.

182
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:14,049
I wish dad would use
shorter words in his editorials,

183
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:16,447
Or else learn how
to spell the long ones.

184
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:18,567
That's the beauty
of owning your own paper.

185
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:21,382
Nobody can edit my copy.

186
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:24,023
You're not supposed to hear that.

187
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:28,334
I...N...

188
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:31,671
Hmm.

189
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:37,406
Alan!

190
00:14:37,474 --> 00:14:40,360
Look, it's Jeff!

191
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:44,809
Jeff!

192
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:48,006
Jeff!

193
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:51,099
Jeff!

194
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:04,099
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I didn't
mean to. I just got so excited.

195
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:06,184
That's all right. I'm afraid I don't...

196
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,721
Susan Mitchell. Don't you remember me?

197
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,919
No. Why, I can't believe it.

198
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:15,116
What do you expect me to do,
stay 13 all my life?

199
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:16,159
Hello, Jeff.

200
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:18,244
- Alan.
- Welcome home.

201
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:20,330
Say, you filled out.

202
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,624
Well, people change in 10 years.

203
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:24,813
You haven't. I knew you right away.

204
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:29,124
I had such a crush on you. I was
always trying to impress you.

205
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:31,487
Give me your coat.
I'll get the stain off.

206
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:34,685
There's plenty of time. I'm
going to be around for a while.

207
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:36,805
Wonderful. Will you have
dinner with us tonight?

208
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:40,594
Soon as I get cleaned up.
See you later.

209
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:46,919
So you've still got a crush on him.

210
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,178
Don't be silly. That was kid stuff.

211
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,395
Good.

212
00:15:50,464 --> 00:15:52,481
That was quite a reception.

213
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,400
That was my brother
and a girl I used to know.

214
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:56,825
Used to?

215
00:15:56,894 --> 00:16:00,474
She was 13 when I left.
Wore pigtails down to here.

216
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:02,525
She doesn't anymore.

217
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,959
I'm not asking anybody
to put up any money.

218
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,567
I just wanted you to know
what was going on.

219
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:18,687
In other words, you hope we like it,

220
00:16:18,757 --> 00:16:21,815
Whether we like it or not. Is that it?

221
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:24,630
- Not exactly, Zeke.
- That's what it sounds like.

222
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,890
In the first place
it doesn't affect you.

223
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,844
You wanted to get the story
firsthand for your paper.

224
00:16:29,914 --> 00:16:32,242
Anything that happens to this
town, that's my business.

225
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:34,328
Afraid you're all ahead of me.

226
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:36,413
- Hello, Davis.
- Hello, big guy.

227
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:39,054
Sorry I'm late.
Got held up at the mine.

228
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,210
What's this all about?

229
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,816
I'm going to put in a railroad
to Virginia city.

230
00:16:43,886 --> 00:16:46,284
I was just telling him I'm against it.

231
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:48,370
I'm tired of these
so-called champagne bandits.

232
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:52,088
I want my gold to go through,
I'm going to see that it does.

233
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:55,703
Perhaps if you increased
the reward money.

234
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:58,380
I personally offered to put up $5,000.

235
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,091
That didn't do it.
This is the only solution.

236
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,558
I'm surprised you aren't
in favor of it.

237
00:17:03,628 --> 00:17:06,826
- It'll bring in more people.
- What kind of people?

238
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,084
Roughnecks, thugs, claim jumpers.

239
00:17:09,224 --> 00:17:11,344
That doesn't necessarily follow.

240
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:14,020
We have a peaceful town.
Should be kept that way.

241
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:16,766
Open it up, and you'll
have another dodge city,

242
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:20,694
Where a decent woman can't
step outdoors after sundown.

243
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:22,779
Is that what you want
for your families?

244
00:17:22,848 --> 00:17:24,933
That's a pretty one-sided picture.

245
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,123
What happens to my stagecoach lines?

246
00:17:27,193 --> 00:17:29,209
We can't stop the clock, Henry.

247
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:31,434
The railroad is faster and safer.

248
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:34,109
My bank has an investment to protect.

249
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,439
I have a contract with Henry dodson.

250
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:40,227
I intend to honor it,
railroad or no railroad.

251
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:45,615
And my paper's going to
fight against it.

252
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:48,013
I think you're making a mistake.

253
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:51,175
- We'll see.
- I'm with you.

254
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:57,432
Afraid I'll have to stay
with my friends.

255
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,522
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

256
00:18:06,364 --> 00:18:08,867
Now if the rest of you will stay,

257
00:18:08,936 --> 00:18:10,917
I'll go into more detail.

258
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,915
Thanks, John. I won't forget this.

259
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:17,000
What are friends for?

260
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,086
Sharon's not in San Francisco now.

261
00:18:19,154 --> 00:18:21,484
He'll find out I swing
some weight here, too.

262
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:23,812
- Thanks, Zeke.
- Anything I can do, Zeke?

263
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,462
Read the paper tomorrow.

264
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:30,590
If that deal goes through,
we'll be out of business.

265
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,745
- It won't.
- What are you going to do?

266
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:35,838
Never fight your own battles
when you get somebody else to.

267
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:39,487
Only thing that's going
to stop Sharon's a .45.

268
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:41,573
He's got a long way to go.

269
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:44,945
Must be a fascinating life...
New places, new people.

270
00:18:45,014 --> 00:18:47,099
Always something different
around the corner.

271
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,506
You make it sound a lot better
than it seems at the time.

272
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:53,112
You must enjoy it,
or you wouldn't do it.

273
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,719
Maybe he just hasn't
found anything better.

274
00:18:55,789 --> 00:19:00,064
I guess that's about it.
Well, I must be going.

275
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:02,948
Dad will be sorry he missed you.

276
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,034
Give him my best.

277
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,989
I'm sorry, Jeff.
Didn't come out very well.

278
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:09,621
Oh, forget it.

279
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:13,549
It'll get a lot dirtier
before I'm through.

280
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,913
- Mr. Mitchell.
- Jeff.

281
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:18,763
- Glad to see you.
- Wish I could say the same.

282
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,883
- Dad?
- Nothing personal.

283
00:19:20,953 --> 00:19:23,004
I just don't like what you're here for.

284
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:25,089
What's wrong with it?

285
00:19:25,158 --> 00:19:27,174
Lots of things.

286
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:30,511
Susan, will you take this
downstairs and set it up?

287
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,639
"Proposed railroad threat
to Carson city."

288
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,725
Why is it a threat?

289
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:39,721
This will be a different town
if you put a railroad in here.

290
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,807
It could stand a little waking up.

291
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,545
I like the way it is.

292
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:46,290
Growing pains are always
a little tough,

293
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,488
But you can't get
to be an adult without them.

294
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:52,373
Depends what you mean
by being an adult.

295
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:55,188
I don't judge a man just by his size.

296
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:57,969
You got a good point there,
Mr. Mitchell.

297
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,471
Good night, sir. Thanks for dinner.

298
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,557
Don't sound so formal.

299
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:05,233
I've got to get used
to you being grown-up.

300
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:07,666
Wait a minute. I'll walk down with you.

301
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:11,037
Good night, Susan.
Good night, Mr. Mitchell.

302
00:20:11,107 --> 00:20:13,122
Zeke: Good night, Alan.

303
00:20:13,192 --> 00:20:17,467
I don't think that was a very
nice way to greet him.

304
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:19,900
We're on different sides
of the fence, that's all.

305
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,986
- He understands.
- Well, I don't.

306
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:25,426
Look, it's late. You better
hurry up with that copy.

307
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,204
So you're a newspaper man now.

308
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:34,985
Yeah. Not much by your
standards, but I like it.

309
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:37,105
That's what they pay off on.

310
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:40,581
I thought it might be hard for
you to understand how a man.

311
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,014
Could be satisfied
to stay in one place.

312
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:46,489
You wanted to see what was on
the other side of the Mountain.

313
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,540
Both sides are pretty much alike.

314
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:52,260
The way I figure it,

315
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:54,345
You got everything you want right here.

316
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:56,778
Not much sense looking anywhere else.

317
00:20:56,847 --> 00:20:59,176
Of course, it doesn't make a man out.

318
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:01,574
To be a very dashing figure.

319
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:03,972
You're on the right track,
kid. Stay on it.

320
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:06,475
- I intent to.
- Remember, I'm on your side.

321
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,734
Come on in. I'll buy you a drink.

322
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:12,001
No, thanks. Glad to have
you back, Jeff. Goodnight.

323
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,183
Good night.

324
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:18,292
Maybe you can go
with dodson, but I can't.

325
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,586
If the railroad guarantees
delivery at cheaper rates,

326
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:22,011
I have to go along.

327
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,062
- Beer.
- Right.

328
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,149
"Champagne bandits."

329
00:21:35,219 --> 00:21:38,243
Pretty fancy title
for a bunch of holdup men.

330
00:21:38,312 --> 00:21:40,606
From what I hear, they're
a pretty fancy bunch.

331
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:52,180
You the fellow that came
to town with Sharon?

332
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,571
Yes.

333
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,099
My name's Davis.

334
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,429
At our mine owners meeting just now,

335
00:21:57,498 --> 00:22:00,174
Sharon's been telling us
about this railroad idea.

336
00:22:00,244 --> 00:22:02,260
Glad to know you. I'm Jeff Kincaid.

337
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:05,735
This is Dave Fairchild,
Ben Roberts, and Jim squires.

338
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:07,821
I understand you're the engineer.

339
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,037
That's right.

340
00:22:09,107 --> 00:22:11,193
You really think
you can put it through?

341
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:13,382
I don't see anything that can stop us.

342
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:15,502
What about the terrain?
It's pretty rugged country.

343
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:18,456
That's what makes it interesting.

344
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:20,542
Are you against it, too?

345
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:22,801
Might say for ethical reasons.

346
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:25,025
I have a contract
with the stagecoach line.

347
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:29,196
The owner's a friend. Nothing
in the book against my buying.

348
00:22:29,336 --> 00:22:31,281
A drink for the opposition, though.

349
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:34,201
Thanks, but Sharon's waiting
for me. We've some work to do.

350
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:36,878
Don't you go tell him
I tried to bribe you.

351
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:39,276
No, but I'll keep it in mind.
Goodnight, gentlemen.

352
00:22:39,346 --> 00:22:42,751
Nice fellow. We better be going.

353
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:48,105
It would make it easier for me
if you learned how to smile.

354
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:50,190
You do the smiling.

355
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,588
Being nice to guys
like this is your idea.

356
00:22:52,657 --> 00:22:55,229
Only this time, it ain't going to work.

357
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:58,358
You never believe my way will
work, but it always does.

358
00:22:58,427 --> 00:23:01,312
We've never run up against
guys like this before.

359
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,745
We'll still play it my way first.

360
00:23:40,692 --> 00:23:45,141
Set off number two.

361
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,338
I've seen hard rock in my day,
but never anything like this.

362
00:23:48,408 --> 00:23:50,459
Wait till we get
those automatic drills.

363
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,241
Look!

364
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,282
Jeff: Go back! Go back!

365
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:20,906
It's a woman!

366
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,362
Get back! Get back!

367
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,741
Yah! Back!

368
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:45,235
What?

369
00:24:51,526 --> 00:24:53,611
Well!

370
00:24:53,681 --> 00:24:57,052
If I'm not being too curious...

371
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,195
Are you all right?

372
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:19,366
I guess so. I just didn't expect
so violent a greeting.

373
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,452
We do things big out here.

374
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:24,128
I've really got the touch, haven't I?

375
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:26,874
First time I see you,
I ruin your jacket,

376
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:29,272
And then a whole Mountain
blows up on me.

377
00:25:29,342 --> 00:25:33,165
- What's the matter?
- My ankle.

378
00:25:33,234 --> 00:25:35,981
Our horses are halfway back to town.

379
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,900
All right, put your arm
around my shoulder.

380
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,432
What were you doing out here?

381
00:25:49,536 --> 00:25:51,517
Looking for news.

382
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:53,603
You nearly made some.

383
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:55,688
I might as well confess.

384
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:58,086
I didn't come out here
looking for a story.

385
00:25:58,155 --> 00:26:00,762
I came to find out why
you've been avoiding me.

386
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,847
Got the feeling
your father didn't exactly.

387
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:04,933
Have the welcome mat out for me.

388
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:06,879
I'm not talking about my father.

389
00:26:06,949 --> 00:26:08,965
I've been pretty busy.

390
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,842
You don't work at night.

391
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:13,866
I thought your evenings
would be taken up.

392
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:16,924
With Alan? We're good friends.
We've grown up together...

393
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:19,426
Do all your good friends
kiss you good night?

394
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:25,092
Why, that was just a peck
on the cheek, like this.

395
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,559
You don't call that
a real kiss, do you?

396
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:31,592
- Or do you?
- I stumbled.

397
00:26:32,496 --> 00:26:34,685
Ah, here comes the wagon.

398
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:39,899
- Next time I come...
- There won't be any next time.

399
00:26:39,968 --> 00:26:43,131
Why? Just who are you
protecting with all this?

400
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,877
Alan and me, or yourself?

401
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:47,928
Let's say everybody.

402
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:52,967
If that fuse would have been
a half-inch shorter,

403
00:26:53,037 --> 00:26:55,887
You two would have been covering
a lot of territory now.

404
00:26:55,957 --> 00:26:58,354
This is hardrock haggerty, my foreman.

405
00:26:58,355 --> 00:27:01,274
- Glad to meet you.
- Howdy, ma'am.

406
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:03,637
I'll drive her home.

407
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,723
You're a mighty lucky girl, ma'am.

408
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,808
That's a matter of opinion.

409
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:09,129
Giddyap!

410
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,534
- Think you can walk on it?
- It's all right now.

411
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:40,723
But you better see the doctor anyway.

412
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:43,191
It's already been treated.

413
00:27:53,723 --> 00:27:56,434
Giddyap! Go.

414
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:05,887
Hello, Kincaid.

415
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:08,215
Whoa.

416
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:12,179
I hear about you putting a
tunnel through the Mountain?

417
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:14,994
We aren't going to have
the privilege of being turned.

418
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:17,114
Into a bustling Metropolis
for several years, then.

419
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:20,729
Sorry to disappoint you, but
it'll only take a few months.

420
00:28:20,763 --> 00:28:22,814
We're going to use automatic drills.

421
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:24,587
Automatic drills?

422
00:28:24,656 --> 00:28:26,741
Yeah, something new.
Work by compressed air.

423
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:28,896
They'll be here in a few days.

424
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:31,156
Come out next week and take a look.

425
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:35,187
Well, I guess that does it,

426
00:28:35,327 --> 00:28:37,272
But I've started over before.

427
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:40,192
I guess I ain't too old
to start someplace else.

428
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:42,313
Looks as if your newspaper.

429
00:28:42,382 --> 00:28:44,503
Hadn't quite the influence
we thought it had.

430
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:48,499
As long as I've got ink to print
it, I'm going to keep on trying.

431
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:50,585
You can't fight an automatic drill.

432
00:28:50,655 --> 00:28:52,879
With a printing press, Zeke.

433
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:54,930
I'm afraid that's right.

434
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:12,169
All right, let's go.

435
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:36,221
Whoa.

436
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,975
- All right, get down.
- Whoa.

437
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,365
Get down.

438
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:43,450
I ain't hauling any gold or silver.

439
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,570
Nothing back there but machinery.

440
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,949
Never mind about that. Get down.

441
00:29:50,019 --> 00:29:52,000
Sure, I'll get down.

442
00:29:53,286 --> 00:29:54,399
Squires!

443
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:00,133
All right, get him back in the wagon.

444
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:02,253
Pick him up.

445
00:30:03,713 --> 00:30:06,981
Throw him up in there. Hurry up.

446
00:30:07,085 --> 00:30:09,379
Get out of the way.

447
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:20,883
All right, get them out of here!

448
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,769
Head them down that hill
and cut them loose!

449
00:30:23,803 --> 00:30:25,124
Yah!

450
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:45,283
All right, fellas. Come on, push!

451
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:47,334
Come this way.

452
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:52,095
All right, push!

453
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,598
Let's go.

454
00:31:29,911 --> 00:31:32,275
It's got to be someplace.

455
00:31:32,343 --> 00:31:35,576
A whole wagonload of drills
just can't disappear.

456
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:14,886
Kingpin.

457
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:15,964
Busted?

458
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:17,041
Yeah.

459
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:54,960
Too big a load.

460
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:57,428
That kingpin must have busted.

461
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,389
It's a good thing these things
were built rugged.

462
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:07,717
We'll be able to salvage
the most of them.

463
00:33:21,515 --> 00:33:22,628
Jeff!

464
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,528
Here he is.

465
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:29,614
Looks like he was trying to crawl.

466
00:33:29,684 --> 00:33:32,499
And trying to write something, too.

467
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:36,461
"S-o-u..."

468
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,547
"S-o-u"... South?

469
00:33:38,615 --> 00:33:43,065
Well, whatever it is, we ain't
going to find out now.

470
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:46,401
"Sharing the attitude
of your editor is a.J. Davis,

471
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:48,557
"One of Carson city's most prominent.

472
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:51,406
"And respected citizens, and
partner with Jim squires"...

473
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:54,395
I don't think he's such

00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:48,199
I forgot what it tastes like.

637
00:45:56,264 --> 00:45:58,245
I'm going to town.

638
00:46:00,816 --> 00:46:03,110
I'm going to town!
Anybody coming with me?

639
00:46:11,347 --> 00:46:12,321
Beer.

640
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:16,527
Nope, I'm not supposed to...

641
00:46:16,596 --> 00:46:18,612
Bring us some beer.

642
00:46:18,682 --> 00:46:20,106
Yeah, sure.

643
00:46:21,636 --> 00:46:24,694
And set up a bottle
of whiskey with them.

644
00:46:28,379 --> 00:46:31,750
Hey, you, have a drink.

645
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,801
No, thanks.

646
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,025
I offered to buy you a drink.

647
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:38,111
We don't want a drink.

648
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,230
Why don't you go back where you belong?

649
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,316
I like it here better. Any objections?

650
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:43,915
Come on, jeb.

651
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:46,035
Have a beer!

652
00:46:52,257 --> 00:46:55,211
Next time somebody offers
to buy you a drink...

653
00:46:55,385 --> 00:46:57,818
All right, boys, party's over.

654
00:46:57,888 --> 00:46:59,903
The party's not over for you.

655
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:06,125
Let's get back to camp.

656
00:47:06,194 --> 00:47:08,558
We signed on here to build a railroad.

657
00:47:08,628 --> 00:47:11,547
What we do after working hours
is our own business.

658
00:47:11,616 --> 00:47:14,988
I made a deal with the town.
I intend to keep it.

659
00:47:15,057 --> 00:47:17,525
We'll be back to work
tomorrow, not before.

660
00:47:21,453 --> 00:47:23,538
All right, then,

661
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:25,624
We'll do it the hard way.

662
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:15,107
Everybody, back to camp.

663
00:49:15,108 --> 00:49:17,089
Give him a hand.

664
00:49:18,236 --> 00:49:20,148
Send me the bill.

665
00:49:28,455 --> 00:49:31,062
"Railroad workers terrorize town.

666
00:49:31,131 --> 00:49:33,182
"Saloon wrecked in brawl.

667
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:35,267
"Once again, Carson city has cause.

668
00:49:35,337 --> 00:49:37,352
"To regret the presence
of the railroad.

669
00:49:37,422 --> 00:49:39,751
"As predicted by
the late owner of this paper,

670
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,114
It has brought with it
nothing but trouble."

671
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:44,581
Don't you think you're
being a little unfair?

672
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,737
I wouldn't have written it if I did.

673
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:51,012
Jeff was only trying to stop it.

674
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:53,584
You know that.

675
00:49:53,688 --> 00:49:54,800
Susan...

676
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:56,191
Yes?

677
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,589
I think it's about time
we got something settled.

678
00:49:58,658 --> 00:50:02,065
We made an agreement that you
were to run the paper. I just...

679
00:50:02,134 --> 00:50:05,506
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about you and me.

680
00:50:08,147 --> 00:50:11,519
I know I've never said
anything about it before,

681
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:13,951
But, well, I just figured.

682
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:17,531
Someday maybe you and I would...

683
00:50:17,671 --> 00:50:18,922
Well...

684
00:50:18,991 --> 00:50:21,563
Alan, don't.

685
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:25,108
Oh, I know this isn't the time
or place to ask you, but...

686
00:50:25,178 --> 00:50:29,314
It isn't that. It's just that...

687
00:50:29,384 --> 00:50:33,659
Well, I've never thought
of you that way.

688
00:50:33,729 --> 00:50:36,127
We've grown up together.

689
00:50:36,196 --> 00:50:38,212
You've always seemed more like a...

690
00:50:38,281 --> 00:50:39,706
Brother?

691
00:50:39,776 --> 00:50:42,556
I'm sorry, Alan.
I don't mean to hurt you.

692
00:50:42,696 --> 00:50:45,233
I thought you always felt
the same way about me.

693
00:50:45,303 --> 00:50:47,908
- I had no idea.
- Well, never mind.

694
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:50,412
We've always been honest
with each other.

695
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,810
You wouldn't want me
any other way, would you?

696
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:55,730
Why don't you be honest?
Why don't you tell the truth?

697
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:57,884
Didn't feel this way
before Jeff came back.

698
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:00,630
That has nothing to do with it.

699
00:51:00,699 --> 00:51:03,759
You fell all over yourself
when he came into town.

700
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,983
I wish I'd never laid eyes on him.

701
00:51:06,053 --> 00:51:08,102
That doesn't mean
I would have married you.

702
00:51:08,172 --> 00:51:09,667
I don't believe it.

703
00:51:09,806 --> 00:51:11,891
Everybody in town
knew you were my girl.

704
00:51:11,892 --> 00:51:15,610
I think you've said just about enough.

705
00:51:17,105 --> 00:51:20,302
Am I also fired from my job?

706
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:22,666
That's up to you. I need you here,

707
00:51:22,736 --> 00:51:25,551
But you don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

708
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:36,708
Where can I find Jeff Kincaid?

709
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:39,002
That tent over there.

710
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,776
Hello, Alan. Glad to see you. Sit down.

711
00:51:49,846 --> 00:51:51,862
I didn't come here to visit.

712
00:51:51,932 --> 00:51:53,913
Read that. It just came out.

713
00:51:57,875 --> 00:51:59,891
Why show it to me?

714
00:51:59,961 --> 00:52:02,567
I just wanted you
to know where I stand.

715
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:05,243
I've been getting an idea
of where you stood.

716
00:52:05,313 --> 00:52:07,328
For some time now.

717
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:09,449
It hasn't seemed to bother you any.

718
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:11,916
I'm getting paid to do a job.

719
00:52:11,986 --> 00:52:15,080
If that's the way you see it,
well, that's your job.

720
00:52:15,149 --> 00:52:18,521
Isn't it a little late
to be so tolerant?

721
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,440
You're talking about Mitchell,
I don't know more than you do.

722
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:24,533
I made that clear last time I saw you.

723
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:27,731
Yeah. It doesn't go over
any better with Susan.

724
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:29,851
Let's leave her out of it, shall we?

725
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:31,936
You've been trying to undermine me.

726
00:52:32,006 --> 00:52:34,022
Ever since you got here.

727
00:52:34,092 --> 00:52:36,247
I'm not doing but get a railroad built.

728
00:52:36,316 --> 00:52:37,602
You're a liar.

729
00:52:39,584 --> 00:52:42,642
If you weren't my brother,
I'd call you on that.

730
00:52:42,712 --> 00:52:46,013
Only a half brother,
but don't let that stop you.

731
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:48,585
I don't know what happened
between you and Susan,

732
00:52:48,655 --> 00:52:51,122
But I didn't have anything
to do with it.

733
00:52:51,192 --> 00:52:53,208
Not much. The big engineer...

734
00:52:53,277 --> 00:52:55,397
Big talk about Panama, San Francisco.

735
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:58,178
I'm just the guy
that's been here all along.

736
00:52:58,248 --> 00:53:00,993
I have enough trouble without
having to wipe your nose.

737
00:53:01,063 --> 00:53:04,191
If you're such a good man,
grow up and act like one.

738
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,241
All right, I'll start now.

739
00:53:08,848 --> 00:53:12,672
Come on. What are you waiting for?

740
00:53:12,742 --> 00:53:15,174
Get out.

741
00:53:50,835 --> 00:53:52,677
Hello, Kincaid.

742
00:53:52,746 --> 00:53:55,180
Just a minute.

743
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:02,375
That's got it. Hello, Mr. Sharon.

744
00:54:02,443 --> 00:54:04,773
I was going to send you a wire tonight.

745
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:06,858
We ought to be punching through here.

746
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:08,944
That's not all you've been
punching lately.

747
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:11,863
Davis sent this to me.

748
00:54:11,932 --> 00:54:14,262
There's enough bad feeling
against us in town already.

749
00:54:14,366 --> 00:54:16,347
Without something like this happening.

750
00:54:16,451 --> 00:54:18,432
Don't believe everything.
It wasn't that bad.

751
00:54:18,537 --> 00:54:21,108
I got you out of jail to do this job.

752
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:24,097
One more episode like this,
you'll end up back there.

753
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:26,287
It would be a relief.

754
00:54:26,357 --> 00:54:28,373
You seem to think
there's something amusing.

755
00:54:28,442 --> 00:54:31,327
About being involved
in a barroom brawl.

756
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:34,246
Better check the tunnels.
We're getting too much seepage.

757
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:36,923
Check the other one.
See if they've got it, too.

758
00:54:36,993 --> 00:54:39,008
Other one? What other one?

759
00:54:39,078 --> 00:54:41,545
We're tunneling in
from both sides. Look.

760
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:43,005
Here we are.

761
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:45,994
Here's the other one
coming in along the same axis.

762
00:54:46,064 --> 00:54:48,080
How do you know they'll meet?

763
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:50,687
Is that standard engineering practice?

764
00:54:50,756 --> 00:54:53,119
Will be someday.

765
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:55,900
My bank isn't interested
in financing experiments.

766
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:58,646
Let's understand
each other, Mr. Sharon.

767
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,148
You hired me to build this railroad.

768
00:55:01,288 --> 00:55:04,415
I either do it my way,
or get another engineer.

769
00:55:04,416 --> 00:55:07,300
I don't seem to have
very much choice now.

770
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,525
That's what I figured.

771
00:55:09,629 --> 00:55:12,931
I want to see this other tunnel.

772
00:55:13,001 --> 00:55:17,380
Hardrock, show Mr. Sharon
the other tunnel.

773
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,431
All right, Jeff.

774
00:55:26,694 --> 00:55:29,162
There's a new one started over there.

775
00:55:32,256 --> 00:55:35,384
It's coming in back here. It
started a couple of hours ago.

776
00:55:35,453 --> 00:55:38,095
We've tapped underground
water. Get some pumps.

777
00:55:38,164 --> 00:55:40,458
Is it all right to keep on drilling?

778
00:55:40,528 --> 00:55:43,169
Let's shore it up first.
Give me a hand.

779
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,567
Isn't that seepage dangerous?

780
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:47,688
No more than the rest of the job.

781
00:55:47,757 --> 00:55:49,008
I must say...

782
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:52,902
[ rumbling ]

783
00:55:52,971 --> 00:55:54,952
[ Horse neighs ]

784
00:55:59,297 --> 00:56:00,444
Come back!

785
00:56:00,514 --> 00:56:02,216
No!

786
00:56:16,259 --> 00:56:19,178
Let's get help.
Come on, get out of there!

787
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:24,322
- We're trapped.
- Shut up.

788
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:30,091
If the roof holds, we'll be all right.

789
00:56:33,498 --> 00:56:35,513
And if it doesn't,

790
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,599
There's nothing we can do
about it anyway.

791
00:56:41,944 --> 00:56:44,933
There's been a landslide
at tunnel number one!

792
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:47,366
Kincaid and his crew are trapped!

793
00:56:47,436 --> 00:56:49,451
The landslide covered the entrance!

794
00:56:49,521 --> 00:56:53,239
You've got to go in after them

Wait a minute.
This horse has gone lame.

1114
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:06,704
What are you doing?

1115
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:08,929
He can't carry me and the gold both.

1116
01:25:09,763 --> 01:25:11,049
That's right.

1117
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:14,768
There's a pass a mile or so from here.

01:25:50,046 --> 01:25:52,131

1122
01:26:38,428 --> 01:26:41,417
They make it awful tough for a fellow.

1123
01:26:41,486 --> 01:26:43,884
To try to apologize to his brother.

And it's time you live up
to your end of the bargain.

1128
01:29:09,342 --> 01:29:12,019
And put in the road
from Carson city to Reno!

1129
01:29:12,089 --> 01:29:14,381
You'll break this lamp yet, will.

1130
01:29:14,383 --> 01:29:17,267
I'll have to, to get
some action around here.

1131
01:29:17,337 --> 01:29:19,352
I'm just as anxious as you are.

1132
01:29:19,422 --> 01:29:22,272
When we get this section built,
we'll have a direct line.

1133
01:29:22,342 --> 01:29:24,810
From Virginia city to San Francisco.

01:29:28,598 --> 01:29:29,745
Come in.

I found him... I mean them.

1138
01:29:33,741 --> 01:29:36,592
I know why you sent for me,
and it's no use.

1139
01:29:36,661 --> 01:29:38,678
We just stopped in to say goodbye...

1140
01:29:38,746 --> 01:29:41,632
Who does he think's putting in
track between Carson and Reno?

1141
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:44,481
Not me. I promised Susan
a real honeymoon.

1142
01:29:44,621 --> 01:29:47,192
We're going to have one.
If you have an opening.

1143
01:29:47,262 --> 01:29:49,486
For a good office man,
that's something else.

1144
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:52,267
Not now. I wanted to
give you first crack.

1145
01:29:52,337 --> 01:29:55,743
At finishing this job, but I
guess anybody can handle it.

1146
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:57,968
As you said, there's nothing to it.

1147
01:29:58,037 --> 01:30:01,339
We'll just follow
the natural bend of the wash.

1148
01:30:01,409 --> 01:30:04,084
Do it right. Here's your best drainage.

1149
01:30:04,154 --> 01:30:06,587
It may take a little long...

1150
01:30:08,464 --> 01:30:09,923
Oh, no,

1151
01:30:09,993 --> 01:30:12,044
Not this time.

1152
01:30:12,113 --> 01:30:15,103
The train leaves in 25 minutes.

1153
01:30:15,172 --> 01:30:18,474
We're not going to be on it,
are we, honey?

1154
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:20,699
Of course not, dear.
