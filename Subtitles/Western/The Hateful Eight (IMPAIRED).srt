00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,350
I'll buy you and Major Marquis there

493
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,825
- dinner and booze.
- O.B.: Get in!

My way of saying thanks.

495
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,707
I don't drink with rebel renegades,

496
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,266
and I damn sure don't break bread with them.

- You bet I do.
- O.B.: Get up there! Hyah!

502
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,985
You wrapped yourselves up in a rebel
flag as an excuse to kill and steal.

503
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,507
And this ought to interest you, Warren.

504

- CHRIS: Anywho, I'm just trying

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,022
to let y'all know how grateful I am.

511
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,710

No, they didn't.

well, the South took my continued existence

Oh,

Major Marquis did more than bust out.

Major Marquis had a bright idea.

There was a rookie regiment
spending overnight in the camp.

579
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,943
47 men burnt to a crisp.

I'm supposed to apologize
for killing Johnny Reb?

You joined the war to keep niggers in chains.

585
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,463
I joined the war to kill

586
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,190
- white Southern crackers.
- O.B.: Ha! Get up!

587
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,348
And that means killing 'em any way I can.

588

- O.B.: Get in!
- Shoot 'em, stab 'em,

drown 'em, burn 'em,
drop a big ol' rock on their head.

white Southern crackers

- in the ground,
- O.B.: Get up!

...that's what I joined the war to do.

593
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,860
And that's what I did.

594
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,028
To answer your question, John Ruth,

595
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,071
when Major Marquis burned 47 men alive,

596
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,990
for no more reason than to give
a nigger a run for the trees,

597
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,306
that's when the South put a reward
on the head of Major Marquis.

598
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,184
- And I made them trees, Mannix.
- O.B.: Get in!

599
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,904
You best believe I ain't looked back
till I crossed the Northern line.

600
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,942
Oh, but you had a surprise waiting for
you on the Northern side, didn't you?

601
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,420
See, once they started pulling out
all them burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,

602
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,901
seems not all them boys were rebs.

603
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,425
Why, you burn up some of your
own boys, didn't you, Major?

604
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,907
How many burnt prisoners they end up finding?

605
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,420
Wasn't the final Yankee death
count something like 37?

606
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,905
- O.B.: Giddyup!
- (REINS CRACKING)

607
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,704
That's the thing about war, Mannix.

608
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,265
People die.

609
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,711
Oh.

610
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,903
So you gonna chalk it up
to "war is hell," huh?

611
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,461
Well, admittedly, that is
a hard argument to argue with.

612
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,469
But if memory serves,

613
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,948
your side didn't look at it that way.

614
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,461
I think they thought 37 white men

615
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,947
for one nigger

616
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,222
wasn't so hot a trade.

617
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,628
- I do believe they accused you
- O.B.: Giddyup!

618
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,026
...of being a kill-crazy nigger

619
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,222
who only joined the war to kill white folks,

620
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,147
and the whole blue and gray of it all
really didn't matter that much to you.

621
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,705
O.B.: Ha! Get up!

622
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,822
And that's why they drummed your black ass

623
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,341
out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down your back.

624
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,623
- O.B.: Get in!
- Isn't it, Major?

625
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,105
Horseshit!

626
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,665
If he'd have did all that, the cavalry

627
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,191
- would've shot him.
- O.B.: Get in!

628
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,790
Well, I didn't say they could prove it.

629
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,265
- O.B.: Get up!
- But they sure did

630
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,303
think it out loud, didn't they, Major?

631
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,263
O.B.: Hyah! Get up, boys!

632
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,031
But Warren's war record was stellar,

633
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,507
and that's what saved his ass.

634
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,781
O.B.: Hyah!

635
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,709
Now, you killed yourself your share

636
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:26,109
of redskins in your day,
didn't you, Black Major?

637
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,222
Cavalry tends to look kindly on that.

638
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,230
I'll tell you what the cavalry
didn't look kindly on.

639
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,555
- O.B.: Giddyup!
- Mannix's Marauders, that's what.

640
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:34,670
O.B.: Get in! Hyah!

804
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,703
Well,

805
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,108
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.

806
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,666
I take it you're Daisy Domergue?

807
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,384
- That's her.
- Yeah.

808
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,624
(SOFTLY): I see.

809
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,707
Uh, it says here "dead or alive."

810
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,663
Yeah. It does.

811
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,828
Well, transporting a desperate,

812
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,341
hostile prisoner such as her

813
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,309
sounds like hard work.

814
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,384
Wouldn't transporting her be easier

815
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,945
if she were dead?

816
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,745
Well, no one said the job
was supposed to be easy.

817
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,386
And why is her hanging proper
so important to you?

818
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,309
Let's just say I don't like
cheatin' the hangman.

819
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,104
He got to make a living, too.

820
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,587
Well, I appreciate that.

821
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:53,590
Allow me to properly

822
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,589
introduce myself.

823
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,141
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,
the hangman in these parts.

- Ah.

826
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,750
Looks like I brought you a customer.

827
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,986
Yeah, so it would appear.

828
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,864
You ever spent two days or more

829
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,063
locked up with one of your customers before?

830
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,182
- I can't say I have.
- Don't talk to my prisoner.

831
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,745
I talk to my prisoner, that's it.

832
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,941
- You got it?
- I got it.

833
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,266
(CHUCKLES) Jolly good.

834
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,864
You got anything in here besides
coffee that can help warm us up?

You go inside and get some hot coffee.

851
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,150
Got some stew cooking.

852
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,347
Should be done soon.

853
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,700
Now, look.

854
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,222
No matter how bad this blizzard gets,

855
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:57,186
we still got to feed these horses
and take a squat from time to time.

856
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,383
So me and Chris better lay out a line

857
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,662
from the stable to the front door

858
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,664
and from the front door to the shithouse.

859
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,310
Okay?

860
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,344
Good idea.

00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,110
Come on, Chris.

00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,265
I'll give you a hand.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Go inside. Get warm.

864
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,463
You're doin' stable work
in a goddamn blizzard.

(♪♪♪)

878
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,461
Now, you're wanted for murder.

879
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:01,788
For the sake of my analogy,
let's just assume that you did it.

880
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,028
Now, John Ruth wants
to take you back to Red Rock

881
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,063
to stand trial for murder.

882
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,309
And if you're found guilty,

883
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,063
the people of Red Rock
will hang you in the town square.

884
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,989
And, as the hangman,

885
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,309
I will perform the execution.

886
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,026
And if all those things

887
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,983
end up taking place,

888
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,104
that's what civilized society

889
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,542
calls justice.

890
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,549
However,

891
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,823
if the relatives and the loved ones

892
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,390
of the person you murdered
were outside that door right now,

893
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,821
and after busting down that door,

894
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,386
they drug you out into the snow

895
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,548
and hung you up by the neck,

896
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,028
that would be frontier justice.

897
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,064
Now, the good part

898
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,909
about frontier justice

899
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:57,661
is it's very thirst-quenching.

900
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:02,229
The bad part is
it's apt to be wrong as right.

901
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,671
Well, not in your case.

902
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,111
In your case, you'd have it coming.

903
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,383
But other people, maybe not so much.

904
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,510
OSWALDO: But ultimately, what's
the real difference between the two?

905
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,261
The real difference is me.

906
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,870
The hangman.

907
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,744
To me, it doesn't matter what you did.

908
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,101
When I hang you, I'll get no
satisfaction from your death.

909
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,301
It's my job.

910
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,865
I hang you in Red Rock.

911
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,704
I move on to the next town.

912
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:30,666
I hang someone else there.

913
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:34,910
The man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck

914
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,910
will be a dispassionate man.

915
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:42,309
And that dispassion
is the very essence of justice.

916
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,220
For justice delivered without dispassion

917
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,982
is always in danger of not being justice.

why don't you tell me
the story that brings you here?

Who's asking?

I am. John Ruth.

938
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,661
I'm bringing in this one to Red Rock to hang.

939
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,982
And ain't no way I'm spending
a couple of nights

940
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,387
under a roof with somebody
I don't know who they are,

941
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,025
and I don't know who you are.

942
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,108
So, who are you?

943
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,109
Joe Gage.

944
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,188

- That's my name.

Okay, Joe Gage.

947
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,269
Why you going to Red Rock?

948
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,422
I ain't, I ain't, I ain't going to Red Rock.

949
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,985
Where you going?

950
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,023
About nine miles outside of Red Rock.

951
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,227
What's there?

952
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,671
My mother.

953
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,066
Your mother?

954

Listen, I'm just a cowpuncher.

955
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:33,390
I just, uh, got back
from a long drive, and...

956
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,028
and I wasn't just an ass
in a saddle this time.

957
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,507
I was a partner.

958
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,420
First time in my life I made a pretty penny.

959
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,110
And, uh,

960
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:50,424
figured I'd come home
and spend time with my mother

961
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,264
for Christmas.

962
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,905

(PANTING)

1937
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,863
Everybody keep your mouths shut.

1938
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:52,590
Do like I say.

1939
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:56,582
You open your mouth, you gonna get a bullet.

1940
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:59,425
Move a little sudden, a little strange,

1941
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:01,781
you gonna get a bullet.

1942
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:04,141
Not a warnin', not a question.

1943
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:05,989
A bullet.

1944
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,421
You got that?

1945
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:09,991
Let me hear you say, "I got it!"

1946
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:11,386
- I got it.
- I got it.

1947
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:12,621
I got it.

1948
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:14,424
We have it.

1949
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:17,902
Chris Mannix, come over here on this side.

1950
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:20,905
Come on.

1951
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:28,148
Take this gun out my holster.

1952
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,943
(WHISPERING): Point it at them.

1953
01:47:42,340 --> 01:47:44,263
Now, like I said,

1954
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:47,145
anybody does anything,

1955
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:49,581
and I mean anything,

1956
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:51,384
you kill 'em.

1957
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:55,061
(GUN CLICKS)

1958
01:47:55,180 --> 01:47:56,944
So...

1959
01:47:57,060 --> 01:47:58,949
you finally decided I'm tellin' the truth

1960
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:01,108
about bein' the sheriff of Red Rock, huh?

1961
01:48:02,780 --> 01:48:04,942
I don't know about all that.

1962
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:07,540
But I know you ain't the killer
poisoned that coffee,

1963
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:10,186
'cause you almost drunk it
your own damn self.

1964
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:11,870
One of them is.

1965
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:18,261
Aah!

1966
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,382
Ow!

1967
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:23,310
Give me the key. Give me the key!

1968
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:39,060
(YELLS) You motherfucking black bastard!

1969
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:43,861
You're gonna die on this mountain,
and I'm gonna fucking laugh when you do!

1970
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:45,550
(GASPS)

1971
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:47,310
WARREN: What'd I say 'bout talkin'?

1972
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,501
(MUTTERING): Bastard.

1973
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:50,987
Meant it, didn't I?

1974
01:48:52,180 --> 01:48:56,027
And you need to understand
you just killed the only man here

1975
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:59,269
committed to gettin' you to Red Rock alive.

1976
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:07,108
Now, one of y'all...

1977
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:10,190
is workin' with her.

1978
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:12,348
Or two of y'all is workin' with her.

1979
01:49:12,460 --> 01:49:15,111
Or all y'all is.

1980
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:21,105
But only one of you poisoned the coffee.

1981
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:27,625
Now, what charms this bitch got

1982
01:49:27,740 --> 01:49:30,425
make a man brave a blizzard,

1983
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,383
kill in cold blood?

1984
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:34,104
(CHUCKLES)

1985
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:36,222
I'm sure I don't know.

1986
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:43,422
But John Ruth's tryin' to hang your woman.

1987
01:49:43,540 --> 01:49:45,349
So you kill him.

1988
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:47,269
Okay.

1989
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:49,382
Maybe.

1990
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,663
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.

1991
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:54,145
He damn sure wasn't.

1992
01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:56,986
But he sure enough layin' over there
dead now, though, ain't he?

1993
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:59,182
He damn sure is, you sons of bitches.

1994
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,065
Just like any one of us
would've drunk that coffee.

1995
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:04,308
Like me, goddamn it.

1996
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:07,390
Now, those of y'all
with your hands on the wall

1997
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:10,549
don't practice in poison
need to think about that.

1998
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:16,625
Think about how it could've been you
rollin' around here on this floor.

1999
01:50:16,740 --> 01:50:20,790
And how the man standin' next
to you would be responsible.

2000
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:23,386
And I know who I got my money on.

2001
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,867
Oh, that's right, Joe Gage.

2002
01:50:25,980 --> 01:50:27,345
I'm lookin' at you.

2003
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:31,741
Not so fast, Chris.

2004
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:34,022
We'll get there.

2005
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:37,144
Let's slow it down.

2006
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:39,706
Let's slow it way down.

2007
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:43,185
(GUN CLICKS)

2008
01:50:45,220 --> 01:50:46,984
Who made the coffee?

2009
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:48,704
He did.

2010
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:52,230
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

2011
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:55,389
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

2012
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:58,709
But it's the stew that's got me thinkin'.

2013
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:03,064
Now, how long you said Minnie been gone?

2014
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:04,750
A week?

2015
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:07,345
Si.

2016
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:10,070
See...

2017
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:13,150
my mama used to make stew,

2018
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:16,825
and it always tasted the same,
no matter the meat.

2019
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:18,863
And there was another fellow
on the plantation,

2020
01:51:18,980 --> 01:51:20,505
Uncle Charly.

2021
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:22,145
He made stew, too.

2022
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:23,944
And like my mama,

2023
01:51:24,060 --> 01:51:27,951
I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper

2024
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:30,461
till I was a full-grown man.

2025
01:51:31,660 --> 01:51:33,583
No matter the meat,

2026
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:36,544
it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.

2027
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:41,463
Now, I ain't had Minnie's stew
in six months, so I ain't no expert.

2028
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:45,665
But that damn sure is...

2029
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:48,465
Minnie's stew.

2030
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:50,947
So if Minnie is on the north side

2031
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:53,540
visitin' her mama for a week,

2032
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:56,510
how'd she make the stew this mornin'?

2033
01:51:56,660 --> 01:51:58,185
CHRIS: Hmm. (CHUCKLES)

(BOB SIGHS)

2035
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:03,710
And this...

2036
01:52:03,820 --> 01:52:07,620
this is Sweet Dave's chair.

2037
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:09,788
When I sat in it earlier,

2038
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:11,709
(CHUCKLING): I couldn't believe it.

2039
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:14,346
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chair.

2040
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:16,701
Uh, this may be Minnie's place,

2041
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:20,108
but this is damn sure

2042
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:22,302
Sweet Dave's chair.

2043
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:27,783
And if he went to the north side...

2044
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:31,781
I'm pretty goddamn sure

2045
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:34,585
this chair be goin' with him.

2046
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:41,063
What's in the chair?

2047
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:43,342
Just what I thought.

2048
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:46,470
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.

2049
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:48,230
Hoo!

2050
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:50,064
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

2051
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:56,504
So, are you actually accusing me of murder?

(WARREN CHUCKLES)

2053
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:02,670
Way I see it, Senor Bob,

2054
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:05,943
is whoever is workin' with her

2055
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:08,904
ain't who they say they is.

2056
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:10,863
And if it's you,

2057
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:13,108
that means Minnie and her man

2058
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:15,063
ain't at her mama's.

2059
01:53:15,180 --> 01:53:18,662
They layin' out back there dead somewhere.

2060

the real Oswaldo Mobray layin'
in a ditch somewhere

2062
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:26,786
and you just a English fella
passin' off his papers.

2063
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:29,665
CHRIS: Or we go by my theory,

2064
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:32,704
which is the ugliest guy did it.

2065
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:35,391
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.

2066
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:39,789
So I take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned

2067
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:41,868
while you were murdering the old man?

2068
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:44,710
Yes.

2069
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:47,346
Well, mi negro amigo,

2070
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:49,622
during that whole incident,

2071
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:52,346
I was sitting on that side of the room

2072
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:54,667
playing "Silent Night" on the piano.

2073
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:57,824
Oh, I ain't say you poisoned the coffee.

2074
01:53:57,940 --> 01:54:00,910
I said you didn't make the stew.

2075
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:05,902
My theory is...

2076
01:54:06,020 --> 01:54:09,024
you workin' with the man

2077
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:13,341
who poisoned the coffee,
and both of y'all murdered Minnie,

2078
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:16,384
Sweet Dave and whoever else
picked this bad-luck day

2079
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,344
to visit Minnie's Haberdashery this mornin'.

2080
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:23,226
And at some point, y'all intended

2081
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:25,820
to bushwhack John Ruth

2082
01:54:25,940 --> 01:54:28,705
and free Daisy.

2083
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,266
But you didn't count on the blizzard,

2084
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:34,429
and you didn't count on the two of us.

2086

- ain't you?
- (LAUGHS)

2090

2091
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:55,181
based on a far-fetched nigger theory,

2092

01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:07,265
And it's a little bit more than a theory.

2096
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:14,191
How long you say you been workin' for Minnie?

2097
01:55:14,300 --> 01:55:16,064
Four months.

2098
01:55:16,180 --> 01:55:17,909
Mmm.

2099
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:20,705
See, if you'd have been here
two and a half years ago,

2100
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:24,666
you'd know 'bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar.

2101
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:27,226
Minnie mention that to you?

2102
01:55:28,540 --> 01:55:30,383
No.

2103
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:33,305
You want to know what
that sign said, Senor Bob?

2104
01:55:35,460 --> 01:55:39,749
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed."

(CHRIS LAUGHS)

2106
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:46,822
Now, Minnie hung that sign up
the day she opened this haberdashery.

2107
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:49,910
And it hung over that bar every day

2108
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:53,030
till she took it down
a little over two years ago.

2109
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:56,384
You know why she took it down?

2110
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:00,786
She started lettin' in dogs.

01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:10,708
but she sure don't

2114

like Mexicans.

2115
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:14,703
So when you tell me

2116
01:56:14,820 --> 01:56:18,381
Minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama,

2117
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:21,071
well, I find that highly unlikely.

2118
01:56:21,180 --> 01:56:24,468
But okay, maybe.

2119
01:56:24,580 --> 01:56:27,186
But when you tell me

2120
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:30,941
Minnie Mink took the haberdashery,

2121
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:35,025
the most precious thing to her
in the whole world,

2122
01:56:35,140 --> 01:56:39,111
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn Mexican?

2123
01:56:40,580 --> 01:56:42,230
Well, that's what I meant in the barn

2124
01:56:42,340 --> 01:56:45,071
when I said that sure
don't sound like Minnie.

2125
01:56:47,140 --> 01:56:50,144
Now I am calling you a liar,

Domingre Gang bounty money,

you still got to get
all our corpses into Red Rock.

02:28:31,260 --> 02:28:33,422
And that ain't gonna be so easy.

2707
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:35,781
'Cause I doubt you can drive
a four-horse team.

2708

And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two-horse team.

2709
02:28:38,900 --> 02:28:43,551
So that means you're gonna have to lead
a string of horses into Red Rock.

2710
02:28:43,700 --> 02:28:45,987
And with that deep snow after a blizzard,

2711
02:28:46,100 --> 02:28:48,387
you ain't gonna be able
to get away with any more than,

2712
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:50,582
say, one body per horse.

2713
02:28:50,700 --> 02:28:56,503

of four horses into Red Rock.

And with all them horses in that snow

2715
02:29:00,220 --> 02:29:03,224
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.

And you're gonna run smack dab
into the Domingre Gang.

kill you and that nigger!
