- Wouldn't dream of it. (Crunches)

157
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:32,808
How can I be
of service to you?

158
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,582
(Glass thuds) I understand
your Senate committee

159
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,385
investigated the man
that was murdered last night.

160
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:39,318
(Clicks pen) Yeah. God, that
was horrible, wasn't it?

161
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:42,021
- Who was he?
- He was a bad, bad man.

162
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,792
He was corrupt, and he was a bully.
Made L.B.J. to look like a pussycat.

163
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,126
How so?

164
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,029
Well, he owned
water parks across the state.

165
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,200
A couple of years back,
he and his partner, Kirk Denby,

166
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:55,028
had this really bad falling out.

167
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:58,037
So they split the company in half.
Each of them got six parts.

168
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:01,640
- Why investigate Reed?
- 'Cause, uh... (Chuckles)

169
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,462
He was trying to bribe
the Water Commission.

170
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:08,109
That last drought we had... when all the
restrictions got put into place... well...

171
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,147
Reed's parks got water.

172
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:13,519
- And the partner's didn't?
- Bone dry. Lost everything.

173
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:17,222
Ever try going down
a water slide with no water in it?

174
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:19,591
Your ass heats up
pretty quick.

175
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:26,587
Give my love
to your family.

176
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:29,884
- You really just said that?
- And I really did mean it.

177
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:35,182
(Clatter)

178
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:39,725
You were right. We need to speak
to Reed's ex-partner.

179
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,790
(Mouth full) Austin P.D. just called.
(Telephone rings)

180
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:45,869
I know exactly
where to find him.

181
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,953
Whoo-hoo! That son of a bitch
is dead!

182
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:50,421
He's dead! Dead!

183
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:53,378
Denby! You need
to come on down now!

184
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:56,778
Hey, look who's on top
of the world now, huh?!

185
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,821
Takin' it pretty hard,
isn't he?

186
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:02,547
You need a little more
water for your slide?!

187
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:06,171
Denby! Get the hell <i>off</i>
<i>the top of the world!</i> Now!

188
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:13,377
(Thuds)

189
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:15,986
Maybe killing him
wasn't enough.

190
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:28,700
He was a right son of a bitch,
and I got nothing nice to say,

191
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:31,179
even if it lands me in jail.

192
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,488
Where were you last night,
Mr. Denby?

193
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:37,458
At home by myself.
Got nobody to go out with now.

194
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,572
I've got the stink of broke
all over me.

195
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,465
All because of Clete Reed,
isn't that right?

196
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:45,369
Oh, but now the good Lord
has noticed his despicable ways.

197
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,149
Well, sweet justice was served.

198
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,761
With a little help from you.

199
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:53,683
If the good Lord needs my help,
we're in worse shape than I thought.

200
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:56,623
We think Mr. Reed was killed
by a professional assassin.

201
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,091
Maybe one you hired.

202
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,981
How does a broke man
hire an assassin?

203
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:03,709
There's lots of people who might
have wanted Clete dead,

204
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,783
from people he did business with
to that sweet little wife of his.

205
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:07,940
His wife?

206
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:11,578
Yeah, have you seen the poor lady?
Stitched up like Frankenstein.

207
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,880
You're referring to Mrs. Reed's
plastic surgery?

208
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:18,052
Old Clete had sent her out to get
carved on every time the fancy struck.

209
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,746
Liposuction, breast enlargement,
the tummy tuck.

210
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,582
If he thought she was looking
a little fat,

211
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:26,864
he took away the car and made her
walk to the grocery store.

212
00:11:26,865 --> 00:11:31,620
Figured that adding an obstacle to eating
would keep down her dress size.

213
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:39,209
Punishment by plastic surgery...
That's a new one.

214
00:11:39,277 --> 00:11:41,476
I think Mrs. Reed
is worth a look.

215
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:45,050
You said she told you they were happy,
that her husband doted on her.

216
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,114
Except her doting husband
didn't check her in for surgery

217
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:50,389
or call to see how she was doing, and
she wasn't wearing her wedding ring.

218
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:52,725
Don't the diamonds come off
before you go under the knife?

219
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,888
She didn't want me to call her
by her husband's last name,

220
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:56,399
just her first name... Nan.

221
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,754
You know that's just
being friendly, right?

222
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:00,630
If I hated my husband enough
to have him killed,

223
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:02,892
I wouldn't want to be killed
by his last name either.

224
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:04,857
I'll remember that.

225
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:08,120
She wanted the details
of how he died,

226
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:11,837
and then she imagined it
like she wanted to live it.

227
00:12:11,838 --> 00:12:14,283
If her marriage
was that bad...

228
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:17,381
I never understand why
people don't just leave.

229
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:23,443
Because some women can't, particularly
if they blame themselves for the abuse.

230
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:26,958
(Footsteps depart)

231
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:39,845
(Man speaking indistinctly)

232
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:41,192
- Hey, bro.
- Hey.

233
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:45,994
- Aunt Molly! I got into the swim team.
- That is awesome!

234
00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:47,963
Hailee got a C-minus
in English.

235
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:50,549
That's not awesome
and also none of your business.

236
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:52,115
That's what mom said.

237
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:54,053
<i>♪</i>

238
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:58,765
Please. She's gross.
Tell me who hasn't tapped that.

239
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:01,368
- Total ho.
- Ho?

240
00:13:01,369 --> 00:13:02,469
<i>♪</i>

241
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,771
Not nice.

242
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:06,173
<i>♪</i>

243
00:13:06,174 --> 00:13:07,545
(Knock on door)

244
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:09,914
I need a blouse
for a memorial service.

245
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:13,023
(Sniffing)

246
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,092
Why are you sniffing that?

247
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:18,724
- (Hangers clack) I'm not.
- You were.

248
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:24,000
I, um... I like the smell of my husband.
Don't be such a ranger.

249
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:29,427
- And you're going through his pockets.
- I didn't do that.

250
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:31,271
You're lying.
What's going on?

251
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,998
I'm being a good housewife
and I'm doing the laundry.

252
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:36,667
Uh-huh.
In your comfort slippers?

253
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:37,935
What's got you upset?

254
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:41,304
Molly, seriously, I hate it when
you drill me like you are right now.

255
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:44,381
(Sighs) That's a diversion.
Your eyes went down,

256
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:46,355
so I know it's something
you don't wanna talk about.

257
00:13:46,356 --> 00:13:47,818
I don't wanna talk
about it.

258
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,238
You think my brother's...

259
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:52,742
Just pick a blouse from the closet
and get out of my room.

260
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:54,510
(Mouths word)

261
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:04,635
- We're gonna come back to this.
- (Whispers) Out.

262
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:09,789
(Sighs)

263
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,861
(Indistinct conversations)

264
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:17,362
(Footsteps approach)

265
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,333
Ranger Parker.
Did you arrest someone?

266
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:23,799
No, not yet.
Sorry to interrupt.

267
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,120
I was going to wait to speak to you
until after the memorial was over.

268
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:29,155
Well, now's all right.

269
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:32,646
Uh, I wanna help you
in any way that I can.

270
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:36,454
I spoke to your husband's
ex business partner, Kirk Denby.

271
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:41,905
Oh, Kirk? He's a...
he's a bankrupt alcoholic.

272
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:46,309
He said your husband abused you,
emotionally and physically.

273
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,965
Abu... well, that...

274
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:52,054
That's a terrible thing
to say about a man who's dead.

275
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:55,112
Kirk Denby... he's the one
who hated Clete.

276
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,513
He did.

277
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:59,783
But he didn't have money
to hire a professional assassin.

278
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,152
Nan, did your husband
abuse you in any way?

279
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,657
Well, we fought sometimes.
I mean, who doesn't?

280
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:09,559
I was looking
at those photos.

281
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:12,095
Your breasts got bigger
during your marriage.

282
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,004
That... that is vulgar.

283
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:18,317
How... are my breasts in any way
related to a murder investigation?

284
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,585
And now they're smaller
again.

285
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,824
You had your implants removed
the same day your husband was murdered.

286
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:25,047
(Sighs) Is that something
he would have approved of?

287
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:27,346
Clete and I discussed
the surgery.

288
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,640
I decided to have the implants
removed because they caused me pain.

289
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:34,043
You've had a lot of that
in your life, haven't you?

290
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:37,169
People snap, Nan, especially
when they feel trapped and afraid.

291
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,178
- Well, what does that have to do with me?
- I hope nothing.

292
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:57,847
I know she ordered
the hit.

293
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,850
You know it, or you got one
of those feelings in your gut?

294
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:03,535
(Sighs) He forced his wife
to have surgery, repeatedly.

295
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:07,044
She went from a 32B
to a 36E. Disgusting.

296
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,654
Well, depends on the hips, really.
(Slaps side)

297
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:14,246
According to his ex business partner,
the guy was a sadistic monster.

298
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:16,427
You see
a 7/8 wrench down there?

299
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:21,645
(Huffs) Thing is, Mrs. Reed never had more
than $400 in her account. (Tools clatter)

300
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,505
Her husband controlled
the money, too.

301
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:26,875
Well, $400 ain't buying you
a professional assassin.

302
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:30,478
- You're talking 25K at least.
- I know.

303
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,980
But maybe she secretly
squirreled away some cash.

304
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,849
What, and buried it
in the backyard?

305
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,252
If I find the money and follow it,

- Why not?

Yes. I'm originally from Connecticut,
so I'm going back.

00:17:45,385 --> 00:17:47,820
I may ask you
to stick around.

- Because I'm a suspect?
- Yes, ma'am.

329

I don't lie to people,
Nan,

330

and I'm trained to know
when people are lying to me.

331
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:00,351
So you think that
by saying that,

332
00:18:00,352 --> 00:18:04,503
you're gonna get me to confess
to a crime that I didn't commit?

333
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:07,877
I think you're lying when

I mention your husband,

336
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,121
you cross your arms or touch
some part of your body,

337
00:18:19,122 --> 00:18:22,353
maybe to reassure yourself that
it's yours and not his anymore?

338
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:25,627
I've just lost the only man
that I've ever been with.

I'm alone and... it reassures me.

I know what kind of man
your husband was, Nan.

I know he controlled your body
and how he controlled your finances

343
00:18:37,334 --> 00:18:39,924
and kept you on a very tight
budget despite his success.

You should look around.

My husband's.

349
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:56,868
He collected
native American artifacts.

- Comanche?
- Um, I'm not sure.

It's something our interior
designer helped Clete acquire.

- Who's your interior designer?
- Jennifer Jennings. Why?

- Be prettier if it were real.

359

- Come again?
- The vase is fake.

360
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:32,243
It was fired in a kiln,
not dried in the sun.

361
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:34,471
I know a fair amount
about comanche pottery.

362

I was obsessed with comanches
as a kid.

Seeing as your last name
is Parker.

364
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:41,133
Yes, ma'am. My family
goes back to Cynthia Anne

365
00:19:41,134 --> 00:19:42,737
and the first settlers
of West Texas.

Nan replaced it with a fake and
sold the original to pay for a hit man.

You're a victim of abuse,

Sat down beside me
at a juice bar

441
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:11,409
and told me he could put
an end to all my suffering.

442
00:24:11,437 --> 00:24:12,903
That was the man
at the park?

443
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:19,293
He knew all about my marriage,
the surgeries, the fits, the beatings.

- How could he know that?
- I don't know.

No name, no number...
He was just an answer to my prayers.

446
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,831
Told me it would cost me
$30,000 to have Clete killed

447
00:24:31,832 --> 00:24:35,563
and I could meet him down at a coffee
shop downtown when I was ready.

448
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:41,699
And I didn't do anything
at first.

00:24:43,408 --> 00:24:46,127

- Something happened?

Maybe almost nothing?

451

And all the pain
came pouring out?

452
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,305
I know what
that feels like, Nan.

454
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:05,521

my girl scout cookies.

of the dead bag man.

460
00:25:42,198 --> 00:25:45,475
(Rustle) No leads to who he was
working for, but they did find this.

461
00:25:45,726 --> 00:25:47,627
Frequent customer card

462
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:50,288
from the coffee shop where
he did his business with Nan Reed.

463
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:53,574
He's a regular.
Stamped nine times.

464
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:55,476
Tenth cup is free.

465
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:57,910
He had other clients.

466
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:11,250
You're for real? I thought
all rangers were dudes.

467
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:13,972
- Have you seen that man?
- Yeah. A few times.

468
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,993
He used to come in
and chat up women.

469
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:17,995
- Like this one?
- She was one.

470
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:21,189
- She was sad. Sorta shy.
- Who else?

471
00:26:21,341 --> 00:26:26,421
They all looked the same to me...
Middle-aged, defeated, desperate.

472
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:28,711
Do you know any
of their names?

473
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:30,543
One.

474
00:26:30,611 --> 00:26:32,910
She was more confident
than your girl in the picture.

475
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:36,732
- Had a lot more... Going on.
- You're a real Dr. Freud.

476
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:40,020
I understand women. Maybe
that's why they like me so much.

477
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,122
She asked me to give her
a call, but I'm taken.

478
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,157
At least until someone better
comes along.

479

Ow.

00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:09,797
Hello?

487
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:12,651
I'm Ranger Parker. I'm here
to speak to Maggie Tanner.

488
00:27:12,652 --> 00:27:15,503
You got her.
What can I do for ya?

489
00:27:15,504 --> 00:27:17,205
I'd like to speak to you
for a few minutes

490
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:19,291
about your husband's
unfortunate passing.

491
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:22,344
- My husband's right here.
- The one before.

492
00:27:22,345 --> 00:27:26,216
Bobby Dean was much older...
I think about 32 years.

493
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:28,885
- You think?
- Well, he always lied about his age.

494
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:32,561
(Ice cubes rattling) Not that I cared.
Old is old, and rich is rich.

495
00:27:32,562 --> 00:27:34,865
(Tea pouring, ice rattling)
Our marriage was contractual.

496
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:38,098
He wanted pretty on his arm.
I wanted money on my finger.

497
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:39,199
But then he died.

498
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,102
Yes, he did.
Heart stopped, I guess.

499
00:27:42,103 --> 00:27:45,006
He tipped off his fishing boat.
He had his nitro pills with him.

500
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:47,756
Just didn't get one under his tongue
before the ticker blew up.

501
00:27:47,757 --> 00:27:49,858
They never did find
Bobby Dean's body, did they?

502
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,465
- No, not yet.
- It's been three years?

503
00:27:52,466 --> 00:27:55,725
Well, it'll turn up eventually.
Won't be pretty.

504
00:27:55,726 --> 00:27:57,193
(Ice cubes rattle)

505
00:27:59,597 --> 00:28:01,004
(Tea pouring)

506
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:02,656
Do you know this man?

507
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,647
(Dog barking in distance)

508
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:08,851
Uh... nope. Don't know him.
Should I?

509
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:11,387
I have a witness who says
he met you at a coffee shop.

510
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:14,292
- The Texas Grind?
- The Texas Grind?

511
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,728
Well, now I like men,
but I gotta tell ya,

512
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:18,723
I forget them
as easily as I meet them,

513
00:28:18,748 --> 00:28:22,073
that is until one sticks,
like Andy.

514
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:26,680
- Can I get you a bite to eat?
- No, no. I'm good.

515
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:28,355
You sure?
(Knife slicing)

516
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:32,619
But if you don't mind,
who's your designer?

517
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,298
- House or clothes?
- House. That's a beautiful screen.

518
00:28:37,488 --> 00:28:40,189
That's Jennifer Jennings.
She got that for me.

519
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,852
I can get you her number
if you like.

520
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,969
No, actually, I know
exactly where to find her.

521
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,171
Well, you give Jenny-Jen
a big ol' hug for me.

522
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:47,799
Oh, I will.

523
00:28:48,845 --> 00:28:51,547
And I'm gonna dredge the river
and find your husband's body

524
00:28:51,548 --> 00:28:53,982
and make sure the coroner finds
a clear cause of death,

525
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:56,749
just in case
there was foul play involved.

526
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,009
(Door opens)

527
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:06,248
(Molly) It's turning out
to be a pretty good day.

528
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:07,603
Well, you sound happy.

529
00:29:07,604 --> 00:29:11,679
I've got a lead on my case, and tomorrow
Jake Colton will no longer be my husband.

530
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,887
Are you sure you wanna give up
the perks of being a senator's wife?

531
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:17,379
- I don't wanna be anybody's wife.
- Oh, so you're <i>that</i> girl.

532
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,526
I'm working on a case where the husband
forced his wife to have four tummy tucks.

533
00:29:20,527 --> 00:29:22,443
Not exactly
in a wedding bell mood.

534
00:29:22,444 --> 00:29:23,577
(Chuckles)

535
00:29:23,605 --> 00:29:25,082
(Cell phone beeps)

536
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,203
How long have you been
an interior designer?

537
00:29:27,204 --> 00:29:28,437
It's always been a passion.

538
00:29:28,438 --> 00:29:31,438
But it didn't become a business until
after your husband was murdered.

539
00:29:31,486 --> 00:29:35,942
(Huffs) And here I was, thinking
you needed advice on curtains.

540
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:40,476
(Chuckles) He was mugged in an alley.
Is that correct?

541
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:43,159
Stabbed in the heart
with a hunting knife.

542
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,360
- Dramatic.
- No witnesses, nobody ever arrested?

543
00:29:47,164 --> 00:29:49,711
(Swallows) Yes.
It was a tragedy.

544
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:51,791
Your husband was killed
in an alley

545
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:54,593
behind a hotel where he rented
a room several times a week?

546
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:58,779
We lived way outside of town. Sometimes
Nick stayed in Austin on business.

547
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,389
Your husband was killed
just after 3:00 in the afternoon.

548
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,979
If I had to guess, he had
a lunch meeting at the hotel.

549
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,681
Actually, he rented a room

550
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:11,958
and then ordered from room service
a $200 bottle of champagne.

551
00:30:12,838 --> 00:30:16,649
Marriages can be
so complicated, Ranger Parker.

552
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:21,554
How about yours? You're married
to Senator Colton, isn't that right?

553
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:22,719
Separated.

554
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,389
Oh, yes. I heard
the divorce is contentious.

555
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:31,009
- Now how would you know that?
- I decorate for some politicians.

556
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:34,529
People talk, especially
when you're in their homes.

557
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:38,091
You do have a good supply
of clients, don't you?

558
00:30:38,092 --> 00:30:41,336
After my husband died,
I never felt the call to remarry.

559
00:30:41,337 --> 00:30:43,214
I built a business
instead.

560
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:46,804
Could've gone back to Missouri,
where you were born on a farm.

561
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,412
Clearly, that's not
a question.

562
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,015
Your father was
an outdoorsman, a hunter...

563
00:30:51,271 --> 00:30:53,414
Skilled. He taught you.

564
00:30:54,405 --> 00:30:55,505
(Click)

565
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:57,325
We've spoken
for several minutes now,

566
00:30:57,326 --> 00:31:00,044
and I'm still not sure
of the purpose of your visit.

567
00:31:00,114 --> 00:31:02,448
Does the D.P.S. office
need a redo?

568
00:31:02,449 --> 00:31:05,268
(Chuckles) No,
we could never afford you.

569
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:08,144
- Well, I am rather expensive.
- Yeah.

570
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:11,491
Yeah, my guess...
about 30 grand a job.

571
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:13,671
Mm, that would be
on the low end.

572
00:31:13,717 --> 00:31:17,086
My level of expertise
does not come cheaply.

573
00:31:18,414 --> 00:31:22,893
Bobby Dean Tanner...
Fell off his boat.

574
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:26,292
Clete Reed...
Throat slashed.

575
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:29,384
Jason Noonan suffered
a grand mal seizure,

576
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:32,353
even though he had no
former neurological issues.

577
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:34,559
And you...

578
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:38,220
You redecorated
all their houses.

579
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:42,045
Maybe they die
when they get my bill.

580
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:11,171
(Bird calling in distance,
crickets chirping)

581
00:32:11,238 --> 00:32:13,973
(Dog barking in distance)

582
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:17,411
(Door opens)

583
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:19,328
I couldn't understand
how the middleman

584
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:21,458
knew so much about the lives
of these women,

585
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,700
but now it makes sense.
Women talk to their decorators.

586
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:27,736
She was in their homes
and got inside their minds.

587
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:30,273
(Wine pouring)
But now I'm inside hers.

588
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,675
She'd be stupid to try and kill
anybody else while I'm watching.

589
00:32:33,676 --> 00:32:37,693
- A lot of unhappy people out there, huh?
- Yeah, I was one of 'em.

590
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:39,875
Come on. Give me
that backstory now.

591
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:41,434
(Sighs)

592
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:44,687
Nope.
No, that I won't do.

593
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:48,853
- I won't bring Jake into our life.
- It's not about him. It's about me,

594
00:32:48,854 --> 00:32:51,821
understanding that part of your past.
It means something to me.

595
00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:53,923
(Sighs) Why?

596
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:56,226
At some point,
it'd be nice to be trusted.

597
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:02,371
- I trust you. (Chuckles)
- Yeah. (Clears throat)

598
00:33:03,188 --> 00:33:06,030
Try me. See if I run.

599
00:33:06,775 --> 00:33:08,210
(Kisses)

600
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,610
(Sighs)

601
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:12,763
Oh, you are so gonna wish
you didn't walk out on that limb.

602
00:33:12,764 --> 00:33:13,997
(Moans softly)

603
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:17,184
- Go on...
- Get in my plane.

604
00:33:18,174 --> 00:33:21,205
- That was a cheap trick.
- Said you trusted me.

605
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:24,776
- Anything else.
- Anything?

606
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,532
(Gavel bangs)

607
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,082
(Man) All rise.
(Chairs scrape floor)

608
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:37,477
Superior Court for the State
of Texas, county of Travis,

609
00:33:37,478 --> 00:33:40,462
the honorable
Judge Walter Garrity presiding.

610
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:42,633
(Lowered voice) I don't believe it.
He's a friend of Jake's.

611
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:44,467
(Lowered voice) Everybody's
a friend of Jake's.

612
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:46,391
Be seated.

613
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:48,423
Senator Colton...

614
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,881
Ranger Parker.
Nice to see you again.

615
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:56,363
Now I have before me
your petition for divorce.

616
00:33:56,364 --> 00:33:58,974
Yes, your Honor, the couple's
been separated for nearly a year.

617
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:00,747
Their differences
are irreconcilable.

618
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:03,751
- Senator, you feel the same?
- No, judge, I don't.

619
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:06,967
I believe there's hope.
I'm a very hopeful person.

620
00:34:06,968 --> 00:34:09,812
Well, it does take two to be
irreconcilable, doesn't it?

621
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:11,916
Sort of like
takes two not to tango?

622
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,178
I thought we were here
to just sign the final papers.

623
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,880
Now, Ranger Parker,
marriage is an institution

624
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:18,978
highly valued by the state,
the community,

625
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:23,122
not to mention the Church, and if there
is a hope of saving any marriage,

626
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:25,627
we all share a duty
to make that attempt.

627
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:26,967
This marriage is over.

628
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:31,048
I am the judge here, Ranger Parker,
and it ain't over till I say it's over.

629
00:34:31,676 --> 00:34:35,491
Now I'm gonna put
this petition on hold

630
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,659
until you can undergo
a course in marriage counseling.

631
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,418
- Your Honor...
- Wasn't that clear?

632
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,404
Thank you, Judge.
We'll give it our best shot.

633
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:47,641
(Huffs)

634
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:49,844
Why are you doing this?
(Door closes)

635
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:51,506
Uh, excuse me, fellas. I...

636
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:53,508
- Why are you doing this?
- Easy. Careful.

637
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:56,989
Because I believe our marriage
is worth fighting for.

638
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,382
You don't control me. You don't
have that right anymore.

639
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:01,031
If you really wanted out,

640
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:03,878
you would've already told the world
what you think happened.

641
00:35:03,879 --> 00:35:05,695
What happened?

642
00:35:06,017 --> 00:35:08,425
That the good and honorable
Senator beat his wife?

643
00:35:08,485 --> 00:35:10,423
- Molly...
- Sign the damn papers!

644
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:12,888
Just a few
counseling sessions.

645
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:20,937
(Sighs)

646
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:25,465
Your lawyer has to fight this, and if
he can't, we need to get you a new one.

647
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,834
Yeah, for a thousand
dollars an hour.

648
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:29,808
(Door opens and closes)
No wonder women hire hit men.

649
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:32,157
I'll kill that son of a bitch
for free... (Kisses)

650
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:35,136
If I could find my damn rifle.
You seen my varmint gun?

651
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:36,871
- In the tack room.
- No.

652
00:35:36,872 --> 00:35:38,988
Don't forget you have to take Lu
to swim practice tonight.

653
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:39,940
Ohh.

654
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:41,147
- D-don't tell me. Don't...
- Baby, I'm sorry.

655
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:42,820
- I can't.
- You're busy again?

656
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:44,443
(Sighs) You need to tell me
what is going on right now,

657
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:46,328
- ...and I want the truth.
- I have to go into town.

658
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:49,664
- Why? (Huffs)
- What is this? The Mexican Inquisition?

659
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,783
I need parts, okay?

660
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,300
The irrigation system in the back
pasture is all messed up.

661
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:56,567
I need to fix it, that's all.

662
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,803
And after the sun sets is
the only time the stores are open?

663
00:35:58,804 --> 00:36:00,835
Don't do that, Molls.
I'm not one of your suspects.

664
00:36:00,836 --> 00:36:03,070
Fine. Go. I'll take Lu.

665
00:36:03,257 --> 00:36:05,313
It's a pleasure to spend time
with my children.

666
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:07,448
(Lulu) Why don't you
wanna swim, daddy?

667
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:12,784
(Sighs) I do wanna go swimming with
you, Lu, but daddy's gotta work, okay?

668
00:36:12,785 --> 00:36:14,840
Go. Now. I mean it.

669
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:22,221
Mama's gonna drive you.
Let's go get your fins. Come on.

670
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:24,532
(Footsteps depart)

671
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,934
- Becca, don't go there.
- He's screwing around.

672
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:31,382
I know it. I know it.

673
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:34,708
(Sighs)

674
00:36:37,546 --> 00:36:39,079
(Nickers)

675
00:36:39,147 --> 00:36:41,048
(Cows mooing)

676
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:44,555
- How's it going, Ryan?
- I'm good out here, Ms. Parker.

677
00:36:44,753 --> 00:36:47,888
- Irrigation pump holding?
- Sure is.

678
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:51,859
- (Water trickling) System been down?
- No, ma'am. Not this season.

679
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:54,127
(Cell phone chimes)

680
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:56,196
(Mooing continues)

681
00:36:56,298 --> 00:37:00,595
___

682
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:09,976
(Cell phone rings)

683
00:37:10,044 --> 00:37:13,388
(Ring)

684
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:14,556
(Beep)
Hi.

685
00:37:14,557 --> 00:37:16,474
Are you really signing
the divorce papers?

686
00:37:16,477 --> 00:37:17,644
Uh, no.

687
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,312
Then what the hell
was that text?

688
00:37:19,313 --> 00:37:21,697
What text?
Look at your damn phone!

689
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:24,284
You just sent me a text saying
you signed the divorce papers.

690
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,889
I'm looking at it. I...

691
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:28,279
___

692
00:37:28,395 --> 00:37:30,262
I didn't send that.

693
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:33,019
I was in the shower.
I just stepped out.

694
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:35,961
Jake, listen to me.
(Thud)

695
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:38,847
Hello? Jake?
(Error tone drones)

696
00:37:38,848 --> 00:37:40,115
Jake!

697
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:43,909
(Siren wailing)

698
00:37:57,522 --> 00:37:59,656
(Groans)

699
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:01,999
What is this?
What do you want?!

700
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,134
Why does your wife
hate you so much?

701
00:38:04,438 --> 00:38:07,773
The mere mention of your name
makes her recoil.

702
00:38:07,774 --> 00:38:10,004
Ugh! Okay,
clearly you're insane.

703
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:13,408
(Panting)

704
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:15,693
No.

705
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,622
I'm just a woman who has a talent
and makes a living from it.

706
00:38:18,623 --> 00:38:20,569
What, breaking into homes
and tying people up?

707
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,370
- Good for you.
- Oh, no.

708
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,767
I kill people.

709
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:29,786
Men... when their wives
don't want them around anymore.

710
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:30,774
(Panting)

711
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:33,560
Women pay me to make sure

712
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,530
they never have to wake up again next
to the person they hate most in life.

713
00:38:37,531 --> 00:38:39,131
Like your wife...

714
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:41,946
She really doesn't want you
around anymore.

715
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:43,214
(Breathing heavily)

716
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,284
And that's a good thing
for me...

717
00:38:45,285 --> 00:38:46,585
Uhh!
(Chair rattles)

718
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:48,428
(Grunts)

719
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:50,733
Ranger Parker
is good at her job.

720
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,128
Too good.

721
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,293
I'm a State Senator.

722
00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:56,836
There are security cameras
all around this house.

723
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:59,463
(Gun clicks) Unfortunately, the one
in the the back is out of order.

724
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,465
(Click)

725
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:03,644
Stuff happens.

726
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,876
(Click) In a few minutes,
Molly Parker will arrive.

727
00:39:07,877 --> 00:39:12,538
Her image will be clear on the front
door camera and also her intent.

728
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:16,484
You sent her a text message saying
you signed the divorce papers.

729
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:19,953
Unfortunately, you're drunk...

730
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:21,726
When she gets here.

731
00:39:21,727 --> 00:39:24,325
You tell her you changed
your mind again.

732
00:39:24,326 --> 00:39:25,843
She's outraged.

733
00:39:25,844 --> 00:39:27,987
You tell her you'll never
let her go.

734
00:39:27,988 --> 00:39:29,823
She can't take it anymore.

735
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:33,774
Furious, the righteous Ranger
finally snaps and shoots you...

736
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:36,759
Right between the two...

737
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:39,770
Beady... little...
Eyes...

738
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:44,611
With this rifle,

739
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:47,947
the one they keep in the shed
at the Parker ranch.

740
00:39:48,116 --> 00:39:52,492
A fine ranger will go to jail for
the rest of her life for this, but hell...

741
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:53,659
(Gun cocks)

742
00:39:53,868 --> 00:39:55,769
Some men just need killing.

743
00:39:56,157 --> 00:39:57,892
Ohh!

744
00:39:59,427 --> 00:40:02,496
(Both grunting)

745
00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:06,051
Aah!

746
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:09,755
(Grunting continues)

747
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:12,573
(Gasping)

748
00:40:19,146 --> 00:40:20,513
(Gasps)

749
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:22,248
(Glass clatters)

750
00:40:22,316 --> 00:40:23,917
Uhh!

751
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:27,020
(Both grunting)

752
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:32,189
You should've let me kill
that arrogant bastard.

753
00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:34,158
Uhh!

754
00:40:34,226 --> 00:40:37,594
If I wanted Jake dead,
I'd kill him myself.

755
00:40:37,662 --> 00:40:39,526
Uhh!
(Thud)

756
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:41,899
(Handcuffs rattle)

757
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:43,234
(Panting)

758
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:47,537
(Clicking)

759
00:40:47,605 --> 00:40:50,440
(Police radio chatter)

760
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,728
Ouch.

761
00:40:54,512 --> 00:40:57,514
Complicated way to get law
enforcement off her scent.

762
00:40:57,582 --> 00:41:00,981
- Why not just kill you?
- (Huffs) Are you kidding?

763
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:04,354
If Jennings killed a ranger, every
cop in Texas would be on the case.

764
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,130
Forget every cop in Texas.

765
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,765
That woman would have
to deal with me.

766
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:15,265
(Chuckles)

767
00:41:15,332 --> 00:41:16,432
(Pats leg)

768
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:21,337

Well, that was eventful.

00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:27,610
I just saved your life.

771
00:41:27,678 --> 00:41:30,004
Sign the damn papers.

772
00:41:31,535 --> 00:41:33,288
No.

773
00:41:34,015 --> 00:41:36,190
I'm never coming
back to you.

00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:40,022

Hey.

780
00:41:59,777 --> 00:42:02,076
How steady is she?

781
00:42:03,123 --> 00:42:04,979
Strong enough
that you can lean on.
