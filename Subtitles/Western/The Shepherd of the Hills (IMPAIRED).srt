1
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,811
Kinda free with
your powder, ain't ya?

2
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:31,618
Not when I'm aimin' at
a moonshiner with four jugs
slung over his shoulder.

3
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:34,558
Accordin' to the law,
a man's got a right
to tote his liquor...

4
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:37,061
wherever it fits him best,
inside or out.

5
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,156
And he ain't a moonshiner
till he sells it and gets caught at it.

6
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,793
The way you talk up for these
superstitious mountain people,

7
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,303
you'd think that every third 'shiner
is your nephew.

8
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:49,273
Well, I've been up here long
enough for the government
to know just where I stand.

9
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:53,972
And you better be careful
potshottin' at these nephews
whose uncle I ain't.

10
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,140
<i>Hey, Charlie, come here!</i>
<i>Take a look at this!</i>

11
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:03,321
Uh-huh.
I told you I got him.

12
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,128
Cow.
Cow?

13
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:13,063
Yeah.
Lamentin' cow.

14
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,294
Full udder and
nobody to milk her.

15
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,303
Lamentin', huh?

16
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,197
Snakes.

17
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,623
Get these
hid away from here.
Let Wash do it.

18
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,561
Do what you're told.
Jim Lane's standin' watch
for us at Holler Ridge.

19
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,258
Let him find his own cover.

20
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,141
Get these things hid away.

21
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,179
Douse that fire.
Watch that smoke.
Are you deef?

22
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,880
Revenuers!
Dump that mash
and scatter till I call ya.

23
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:59,130
<i>Who lives there?</i>
<i>Jim Lane and his daughter, Sammy.</i>

24
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,086
Come in.

25
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,936
Andy!

26
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:35,065
Hello, Sammy.
You're lookin' fine.

27
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,109
How's everything with you, Jim?

28
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,644
Well, Andy,
I can't complain.

29
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:44,046
You're here just in time.
We got a powerful lot
of johnnycake and squirrel stew.

30
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,348
There's only one more plate,
unless they wanna eat stew
out of their hands.

31
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,981
No, thanks, Sammy.
We got business to attend to.

32
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,890
Well, are you satisfied?

33
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,163
So long, Jim.
Bye, Sammy.

34
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,165
Good-bye.

35
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,784
They hit me
without no warnin'.

36
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,013
Easy. Easy, young'un.

37
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,057
Don't hurt out loud, Pappy.
Here. Careful.

38
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:29,185
The murderin' hounds.
I was right down at
the fork of the creek.

39
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,730
Young Matt givin' you sorghum beer
for spottin' revenuers...

40
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,426
while he's totin' his corn whiskey
down into town!

41
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,867
Someday I'll—
Don't aggravate yourself.
It's me is shot.

42
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,201
'Tain't like it was
Young Matt's fault.
Yeah!

43
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,834
It's you that's shot,
just like you said.
Not him!

44
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,554
Come in.

45
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,191
What do you want?

46
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,292
My name's Daniel Howitt. L—

47
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,546
Don't you touch him!

48
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:26,347
This looks bad.
It's stopped bein' bad
and turned worse.

49
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,580
I can take care of him.

50
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,760
That bullet's still with him.
I said I can take care of him.

51
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,965
I got salve.
I got cobwebs—
This is no time to argue!

52
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,339
Boil some water
and get some clean rags.

53
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,793
When do you aim
to take him?
Take him?

54
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,633
You're just wellin' him
to take him to jail,
ain't you?

55
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:23,106
I've been tryin' to tell ya.
I'm Daniel Howitt.

56
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,974
I came here to get some information,
to get acquainted.

57
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,013
Why?

58
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,380
Well, I'd like to buy a piece of land,
settle down here.
Why?

59
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,387
I- gonies! The man was
right clever with me,

60
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,616
and you act like
he was a fine-hair.

61
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,354
Folks like him
don't come to land
what's been corned out.

62
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:46,125
Land with seed ticks
and chinch bugs
and whoopin' cough and—

63
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,269
Why'd you come?

64
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,534
I didn't ask you
how he got shot.

65
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,675
No, you didn't, for a fact.

66
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,223
Evenin', brother.

67
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,935
Hello, Sammy.

68
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,733
Keep joggin', Young Matt.
Don't get off that horse!

69
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,741
Don't get your dander up.
I just come to see
is your pa home.

70
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,869
He is, and we don't need
you and your kind
askin' after him.

71
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,244
I guess then I'll have
to invite myself in.

72
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,119
Get on up the hill,
Rowdy.

73
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,815
<i>Tell Aunt Mollie</i>
<i>I want stack cakes...</i>

74
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,120
<i>and roast yearlin'coon</i>
<i>with plenty of gravy!</i>

75
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,855
And tell her we ain't aimin'
to stand for no more
sickness and misery!

76
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,423
My, ain't the birds
a- hollerin' pretty.
You and your devilment!

77
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,027
Aunt Mollie and Old Matt
and their poison ways,
makin' people scared of livin'!

78
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,072
There's bluebirds nestin'
all over the mountain.

79
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,631
Liquor totin' and gettin' drunk
and raisin'Jupiter to suit yourselves!

80
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,145
Your eyes are
cussin' pretty tonight.
Makin' the hants do your biddin'!

81
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,979
Givin' the sick a soon start to die,
makin' the well dark-eyed
and fearful.

82
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,486
Why can't your dead mother
keep her unhappiness
in her grave?

83
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,579
Leave my mother be.

84
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:28,693
Oh, Matt, why do you keep doin' it?
All the way up the trail he bled.

85
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,195
What are you talkin' about?
They shot him, Matt.

86
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,484
Did they—
I'm all right.

87
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,751
What happened?
I was drinkin' when
I should've been watchin'.

88
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,815
Andy Beeler?
Yeah.

89
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,954
And two new ones with him.

90
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,590
Looks like... he'll never learn.

91
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:05,894
Well, they're startin' somethin'
they better know how to finish.

92
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,810
Who's he?

93
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,857
My name's Daniel Howitt.

94
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,553
What's he here for?

95
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,791
He's my cousin.

96
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,526
Now, that isn't—
This here's
Young Matt Mathews.

97
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,600
Mr. Howitt says
he's gonna live here.

98
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,974
That's right.
I plan to stay here.

99
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:50,880
It ain't likely for strangers...

100
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,475
to find these parts
to settle down in.

101
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,850
I brought along some
good fishing tackle.

102
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,553
We might give 'em a try
when the weather's right.

103
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,124
Let me know can I do
anything for ya, Jim.

104
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,272
Even Sammy's sayin' it now, Ma.

105
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,276
All the lies they teached her.

106
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:30,245
Blamin' us for all
their ails and sufferin'.

107
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:37,151
You for all the unseen things
God lets be.

108
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:42,217
Me for the fightin' and meanness.

109
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:46,526
Well, maybe they're right
about me, but you—

110
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,903
I'll stop 'em.

111
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,601
Some one of these days
I'll find him,

112
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:02,707
him that...
never came back to ya.

113
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,836
Do you suppose the Mathews
would sell me some of their land?

114
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,069
Might... if you was that crazy.

115
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,076
They got money cramps.

116
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,341
But don't let 'em sell ya
Moanin' Meadow.

117
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:37,405
Moanin' Meadow?

118
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,951
That's where the hant
comes from.

119
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,682
Frogs as quiet as grave rocks,
and the light comin' from nowhere.

120
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,690
The trees don't rustle,

121
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,352
and the flowers grow big,
but they don't have pretty smells.

122
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,418
Bad land,

123
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:55,297
like everything has got
the name of Mathews is bad, exceptin'—

124
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,892
'Ceptin' Young Matt!
He ain't naturally bad.

125
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,336
Them's the ones
that makes him so.
Them?

126
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,340
Them as won't let the dead rest!

127
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,377
His uncle, Old Matt,
with his fire-spittin' tongue.

128
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,378
That old she-devil crow,
Aunt Mollie.

129
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,971
And Pete, without
no brains and no hope.

130
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,416
All of'em makin' Matt a sick soul,
raisin' him to murder,

131
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,181
to murder his pa
who run off and left him.

132
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,520
And all of'em guilting her,

133
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:25,292
she who never done no hurt
to no one of God's critters.

134
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,164
She?
<i>His mother.</i>

135
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,042
Coot.
It's Coot Royal.

136
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,710
The baby.
Yeah.

137
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,812
She's needin' some elm bark tea.

138
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,758
Poor young'un can't hardly breathe.
She— She's near dyin'.

139
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,387
I- gonies!
No, you don't, Pappy.

140
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,954
You stay here.
You're too gaunted.
I'll go with her.

141
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,058
It's just a trot and gallop
down the trail.

142
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,560
I knowed it.

143
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:32,392
I knowed it when I heared
the fox bark in the night...

144
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,864
and my voice growed damp
when I prayed.

145
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,121
Sammy.

146
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,721
Get a clean rag
and a little stick.

147
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,959
Fix me a swab, Sammy.

148
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:18,408
She's done it!
She's sent the hex on us!

149
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,672
It's me done it,
Granny Lady,

150
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,738
'cause I ain't never been
no good.

151
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,444
The sorriest critter
on the creek,

152
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,986
with things always
windin' out black for me...

153
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,023
and nothin' to give ya
but poke sallet and
no-good hog mollies.

154
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,958
You've given me
more than that!

155
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,155
You always call me "lady."

156
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,099
And I can sit here and rest myself
in a milk-white castle.

157
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,763
It's her in Moanin' Meadow
that walks through the night,

158
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,569
touchin' nothing
but layin' her hand on all.

159
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,405
It's them darn Mathews
on the knob.

160
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,710
It's him, the spittin' snake
that never come back to claim
his own wood's colt!

161
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,478
<i>It's him!</i>

162
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,088
The stranger, Coot,

163
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:41,149
he brung her back to us
like a good shepherd.

164
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,669
Your little girl was choked up
and became unconscious.

165
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,268
Just keep her throat clear
and keep her wrapped up warm,
and she'll be all right tonight.

166
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:03,974
By tomorrow, she'll be beggin'
to wade the creek and askin'
what makes the sky blue, won't ya?

167
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,779
Your daddy will be gettin'
anxious, won't he, Sammy?

168
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,514
Stranger?

169
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,658
Did you ever get to feel
how good mud is?

170
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,323
No, but I wish I had.

171
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,367
I almost stepped
on a cloud.

172
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,878
Morning, and howdy
to ya, Sammy!
Same to you, Kip.

173
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,614
Wife mendin'?
Fine. She's talkin'
like a windmill.

174
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,088
Mmm! Goggle-eyes!

175
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,285
Yeah. Catched 'em
down by the ol' Beany.

176
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,453
<i>Grasshopper bait?</i>
<i>No. Noodlin'!</i>

177
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,463
Yeah?

178
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,959
Hello, Mrs. Schulz.
How's the baby?

179
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,631
Just fine, Sammy.
Wait, Sammy.
I wanna go in the store.

180
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:38,369
We might need more money
when we get up to Mathews'.

181
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,572
Corky? He won't lend you no money.
He won't even let you look at none.

182
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,747
I don't want to borrow any money.
I only want to cash a check.

183
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,450
A check?
Yeah. A check is
a piece of paper, a note.

184
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,194
Like a mortgage?

185
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:01,926
Well, no, not— not exactly.
A check is a—A check is an exchange.

186
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,438
You mean, like a swap.
Well, uh, yes, in a way.

187
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,533
You see, a check is—
A check is a letter,

188
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,044
a letter to the bank
where I have my money,

189
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:18,242
tellin' them to— to pay cash
to whoever has that letter.

190
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,446
Is it honest?

191
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,152
Yes,
if you have the money
in the bank.

192
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,997
All right,
I'd like to see you do it.

193
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,832
Hello, Hank!
Hello, Sammy.

194
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,532
<i> Let's see,</i>
<i>Mrs. Palestrom.</i>
Hello, Mrs. Kundy.

195
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,405
I got Coleby's Cholera
Tincture, Miss Wassop's
Soothing Syrup,

196
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:48,207
Kittredge's Salve
and Wahoo Tonic.

197
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,680
Could be she might
be needin' worm cakes.

198
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:55,448
Nope, 'tain't that.
I put a dried tater chip
and two crawdad legs in her bed,

199
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,786
but she's still got that seldom feelin',
complainin' from head to heel.

200
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,417
How much is them?

201
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,157
I'm gettin' tired of soakin'
sugar s-s-sops.

202
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,461
Better do somethin' about
that neck rash you got there.

203
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,297
'Tain't rash. It's the dye
from off my shirt.

204
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,668
I didn't souse it enough
in lye water.

205
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:17,800
You oughta see our young'uns—
just like a passel of pure redskins.

206
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,276
Them's 30 cents.
The mouthpiece is for nothin'.

207
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,677
Thirty cents!

208
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,482
Howdy, Sammy.

209
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:30,514
Been wantin' to meet your cousin.
Hello, Mr. Howitt.

210
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:32,557
How do you do, sir?

211
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,651
He wants to cash a check— one of them letters
to where he's got money in the bank.

212
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,253
How much do you reckon
to want, Mr. Howitt?

213
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,494
Well, if it's convenient,
I could use a hundred dollars.

214
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,138
You could use a hundred dollars?
<i>Yes, if it's convenient.</i>

215
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:57,580
Wh—Wh—
Well, uh—

216
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,981
I have letters of
identification here.

217
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:05,513
Well, uh, Sammy's say-so
is all right with me.

218
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,024
I- I'll look around.

219
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,589
Smart.

220
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:17,390
Twenty-five, 30, 35, 40.

221
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,862
Forty-five.

222
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,901
It's Confederate.
Forty will do me fine.

223
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:29,839
I didn't dig into my real reserves.
They ain't here.

224
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,609
There you are, sir.

225
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,307
Thank you very much.

226
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,342
Look out, Al.

227
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,789
You know about them
city telephone machines for talkin'?

228
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,729
Yeah.
What about 'em?
Seems foolish to me.

229
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,565
Ain't nobody in the Ozarks don't know
you got a hundred dollars right now.

230
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,933
Remember now, you keep shut.

231
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,376
I'll do the talkin'.
Anything you say,
Sammy.

232
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,711
It ain't gonna be so pleasant,
on account of Aunt Mollie, it ain't.

233
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,250
She always looks at ya
like a sheep-killin' dog.

234
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,718
How 'bout Old Matt?
Oh, him?

235
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:20,690
When he finds out you got a hundred dollars,
his eyes will get bigger
than buckets of hog lard.

236
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,811
Don't open it.

237
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,609
They'll shoot ya
clean back to the valley.

238
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:52,756
Hello!

239
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,019
<i>Hello, there!</i>

240
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,944
He ain't totin' no gun.
Come on.

241
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,432
I told you afore
you ain't wanted here.
Where's your woman?

242
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,436
Down by the hog scald.

243
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,474
So you're the cousin, eh?

244
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,979
<i>What do you want?</i>
He wants to buy
some dirt land.

245
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:54,281
Go on in.
I'll fetch my woman.

246
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,302
While I worry him,
you head for the house.

247
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,954
He's ornery, just like
them he watches for.

248
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,355
He ain't educated
to city talk.

249
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,829
You gotta twist him
around a pole or somethin'
to get what you want.

250
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,094
You see?
Yes, I do.

251
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,995
Friends, Pete.

252
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,043
Won't nobody hurt ya.

253
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:44,660
That's Pete.
He ain't right.

254
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,254
Pete? Mollie
and Old Matt's boy.

255
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,130
Young Matt's cousin.

256
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,601
Well, pretty near it.

257
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,025
Aunt Mollie,
this is Mr. Howitt.

258
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,562
Strangers ain't wanted.

259
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,793
What brung you here?

260
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,232
He wants to buy
some Mathews land.

261
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,075
He's my cousin.
He's got a hundred dollars.

262
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,840
Shucks.

263
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:41,819
For a hundred dollars,
we can let you have that finger of land
down by the twisted sassafras.

264
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,282
No?
No!

265
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,620
If it's a question of more money,
Mrs. Mathews,

266
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,889
I'd be glad to give you a hundred dollars cash
and something each month.

267
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:54,159
We got them uplands
on the sun side.
Ain't been brushed off yet.

268
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,292
But if you're lookin' for—
He ain't!

269
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:03,171
I'd like to buy Moanin' Meadow.

270
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,972
Shut up!

271
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:25,020
Not for no hundred dollars.
No.

272
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,691
It'd take more money
than you'd ever have.

273
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,328
It'd take a thousand dollars.

274
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:36,169
All right,
I'll pay a thousand dollars,

275
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,005
if you'll allow me
to give you the hundred dollars now...

276
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:44,242
and $75 a month
until the thousand is paid.

277
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:48,843
You'll pay...
a thousand dollars?

278
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,014
Yes.

279
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,149
Have you pen and paper?

280
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:29,386
You unbounded your word and spoke.
That's what ya done.

281
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,190
A hundred dollars
and promised more.

282
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,255
You made a swap
with a bad tangle in it.

283
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,270
Smell.

284
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,098
Besides which, on account
of you disobeyin' me,

285
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,938
you bought
an unhappy land.
Well, you see, Sammy—

286
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,638
Moanin' Meadow.
Won't nobody come
to pay you company there...

287
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,647
nor warm by your fire with ya.

288
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:54,776
Well, it might be that unhappy land,
like unhappy people,

289
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,788
needs someone to care for it.

290
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,859
I beg the good omens I've had
through the week to counter
the spell of the spirits...

291
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,527
who seek to dampen the wishes
I've knotted in yarn or darken
the luck of pulley-bone's charm.

292
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:16,267
One and one is two, and three add to five.
Dead spirits stay dead and live ones alive.

293
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,468
Listen, Sammy—
See that buck brush,
Mr. Howitt?

294
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,671
Well, up past it into them chinkapins,
then you travel up the steep hill,

295
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,839
down past the deer lick
into them low, big gaps.

296
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:27,715
That's Moanin' Meadow.
Good-bye, Mr. Howitt.
Sammy, there's no sense to all this.

297
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,549
I'm tellin' you for
the last and final time,

298
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,989
them that goes in there
has daylight dreams
and always disremembers.

299
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:38,961
And there's poison plants
and poke berries and nightshades
dancin' with the bats.

300
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,021
Good-bye, Mr. Howitt.

301
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:39,719
That snag in
your shoulder ailin'?
Not any.

302
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,726
It's just that from the time I was
shucked out of knee britches,

303
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,194
I ain't been so
crowded 'round with notions.

304
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,132
I brung ya
a brand-new kiss for luck.

305
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,675
Restin' up from devilment?

306
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:07,616
Nope. Just
committed some.

307
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,887
Brung you that lace neckpiece
for your throat.

308
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,002
Um—

309
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,943
These pants is got
thorns in 'em.

310
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,132
Like you was sayin', Jim,

311
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,566
a blue-eyed filly is
the most worrisome kind to gentle.

312
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,571
- What?
<i>- No mind what you do,</i>

313
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,369
<i>you never get a</i>
<i>friendly whicker out of'em.</i>

314
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:08,572
Well, the last I recollect,
we was speakin' of notions.
That's what I mean.

315
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,740
You get to whisperin'
to yourself...

316
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:15,479
when there ain't
a single word to say.

317
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:19,922
Bees bumblin' at ya,
you get all tongue-tied,

318
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,357
<i>start smilin'sidewise.</i>

319
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:26,658
And you see plumb fancy
with your eyes shut tight.

320
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:31,225
Feelin' that way,
a man most generally
falls off to sleep.

321
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,430
I- It don't make
a speck of sense.

322
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:39,807
Oh, it 'tain't the sleepin'
or the talkin' back and forth
in your dreams.

323
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,677
It's— It's the wakin' up
and findin' out...

324
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,308
you been dreamin'
to suit yourself.

325
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:54,681
Well, it's just like you been sayin'
and I been wonderin'.

326
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:59,423
The heavier the man,
the deeper his boot track.

327
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,591
It just don't make no sense,

328
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,725
love don't.

329
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:09,432
But there it is.

330
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:17,913
Well, I guess supper's coolin'
and waitin' at our house.

331
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,816
<i>Bye, Jim.</i>
<i>Bye.</i>

332
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,132
Bye, Sammy.

333
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,911
"I've been sayin',
and he's been wonderin'."

334
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,177
What in thunderation
was he talkin' about?

335
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:59,052
Somethin' inside you gets
to hurtin', you're breathin'
so awful bad,

336
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,217
you wanna yell out loud.

337
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,490
And you know you're walkin'
up a road ain't got no end.

338
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:10,057
For the sake of
my tired soul's confusion,
what are you aimin' at?

339
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:15,162
He's been talkin' pretty words
fenced around with no meanin'.

340
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,640
'Cause love don't make
no sense, it don't,

341
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:22,805
not when a man's
got on his mind what
Young Matt's sworn to do.

342
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,416
Uh-huh!

343
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:03,817
Smelled that peppermint candy
all the way up here, didn't ya?

344
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,034
Here, Pete.

345
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,850
Something's wrong.

346
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,764
Something's wrong around here.
What is it?

347
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,858
Everything's as usual,
and better.

348
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,268
Set and eat.

349
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,734
What's he tryin' to say?

350
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:05,646
What you been wantin'
most to do, Matt?
What are you gettin' at?

351
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,946
Look.

352
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,151
A hundred dollars,
and more to come.

353
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,190
Your waitin's over, Matt.

354
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:30,704
You sold Moanin' Meadow.

355
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,971
For your sake.
Look!
Hatin', hatin'.

356
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:38,981
You sold it,
and you got no right!

357
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,041
She's my sister
same as she's your mother.

358
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,611
Only <i>she</i> has got a right
to be in Moanin' Meadow.

359
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,558
Go on!

360
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,390
But before you do it,
you gotta know this.

361
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:56,195
It's me runnin' the Mathews,
and not you whose bornin'
brung the misery on us.

362
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,860
I know what I am.

363
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,428
Then don't be forgettin'
why us are livin' on the hill,

364
00:44:02,506 --> 00:44:05,634
hidin' from folks' laughin'
and talkin'.

365
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,234
Don't no one ask us
to no get-togethers.

366
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:12,271
They don't want nothin' to do
with no kinfolk of your mother's.

367
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:15,216
No stranger's gonna trample
on her grave.

368
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:18,743
You can't rest her easy
by killin' strangers.

369
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,723
Kill him what put
the idiot curse on my son.

370
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:25,990
Him what killed her,
not the one that's gonna give
you the money to do it.

371
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,156
Poison talk.

372
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,369
You witch-woman you.

373
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:42,401
You... with
your sermon of hate.

374
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:45,471
<i>Castin'a spell</i>
<i>onto all of us!</i>

375
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,211
A- drivin' Young Matt to murder.

376
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:52,085
You fool!
You blind-drunk fool!

377
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:55,956
You're right.
You're right.

378
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,358
I sat there sayin' to myself,

379
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:01,921
"Why don't ya stop him?
'Cause you can't.

380
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:07,369
"'Cause why? 'Cause you ain't got
the backbone of a fishworm. That's why.

381
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,669
And once more,
you're tromped down!"

382
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,209
Ah, I "seed" it...

383
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:18,943
the night she lay dyin'
over in her cabin... and alone.

384
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,144
Yeah, I told you I was
down to the forks,

385
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,619
but I seed it
with my own eyes.

386
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:29,591
You were full of the devil's sin,
and it was a-stormin'.

387
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,595
And little Pete went out to help,

388
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,564
and you followed him
and drove him out of the cabin.

389
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:39,864
A lightnin' tree felled him
and took away his senses.
You lie! You lie!

390
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:44,135
And she looked at you
afore she died, didn't she?
Didn't she?

391
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,335
No!
Yes!

392
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:52,076
And anyone that
looks at a dyin' body's face
will be the next one to die!

393
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:57,587
So you put your Satan's sin
and filled Young Matt with it.

394
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,851
Heh! "Counter the curse...

395
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,360
by killing the one
that wronged her."

396
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:10,128
Hmph. And all this I knowed
and seed with my own eyes...

397
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,327
and held it inside me.

398
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:16,228
I done that for you, Mollie,

399
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,267
'cause you're mine.

400
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,862
I gotta ask you to get off of
this place, Mr. Howitt.

401
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:21,098
But I bought this place.
It ain't for sale.

402
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,538
You'll get your money back.
Look, Matt, this place is mine.

403
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,008
I don't wanna hurt
no kinfolk of Sammy's.

404
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:31,207
You won't be.
I'm not Sammy's cousin.

405
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:34,250
She just said that to protect me.

406
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,752
Well, then get off of here
and get off quick.

407
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,813
Look, Matt,
I bought this place.

408
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:44,088
And among honest people,
a trade is a trade.

409
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:08,207
Let me borrow
that gun, Matt.

410
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:20,720
Some folks ain't to be trusted
with a loaded gun.

411
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:25,564
Remember what I said.
I'll be lookin' to see you gone.

412
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:01,966
It'd be bad luck
to start up housekeepin'
without some salt, bread...

413
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,803
and a sweepin' broom.
Thanks.

414
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,571
It's the right notion, Sammy.

415
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,340
With the way things are
in our mountains now,

416
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:13,144
it needs more than salt and bread
and a sweepin' broom.

417
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,878
Can't hardly believe it myself.

418
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:19,320
But it wasn't always
that way.
No, they wasn't.

419
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:22,051
Folks was happy.
They sung songs.
They worked.

420
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:25,617
Now all they do is set around
and try to outsmart the government.

421
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,256
Seems like people nowadays
are stagnatin'...

422
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:31,028
and filming over like a—
like a pond dryin' up.

423
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:36,895
Maybe there's a way of goin' ahead
by getting back to where you were.

424
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:45,876
Maybe if we four begin it—
help to lift the burden—
others'll come to help.

425
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,474
You know how I feel about it.

426
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:51,419
You can count on me.

427
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:54,286
Well, seein' as how
we're all of one mind,

428
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:57,555
let me unpack you
from Moanin' Meadow.

429
00:49:57,627 --> 00:50:00,027
That's home, Sammy.

430
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,565
But you folks
come and see me.

431
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:06,068
You can have a fence full of open gates
'round Moanin' Meadow.

432
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,468
You'll never be crowded
for company.

433
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:11,371
Come on, help me.

434
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,476
Andy.

435
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,805
Here, I'll take that.

436
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,352
Why, I almost forgot.

437
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,731
I bought you that.

438
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,001
Bye.
Bye.

439
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,003
Bye.

440
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,432
Must be the Lord marks folks...

441
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,276
to favor a purpose.

442
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,759
One and one is two, and three goes to five.
Dead spirits stay dead and live ones alive.

443
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:46,462
One and one is two and three goes to five.
Dead spirits stay dead and live ones alive.

444
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,014
Sammy, it's good to see you here.

445
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,185
<i>Come in.</i>

446
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,370
Sit down, Sammy.

447
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,905
I can't sit,
and I can't stop shakin'.

448
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:59,601
I couldn't sleep a wink.

449
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,338
I can't stop the feelin' inside me.

450
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,682
Past and present go together.

451
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:14,855
I knowed it from the first.
You and Young Matt— son and pappy.

452
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:20,429
Him and your eyes,
and you and his.

453
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:24,456
And the way his mouth laughs
when he don't want it to.

454
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,195
I'm glad you know.

455
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,570
Sit down, Sammy.

456
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,953
Someday, he's gonna look good at you
and see himself lookin' back at him
from outta your eyes.

457
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,690
Someday,
he's certain bound to know.

458
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,994
Someday, he is
certain bound to know.
I'm gonna tell him.

459
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,934
He swore a blood oath
to kill ya when he finds ya.

460
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,738
Listen, Sammy. He's my son.

461
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:11,770
If dyin' for him would help,
that would be easy.

462
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:17,647
But I know that if he kills me,
he loses himself... and you.

463
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,690
<i>It would mean just one more</i>
<i>generation of misery.</i>

464
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:24,794
I know what it means
to go through life
empty and alone.

465
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,226
I won't let him do that.

466
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:35,434
I don't know how
and I don't know when, Sammy,

467
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:38,497
but I will find a way
to tell him.

468
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:42,011
I must find a way to help him
unswear his blood oath.

469
00:54:45,148 --> 00:54:49,346
Before, it was just some worthless man
that Matt always hated.

470
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,955
Now it's you.

471
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,621
Whoa!

472
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,447
Wash, take this.
I got somebody I wanna see.

473
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,561
That sums up to $4.00, Corky.

474
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:44,498
Reckon I'll have to ask you
to pass me by this time.

475
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,501
Overstocked.

476
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,678
I'm waitin', Corky.

477
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,975
<i>And waitin'aggravates me.</i>

478
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,641
Can't blame me, Wash.

479
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:03,686
Ain't nothin' I can do about it
if folks have changed and—

480
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,948
and lost their appetite for thirstin'.

481
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:19,665
These hills don't change for nobody.

482
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:24,197
And there's some people around here
that are overdue to learn that.

483
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:27,437
<i>It's hindsight</i>—
<i>changin'old friends for new.</i>

484
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:34,649
Corky, if you can't
sell that to nobody else,
you sold it to yourself.

485
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:39,484
I reckon I just temporarily
lost my manners.

486
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,615
Yeah.

487
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:07,410
Been tryin' to figure out
what it was I liked about you.

488
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:12,453
Come to find out it's the easy style
you unload a full-up wagon.

489
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:15,355
Hello, Matt.

490
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:36,411
What are you doin'
down here?

491
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:40,415
Get outta there!
He's working for me, Wash.
He's helping me with the sheep.

492
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:42,474
Workin'?

493
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,755
For you?

494
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,018
You get on up the trail.

495
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,752
Get up the trail, I told ya!

496
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:59,358
Pick him up, Wash.
Me? That idiot?

497
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:03,565
Pick him up!
Pick him up yourself.

498
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,949
Shoo, shoo, shoo!
Shoo, boy!

499
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,667
Oh!

500
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,767
Oh, I didn't mean
to hurt <i>you</i> none.

501
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,920
Thanks.

502
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,636
Let's go home.

503
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,505
Come on, Pete.

504
01:01:05,762 --> 01:01:08,663
It's a funny thing about him.

505
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,359
As far as I can remember back,

506
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:15,336
he's either fightin' agin ya
or he's fightin' for ya.

507
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:25,109
Ain't nobody got a right
to Moanin' Meadow.

508
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,649
My mother's buried there.
It's hers.

509
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,776
I told him it was an unhappy land.

510
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:34,448
All he said was, "Maybe it just needs
a- carin' for, like unhappy folks."

511
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,550
He didn't ask me who shot Pappy.
He just went ahead a-helpin' him.

512
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:39,788
And Coot's baby.
Ever since he's been here,

513
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,422
he's been actin'just like
a good shepherd.

514
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:44,625
Even when he talks about
liquor drinkin',

515
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:47,431
he makes it sound more right
than why we shouldn't do it.

516
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:51,439
Well, it ain't him.
It's Moanin' Meadow
I'm talkin' about.

517
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:55,568
If he cares for Moanin' Meadow like he says
and like he cares for folks,

518
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:57,613
then he'll be a-helpin'.

519
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,514
Like what he's done for Granny Becky.
Sent her off to a city doctor.

520
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:05,213
Her blind-born eyes are gonna
be fixed so she can see out of'em.

521
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,958
He did that?
He did!
'Cause there ain't no bad in him.

522
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:13,484
There ain't nothin' but good!
Ah, Matt, let him stay.

523
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:18,622
Well, maybe.

524
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,426
I've been expecting you, Matt.

525
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:56,896
I come to ask are you still
of a mind to go fishin'.

526
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:02,800
- If you say so.
- The weather's right... now.

527
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:44,052
You know,
there's a funny thing about fishin'.

528
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,315
You can let your thoughts
drift downstream...

529
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,847
till they carry your troubles
clean outta sight.

530
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,528
Yep.

531
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:01,035
If I had me fins
where I got legs,

532
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:04,432
I'd paddle me
away from troubles...

533
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,771
instead of wadin' knee-deep
to meet 'em.

534
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:17,609
There's things come natural
with mountain learnin',

535
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,850
things I might could show you.

536
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,593
But...

537
01:04:26,662 --> 01:04:29,631
what I'm needin' now takes a...

538
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,499
man with city knowin' to tell me.

539
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,431
I'd like to help you, Matt.
Can I?

540
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:41,266
Might be you could.

541
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:48,712
Say somebody was...
Iost from ya—

542
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,812
somebody you had to find,

543
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:55,413
somebody you was
in debt to kill.

544
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:02,555
<i>We got a curse on us,</i>
<i>we Mathews folks.</i>

545
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,634
A curse as old as... me.

546
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:11,070
<i>There ain't no rest for us,</i>
<i>livin'or dead.</i>

547
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:17,778
Not till I find him who
marked me for what I am and...

548
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:22,212
aged my mother too young
for her grave.

549
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:27,720
Matt,

550
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,884
what would it be like,
as long as you live,

551
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,724
having to remember
that you stopped a man's life?

552
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:39,527
Whole days when...
you couldn't forget.

553
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:45,239
Nights when you have
to face yourself...
and him alone.

554
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,569
Nights when—

555
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:52,637
when you just pray
for the comin' of daylight.

556
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,345
You think I wanna do it,

557
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:03,017
that it pleases me
to think about it?

558
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:07,586
I saw a fella kill a man once,
when I wasn't half growed.

559
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,963
But I stood up to it and looked,

560
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:15,637
'cause I knowed
that's what I was born to do.

561
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,375
But there's Sammy to think of.

562
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,811
<i>Sammy loves you, Matt.</i>

563
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,814
Sammy?

564
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:32,611
I got no right...

565
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,919
to love nor marry.

566
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:42,659
I gotta forget
thinkin' about Sammy.

567
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,997
We'll find him, Matt.
I promise you.

568
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:28,609
Dan Howitt he calls his name.

569
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:32,135
Settin' hisself up
as shepherd of the hills.

570
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,581
We don't need no shepherdin'.

571
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:38,142
We ain't allowin'
no stranger to come in
and hide among us...

572
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:41,678
and turn our mountain folk
away from their learnin'!

573
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:46,650
Makin' and drinkin' honest
corn liquor is blessed of old.

574
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,720
It's our livin'!

575
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:52,256
Already we been left
shorthanded at the stills...

576
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:56,361
and are gettin' closer
to where nobody'll buy
or drink our makin's!

577
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,942
A- spreadin' his reach
into the family.

578
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:13,821
If somebody's come to see us,

579
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:17,651
they're bad off to go a place.

580
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:32,197
I'm gettin' educated.

581
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:36,178
You was being spoke of,
Mr. Howitt.

582
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:39,408
Come on in,
if you're a mind to.

583
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,028
I knew you'd be expectin' me.

584
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,967
Payment on Moanin' Meadow.

585
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,548
Money's a thing hands can't dirty.

586
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:20,215
I brought you a message, too,
an invitation.

587
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,689
You can take it back
where you brung it from.

588
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:28,620
Granny Becky's back
from her operation.

589
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:31,029
They're removin'
the bandages tomorrow—

590
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,002
havin' what Coot calls "an unveilin"'
at Flying Clouds Bluff.

591
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,735
Becky was born blind.

592
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:42,368
She ain't never gonna see
'less she's born again.

593
01:09:43,445 --> 01:09:46,881
She especially wanted her cousin
Mollie Mathews to be at her first seein'.

594
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,421
Shut up shoutin'.

595
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:56,822
There's to be an all-day singin'
and dinner on the grass.

596
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,754
Promise to take me
with you, Pete?

597
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:05,425
Let 'em gather.

598
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:07,833
Let Becky see.

599
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:09,996
Let 'em sing.

600
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:12,836
You'll be missed
if you're not there.

601
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:23,116
Oh, I almost forgot you, Pete.

602
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,257
You earned it... and more.

603
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:37,696
Why, that's twice as much
as any two of us earned last month.

604
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,922
Here she comes.

605
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:42,977
You gotta get ready now, Ma.
I'm ready.

606
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,432
Thank you, God.

607
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:50,785
The first tear I ever seen.

608
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:55,717
A mighty pretty thing
for human gladness.

609
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,659
I'm a-seein'!

610
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:12,400
I'm a witness to the color
of God's good dirt.

611
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:30,024
I was savin' you, child, till these old eyes
got used to seeing pretty things.

612
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,998
Howdy, Granny Becky.
Hmm.

613
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:45,198
You and your chairs.

614
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:49,301
A- rockin' me to seein'
all over the place.

615
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,290
You mind speakin' to me?

616
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,165
Hello, Granny Becky.

617
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,398
You're Corky!
Yeah.

618
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:22,034
And me a-thinkin' you was
a sawed-off little one.

619
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:59,537
You're Mollie Mathews,
my blood cousin.

620
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:03,946
I asked a-purpose
to have you here...

621
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:08,080
'cause I recollect you had a gift
for love and kindness...

622
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:10,090
when you was a girl.

623
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,494
<i>Now there's a devil in ya.</i>

624
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,124
Your soul's et up with hate.

625
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:22,363
You meddlin' old fool.

626
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:28,472
We hadn't oughta come,
like I told ya.

627
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,055
I'm—
Sammy Lane!

628
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:53,124
Well, bless the sight
of you, child!

629
01:17:55,937 --> 01:17:58,303
And—

630
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:02,002
Who is he?
Him? You know him.
That's young Matt Mathews.

631
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:12,280
Then I'm as blind as ever I was.

632
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,880
He's no Mathews,

633
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:19,484
<i>no more than he's</i>
<i>a poisoned Baldknobber.</i>

634
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:38,570
No, Sammy.
He's kin to his image.

635
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:46,878
Son of his father,
if I can see at all.
That's Mr. Howitt.

636
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:03,632
Don't, Matt.
She told you the truth.

637
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:05,935
He was gonna tell you hisself!

638
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:09,543
<i>Get his rifle, Pete.</i>
Stay where you are, Matt.

639
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:12,910
And leave your rifle restin'
where it's at.

640
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:19,519
<i>Throw it away!</i>

641
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,613
Stop, you poor fool!

642
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:31,894
Let go, Pete!
Let go!

643
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:24,714
I wish I'd stayed stone-blind...

644
01:20:25,954 --> 01:20:28,479
in the good, clean dark.

645
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:48,799
What's done is done.

646
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:53,113
We'll go home.

647
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:49,770
<i>He</i> done it!
<i>He</i> done it!

648
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:54,172
If Pete dies, it's 'cause you all
are standin' around here
mournin' womanlike...

649
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:58,440
instead of sheddin' the blood
that laid the curse on the Mathews
from her day to this!

650
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:10,991
I guess...

651
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:14,261
I'm the only one to...

652
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:17,998
end the curse.

653
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:40,882
Don't. Please, don't, Matt.

654
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,925
I've been waitin'
and prayin' to stop ya.

655
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:47,393
You gotta turn back—
turn back from killin'.

656
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:53,131
Get out of the way, Sammy.
Go home.

657
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:59,500
If you go,
it's all ended between us,

658
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:02,935
all the feelin's and hopes.

659
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:08,774
There never was...
no hopes between us.

660
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:29,228
Don't.

661
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:31,704
Don't, Matt.

662
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,067
Matt.

663
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:41,973
Young Matt.

664
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:56,713
I got some words saved
to tell ya.

665
01:24:58,059 --> 01:25:00,027
Pete!

666
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:05,792
Pete. Son.

667
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:09,603
Ma.

668
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,139
I can remember...

669
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:27,179
when you had gentlelike ways...

670
01:25:30,592 --> 01:25:32,651
till the lightning tree...

671
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:37,690
took away my speakin'.

672
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:43,898
It— It made you die...

673
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:48,341
inside.

674
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:52,739
It's you...

675
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:55,578
who's the curse.

676
01:26:30,919 --> 01:26:33,979
Leave me alone
with my baby.

677
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:37,157
Please.

678
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:18,064
Mollie!

679
01:32:19,066 --> 01:32:21,057
Mollie!

680
01:33:10,718 --> 01:33:13,482
I've tended him
to the best of my knowledge.

681
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:18,887
Hurt like Matt is, a man's
got to have the will to live,

682
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:21,428
something he'd— he'd die for,

683
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:24,656
<i>to bring him back to livin'!</i>

684
01:33:56,497 --> 01:34:00,490
<i> The will to live.</i>
<i>Something to die for.</i>

685
01:34:02,169 --> 01:34:06,367
<i>He can't be blamed</i>
<i>for bein'learned to see</i>
<i>and fight for the wrong things.</i>

686
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:13,004
<i>I know, Sammy.</i>
<i>Why can't he live and see things</i>
<i>good and clean...</i>

687
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:15,014
<i>and know that folks love him?</i>

688
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:18,775
<i>I watched him comin'down</i>
<i>that meadow...</i>

689
01:34:20,054 --> 01:34:23,751
<i>and I saw myself 25 years ago...</i>

690
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:28,352
<i>with nobody there to stop me</i>
<i>from makin'that mistake.</i>

691
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:32,831
<i> I killed a man.</i>

692
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,835
<i>I've been servin'a prison term.</i>

693
01:34:35,903 --> 01:34:39,430
<i>That's why I never knew</i>
<i>Sarah was dying,</i>

694
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,532
<i>why I couldn't come back.</i>

695
01:34:43,644 --> 01:34:48,138
<i>And I didn't want Matt to spend his life</i>
<i>in prison for the same thing.</i>

696
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,451
<i>I'd rather see him dead.</i>

697
01:34:53,187 --> 01:34:57,647
<i>That's why I shot him... first.</i>

698
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:20,013
Ever since I...

699
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:24,316
got able to remember,

700
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:29,220
I've been sproutin' and...

701
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:33,624
growin' too fast outta my britches.

702
01:35:36,964 --> 01:35:41,867
I reckon I never growed any inside...

703
01:35:43,204 --> 01:35:45,764
till today.

704
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:51,139
It's kinda like...

705
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,772
being borned all over again...

706
01:35:54,782 --> 01:35:56,716
right side up.

707
01:36:00,888 --> 01:36:03,982
I ain't lost from nobody no more.

708
01:36:07,495 --> 01:36:09,725
Matt.

709
01:36:19,106 --> 01:36:23,099
Tell her I got a marrying notion...

710
01:36:24,545 --> 01:36:26,479
if she'll ask me real nice.

711
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:34,387
I'd admire to.

712
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:50,358
<i> Bijou!</i>
<i>Let's have Bijou!</i>

713
01:37:50,431 --> 01:37:52,558
<i>Bijou!</i>

714
01:37:52,634 --> 01:37:56,593
<i>Come on, Bijou!</i>

715
01:37:56,671 --> 01:37:59,139
<i>Let's have Bijou!</i>

716
01:38:00,642 --> 01:38:02,974
<i>Come on, Bijou!</i>

717
01:38:04,779 --> 01:38:07,270
<i>Let's have Bijou!</i>

718
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:11,310
<i>Come on, Bijou!</i>

719
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:13,650
<i>We want Bijou!</i>
<i>Let's have Bijou!</i>

720
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:36,960
I'll show ya if she's a lady
or if she ain't.

721
01:39:37,038 --> 01:39:40,098
<i>Attention!</i>
<i>What's going on here?</i>

722
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:44,611
Nothin'. I'm just sittin' here
minding my own business, and—

723
01:39:46,047 --> 01:39:47,981
Oh.

724
01:39:48,049 --> 01:39:49,880
<i>Rubio!</i>
Yes, sir?

725
01:39:49,951 --> 01:39:51,885
Another one of these,
and I'll close your dive!

726
01:39:51,953 --> 01:39:54,888
What can I do?
They all want to fight.

727
01:39:54,956 --> 01:39:57,550
Where's this girl Bijou?
Oh, she's gone.

728
01:39:57,625 --> 01:40:00,753
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>Bijou had nothin'to do with this.</i>
