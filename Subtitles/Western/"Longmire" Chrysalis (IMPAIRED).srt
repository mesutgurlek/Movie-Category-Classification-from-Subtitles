00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,240
fully capable of making
my own decisions.

163
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,034
Did you tell him, or
did he figure it out?

164
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,035
No, I told him.

165
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,953
Mm.

166
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,622
I didn't tell him everything.

167
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,375
What did you leave out?

168
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,212
How much money Jacob gave me.

169
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,338
How much did he give you?

170
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,799
750,000.

171
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,008
Dollars?

172
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,385
Yes.

173
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,472
That is generous.

174
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,599
- You're upset.
- I am surprised.

175
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,726
Yeah, well, apparently
you're not the only one.

176
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,395
There's already been complaints.

177
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,813
Jacob made a lot of
promises to the tribe.

178
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,107
How much were these
tribal casino checks?

179
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,362
About $745,000 less than yours.

180
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,737
Oh. [scoffs]

181
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:01,452
Henry, do you have any idea where
I can find some office space on the Res?

182
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,872
So I can start putting this money
back into the community?

183
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,709
There is not much in the way
of traditional office space.

184
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:11,629
You may have to be
non-traditional in your thinking.

187

[Walt] <i>Olivia can't make
it to school today,</i>

188
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,817
but she wanted me
to turn in her book report.

189
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,105
Olivia... she's so conscientious.

190
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,023
But why are you dropping it off?

191
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,110
Well, I wanted to ask you a few
questions about Olivia's father.

192
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,445
Ah, Vincent.

193
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,904
He's one of the good ones.

194
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,325
Attentive, reliable,
active in the school.

195
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,987
But that's no surprise...
he's the guidance counselor

196
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,119
over at the high school.

197
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,622
They're lucky to have him.

198
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,292
Well, Vincent Parr has gone missing.

199
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,753
He was last seen going into the
Four Arrows Casino last night.

200
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,547
The casino?

201
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,214
That doesn't sound like him.

202
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:58,385
Unless...

203
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,469
Unless what?

204
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,930
It's unprofessional to gossip

205
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,058
- about a student's home life.
- Well, it's not unprofessional to help

206
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,893
locate a student's missing parent.

207
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,022
[sighs] It's possible
that Olivia's mother

208
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:15,777
got herself into trouble, and Vincent
needed money to bail her out.

209
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,778
What kind of trouble?

210
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:21,407
I can't prove anything,
but when I do see her,

211
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,578
which is rare, she's real jittery.

212
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,540
Jittery... like drugs?

213
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,462
If word got out that I was
saying something like that

214
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:39,426
about a parent of one of my
students, I could lose my job.

215
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:42,971
Okay.

216
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,181
If something has happened to Vincent,

217
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,809
do you think Olivia would be
safe in her mother's care?

218
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,188
I really can't give you
an honest answer on that.

219
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,863
[door opens]

220
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,409
Did you find Vincent?

221
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,620
No luck so far, but Deputy Ferguson

222
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,789
is still at the casino searching, so...

223
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,666
Should I be worried?

224
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,001
Well, that casino's pretty big.

225
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,630
It's gonna take a while
to cover the whole place, um...

226
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,717
Do you know why your husband
was at the casino last night?

227
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,260
[scoffs] No.

228
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,929
The last I knew, he and Olivia

229
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,764
were driving back from getting gas.

230
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,475
Is that true?

231
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,601
No.

232
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,144
We were at the gas station earlier.

233
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,314
We had just arrived at the
casino when Dad called Mom.

234
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,025
Why'd your dad fib to your mom?

235
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,446
Dad said the casino was our secret.

236
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,282
He said it was okay since he'd won
so much money the night before.

237
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,744
The night before?

238
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,081
How much money did he win?

239
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,166
I don't know.

240
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,335
Olivia, do you mind giving me

241
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,170
a few minutes alone with your mother?

242
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,173
Ms. Safford gave me
your worksheets for today.

243
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,386
Now, I know Ruby would be happy
to help you if you need it.

244
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,304
Okay.

245
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,228
Um...

246
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,862
I'm sorry if this is a little direct, but
does Vincent have a gambling problem?

247
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,032
No, I don't think so.

248
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,534
You didn't know he was at
the casino either night?

249
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,994
No, I didn't.

250
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,664
Does your family have
financial problems right now?

251
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,252
No, Vincent's job at the high school
is the best job he's ever had.

252
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,799
So, if you didn't know
he was at the casino,

253
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,385
where'd you think he was?

254
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,640
I didn't think about it, really.

255
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,978
Well, Vincent usually picks
up Olivia after school

256
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,940
and then takes her to her
math tutor or piano practice.

257
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:03,569
After that, sometimes they pick up dinner
or groceries, then they head home.

258
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,823
What time do they usually come home?

259
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,367
I don't know.

260
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,202
Why not?

261
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,206
I'm not always awake when they get home.

262
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,293
[knock on door]

263
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,377
Yeah?

264
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,423
Walt, can I talk to you?

265
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,882
Yeah.

266
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,176
Excuse me.

267
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,976
[Ruby] Ferg just called.

268
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,979
A body turned up, middle-aged male.

269
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,147
And it fits Vincent Parr's description.

270
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,235
Okay.

271
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,737
I'll take a ride out to the casino.

272
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,032
No, he's not at the casino.

273
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:53,869
Ferg said the body is on the other
side of the county, 20 miles away.

274
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,456
[dramatic music plays]

275
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,216
What's the bus doing here?

276
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,384
One of the kids found the
body when they were walking

277
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,929
from that trailer park over
there to the bus stop.

278
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,265
Driver felt conflicted
about leaving a dead body.

279
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,226
How'd he feel about exposing a bus
full of kids to emotional trauma?

280
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,395
Well, I covered the body up,
but I don't think

281
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,814
we need to worry about
these kids being traumatized.

282
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,733
[Walt] Tell the driver he can leave.

283
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,736
Tell those kids to erase those
pictures from their phones.

284
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,573
[engine starts]

285
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,706
[Vic] Is that the father?

286
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,332
Looks like him.

287
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,420
If he was last seen at the casino,
what's he doing all the way out here?

288
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,047
I don't know.

289
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,465
You find out anything
else at the casino?

290
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,637
Not really. Malachi couldn't locate
any footage of Vincent Parr.

291
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,139
Isn't that sort of what you
expect Malachi to say, though,

292
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,642
if he and his goons are still
ripping off the big winners?

293
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,060
You know, Olivia said
that her father won big.

294
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,772
There's no money in his wallet.

295
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,694
[Walt] He's got these marks
across his stomach and his chest.

296
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,905
Looks like he was run over.

297
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,323
Anything else in his pockets?

298
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,534
There's no keys.

299
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,745
Just a broken phone and, uh, this.

300

[suspenseful music playing]

301

Ferg, let's get Vincent
Parr's body to the hospital.

302
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,467
If the kid who found the body was
coming over from the trailer park,

303
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,428
I'm gonna go over there
and ask some questions,

304
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,111
- see if anybody saw anything.
- And if they didn't, maybe someone

305
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,849
saw something at the casino.

306
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,516
[Malachi] Well, see,
that's the downside of running

307
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,107
150 state-of-the-art
security cameras 24/7.

308
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,568
There's lots and lots of movies.

309
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,363
- I'm still looking through them all.
- Right.

310
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:55,575
Always happy to cooperate
with an investigation, Sheriff.

311
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,036
Which is now a murder investigation.

312
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,122
Vincent Parr's body
was found in my county.

313
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,958
According to the victim's daughter,
he came here

314
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,751
the last two nights, and he was winning.

315
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,380
And I find it surprising that
you have no record of this.

316
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,132
Surprising, is it?

317
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,801
So, what are you thinking?

318
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,137
You think, uh, we're
covering something up?

319
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,389
Maybe it's just due to negligence on
the part of your security team, Jacob.

320
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:27,564
Malachi, please keep reviewing the video,
every single thing from the last 48 hours.

321
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:38,158
[Walt] Vincent Parr had his wallet.
None of his winnings were in it.

322
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,787
Malachi's loan-sharking
and mugging scheme

323
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,079
may have just escalated.

324
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,083
Okay, you have no proof
of this "scheme."

325
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,501
I won't, either, as long as Malachi's

326
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,837
the one in charge of
investigating himself.

327
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,800
You have any other theories right now,
aside from these

328
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,385
insane levels of corruption
in my organization?

329
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,469
I do.

330
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,767
Something happened in
room 503 of your hotel.

331
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:06,937
[Vic] Hello?

332
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,690
[knock on door]

333
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,695
Anyone there?

334
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,364
[Joe] Hey, there.

335
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:18,700
Everyone's welcome

336
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,785
at the Chrysalis Mobile Home Villa,

337
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,913
where caterpillars blossom
into butterflies.

338
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:29,543
If you're looking for a new house,
I got three cozy units available.

339
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,420
I'll take that under consideration.

340
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,255
Are you the manager? - Yes, ma'am.

341
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,634
Folks call me Joe-Mega,
because I used to be a mega partier,

342
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,387
but now I'm just mega-blessed.

343
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,015
Okay, Mr. Mega, did you happen
to see anything unusual last night?

344
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,475
No, why?

345
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,519
Well, this man

346
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,189
was found dead practically
in your backyard.

347
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,027
And he was driving this car.

348
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,321
I don't know that car,
and this man's not dead.

349
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,488
He's not?

350
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,865
Death isn't death.

351
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,992
It's just another stage of life.

352
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,203
An eternal chrysalis.

353
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,747
I'll let the victim know.

354
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,248
I'm sure he'll be delighted.

355
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,959
In the meantime, if you or any of your

356
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:15,757
butterflies remember anything,
go ahead and, uh, give us a call.

357
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,049
Yes, ma'am.

358
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,050
Okay.

359
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,389
Caitlyn, who was staying in
room 503 the last two nights?

360
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:29,561
It appears 503 is being held for
ten days by a corporate account,

361
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,689
a company called Manifest Destinations.

362
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,358
Anyone use the room last
night or the night before?

363
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,736
No, doesn't look like it.

364
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:37,821
Thank you.

365
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,407
We shut down Malachi's
last loan-sharking office

366
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,535
in the casino men's bathroom.

367
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,620
Maybe he's upgraded to a hotel suite.

368
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:51,583
Or maybe... you know, just maybe...
the numbers five zero three

369
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,337
refer to something other
than a room in my hotel.

370
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,007
Why don't you let me know what you and
Malachi find on those security tapes.

371
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,884
Yeah.

372
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,469
[dramatic music playing]

373
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,270
Caitlyn, how often

374
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,563
has Manifest Destinations
booked rooms with us?

375
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,901
Quite often, actually.

376
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,987
Huh.

377
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,989
Print me out a record, please, and, uh,

378
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,783
notify me of any further reservations.

379
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,618
And you know what?

380
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,287
Let's just keep this
between you and me, okay?

381
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,172
Hey, sir?

382
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,634
- Do you travel this road a lot?
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

383
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,346
Me and Tito here,
we scoot just about everywhere.

384
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,264
See anything unusual last night?

385
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,475
It's about that crazy lady, right?

386
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,893
[clears throat]

387
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:53,521
Yeah.

388
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,731
Where'd you see her?

389
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,608
Oh, right back there.

390
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,985
We were riding out for a
late-night milkshake.

391
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,279
And she pulled right up to us.

392
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,156
Said she was looking for a car.

393
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,616
What kind of car?

394
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:09,203
Blue... royal blue. [chuckles]

395
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,998
And, uh, what did she look like?

396
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,374
We didn't really get
a good look, did we?

397
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:18,587
I-It was dark, and the
poor thing, she...

398
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,340
she just seemed afraid to show herself.

399
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:23,592
Paws over her face and everything.

400
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,179
She... she was super-shaky.

401
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,264
Goofed out on something, probably.

402
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,143
When we asked what was wrong,
she just freaked out, sped off.

403
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,353
Huh.

404
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,938
And, uh...

405
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,316
What was she driving?

406
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,485
Oh, one of those little S.U.V.s...
a Honda.

407
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:45,198
And it had one of those
cutesy-pie mom, dad, and kid

408
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,533
stick-figure sticker on the back window.

409
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,746
I found the girl's mom passed out in
a Honda with the same sticker on it.

410
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,665
So, what? You think the mom did it?

411
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,832
[Walt] <i>I don't know.</i>

412
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,293
Okay.

413
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,215
You want me to call child
services about the little girl?

414
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,134
I mean, technically,
we're supposed to, right?

415
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,095
Technically, but there's
something I have to do first.

416
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,813
[dramatic music playing]

417
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,578
[knock on door]

418
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,222
We found Vincent.

419
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,308
You found my dad?

420
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,271
We're still trying to
figure out what happened.

421
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,690
Unfortunately, he...

422
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:06,320
your father was injured
very badly, and...

423
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,698
he didn't survive.

424
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:10,949
Mom.

425
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,368
I'm very sorry.

426
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,871
Mom, Dad's dead!

427
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,582
[crying]

428
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,541
Mom!

429
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,545
[whimpering]

430
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,516
[engine shuts off]

431
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,776
You didn't have to come all
the way out here, you know.

432
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:49,488
I would've found the place...
eventually.

433
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,323
Finding the place was not my concern.

434
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,700
Your safety was.

435
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,535
You love me like a father, don't you?

436
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,497
Yes, I do.

437
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:01,250
You're also underestimating
me like a father.

438
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,307
Henry, I can't use this as an office.

439
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,516
This is someone's home.

440
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,435
It was foreclosed last month.

441
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,406
[sighs]

442
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,617
There any other options?

443
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,826
Yes.

444
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,497
Other foreclosed homes in
worse condition than this.

445
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,000
[cell phone ringing]

446
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:52,385
This is Henry.

447
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,262
[Nighthorse] Ah, so
your phone does work.

448
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,057
I was beginning to wonder
why I haven't heard from you.

449
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,768
I have been somewhat busy lately.

450
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,145
Is that right? You find
a better way to get

451
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,980
your bar back than by helping me?

452
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:06,356
I have not.

453
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,733
[Jacob] <i>I didn't think so.</i>

454
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,070
Which means we need to have a talk

455
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,450
about what exactly Malachi is up to.

456
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,035

461
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,621
Hi, Donna.

462
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,540
It's me, Walt... Longmire.

463
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,793
Um, I guess I left a
message or two already.

464
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,211
Um, this is work-related.

465
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,004
Um, I got a young girl

466
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,757
whose father was found dead.

467
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,217
She's here with her mother.

468
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,469
She's a little unstable.

469
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,847
I'd like to put off calling

470
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,057
social services as long as I can.

471
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:25,018
So, I could use some
professional guidance.

472
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:31,150
You could call me back here or, uh,
just call Ruby, if that's easier.

473
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,985
Okay.

474
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,363

Damn.

478
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,690
- Hey, Ruby.
- [Walt] <i>Any word from the coroner yet?</i>

479
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,859
Oh, hey, Sheriff. Yeah.

480
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,570
<i>Vincent Parr was crushed to
death, just as we thought.</i>

481
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,657
Someone ran him over in the
last eight to 18 hours.

482
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,744
You know, I'm... I'm happy to wait here.

483
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,830
You know, just wait for the
results and the blood work.

484
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:30,042
No, that could take hours. I need
you to get over to the Parr house.

485
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,169
Take a look underneath the wife's car.

486
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,170
You think the wife ran him over?

487
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,619
Well, if she did,
there'd be damage to the undercarriage.

488
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,883
On it.

489
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,471
Can Olivia and I go now?

490
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,889
Soon.

491
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:49,811
We still need your help
in our investigation,

492
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,314
um, answering some background questions.

493
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:54,650
Okay.

494
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,985
[Walt] <i>When we found you
in your car last night,</i>

495
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,947
<i>um, you remembered getting into
it but nothing after that?</i>

496
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:04,952
Yeah, that's right. It's...
all a blank.

497
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,745
[Walt] <i>Is it possible that you drove out</i>

498
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,497
<i>to look for your husband and daughter?</i>

499
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,416
I don... I don't know.

500
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,045
- Did I?
- Apparently, you stopped to talk to a man

501
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,715
while driving out near where
Vincent's body was found.

502
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,927
[Melissa] <i>I don't remember that at all.</i>

503
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,137
What did I say to him?

504
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,725
You asked him if he'd seen
Vincent's royal blue sedan.

505
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,518
[Melissa] Really?

506
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,937
Well, I... I guess if he saw me...

507
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:36,065
I mean, I... I was really...
really worried about them.

508
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,860
If you were worried about
your husband and daughter,

509
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,821
why didn't you just call us?

510
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,574
Well, some... sometimes when I
get all worked up about things,

511
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:49,288
um, and I think something's happened,
like, a part of me knows it might...

512
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:51,205
might just all be in my head.

513
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:55,585
<i>I had... had an accident a few years ago</i>

514
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,587
that kind of changed things for me.

515
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,842
- You have some kind of head injury?
- No, nothing like that.

516
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,427
I'm just kind of in a lot of pain,

517
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,889
and, um, that can kind of c...
cloud my mind.

518
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,267
Yeah.

519
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,439
[sighs]

520
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,487
What do you think?

521
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,865
I think Melissa Parr's
addicted to painkillers.

522
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,492
Yeah.

523
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,995
That can be a pretty
expensive habit to feed.

524
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,331
- Yeah.
- Maybe that's her motive.

525
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,751
She kills Vincent for
his casino winnings.

526
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:39,630
She seems really nervous around me.

527
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,798
- That could just be the pills.
- Maybe.

528
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,010
Maybe if I wasn't around,
she'd open up more to you.

529
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,886
It's worth a try.

530
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,221
Yeah.

531
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,516
Why not order a burger
from your own restaurant?

532
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,393
And miss out on the best burger in town?

533
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,311
Why would I do that?

534
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,148
So, have you found out anything about

535
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,400
Malachi laundering money
through the Red Pony?

536
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,026
I am just delivering food.

537
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,820
I do not know what you
are talking about.

538
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:07,115
You think my office is bugged
and that Malachi is listening in.

539
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,535
Malachi, if you are listening,
Standing Bear and I

540
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:13,455
are conspiring as we speak
to uncover all your criminal activities.

541
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,457
You got that?

542
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,833
If we're gonna work together, Henry,

543
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,711
we have to at least pretend
to trust each other.

544
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:20,712
Fine.

545
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:25,133
All I know is that there is a lot more
money flowing through the Red Pony...

546
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,010
new revenue streams, too.

547
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,221
According to the ledger I found,
your casino is booking

548
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,808
my catering services
several times a week.

549
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,186
- Okay, that's news to me.
- Me too.

550
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,230
So, there must be a second
ledger with the real numbers

551
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,608
and the real sources of income.

552
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,776
- I have not found it yet.
- Try harder.

553
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:46,362
And when you find it,
keep an eye out for a company

554
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,824
called Manifest Destinations.

555
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,618
I think they're a front
for a criminal organization.

556
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,079
- Already? The casino just opened.
- Oh, yeah.

557
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,289
Everyone's trying to
siphon away the profits.

558
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:57,916
Ah, yes.

559
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,752
The profits that should
be going to the tribe.

560
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,422
Is this about Cady?

561
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,882
It has less to do with Cady

562
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,383
than about your priorities.

563
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,801
My priorities

564
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,594
are the well-being of our people

565
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,888
and the infrastructure of our community.

566
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:16,309
Schools, community centers,
access to legal aid.

567
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:17,978
And the people themselves?

568
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,107
Have you heard of "refeeding syndrome"?

569
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:31,158
It's when a starved body can't
process an excess of new food.

570
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,827
The body shuts down... dies, even.

571
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:37,873
For centuries, our people have been
starved of prosperity and opportunity.

572
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,463
You can't just open up a buffet and expect
a starving person to make smart choices.

573
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:52,762
You have to feed the starved
body a little at a time

574
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,890
so that it can get well again.

575
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,646
So, you are saving misguided
Indians from themselves.

576
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,356
You sound like the U.S. government.

577
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:09,445
You find anything under her vehicle?

578
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,864
I'll show you.

579
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,073
Here.

580
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,034
No marks, no mess.

581
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,620
Nothing at all? No blood?

582
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,162
Nope, it's clean.

583
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,040
Maybe I should look
under some other cars.

584
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,793
I'm thinking Malachi's and Darius's.

[Vic] Hey, Walt!

587
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,088
Yeah.

588
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,173
You got a call.

589
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,716
Donna call back?

590
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,051
No.

I'd give it four stars.

Is that why you called...

No, but I do have some

So, uh, grab some popcorn.

I got some footage of
your guy two nights ago.

And, yes, he was winning big.

608
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:21,602
[Malachi] No idea.

609
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,022
But I do know that Jacob didn't
want me to show you any of this.

610
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,357
Why are you showing me this?

611
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,025
[Malachi] Because, uh...

612
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:32,404
I have a granddaughter,
same age as his daughter.

613
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,199
I don't get to see her very much,
but, uh...

614
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,618
I'd do anything for that little girl.

Uh-huh.

Yeah, no, nothing new here.

Oh.

636

Um, maybe you and I could speak
in Walt's office for a second.

637
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:45,936
Sure.

Clearly...
she's going through withdrawal.

640
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,726
She was doped up when Walt
brought her in this morning.

641
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,239
So then you called
Child Protective Services.

642
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,491
So, when do they get here?

643
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,619
- We haven't called them yet.
- That woman is in no condition

644
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,372
to take care of her daughter,
and Walt's message said

645
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,499
that the dad had been killed, so...

646
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:10,335
I mean, what are we
waiting for here, huh?

647
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,754
The child to suffer
irreversible trauma?

648
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,882
The mother's a suspect
in the father's death.

649
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,094
Yes, all the more reason to call.

650
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:21,971
Okay.

651
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,723
Okay.

652
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,516
Okay.

653
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,061
[clears throat]

654
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,109
If we can observe and talk to
her for a little while longer,

655
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,863
we may be able to figure out how
and why the father was killed.

656
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,532
In fact, Walt just left to
give them a chance to open up.

657
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,787
You know, he knows that some people
wait for him to leave to start talking.

658
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:50,458
Okay, look, why don't you just stop
with the subtle insinuations?

659
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,003
You're... you're actually not very good
at it, especially not the subtle part.

660
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,213
Okay.

661
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,384
I find it rather coincidental that you
show up just minutes after Walt leaves.

662
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,722
What, were you waiting outside for him
to go so you could barely miss him

663
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,015
like you've been missing
his phone calls?

664
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,268
All right, well, you know...
[clears throat]

665
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,071
Walt hired you, so he trusts you.

666
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,243
So, he must see qualities in you
that aren't obvious to the naked eye.

667
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,331
So, I will give you the benefit of
the doubt and give you an answer.

668
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,501
You see, I missed a little
bit of work recently.

669
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,254
It's a long story...
you know, kidnapping, gunshot wound.

670
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,882
And so I have been working
overtime to make it up.

671
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,343
Does that work for you? Hmm?

672
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,971
Or do you have some follow-up questions

673
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,474
concerning your boss's private life?

674
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:50,894
[Vic] Thanks...

675
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,399
you know, for coming down to my
level and granting me a response.

676
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,402
But while we're on the
topic of not understanding

677
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,613
what Walt sees in other
people, let me be unsubtle.

678
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,823
[scoffs]

679
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,784
I have no idea what makes
you worthy of him.

680
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,702
I really don't.

681
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,163
But I saw him go through hell

682
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,705
when your life was in danger.

683
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:18,421
And so when he reaches out to contact
you, he deserves a response.

684
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:22,717
He deserves more than that, of course, but
he sure as hell doesn't deserve less.

685
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:23,634
Not from you.

686
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,304
Not from anyone.

687
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,165
- [Olivia] Mom, no!
- [Melissa] We've got to get out of here!

688
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,769
- [Ruby] You can't leave!
- No!

689
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,813
- I don't know what happened!
- Okay, calm down.

690
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,736
- No, no. I need to get home.
- Calm down, okay? You're in a safe place.

691
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,574
- I know.
- I'm very sick. I need my medicine.

692
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,736
All right, I cannot release
your daughter into your custody

693
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,980
- when you are in this state, all right?
- Okay, fine, I'll just leave her here,

694
00:38:45,024 --> 00:38:46,944
- but I need to go home.
- You do not have a car.

695
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:49,619
- Okay, then I'll call a cab! [panting]
- I got this.

696
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,247
Please put the phone down, all right?

697
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,958
Don't look at me like that.
Don't look at me like I'm a bad mom.

698
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,460
You know, I wouldn't say that.
That's not what I said, okay?

699
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,963
You're not a bad mom. Oh, God! Shit!

700
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,339
- [gasps]
- Okay.

701
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,467
- I'm sorry.
- No, okay.

702
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,927
- Okay. All right.
- I'm so sorry.

703
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,512
Nope, nope. It's fine.

704
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,847
- All right, okay.
- No!

705
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,099
Please don't touch me! No! Aah! Aah!

706
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:14,060
Okay.

707
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,004
I'm sorry.

708
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,673
I was told that this
room was unoccupied.

709
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,008
Can I help you?

710
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,219
Well, I'm Sheriff Longmire.

711
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,804
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions, Miss...

712
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,556
Missus, actually.

713
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,266
It's Mrs. Shawna Crawford.

714
00:39:54,184 --> 00:39:55,810
No, come on in.

715
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,645
Thank you.

716
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,439
I have to go to work in a few minutes,

717
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,066
- so I don't have long to talk.
- What kind of work?

718
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,902
I'm a travel agent for a company called

719
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,112
Manifest Destinations,
out of Massachusetts.

720
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,200
I'm here touring the hotel, putting
travel packages together and such.

721
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,535
So, what do you need?

722
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,038
Do you know this man?

723
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:20,043
Are you sure you're the sheriff
and not some P.I. my husband hired?

724
00:40:20,961 --> 00:40:22,795
Pretty certain, yeah.

725
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,798
Yeah, I recognize him.

726
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,717
I saw him gambling a few nights ago.

727
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,969
He looked... safe.

728
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,597
And I was a bit lonely and
a bit tipsy, to be honest.

729
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,142
So, we flirted a little bit.

730
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,688
I even wrote down my room number,
but I guess he wasn't interested.

731
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,316
And that was the last I saw of him.

732
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,759
- I actually never even got his name.
- What night was this?

733
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,903
It was two nights ago.

734
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,073
Did you see him last night?

735
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,535
No, just the one night. Why?

736
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,329
Well, he was found dead
in my county this morning.

737
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,998
He's dead?

738
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,334
I'm trying to piece
together his last few days.

739
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,921
Is there anything you could, uh,
tell me about your conversation?

740
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,298
Um, wow.

741
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,175
Uh, okay.

742
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:11,136
Our conversation, um...

743
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:17,017
Uh, well, he complimented me on my
vocabulary, which was a nice surprise.

744
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:20,853
Um, and he said he was on a lucky
streak so he couldn't leave the table.

745
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,314
And I remember thinking that
if he did come to my room,

746
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,609
I was setting myself
up for disappointment.

747
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:27,860
How so?

748
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,863
The more I talked to him,
I realized he was wasted.

749
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,450
- Vincent was drunk?
- He masked it well.

750
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,202
He wasn't slurring his
words or anything.

751
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,746
But his eyes and breath gave it away.

Hello?

00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,477
This is Shawna Crawford.

760
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,439
Yes, this is room 503.

761
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,568
It's for you.

762

I'm at the hospital with Melissa Parr.

I think we might have just
found another motive.

[indistinct P.A. announcement]

Yeah, okay.

767
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,963
Hey, I, uh... I got your message,

768
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,006
and you're absolutely right.

769
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:34,719
Suspect or not, that girl's mother is
in no shape to take care of a child.

770
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,430

other available family,

00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,934
- Thanks.
- Yeah, um...

773
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:45,938
I... I got your other messages, too.

774
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,315
Yeah, uh...

775
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:52,070
So, should I just mail your
blouse and other clothes to you?

776
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,696
[Donna] No, no, I'll pick them up.

777
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:54,697
Um...

778
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,907
Look, Walt, I know that we need to talk,

779
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,576
but you're... you're busy now,

780
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,369
so we'll just talk later.

781
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,995
Okay.

782
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,414
- Okay.
- All right.

783
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:14,467
Melissa Parr is in an exam room.

784
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,719
- Where's Olivia?
- Ferg's keeping her distracted.

785
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,472
We also got Vincent
Parr's blood tests back.

786
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,266
Vincent was drunk when he died.

787

Twice the legal limit.
How did you know?

788
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:26,813
Room 503. So what's behind this door?

789
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,081
What happened?

790
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,337
I couldn't hide the truth anymore.

791
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,299
The truth about what?

792
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,054
Vincent.

793
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:08,855
It's okay.

00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,466
<i>This is the fourth robbery in six months</i>

796
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,387
<i>by a bank robber authorities
have taken to calling Cowboy Bill.</i>

797
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:44,224
<i>Witnesses describe this Cowboy
Bill as being a polite man...</i>

798
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:45,475
Do you have any jacks?

799
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,435
Uh...

800
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:49,937
Go fish.

801
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,605
[reporter] <i>...pulling in $20,000.</i>

802
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,191
Hey, I'll be right back. No peeking.

803
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,819
And keep your eye out for
Cowboy Bill for me, all right?

804
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,489
Walt wants me to take Olivia.

805
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,034
Where?

806
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,077
Somewhere Children's Services

807
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,870
is less likely to show up.

808
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:14,253
The first time Vincent
hit me was four years ago.

809
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,965
I came here asking for painkillers.

810
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:22,761
I... I told the doctor I'd
been in a bicycle accident.

811
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,680
What really happened?

812
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:28,100
Well, we had gone to a holiday party

813
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,519
for the high school staff.

814
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,773
I drank too much wine.

815
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:37,318
And I bumped into the vice principal,

816
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,612
and I caused her to spill something.

817
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,949
It's not that huge of a deal.

818
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:46,994
Right?

819
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:56,044
When we got home,
Vincent... completely lost it.

820
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:59,048
And I ended up with a broken collarbone.

821
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:02,343
Had he ever hit you before?

822
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,929
No, he changed after he got that job.

823
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,684
- Why?
- I think it was because of his father.

824
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:14,647
When Vincent was growing up,
his dad drank himself

825
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,065
right out of a job and their family...

826
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,027
right out of their house.

827
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,489
So, Vincent was not
gonna let that happen.

828
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,452
So, no matter how much he drank,
he always wanted to, you know,

829
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:32,498
have the appearance of an upstanding
family man and a good provider.

830
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:37,169
And he would just lose it when he
thought I was jeopardizing that.

831
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,633
Did Vincent hit Olivia, as well?

832
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,968
[Melissa] No.

833
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,763
No, if he ever would've laid
a hand on our baby girl,

834
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:50,683
I would have gotten her out of there.
I would've done the right thing.

835
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,019
Is that why you went out
driving last night?

836
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:54,521
To do the right thing?

837
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,732
When Vincent and Olivia
didn't come home, I got scared.

838
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,944
I knew Vincent was lying
about where he was.

839
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,030
You knew he was at the casino?

840
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,491
I knew he'd been drinking,

841
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,659
'cause I could hear it in his voice.

842
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,453
Probably the Rusty Lantern.

843
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,038
Did Vincent often take your ten-year-old

844
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:15,417
with him when he'd go drinking?

845
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,799
He said leaving her in the car was safer

846
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,926
than leaving her with me because...

847
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,306
I was an unfit mother.

848
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:36,771
But when he called drunk and
then they didn't come home...

849
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:39,399
I didn't care.

850
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,984
I knew I shouldn't be driving, but...

851
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:48,281
All I could think about
was Olivia in some wreck.

852
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,536
It's been a nightmare.

853
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:58,501
Did you run your husband
over to end that nightmare?

854
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,837
[breathes deeply]

855
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:06,509
I don't know what I did last night.

856
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,149
[knock on door]

857
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,654
Come in.

858
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,616
Did we have a meeting scheduled?

859
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,703
N-No, no. I was just coming
to tell you that I found

860
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:35,830
some decent office space on the Res.

861
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,581
I mean, it's gonna need a lot of work

862
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,332
before it can open, but...

863
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,547
I have a good handyman for you.

864
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:49,844
A gentleman named Sam Poteet.

865
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,345
Actually, I can take care
of the repairs myself.

866
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,149
But it was your idea
to visibly demonstrate

867
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,518
how the money's being
reinvested on the Res.

868
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,701
Don't you think hiring a member
of the tribe will help with that?

869
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,397
Not if it's a waste of money.

870
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,157
Mr. Poteet...

871
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:16,287
is both highly dependable...

872
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,333
and highly efficient.

873
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,007
Are you threatening me?

874
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:32,469
In Cheyenne culture,
the most prized dowry

875
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:35,931
a groom can offer his new
bride's father is a rifle.

876
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,644
There's a reason for this tradition.

877
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,520
Do you know what it is?

878
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,147
No, clearly.

879
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:48,401
The idea is that you
never arm your enemy.

880
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:53,825
You're making a deep and, dare I say,

881
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:57,704
courageous commitment to this tribe.

882
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:01,206
The rifle is a symbol of my trust.

883
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,044
Take it.

884
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,634
Thank you.

885
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:19,141
And for those times when
symbols don't suffice...

886
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,603
you should have these, as well.

887
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,030
[horn honks]

888
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,326
[Vic] Hey.

889
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,080
Bartender confirms that Vincent was

890
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:44,249
in here for about an hour last night.
He had four beers and four shots.

891
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,711
Eight drinks in an hour? Jesus.

892
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,779
Cashier at the minimart said
that Olivia did come in there.

893
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,591
She got a sandwich and some Skittles,

894
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,260
and she crossed back over
and got into a royal blue sedan.

895
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,804
Right.

896
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,264
[Vic] <i>So, Vincent Parr leaves</i>

897
00:50:58,347 --> 00:51:00,266
<i>the Rusty Lantern around 9:00 p.m.</i>

898
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,893
It's a 30-minute drive
from there to the casino,

899
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:06,563
and he's seen entering the casino
around 9:30, leaving Olivia in the car.

900
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:11,235
Then he isn't seen again until the kid
finds him here, 20 miles from the casino.

901
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,911
So, if Melissa killed Vincent,

902
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,455
how'd she get his body from the
casino all the way out there?

903
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,709
She said she didn't even know
that he was at the casino.

904
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:29,712
So, she's lying or just confused.

905
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,340
Let's take Malachi at his
word that Vincent Parr

906
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:35,843
never made it inside
the casino last night.

907
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:44,769
[sighs]

908
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:52,234
So, that would mean whatever happened,
happened out here.

909
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,539
From here, you can see everything.

910
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:12,254
Is this where Olivia was
sitting when Cady found her?

911
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,342
It is.

912
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,136
So, then if Melissa picked up Vincent,

913
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,179
or Malachi's guys mugged him...

914
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,850
His daughter saw it.

915
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,984
I need to go talk to Olivia.

916
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,154
[sighs]

917
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,120
Probably should get Vincent's
car back to the family.

918
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,247
Do you have the keys?
I can drive it over there.

919
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,337
I think we need to call a tow truck.

920
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,482
Thanks, Ferg.

921
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,486
How are you feeling?

922
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,904
Terrible.

923
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,950
But they gave me some Pedialyte,
which is helping.

924
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,789
Where's Olivia?

925
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:30,707
She's here. She's in good hands.

926
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:35,045
I'm afraid to even ask this, but...

927
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,590
but what did you find
out about last night?

928
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,760
Whatever happened to Vincent,

929
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:45,139
I think your daughter saw it
and she's afraid to talk.

930
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,059
Because she saw me?

931
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,645
I don't know yet.

932
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:02,031
Dad picked me up from school,
and we went to get dinner.

933
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,115
Where?

934
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,950
[Olivia] The gas station.

935
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,120
I got a sandwich and some Skittles.

936
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,705
I ate in the car.

937
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,540
Outside the bar?

938
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:14,626
Yeah.

939
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,629
I waited while Dad went inside.

940
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:19,173
Then we drove to the casino.

941
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,716
What happened when you
got to the casino?

942
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,511
Dad went inside, like I said.

943
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,762
And that's the truth?

944
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:32,519
Olivia, darling, you need
to tell the sheriff the truth.

945
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,730
Even if it puts me in a bad light,

946
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,734
you need to tell him what happened,
no matter what I did.

947
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,864
The sheriff already
knows that Dad hit me.

948
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:50,203
When your dad went into the casino
last night, did anybody stop him?

949
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,333
I got some photos.

950
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,050
Was it this man?

951
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,637
No?

952
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,141
How about this one?

953
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:13,852
From the other night.

954
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:18,731
Okay.

955
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:25,114
Olivia, um, did you see your mother
outside the casino last night?

956
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,077
It's okay.

957
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,914
We're gonna tell the truth now,
no matter what.

958
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,333
No more secrets.

959
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,631
No.

960
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,135
Mom wasn't at the casino last night.

961
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,137
Okay.

962
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,267
So who did you see with your dad?

963
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,522
You didn't see anybody, did you?

964
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,693
Because your dad was never
at the casino last night.

965
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,072
What are you talking about?

966
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:10,617
Olivia, could you empty
out your pockets for me?

967
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,369
[dramatic music playing]

968
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,129
Everything, please.

969
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:24,798
[dramatic music playing]

970
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:47,154
I found these on the
driver's side floor.

971
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:51,741
I never found your dad's car keys.

972
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:55,120
That's because he gave
them to you, isn't it?

973
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:59,708
You were your dad's designated driver.

974
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,711
No, but O-Olivia can't drive.

975
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:03,920
She's ten.

976
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:05,422
Dad taught me.

977
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:11,887
So he wouldn't get a
DUI and lose his job.

978
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:19,394
But if you drove him to the casino,

979
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:21,647
how'd they find his body out by the bar?

980
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:27,736
Because Olivia...
didn't drive Vincent to the casino.

981
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,488
He was never there last night.

982
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,657
There's no footage of him on the inside.

983
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,077
And if he'd been stopped outside

984
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,580
by you or anyone,
somebody would've seen it.

985
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:45,170
Olivia, what happened to your dad

986
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:48,132
on the drive between the
bar and the casino?

987
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,304
One of my dreams happened.

988
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:56,806
What?

989
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:00,269
I used to dream about
somebody coming to rescue us.

990
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,232
So that you could go to the
doctor and get better.

991
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,737
I dreamed up all the ways
that Dad could disappear.

992
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,200
And one of your dreams
turned real last night?

993
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:23,334
[Olivia] When I was driving from the bar,
Dad called Mom to say we were coming home.

994
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,879
Then he fell asleep with
his head against the door.

995
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:30,424
It was dark.

996
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,176
There wasn't anyone else on the road.

997
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:37,389
So I pulled the car over,
put the handle in "P"

998
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:42,685
like Dad showed me, and I came
around and opened his door.

999
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:46,023
Dad fell out without waking up.

1000
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,820
So I closed the door, got back inside.

1001
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,615
Then I put the handle in "R".

1002
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,079
And the car went backward over him.

1003
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,459
Then I put it in "D"...

1004
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:12,508
and drove to the casino and
waited for someone to see me.

1005
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,803
[Melissa crying]

1006
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:19,722
Mom.

1007
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,600
Don't be sad.

1008
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,353
Dad's gone now.

1009
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:28,648
You can go to the doctor and get better.

1010
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,194
[sobbing lightly]

1011
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,821
[Olivia] It's all gonna be okay.

1012
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:40,077
[crying]

1013
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:56,510
[knock on door]

1014
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,182
[sighs]

1015
01:00:04,393 --> 01:00:06,228
Oh, good, you're, uh... you're still up.

1016
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,938
Yeah, I was just
puttering around the house.

1017
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,232
- Come in.
- Oh, yeah.

1018
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:14,736
[sighs]

1019
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,947
Uh...

1020
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,450
This is for you.

1021
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:20,784
[Donna] Oh.

1022
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:23,537
- Is it a gift?
- It's laundry.

1023
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,039
Ah, every girl's dream.

1024
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:27,749
Yeah.

1025
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:28,917
Uh, I'll get you a beer.

1026
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,669
Yeah.

1027
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:37,384
So, uh... I finally called
Children's Services.

1028
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,721
So does that mean that the
mother killed the girl's father?

1029
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:44,183
No, it was the girl actually,
to protect the mother.

1030
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:48,145
She'll be evaluated and
go into counseling, um...

1031
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:49,855
while the mom rehabilitates, but...

1032
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,232
she won't be charged.

1033
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,817
- She's too young.
- Yeah.

1034
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:55,944
Yeah.

1035
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,487
This world will surprise you.

1036
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:00,449
Yep.

1037
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,914
I'm pregnant.

1038
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:11,460
Pregnant?

1039
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:16,047
- Aren't you a little, um...
- Be really careful.

1040
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,134
Aren't we both a little...
autumnal for that?

1041
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,888
Well, surprise.

1042
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:23,889
Yeah.

1043
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:27,184
I guess we should make it official.

1044
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,645
- And get married.
- It's the right thing to do.

1045
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:32,649
There's... there's room here,
plenty of space...

1046
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:35,942
For God sakes, Walt, I am not pregnant.

1047
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:39,029
- But you just said that you were pregnant.
- No, I know what I said.

1048
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,198
I said it to make a point.

1049
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,116
That you're a very convincing liar?

1050
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,870
No, to make that point that if
I were pregnant, you would be

1051
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:49,998
the sort of guy who would just immediately
ask me to marry him, you know?

1052
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:53,167
Even though... even thought that's...
that's not what you want.

1053
01:01:53,252 --> 01:01:54,295
I never said that.

1054
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:55,920
You don't have to.

1055
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,842
Look, I know you like me.

1056
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:04,387
And I like you... a lot, actually.

1057
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:09,183
But what I don't want is for you to feel
obligated to be in a relationship with me

1058
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:11,270
because now, suddenly,
after the attack, you know,

1059
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:13,230
it's... it's the right
thing to do, okay?

1060
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:16,358
I just... I don't feel
like pity and obligation

1061
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,819
are ideal foundations
for a romance, so...

1062
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,363
All right.

1063
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,824
How about clean laundry?

1064
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,746
And a... an enduring
perplexity about existence?

1065
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:31,956
[chuckles]

1066
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,462
Well, I guess there are some
romances built on worse, right?

1067
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:37,713
[Walt] Yeah.

1068
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:40,341
You want to sit?

1069
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,593
Yeah.

1070
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,181
[soft music playing]

1071
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,933
[both sigh]

1072
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:57,858
Speaking of perplexity, do you actually
know how a woman gets pregnant?

1073
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:02,028
Well, um...

1074
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,615
I think I may have read
about that somewhere.

1075
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,243
So, why would you think
that I was, you know...

1076
01:03:09,328 --> 01:03:10,454
What do you mean?

1077
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,540
Didn't we, um...?

1078
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:16,793
You don't remember?

1079
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:19,629
I got hit in the head.

1080
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:26,845
So did we?

1081
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:33,477
Well...

1082
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:38,399
I guess every great romance
deserves a little mystery.
