a certain ethereal charm

661
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:25,004
to descend such a staircase
on the arm

662
00:41:25,038 --> 00:41:26,339
of a handsome man.

663
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:27,976
At least, that has been
my experience.

664
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:31,811
Hmm, well, then you will have
to build a ballroom.

665
00:41:31,846 --> 00:41:33,312
And I will have to learn
to dance

666
00:41:33,347 --> 00:41:36,116
something
other than the Horny Toad Stomp.

667
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:39,352
[Laughs] Yes, indeed, Maggie.

668
00:41:39,387 --> 00:41:42,654
Although I suspect
the Horny Toad Stomp

669
00:41:42,688 --> 00:41:44,757
is not without its charms.

670
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:47,492
[Chuckles]

671
00:41:47,526 --> 00:41:53,527
[Bird chirping]

672
00:43:21,628 --> 00:43:25,107
