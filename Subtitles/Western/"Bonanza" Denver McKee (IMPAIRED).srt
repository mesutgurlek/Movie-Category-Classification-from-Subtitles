00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:05,338
ANNOUNCER:
<i>The following program</i>

2
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:08,842
<i>is brought to you</i>
<i>in living color on NBC.</i>

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,004
(fanfare playing)

4
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:30,897
Oh, you two are a big help.

5
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:32,866
Here I had
that gal sweet-talked,

6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,434
eating right out of my hand,

7
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,537
you two have to bust in
and hustle me out of there.

8
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,772
Well, you just be grateful

9
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,240
we got you out of trouble
before it happened.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,674
Yeah.
Well, you know what I think?

11
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,777
Well, it couldn't be much;
it takes brains to think.

12
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,413
Yeah, well,
I think you're jealous.

13
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,449
Just 'cause I find
the only pretty gal in town

14
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,718
who's not wearing
some man's brand.

15
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,987
Didn't I tell you
he's short on brains?

16
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,223
Ah, but she <i>was</i> wearing
some man's brand, Casanova,

17
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,526
and he was rounding up
a few of his friends,

18
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,361
and they were fixin'
to take you apart.

19
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,863
But there was no talk about
putting you back together again.

20
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,399
HOSS: And me and Adam being
the charitable fellers we are,

21
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,601
we just decided your hide
might be worth saving.

22
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,305
Uh, not that we care, but, uh,
Pa might've been a little upset.

23
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,374
(distant gunshot)

24
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,809
That was a.45.

25
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,244
Sounds like it came
from old Pete Redfern's place.

26
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,113
Nah, he don't own no.45.

27
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,741
Hyah.

28
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,115
(horses approaching)

29
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,564
(breathing weakly)

30
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,666
HOSS:
Pete.

31
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,669
(weakly):
They got everything.

32
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,971
Three years' work gone.

33
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,440
Pete... did you get
a good look at 'em?

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,433
(groans)
They was wearing masks.

35
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:55,248
One of 'em was a big... redhead.

36
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:56,683
A redheaded man?

37
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,952
(groans)

38
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,955
Hat fell off.

39
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,291
There was... four of 'em.

40
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,693
Pete... don't you worry,

41
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,429
we're gonna get a doctor
for you out of Virginia City.

42
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,658
LITTLE JOE:
How is he?

43
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,108
He's just fine.

44
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,272
Ol' Pete ain't hurtin' no more.

45
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,808
(theme song playing)

46
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,838
Hello, Miles.

47
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,740
Ah, morning, Mr. Cartwright.

48
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,242
Denver around?

49
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,077
Yeah, inside.

50
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,513
Walkin' about
six foot off the ground.

51
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,846
Nervous as a rustler in church.

52
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,420
He hasn't had this buggy out
since that schoolteacher left.

53
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,255
Now, don't tell me
he's gettin' married.

54
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,924
No! Ain't gonna get married;
don't have to.

55
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,927
Gonna have a woman
around the place again.

56
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,596
- Connie's coming home?!
- Yep.

57
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,964
By golly! Ha-ha!

58
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,432
- 4:00 stage.
- Yeah?

59
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:55,101
I tell you, Mr. Cartwright,
that man's scared to death.

60
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,603
(Ben laughs)

61
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,472
And I reckon since she's been
back to that Eastern school

62
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,375
going on four years, he figures
she's the queen of England.

63
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,043
(both laugh)

64
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:07,413
Well, you know, she's gonna see
a lot of changes in this place.

65
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,781
Yeah, Denver's done a good job
with it in four years.

66
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,090
Well, for the love
of Zachary P. Taylor.

67
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,458
That you, Denver?

68
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,791
Yeah. That's me, Denver.

69
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,701
Where are you preaching?

70
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,702
Nowhere.

71
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,170
But I wish I was.

72
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:35,141
Behind a pulpit, I could
take off these doggone gaiters.

73
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,643
(Ben chuckles)

74
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,079
Ben, do you think
a man's feet keep on growing?

75
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,949
Well, I've heard that, uh,
when a person gets older

76
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,451
his body shrinks--
I don't know about feet, though.

77
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,755
Well, I haven't had these gaiters
on since the Haroldson wedding,

78
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,090
but I swear, either
they're a size smaller

79
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,192
or my feet are a size larger.

80
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,194
(Ben chuckles)

81
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,929
Ben, you think I look all right?

82
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,898
Well, you know,
if I didn't know better,

83
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,733
I'd swear you were a senator.

84
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,136
- I'm going in to meet Connie!
- I know! I know!

85
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,038
- Did Miles tell you?
- Yeah, he told me.

86
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,839
Sure I told him.

87
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,075
I ain't forgot how to talk.

88
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,977
Doesn't seem like
four years, does it?

89
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,211
It does to me.

90
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,380
I tried to get
the house fixed up

91
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,916
so Connie'd have a decent place
to come home to.

92
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,918
I don't know...
you think she'll like it?

93
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,153
Oh, looks real nice.

94
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,021
I had some new curtains made
for her room.

95
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,790
- Yeah?
- Some kind of lace.

96
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,558
Uh, uh, they're
real pretty to me.

97
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,060
Well, then it is real pretty.

98
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,528
Eh, what are you worried about?

99
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,530
That little girl
won't even know the place.

100
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,965
I know, I know.
But she's grown up now.

101
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,634
18 her last birthday.

102
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,569
You make it sound
like she's an old maid.

103
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,237
When she left here,
she was a kid.

104
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,206
What do you know about it,
you old goat?

105
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,541
Who's an old goat?

106
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,309
I ain't more than
two years older than you are.

107
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,011
That makes you an old goat.

108
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,813
For two cents, I'd quit.

109
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,214
For two cents, I'd fire you.

110
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,349
Now, hold on, you two.

111
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,950
How long have
you known each other?

112
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,585
Too dang long.

113
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,887
Since before Connie was born--
that's long enough.

114
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,458
Well, Denver, if I were you, I'd
hold on to Miles as a foreman.

115
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,127
You give me one good reason
why I should.

116
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:05,064
Well, if you don't,
Connie'll have your hide.

117
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,700
(Miles chuckles)

118
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,035
(Ben chuckles)

119
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,703
Hey, you better
get going, Denver.

120
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,538
That stage is liable
to be early.

121
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:16,142
Well, it hasn't happened yet,
but I suppose it could.

122
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,278
Ben, you wouldn't want
to ride in with me, would you?

123
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,315
Well, no, you... you two
have a lot to talk about.

124
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,183
Yeah, I guess you're right.

125
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,986
- Four years is a long time.
- Yeah.

126
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,355
Well, you sure
I look all right, Ben?

127
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,758
- I told you!
- Yeah, like a senator.

128
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,093
Ben, you can't lie worth a hoot.

129
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,261
(laughs)

130
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,496
Well, then, uh...

131
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,294
like a state senator, then.

132
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,300
Oh, there is one thing.

133
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,502
Yeah, what's that?

134
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,103
Well, I was thinking...

135
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,872
it's a little
short notice, I know,

136
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,441
but this is Saturday night,
and, uh, Connie coming home,

137
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,210
I thought I'd like to give
a little welcome home party

138
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,879
for Connie at
the Ponderosa tonight.

139
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,213
Well, that's fine, Ben.

140
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,216
If I can get these gaiters
broke in by that time.

141
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,319
Well, if you want to,
you can come barefoot.

142
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,321
- Thanks, Ben.
- (Ben laughs)

143
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,313
Connie'll like a party.

144
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,395
Well, I guess
I'd better get along home

145
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,957
and have the boys spread
the word around about the party.

146
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:18,704
Oh, I, uh, won't be able to make
the party, Mr. Cartwright.

147
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,506
Somebody's got
to watch the store.

148
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,839
Aw, sorry about that, Miles.

149
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,051
HOSS:
That's all we found on him, Pa.

150
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,987
We followed the four men
till we lost their trail,

151
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,857
then we went back
and buried Pete.

152
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:42,328
Not very much to leave after
a lifetime of hard work, is it?

153
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:45,698
What could anybody expect to get
robbing old Pete Redfern?

154
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,467
Well, I don't know, Adam.

155
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,369
Some people said Pete did fairly
well with that mine of his.

156
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,538
He could've had some money
stashed away somewhere.

157
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,507
Pa, this seems to me
like it's a...

158
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,775
like it's an organized outfit.

159
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:58,077
This is the third robbery
in less than a month.

160
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,979
Now it's the first killing.

161
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,349
Pete was killed because he got
a good look at one of the men.

162
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,984
Oh, that so?

163
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,352
What'd he say about him?

164
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,151
Well, not much, except--
except he had red hair.

165
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,191
Hmm.

166
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,960
Well, I'll talk
to Denver McKee.

167
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,262
He might be able to pick up
the trail you boys lost.

168
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,930
Yeah, he...
probably could at that.

169
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,132
Old Denver's about half
bloodhound anyhow.

170
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,868
Well, meantime, you go ahead

171
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,203
and pass the word
around about the party.

172
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:28,841
I don't think Pete would want
to spoil Connie's homecoming.

173
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,409
You keep quiet about this.

174
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,711
I'll talk to Denver.

175
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,441
Right, Pa.

176
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,183
(door closes)

177
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,035
(sniffs)

178
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,237
Hey, is that you I smell,
little brother?

179
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,306
Well, it couldn't be
you or Adam.

180
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,641
You two smell like horses.

181
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,109
(sniffs)

182
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,511
Smells a bit like the Wednesday
Afternoon Ladies' Society,

183
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,779
don't you think?

184
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,381
Yeah, or maybe-maybe Walsh's
livery stable.

185
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,316
Hey, will you fellas
take a long walk?

186
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,617
Like, to China?

187
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:13,119
Well, now, little brother,
we'd be happy to,

188
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,253
but we gotta
hang around here a little--

189
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,688
take care of your hide.

190
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,558
Well, I'll tell Connie McKee
to be sure to thank you.

191
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,227
Oh, uh, Joe, uh... remember,
don't mention anything

192
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,262
about Pete Redfern
at the party, okay?

193
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,630
Yeah, right.

194
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,865
Did he have any kin?

195
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,166
No, no.

196
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,268
According to Pa, his wife died
a few years back

197
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,571
and that's how come
he's out here mining.

198
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,872
Hmm. Well, you boys see

199
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,674
a redheaded man
at the party tonight,

200
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,676
be sure to shoot first
and talk about it later.

201
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:37,910
Hey, wait a minute.

202
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,612
Josh Perkins is coming
to that party tonight.

203
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,882
He's redheaded and the best dang
barber in Virginia City.

204
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,850
I sure wouldn't want
to shoot him.

205
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,719
Well, you know, I would
if I were you.

206
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,178
Look at the haircut
they gave him.

207
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,700
(playing "My Bonnie")

208
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,225
Here you are, Charlie.

209
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,174
Wonder what's keeping
Denver McKee

210
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,609
and that daughter of his.
They're late.

211
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,910
Now, listen, Fleming,

212
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,212
have you ever taken a woman
anywhere and be on time?

213
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,480
Little Connie McKee.

214
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,215
You know, the way she used
to ride that horse,

215
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,483
I thought she'd break her neck

216
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,318
before she got a chance
to go to school.

217
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,687
Wonder whether she changed the
East or the East changed her.

218
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,923
I guess the East rubbed some
rough spots out of her,

219
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:25,891
but I imagine she's still
the same girl she was.

220
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,460
Least I hope so,
for Denver's sake.

221
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,761
He was shaking like a leaf

222
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,763
when he went to pick her up
at the stage.

223
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,299
Here's to Denver McKee.

224
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,334
The greatest sheriff Colorado
ever had.

225
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,569
Here's to Denver McKee.

226
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,471
The best Indian scout
in the U.S. Army.

227
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,973
Here's to Denver McKee.

228
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,703
The most frightened father
in Nevada.

229
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,277
(horse approaching)

230
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,336
Ah, there they come.

231
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,456
It's got to be Connie 'cause
she's with old Denver.

232
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,758
I don't know.

233
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,226
It don't look like
Connie to me.

234
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,998
You want to know
something, fellas?

235
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,660
I don't really care
who that is.

236
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,169
Welcome home, Connie.

237
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,405
Hello, Little Joe.
It's so nice to see you.

238
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,673
Hey, wait a minute.

239
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,199
Is that the way to say hello
to an old friend?

240
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,116
In the East, that's the way
we treat fresh men.

241
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,985
Looks like you two
are going to take up

242
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,154
just where you left off
four years ago--still fighting.

243
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,456
Hello, Hoss.
It's so good to see you.

244
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,624
Hi, Connie.

245
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,492
Doggone it, we like to not even
recognized you.

246
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,593
You wait right here.

247
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,761
We got a real big
surprise for you.

248
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,796
All right.

249
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,431
Adam, how are you?

250
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,733
Well, Connie, you have changed.

251
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,168
Not so you could notice.

252
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,236
You still got
that same old sweet temper.

253
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,404
Hello. How are you?

254
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,505
Welcome home, Connie.

255
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,740
Thank you.

256
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,642
I didn't expect
a welcome home party like this.

257
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,377
It's so wonderful.

258
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,679
Oh, I'd forgotten
how beautiful the Ponderosa is.

259
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,082
Well, she put on
her best party dress for you.

260
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:57,683
Denver, she's your daughter--

261
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,251
you'd better introduce her
to the guests.

262
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,153
Thanks, Ben.

263
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,490
Folks, most of you remember
my little girl,

264
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,160
but for those who don't,
Connie McKee.

265
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,095
- Welcome home. -Good to see ya.
- Welcome home, honey.

266
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:20,072
(festive accordion music plays,
guest converse)

267
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:20,940
Oh, it's beautiful!

268
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,109
But it's a shame to cut it.

269
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,177
Well, we can't eat it
till you do.

270
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,578
Yeah, just make a wish first,
and then blow.

271
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,908
(laughing and cheering)

272
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,454
She's a real beauty, Denver.

273
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,456
She sure is, Ben.

274
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,726
I can say that 'cause I can't
take any credit for it.

275
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,561
She's the spitting image
of her mother.

276
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,029
Yeah.

277
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,664
I only hope I've done right.

278
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,199
About what?

279
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,367
Connie.

280
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,302
How do you know
about girls, Ben?

281
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,038
You see, I didn't want her
to grow up here

282
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,273
like a wild bronco,

283
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,375
marry the first saddle tramp
that asked her.

284
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,843
Oh.

285
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,446
Or get tired of the ranch
and head for San Francisco

286
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,414
to twist the town by the tail.

287
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,151
I wanted to give her
what you've given your boys--

288
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,520
security, background.

289
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,455
I want her to have a chance

290
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,859
to see something besides steers
and horses and a kitchen stove.

291
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,129
Well, you've done it.

292
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,899
And I know it hasn't been easy.

293
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,468
Thank you.

294
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,937
Here's a little peace offering.
Why don't we call it a truce?

295
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,106
Well, seeing as
you started the war, I accept.

296
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,407
There'll be another war,
Little Joe,

297
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,309
if you try to hog
the guest of honor.

298
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,877
Uh, Connie, why don't
we go somewhere

299
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,679
where we can draw up
a peace treaty?

300
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,815
I have a better idea:
Let's have some punch.

301
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,851
Hey, that is a good idea.
Why don't you two go ahead?

302
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,119
Well, come on, fellas.

303
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,620
Connie and I are old friends.

304
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,323
But Connie wants to make
new friends, don't you, Connie?

305
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,558
Since you've been East,

306
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,059
Little Joe's a changed man,
Connie.

307
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,628
He doesn't seem any different
to me.

308
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,463
CLANCY:
That's just on the surface.

309
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,333
Underneath, he's wilder than
a locoed steer, right, Mort?

310
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,035
MORT:
Wilder, some times.

311
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,903
In Virginia City,
they have what they call

312
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,505
the Girls Protective
Association.

313
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,509
When Little Joe comes into town,
all those mamas go into action.

314
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,511
Why, Little Joe, I had no idea!

315
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,414
Miss Connie, would you care
to meet some of my friends?

316
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,715
Yes, I'd love to.

317
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,707
Oh, Connie, I...

318
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:17,623
I hope she isn't really mad
at Little Joe.

319
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,992
Oh, no,
she's not mad at Joe.

320
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,562
She's trying to show him that
he isn't the only man in Nevada.

321
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,724
Do him good.

322
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,303
What's the matter,
little brother?

323
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,805
You having trouble?

324
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,274
She acts like I got
typhoid fever or something.

325
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,042
What's the matter
with me, anyway?

326
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,078
Uh, got a couple hours,
I'll tell you.

327
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,246
(Hoss chuckles)

328
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,513
Ah, never mind.

329
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,215
She's not the only girl
in Nevada.

330
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,684
Mm, but she's the prettiest.

331
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,923
Oh, come on.

332
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,458
You're not gonna really eat
the rest of that?

333
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,027
Hmm. It's too good a cake
to let go to waste, Joe.

334
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,731
Thanks so much for everything,
all of you.

335
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,757
That even includes you,
Little Joe.

336
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,637
DENVER:
Thanks, Ben.

337
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,005
For a while there tonight,

338
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,032
you made me forget
Connie'd ever been away at all.

339
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,489
Well, the short straw stays,
the rest of us get Denver,

340
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,425
see if we can pick up
the trail of the killers.

341
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,195
Well... guess who's got it.

342
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,264
Guess you stay, Joe.

343
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,899
LITTLE JOE:
Shoot.

344
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,535
Well, I still don't see
why we all can't go.

345
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,137
Well, somebody has to stay here.

346
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,273
Make yourself useful, Joe.

347
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,175
Help number-one cousin
with the dishes.

348
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,167
(Ben laughs)

349
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,643
(gunshot)

350
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,982
(two gunshots)

351
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,962
Uh, that's pretty good shooting
there, Denver.

352
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,497
A useless way
to spend money, Ben.

353
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,834
I just started wondering
if I still had the touch.

354
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,936
Well, I guess
it's a little like swimming--

355
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,171
a man never forgets.

356
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,039
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

357
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,607
I guess we better get started.

358
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,042
Get started where?

359
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:20,579
Connie, I didn't want you
to be bothered with any of this,

360
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,348
but you see, yesterday,

361
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,684
an old prospector
named Pete Redfern got killed,

362
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,553
his life savings stolen.

363
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,154
Oh, that's terrible!

364
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,823
Well, it's more than that.

365
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,858
Last night, two men got killed,

366
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,394
and the Silverado Mine payroll
was taken.

367
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,329
We're just going out,
scout around,

368
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,931
see what we can find out.

369
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,799
I see.

370
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,268
But why do you have to go?

371
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,037
But Connie, I just told you.

372
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:47,272
Three men have been killed.

373
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:50,542
I'd almost forgotten
about the violence in the West.

374
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,578
And the fact
that nobody is immune

375
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,880
or wants to be.

376
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,449
Well, we mean to try
to put a stop to this

377
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:58,717
before there's
any further violence.

378
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,452
Do you?

379
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,221
Or do you enjoy it?

380
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:06,358
No, we're just trying to do
what we feel we have to do.

381
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,028
Well, leave my dad out of it.

382
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,764
He spent most of his life
with violence.

383
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,365
It wasn't a game with him.

384
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,801
It was his business,
and he retired.

385
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,369
Can't you leave him alone?

386
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,239
Connie, these are neighbors
asking me to help

387
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,207
because I know
about these things.

388
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,978
Connie, last year,
200 head of steer vanished,

389
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,080
completely, without a trace...

390
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,315
and 50 men couldn't find them.

391
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,885
Now we're looking for four men.

392
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,321
Now, the sheriff needs
all the help he can get.

393
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:40,259
Now, if we find the men,
and I hope we do...

394
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,294
well... (sighs)

395
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,363
...it's not gonna make us
feel good,

396
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:49,068
or not gonna make us feel big
and brave.

397
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,970
That's right, Connie.

398
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,706
None of us get any joy
out of this.

399
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,301
Just something
that has to be done.

400
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,246
I'm sorry, Mr. Cartwright.

401
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,444
You will be careful,
won't you, Dad?

402
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,611
I didn't get this old
being careless.

403
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,385
(Connie sighs)

404
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,899
Connie, you try not
to think about it.

405
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,136
Where'd you leave Little Joe--
back at the Ponderosa?

406
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,238
Oh, he's got a few chores to do.

407
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,806
Uh, not too many.

408
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,142
Nice day for a ride.

409
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:33,178
If Little Joe wants to see me,
he knows where I am.

410
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,881
The only trouble is,
he can't leave the ranch.

411
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,950
Well, let him stay there.

412
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,079
I certainly have no intention
of running after him.

413
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,258
Hyah. Hyah...

414
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,284
Hyah. Hyah.

415
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,102
Oh, you're late.

416
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,937
Don't tell me
you were expecting me.

417
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,406
Oh, Pa didn't tell you
I had to stay here

418
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:03,709
and do a few things
around the house, huh?

419
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,078
I really don't remember,
because I really don't care.

420
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,980
Oh.

421
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,481
Well, in that case, you probably
wouldn't be very interested

422
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,884
in a little present
I was fixing up for you.

423
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,585
- A present for me?
- Mm-hmm.

424
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,487
Yet if you don't care,

425
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,389
there really isn't
much point to it.

426
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,857
Did I say that?

427
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,192
Yeah, well, didn't you?

428
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,426
Well, I may have,

429
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,562
but that was before
you mentioned a present.

430
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,030
Oh.

431
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,532
Well, they really
taught you a lot

432
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,833
in that girls school
back East.

433
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,835
How to be mercenary
in one easy lesson.

434
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,037
You're so wrong, Little Joe.

435
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,873
No woman alive needs
that lesson.

436
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,842
She's born that way.

437
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,278
Oh, I just didn't know
they admitted to it.

438
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,270
But since you did...

439
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,712
How do you like him?

440
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,617
Oh, Little Joe,
he's beautiful!

441
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,725
If that's the way
you say thanks,

442
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,893
it'll just take me a second

443
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,628
to rustle up about a dozen more
just like him.

444
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,130
Never mind.

445
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,399
One beautiful horse
like this is enough for anybody.

446
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,167
Maybe so,
but I don't hardly think

447
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,762
one kiss is enough for anybody.

448
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,472
Why, Little Joe,

449
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,175
I thought you had to stay back
at the ranch.

450
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,310
Not when I have something
better to do,

451
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,246
like, uh, kissing my best girl.

452
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,915
You mean, kissing girls,
don't you?

453
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,483
Any girl?

454
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,586
Well, now, where in the world
did you get that notion?

455
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,054
It wasn't hard.

456
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,522
Almost everyone
at the party last night

457
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,258
volunteered that information.

458
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,525
And more.

459
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,094
Oh, you're not
gonna believe them.

460
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,462
Well, why shouldn't I?

461
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,130
Because they're lying.

462
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,967
You mean there's no such girl
as, uh, Joan Curry?

463
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,137
Oh, sure there's such a girl
as Joan, but she's a...

464
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:16,475
And, uh, how about,
uh, Carol Childress,

465
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,411
and Judy Polk
and, uh, Sally Putnam?

466
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,048
How do you do it?

467
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,516
You haven't been back 24 hours,

468
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,685
and you know every girl
I've ever talked to.

469
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,487
I have only mentioned four.

470
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,623
Would you like me to tell you
the rest of the list?

471
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,025
No, never mind.

472
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,926
Of course, uh,
you didn't do anything

473
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,529
when you were back East,
except maybe knit socks.

474
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,399
Oh, you know very well
I went to a girls school.

475
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,768
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
only the way I heard it,

476
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,570
there was a boys school
right down block.

477
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,072
How long is your list?

478
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,375
You'll die wondering,
Little Joe.

479
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,477
Look, Connie, those girls
didn't mean anything to me.

480
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,646
They... They were just...

481
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,214
Girls?

482
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,883
Yeah, that's right;
they were just girls.

483
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:01,586
Well, that's exactly
what I am--a girl.

484
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,555
Mm-mm.

485
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,820
No, you're a very special girl.

486
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,399
Connie...

487
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,902
there was something
I wanted to ask you.

488
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,670
Are you going back east?

489
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,672
Well, I'm not sure. Why?

490
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,608
Well, just don't want you
to go back, that's all.

491
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,744
Well, that's hardly
reason enough.

492
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,746
Because I think
you're very beautiful.

493
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,314
That still isn't much of a...

494
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,749
Because I like you very much.

495
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,253
I've only been back
for 24 hours, Little Joe.

496
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,127
Tell me the same thing
in 24 days.

497
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,957
Now if we cut across
the rimrock,

498
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:14,290
we can come in
through the breaks.

499
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,898
Hi. How come you three
are back so soon?

500
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,833
We lost the trail.

501
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,034
Four horses?

502
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,870
How'd you lose a trail
like that?

503
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,405
It wasn't easy.

504
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,774
They went into the flint canyons
up near timberline.

505
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,208
Rock's so hard there,

506
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,844
you can drive a thousand head
of cattle through that part

507
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,112
and never leave a sign.

508
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,448
They got to be up here
in the Sierras somewhere.

509
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,016
Up one of those high meadows,
probably.

510
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:39,785
- They, They gotta have grass
and water. -BEN: Mm.

511
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,154
Yeah, but Adam, there must be
100 places like that up there.

512
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,256
We could ride for a year
and not find them all.

513
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,024
Or we could find them
the first day.

514
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,626
They've had
all the breaks so far.

515
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,127
It's about time we had one.

516
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,925
We'll ride out at dawn.

517
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,665
Uh, Pa?

518
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,833
Hmm?

519
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,568
I, uh... I'm sorry.

520
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,036
I can't go with you.

521
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,938
Oh?

522
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,473
You mean there's, uh...

523
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,033
There's something you prefer
to the High Sierras?

524
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,012
Well, no, it's just that, uh,

525
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,880
you see, I didn't expect
you'd be back so soon,

526
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,850
so I promised Connie
I'd take her into Virginia City.

527
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,552
Ah.

528
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,287
HOSS:
Hey, Joe,

529
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,656
ain't you afraid you might be
over-courting that little gal?

530
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,090
I mean, you keep on like this

531
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,827
and she's liable to think
you want to marry her.

532
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,362
ADAM:
Uh, Joe...

533
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:26,832
I think you ought to ride
up into the mountains with us.

534
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:29,301
It, uh... well,
there's a lot of snow up there.

535
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,570
and maybe it'd cool you off.

536
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,271
(laughs, coughs)

537
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,140
HOSS: Yeah, what-what's
your big rush anyhow, Joe?

538
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,508
You done without that little gal
for four years.

539
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,577
One more day ain't going
to hurt nothing.

540
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,412
Pa, you want me to ride
with you, I will.

541
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,813
(laughing):
No.

542
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,915
No, you go ahead
with your plans with Connie.

543
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,917
Thank you.

544
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,647
(Ben laughs)

545
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,223
You know...

546
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,924
I think our little brother's
coming down

547
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,260
with a real bad case
of love-itis.

548
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,561
Mm-hmm.

549
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,864
Never mind the love-itis;
let's get back to this.

550
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,265
Now, look, we get up
through the high meadow...

551
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,444
Pa, I'm getting about
half-tired of this canyon.

552
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,579
We must have been up here
seven or eight times.

553
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,850
I'm not only tired of the
canyon, I'm just plain tired.

554
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,719
But this is
where Denver lost the trail,

555
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,387
so this is
where we start hunting.

556
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,356
Start and finish.

557
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,825
Above here, there's a half
a mile of flint and wash rocks,

558
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:30,629
four canyons, and all the points
of the compass to choose from.

559
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,264
- Pa.
- Hmm.

560
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,899
What if they ain't
up there at all?

561
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,333
What if they just come this far

562
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,968
to make us think
they're going up there?

563
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,136
With us behind them?

564
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,771
They'd have to head
for high country.

565
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,473
Just a minute now, Adam.

566
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,008
What do you got in mind, boy?

567
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,477
Well, sir, a fox will double
back on the hound, won't it?

568
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,112
- Yeah.
- How come a man can't?

569
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:49,180
I mean, they could lead
their horses across the rocks

570
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,649
and get over
into Little Branch Canyon,

571
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,284
and go all the way
back down the valley,

572
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,820
and then leave us hunting
up here in the big country.

573
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,323
Yeah.

574
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,191
That might be just
worth looking into.

575
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,386
Come on.

576
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,409
HOSS:
Four or five horses, Pa.

577
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,401
They did double back.

578
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,022
Well, one sure way
to cover up your tracks

579
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,892
is to ride down the busiest road
you can find.

580
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,327
They did take
quite a chance, though.

581
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,895
They might have been seen.

582
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:40,465
Yeah, but I'm thinking that they
just didn't care if they were.

583
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,567
What do you mean, Pa?

584
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,070
He means that the killers
aren't strangers.

585
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,404
That's right.

586
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,973
They could afford
to double back.

587
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,174
I'm beginning to think

588
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:52,010
that they could even be
one of our neighbors.

589
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,380
(two gunshots)

590
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,748
Come on!

591
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,740
(gunshot)

592
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:10,495
You can't keep your finger
off that trigger.

593
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,831
HARLEY: Wasn't my fault
one of them saw us coming.

594
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,532
Can still be easy.

595
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,668
I'll throw enough lead
into him to keep him busy.

596
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,303
Brennan can work
around back of the cabin

597
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,101
and drop a torch on the roof.

598
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,785
(gunshot, man groans)

599
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:34,946
(gunshot, bullet ricochets)

600
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,979
(horses approaching)

601
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,853
Come on, leave it!

602
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,242
Let's go, Hoss.

603
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,234
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

604
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,314
(man groans)

605
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:05,806
Corey!

606
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,220
Here, sit on this barrel.

607
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,212
- (Corey mumbles)
- Easy.

608
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,427
Come out of nowhere.

609
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:18,697
One minute
it's quiet as a church.

610
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,799
The next minute, Jess is down

611
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,934
and bullets are whizzing

612
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,904
like bees at a swarming.

613
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,772
Did you get a look
at any of them?

614
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:32,177
Saw four of 'em,
all masked but one.

615
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,480
Hat on the,
the back of his head,

616
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,149
uh, red hair showing.

617
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,218
I never seen him before,

618
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:44,989
but I'd know him
if I ever seen him again.

619
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,058
It was no use, Pa.
They got fresh horses.

620
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,927
Ours were done when we got here.

621
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,729
What about the others, Corey?

622
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,865
Masked, like I said,
but there was one--

623
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,435
clothes, maybe,
or the way he moved.

624
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:59,070
I-I couldn't put a name to him,

625
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,174
but I, I-I swear
I've seen him a dozen times.

626
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,577
Looks like you was right about
'em being our neighbors, Pa.

627
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,112
Yeah.

628
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,413
Let's get Corey to a doctor

629
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,615
and then we'll make
a few social calls.

630
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,251
Easy, Corey.

631
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,413
Easy does it.

632
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,525
(men laughing)

633
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,642
Well, the boys seem happy.

634
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,011
How about you?

635
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,147
Don't like the way
things are going.

636
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:43,148
Why?

637
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,149
What's wrong?

638
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,617
There weren't to be no killings.

639
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,952
We decided that
when we started all this.

640
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,155
Look, when you point
a gun at a man,

641
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:53,324
sometimes he has
to go for his own.

642
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,861
When that happens, you just
got to pull the trigger.

643
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,664
If I learned one thing
as a sheriff, it was that.

644
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:03,658
You never learned
to shoot no man in the back.

645
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,374
Harley's killing
of those two payroll guards

646
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:12,343
got this whole valley
stirred up.

647
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:14,946
Well, maybe Harley was
a little hasty.

648
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:15,947
Won't happen again.

649
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,849
I'll take care of that.

650
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,552
Meantime, we've got
a posse on our necks.

651
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,687
Why worry about that?

652
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,756
I've led other posses
around in circles

653
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,990
till they got dizzy and quit.

654
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,192
I can do it again.

655
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,093
This ain't other posses.

656
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,528
This is Ben Cartwright
and his boys.

657
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,896
They ain't going to quit.

658
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:35,466
We're simple, honest cowmen
from sunup till dusk,

659
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:39,137
just chasing strays
out of the draws.

660
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,129
Denver, they're not strays.

661
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:47,245
Any good cowman rides by,
he's going to see

662
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,081
you're just drifting a few head
up and down the valley.

663
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,717
Now, we've been
in this a long time.

664
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,186
How come you're getting
sweat up about it now?

665
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,223
'Cause I'm thinking of Connie,

666
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,158
like we both was
when we started.

667
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:05,129
Miles, I know you love that kid
like she was your own daughter.

668
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,566
I know you're worried about
her finding out; she won't.

669
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,804
Couple of more jobs
like the last one,

670
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,239
we'll have everything
we ever wanted for her.

671
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,943
I don't figure it that way.

672
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,813
Now, wait a minute.

673
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,948
You getting ideas
about quitting me?

674
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,611
We both ought to quit, Denver.

675
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,687
But I don't think we can.

676
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,023
What are you getting at?

677
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,591
First it was just you and me.

678
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,860
Then you sent me out
to the Colorado badlands--

679
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,229
pick up a lot of hard cases,

680
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:42,634
give 'em big talk
about big pickings.

681
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,637
Well, they've had a taste of it.

682
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,639
You can't expect them
to let go now.

683
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:51,042
I can call this thing off
anytime I want to.

684
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,476
Can you?

685
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:57,245
Harley, Brennan, all of you.

686
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,123
We heard talk about some
of you boys wanting to pull out.

687
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,758
Where'd you hear that?

688
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:11,296
The payroll we've piled up--
we're better than $30,000 now.

689
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,164
That's nothing
to what we're going to do.

690
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,224
We got more men coming in,
good men.

691
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,570
Denver here was wondering
how you men felt

692
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,740
about a man quitting
with his share if he wants to.

693
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,610
Why, nobody better even think
of pulling out.

694
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,612
We come here to clean up.

695
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:32,083
That sets real good with me and
that's what I'm aiming to do.

696
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,281
Isn't that the way
you feel about it, boss?

697
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,157
Sure.

698
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:41,793
Yeah, Miles and I just wanted
to see how you felt.

699
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,127
Don't worry, boss.

700
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,461
The first man tries
to run out on us, I'll kill.

701
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,018
(Ben sighs wearily)

702
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,419
Ben! Come on in.

703
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:13,791
You fellows look
as if you could use a drink.

704
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,294
A little water
would be right fine.

705
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,563
Trouble?

706
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:23,034
Well, they, they jumped
Winkler and Corey.

707
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,937
Wouldn't you know
they'd put up a fight.

708
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:29,040
Winkler got killed
and Corey got hit.

709
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,475
Bad?

710
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,710
Well, not too bad.

711
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,945
Thanks.

712
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,013
Got in the shoulder.

713
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,748
He'll be all right.

714
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:38,750
Did he recognize any of them?

715
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,752
Nope.

716
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,553
But we ran across

717
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,390
the trail of one of them
before--a redhead.

718
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,426
That redhead had to be the one
that killed ol' Pete Redfern.

719
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,361
BEN: Ran across the trail
of another one of them.

720
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,997
Corey tells me that he's seen
him before.

721
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,433
Recognized him by his walk,
set of his shoulders.

722
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,435
Corey says he must have
seen him

723
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,703
a dozen times somewhere.

724
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,439
Without his mask,
he'd be somebody we know.

725
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,740
Might even be a neighbor.

726
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,275
A neighbor?!

727
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,511
I find that hard
to believe, Ben.

728
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,714
Well, I didn't want
to believe it either,

729
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,350
but we picked up
their trail today.

730
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:16,387
They doubled back on their
tracks right down the main road.

731
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,089
They didn't have
to worry about being seen

732
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,357
because they're seen there
every day.

733
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,460
More killings every day.

734
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,195
That's why we're here, Denver.

735
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:28,199
I spent the better part of my
life as a peace officer, Ben.

736
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,167
I was lucky.

737
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:30,568
I only caught one bullet.

738
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,471
You got a sheriff,
you got all the men you need.

739
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,573
Don't ask me to press my luck.

740
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,876
You pressed it when you went out
with us the other day.

741
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,478
We're all taking
the same chance.

742
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,380
Not according to the odds.

743
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,916
I've been riding a streak
of luck for 30 years.

744
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,385
I don't intend to press it
any further.

745
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,421
So far, they've only hit the
miners and the mine payrolls.

746
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,890
They might decide to branch out.

747
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:56,928
You could be helping to put out
a fire in your own house.

748
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,763
My own house?

749
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,500
All right, about time I started
taking care of my own house.

750
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,735
Been taking care of other
people's houses for 20 years!

751
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,237
What the devil it ever get me?!

752
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,273
A hundred dollars a month,
a lot of plaques on the wall,

753
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,402
a pat on the back
and a bullet in the shoulder.

754
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,675
(Ben sighs)

755
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,789
Denver...

756
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,858
I had no idea you felt this way.

757
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,426
Well, now you know!

758
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:31,796
I'm sick and tired of taking
care of other people's troubles!

759
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,198
Don't you think I owe something
to my own kid?

760
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,239
Yeah, well,
I guess you got a right

761
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,174
to your own way of thinking.

762
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,576
Not gonna press you.

763
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:48,880
But we're going out
after those killers.

764
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,644
Come on, boys.

765
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,032
Hey, where'll I put these?

766
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,044
It's a good thing
she ran out of money.

767
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,546
You'd have had
to send in a hay wagon.

768
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,080
Oh, Little Joe,
you know perfectly well

769
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,582
I needed every one
of these things.

770
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,717
I'm sure you did, Connie.

771
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,986
- Stay to supper?
- Uh, no, thanks.

772
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,688
I better show my face
around the Ponderosa.

773
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,590
They're going to forget
I'm a member of the family,

774
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:33,858
start charging me
room and board.

775
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,992
He'll change his mind.

776
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,460
I'm going to put
these things upstairs,

777
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,296
then I'll be down
to cook supper, Dad.

778
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,164
You'd better stay, Little Joe.

779
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,900
She's a pretty good cook.

780
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,869
(sighs)

781
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,439
You got a wonderful girl there,
Mr. McKee.

782
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,709
That's what I always
wanted her to be.

783
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,511
I, uh...

784
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,113
I wanted to talk to you
about Connie and me.

785
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,014
Well...

786
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,321
What's on your mind?

787
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,490
Well, sir, Connie and I
have known each other

788
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,292
for a long time.

789
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,294
Haven't we, sir?

790
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,430
Yes, you have;
quite a long time.

791
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,167
And I know you've probably heard
a lot of stories about--

792
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,002
well, about me and those
Virginia City girls,

793
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,437
but I just wanted you to know

794
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,906
that they didn't mean a thing
to me; not any of them.

795
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,475
I hope you didn't tell them
that at the time.

796
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,645
Well, uh, no, sir,
not at the time.

797
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:30,514
I... Well, I'm...

798
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:33,184
Anyway, that's not the way
it is with Connie and me.

799
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,719
I'm very fond of her, sir.

800
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,487
Fond, hmm?

801
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:40,057
And if Connie will have
me, I...

802
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,193
Well, what I'm trying
to say is, sir,

803
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,128
I'd like to ask her to marry me.

804
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,534
Well, I don't think
there's any way

805
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,770
I can keep you from asking her.

806
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,973
Does that mean
you'd rather I wouldn't?

807
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,805
I don't mean that at all.

808
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,880
All I ever wanted
was for Connie to be happy,

809
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,784
have the chances
other girls have.

810
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,154
Sir, that's what I mean
to offer her.

811
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:13,524
Suppose I knew all along
this'd happen.

812
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,726
I should've known.

813
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,321
I should have known.

814
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:23,534
I'm sorry I upset you, sir.

815
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,042
Well, I'll be
getting on home now.

816
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:33,068
Tell Connie I'll see her soon.

817
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,559
Little Joe gone?

818
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,996
Yeah, he just talked to me.

819
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,765
I was hoping he would.

820
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,968
Like that, is it?

821
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,071
Yes, it's like that.

822
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,107
He mentioned marriage.

823
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,377
One thing at a time, Dad.

824
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,112
First you fall in love.

825
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,780
I thought you'd done
that already.

826
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,282
Uh-huh.

827
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,085
But you have to give it
time to grow.

828
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,487
To build dreams,

829
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,156
to be so filled with happiness
in the wonder of it

830
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:20,958
that you're about
ready to explode.

831
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,326
And then you get married.

832
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,362
Dear, all that we talked about--

833
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,930
selling all this,
heading east.

834
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,632
You were so dead set on that
when we first got here.

835
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,868
I know,
but I didn't realize then.

836
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,970
You thought you couldn't
be happy out here.

837
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,372
I didn't think so either.

838
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,674
That's what I didn't realize--

839
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,610
that geography has
nothing to do with happiness.

840
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,313
Oh, Dad.

841
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,749
I know why you were
talking about

842
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,951
selling out and going east.

843
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,487
And I'll always love you
a whole lot more

844
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,122
because you were
doing it for me.

845
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:55,359
But now you know.

846
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,262
I know.

847
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,824
Baby, all I ever wanted
for you was happiness.

848
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,444
Well, all right,
go ahead and say it.

849
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:15,179
What do you want us to say?

850
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,680
Aw, come on, Adam.

851
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,816
You been walking around it
like it was a rattlesnake.

852
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,478
All right, it's somebody
we know--a neighbor.

853
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,822
Well, come on,
say the rest of it!

854
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,724
You think Denver McKee
had something to do with it.

855
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,159
Now, nobody said that, Joe.

856
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,527
Nobody's even thinking it.

857
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,961
Oh, no? Then why did you tell me

858
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,630
about what Denver said about
not wanting to help,

859
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,566
then you drop it so fast I could
hear the thud when it hit?

860
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,536
The only thud
you hear is your heart

861
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,164
when somebody mentions
the name of McKee.

862
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:48,412
Pa, what do you really think?

863
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:52,550
I'd stake my life that Denver
had nothing to do with it.

864
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,685
ADAM: Well, I hope
you're right, Pa.

865
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,021
But we have to face the truth.

866
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,290
There was only one man that
wasn't at Connie's party

867
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,125
the night the Silverado payroll
was stolen.

868
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,927
That's right--Miles Briscoe.

869
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,061
Yeah.

870
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:05,596
You know,
when I was telling Denver

871
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,131
about the party,
Miles was with him.

872
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,799
He said he couldn't go
to the party

873
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,135
'cause he had to look after
things at the Flying M.

874
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,770
All right, so he wasn't
at the party.

875
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,705
Does that prove anything?

876
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,741
No, of course
it doesn't, Joe, I...

877
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,711
But it's worth looking into.

878
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:24,048
Hoss, why don't you ride out
to the McKee place,

879
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,749
have a look around,

880
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:28,319
and if Miles leaves the ranch,
trail him.

881
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,287
How long do you want me
to stay, Pa?

882
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,518
Well, one of us will
relieve you in the morning.

883
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,032
Ah, come on,
don't look so worried.

884
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,418
Dad-burn you, Joe.

885
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,558
Like to scared me to death.

886
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:08,692
You must be half Injun.

887
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,661
You was plumb up on me
before I knew it.

888
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,996
You ain't seen anything?

889
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,097
Not a thing.

890
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:14,498
I think we're wasting our time.

891
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,699
Yeah, well, we're young,
brother.

892
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,967
We got plenty of time.

893
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,069
Maybe so, but as slow
as it went last night,

894
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,971
I feel like I'm 90 years old
already.

895
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,506
I'm gonna go get me some sleep.

896
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:23,641
All right.
Breakfast is all ready.

897
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,009
- It is?
- Mm-hmm.

898
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,111
Then sleep's going to be
the second thing I get.

899
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,273
Hey, Hoss.

900
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,018
Take a look at that.

901
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:45,863
A redheaded man, a stranger,
Miles and Denver.

902
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,399
Come on, let's go get
Pa and Adam.

903
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,234
Right.

904
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,903
I'm telling you
for the last time.

905
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,606
Don't you come around
this ranch anymore.

906
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:58,008
That red hair is like
a lantern.

907
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,343
You've been seen--twice.

908
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:00,744
Don't make any difference.

909
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,980
The two that seen me ain't
doing any talking.

910
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,782
Well, you're wrong.

911
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:08,852
Pete Redfern identified you
before he died.

912
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:12,122
And Corey,
the miner you shot yesterday,

913
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,390
he's still alive.

914
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,892
Well, I must be out of practice.

915
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,728
You're not out of practice.
You're just out of brains.

916
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,830
I think we ought to lay low
for a while,

917
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,332
till things quiet down.

918
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:24,335
You fellas sound like you're
getting a streak up your back.

919
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,236
You set up this play, Denver.

920
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,439
The rest of us have been
taking all the risks.

921
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,608
Sure, we had to do
a little shooting.

922
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,242
I want you to clear out of here!

923
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,111
You think I want my daughter
to see you?!

924
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,146
No, I don't think much
about your daughter

925
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,681
one way or the other, Mr. McKee.

926
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,917
And I'm tired of sleeping
up in those rocks.

927
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,152
You got a bunkhouse back there.

928
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,620
I mean to use it.

929
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,528
(horse whinnies)

930
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:35,673
DENVER:
Good morning, Ben.

931
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,665
Morning, Denver.

932
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,679
You know this man?

933
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,681
Sure he knows me, Ben.
What about it?

934
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,316
We've been looking for
a redheaded man.

935
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,585
HOSS: You're the only redheaded
man in the area--

936
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,754
other than a barber
in Virginia City.

937
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,123
Since when has being
redheaded a crime?

938
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:55,659
Since we found out that
a redhead killed two men,

939
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,855
and maybe two others.

940
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,799
Do you figure to do
anything about it?

941
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:20,984
Dad!

942
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,077
Connie!

943
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,897
You take Connie back
into the house.

944
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,032
Right.

945
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,667
Come on, Connie.

946
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,659
Come on.

947
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,408
BEN:
Now put away your guns, boys.

948
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,274
You won't need 'em.

949
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,815
You're taking a lot of chances,
aren't you, Ben?

950
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:54,218
I could outshoot you
any day you lived.

951
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:56,220
Maybe so.

952
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,457
There's no reason
for it to come to that.

953
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:02,926
Denver, why?

954
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,829
I'd have staked my life you had
nothing to do with this.

955
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:06,930
Why?

956
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,333
That's very simple, Ben.

957
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,201
I ran out of money.

958
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:13,203
I did what I had to do.

959
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,838
And I'm not backing down
from it.

960
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:17,407
There are other ways.

961
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,510
What other ways?

962
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,513
I did a good job as a marshal.

963
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:26,083
When I needed money,
I turned to what I knew best.

964
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,245
I did a pretty good job
at that, too.

965
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:34,018
Denver... I'm going to have
to take you in.

966
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,695
Now give me your gun.

967
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,493
No, no, Ben.

968
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,601
You got to take it.

969
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:45,869
HOSS:
Pa, he means it.

970
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,360
Yeah, Ben, I mean it.

971
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,938
No, Denver, no.

972
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:05,155
Denver...

973
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,659
Now don't you go
blaming yourself, Ben.

974
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,429
A man pulls a gun on you,
you got to draw your own.

975
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,365
You got to pull the trigger.

976
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:37,154
He could outdraw me
any day of his life.

977
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:40,613
And he could shoot
a lot straighter than that.

978
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,544
You sure you want to go?

979
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,846
I have to go, Joe.

980
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,582
I have to get away.

981
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:09,417
I need time to think...
and time to forget.

982
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,253
I understand.

983
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,030
I love you.

984
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,684
