Did you see,
what I saw?

28
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,140
C'mon Joe, open it up.
We're going to have a big day, today

29
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:13,773
- You're in a hurry?
- Yeah, I sure am.

30
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:16,860
You're a fool.
Come on.

31
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:23,908
All right, all right, ladies and gentlemen.
Let us begin.

Would the bride and groom
kindly step forward?

00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:33,627
Will Kane and Amy Fowler,

34
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:38,549
you appear before me in my capacity
as Justice of the Peace of this township.

35
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:42,428
To be joined together
in the bounds of holy matrimony.

36
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:52,813
- Man, it sure is hot.
- Hot? You call this hot?

- Well, I'll be...
- What's the matter?

38
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,860
I thought I saw Ben Miller.

00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:04,117
- Ah, he's down Texas somewhere.
- I know.

40
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:08,330
Looked like Pierce and Colby, too.
No, it couldn't be Miller.

My goodness gracious

- Yes, sir. That is, I think so, sir.

Don't know reason why
it shouldn't be...Mr Pierce.

How're you,
Mr Miller... Mr Pierce... Mr Colby?

45

Do you, Will Kane, take Amy
to be your lawful wedded wife,

46
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:34,670
to have and to hold from this day forward,
until death do you part?

47
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,214
I do.

48

Do you Amy take Will
to be your lawful wedded husband

Amy, people ought to be alone
when they get married.

00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,818
I know.

58
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:40,863
I'm gonna try, Amy.
I'll do my best.

59

I will too.

- No privacy on his wedding day.

and Will's a free man, more or less.

turn in your badge.

64
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:08,851
To tell you the truth, I hate to do this
without your new Marshal being here.

your very good friends.

With the fine job you've done I feel free here
to say, and the judge will bare me out,

00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:23,030
this town will be safe
'til tomorrow.

69

You win. But don't marry a Quaker,
she'll have you running a store.

70
00:08:28,873 --> 00:08:31,917
- I can't picture you doing that, Will
- I can.

71
00:08:32,126 --> 00:08:35,003
So can I,
and a good thing, too.

72
00:08:35,213 --> 00:08:37,089
Thank you.

73
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:40,301
You didn't talk that way
when you were wearing a star.

74
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,180
All right, it's coming off.
But I gotta to be paid first.

75
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:50,729
- Let me down!
- Not until you kiss me.

76
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:54,274
Will, let me down,
you fool!

a telegram for you.

80
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:17,799
It's terrible,
it's shocking.

81
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:23,513
- They've pardoned Frank Miller.
- I don't believe it.

82
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:25,890
We could go too.

83
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:28,602
- Nice of them to let you know.
- And that ain't all.

84
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:31,854
Ben Miller is down the depot now
with Jim Pierce and Jack Colby.

85
00:09:32,064 --> 00:09:35,317
- He asked about the noon train.
- The noon train?

86
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,951
Will.. You get out of this town.
Get out of this town this very minute.

87
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,122
- What is it?
- Never mind that now.

88
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:50,720
But, what is it,
Mr Howe?

89
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,420
Don't you worry. Just get out of town,
and everything will be alright.

90
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,250
- We'll take care of everything.
- I think I ought to stay.

91
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,710
Are you crazy?
Think of Amy.

92
00:10:03,345 --> 00:10:07,350
Goodbye, Amy.
Don't worry, everything will be alright

93
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,350
Good luck, boy!
Hurry!

94
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:29,123
Hm...
That's funny.

95
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:35,130
- What?
- Oh, you can't see now.

96
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,759
Kane and his new wife
just took off in a big hurry.

97
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:43,304
- What's so funny?
- I mean, a big hurry.

98
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:48,726
Hey, you don't suppose
Kane's scared of those three gunnies?

99
00:10:50,937 --> 00:10:54,357
I never saw him
whip a horse that way.

100
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:09,039
- Sam?
- Come in, Helen.

101
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:14,378
Ben Miller is in town.
He has two of the old bunch with him.

102
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:21,093
I guess
I'll take a look around.

103
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,351
- Why are you stopping?
- It's no good. I've got go back, Amy.

104
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,729
- Why?
- This is crazy. I haven't got any guns.

105
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,358
- Then let's go on. Hurry.
- No.

106
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,485
That's what I've been thinking.

107
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,406
They're making me run.
I've never run from anybody before.

108
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:24,952
- I don't understand any of this.
- I don't have time to tell you.

109
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,081
- Then don't go back, Will
- I've got to. That's the whole thing.

110
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:32,939
Kane's back!

111
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,568
- Don't believe it.
- Just seen him!

112
00:13:38,821 --> 00:13:40,906
- How many coffins have we got?
- Two.

113
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:43,242
We'll need at least two more,
no matter how you figure it.

114
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:45,494
You better get busy,
Fred.

115
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:53,169
Please Will,
if you'd just tell me what this is all about.

116
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:57,256
I sent a man up five years ago for murder.
He was supposed to hang.

117
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:01,886
But up north, they commuted it to life
and now he's free.

118
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,514
I don't know how.
It looks like he's coming back.

119
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:06,891
- I still don't understand.
- He's a...

120
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:12,064
He was always wild and kind of crazy.
He'll probably make trouble.

121
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:15,484
But that's no concern of yours.
Not any more.

122
00:14:15,692 --> 00:14:17,778
I'm the one who sent him up.

123
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:22,659
But that was part of your job. It's finished, now.
They've got a new Marshal

124
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:27,831
He won't be here until tomorrow.
Seems to me I've got to stay.

125
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:32,252
- Anyway, m the same man with or without this.
- That isn't so.

126
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:36,047
I expect he'll come looking for me.
Three of his old bunch are waiting for him.

127
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:39,885
- That's why we ought to go.
- They'll just come after us.

128
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:44,180
Four of them...
And we'd be all alone in the prairie.

129
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:46,683
- We've got an hour.
- What's an hour?

130
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,228
It's a hundred miles. We'd never be able
to keep that store, Amy.

131
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:53,023
They'd come after us. We'd have to run
again as long as we live.

132
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:56,985
No, you wouldn't.
Not, if they didn't know where to find us.

133
00:14:58,571 --> 00:15:02,617
- I'm begging you, please, let's go.
- I can't.

134
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:06,579
Don't try to be a hero.
You don't have to be a hero, not for me.

135
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:10,499
I'm not not trying to be a hero.
If you think I like this, you're crazy.

136
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:14,087
Look, Amy. This is my town.
I've got friends here.

137
00:15:14,253 --> 00:15:17,150
I'll swear in bunch of special deputies,
and with a posse behind me,

138
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,750
maybe there won't be any trouble.

139
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:23,305
- You know there'll be trouble.
- Then, it's better to have it here.

140
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,771
I'm sorry, honey.
I know how you feel about it.

141
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:35,401
- Do you?
- Of course I do. It's against your religion.

142
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:40,406
- Sure I know how you feel
- But you're doing it just the same.

143
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:45,203
Oh, Will..
We were married just a few minutes ago.

144
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:49,708
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.
Doesn't that mean anything?

145
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:53,420
You know I've only got an hour,
and I've got lots to do.

146
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,964
Stay at the hotel
until it's over.

147
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,467
No,
I won't be here when it's over.

148
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:02,345
You're asking me to wait an hour to find out
if I'll be a wife or a widow.

149
00:16:02,512 --> 00:16:05,765
- It's too long to wait. I won't do it.
- Amy...

150
00:16:05,974 --> 00:16:10,354
I mean it. If you won't go with me now,
I'll be on that train when it leaves here.

151
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,774
I've got to stay.

152
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,270
" <i>On this,
our wedding daaayyy.</i>"

153
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:30,770
" <i>Do not forsake me,
oh, my daaarlin',</i> "

154
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:36,770
" <i>Although you're grievin',
I can't be leavin'</i>  "

155
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:40,302
- Glad you got here, Percy.
- Are you?

156
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:56,694
Have you forgotten that I'm the man that
passed sentence on Frank Miller?

157
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,488
You shouldn't have come back,
Will

158
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:03,368
I figured I had to.
I figured I had to stay.

159
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:07,580
- You figured wrong.
- I can deputize a posse, 10-12 guns.

160
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:11,793
- My intuition tells me otherwise.
- Why?

161
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:16,964
No time for a lesson in civics,
my boy.

162
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:19,426
In the 5th century BC
the citizens of Athens,

163
00:17:19,592 --> 00:17:23,221
having suffered under a tyrant,
managed to banish him.

164
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:26,809
When he returned years later
with an army of mercenary,

165
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:30,771
those same citizens
not only opened their gates for him,

166
00:17:30,938 --> 00:17:35,401
but stood by while he executed
members of the League of Government.

167
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:41,574
Similar thing happened eight years ago
in a town called Indian Falls.

168
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:47,747
I escaped death only through the intercession
of a lady of somewhat dubious reputation,

169
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:52,127
and the cost of a very handsome ring
which once belonged to my mother.

170
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:54,379
Unfortunately,
I have no more rings.

171
00:17:54,587 --> 00:17:59,175
- You're a judge.
- Been a judge many times and many towns.

172
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:04,765
- I hope to live to be a judge again.
- I can't tell you what to do.

173
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,920
Why must you be so stupid?
Have you forgotten what he is?

174
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,020
Have you forgotten what he's done to people?
Forgotten that he's crazy?

175
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,440
Don't you remember when he sat
in that chair and said:

176
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:19,113
<i>''You'll never hang me. I'll come back
I swear it. I'll kill you, Kane!''</i>

177
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:28,665
Here you are, ma'am.
This will take you to St. Louis.

178
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:30,450
Thank you.

179
00:18:37,466 --> 00:18:41,094
Maybe you'd rather wait somewhere else.
Like at the hotel, maybe.

180
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:44,514
- All right thank you.
- I'm sorry about all this, Mrs Kane.

181
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:48,018
Don't you worry.
The Marshal'll take care of himself alright.

182
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:50,687
Thank you
very much.

183
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,815
Hey, that wasn't here
five years ago.

184
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:58,487
- So what?
- Nothing...yet.

185
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:08,080
Harvey, don't you think
Kane will be looking for you about now?

186
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,760
- You're really sore at him.
- Wouldn't you be if you were me?

187
00:19:12,877 --> 00:19:16,089
I suppose...
if I were you.

188
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:26,350
Be back in a little while.

189
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:49,541
- Goodbye, Will
- Goodbye.

190
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,002
- You think I'm letting you down, don't you?
- No.

191
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:57,382
Look, this is just a dirty little village
in the middle of nowhere.

192
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:00,803
Nothing that happens here
is really important. Now get out.

193
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:02,760
There isn't time.

194
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,016
What a waste.
Good luck.

195
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:20,781
Johnny!

196
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:26,537
- Why ain't you in church?
- Why ain't you?

197
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:28,080
Will you do somethin'
for me?

198
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:31,960
Go find Anderson, Howe and Fuller,
and tell them I want them here.

199
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:35,797
- Then find Harv Pell!
- Don't have to do that. I'm right here.

200
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:39,008
- Where have you been?
- Busy.

201
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,720
You know what's doing?
We've got lots to do.

202
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:45,723
Hold up a second.
This ain't really your job, you know.

203
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:49,853
- That's what everybody keeps telling me.
- Just listen a second.

204
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:54,275
- All right, I'm listening.
- This is the way I see it.

205
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:59,739
If you'd gone with the new Marshal
not due till tomorrow, I'd be in charge, right?

206
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:04,285
If I'm good enough to hold down the job
when there's trouble,

207
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:06,788
how come the city fathers
didn't trust me with it permanently?

208
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,458
- I don't know.
- Don't you?

209
00:21:09,665 --> 00:21:13,753
- No.
- I figure you carry a lot of weight.

210
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:17,632
Maybe they didn't ask me.
Maybe they figured you were too young.

211
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:21,553
- You think I'm too young too?
- You sure act like it sometimes. Come on.

212
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:36,485
It's very simple, Will. You just tell
the old boys that I'm the new Marshal.

213
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:40,322
Tomorrow they can tell the other fellow
sorry but that the job's filled.

214
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,035
- You really mean it, don't you?
- Sure.

215
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:48,789
- But I can't do it.
- Why not?

216
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:52,544
- If you don't know, it's no use me tellin' you.
- You mean you won't do it?

217
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:55,256
- Have it your way.
- All right

218
00:21:55,421 --> 00:21:59,760
The truth is, you probably
talked against me from the start.

219
00:21:59,926 --> 00:22:04,140
You've been sore about me
and Helen Ramirez right along, ain't you?

220
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,476
You and Helen Ramirez?
I...

221
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:12,397
It so happens I didn't know and it don't mean
anything to me, you ought to know that.

222
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:14,692
Yeah, you've been washed up
for more than a year.

223
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,572
You get married, only, you can't stand
anybody taking your place there...

224
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,617
- ...especially me.
- You're...

225
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:33,545
- I haven't got time, Harv.
- Okay, let's get down to business.

226
00:22:33,837 --> 00:22:36,090
You want me to stick,
you put a word in for me.

227
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:40,635
Sure I want you to stick, but I'm not buying it.
It's gotta be up to you.

228
00:23:15,838 --> 00:23:18,550
I thought you'd grew up
by now.

229
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,888
I thought your disposition might've
sweetened up a little down in Abilene.

230
00:23:23,054 --> 00:23:25,641
I guess we're both wrong.

231
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:34,776
What's so funny?

232
00:23:35,026 --> 00:23:37,361
Did you really think
you could put that over on Kane?

233
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,782
- Why not?
- When are you going to grow up?

234
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:43,409
- I'm getting tired of that kind of talk.
- Then grow up.

235
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,030
Cut it out!

236
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:53,044
- All right
- Why should he have gone for it?

237
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:56,090
He needs me plenty
when Frank Miller gets here.

238
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,717
- That's possible.
- He should've had me made Marshal.

239
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:02,722
- He's just sore. Sore about you and me.
- Is he?

240
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,180
Sure.

241
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:07,434
- You told him?
- Sure.

242
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:09,978
You're a fool.

243
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:13,899
Why?
Didn't you want him to know?

244
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:20,572
Hey... Who did the walking out anyway,
you or him?

245
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,829
Get out,
Harvey.

246
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,666
- I might just do that.
- Then do it!

247
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:34,420
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.

248
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:38,258
You're gonna talk different
when Frank Miller gets here.

249
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:41,345
You might want somebody around,
when you try to explain about Kane.

250
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:44,265
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.

251
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:49,100
I've heard that you might not be so pretty
when he gets through with you.

252
00:24:52,315 --> 00:24:55,693
- I won't be back.
- Good.

- No.
- All right.

May I wait here
for the noon train?

- Yes.

You're leaving on the noon train,
but your husband ain't.

- No, why?
- No reason, but it's mighty interesting.

- Come in, Mr Weaver.
- Hello Mrs. Ramirez.

291
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,580
- Hello. Sit down, please.
- Thanks

292
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,710
- Is there anything wrong, Mrs Ramirez?
- No.

293
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,710
Then,
why did you send for me?

294
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,300
I'm leaving town.
I want to sell the store.

295
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,930
- You want to buy me out?
- Well, how much did you want?

296
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,850
Two thousand.
I think that's fair.

297
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,480
It's fair alright, 
but I couldn't raise that much right now.

298
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,520
- How much can you raise?
- Oh... 1000 dollars.

299
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,150
All right you can pay Sam the rest
in six months.

300
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,370
- He'll get it to me. A deal?
- Yes, ma'am.

301
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,750
All right, Mr Weaver.
Thank you.

302
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,250
Mrs Ramirez, I want to
thank you for everything, I mean...

303
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,670
When you first put the deal to me
about staking me in the store,

304
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,640
and being a silent partner,
you know, my wife thought...

305
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,520
Err... What I really mean to say is that
you've been real decent to me right along,

306
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,690
and I want you to know
that I've been honest with you.

307
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,520
I know you have, Mr Weaver.
Goodbye.

308
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,900
Goodbye, Mrs Ramirez.
And good luck to you.

309
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,900
Thank you.

310
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,510
- Will..
- Amy. You've changed your mind.

311
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,140
I thought you'd
changed yours.

312
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,560
No, Will,
I have my ticket.

313
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,020
I see.

314
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,570
Clean number 19.
Mrs Miller is very particular.

315
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,410
- Is Helen Ramirez in?
- I guess so.

316
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,240
Think you can find it
alright?

Come in.

319
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,690
What are you looking at?
You think I have changed?

320
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:59,190
Well, what do you want?
You want me to help you?

321
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,610
You want me to ask Frank to let you go?
You want me to beg for you?

322
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,120
I would not do it.
I would not lift a finger for you.

323
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,210
I came to tell you he was coming.
I should've figured you know about it.

324
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,960
I know about it.

325
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,710
You ought to get out of town
or I might not be able to...well..

326
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,880
- Anything can happen.
- I'm not afraid of him.

327
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,890
I know you're not but you...
you know how he is.

328
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,220
I know
how he is.

329
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,980
Maybe he doesn't know.

330
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:38,030
- He's probably got letters.
- What about it?

331
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,660
Nothing in life is free.
I'm getting out. I'm packing.

332
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,500
That's good.

- Goodbye, Helen.
- Kane...

If you're smart,
you will get out, too.

337
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,190
- I can't.
- I know.

338
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,470
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

339
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,940
- Who is Miss Ramirez?
- Mrs Ramirez?

340
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,020
She used to be a friend of your husband's
a while back.

341
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,610
Before that
she was a friend of Frank Miller's.

342
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,990
I see.
Thank you.

343
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,160
- You don't like my husband, do you?
- No.

344
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,000
- Why?
- Lots of reasons.

345
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,790
One thing, this place was always busy
when Frank Miller was around.

346
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,380
I'm not the only one.

347
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,170
There's plenty of people think
he's got a comeuppance coming.

348
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,590
You asked me, ma'am,
so I'm telling you.

349
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,040
- I'll go and get some liquor.
- You have to have it?

350
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,250
- Yeah.
- If you're going after that...

351
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,250
- I said I was going for liquor.
- Keep away from Kane.

352
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,170
Sure,
I can wait.

Hello, Harv.
Where's the tin star?

355
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,670
- I turned it in and quit.
- Smart move.

356
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,340
I didn't ask you
for your opinion.

357

Hey, Ben!
How are you?

358

Hey,
look who's here!

359
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,830
- How are you, Ben?
- Give me a bottle.

360
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,800
- It's been a long time, Ben.
- Yeah.

361
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,890
- Yes, sir.
- How's Frank?

362
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,640
- He's not complaining.
- It'll be a hot time in the old town tonight, eh?

363
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,070
I wouldn't be surprised.

364
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,000
I'll give you odds Kane's dead five minutes
after Frank gets off the train.

365
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:36,750
- It's not much time.
- That's all Frank'll need, because I...

366
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,730
You carry a badge and a gun, Marshal.
You ain't got no call to do that.

367
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,320
You're right.

No.

why I am here.

You must be crazy comin' in here
to raise a posse.

372
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,730
Frank's got friends in this room.
You ought to know that.

373
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,770
Some of you were special deputies when we
broke this bunch. I need you again...now.

374
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,900
Things were different then, Kane.

375
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,490
You had six steady deputies 
to start off with.

376
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Every one a top gun.
You ain't got but two now.

377
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:51,790
You ain't got two.
Harv Pell says he just quit. Why?

That's between the two of us.

379

You're asking an awful lot Kane,
considering the kind of man Frank Miller is.

00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,510
All right
We all know what Miller's like.

438
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,000
So I'm going someplace else,
that's all.

439
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:16,170
And as for you, I don't like anybody to put
his hands on me unless I want him to.

440
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,220
And I don't like you to
...anymore.

441
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,720
" <i>He made a vow
while in state prison</i> "

442
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,720
" <i>Vowed it would be my life
or his'n</i>  "

443
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,720
" <i>I'm not afraid of death
but oh</i> "

444
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:35,720
" <i>What will I do
if you leeeave me?</i> "

445
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,650
Our text today
is from Malachi, chapter four.

446
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:46,700
<i>''For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn
as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all..''</i>

447
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:53,540
Yes?

448
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,050
I'm sorry, parson,
I don't want to disturb the services...

449
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:01,840
You already have. You don't
come to this church very often, Marshal.

450
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:05,300
When you got married today
you didn't see fit to be married here.

451
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:09,180
What can be so important
to bring you here now?

452
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:11,730
I need help.

453
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,070
It's true, I haven't been a churchgoing man,
and maybe that's a bad thing.

454
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,280
I didn't get married here today
because my wife is a Quaker.

455
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,370
But I came here for help
because there are people here.

456
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I'm sorry, Marshal.
Say what you have to say.

457
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,550
Maybe some of you already know it,
but if you don't...

458
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,720
It looks like Frank Miller
is coming back on the noon train.

459
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,850
I need all the special deputies
I can get.

460
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,280
Well,
what are we waiting for?

461
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,950
Let's go.

462
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,160
Hold it a minute,
hold it!

463
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:07,160
Before we rush out into something
that isn't going to be so pleasant,

464
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:10,160
let's make sure we know
what this is all about.

465
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:16,000
What I want to know is this. Ain't it true
that Kane ain't no longer a Marshal?

466
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,970
And ain't it true there is personal trouble
between Kane and Miller?

467
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,390
All right, alright!
Quiet, everybody!

468
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,520
If there's a difference of opinion,
let everybody have a say.

469
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,980
But let's do it like grown-up people,
and let's get the kids out of the building.

470
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:13,060
- Anything on the train?
- It's on time as far as I know, sir.

471
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:20,130
I say it don't really matter 
if there's anything...

472
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,530
personal between Miller 
and the Marshal, here.

473
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,330
We all know who Miller is,
and what Miller is.

474
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:30,330
- What's more, we're wasting time.
- All right Coy!

475
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,670
Yes, we all know who Miller is
and we put him away once.

476
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,210
And who saved him from hanging?
The politicians up north.

477
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,010
I say, this is their mess.
Let them take care of it.

478
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,510
- Fryer?
- Well, I say this:

479
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,930
We've been paying good money all along
for a Marshal and deputies.

480
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,940
The first time there's any trouble,
we're supposed to take care of it ourselves.

481
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,110
What have we been paying for
all this time?

482
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:57,650
I say we're not peace officers,
and this ain't our job!

483
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:01,780
I've been saying right along,
we ought to have more deputies.

484
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,660
If we did,
we wouldn't be facing this thing, now.

485
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:09,500
Just a minute, just a minute!
Everybody, quiet!

486
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,420
Keep it orderly.
You had your hand up, Ezra?

487
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,840
I can't believe I've heard
some of the things said here.

488
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:17,800
You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.

489
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:21,300
Sure, we paid this man,
and he was the best Marshal we ever had.

490
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,640
It ain't his trouble,
it's ours.

491
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,850
If we don't do what's right,
we're gonna have plenty more trouble.

492
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,980
There ain't but one thing to do now,
and you all know what that is.

493
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:34,520
- Go ahead, Kibbee.
- This thing has been handled wrong.

494
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:37,650
Those three killers
walking the streets bold as brass...

495
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,360
Why didn't you put them in jail
where they ought to be?

496
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:44,120
Then we'd only have Miller to worry about
instead of the four.

497
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:48,330
I haven't anything to arrest them for.
They haven't done anything.

498
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:51,210
There's no law against them
sitting on a bench at the depot.

499
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,130
I can't listen to any more of this.
What's the matter with you people?

500
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,200
Don'tca remember when 
a decent woman

501
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,300
couldn't walk down the street 
in broad daylight?

502
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,720
Don'tca remember when this wasn't a fit place
to bring up a child?

503
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:07,600
How can you sit here, and talk, and talk,
and talk like this?

504
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:12,190
What are we getting so excited about?
How do we know Miller's on that train?

505
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,780
We can be pretty sure he's on it.
Time's getting short.

506
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:23,490
- Parson, you got anything to say?
- I don't know.

507
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,410
The commandment says
<i>''thou shalt not kill''</i>

508
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:29,290
but we hire men to go out
and do it for us.

509
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,710
The right and the wrong
seem pretty clear here,

510
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,550
but if you're asking me to tell my people
to go out and kill,

511
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:42,890
and maybe get themselves killed, I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

512
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,010
All right,
I'll say this.

513
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:51,230
What this town owes Will Kane, it can never
pay with money. Don't ever forget it.

514
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,270
He's the best Marshal we've ever had,
and maybe the best we'll ever have.

515
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,030
So if Miller comes back here today,
it's our problem, not his.

516
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,160
It's our problem
because this is our town.

517
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,660
We made it with our own hands,
out of nothing.

518
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:10,160
If we want to keep it decent
we gotta think mighty clear today.

519
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:14,840
We gotta have the courage to do what is right,
no matter how hard it is.

520
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,720
All right! There's gonna be fighting
when Kane and Miller meet.

521
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,100
And somebody's going to get hurt,
that's for sure.

522
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,930
Now...
People up north are thinking about this town.

523
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:34,310
Thinking about sending money down here,
to put up stores and factories.

524
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:37,820
It would mean a lot to this town,
an awful lot.

525
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:43,990
But if they'll read about shooting in the streets,
what are they going to think?

526
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,950
I'll tell you. They'll think
this is just another wide-open town,

527
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,790
and everything we worked for
will be wiped out.

528
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,920
In one day, this town
will be sat back five years.

529
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,760
And I don't think
we can let that happen.

530
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,640
Mind you, you all know
how I feel about this man.

531
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:08,980
He's a mighty brave man, a good man.
He didn't have to come back here today.

532
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:14,900
And for his sake, and a sake of this town,
I wish he hadn't.

533
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,360
Because if he's not here
when Miller comes,

534
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:20,740
my hunch is,
there won't be any trouble, not one bit.

535
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,870
Tomorrow we'll have a new Marshal
and if we offer him our services,

536
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,200
I think we can handle anything
that comes along.

537
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:34,000
To me that makes sense.
To me that's the only way out of this.

538
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,010
Will, I think you better go
while there's still time.

539
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,760
It's better for you and...
it's better for us.

540
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,440
Thanks.

541
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:26,610
[Playing tune on harmonica]

542
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,140
Why don't you put
that thing away?

543
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:47,830
- Bang, bang, bang!
- You're dead, Kane.

544

" <i>Waaait;

548
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:29,160
I just sent the kid to find you.
Didn't he come?

549
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,960
He was here.

550
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:37,210
You've been my friend all my life.
You got me this job.

551
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,050
You made them
send for me.

552
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,590
Ever since I was a kid
I wanted to be like you, Mart.

553
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:49,640
- You've been a law man all your life.
- Yeah, all my life. It's a great life.

554
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,810
You risk your skin catching killers,
and the juries turn them loose,

555
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,650
so they can come back,
and shoot at you again.

556
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:58,570
If you're honest,
you're poor your whole life.

557
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,950
And in the end you wind up dying all alone
on some dirty street.

558
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:08,160
For what?
For nothing. For a tin star.

559
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:13,290
Listen, the judge's left town, Harvey's quit,
and I'm having trouble getting deputies.

560
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,500
It figures.
It's all happening too sudden.

561
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,300
People got to talk themselves into law and 
order before they do anything about it.

562
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:26,430
Maybe because down deep they don't care.
They just don't care.

563
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,230
What'll I do,
Mart?

564
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,940
I was hopin' you
wouldn't come back.

565
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,660
- You know why I came back.
- But not to commit suicide.

566
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,410
Sometimes... 
Sometimes prison changes a man.

567
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:53,460
Not him. This is all planned,
that's why they're all here.

568
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:56,380
Get out, Will!
Get out.

569
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,430
Will you come down
to that depot with me?

570
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,890
No.

571
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:17,320
You know how I feel about you,
but I ain't goin' with you.

572
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:22,030
Seems like a man with busted knuckles
didn't need arthritis too, don't it?

573
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,910
No,
I couldn't do nothin' for you.

574
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,870
You'd be worried about me.
You'd get yourself killed worryin' about me.

575
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,250
It's too one-sided
like it is.

576
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:41,140
- So long, Martin.
- So long.

577
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,850
It's all for nothin', Will.
It's all for nothin'.

578
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:02,240
Excuse me,
what is Mrs Ramirez's room number?

579
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,120
- Three.
- Thank you.

580
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:25,390
Come in.

581
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,980
- Yes?
- Mrs Ramirez? I'm Mrs Kane.

582
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:34,270
I know.

583
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,820
- May I come in?
- If you like.

584
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,330
- Sit down, Mrs Kane.
- No, thank you.

585
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,460
- What do you want?
- Please...

586
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,790
It's just I'm afraid that if I sat down,
I wouldn't be able to get up again.

587
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,050
- Why?
- It wasn't easy for me to come here.

588
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,380
- Why?
- Look, Mrs Ramirez...

589
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:03,970
Will and I were married an hour ago.
We were all packed and ready to leave...

590
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,430
...then this thing happened
and he wouldn't go.

591
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:11,690
I did everything. I pleaded, I threatened,
I just couldn't reach him.

592
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,400
- And now?
- That man downstairs, the clerk..

593
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:19,320
He said things about you
and Will

594
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:22,070
I've tried to understand
why he wouldn't go with me,

595
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,240
and it's got to be because of you.

596
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:28,620
- What do you want from me?
- Let him go.

597
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,960
He still has a chance.
Let him go.

598
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,670
- I can not help you.
- Please.

599
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,170
He isn't staying
for me.

600
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:41,050
I haven't spoken to him for a year,
until today.

601
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:48,730
- I'm leaving on the same train you are.
- Then why is he staying?

602
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:53,400
If you don't know,
I can not explain it to you.

603
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:58,900
Thank you anyway.
You've been very kind.

604
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:05,450
What kind of woman are you?
How can you leave him like this?

605
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,200
Does the sound of guns
frighten you that much?

606
00:57:08,450 --> 00:57:11,630
No, Mrs Ramirez.
I've heard guns.

607
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:14,790
My father and my brother
were killed by guns.

608
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,260
They were on the right side, but that
didn't help them when the shooting started..

609
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,100
My brother was 19.
I watched him die.

610
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:29,270
That's when I became a Quaker.
I don't care who's right or who's wrong.

611
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,360
There's got to be some better way
for people to live.

612
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,690
Will knows how I feel about it.

613
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,120
Just a minute. Are you going to wait 
for the train downstairs?

614
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,740
- Yes.
- Why don't you wait here?

I've got no use for Kane,
but he's got guts.

619
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:08,730
You're mighty broadminded, 
Joe.

620
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,670
How about you? I always figured you had guts,


621
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,070
but I never gave you credit for brains, 
until now.

Go on, saddle him up.

before he tires.

wants is to get me out of town.

and getting out.

What's the matter with you?

641
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:53,730
You were ready to do it yourself.
You said so.

642
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,570
Look, Harv. I thought about it
because I was tired.

643
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,570
You think about a lot of things
when you're tired. But I can't do it.

- I don't know.

Get on that horse, 
Will!

646
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:11,170
Why is this so important?
You don't care if I live or die.

647
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,840
Come on.

648

I'm tired of being shoved.

If Kane was my man,
I'd never leave him. I'd get a gun.
