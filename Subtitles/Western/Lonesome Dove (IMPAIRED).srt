1
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:09,339
     Go down to the river       
     to eat that snake.         

2
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:11,374
         Go on, get.            
         Go on.                 
         Get out of here.       

3
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:37,160
         Little early           
         to be quitting,        
         ain't it, girls?       

4
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:38,695
     Or is it Christmas?        

5
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,434
                Girls yourself. 

6
00:06:47,638 --> 00:06:49,606
            It ain't            
            Christmas, neither. 

7
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,208
         It's that hell bitch.  

8
00:06:52,276 --> 00:06:54,511
         She bit a hunk         
         out of him.            

9
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:06,489
 I'm glad you got here          
 before fall, Newt.             

10
00:07:06,557 --> 00:07:08,524
 We've been                     
 missing you.                   

11
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:10,326
         It's supper time.      

12
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:13,129
 Either that                    
 or old Bolivar's               
 calling up bandits.            

13
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:16,933
 We hear you,                   
 dern it, we hear you!          

14
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,041
         'I God, Woodrow,       

15
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:27,744
         as long as you've      
         worked around horses,  

16
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:29,479
         I'd think              
         you wouldn't           

17
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:31,748
         turn your back         
         on Kiowa mares.        

18
00:07:31,816 --> 00:07:33,949
 You want to think              
 something,                     

19
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:36,519
 think that roof                
 back up on the barn            

20
00:07:36,587 --> 00:07:39,088
 instead of sitting             
 in the shade.                  

21
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:41,724
                 I ain't scared 
                 to be lazy.    

22
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,893
 That don't                     
 recommend you much.            

23
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,129
         Can we eat,            
         or are we waiting till 
         the argument's over?   

24
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:51,934
 You will starve                
 if you wait for that.          

25
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:09,686
             Many thanks.       

26
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:13,723
         If you ever get        
         tired of loafing,      

27
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,092
         you can get work       
         waiting tables.        

28
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,628
 I had a job                    
 waiting tables once,           

29
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:20,697
 on a riverboat.                

30
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:23,099
 Wasn't older                   
 than Newt there, but...        

31
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,135
 I had to give it up.           

32
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:26,435
                     How come?  

33
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:29,572
 Well, I was too                
 young and pretty.              

34
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,343
 The whores wouldn't            
 let me alone.                  

35
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:36,579
     Listening to you brag      
     don't improve the taste    

36
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:40,683
         of these Mexican       
         strawberries none.     

37
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:43,019
 The only way                   
 you'll get better food         

38
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,453
 is by shooting Bolivar.        

39
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:46,723
 And another thing, Bol.        

40
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,125
 Quit whacking that             
 dinner bell for supper.        

41
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:52,228
 Whack it at noon               
 if you want to.                

42
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:55,164
 A man with any sense           
 can tell it's sundown          

43
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:58,133
            without you         
            whacking that bell. 

44
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:01,504
         General Robert E. Lee  
         freed the slaves.      

45
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:05,041
             I can whack        
             if I want to.      

46
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:08,143
         Abe Lincoln            
         freed the slaves,      
         not General Lee.       

47
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:14,417
         He didn't              
         free Mexicans          
         anyway, Bol.           

48
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,886
         It was, uh...          

49
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:18,621
         Americans that         
         he freed.              

50
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,557
             You're in over     
             your head, Pea.    

51
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:23,693
         It was Africans        
         Abe Lincoln freed,     

52
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,629
         no more American       
         than Call, here.       

53
00:09:26,697 --> 00:09:28,798
     I'm American, by God.      

54
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,500
     You was born in Scotland,  

55
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:35,138
     though you was on the teat 
     when they brought you.     

56
00:09:36,573 --> 00:09:39,842
        I'm as American         
        as anybody              
        from Tennessee.         

57
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:51,154
 You boys can sleep             
 easy tonight                   

58
00:09:51,222 --> 00:09:53,089
 knowing Captain                
 Woodrow F. Call                

59
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,891
 is guarding the river,         

60
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,494
 keeping you safe               
 from Indians                   
 and Mexican bandits.           

61
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:01,965
         There ain't no         
         Indians no more.       

62
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:03,233
         We cleaned them out.   

63
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,734
         How about Blue Duck?   

64
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,469
             You never got him. 

65
00:10:06,537 --> 00:10:09,139
         No, we never got       
         that half-breed.       

66
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:11,140
 Blue Duck ain't                
 around here nowhere.           

67
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:14,176
 His range                      
 is further north.              

68
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,679
         How come the Captain   
         goes to the river?     

69
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:18,648
 He just misses                 
 the wild old days              

70
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:22,518
 when he had somebody           
 to outwit, that's all.         

71
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:27,756
         I'll whack that bell   
         if I want to.          

72
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:43,039
     What's the matter          
     with that knife, Bol?      

73
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:45,074
     Won't hold an edge?        

74
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,978
 It is like a wife.             

75
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:51,380
 Every night                    

76
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,016
 you better stroke it.          

77
00:10:55,485 --> 00:10:56,986
                 Your wife      
                 in Mexico      

78
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:59,155
                must be getting 
                rusty by now.   

79
00:10:59,222 --> 00:11:01,324
                 She don't get  
                 sharpened      
                 more than      

80
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:03,392
                 twice a year,  
                 does she, Bol? 

81
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,194
             She is old.        

82
00:11:05,261 --> 00:11:06,395
             Like you.          

83
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:09,532
         The older the violin,  
         the sweeter the music. 

84
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:12,268
         You ought to bring     
         her to meet me.        

85
00:11:12,335 --> 00:11:14,137
            No, I know you.     

86
00:11:14,204 --> 00:11:16,639
            You would try       
            to corrupt her.     

87
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:18,340
         How about one          
         of your daughters?     

88
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:20,810
         You've got nine,       
         ain't you?             

89
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:32,889
                 I don't see    
                 no scalps.     

90
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:37,559
             Good night to slip 
             into Mexico and    
             cross some stock.  

91
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:39,195
     Cross it and do what?      

92
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:42,531
     It ain't against           
     the law for you to work.   

93
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:45,334
 Can I go to Mexico?            

94
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:47,003
     I'm getting                
     old enough now.            

95
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,107
             You'll get old     
             quick if you sit   
             around talking.    

96
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,575
                 Best go on     
                 to bed.        

97
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,678
     It's still early,          
     Captain.                   

98
00:11:55,746 --> 00:11:58,848
         You go to bed now.     
         We got work tomorrow.  

99
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,449
        Yes, sir.               

100
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:10,193
         You ought to let him   
         set awhile.            

101
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:13,328
            The only            
            education he's got  
            is listening to me. 

102
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:16,733
         What kind of education 
         is that?               

103
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,967
     You think                  
     he'll learn more           

104
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:20,336
     shoveling horse            
     poop for you?              

105
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:24,139
         I shovel my share.     
         It ain't hurt me.      

106
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:29,178
        Fine, if that's         
        how you want to         
        make your fortune.      

107
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:32,115
 I think I'll straggle          
 down to that gin palace        

108
00:12:32,182 --> 00:12:36,252
 see if I can't                 
 scare me up a card game.       

109
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:44,293
         Now, you pigs...       

110
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:46,662
         You don't wait         
         up for me, now.        

111
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:58,040
 (KNOCK ON DOOR)                

112
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:00,943
 Evening, my good friend.       

113
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:03,780
 Mr. Gus,                       
 come in, come in.              

114
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:10,452
 Loan me $2.00,                 
 all right, Gus?                

115
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,989
             Why would I loan   
             money to a loafer? 

116
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:15,891
             You ought to be    
             trailing cattle.   

117
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,260
 I'm leaving next week          
 to do just that.               

118
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:20,630
 I'll pay you back.             

119
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:23,065
                Evening, Lorie. 
                You look fine.  

120
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:24,800
                 Real fine.     

121
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:29,839
 Listen, me and Lorie           
 are trying to talk.            

122
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:32,274
         Dish, you got          
         a sour stomach?        

123
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:35,345
         What you need is       
         a good game of cards.  

124
00:13:35,412 --> 00:13:37,213
             Ain't that right,  
             Lippy?             

125
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:40,416
             I didn't come in   
             to play no cards.  

126
00:13:43,553 --> 00:13:44,754
     How about you, Wanz?       

127
00:13:44,821 --> 00:13:46,088
         Put that rag away.     

128
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:50,493
    Most people wouldn't notice 
    dead skunks on the table.   

129
00:13:55,265 --> 00:13:57,300
         Put you in             
         a better mood.         

130
00:14:05,608 --> 00:14:07,877
        Nothing else to do      
        around here anyway.     

131
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,499
     Almost sunup.              

132
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:43,245
         How did anybody        
         that pretty wind up in 
         Lonesome Dove?         

133
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:45,981
        A gambler named         
        Tinkersley              

134
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:48,283
    left her here               
    a couple of years ago.      

135
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:50,419
     Before that,               
     he'd had her, uh...        

136
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:53,022
            sparking boys       
            in San Antone to    

137
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,523
             pay his debts.     

138
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:55,691
 Damn him.                      

139
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,193
             She didn't mind.   

140
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,195
             She was rat-holing 
             her tips,          

141
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:01,797
             trying to save     
             to get to          
             San Francisco.     

142
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:04,066
            He stole her money. 

143
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:07,703
             She caught him     
             drunk and tried    
             to shoot him.      

144
00:15:07,771 --> 00:15:10,673
             He beat her        
             black and blue.    

145
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,042
             Bit her lip, too.  

146
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,810
             That's how come    
             she got that scar. 

147
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:16,212
             That little scar.  

148
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,648
            I kind of like her. 

149
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:21,217
 You been with her?             

150
00:15:21,285 --> 00:15:23,486
             Sure, who ain't?   

151
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:26,855
     Even Wanz treats himself   
     once or twice a week.      

152
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:29,092
                 Of course,     

153
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,928
         she won't have nothing 
         to do with Lippy.      

154
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:36,698
        Here's that $2.00 you   
        wanted to borrow, Dish. 

155
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,367
         Go ahead, take it.     

156
00:15:38,435 --> 00:15:41,237
         Wouldn't want it said  
         I'd refuse a loan      
         to a friend.           

157
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:44,106
 Much obliged, then.            

158
00:15:44,174 --> 00:15:45,942
 I'll pay you back              
 this fall.                     

159
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:49,611
             No need to ride    
             off tonight, Dish. 

160
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,649
            Throw your blanket  
            on our front porch. 

161
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:57,486
 I appreciate that.             
 I do, I...                     

162
00:15:57,554 --> 00:16:00,356
 Darn, I think I left           
 something on the table.        

163
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:02,458
             Imagine that.      

164
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:04,927
             If it's all right  
             with you, Dish,    

165
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:05,995
             I won't wait.      

166
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:08,864
         No need.               
         You go on.             

167
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,657
             Get from here,     
             you pigs.          

168
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,925
             I ain't giving you 
             no biscuits.       

169
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:40,263
             Now go on, get.    
             Go on.             

170
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:49,238
 (DOOR OPENS)                   

171
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:56,245
            What's Dish Boggett 
            doing on            
            the front porch?    

172
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:58,414
 Well, sleeping,                
 unless you woke him.           

173
00:16:59,849 --> 00:17:01,984
 How's that horse bite?         

174
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:05,654
         Hell, I been           
         bit worse by bedbugs   
         in Saltillo.           

175
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:08,090
 Let me pour                    
 some axle grease on it.        

176
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:09,658
         Tend to your biscuits. 

177
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:12,795
         You up all night       
         reading the good book? 

178
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:15,564
     It's hard to have fun      
     in a place like this, but  

179
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,166
            I do my best.       

180
00:17:18,368 --> 00:17:19,701
                 Oh.            

181
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:23,605
     Biscuits are ready.        

182
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,443
                 We come here   
                 to make money. 

183
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:30,046
         There wasn't nothing   
         about fun in the deal. 

184
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:34,116
        You like money          
        even less than          
        you like fun,           

185
00:17:34,184 --> 00:17:35,484
 if that's possible.            

186
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:40,589
             Wake up, Newt.     

187
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:43,625
     You'll poke your eye       
     with your own fork.        

188
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:47,263
    See what happens            
    when you keep him           
    up all night talking.       

189
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:53,602
             Hurry, Pea.        

190
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:56,405
 It'll take a hacksaw           
 to cut them eggs,              
 the way                        

191
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:59,242
 frying them in                 
 coffee grounds, Bol.           

192
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:01,043
            I don't care.       

193
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,912
 Pea eye, it's bad manners      
 to go relieving yourself       

194
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,849
     where people               
     are eating breakfast.      

195
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,984
     What would                 
     your mama think?           

196
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:14,357
         Good morning.          

197
00:18:14,424 --> 00:18:15,958
             Morning, Dish.     
             Have some bacon.   

198
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:17,025
     Thanks, Captain.           

199
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:18,761
         You can work it off.   

200
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:21,496
     Work it off?               

201
00:18:21,564 --> 00:18:24,934
     Hey, come look who's       
     riding up the road.        

202
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:26,035
                 It ought       
                 to be Deets.   

203
00:18:26,102 --> 00:18:28,837
             He's due back      
             from San Antone.   

204
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:31,773
         It's Deets,            
         but not alone.         

205
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:42,851
                 That's Deets   
                 all right.     

206
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,420
     Who's the other one?       

207
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:48,457
             'I god, Woodrow,   
             that's Jake Spoon! 

208
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:49,758
     Danged if you              
     ain't right.               

209
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:51,993
     Lord, how long             
     has it been?               

210
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:53,828
                     10 years.  

211
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,140
         Well, howdy, boys.     

212
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,642
         What's for breakfast?  

213
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,578
             You're too late.   
             We ate.            

214
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,549
                You always      
                was a hog, Gus. 

215
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:18,354
             Captain.           
             Good to see you.   

216
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:20,289
     Where you been             
     all these years?           

217
00:19:20,857 --> 00:19:22,491
        Arkansas most recently. 

218
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,927
 Your horse                     
 looks like you                 
 left in a hurry.               

219
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:28,130
            Yeah,               
            that's true enough. 

220
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:31,433
                What you think, 
                Captain?        

221
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:32,834
                 Didn't I find  
                 the prodigal?  

222
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,303
     You did.                   

223
00:19:34,371 --> 00:19:36,438
     Bet it wasn't              
     in no church house.        

224
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,243
                 Pea, it's been 
                 a long time.   

225
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:43,345
 Thank you, Jake.               

226
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:45,748
     This is Dish Boggett.      
     He just signed on.         

227
00:19:45,816 --> 00:19:47,316
             I did?             

228
00:19:48,017 --> 00:19:49,752
                And who's this? 

229
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,054
             Don't you          
             remember me, Jake? 

230
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:53,955
             You used to buy me 
             hard candy.        

231
00:19:54,024 --> 00:19:56,225
         You gave me my first   
         ride on horseback.     

232
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:01,897
             My God!            

233
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:04,266
 Well, if it ain't Newt!        

234
00:20:04,334 --> 00:20:06,302
                 Little Newt!   

235
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:07,670
 I growed up, huh?              

236
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:09,605
                 You growed up  
                 good, Newt.    

237
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:10,773
 Thank you, Jake.               

238
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,542
 Woodrow makes sure             
 he sleeps.                     

239
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:15,811
 Deets, give his horse          
 a good feed.                   

240
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:18,146
 Probably been a while          
 since he's had one.            

241
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,053
             Didn't Deets       
             have that same cap 
             before I left?     

242
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,357
 Deets wouldn't quit            
 a garment 'cause               
 of a little age.               

243
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:31,260
 We can't all be                
 fine dressers like you.        

244
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:37,767
        Pea, you best get these 
        two boys to work        
        digging that well.      

245
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,003
     Well, now, Captain, I...   

246
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,638
 you don't mind                 
 doing a little                 
 well digging                   

247
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:44,774
 to pay for breakfast,          
 do you, Dish?                  

248
00:20:46,877 --> 00:20:48,343
             I don't guess so.  

249
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:58,153
     That old  <i>pistolero</i>        
    <i> you got for a cook</i>         

250
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:00,389
     has been cleaning his gun  
     on this towel.             

251
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:03,726
     There's worse              
     he wipes on it.            

252
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:06,161
         Where you been         
         all these years, Jake? 

253
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:07,963
 Seeing the country.            

254
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,432
 I was up in Montana            
 two years ago.                 

255
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,667
 Prettier land                  
 there never was,               

256
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:13,135
 'specially                     
 on Milk River.                 

257
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:15,170
 You can smell                  
 Canady from there.             

258
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:18,240
     Bet you can smell          
     Indians, too.              

259
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:22,144
 Yeah, but it's                 
 worth it seeing                
 all the grass.                 

260
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,212
 Grass everywhere.              

261
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,214
 You wouldn't believe it.       

262
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:28,083
 Plenty of water, too.          

263
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:29,351
                 I'd go today,  
                 if I could     

264
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:31,387
                 sprout wings   
                 and fly.       

265
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:32,921
             Be safer to walk.  

266
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:35,524
             Give somebody else 
             time to lick       
             the Indians.       

267
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,395
 The minute                     
 they are licked,               

268
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:41,397
 there's going to be            
 fortunes made in Montana.      

269
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:44,566
                 What are you   
                 saying, Jake?  

270
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:46,568
 I'm saying let's us            
 get to it first.               

271
00:21:46,636 --> 00:21:48,870
 Round up free cattle here,     
 drive them up.                 

272
00:21:48,938 --> 00:21:50,739
 We'd be rich.                  

273
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,175
 Land like you never seen.      

274
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:55,411
             We ain't seen you  
             in 10 years.       

275
00:21:55,478 --> 00:21:57,846
             Now you want us    
             to pack up,        

276
00:21:57,914 --> 00:22:01,283
             go north,          
             and get scalped.   

277
00:22:01,351 --> 00:22:03,952
 You were never afraid          
 of a few Indians.              

278
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,554
         We whupped them        
         down here,             

279
00:22:05,622 --> 00:22:07,389
     and they was Comanches.    

280
00:22:07,457 --> 00:22:10,559
         You were never a lover 
         of cows, neither.      

281
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:13,228
         Pretty whores, cards,  
         and clean shirts       

282
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:15,431
         was more your line.    

283
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:17,098
 Yeah, but I can                
 smell an opportunity           

284
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:19,501
     when it's                  
     under my nose.             

285
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:23,372
        What about that trouble 
        in Arkansas?            

286
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,674
 Mule Skinner threw down        
 on me in a saloon.             

287
00:22:25,742 --> 00:22:28,744
    Shot back at him            
    and killed a dentist.       

288
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,681
     Was a pure accident,       
     but I killed him.          

289
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:35,251
            He stood            
            in the wrong place? 

290
00:22:35,318 --> 00:22:36,785
        Actually,               
        he was outside          

291
00:22:36,852 --> 00:22:38,621
 walking down the street.       

292
00:22:38,688 --> 00:22:41,590
 A plank wall won't stop        
 no .50-caliber bullet.         

293
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:44,092
            But a dentist will. 

294
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:47,796
        Dropped him dead.       

295
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:49,464
         It was bad luck        
         all around.            

296
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:52,300
             Nobody likes       
             a dentist anyway.  

297
00:22:52,368 --> 00:22:54,136
 This one was the mayor.        

298
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:55,804
         Worse yet,             

299
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:57,039
         his brother's          
         the she...             

300
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:58,774
         his brother's          
         the sheriff.           

301
00:23:03,246 --> 00:23:06,081
     Young fellow named         
     July Johnson.              

302
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:07,949
 He was away at the time.       

303
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:10,853
     They wouldn't hang you     
     for an accident,           

304
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:13,455
     not even in Arkansas.      

305
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,089
     Since they don't           
     take much shine            
     to gamblers,               

306
00:23:15,157 --> 00:23:17,626
 I wasn't going                 
 to give them the option.       

307
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,467
 Good to see you boys.          

308
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:28,604
 I hardly thought               
 to find you still here.        

309
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:31,373
         Ain't nothing changed  
         much around here       

310
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:33,375
         since you left, Jake.  

311
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:36,945
 Little Newt                    
 sure surprised me.             

312
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:39,882
        Guess I thought         
        he was still            
        just a spud.            

313
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:41,683
     What about Maggie?         

314
00:23:45,688 --> 00:23:48,156
             Maggie's been dead 
             nine years, Jake.  

315
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:51,560
         Nine years.            

316
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:55,263
         I swear...             

317
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:59,534
     You've had little          
     Newt all this time.        

318
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:03,238
            Wasn't a whole      
            lot of people       

319
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:06,241
         scrambling to adopt    
         a dead whore's child.  

320
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:10,913
         Ain't that right,      
         Woodrow?               

321
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,781
         Well, it ain't         
         a holiday.             

322
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:15,017
         Let's help them        
         boys out there.        

323
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,454
 I swear.                       

324
00:24:19,522 --> 00:24:22,424
             It was only        
             the Christian      
             thing to do...     

325
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:24,693
             taking him in,     
             I mean.            

326
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:27,896
             One of you boys    
             is most likely     
             his dad.           

327
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:14,342
 July, get out here.            
 I want to talk to you.         

328
00:25:20,383 --> 00:25:22,417
                 Hello, Peach.  

329
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:24,853
 Where did you get              
 the rooster, Peach?            

330
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:26,855
         It's my rooster.       

331
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:30,826
     July, when do you aim      
     to start after Jake Spoon? 

332
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:32,594
                     Well...    

333
00:25:32,662 --> 00:25:34,563
 he'll get over                 
 to Mexico or somewhere         

334
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,798
     you sit around here        
     much longer...             

335
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:39,367
     Like you been doing.       

336
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:42,437
             The thing is,      
             Peach...           

337
00:25:42,505 --> 00:25:45,874
            I mean everybody    
            pretty much agrees  
            it was an accident. 

338
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:48,076
 Stop that, rooster!            

339
00:25:48,144 --> 00:25:50,645
 Benny was my husband           
 and your brother               

340
00:25:50,713 --> 00:25:52,347
     and the mayor              
     of this town.              

341
00:25:52,415 --> 00:25:54,616
 Now that ought to stand        
 for something, July.           

342
00:25:54,684 --> 00:25:55,851
                     It does... 

343
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,486
 You're the sheriff,            
 ain't you?                     

344
00:25:57,587 --> 00:25:59,320
 It's what you're paid for.     

345
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,858
             Well, that's true, 
             but you can't...   

346
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:06,495
 you never                      
 should have married            
 that woman, July.              

347
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:08,663
 Remember I warned you          
 about that?                    

348
00:26:10,934 --> 00:26:13,102
         Well, what's that      
         got to do with this,   
         Peach?                 

349
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:16,371
         I think you'd          
         rather stay home       
         than do your duty.     

350
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:17,706
 That's what I think.           

351
00:26:17,774 --> 00:26:21,143
         I never said I wasn't  
         going after him.       

352
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:24,212
         Oh, rooster!           

353
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:31,753
     Guess that will            
     teach him to peck me.      

354
00:26:32,622 --> 00:26:34,255
     Well, July...              

355
00:26:34,957 --> 00:26:37,292
     What about Jake Spoon?     

356
00:26:47,303 --> 00:26:48,670
         I expect to find him   

357
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:52,874
        down around San Antonio 
        somewhere, Peach.       

358
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,344
         I hear                 
         he has friends there.  

359
00:26:56,412 --> 00:26:58,914
        You catch him,          
        you hear me?            

360
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:00,582
                 I will, Peach. 

361
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,684
                 Don't worry.   

362
00:27:04,787 --> 00:27:07,556
     Now let's see how you like 
     the cook pot.              

363
00:27:16,032 --> 00:27:18,834
             Them friends       
             of Jake Spoon's... 

364
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:21,369
             they're two        
             of the most famous 
             Texas Rangers      

365
00:27:21,437 --> 00:27:23,605
             that ever lived.   
             You know that?     

366
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:29,277
     I don't suppose there's    
     a sporting woman around.   

367
00:27:29,345 --> 00:27:31,312
 Are you so rich                
 that's all you                 
 think about?                   

368
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,148
             I think about it,  
             rich or poor.      

369
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:38,687
 Get from here,                 
 you pigs.                      

370
00:27:38,754 --> 00:27:41,690
 Go hunt up another snake       
 or something.                  

371
00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:43,091
             Get!               

372
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,962
 Sit down, Jake.                
 Let's talk.                    

373
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:57,372
         Folks that keep pigs   
         ain't no better        
         than farmers.          

374
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:59,775
         I'm surprised          
         at you and Call.       

375
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:01,309
        I figured you'd         
        at least stay cattlemen 

376
00:28:01,377 --> 00:28:04,112
     after we quit rangering.   

377
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,315
 I thought you'd own            
 a railroad by now              

378
00:28:07,383 --> 00:28:09,785
     or at least                
     a whorehouse.              

379
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:13,021
 I guess life's                 
 disappointed us both.          

380
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:14,622
            I may not have made 
            no fortune,         

381
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,692
             but I never spoke  
             to a pig, neither. 

382
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:29,337
             In all your world  
             travels, Jake,     

383
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,675
        you didn't run across   
        Clara nowhere, did you? 

384
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:37,211
         She's still married    
         to that horse trader   
         Bob Allen,             

385
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,180
             if that's what     
             you're asking.     

386
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:40,682
             You saw her then?  

387
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,383
             Just for a minute  

388
00:28:42,451 --> 00:28:44,152
             outside a store    
             in Ogalalla.       

389
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:48,957
             Bob was with her,  
             so I wasn't asked  
             for supper.        

390
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:51,059
 Any young'uns?                 

391
00:28:51,193 --> 00:28:53,327
                 Two girls,     
                 I believe.     

392
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:55,496
                 I heard        
                 her boys died. 

393
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:57,432
             How did she look?  

394
00:28:57,499 --> 00:29:00,201
         Not as pretty          
         as she once was.       

395
00:29:00,269 --> 00:29:03,237
         It's been 15 years     
         since we courted her.  

396
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:08,009
            Nebraska, huh?      

397
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:10,912
         I went by there        
         on my way to Montana.  

398
00:29:13,082 --> 00:29:15,984
         Bob's close to rich,   
         did you know that?     

399
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:18,319
        Army gets most          
        of its horses from him. 

400
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:25,360
 First he gets Clara,           
 then he gets rich.             

401
00:29:25,427 --> 00:29:27,395
 'I god, imagine that.          

402
00:29:27,462 --> 00:29:30,398
 Him so dumb                    
 he can hardly walk             
 through a door                 

403
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:32,000
     without bumping            
     his head.                  

404
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:35,103
 Don't seem fair,               
 does it?                       

405
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,352
             Stop digging       
             when you get       
             to China.          

406
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,121
             You'll know        
             when you're there. 

407
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:55,190
             The men            
             wear pigtails.     

408
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,727
     If you hadn't loaned me    
     that $2.00,                

409
00:29:58,794 --> 00:30:00,962
         I'd be halfway         
         to Matagorda by now.   

410
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:03,732
         No need to thank me.   

411
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,108
             Easy, now.         

412
00:30:14,543 --> 00:30:16,644
                 Easy there.    

413
00:30:18,647 --> 00:30:20,349
         Want some help?        

414
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,383
                 Not from you,  
                 I don't.       

415
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:30,125
                 Where's Jake?  

416
00:30:30,193 --> 00:30:31,726
 Catching a nap.                

417
00:30:31,794 --> 00:30:33,295
                     Oh, man.   

418
00:30:33,362 --> 00:30:35,730
             He ain't changed   
             a bit, has he?     

419
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:38,766
 Look who's talking.            
 When did you

         want to do that?       

524
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:24,606
     It was an accident,        

525
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:26,941
     as everybody               
     with any sense knows.      

526
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:28,676
             I know...          

527
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:30,745
     Peach been bullying you    
     again, is that it?         

528
00:37:32,848 --> 00:37:34,415
     Wipe your lip, July.       

529
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:41,055
         Joe, run fetch         
         a bucket of water.     

530
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:49,697
 We been married                
 five months.                   

531
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:51,933
 Now you want to ride           
 off somewhere,                 

532
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,002
 and all because                
 of Peach.                      

533
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,405
         Well, that's my job,   
         Ellie.                 

534
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:59,240
             That's what        
             I get paid for.    

535
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:01,008
             If I start now,    

536
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:03,310
            I expect I'd        
            be back in a month. 

537
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:10,618
 Well, maybe you should         
 at that, July.                 

538
00:38:10,685 --> 00:38:12,487
             I think I should.  

539
00:38:13,188 --> 00:38:14,922
     Take Joe with you.         

540
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,290
                     Take Joe?  

541
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:18,793
             Ellie,             
             he's just a boy.   

542
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:20,528
             There could be     
             a fight.           

543
00:38:20,596 --> 00:38:24,165
     I doubt anybody'd          
     shoot a boy,               
     even in Texas.             

544
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:26,334
         I was thinking maybe   
         I'd take Roscoe.       

545
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:28,035
            Take Joe.           

546
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:29,270
        He's got                
        to grow up sometime.    

547
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:31,072
     It won't hurt him.         

548
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:32,206
             I don't know,      
             Ellie.             

549
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:33,841
     I know.                    

550
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:35,109
        I'll go tell him.       

551
00:38:57,165 --> 00:38:59,834
         Better to have that    
         if it's not needed     

552
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:02,603
         than to need it        
         and not have it.       

553
00:39:02,671 --> 00:39:05,139
     You pigs guard the place   
     while we're gone.          

554
00:39:57,158 --> 00:40:00,060
         They put               
         a gun on you.          

555
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:02,797
         Wouldn't be surprised  
         if they make you       
         boss of this outfit.   

556
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:04,298
 Better hope not, Deets.        

557
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:08,102
         I'd cut your wages     
         for always joshing me. 

558
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:34,795
             Big camp's just    
             a couple of miles  
             over that ridge.   

559
00:40:34,863 --> 00:40:36,631
 Some might think               
 it foolish,                    

560
00:40:36,698 --> 00:40:38,666
 stealing horses                
 from Pedro Flores.             

561
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:42,035
 He's got the best-armed        
 hundred vaqueros               
 in northern Mexico.            

562
00:40:42,103 --> 00:40:45,139
            They're spread      
            all around and      
            can't shoot anyhow. 

563
00:40:45,206 --> 00:40:47,642
 Most of this crowd             
 can't neither.                 

564
00:40:47,709 --> 00:40:49,877
 Dish is still                  
 half-drunk.                    

565
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:51,979
 Newt ain't ever                
 spilled blood.                 

566
00:40:52,046 --> 00:40:54,315
             I swear, Gus.      

567
00:40:54,383 --> 00:40:56,183
             You'd argue        
             with a possum.     

568
00:40:56,251 --> 00:40:58,586
 Be easier than arguing         
 with you, Woodrow.             

569
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:25,079
         How many you figure?   

570
00:41:25,147 --> 00:41:27,715
 I'd say 40                     
 or 50 head.                    

571
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:29,817
                 Speak up, Gus. 

572
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:31,719
         Talk a little louder   
         and them vaqueros      

573
00:41:31,787 --> 00:41:33,955
             probably bring us  
             the horses...      

574
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:36,724
             While they're      
             shooting at us.    

575
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:38,159
     We'll split up.            

576
00:41:38,226 --> 00:41:41,129
            Get ready to jump   
            some gullies, boys. 

577
00:41:54,843 --> 00:41:57,145
             (SINGING)          

578
00:42:00,582 --> 00:42:01,816
     Captain.                   

579
00:42:01,884 --> 00:42:03,117
            What is it?         

580
00:42:04,352 --> 00:42:05,987
 I hear singing.                

581
00:42:07,156 --> 00:42:09,157
 White folks singing.           

582
00:42:09,892 --> 00:42:11,225
             White folks?       

583
00:42:17,766 --> 00:42:19,466
 You hear anything?             

584
00:42:19,534 --> 00:42:21,035
                 Yes, I do.     

585
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:24,338
             I hear something,  
             but it sounds      
             like a bird.       

586
00:42:24,406 --> 00:42:27,775
     Hell, Deets                
     wouldn't stop              
     for no bird.               

587
00:42:27,843 --> 00:42:29,911
         No, sir,               
         I guess he wouldn't.   

588
00:42:35,584 --> 00:42:37,551
 Two of them.                   

589
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,788
 They got a donkey              
 and a mule.                    

590
00:42:40,856 --> 00:42:43,157
         That don't make        
         no sense at all.       

591
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:01,876
 Irishmen.                      

592
00:43:01,944 --> 00:43:04,612
         When did Pedro Flores  
         go to hiring Irishmen? 

593
00:43:12,554 --> 00:43:16,224
      Oh, whiskey made me      
     pawn me clothes            

594
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:19,693
      And whiskey              
     gave me a broken nose      

595
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:21,662
          Whiskey-o, Johnny-o  

596
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,697
                 Rise 'em up   
                from down below 

597
00:43:23,766 --> 00:43:25,532
             Whiskey, whiskey, 
            whiskey-o           

598
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,201
              Open up,         
             this jar must go   

599
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:30,905
             John, rise 'em up 
            from down below    

600
00:43:30,973 --> 00:43:32,673
                 Let's eat      
                 the donkey.    

601
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:34,909
                What's a donkey 
                good for?       

602
00:43:34,977 --> 00:43:39,013
     Teach it to sit            
     on its arse                
     and eat sugar cubes.       

603
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:40,982
         You men just           
         hold steady there.     

604
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:42,283
             Murderers, Allen!  

605
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,385
             Murderers! Heyaaa, 
             mule, heyaaa!      

606
00:43:44,452 --> 00:43:46,087
             Heyaaa! Heyaaa,    
             heyaaa, heyaaa!    

607
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:48,389
     I believe that mule's      
     hobbled, son.              

608
00:43:48,456 --> 00:43:50,224
     That's why                 
     his legs won't work.       

609
00:43:52,694 --> 00:43:55,997
         He's me brother,       
         but smart he ain't.    

610
00:43:56,064 --> 00:43:57,765
         I'm Allen O'Brien,     

611
00:43:57,833 --> 00:44:01,368
         and that would be      
         young Sean there       
         on the mule.           

612
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:04,205
                     Sir.       

613
00:44:05,473 --> 00:44:08,375
         Newt, you run          
         get the horses.        

614
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:10,077
             Yes, sir.          

615
00:44:10,145 --> 00:44:11,578
         You know               
         where you are?         

616
00:44:11,646 --> 00:44:14,548
        Not Ireland.            
        I know that much.       

617
00:44:14,616 --> 00:44:17,985
     How far are we             
     from Galveston, sir?       

618
00:44:18,053 --> 00:44:20,888
     Galveston?                 
     This is Mexico.            

619
00:44:20,956 --> 00:44:22,389
     Worse, the part            
     you're standing on         

620
00:44:22,457 --> 00:44:24,091
 belong to Pedro Flores.        

621
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,828
 He find you here,              
 he'll hang you sure.           

622
00:44:26,895 --> 00:44:29,297
                    Hang us?    
     Oh, yeah.                  

623
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:31,165
         Mr. Gus done           
         got the horses.        

624
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:33,567
 You boys best pack up          
 and go with us.                

625
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:36,203
                 We're packed.  

626
00:44:57,826 --> 00:44:58,926
 We being chased?

00:45:00,462 --> 00:45:02,330
     Jake's shooting off        
     his pistol like a fool.    

629

     Flores and his boys?       

632
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:28,489
                 I believe so.  

633
00:45:28,556 --> 00:45:30,324
 No wonder we ain't             
 been chased.                   

634
00:45:30,392 --> 00:45:33,294
 While we was in Mexico         
 stealing Flores' horses,       

635
00:45:33,362 --> 00:45:35,897
 he was back in Texas           
 stealing some others.          

636
00:45:35,964 --> 00:45:37,899

     We'll run                  
     straight at them,          

638
00:45:40,235 --> 00:45:42,503
 grab his herd,                 
 and kick for the river.        

639
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:45,072
    Be a good joke

            take money from me. 

663
00:48:43,018 --> 00:48:45,419
 That's because she             
 don't really know you yet.     

664
00:50:04,332 --> 00:50:07,801
         Roscoe can help        
         if you need anything.

            Yes, sir, I reckon.

673
00:51:29,384 --> 00:51:31,017
                Morning, Peach. 

674
00:51:31,086 --> 00:51:32,953
                Hello, Charlie. 

675
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:36,756
        I thought July told you 
        to look after Elmira.   

676
00:51:36,824 --> 00:51:39,493
     She said she don't want    
     no looking after.          

677
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:41,395
             We just got back   
             from the cabin,    

678
00:51:41,462 --> 00:51:43,530
                and she's gone. 

679
00:51:43,597 --> 00:51:45,065
             Gone?              

680
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:46,599
             Gone where?        

681
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:49,136
 Maybe on                       
 that whiskey boat.             

682
00:51:50,104 --> 00:51:51,805
             You mean,          

683
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:54,808
         she...she left town?   

684
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:58,945
             Well, why would    
             Elmira do a thing  
             like that?         

685
00:51:59,013 --> 00:52:02,115
     Well, who knows...         
     A woman like her.          

686
00:52:03,184 --> 00:52:06,453
        Maybe got her           
        another man somewhere.  

687
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:10,457
             But...but she's    
             July's wife.       

688
00:52:10,525 --> 00:52:12,859
        She's having            
        a baby, too.            

689
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:15,128
             A baby?            

690
00:52:15,196 --> 00:52:17,731
        July never said         
        nothing about no baby.  

691
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:19,667
     I doubt she                
     ever told him,             

692
00:52:19,734 --> 00:52:22,803
 but I seen her                 
 with the morning sickness.     

693
00:52:24,238 --> 00:52:26,340
             My God...          

694
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:28,642
         On a whiskey boat?     

695
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,977
     July ain't got the sense   
     God gave a turkey,         

696
00:52:31,045 --> 00:52:33,980
         or he'd never          
         have married her.      

697
00:52:34,048 --> 00:52:35,682
     You'd best go find him     
     and tell him               

698
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,684
     his wife's run away.       

699
00:52:37,752 --> 00:52:39,186
                     Well,      

700
00:52:39,254 --> 00:52:41,821
             July's gone        
             to Texas, Peach.   

701
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:44,090
                 He left        
                 six days ago.  

702
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,794
 Well, surely you               
 can find Texas, Roscoe.        

703
00:52:47,862 --> 00:52:49,530
             I can find Texas,  

704
00:52:49,597 --> 00:52:51,765
             but how            
             do I find July?    

705
00:52:51,832 --> 00:52:53,833
        Now, listen, Roscoe,    

706
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:55,435
     she ain't hardly worth it, 

707
00:52:55,503 --> 00:52:57,704
             but July dotes     
             on that woman.     

708
00:52:57,771 --> 00:52:59,339
         He'll want to find her 

709
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:02,509
        before she gets scalped 
        by the Indians.         

710
00:53:02,576 --> 00:53:05,211
         Now, you see to it,    
         you hear,              

711
00:53:05,347 --> 00:53:08,182
     or you'll be the one       
     gets blamed.               

712
00:53:08,249 --> 00:53:09,749
             All right, Peach.  

713
00:53:11,986 --> 00:53:14,654
            I don't know        
            nothing else to do. 

714
00:53:14,722 --> 00:53:16,956
     Charlie,                   
     don't stand in the sun     

715
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:19,026
     like you got no sense.     

716
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:38,978
    Sweet little thing. Mm-mmm! 

717
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:45,185
 Sure is a pretty thing,        
 ain't she?                     

718
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:55,061
                Aw, she's mine. 

719
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,414
     See that, did you?         

720
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:16,049
 What was it about?             

721
00:54:17,419 --> 00:54:18,452
             About you.         

722
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,353
 About me?                      

723
00:54:20,422 --> 00:54:22,656
         You're the only woman  
         we got.                

724
00:54:24,392 --> 00:54:26,693
         He would have taken    
         advantage of the fact. 

725
00:54:28,262 --> 00:54:30,130
             He won't now,      
             though, will he?   

726
00:54:30,197 --> 00:54:32,065
         No.                    

727
00:54:32,133 --> 00:54:34,835
             You took a chance  
             getting on a boat  

728
00:54:34,903 --> 00:54:36,670
            with a bunch of men 
            like us.            

729
00:54:36,738 --> 00:54:39,473
 You the one                    
 that done it?                  

730
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:41,774
                 Big Zwey.      

731
00:54:41,842 --> 00:54:44,544
                He done it.     
                He fancies you. 

732
00:54:44,612 --> 00:54:46,713
                Says he's going 
                to marry you.   

733
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,849
 He can't marry me.             
 I'm already married.           

734
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:53,587
 I'm going to Ogallala          
 to find my husband.            

735
00:54:53,654 --> 00:54:56,456
    Maybe you heard             
    of him...Dee Boot?          

736
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:00,193
        Big Zwey, he likes you. 

737
00:55:00,261 --> 00:55:01,795
     He's going to marry you.   

738
00:55:01,862 --> 00:55:05,298
    Tell him                    
    I got a husband.            

739
00:55:05,366 --> 00:55:07,334
         Give me a hand here.   
         Here we go!            

740
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:13,807
                You go tell him 
                yourself.       

741
00:55:37,365 --> 00:55:39,966
     Grab another one, boys.    

742
00:55:41,068 --> 00:55:42,835
 Watch...watch that!            

743
00:55:42,903 --> 00:55:44,337
 Cut that one                   
 over there!                    

744
00:55:44,405 --> 00:55:46,873
 Get him back over              
 in there!                      

745
00:56:00,688 --> 00:56:02,189
                How did you do? 

746
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:06,259
 About 50 head of steers.       

747
00:56:06,327 --> 00:56:08,061
        No trouble with Flores? 

748
00:56:08,128 --> 00:56:09,329
     He's dead.                 

749
00:56:09,397 --> 00:56:10,497
                 Dead?          

750
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:11,931
 Caught one                     
 of his vaqueros.               

751
00:56:11,999 --> 00:56:13,433
 He said old Pedro...           

752
00:56:15,436 --> 00:56:17,404
 died about a week ago.         

753
00:56:17,471 --> 00:56:20,006
             What did he do,    
             choke on a pepper? 

754
00:56:20,074 --> 00:56:23,710
 He just died.                  
 That's all.                    

755
00:56:23,777 --> 00:56:26,045
            I didn't know       
            you liked that      
            old bandit so much. 

756
00:56:26,113 --> 00:56:27,847
     I didn't say               
     I liked him.               

757
00:56:27,915 --> 00:56:31,150
 I didn't expect him            
 to die, I guess.               

758
00:56:31,219 --> 00:56:33,019
             He was             
             a rough old cob,   

759
00:56:33,087 --> 00:56:34,987
                 I'll say that  
                 for him.       

760
00:56:37,758 --> 00:56:40,093
 Fun's all over                 
 down here now.                 

761
00:56:40,628 --> 00:56:42,028
                     Fun?       

762
00:56:42,096 --> 00:56:43,363
                What would you  
                know about fun? 

763
00:56:43,431 --> 00:56:44,831
            You never had fun   
            in your whole life. 

764
00:56:44,898 --> 00:56:46,499
         Fun is my department.  

765
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:50,337
         I'll ride into town    
         and scare me up some.  

766
00:56:50,404 --> 00:56:53,573
 We got enough to do            
 right here.                    

767
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:55,908
         I'm keeping everything 
         in balance.            

768
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:57,477
             You do more work   
             than you got to,   

769
00:56:57,545 --> 00:57:00,480
         so it's my obligation  
         to do less.            

770
00:57:08,922 --> 00:57:11,058
 Where the hell's               
 he going?                      

771
00:57:32,647 --> 00:57:36,349
             Hello, Jasper.     
             Ain't seen you     
             in a while.        

772
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:39,118
 Is that girl in there          
 gone and got married?          

773
00:57:39,186 --> 00:57:40,854
     Whenever I                 
     jingle my money,           

774
00:57:40,955 --> 00:57:44,424
 she looks like she's           
 ready to carve my liver.       

775
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:48,928
 Never was but one thing        
 worth doing here.              

776
00:57:48,996 --> 00:57:51,364
     Now I can't                
     even do that!              

777
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:56,603
 I hear you and Call            
 are raising a herd.            

778
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:59,372
             Well, you're       
             about half-right.  

779
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,574
                    Call is.    

780
00:58:02,076 --> 00:58:03,977
             He still           
             taking on hands?   

781
00:58:04,044 --> 00:58:06,179
 He'd find                      
 a place for you.               

782
00:58:06,246 --> 00:58:07,881
     Don't look like            
     you eat much.              

783
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:09,449
 He's with the herd about       

784
00:58:09,517 --> 00:58:11,618
 five miles                     
 yonder ways.                   

785
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,624
             Lorie, darlin'.    

786
00:58:20,328 --> 00:58:21,928
             Lippy.             

787
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:51,825
                 You and me.    

788
00:58:58,298 --> 00:59:00,133
             How about a poke?  

789
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:03,336
 I'm with Jake now,             
 Gus.                           

790
00:59:03,403 --> 00:59:05,138
 You know that.                 

791
00:59:05,205 --> 00:59:07,874
         Yeah, I do know that,  
         honey.                 

792
00:59:07,942 --> 00:59:10,176
         When I saw Jake riding 
         up to Lonesome Dove,   

793
00:59:10,244 --> 00:59:12,946
         I knew you and him     
         was settling together. 

794
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:15,481
        But Call got him        
        to work this afternoon, 

795
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,383
     so there ain't no reason   

796
00:59:17,451 --> 00:59:19,786
         you shouldn't sell me  
         a poke.                

797
00:59:20,621 --> 00:59:22,956
     I told you the reason.     

798
00:59:23,024 --> 00:59:24,757
 Jake takes care of me now.     

799
00:59:24,826 --> 00:59:27,127
         Jake's never           
         taken care of nobody   
         his whole life.        

800
00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:30,063
            Somebody's always   
            taking care of him. 

801
00:59:30,131 --> 00:59:32,199
         It was me and Call.    

802
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:34,534
             Now it's you.      

803
00:59:34,602 --> 00:59:36,402
             Ain't that right?  

804
00:59:37,772 --> 00:59:39,139
             You aiming         
             to marry him?      

805
00:59:39,207 --> 00:59:41,974
 We ain't                       
 talked about it.               

806
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:43,877
 He is taking me to             
 San Francisco, though.         

807
00:59:43,945 --> 00:59:45,045
                 Think so, huh? 

808
00:59:47,114 --> 00:59:50,283
 He promised.                   
 I'll hold him to it.           

809
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:51,518
             Jake's slippery    
             like an eel.       

810
00:59:51,585 --> 00:59:55,287
            My guess is         
            he'll use the drive 
            to leave you.       

811
00:59:55,355 --> 00:59:58,391
     If Jake's going,           
     I'm going, too.            

812
00:59:58,458 --> 00:59:59,893
     You'd be welcome           
     as far as I'm concerned,   

813
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,428
         but Call ain't         
         tolerant of women.     

814
01:00:03,931 --> 01:00:05,498
 I'm going.                     

815
01:00:05,566 --> 01:00:06,967
 It's a free country,           
 ain't it?                      

816
01:00:07,034 --> 01:00:10,036
        If you work for         
        Woodrow Call, it ain't. 

817
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:13,039
             I...I tell you...  

818
01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:16,108
             I'll give you...   

819
01:00:17,445 --> 01:00:19,045
             $50 for the poke.  

820
01:00:20,681 --> 01:00:21,981
             $50?               

821
01:00:22,783 --> 01:00:25,084
         I'll give you $50.     

822
01:00:25,152 --> 01:00:27,086
         Even if you            
         had $50, Lippy,        

823
01:00:27,154 --> 01:00:28,621
     the answer's still no.     

824
01:00:29,723 --> 01:00:31,524
             I tell you what.   

825
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:32,892
             Let's cut cards.   

826
01:00:33,828 --> 01:00:35,929
         Now, if you're high,   

827
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:37,597
             you win the $50,   

828
01:00:37,665 --> 01:00:39,466
             and you can        
             forget the poke.   

829
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:41,133
             Now, if I'm high,  

830
01:00:41,201 --> 01:00:44,136
            I'll still give you 
            the $50,            

831
01:00:44,204 --> 01:00:45,705
            but I get the poke. 

832
01:00:45,773 --> 01:00:47,039
                 All right?     

833
01:00:48,276 --> 01:00:51,844
 Well, what about Jake?         
 He's your good friend.         

834
01:00:51,946 --> 01:00:53,146
             I ain't trying     
             to cut Jake out.   

835
01:00:53,214 --> 01:00:54,647
            I just want a poke, 

836
01:00:54,715 --> 01:00:56,817
             and you might need 
             the $50.           

837
01:01:07,427 --> 01:01:09,129
                     Hmm.       

838
01:01:22,843 --> 01:01:24,377
 You cheated,                   
 didn't you?                    

839
01:01:24,444 --> 01:01:26,145
             Wouldn't say       
             I did or didn't,   

840
01:01:26,213 --> 01:01:28,715
             but a man          
             who wouldn't cheat 
             for a poke         

841
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:30,817
                 don't want one 
                 bad enough.    

842
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:32,819
             Come on, darlin'.  

843
01:01:39,126 --> 01:01:41,561
      Sleep, oh, babe          

844
01:01:41,629 --> 01:01:44,230
     For the grave becomes     

845
01:01:44,298 --> 01:01:45,732
          More silent          

846
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:48,368
      While it's full          

847
01:01:49,003 --> 01:01:50,337
              Evil             

848
01:01:50,404 --> 01:01:53,039
     From the grave a-comes    

849
01:01:54,608 --> 01:01:58,745
      To wrap the world        
     enthralled...             

850
01:01:58,812 --> 01:02:00,713
     It's a lucky herd,         
     ain't it?                  

851
01:02:00,781 --> 01:02:04,517
     Got a fine Irish baritone  
     to sing to them.           

852
01:02:04,585 --> 01:02:06,686
         He sings too sad       
         to suit me.            

853
01:02:15,729 --> 01:02:17,463
     Well, hello there, Jake.   

854
01:02:17,531 --> 01:02:20,633
     Wait till I eat my stew.   
     I'll help you down.        

855
01:02:20,701 --> 01:02:22,535
 I ain't getting down.          

856
01:02:22,603 --> 01:02:25,171
 Hand me a plate.               
 I'll eat up here.              

857
01:02:25,238 --> 01:02:27,406
         You sound              
         plum grumpy.           

858
01:02:27,474 --> 01:02:31,010
             I guess one day's  
             honest work don't  
             agree with you.    

859
01:02:31,078 --> 01:02:33,279
             Or is it just      
             any work at all?   

860
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:38,117
 You're one to talk.            

861
01:02:38,185 --> 01:02:39,986
     Where you been             
     all afternoon?             

862
01:02:40,054 --> 01:02:43,056
            I was playing cards 
            with Lorie.         

863
01:02:43,123 --> 01:02:46,459
         The poor girl thinks   
         you're taking her      
         to San Francisco.      

864
01:02:46,526 --> 01:02:48,527
     That ain't                 
     your business.             

865
01:02:48,595 --> 01:02:50,897
         She'll go              
         where I say            

866
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:53,466
 or get left behind one.        

867
01:02:53,534 --> 01:02:55,802
             Why not bring her  
             on the drive?      

868
01:02:55,869 --> 01:02:57,137
 On the drive?                  

869
01:02:57,204 --> 01:02:58,671
                 It's safer     
                 than you two   

870
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:00,840
             just striking out  
             on your own,       

871
01:03:00,908 --> 01:03:03,109
             especially through 
             Indian country.    

872
01:03:03,176 --> 01:03:06,579
     Call'd never allow         
     women in camp.             

873
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:09,682
            Call ain't God,     
            are you?            

874
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:10,617
            What?               

875
01:03:10,684 --> 01:03:13,786
                I was telling   
                Jake here       
                you ain't God.  

876
01:03:13,854 --> 01:03:15,454
                 You ain't,     
                 are you?       

877
01:03:15,522 --> 01:03:17,389
     Couple more                
     drags through Mexico,      

878
01:03:17,457 --> 01:03:20,126
         we'll be able to start 
         up the trail Monday.   

879
01:03:22,696 --> 01:03:24,563
         How does that          
         suit you, Jake?        

880
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:26,899
     It don't need              
     to suit me.                

881
01:03:26,967 --> 01:03:30,469
 I don't know that I feel       
 like bumping cows anymore.     

882
01:03:30,537 --> 01:03:33,139
         You ain't going        
         on the drive?          

883
01:03:33,207 --> 01:03:35,308
             Jake's got         
             his own fancies    
             to cultivate.      

884
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:37,911
                 He don't care  
                 that he caused 
                 all this.      

885
01:03:37,978 --> 01:03:40,246
 I didn't cause                 
 anything.                      

886
01:03:40,314 --> 01:03:43,249
         Who said Montany's     
         a cowman's paradise?   

887
01:03:43,317 --> 01:03:45,018
 Well, it is.                   

888
01:03:45,086 --> 01:03:46,152
         You know the country.  

889
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:49,288
         We was counting on you 
         to choose the way.     

890
01:03:49,356 --> 01:03:52,058
 I ain't decided                
 for sure yet.                  

891
01:03:52,126 --> 01:03:53,059
             Well, that's fine. 

892
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:54,794
                 Let us know    
                 when you do.   

893
01:03:55,562 --> 01:03:57,563
 Yeah, I will.                  

894
01:04:02,203 --> 01:04:03,903
 Think he'll                    
 go with us?                    

895
01:04:03,971 --> 01:04:06,239
         I'll tell you          
         what I think.          

896
01:04:06,307 --> 01:04:08,908
        I think Jake's always   
        been too leaky a vessel 

897
01:04:08,976 --> 01:04:11,211
         for anybody to put     
         much hope in.          

898
01:04:15,382 --> 01:04:17,449
 Going to town, Jake?           

899
01:04:22,156 --> 01:04:25,291
      Sleep, oh, babe          

900
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:26,959
          For the              

901
01:04:27,027 --> 01:04:29,729
      Grave becomes...        

902
01:04:37,137 --> 01:04:38,738
 What's wrong, Sean?            

903
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,008
             I miss me mother.  

904
01:04:42,776 --> 01:04:44,911
 Back in Ireland?               

905
01:04:46,246 --> 01:04:48,347
 Well, don't worry.             

906
01:04:48,415 --> 01:04:50,349
 I'm sure you'll                
 see her again someday.         

907
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:53,953
             No. She died...    

908
01:04:54,021 --> 01:04:56,856
                 Before me      
                 and me brother 
                 left home.     

909
01:04:56,924 --> 01:04:58,725
                Otherwise, I'd  
                still be there. 

910
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:00,726
 Mine died, too,                
 you know.                      

911
01:05:00,794 --> 01:05:02,561
                 You miss her?  

912
01:05:02,629 --> 01:05:04,263
                Like I been     
                missing mine?   

913
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:06,632
     Sometimes.                 

914
01:05:09,937 --> 01:05:11,838
     Oh, yeah...                

915
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:14,840
 Yeah, I do miss her.           

916
01:05:15,776 --> 01:05:17,710
            What about your pa? 

917
01:05:19,112 --> 01:05:21,514
 I don't know nothing           
 about him.                     

918
01:05:22,716 --> 01:05:24,684
                Me pa           
                was a drunkard. 

919
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:27,687
            He fell down a well 
            and drownded.       

920
01:05:27,754 --> 01:05:31,757
             He only came home  
             to beat me anyway. 

921
01:05:31,825 --> 01:05:33,993
 At least                       
 you knew who he was.           

922
01:05:35,462 --> 01:05:38,130
         Ah, it's me ma I miss. 

923
01:06:01,955 --> 01:06:03,990
 Don't go up there              
 with him.                      

924
01:06:04,057 --> 01:06:06,226
 Please. Don't.                 

925
01:06:06,293 --> 01:06:08,094
                     I have to. 

926
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:21,307
 I'm sandy.                     

927
01:06:21,374 --> 01:06:23,843
         I should have bathed   
         in the river.          

928
01:06:25,445 --> 01:06:27,613
             Want me            
             to fill you a tub? 

929
01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:29,148
 Maybe later.                   

930
01:06:34,288 --> 01:06:37,223
         What was Gus           
         up to today?           

931
01:06:37,291 --> 01:06:39,458
 He didn't come back            
 till sundown.                  

932
01:06:41,862 --> 01:06:43,429
         He was here a while.   

933
01:06:45,399 --> 01:06:48,635
             He offered me $50. 

934
01:06:48,635 --> 01:06:51,070
 Gus always was                 
 a fool with his money.         

935
01:06:52,406 --> 01:06:54,073
             I turned him down, 
             though.            

936
01:06:54,141 --> 01:06:56,309
             I said             
             I was with you.    

937
01:06:59,779 --> 01:07:01,280
    I reckon                    
    he got his poke.            

938
01:07:03,484 --> 01:07:05,451
 If I'm wrong,                  
 you can hit me back.           

939
01:07:10,891 --> 01:07:13,125
         We cut cards for it.   

940
01:07:13,193 --> 01:07:15,328
             I can't prove it,  
             but I know         
             he cheated.        

941
01:07:20,633 --> 01:07:23,635
 Should have warned you         
 about cutting cards            
 with that old cud.             

942
01:07:27,207 --> 01:07:29,175
 If it had been                 
 anybody but him,               

943
01:07:30,543 --> 01:07:31,911
 I'd have shot you.             

944
01:07:49,663 --> 01:07:51,164
                 You going      
                 with the herd? 

945
01:07:51,998 --> 01:07:54,100
         I ain't decided.       

946
01:07:54,168 --> 01:07:56,702
         They don't leave       
         till Monday.           

947
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:59,438
             You ain't planning 
             on leaving me here 

948
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:01,340
             if you do go,      

949
01:08:01,408 --> 01:08:03,709
             are you, Jake?     

950
01:08:05,245 --> 01:08:07,179
     All of them cowboys        
     in love with you?          

951
01:08:08,048 --> 01:08:09,281
         I'd have to kill       
         half of them           

952
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:11,918
         before we got          
         to Red River.          

953
01:08:12,753 --> 01:08:14,887
         They won't bother me.  

954
01:08:14,954 --> 01:08:17,589
     Gus is the only one        
     with enough guts to try.   

955
01:08:17,657 --> 01:08:21,627
     Yeah. He'd want            
     to cut the cards           
     twice a day.               

956
01:08:23,564 --> 01:08:25,431
            I'm going with you, 
            Jake,               

957
01:08:25,499 --> 01:08:28,267
         whether you go         
         on the drive or not.   

958
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:31,103
             I'm going          
             when you leave.    

959
01:08:31,171 --> 01:08:34,907
         Maybe we'll go         
         to San Antone          
         and gamble a spell.    

960
01:08:34,975 --> 01:08:36,909
             I've been.         

961
01:08:36,977 --> 01:08:38,811
     I don't want to go back.   

962
01:08:38,879 --> 01:08:40,946
    Ain't you                   
    the hard one to please?     

963
01:08:41,014 --> 01:08:44,116
             Well, no, I ain't. 

964
01:08:44,184 --> 01:08:46,686
             I just want to go  
             to San Francisco,  

965
01:08:47,554 --> 01:08:50,790
         like you promised me.  

966
01:08:50,857 --> 01:08:53,559
         That would please me   
         just fine.             

967
01:08:58,165 --> 01:09:01,267
 I ain't going to run off       
 and leave you, Lorie,          

968
01:09:02,369 --> 01:09:04,170
     if that's                  
     what you think.            

969
01:09:06,273 --> 01:09:08,073
        I know you ain't, Jake. 

970
01:09:11,478 --> 01:09:13,912
         (ROOSTER CROWS)        

971
01:09:37,304 --> 01:09:38,337
     Morning.                   

972
01:09:39,939 --> 01:09:40,939
                    Morning.    

973
01:09:41,675 --> 01:09:43,041
         You're up awful early. 

974
01:09:45,445 --> 01:09:47,246
             Jake,              
             let's leave today. 

975
01:09:47,314 --> 01:09:48,514
                 Today?         

976
01:09:53,654 --> 01:09:55,888
             Go and buy me      
             a horse, will you? 

977
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,891
                 One that's not 
                 too tall.      

978
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:00,626
                 Here's $50.    

979
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:05,098
     This Gus' money?           

980
01:10:07,301 --> 01:10:08,634
                     It was.    

981
01:10:25,018 --> 01:10:26,185
         Well...                

982
01:10:27,521 --> 01:10:29,121
     I bet a nickel.            

983
01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:32,391
     Get ready to shed          
     a tear or two.             

984
01:10:32,459 --> 01:10:33,725
         Ain't afraid of you.   

985
01:10:33,793 --> 01:10:35,962
 I ain't scared, neither.       

986
01:10:36,029 --> 01:10:37,797
 How about you, Jasper?         

987
01:10:41,702 --> 01:10:43,068
 You going to play cards        

988
01:10:43,136 --> 01:10:44,837
     or just sit there          
     looking ugly?              

989
01:10:46,106 --> 01:10:48,641
         What's he doing        
         with that?             

990
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:50,309
     That's supper.             

991
01:10:50,377 --> 01:10:52,311
    Bol will make stew          
    with that.                  

992
01:10:52,379 --> 01:10:54,447
                I ain't eating  
                no rattlesnake. 

993
01:10:57,618 --> 01:11:00,419
 I guess Dish don't want        
 no snake supper neither.       

994
01:11:01,121 --> 01:11:02,521
                Hey, it's Jake. 

995
01:11:05,792 --> 01:11:07,226
             And Miss Lorena.   

996
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:15,000
 Lorie, darlin'.                

997
01:11:16,169 --> 01:11:18,504
 That's a fine-looking          
 horse you're riding.           

998
01:11:18,572 --> 01:11:21,707
         Jake bought her for me 
         from Mary Pumphrey.    

999
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:24,777
 Well, I'm surprised            
 she'd sell her.                

1000
01:11:24,844 --> 01:11:27,513
     Well, I had                
     $50 to spend, Gus.         

1001
01:11:28,582 --> 01:11:30,383
 Money well spent, Jake...      

1002
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,750
         Both times.            

1003
01:11:45,499 --> 01:11:47,232
     Howdy, Call.               

1004
01:11:49,169 --> 01:11:51,236
             You never met      
             Lorena Wood.       

1005
01:11:51,304 --> 01:11:52,738
     No. We've not met.         

1006
01:11:54,374 --> 01:11:56,742
 Well, Jake, I see              
 you've made your decision.     

1007
01:11:56,810 --> 01:12:01,180
 We decided to try our luck     
 in San Francisco.              

1008
01:12:01,247 --> 01:12:03,048
    We'll enjoy                 
    the cool weather.           

1009
01:12:03,116 --> 01:12:04,484
     It's a hard trip.          

1010
01:12:04,551 --> 01:12:08,920
    Jake ain't one to be        
    put off by hardship.        

1011
01:12:08,988 --> 01:12:12,958
     We hope to ease            
     along with you             
     till Denver.               

1012
01:12:13,026 --> 01:12:15,427
 It's a free country, Jake.     
 Do as you please.              

1013
01:12:16,763 --> 01:12:19,265
 Guess we'll find a ridge       
 to camp on,                    

1014
01:12:19,332 --> 01:12:23,502
 somewhere upwind from these    
 stinking beasts of yours.      

1015
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:25,804
 See you boys                   
 on the trail somewhere.        

1016
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,774
        Lorie.                  

1017
01:12:32,812 --> 01:12:34,213
            Woodrow...          

1018
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:37,082
                Let's go        
                if we're going. 

1019
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:40,586
 I was thinking of making       
 another run to Mexico.         

1020
01:12:40,654 --> 01:12:42,721
         We got enough cattle   
         to stock five ranches. 

1021
01:12:42,789 --> 01:12:44,423
                     Let's go.  

1022
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:46,425
 Boys,                          
 check your gear.               

1023
01:12:46,493 --> 01:12:49,027
 We'll be leaving               
 first light                    
 in the morning.                

1024
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:53,765
             Captain, how far   
             is it up north?    

1025
01:12:53,833 --> 01:12:57,236
 Up north                       
 ain't a place, Newt.           
 It's a direction.              

1026
01:12:57,304 --> 01:12:59,771
 Where we're going              
 is about 2,500 miles           
 that-away.                     

1027
01:13:01,541 --> 01:13:03,141
                 2,500 miles?   

1028
01:13:09,449 --> 01:13:12,084
 Now where are you              
 off to?                        

1029
01:13:12,152 --> 01:13:14,086
            I forgot something. 

1030
01:13:14,154 --> 01:13:15,387
             Now, if I ain't    
             back in a month,   

1031
01:13:15,455 --> 01:13:18,490
             you girls          
             start without me.  

1032
01:13:18,559 --> 01:13:20,259
                     Ya!        

1033
01:13:55,429 --> 01:13:57,496
        You pigs                
        take care of the place. 

1034
01:13:57,564 --> 01:13:59,598
            It's all yours now. 

1035
01:14:00,534 --> 01:14:01,801
             Nobody else's.     

1036
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:53,418
 I see the morning rush         
 ain't started yet.             

1037
01:14:53,486 --> 01:14:55,688
     It will never              
     start again.               

1038
01:14:56,623 --> 01:14:58,424
        Not ever again.         

1039
01:15:03,329 --> 01:15:04,797
         Don't take it          
         so hard, Xavier.       

1040
01:15:04,865 --> 01:15:06,966
     There's plenty of whores.  

1041
01:15:08,668 --> 01:15:09,835
                 Ride up        
                 to San Antone  

1042
01:15:09,903 --> 01:15:11,403
     and recruit you another.   

1043
01:15:13,573 --> 01:15:15,607
 I would have                   
 given her money,               

1044
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:18,077
 bought her clothes.            

1045
01:15:19,512 --> 01:15:21,814
 I love her.                    

1046
01:15:21,882 --> 01:15:23,082
             Aw, hell,          
             we all love her,   

1047
01:15:23,149 --> 01:15:25,283
                 every dern     
                 one of us.     
                 You know that. 

1048
01:15:26,786 --> 01:15:27,853
     Yes...                     

1049
01:15:29,489 --> 01:15:31,824
 But I would have               
 married her.                   

1050
01:15:58,652 --> 01:16:00,352
             If it helps any,   
             it's my opinion    

1051
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,521
             she made           
             a poor bargain,    

1052
01:16:02,589 --> 01:16:04,823
         going with Jake Spoon. 

1053
01:16:06,459 --> 01:16:07,860
 Thank you.                     

1054
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:16,668
                     Well...    

1055
01:16:19,906 --> 01:16:22,908
 Goodbye, my fine friend.       

1056
01:16:22,975 --> 01:16:25,544
                Goodbye to you, 
                my good friend. 

1057
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:26,879
     Goodbye.                   

1058
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:39,191
             What are you doing 
             in my wagon?       

1059
01:16:39,259 --> 01:16:41,293
 Jumped off the roof.           
 Here's where I landed.         

1060
01:16:41,361 --> 01:16:44,463
             This wagon's       
             going to Montana.  

1061
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:46,331
 Yes, sir,                      
 and I am, too.                 

1062
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:48,533
 Piano playing's                
 finished around here.          

1063
01:16:49,302 --> 01:16:51,904
            Well,               
            we got two Irishmen 

1064
01:16:51,972 --> 01:16:54,306
             and a bunch        
             of addled-brained  
             cowboys.           

1065
01:16:54,374 --> 01:16:56,575
             I guess we could   
             always use a man   

1066
01:16:56,643 --> 01:16:58,811
             who wears          
             a chamber pot      
             on his head.       

1067
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:02,347
            Come on, mules. Ya! 

1068
01:18:11,884 --> 01:18:14,686
                 Go on, Pea!    
                 Pick it up!    

1069
01:18:57,229 --> 01:18:58,897
             Run them out, now! 

1070
01:19:03,836 --> 01:19:05,671
 Funny, ain't it?               

1071
01:19:05,738 --> 01:19:09,174
 All them cattle                
 and 9/10 of the horses         
 are stolen,                    

1072
01:19:09,242 --> 01:19:11,543
 and yet we was once            
 respected lawmen.              

1073
01:19:16,549 --> 01:19:19,018
     How many head you think    
     we're starting out with?   

1074
01:19:19,085 --> 01:19:20,519
                     Oh, about  

1075
01:19:20,586 --> 01:19:23,522
                 2,600 cattle   
                 and two pigs.  

1076
01:19:24,924 --> 01:19:26,091
                 That was       
                 dang stupid,   

1077
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,294
             bringing that sign 
             along.             

1078
01:19:28,361 --> 01:19:30,328
             You'll have us     
             the laughingstock  
             of this country    

1079
01:19:30,396 --> 01:19:33,665
     with that                  
     "We don't rent pigs" Part. 

1080
01:19:35,769 --> 01:19:38,003
 I figure it's better           
 to say it up front.            

1081
01:19:38,071 --> 01:19:40,606
 The man that does              
 like to rent pigs,             

1082
01:19:40,673 --> 01:19:42,074
 he's hard to stop.             

1083
01:19:42,141 --> 01:19:43,208
             If that            
             ain't bad enough,  

1084
01:19:43,275 --> 01:19:45,110
             you got            
             them Greek words.  

1085
01:19:45,177 --> 01:19:47,946
 I told you                     

1086
01:19:48,014 --> 01:19:49,648
 it ain't Greek,                
 it's Latin.                    

1087
01:19:49,716 --> 01:19:52,450
             What does it say,  
             that Latin?        

1088
01:19:52,518 --> 01:19:55,353
 Well, it's a motto.            
 It just says itself.           

1089
01:19:55,421 --> 01:19:57,388
        Yo varum, yo vara-feet. 

1090
01:19:57,456 --> 01:19:59,124
             Yo varum           
             double feet...     

1091
01:19:59,191 --> 01:20:01,326
             You don't know     
             what it says.      

1092
01:20:01,393 --> 01:20:05,164
             You found that     
             in some book       
             or something.      

1093
01:20:05,231 --> 01:20:07,266
             Maybe              
             it invites people  
             to rob us.         

1094
01:20:07,334 --> 01:20:11,370
     Anyone comes along         
     that reads Latin           
     is welcome to rob us.      

1095
01:20:12,505 --> 01:20:13,738
 I'd like the chance            

1096
01:20:13,806 --> 01:20:16,574
 to shoot an                    
 educated man once.             

1097
01:20:26,886 --> 01:20:28,187
                 Jake!          

1098
01:20:28,254 --> 01:20:31,290
             Jake, stop that!   

1099
01:20:31,358 --> 01:20:33,125
 I didn't hit you,              
 did I?                         

1100
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:35,327
        I was shooting          
        at the turtle.          

1101
01:20:35,395 --> 01:20:38,163
     Lucky you hit the river,   
     drunk as you are.          

1102
01:20:43,569 --> 01:20:45,504
             How's your thumb?  

1103
01:20:47,273 --> 01:20:48,673
     All this over              

1104
01:20:48,741 --> 01:20:50,309
     a little old               
     Mesquite thorn.            

1105
01:20:50,376 --> 01:20:52,644
     Ain't that                 
     something...ow!            

1106
01:20:52,712 --> 01:20:55,113
            It's made you sick, 
            Jake.               

1107
01:20:55,181 --> 01:20:57,449
 Why'd I get                    
 such a fancy for you?          

1108
01:20:57,516 --> 01:21:00,385
 Come on down here              
 with me. Come on.              

1109
01:21:02,121 --> 01:21:04,690
         Why don't I make you   
         some coffee instead?   

1110
01:21:18,772 --> 01:21:20,872
 How do, Miss?                  

1111
01:21:25,812 --> 01:21:27,412
         I'm Deets.             

1112
01:21:27,479 --> 01:21:28,947
     Captain sent me ahead      

1113
01:21:29,015 --> 01:21:31,750
     to scout a good place      
     to cross the herd.         

1114
01:21:32,985 --> 01:21:34,052
                 Oh...          

1115
01:21:35,055 --> 01:21:36,788
     Mr. Jake napping, huh?     

1116
01:21:38,624 --> 01:21:41,359
             He's caught        
             a Mesquite thorn   
             in his hand.       

1117
01:21:42,195 --> 01:21:43,795
     Better take a look.        

1118
01:21:52,705 --> 01:21:54,873
             Mesquite thorns... 

1119
01:21:54,941 --> 01:21:56,808
                    bad poison. 

1120
01:22:03,983 --> 01:22:05,416
         Deets?                 

1121
01:22:05,484 --> 01:22:07,485
 Where'd you come from?         

1122
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:09,420
 We're all right now, Lorie.    

1123
01:22:09,488 --> 01:22:11,456
 Deets                          
 will see us through.           

1124
01:22:11,523 --> 01:22:13,125
             You full of fever. 

1125
01:22:13,192 --> 01:22:15,961
             I'm going to dig   
             this sticker       
             out of you.        

1126
01:22:20,099 --> 01:22:22,500
         I'd soon               
         cut off my hand        
         as have you            

1127
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:24,736
 dig in there with that.        

1128
01:22:24,804 --> 01:22:27,872
             You want           
             to keep your hand. 

1129
01:22:27,941 --> 01:22:30,208
             I might need you   
             to shoot a bandit  

1130
01:22:30,276 --> 01:22:32,177
             if one's after me. 

1131
01:22:32,245 --> 01:22:35,947
             Ow!                

1132
01:22:35,782 --> 01:22:39,684
             You best           
             cross the river    
             and make a camp.   

1133
01:22:39,752 --> 01:22:41,853
             Going to come      
             a storm tonight.   

1134
01:22:42,088 --> 01:22:43,355
             Be harder          
             to cross tomorrow. 

1135
01:22:43,423 --> 01:22:44,889
                Ow!             

1136
01:22:47,693 --> 01:22:49,227
 A storm, you say?              

1137
01:22:49,295 --> 01:22:50,429
                     Mm.        

1138
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,630
             The wind will hit  
             about sundown,     

1139
01:22:52,698 --> 01:22:54,566
            blowing sand,       
            and then lightning. 

1140
01:22:56,035 --> 01:22:57,869
            Don't tie your      
            horses to no trees. 

1141
01:22:57,937 --> 01:22:59,604
             Ooh!               

1142
01:23:04,177 --> 01:23:06,278
 Jake's going to want           
 to rest here a while.          

1143
01:23:06,346 --> 01:23:07,946
             He can rest        
             on the other side. 

1144
01:23:09,983 --> 01:23:11,683
            Get...              

1145
01:23:14,386 --> 01:23:15,920
 Dern little thorn.             

1146
01:23:16,989 --> 01:23:18,923
         Now you be             
         shuffling cards again. 

1147
01:23:29,902 --> 01:23:31,136
             All right, Miss.   

1148
01:23:31,204 --> 01:23:33,872
         Let's get you packed   
         and across the river.  

1149
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:36,241
             I got to get       
             back to that herd  

1150
01:23:36,309 --> 01:23:38,844
         before that storm      
         come here.             

1151
01:23:38,911 --> 01:23:40,478
 All right.                     

1152
01:23:49,355 --> 01:23:52,324
            You sorry you       
            on this trip, Miss? 

1153
01:23:52,392 --> 01:23:55,427
        It's going to be        
        a lot harder            
        than I thought.         

1154
01:23:55,928 --> 01:23:57,662
                 Well,          

1155
01:23:57,730 --> 01:23:59,998
             I believe          
             you up to it,      
             ain't you?         

1156
01:24:00,066 --> 01:24:03,035
     I'll have to be            
     to make San Francisco.     

1157
01:24:11,677 --> 01:24:14,146
     Well, Woodrow,             
     here's where we find out   

1158
01:24:14,213 --> 01:24:16,814
         if we was meant        
         to be cowboys.         

1159
01:24:16,882 --> 01:24:18,683
                     I reckon.  

1160
01:24:20,453 --> 01:24:22,220
         Don't look good.       

1161
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:42,274
     Hold them, boys!           
     Don't let them scatter!    

1162
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:44,109
 I don't like this,             
 Newt.                          

1163
01:24:44,177 --> 01:24:46,711
                 Come on, Sean. 
                 We got to turn 
                 the cattle.    

1164
01:24:58,991 --> 01:25:00,758
         Get over there!        

1165
01:25:27,786 --> 01:25:29,321
                Sean!           

1166
01:25:33,793 --> 01:25:35,894
                Sean!           

1167
01:25:35,961 --> 01:25:39,030
         Over here, Newt!       
         Over here!             

1168
01:25:41,901 --> 01:25:44,336
                 I fell         
                 off my horse.  
                Hurry.          

1169
01:25:51,210 --> 01:25:52,911
                    Look!       
                    What is it? 

1170
01:25:56,849 --> 01:25:59,250
     The herd's                 
     caught the lightning!      
     Ride off! Get!             

1171
01:26:22,808 --> 01:26:24,443
                 Jake, look!    

1172
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:26,211
     What?                      

1173
01:26:29,615 --> 01:26:32,050
 We got to get out              
 from under this tree.          

1174
01:26:32,117 --> 01:26:33,718
                         No!    

1175
01:26:33,786 --> 01:26:36,354
 Ain't no place                 
 to sit out a storm!            

1176
01:26:36,422 --> 01:26:38,589
     No! I'm staying here!      

1177
01:26:38,657 --> 01:26:40,958
             Don't worry about  
             your dern horse!   

1178
01:26:42,194 --> 01:26:44,396
         Lorie, no!             
         Come back here!        

1179
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:05,650
                 Heave!         

1180
01:27:09,389 --> 01:27:10,922
                Heave!          

1181
01:27:16,496 --> 01:27:17,662
             Heave!             

1182
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:23,067
             Heave!             

1183
01:27:26,472 --> 01:27:29,107
             It would be easier 
             if you got         
             down from there.   

1184
01:27:29,175 --> 01:27:31,109
                    Maybe he's  
                    stuck, too. 

1185
01:27:31,177 --> 01:27:33,411
         If I had my gun,       
         I'd unstick him.       

1186
01:27:34,914 --> 01:27:37,516
 Ain't you boys got             
 that wagon unstuck yet?        

1187
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:39,551
                     Not yet.   

1188
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:52,397
            We lose anybody?    

1189
01:27:52,465 --> 01:27:53,832
 Everybody's fine.              

1190
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,100
 Except I ain't seen            
 Mr. Gus nowhere.               

1191
01:27:56,168 --> 01:27:58,437
                I seen him ride 
                off yonderways  

1192
01:27:58,504 --> 01:28:00,305
             right after sunup. 

1193
01:28:00,372 --> 01:28:03,575
 Probably hunting for his jug.  
 How about the cattle?          

1194
01:28:03,642 --> 01:28:05,844
 I figure                       
 we lost 20, 25.                

1195
01:28:05,912 --> 01:28:08,479
         Could have been        
         much worse.            

1196
01:28:08,547 --> 01:28:10,148
         Ain't no point in      
         getting clean.         

1197
01:28:10,215 --> 01:28:13,084
         You'll cross           
         the Nueces River       
         before dark.           

1198
01:28:13,152 --> 01:28:15,554
                 That's fine    
                 with Lippy.    

1199
01:28:15,621 --> 01:28:17,589
                 Could use      
                 a good wash.   

1200
01:28:23,763 --> 01:28:27,031
             How many rivers    
             will there be?     

1201
01:28:27,099 --> 01:28:29,401
 Oh, I don't know.              

1202
01:28:29,468 --> 01:28:31,636
 There's a bunch,               
 I bet, though.                 

1203
01:28:33,539 --> 01:28:36,240
         Me, I be wishing       
         we'd go around them.   

1204
01:28:36,309 --> 01:28:39,544
 Yeah, that would               
 suit me all right, too.        

1205
01:28:39,612 --> 01:28:41,313
         I crossed an ocean.    

1206
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:43,881
         I don't know why       
         I'm afraid             
         of crossing a river.   

1207
01:28:47,386 --> 01:28:49,420
     (WHISTLING)                

1208
01:29:01,033 --> 01:29:03,635
                 Gus!           
 I found your horse.            

1209
01:29:05,237 --> 01:29:07,071
 He got away last night         
 in the storm.                  

1210
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:08,807
                     So I see.  

1211
01:29:08,874 --> 01:29:11,543
                 Here you go,   
                 darling. Whoa. 

1212
01:29:13,278 --> 01:29:16,280
         I don't see young Jake 
         around nowhere.        

1213
01:29:16,349 --> 01:29:18,216
                 He rode off    
                 a minute ago   

1214
01:29:18,283 --> 01:29:19,451
             to track my horse. 

1215
01:29:19,518 --> 01:29:21,419
 Track your horse?              

1216
01:29:21,487 --> 01:29:22,687
 He couldn't track              
 an elephant                    

1217
01:29:22,755 --> 01:29:24,456
 if he was                      
 onto its tail.                 

1218
01:29:26,859 --> 01:29:27,859
 I best call him back           

1219
01:29:27,926 --> 01:29:29,961
     before he gets             
     lost himself.              

1220
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,267
         What we got here?      

1221
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:38,403
        I'll bet you got coffee 
        boiling in there.       

1222
01:29:38,471 --> 01:29:39,337
     I do.                      

1223
01:29:40,372 --> 01:29:42,073
             I swear, Lorie,    

1224
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,275
         you're as pretty       
         as the morning.        

1225
01:29:44,343 --> 01:29:46,544
         I guess traveling      
         agrees with you.       

1226
01:29:46,612 --> 01:29:49,480
         You get any prettier,  
         and I may be           

1227
01:29:49,548 --> 01:29:51,716
        forced to cut the cards 
        with you again.         

1228
01:29:52,784 --> 01:29:54,586
 I'll shuffle next time.        

1229
01:29:54,653 --> 01:29:56,988
 I don't trust you.             

1230
01:29:57,055 --> 01:29:58,690
             Who invited you    
             to breakfast?      

1231
01:29:59,225 --> 01:30:01,259
            Uh-oh.              

1232
01:30:01,327 --> 01:30:03,328
     Jake, you never            
     was grateful for nothing.  

1233
01:30:03,395 --> 01:30:06,097
 I return a $50 horse,          

1234
01:30:06,165 --> 01:30:08,666
    and all you do              
    is gripe about              
    my company.                 

1235
01:30:08,734 --> 01:30:11,670
             There's too much   
             of your company.   

1236
01:30:11,737 --> 01:30:13,137
                        Jake.   

1237
01:30:13,205 --> 01:30:16,608
 I swear, Jake,                 
 are you jealous?               

1238
01:30:16,675 --> 01:30:18,410
         Sure, after            
         you tried poking       

1239
01:30:18,477 --> 01:30:20,779
         every woman            
         I ever looked at?      

1240
01:30:22,314 --> 01:30:24,015
 Well, much as I'd like         
 to stay and discuss            

1241
01:30:24,082 --> 01:30:25,750
 the loves I won,               

1242
01:30:25,818 --> 01:30:28,520
 I best be getting              
 back to the herd.              

1243
01:30:28,587 --> 01:30:30,087
 Thanks                         
 for the coffee, Lorie.         

1244
01:30:38,798 --> 01:30:41,265
         Try to keep            
         that mare hobbled      
         at night.              

1245
01:30:41,333 --> 01:30:44,335
         She was on her way     
         to Lonesome Dove.      

1246
01:30:44,403 --> 01:30:47,138
     I can hobble horses        
     without you telling me.    

1247
01:30:47,206 --> 01:30:48,974
            Well, that's good   
            to know, Jake.      

1248
01:31:04,323 --> 01:31:06,791
 Pack up. We're going           
 to San Antone for a while.     

1249
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:09,961
                San Antone?     

1250
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:12,731
 Good gambling town.            
 Won't hurt to                  
 stop a week.                   

1251
01:31:12,798 --> 01:31:14,065
 We'll catch up later.          

1252
01:31:14,133 --> 01:31:17,168
                 I ain't going  
                 to San Antone. 
                 I been there.  

1253
01:31:17,235 --> 01:31:19,404
 Don't buck me!                 

1254
01:31:19,471 --> 01:31:21,505
 I guess you'll go              
 where I say go.                

1255
01:31:23,108 --> 01:31:25,143
            Not to San Antonio, 
            I ain't.            

1256
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:29,681
     Dern it!                   

1257
01:31:33,686 --> 01:31:36,654
 I wanted to gamble             
 a little bit                   
 between here and Denver.       

1258
01:31:37,857 --> 01:31:40,458
         Go on and gamble       
         if you want to gamble. 

1259
01:31:40,526 --> 01:31:43,227
             I never said       
             you couldn't.      

1260
01:31:43,295 --> 01:31:44,595
             I just ain't       
             going along.       

1261
01:31:44,663 --> 01:31:45,964
             What?              

1262
01:31:46,032 --> 01:31:47,532
     Just leave you here?       

1263
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,166
             Sure. Why not?     

1264
01:31:49,234 --> 01:31:51,068
     Because Gus'll be here     
     every morning              

1265
01:31:51,136 --> 01:31:53,237
     wanting to teach           
     you card tricks.           

1266
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:56,106
         Well, that's true.     
         He might.              

1267
01:32:09,254 --> 01:32:11,188
         What was Jake up to?   

1268
01:32:11,256 --> 01:32:14,091
 Jake's just up                 
 to being Jake.                 

1269
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:16,360
 It's a full-time job.          

1270
01:32:16,428 --> 01:32:18,563
         It takes a woman       
         to help him, don't it? 

1271
01:32:19,798 --> 01:32:22,166
         I'll get some          
         of the boys downstream 

1272
01:32:22,233 --> 01:32:23,634
         to keep the cattle     
         from scattering.       

1273
01:32:23,702 --> 01:32:26,471
         Ease Old Dog in.       

1274
01:32:26,538 --> 01:32:29,306
        I believe               
        the cattle will follow. 

1275
01:32:29,374 --> 01:32:32,276
 Old Dog won't                  
 be trouble.                    
 He's like me.                  

1276
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:33,578
                 Lazy?          

1277
01:32:33,645 --> 01:32:35,179
 Mature.                        
 He don't get excited           

1278
01:32:35,247 --> 01:32:38,916
 about crossing rivers          
 no more than I do.             

1279
01:32:38,984 --> 01:32:40,651
         You don't get excited  
         about nothing          

1280
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,454
        except biscuits, maybe, 

1281
01:32:43,522 --> 01:32:44,756
         and whores.            

1282
01:32:44,823 --> 01:32:46,223
         Mm-hmm.                

1283
01:32:51,597 --> 01:32:53,598
            You was over        
            at their camp, huh? 

1284
01:32:53,665 --> 01:32:58,703
 Yeah, me and Miss Lorena       
 always take our                
 morning coffee together.       

1285
01:32:58,771 --> 01:33:00,972
             I hope the weather 
             didn't treat her   
             too bad.           

1286
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,141
 She's fine, just fine.         

1287
01:33:03,209 --> 01:33:06,677
             Good. That's good. 

1288
01:33:06,746 --> 01:33:11,116
 Yeah, we visited               
 the better part of an hour     
 about various things...        

1289
01:33:11,183 --> 01:33:13,284
    And people.                 
                     Yeah?      

1290
01:33:13,352 --> 01:33:14,719
 Though I can't recall          

1291
01:33:15,387 --> 01:33:17,055
 she ever did, uh,              

1292
01:33:17,123 --> 01:33:18,856
 mention you, Dish.             

1293
01:34:25,524 --> 01:34:27,758
 Look at them pigs swim.        

1294
01:34:30,128 --> 01:34:31,796
 Hey, must not be               
 too bad, huh, Sean?            

1295
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:34,265
    I'll go first,              
    all right?                  

1296
01:34:35,334 --> 01:34:36,835
                     All right. 

1297
01:34:38,704 --> 01:34:40,038
 Come on, Mouse.                

1298
01:34:48,314 --> 01:34:50,548
     That a boy, Mouse.         
     That a boy.                

1299
01:34:54,419 --> 01:34:57,188
             Hyah!              

1300
01:34:57,255 --> 01:35:01,225
 Come on over, Sean.            
 Try it. It's even fun.         

1301
01:35:05,231 --> 01:35:07,231
             Come on, boy.      

1302
01:35:27,586 --> 01:35:29,253
                         Aah!   

1303
01:35:29,321 --> 01:35:31,756
                         Aah!   

1304
01:35:33,926 --> 01:35:35,092
                         Aah!   

1305
01:35:36,161 --> 01:35:39,229
         Aah! Water moccasins!  

1306
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,000
             Aah!               

1307
01:35:45,604 --> 01:35:46,804
                 Aah!           

1308
01:35:48,507 --> 01:35:51,108
     Sean!                      

1309
01:35:51,709 --> 01:35:53,978
                     Aah!       

1310
01:38:48,819 --> 01:38:52,855
                     Aah! Aah!  

1311
01:38:55,258 --> 01:38:57,593
                         Help!  

1312
01:38:57,661 --> 01:38:59,863
     Water... Water moccasins!  

1313
01:39:02,667 --> 01:39:04,334
 Aagh!                          

1314
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:09,272
                 Aah!           

1315
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,175
 Sean!                          

1316
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:15,879
                     Aah!       

1317
01:39:20,451 --> 01:39:21,751
            Hyah!               

1318
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:27,189
                Ohh!            

1319
01:39:37,701 --> 01:39:39,235
             I'll get him out!  

1320
01:39:39,302 --> 01:39:40,670
             Aah!               

1321
01:39:40,738 --> 01:39:42,538
                         Aah!   

1322
01:39:42,606 --> 01:39:44,574
                     I got him! 
                     I got him! 

1323
01:39:45,942 --> 01:39:47,844
     Coming!                    

1324
01:39:47,911 --> 01:39:50,046
 Hyah!                          
 Go, go, go, go!                

1325
01:39:51,081 --> 01:39:53,115
             Ground his horse.  

1326
01:39:54,351 --> 01:39:56,152
                Snakes! Snakes! 

1327
01:39:56,987 --> 01:39:58,354
                        Newt!   

1328
01:39:59,523 --> 01:40:01,590
 Get back,                      
 get back.                      

1329
01:40:01,658 --> 01:40:04,093
 Watch them.                    
 Watch that horse.              

1330
01:40:04,928 --> 01:40:06,595
             Get a hand on him! 

1331
01:40:06,663 --> 01:40:08,064
 Pull him up here!              

1332
01:40:11,368 --> 01:40:13,103
 Unh!                           

1333
01:40:15,038 --> 01:40:16,272
                        Sean... 

1334
01:40:17,241 --> 01:40:18,241
             Sean!              

1335
01:40:18,308 --> 01:40:19,742
 Oh, oh!                        

1336
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,047
         Get out...             
                     Oh, Lord.  

1337
01:40:30,687 --> 01:40:33,089
         Ain't nothin' much     
         we can do, Newt.       

1338
01:40:33,157 --> 01:40:34,924
             He's been bit      
             too many times.    

1339
01:40:36,026 --> 01:40:37,260
                 No!            

1340
01:40:41,632 --> 01:40:43,099
    Pea, you snake bit?         

1341
01:40:43,167 --> 01:40:45,268
     I think I whupped 'em off. 

1342
01:40:45,336 --> 01:40:48,404
 Jasper,                        
 give him a good look.          

1343
01:40:51,242 --> 01:40:52,442
        He must've              
        struck a nest.          

1344
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:53,943
    I've crossed this river     
    a hundred times             

1345
01:40:54,011 --> 01:40:56,179
    and never seen more         
    than two snakes at once.    

1346
01:40:56,247 --> 01:40:58,947
                Storm stirred   
                them up.        

1347
01:40:59,015 --> 01:41:02,085
             All he wanted      
             was to return      
             to Ireland.        

1348
01:41:02,152 --> 01:41:04,487
 Yes, I expect he did.          

1349
01:41:04,555 --> 01:41:06,556
                    I don't see 
                    no bites.   

1350
01:41:13,297 --> 01:41:14,664
                 Sean.          

1351
01:41:16,867 --> 01:41:18,300
             Oh, Sean.          

1352
01:41:21,238 --> 01:41:23,339
             If I'd a'known     

1353
01:41:23,407 --> 01:41:26,509
        that storm was going    
        to stir them snakes up, 

1354
01:41:26,577 --> 01:41:28,911
        I'd a'picked            
        another place to cross. 

1355
01:41:28,979 --> 01:41:30,012
             Wasn't your fault, 
             Deets.             

1356
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:32,114
             Life is shorter    
             for some.          

1357
01:41:32,182 --> 01:41:34,984
 Sean was an unlucky            
 young sprout.                  

1358
01:41:35,052 --> 01:41:36,719
         It was nobody's fault. 
         Nobody's.              

1359
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:49,598
    Well, you boys best go find 
    his brother, I reckon.      

1360
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:21,364
 If you want to sing,           

1361
01:42:22,499 --> 01:42:23,899
 go on and do it.               

1362
01:42:29,673 --> 01:42:32,975
                 Sleep, O babe 

1363
01:42:33,043 --> 01:42:36,078
      For I'd rather be home   

1364
01:42:36,146 --> 01:42:38,314
                  Outside...  

1365
01:42:50,327 --> 01:42:51,594
             I'll say a word.   

1366
01:42:51,661 --> 01:42:53,095
             Just a word here.  

1367
01:42:57,467 --> 01:42:58,700
     This was a good, brave boy 

1368
01:42:58,768 --> 01:43:00,869
     with a fine tenor voice    
     we'll all miss.            

1369
01:43:00,804 --> 01:43:03,873
 There's accidents in life.     
 He met a bad one.              

1370
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:06,375
     We may do the same         
     if we ain't careful.       

1371
01:43:07,611 --> 01:43:08,912
 Dust to dust...                

1372

     He's right, boys.

 Best thing                     
 you can do with death          
 is ride off from it.           

1375
01:43:37,608 --> 01:43:40,042
             Sean was the babe  
             of our family.     

1376
01:43:41,378 --> 01:43:44,280
            I wish I could have 
            finished the song   
            for him.

             with me a while,   
             Newt.

1380
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,601
         Ol' Bol won't cross.

            to Sean here.       

1383
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:10,739

 Ain't telling you,

         with me.

 Call this fast traveling?

1470
01:49:38,601 --> 01:49:40,669
 and didn't do more             
 than walk.                     

1471
01:49:41,671 --> 01:49:43,739
 I can keep up with you,        
 I reckon,

     Yeah, I expect he would.

 Well, you might just as well   
 jump on up here then.          

1479
01:50:14,905 --> 01:50:16,005
             Which way?

01:50:19,676 --> 01:50:21,811
             His wife run off   
             from him.          

1482
01:50:21,878 --> 01:50:23,946
             That's why         
             I got to find him. 

1483
01:50:42,899 --> 01:50:45,501
 How many barrels               
 you got of those?              

1484
01:50:52,008 --> 01:50:53,842
 I'll get it.                   

1485
01:50:56,846 --> 01:50:58,547
             Easy does it, now. 

1486
01:51:17,467 --> 01:51:18,968
                 Whoa.          

1487
01:51:21,772 --> 01:51:23,806
         Took you a while,      
         didn't it?             

1488
01:51:23,874 --> 01:51:25,908
            I been waiting      
            long enough.        

1489
01:51:31,648 --> 01:51:33,248
                Buffalo tongue. 

1490
01:51:33,316 --> 01:51:35,550
 Ain't that something?          

1491
01:51:35,618 --> 01:51:37,653
 You got a buffalo tongue.      

1492
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:39,921
     You're the one             
     can eat it, too.           

1493
01:51:41,958 --> 01:51:43,558
                 Who is that?   

1494
01:51:43,626 --> 01:51:45,093
     Luke.                      

1495
01:51:45,161 --> 01:51:46,929
                 Luke?          
 Luke.                          

1496
01:51:49,866 --> 01:51:51,667
                 What are you   
                 doing here?    

1497
01:51:55,171 --> 01:51:56,939
         Me and Big Zwey        
         partnered up.          

1498
01:51:57,006 --> 01:51:58,507
                 Partnered up?  

1499
01:52:00,042 --> 01:52:02,778
                 We're going    
                 to Ogallala.   

1500
01:52:02,846 --> 01:52:04,946
         You ain't scared       
         of Indians, huh?       

1501
01:52:05,982 --> 01:52:08,617
            Well, I don't like  
            them much, I guess. 

1502
01:52:08,685 --> 01:52:10,920
    I already killed            
    five of them.               

1503
01:52:10,987 --> 01:52:13,856
 Won't bother me none           
 to kill some more.             

1504
01:52:13,924 --> 01:52:15,024
                        Well... 

1505
01:52:16,592 --> 01:52:19,528
         Might not hurt for you 
         to come along at that. 

1506
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:22,230
 You'll be glad of it           

1507
01:52:22,298 --> 01:52:24,066
 if the Indians                 
 get after you.                 

1508
01:52:28,038 --> 01:52:30,338
             Big Zwey told me   
             he was going       
             to marry you.      

1509
01:52:30,406 --> 01:52:31,707
             He did, huh?       

1510
01:52:33,476 --> 01:52:35,210
     He ain't as bad            
     as some.                   

1511
01:52:35,278 --> 01:52:36,545
            How would you know? 

1512
01:52:36,612 --> 01:52:38,781
         You ain't never        
         been married to him.   

1513
01:52:41,751 --> 01:52:44,286
     He ain't a man             
     to be put off.             

1514
01:52:44,353 --> 01:52:45,253
 You know it.                   

1515
01:52:45,321 --> 01:52:46,755
                 I'm married.   

1516
01:52:46,823 --> 01:52:49,691
         I doubt he knows       
         what the word means.   

1517
01:52:50,727 --> 01:52:52,694
 I know what it means.          

1518
01:53:21,925 --> 01:53:23,625
                 "Dear Ellie,

                 do you think?  

1532

 It's a long letter.            

1533
01:54:01,398 --> 01:54:04,466
        You want me to write    
        something on the bottom 
        of it for you?          

1534
01:54:04,534 --> 01:54:05,901
                     You sure?  

1535
01:54:06,736 --> 01:54:09,238
         Maybe put your name?   

1536
01:54:09,306 --> 01:54:12,440
 She'll like it all right       
 without nothing from me.       

1537
01:54:17,613 --> 01:54:20,515
            Well, we'll post it 
            when we get to      
            Fort Worth.         

1538
01:54:22,819 --> 01:54:24,586
 I know                         
 I'm slowing you down,          

1539
01:54:24,654 --> 01:54:27,156
 but I'm glad you               
 brought me on this trip.       

1540
01:54:27,223 --> 01:54:28,958
            Yeah. Me, too, Joe. 

1541
01:54:36,799 --> 01:54:40,001
 This town sure growed          
 since I was last here.         

1542
01:54:40,069 --> 01:54:42,271
             Darn people making 
             towns everywhere.  

1543
01:54:42,339 --> 01:54:43,839
         It's our fault, too.   

1544
01:54:44,907 --> 01:54:46,808
                 We chased out  
                 the Indians    

1545
01:54:46,876 --> 01:54:48,944
             and hung all       
             the good bandits.  

1546
01:54:49,011 --> 01:54:50,178
                Did it ever     
                occur to you    
                that everything 

1547
01:54:50,247 --> 01:54:52,281
         we done was a mistake? 

1548
01:54:54,951 --> 01:54:59,454
     We killed off the people   
     that made this country     
     interesting.               

1549
01:54:59,522 --> 01:55:02,791
 Nobody in their right mind     
 wants the Indians back,        

1550
01:55:02,859 --> 01:55:06,028
 nor the bandits.               

1551
01:55:06,095 --> 01:55:08,063
         If you like            
         civilization so much,  

1552
01:55:08,131 --> 01:55:10,431
            what are we doing   
            riding to the wilds 
            of Montana?         

1553
01:55:10,499 --> 01:55:13,135
 We ain't riding                
 to Montana now.                

1554
01:55:13,202 --> 01:55:16,038
 We're in San Antonio           
 looking for a cook.            

1555
01:55:41,231 --> 01:55:42,864
                  <i>Buenos dias.</i>  

1556
01:55:44,266 --> 01:55:45,333
     Howdy.                     

1557
01:55:48,438 --> 01:55:51,273
 We're taking                   
 cattle to Montana              
 and lost our cook.             

1558
01:55:52,708 --> 01:55:54,376
            Yes. I go with you. 

1559
01:55:54,443 --> 01:55:56,745
         My name is Po Campo.   

1560
01:55:56,813 --> 01:55:59,548
             Uh, can you cook?  
             Our boys is awful  
             particular.        

1561
01:56:03,586 --> 01:56:05,020
                     Try one    
                     of these.  

1562
01:56:05,088 --> 01:56:07,322
                 I fried them   
                 only this      
                 morning.       

1563
01:56:16,432 --> 01:56:18,366
 Dang. That's tasty.            

1564
01:56:18,434 --> 01:56:20,502
     Is it some kind of candy?  

1565
01:56:20,737 --> 01:56:22,404
                Grasshopper.    

1566
01:56:25,508 --> 01:56:26,641
         Grasshopper.           

1567
01:56:28,678 --> 01:56:30,745
         Kind of good, though,  
         ain't they?            

1568
01:56:34,517 --> 01:56:36,751
 Our boys ain't                 
 going to take much             
 to eating bugs.                

1569
01:56:36,819 --> 01:56:38,987
    I cook good beefsteak, too, 

1570
01:56:39,055 --> 01:56:40,789
         and bird egg pie.      

1571
01:56:40,856 --> 01:56:43,491
         Just one minute,       
         I'll be ready          
         to go with you.        

1572
01:56:45,528 --> 01:56:47,429
 Hang on there                  
 a minute.                      

1573
01:56:49,232 --> 01:56:51,433
 You ain't going to get off     
 down the trail a mile          

1574
01:56:51,501 --> 01:56:54,236
 missing your wife              
 like our last cook done?       

1575
01:56:54,303 --> 01:56:56,905
         My wife's in hell      
         where I sent her.      

1576
01:56:56,973 --> 01:56:58,240
     She made good biscuits,    

1577
01:56:58,307 --> 01:57:01,110
         but her behavior       
         was terrible.          

1578
01:57:01,177 --> 01:57:03,044
                 I think this   
                 is our man.    

1579
01:57:03,879 --> 01:57:05,647
 Well, we need a cook,          

1580
01:57:05,715 --> 01:57:07,249
         I reckon.              
         I'll buy you a horse.  

1581
01:57:07,317 --> 01:57:09,184
             No. I will walk.   

1582
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:13,188
         I do not ride animals. 

1583
01:57:13,256 --> 01:57:15,257
 What do you mean,              
 you don't ride animals?        

1584
01:57:15,324 --> 01:57:17,325
         It is not civilized.   

1585
01:57:17,393 --> 01:57:20,228
     Are we not animals, also?  

1586
01:57:20,296 --> 01:57:23,098
         How would you like it  
         if somebody rode you?  

1587
01:57:32,709 --> 01:57:36,612
         That's why I like him. 
         He's a philosopher.    

1588
01:57:36,679 --> 01:57:39,681
         Yeah. I hired him to   
         give you somebody      
         to talk to.            

1589
01:57:39,749 --> 01:57:43,118
            Free the rest of us 
            to get work done.   

1590
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:50,659
        We'd like a shot of     
        whiskey if it ain't     
        too much trouble.       

1591
01:57:53,963 --> 01:57:56,531
     Howdy, boys. You           
     got a good game            
     going there?               

1592
01:57:58,968 --> 01:58:00,668
 Who the hell                   
 is that?                       

1593
01:58:03,206 --> 01:58:06,508
 You got mud in your ears,      
 or what?                       

1594
01:58:06,576 --> 01:58:08,643
         Rye or what'll it be,  
         old-timer?             

1595
01:58:08,711 --> 01:58:11,879
     Well, rye will do,         
     provided it gets           
     here quick.                

1596
01:58:13,883 --> 01:58:16,084
         You durn cowboys       
         ought to broom         
         yourselves off         

1597
01:58:16,152 --> 01:58:18,053
     before you walk in here.   

1598
01:58:20,623 --> 01:58:23,825
    We got all the sand we need 
    without customers           
    bringing it in.             

1599
01:58:26,662 --> 01:58:28,230
         That'll be a dollar.   

1600
01:58:36,038 --> 01:58:37,839
                     Aah!       

1601
01:58:40,576 --> 01:58:44,513
 Now, besides the whiskey,      
 I think we'll require          
 a little respect.              

1602
01:58:44,580 --> 01:58:47,349
 Now, I'm Captain               
 Augustus McCrae.               

1603
01:58:47,416 --> 01:58:49,685
 This is captain                
 Woodrow F. Call.               

1604
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:53,689
 If you turn around,            

1605
01:58:53,756 --> 01:58:55,457
 you'll see how we looked       
 when we was younger.           

1606
01:58:55,525 --> 01:58:58,360
 The people here wanted         
 to make us senators.           

1607
01:58:58,427 --> 01:59:01,930
 Back then,                     
 we never tolerated             
 dawdling service.              

1608
01:59:01,998 --> 01:59:03,966
 As you can see,                
 we still don't                 

1609
01:59:04,601 --> 01:59:06,034
 tolerate it.                   

1610
01:59:19,482 --> 01:59:21,616
         Now, then...           

1611
01:59:21,683 --> 01:59:24,986
 If I could have                
 a fresh glass, please?         

1612
01:59:25,054 --> 01:59:28,657
            You broke my nose,  
            you old son of a... 

1613
01:59:42,305 --> 01:59:44,005
                     Well...    

1614
01:59:44,073 --> 01:59:46,575
             Here's to          
             the sunny slopes   

1615
01:59:46,643 --> 01:59:48,042
                 of long ago.   

1616
01:59:50,679 --> 01:59:52,680
 Whatever happened to           
 Wee Willie Montgomery?         

1617
01:59:52,748 --> 01:59:54,849
 You didn't have to             
 whack the bartender            

1618
01:59:54,917 --> 01:59:56,084
 when he owned                  
 that saloon.                   

1619
01:59:56,152 --> 01:59:59,954
         You're just mad 'cause 
         they didn't know you.  

1620
02:00:00,022 --> 02:00:02,524
     You're lucky they didn't   
     throw you in jail.         

1621
02:00:02,592 --> 02:00:04,159
 It ain't a crime,              

1622
02:00:04,227 --> 02:00:05,927
 whacking                       
 a surly bartender.             

1623
02:00:08,264 --> 02:00:10,565
 I guess they may have          
 forgot us, though.             

1624
02:00:10,633 --> 02:00:13,568
         Of course.             
         We haven't been here   
         in years.              

1625
02:00:13,636 --> 02:00:16,271
 They forgot us                 
 'cause we never                
 got killed.                    

1626
02:00:16,339 --> 02:00:19,441
            That's dang foolish 
            to say.             

1627
02:00:19,509 --> 02:00:22,310
 If a thousand Comanches        
 cornered us in a gully         
 somewhere                      

1628
02:00:22,378 --> 02:00:24,513
 and wiped us out               
 like the Sioux                 
 just done Custer,              

1629
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:26,414
 they'd remember us sure.       

1630
02:00:29,652 --> 02:00:32,587
         There never was        
         a thousand Comanches   
         in the whole world.    

1631
02:00:32,655 --> 02:00:35,390
 That ain't the point.          
                    What, then? 

1632
02:00:35,458 --> 02:00:37,325
 Another 20 years,              
 we'll be Indians.              

1633
02:00:37,393 --> 02:00:38,893
 They be sticking us            
 on reservations,               

1634
02:00:38,961 --> 02:00:40,828
 just to get us                 
 out of the way.                

1635
02:00:40,896 --> 02:00:43,664
             Ha! That's danged  
             unlikely.          

1636
02:00:43,732 --> 02:00:45,433
     Well, maybe                
     you're right.              

1637
02:00:46,135 --> 02:00:48,336
                 I reckon I am. 

1638
02:00:48,404 --> 02:00:51,639
 Yeah, well,                    
 I doubt we'll last             
 another 20 years.              

1639
02:00:55,144 --> 02:00:56,344
                     Gus!       

1640
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:06,488
     Now, where in the hell     
     is he going?               

1641
02:01:32,815 --> 02:01:34,148
 Gus...                         

1642
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:53,634
             What in the hell's 
             come over you,     
             Augustus?          

1643
02:01:55,337 --> 02:01:57,738
 I doubt                        
 you'd understand.              

1644
02:01:59,074 --> 02:02:00,442
         I doubt it, too.       

1645
02:02:04,246 --> 02:02:06,214
 When was you                   
 the happiest, Call?            

1646
02:02:08,850 --> 02:02:10,485
     The happiest about what?   

1647
02:02:10,553 --> 02:02:12,854
            About being         
            a live human being, 

1648
02:02:14,123 --> 02:02:15,724
         free on the earth?     

1649
02:02:15,792 --> 02:02:18,560
                 I don't know.  

1650
02:02:18,628 --> 02:02:21,396
         It would be hard       
         to single out any      
         one particular time.   

1651
02:02:22,298 --> 02:02:23,865
 Well, it ain't for me.         

1652
02:02:23,932 --> 02:02:25,767
 I was the happiest             

1653
02:02:25,834 --> 02:02:27,869
 right here                     
 by this little creek.          

1654
02:02:31,673 --> 02:02:34,509
             Me and Clara       
             discovered it      

1655
02:02:34,577 --> 02:02:38,379
         one day when we was    
         out for a buggy ride.  

1656
02:02:38,447 --> 02:02:41,616
             I might had knowed 
             it had something   
             to do with Clara.  

1657
02:02:41,683 --> 02:02:43,718
         That was               
         a long time ago now.   

1658
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:52,594
 Ah...                          
 God, she was beautiful.        

1659
02:02:56,899 --> 02:02:59,300
 I expect it was                
 the mistake of my life...      

1660
02:03:01,637 --> 02:03:03,705
 Letting her slip away          
 like I did.                    

1661
02:03:06,342 --> 02:03:08,543
                     Well...    

1662
02:03:08,611 --> 02:03:10,879
             You've always      
             got your whores.   

1663
02:03:10,947 --> 02:03:12,547
 Yeah, I guess I do.            

1664
02:03:16,318 --> 02:03:18,954
 I don't know why               
 you're down on whores.         

1665
02:03:19,021 --> 02:03:20,755
 You've had yours,              
 as I recall.                   

1666
02:03:20,823 --> 02:03:23,258
     The worst mistake          
     I ever made.               

1667
02:03:23,325 --> 02:03:26,928
 It ain't a mistake             
 to be human                    
 once in your life.             

1668
02:03:26,996 --> 02:03:31,265
 Maggie left you a fine son     
 before she died.               

1669
02:03:31,333 --> 02:03:33,334
 You don't know that.           
 He could be yours,             

1670
02:03:33,402 --> 02:03:35,370
     Jake's, or some            
     damn gambler's.            

1671
02:03:35,437 --> 02:03:36,905
         But he ain't.          
         He's yours.            

1672
02:03:36,973 --> 02:03:38,940
 Anybody with eyes              
 can see.                       

1673
02:03:39,775 --> 02:03:41,643
 Besides, Maggie told me.       

1674
02:03:42,545 --> 02:03:43,745
 We were good friends.          

1675
02:03:43,813 --> 02:03:45,380
        Ha! I don't know        
        about friends.          

1676
02:03:45,447 --> 02:03:47,949
        I'm sure you was a good 
        customer, though.       

1677
02:03:48,017 --> 02:03:49,584
 The two can overlap.           

1678
02:03:49,652 --> 02:03:52,721
     You'd know about           
     overlapping with whores.   

1679
02:03:52,788 --> 02:03:54,856
 Know what                      
 hurt her most?                 

1680
02:03:54,924 --> 02:03:55,990
     You wouldn't call her      
     by name.                   

1681
02:03:56,058 --> 02:03:59,260
 You'd never call her Maggie.   

1682
02:03:59,328 --> 02:04:01,796
             So what if I had?  

1683
02:04:01,864 --> 02:04:03,465
 It would have                  
 made her happy.                

1684
02:04:04,166 --> 02:04:05,800
         What? She was a whore! 

1685
02:04:05,868 --> 02:04:07,369
     Whores got hearts,         
     Woodrow.                   

1686
02:04:07,436 --> 02:04:10,372
 Maggie's was the most          
 tender I ever saw.             

1687
02:04:10,439 --> 02:04:12,139
             Why didn't you     
             marry her, then?   

1688
02:04:12,207 --> 02:04:14,942
 She loved you.                 

1689
02:04:15,010 --> 02:04:18,079
    She sat in that saloon      
    watching the door           

1690
02:04:18,146 --> 02:04:20,081
         after you quit         
         coming around.         

1691
02:04:20,148 --> 02:04:21,849
         A man's got more to do 

1692
02:04:21,917 --> 02:04:23,585
         than sit in saloons    
         with whores.           

1693
02:04:23,652 --> 02:04:26,787
 Like what? Clean his gun?      

1694
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:29,757
             Maggie needed you. 
             You let her down.  

1695
02:04:29,825 --> 02:04:31,226
             You know it, too,  
             don't you?         

1696
02:04:31,293 --> 02:04:35,430
     I don't know anything      
     of the danged kind.        

1697
02:04:35,497 --> 02:04:39,033
         That's why you won't   
         claim that boy         
         as your own.           

1698
02:04:39,101 --> 02:04:41,236
        He's a reminder         
        you failed somebody.    

1699
02:04:41,303 --> 02:04:43,037
                 You'll never   
                 admit that.    

1700
02:04:45,107 --> 02:04:48,075
 Like I said,                   
 Maggie was just a whore.       

1701
02:04:48,143 --> 02:04:51,212
     'I God, Woodrow.           
     You finally called         
     her by name.               

1702
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:54,048
     That shows some            
     improvement now,           
     don't it?                  

1703
02:05:02,892 --> 02:05:05,827
             You want some      
             prairie chicken?   

1704
02:05:05,895 --> 02:05:07,462
     I ate enough.              

1705
02:05:08,830 --> 02:05:11,198
 I might catch you              
 a frog for supper.             

1706
02:05:13,101 --> 02:05:14,235
                    A frog?     

1707
02:05:16,037 --> 02:05:18,773
                 I ain't never  
                 et no frog.    

1708
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:21,409
 Their legs                     
 jump out of the pan            
 when you cook them.            

1709
02:05:21,477 --> 02:05:22,744
                     No!        

1710
02:05:23,545 --> 02:05:24,945
 Yes, they do!                  

1711
02:05:26,582 --> 02:05:28,949
 You got to catch them          
 and throw them                 
 back in the pan.               

1712
02:05:29,017 --> 02:05:31,452
                I don't believe 
                that!           

1713
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:35,189
            How can a dead frog 
            jump out of a pan?  

1714
02:05:39,227 --> 02:05:40,695
             What's the matter? 

1715
02:05:45,967 --> 02:05:47,168
                     Hey!       

1716
02:05:48,537 --> 02:05:49,937
            Where you going?    

1717
02:06:05,721 --> 02:06:07,055
                 Howdy.         

1718
02:06:08,223 --> 02:06:09,591
                     Howdy.     
     Howdy.                     

1719
02:06:09,658 --> 02:06:12,026
                Could we borrow 
                some tobacco    
                off of you?     

1720
02:06:13,395 --> 02:06:14,796
            I ain't got none.   

1721
02:06:14,864 --> 02:06:16,364
                Ain't got none? 

1722
02:06:16,431 --> 02:06:19,333
 I reckon you're lying.         

1723
02:06:19,401 --> 02:06:20,835
             Oh, no, I ain't,   
             neither.           

1724
02:06:20,903 --> 02:06:23,338
            Why travel with     
            nothing to smoke?   

1725
02:06:23,406 --> 02:06:25,273
            Because it never    
            agreed with me.     

1726
02:06:25,341 --> 02:06:26,774
                I quit.         

1727
02:06:26,842 --> 02:06:28,977
            Well, we might      
            have to smoke you.  

1728
02:06:30,279 --> 02:06:32,013
             What do you        
             think of that?     

1729
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:37,352
        My name's Roscoe Brown. 

1730
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:39,721
             I'm just going     
             down this road.    

1731
02:06:39,788 --> 02:06:41,188
        I ain't looking         
        for trouble.            

1732
02:06:41,256 --> 02:06:43,157
 Going down this road?          

1733
02:06:43,225 --> 02:06:44,225
             Yes, sir.          

1734
02:06:44,293 --> 02:06:46,527
            Let's shoot him     
            and take his horse. 

1735
02:06:46,595 --> 02:06:49,230
                Drop your gun.  
        Wait just a minute!     

1736
02:06:50,066 --> 02:06:51,466
             Yes, sir.          

1737
02:06:52,835 --> 02:06:55,103
            Clamber down off    
            that horse, mister. 

1738
02:06:55,171 --> 02:06:57,638
 I... I'm from Arkansas,        
 and...                         

1739
02:06:57,706 --> 02:06:59,374
             Yes, sir.          

1740
02:07:01,677 --> 02:07:03,811
         Strip off them duds.   
            What?               

1741
02:07:03,879 --> 02:07:05,613
             You come into      
             this world naked.  

1742
02:07:05,681 --> 02:07:07,648
         Go out the same way.   

1743
02:07:07,716 --> 02:07:09,651
                     Ha ha ha!  

1744
02:07:09,718 --> 02:07:11,786
     I got some money.          

1745
02:07:11,854 --> 02:07:14,789
 There's probably $30 here.     

1746
02:07:14,857 --> 02:07:18,292
            I'll pull this      
            trigger on you      
            for your sass.

1748
02:07:31,040 --> 02:07:33,174
                That's somebody 
                shooting.       

1749
02:07:35,477 --> 02:07:36,678
             Aah!               

1750
02:07:38,914 --> 02:07:41,783
         Why, it's just a damn  
         little old girl!       

1751
02:07:41,850 --> 02:07:44,118
                And she's       
                a rock chunker, 
                ain't she, Jim? 

1752
02:07:44,186 --> 02:07:46,888
 She's done                     
 all the rock chunking          
 she's going to do.             

1753
02:08:07,743 --> 02:08:11,112
     What are you going to do   
     with that stick, Mister?   

1754
02:08:18,154 --> 02:08:19,387
                 Jim!

02:08:19,455 --> 02:08:20,588

1759
02:08:28,063 --> 02:08:29,330
            No, she's too fast. 

1760
02:08:29,398 --> 02:08:31,132
             I've never seen

1763

        I'm going to            
        give her a bullet

02:08:40,041 --> 02:08:41,442

             tear his clothes   
             with my 10 gauge.  

1767
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:50,050
                 Put it down.

            what in God's name  
            you doing in Texas? 

1772

02:09:10,206 --> 02:09:13,241
 It's a lucky thing             
 I found you, too.              

1774
02:09:13,309 --> 02:09:15,176
         Who was that           
         chunking them rocks?

 Oh, that is Janey.             

1776
02:09:16,979 --> 02:09:19,480
 You can                        
 come on out now.               

1777
02:09:19,548 --> 02:09:21,182
     July's here.               

1778
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:23,384
 He's the man                   
 I've been looking for.         

1779
02:09:24,653 --> 02:09:26,754
         My God.                
         On a whiskey boat?     

1780
02:09:27,656 --> 02:09:28,890
                        Well... 

1781
02:09:30,059 --> 02:09:32,293
 That's what Peach thinks.      

1782
02:09:34,296 --> 02:09:36,864
             It just don't      
             make no sense for  

1783
02:09:36,932 --> 02:09:39,967
                    Ellie to go 
                    running off 
                    like that.  

1784
02:09:40,035 --> 02:09:43,871
             That don't make    
             no sense at all,   
             does it, Joe?      

1785
02:09:43,939 --> 02:09:45,873
         Mama always            
         been like that.        

1786
02:09:45,941 --> 02:09:48,910
    She never liked staying     
    in one place too long.      

1787
02:09:51,546 --> 02:09:54,448
             Any idea where she 
             might have gone?   

1788
02:09:54,516 --> 02:09:56,184
 Maybe to go find Dee.          

1789
02:09:57,652 --> 02:09:59,020
                     Dee?       

1790
02:10:00,422 --> 02:10:03,224
             You mean your pa,  
             Dee Boot?          

1791
02:10:05,927 --> 02:10:09,797
            But Ellie told me   
            he died of smallpox 
            over in Dodge.      

1792
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:12,800
                     Joe?       

1793
02:10:15,237 --> 02:10:19,073
            Joe, I don't reckon 
            she'd lie to me.    

1794
02:10:19,141 --> 02:10:21,242
     Dee never                  
     had no smallpox.           

1795
02:10:21,310 --> 02:10:22,377
 Mama just married you          

1796
02:10:22,444 --> 02:10:24,045
     when they run out          
     of money.                  

1797
02:10:25,948 --> 02:10:28,248
         They... They's         
         something else, July.  

1798
02:10:30,252 --> 02:10:32,320
             Ellie's going      
             to have a baby.    

1799
02:10:34,556 --> 02:10:37,225
         Peach seen her with    
         the morning sickness.  

1800
02:10:40,429 --> 02:10:41,696
                 A baby?        

1801
02:11:15,463 --> 02:11:18,866
             I'm sorry          
             to be bringing you 
             this news, July,   

1802
02:11:21,036 --> 02:11:22,703
            but I thought       
            you'd want to know. 

1803
02:11:26,408 --> 02:11:27,475
         Joe.                   

1804
02:11:27,543 --> 02:11:28,576
                     Yes, sir?  

1805
02:11:30,412 --> 02:11:33,047
 Where would she                
 go to find Dee?                

1806
02:11:33,115 --> 02:11:35,616
                 He was up      
                 to Ogallala    
                 last we heard. 

1807
02:11:36,518 --> 02:11:37,785
     Ogallala.                  

1808
02:11:48,163 --> 02:11:50,364
 We better go find her,         
 I guess.                       

1809
02:11:50,432 --> 02:11:52,399
             What about         
             Jake Spoon?        

1810
02:11:52,467 --> 02:11:54,535
 I can't worry                  
 about him no more.             

1811
02:11:56,972 --> 02:11:58,873
        Ellie might be          
        needing me.             

1812
02:12:03,778 --> 02:12:05,279
         Ogallala.              

1813
02:12:13,455 --> 02:12:14,688
                         Howdy. 

1814
02:12:16,191 --> 02:12:17,525
         I'm Joe.               

1815
02:12:18,460 --> 02:12:19,927
 That's Janey.                  

1816
02:12:19,995 --> 02:12:22,863
 She's shy,                     
 but it don't last long.        

1817
02:12:22,931 --> 02:12:25,066
     You ever ate a frog?       

1818
02:12:56,398 --> 02:12:57,598
             Looks like Jake.   

1819
02:12:59,868 --> 02:13:02,436
 No, it's just Lorie            
 resting by a tree.             

1820
02:13:02,504 --> 02:13:05,573
 I bet Jake's gone off          
 to gamble somewhere.           

1821
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:08,543
             Hell, all I see's  
             a puff of smoke.   

1822
02:13:08,610 --> 02:13:10,744
 I think I'll                   
 keep her company               

1823
02:13:10,812 --> 02:13:12,813
 until that scamp               
 gets back.                     

1824
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:16,850
                 We got cattle  
                 to look after. 

1825
02:13:16,918 --> 02:13:18,819
 Well,                          
 what's keeping you?            

1826
02:13:40,575 --> 02:13:41,742
         Hello, Gus.            

1827
02:13:41,810 --> 02:13:43,277
 Lorie, darling.                

1828
02:13:49,017 --> 02:13:51,819
 How long's                     
 Jake been gone?                

1829
02:13:51,886 --> 02:13:53,187
                     Two days.  

1830
02:13:55,090 --> 02:13:57,458
         He went up to Austin   
         to play some cards.    

1831
02:13:58,861 --> 02:14:00,395
                 He left mad.   

1832
02:14:00,462 --> 02:14:02,730
             He's been mad      
             the whole trip.    

1833
02:14:02,798 --> 02:14:04,332
 Well, he'll be back.           

1834
02:14:05,667 --> 02:14:08,936
                Yes,            
                I know he will. 

1835
02:14:09,004 --> 02:14:11,605
     He ain't going to take me  
     to California,             
     though, is he?             

1836
02:14:11,673 --> 02:14:13,207
             No.                

1837
02:14:13,275 --> 02:14:14,375
 Don't be                       
 too hard on him.               

1838
02:14:14,443 --> 02:14:16,444
 He got you                     
 out of Lonesome Dove.          

1839
02:14:18,213 --> 02:14:21,548
         I didn't get all down  
         in Lonesome Dove.      

1840
02:14:21,616 --> 02:14:24,685
 'Cause back there              
 you was never                  
 expecting nothing.             

1841
02:14:24,752 --> 02:14:26,553
 Then here comes Jake.          

1842
02:14:26,621 --> 02:14:28,789
 Get you                        
 all full of hope.              

1843
02:14:28,857 --> 02:14:30,124
 Trouble is,                    
 Jake ain't a man               

1844
02:14:30,192 --> 02:14:32,326
 to support                     
 nobody's hopes                 
 but his own.                   

1845
02:14:34,596 --> 02:14:37,064
                 What did you   
                 stop off for?  

1846
02:14:37,132 --> 02:14:38,799
 Well, it's                     
 such a nice day,               

1847
02:14:38,867 --> 02:14:42,169
 I thought                      
 I'd just ride over             

1848
02:14:42,237 --> 02:14:44,038
 and we'd cut cards             
 or something.                  

1849
02:14:46,141 --> 02:14:48,242
            What do I get       
            if I win this time? 

1850
02:14:49,978 --> 02:14:51,745
 Well, I'll be your whore.      

1851
02:14:51,813 --> 02:14:53,547
 You can have a poke            
 on the man.                    

1852
02:14:55,750 --> 02:14:58,052
         Why would I want one?  

1853
02:14:58,119 --> 02:15:00,555
 All right, then.               
 If you win,                    

1854
02:15:00,622 --> 02:15:03,857
 we'll pretend                  
 you're a fancy lady            
 in San Francisco.              

1855
02:15:03,925 --> 02:15:06,560
 I'll bring you                 
 a glass of buttermilk.         

1856
02:15:06,627 --> 02:15:10,030
             I don't even like  
             buttermilk, Gus.   

1857
02:15:10,098 --> 02:15:11,365
         Then what?             
         You name it.           

1858
02:15:15,170 --> 02:15:17,271
             I just want to go  
             to San Francisco.  

1859
02:15:18,206 --> 02:15:19,440
            That's what I want. 

1860
02:15:22,710 --> 02:15:25,279
 Lorie, listen to me now,       
 pretty little thing.           

1861
02:15:26,581 --> 02:15:29,783
 Life in San Francisco's        
 still just life.               

1862
02:15:29,851 --> 02:15:31,685
 If you want                    
 only one thing too much,       

1863
02:15:31,753 --> 02:15:33,754
 it's likely to turn out        
 disappointing.                 

1864
02:15:33,821 --> 02:15:35,956
 The only way to live           

1865
02:15:36,024 --> 02:15:39,560
 is to learn to like            
 all the little                 
 everyday things.               

1866
02:15:40,395 --> 02:15:42,463
             Yeah? Like what?   

1867
02:15:42,531 --> 02:15:44,765
 Like a sip                     
 of good whiskey                

1868
02:15:44,832 --> 02:15:46,367
 or a soft bed                  

1869
02:15:46,435 --> 02:15:48,702
 or a glass                     
 of buttermilk                  

1870
02:15:48,770 --> 02:15:50,337
 or say, uh...                  

1871
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:54,108
 A feisty gentleman             
 like myself.                   

1872
02:15:58,579 --> 02:16:00,214
 Now, you close                 
 your pretty little eyes.       

1873
02:16:00,282 --> 02:16:02,416
 Now, go on.                    

1874
02:16:02,483 --> 02:16:04,985
 Don't open them                
 till I count to 23.            

1875
02:16:05,053 --> 02:16:07,554
 Ok, now no cheating.           

1876
02:16:07,622 --> 02:16:10,157
 Your cheating days             
 is over, woman.                

1877
02:16:10,225 --> 02:16:11,691
     1...                       

1878
02:16:12,093 --> 02:16:13,460
        2...                    

1879
02:16:13,528 --> 02:16:14,728
        3...                    

1880
02:16:14,796 --> 02:16:15,963
            What are you doing? 
        4...                    

1881
02:16:16,031 --> 02:16:17,664
 Don't open your eyes.          
 5...                           

1882
02:16:18,567 --> 02:16:20,067
 6...                           

1883
02:16:20,135 --> 02:16:21,535
 7...                           

1884
02:16:21,603 --> 02:16:22,936
 8...                           

1885
02:16:23,438 --> 02:16:24,905
            9...                

1886
02:16:24,973 --> 02:16:26,407
            10...               

1887
02:16:26,475 --> 02:16:27,741
             11...              

1888
02:16:27,809 --> 02:16:29,042
             12...              

1889
02:16:29,111 --> 02:16:30,377
             13...              

1890
02:16:30,445 --> 02:16:31,845
 14...                          

1891
02:16:31,913 --> 02:16:33,180
 15...                          

1892
02:16:33,248 --> 02:16:34,515
 16...                          

1893
02:16:34,583 --> 02:16:36,049
     17...                      

1894
02:16:36,117 --> 02:16:37,685
 18, 19, 20, 21...              

1895
02:16:37,753 --> 02:16:39,287
 Better make it 27.             

1896
02:16:39,354 --> 02:16:40,388
     21...                      

1897
02:16:40,455 --> 02:16:41,622
     22...                      

1898
02:16:41,690 --> 02:16:42,723
     23...                      

1899
02:16:42,791 --> 02:16:44,091
     24...                      

1900
02:16:44,159 --> 02:16:46,126
 25... Don't cheat!             
 Don't open them.               

1901
02:16:46,194 --> 02:16:47,895
     26...                      

1902
02:16:47,962 --> 02:16:49,730
 Ok. 27.                        

1903
02:16:49,797 --> 02:16:51,932
                 Why, Gus!      

1904
02:16:53,668 --> 02:16:55,169
             Aren't you cold?   

1905
02:16:55,237 --> 02:16:56,737
         Let's have us a bath!  

1906
02:16:56,804 --> 02:16:58,005
         Come on, woman.        

1907
02:16:58,072 --> 02:17:00,807
         Hope you can swim.     
         I can't swim.          

1908
02:17:00,875 --> 02:17:03,144
         I can float            
         for about 30 seconds.  

1909
02:17:03,211 --> 02:17:04,845
             Oh, Lord!          

1910
02:17:05,947 --> 02:17:07,414
         Hold your damn nose!   

1911
02:17:07,482 --> 02:17:08,749
         Aah!                   

1912
02:17:10,885 --> 02:17:12,252
                     Oh, Lord!  

1913
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:14,921
            It ain't very deep, 
            is it?              

1914
02:17:14,990 --> 02:17:17,557
                 I can float    
                 good here.     

1915
02:17:20,228 --> 02:17:21,995
 Man, this water's              
 so cold.                       

1916
02:17:22,063 --> 02:17:24,264
 I believe it's                 
 shriveled my pod.              

1917
02:17:24,332 --> 02:17:27,234
            Well, it wasn't     
            getting no business 
            today, anyway.      

1918
02:17:27,302 --> 02:17:29,169
 Gus, you scamp!                

1919
02:17:34,442 --> 02:17:35,643
     Boy!                       

1920
02:17:39,047 --> 02:17:40,214
            Gus...              

1921
02:17:40,682 --> 02:17:41,782
    Yeah?                       

1922
02:17:41,849 --> 02:17:44,218
 I'd go with you                
 to California,                 

1923
02:17:44,286 --> 02:17:45,819
     if you was of a mind to.   

1924
02:17:45,887 --> 02:17:47,421
     You would,                 
     would you?                 

1925
02:17:49,558 --> 02:17:51,792
 Well, I'm complimented.        
 Mighty complimented.           

1926
02:17:51,859 --> 02:17:53,627
                 Let's go then, 
                 all right?     

1927
02:17:53,695 --> 02:17:55,429
             Jake can take      
             his own chances.   

1928
02:17:56,298 --> 02:17:57,731
 I can't, honey.                

1929
02:17:57,799 --> 02:17:59,900
 I'm bound for Ogallala.        

1930
02:17:59,967 --> 02:18:02,035
                 Ogallala?      
                 Where's that?  

1931
02:18:04,372 --> 02:18:06,240
 Somewheres                     
 up in Nebraska.                

1932
02:18:06,308 --> 02:18:08,342
                 What's there?  

1933
02:18:08,410 --> 02:18:11,211
         A woman named Clara.   

1934
02:18:11,279 --> 02:18:13,547
         She's the only reason  
         I ever come            
         on this trip.          

1935
02:18:13,615 --> 02:18:15,916
 You'd go that far              
 for a woman?                   

1936
02:18:15,984 --> 02:18:17,451
                 You bet.       

1937
02:18:17,519 --> 02:18:19,420
 I'm a woman,                   
 and I'm right here.            

1938
02:18:19,488 --> 02:18:21,589
 You can have                   
 your pokes.                    

1939
02:18:23,825 --> 02:18:25,292
                We both make it 
                to Denver,      

1940
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:27,961
             I'll buy you       
             a train ticket     
             to San Francisco.  

1941
02:18:28,029 --> 02:18:30,765
         Would you mind getting 
         my pistol for me?      

1942
02:18:30,832 --> 02:18:34,802
             I don't know       
             if that fella's    
             friendly or not.   

1943
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:36,236
                     Looks like 
                     an Indian. 

1944
02:18:36,304 --> 02:18:37,705
 How can you tell?              

1945
02:18:39,374 --> 02:18:41,274
                Indians got     
                their own way   
                of riding, see? 

1946
02:18:41,343 --> 02:18:43,243
                This one's a... 

1947
02:18:45,213 --> 02:18:48,549
            Setting on an       
            old Mexican saddle. 

1948
02:18:48,616 --> 02:18:50,083
        I reckon he stole it,   

1949
02:18:50,218 --> 02:18:52,285
     maybe even killed for it.  

1950
02:18:54,989 --> 02:18:57,825
                 Go on, go on.  
                 Go on. Go.     

1951
02:19:00,061 --> 02:19:02,262
            You want the rifle? 

1952
02:19:02,797 --> 02:19:05,131
                 No.            

1953
02:19:05,199 --> 02:19:08,268
 I shot many a sassy bandit     
 with just my pistol.           

1954
02:19:17,979 --> 02:19:20,681
 Go hide yourself               
 behind that scrub.             
 Go on.                         

1955
02:19:21,983 --> 02:19:24,118
 I'll be all right.             
 You go on now.                 

1956
02:19:32,660 --> 02:19:34,061
 Stay put.                      

1957
02:20:26,081 --> 02:20:27,581
                 Like to water. 

1958
02:20:27,649 --> 02:20:28,916
 Help yourself.                 

1959
02:20:36,124 --> 02:20:37,357
 Hope you like it cold.         

1960
02:20:37,425 --> 02:20:39,760
     I ain't got time           
     to warm it up.             

1961
02:20:40,528 --> 02:20:42,396
             I like it wet.     

1962
02:21:03,318 --> 02:21:04,918
            I know you, McCrae. 

1963
02:21:05,653 --> 02:21:07,654
             From the old days. 

1964
02:21:07,722 --> 02:21:10,290
     I know you, too,           
     Blue Duck.                 

1965
02:21:10,358 --> 02:21:13,293
         Where's your friend,   
         Call?                  

1966
02:21:13,361 --> 02:21:15,462
        He ain't here           
        just now.               

1967
02:21:18,466 --> 02:21:20,501
             It's my bad luck   
             he's gone.         

1968
02:21:21,636 --> 02:21:23,837
             If I kill you,     

1969
02:21:23,905 --> 02:21:26,573
             then I will        
             have to wait here  
             to kill him, too.  

1970
02:21:26,641 --> 02:21:28,575
 He be back shortly.            

1971
02:21:28,643 --> 02:21:31,278
     You could sit              
     over in the shade          
     and wait,                  

1972
02:21:31,346 --> 02:21:34,080
 if you're able,                
 after you and me               
 get through.                   

1973
02:21:35,516 --> 02:21:38,953
            There's plenty      
            others need killing 
            besides you two.    

1974
02:21:39,020 --> 02:21:41,221
         I can't wait all day   
         to shoot two           

1975
02:21:41,289 --> 02:21:42,790
         wore-out old rangers   

1976
02:21:44,358 --> 02:21:47,294
            with holes          
            in their underwear. 

1977
02:21:47,361 --> 02:21:50,063
 That's a fine saddle           
 you took.                      

1978
02:21:50,131 --> 02:21:54,601
 With luck,                     
 it will last another           
 mile or two. Maybe.            

1979
02:21:54,669 --> 02:21:58,105
         You bring that tongue  
         north of the           
         Canadian river,        

1980
02:21:59,107 --> 02:22:00,574
                I'll cut it off 

1981
02:22:00,642 --> 02:22:02,643
             and feed it        
             to my wolf pups.   

1982
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:28,001
             He's a Comanchero  
             butcher            

1983
02:22:28,069 --> 02:22:30,437
             we should have     
             hung years ago,    
             but we couldn't,   

1984
02:22:30,505 --> 02:22:33,674
     because he was better      
     at riding long distances   
     without water.             

1985
02:22:35,810 --> 02:22:37,444
                 But...         

1986
02:22:37,512 --> 02:22:39,646
             He may be after    
             our horses though. 

1987
02:22:41,716 --> 02:22:43,750
             I better           
             go warn call.      

1988
02:22:43,818 --> 02:22:45,552
             Come on            
             with me, now.      

1989
02:22:45,620 --> 02:22:47,220
 No, I ain't going.             

1990
02:22:47,288 --> 02:22:49,790
 I don't like                   
 how them cowboys               
 look at me.                    

1991
02:22:49,858 --> 02:22:52,759
             You're sure hard   
             on the boys        
             that love you.     

1992
02:22:52,827 --> 02:22:55,996
             They've got        
             truer hearts       
             than Jake Spoon.   

1993
02:22:56,063 --> 02:23:00,433
     I left that behind         
     when I left Lonesome Dove. 

1994
02:23:00,502 --> 02:23:02,936
 Durn it, I don't like          
 leaving you here               

1995
02:23:03,004 --> 02:23:04,671
 with Blue Duck around.         

1996
02:23:04,739 --> 02:23:07,240
                 Jake will be   
                 back soon.     

1997
02:23:07,308 --> 02:23:09,476
 Oh, now                        
 it's Jake again?               

1998
02:23:09,277 --> 02:23:11,211
         You were the one       
         said something about   

1999
02:23:11,279 --> 02:23:13,713
         going to Ogallala      
         after some woman,      

2000
02:23:13,782 --> 02:23:16,483
             didn't you?        

2001
02:23:16,551 --> 02:23:19,252
 Still got enough light         
 to see where he went.          

2002
02:23:21,422 --> 02:23:23,156
 I'm going to send              
 somebody over here to          

2003
02:23:23,224 --> 02:23:25,826
 stay with you                  
 till Jake gets back.           

2004
02:23:25,894 --> 02:23:28,529
 The herd's                     
 only a mile away.              

2005
02:23:29,163 --> 02:23:30,164
             All right.         

2006
02:23:58,259 --> 02:23:59,893
             Newt.              
                     Yes, sir.  

2007
02:23:59,961 --> 02:24:01,762
         Ride over              
         to Jake's camp.        

2008
02:24:01,830 --> 02:24:04,198
     Keep an eye on Lorena      
     till Jake's back.          

2009
02:24:04,265 --> 02:24:05,999
                     Me?        

2010
02:24:06,067 --> 02:24:07,167
 Gus, what is it?               

2011
02:24:07,235 --> 02:24:09,569
         Blue duck's            
         in the area.           

2012
02:24:09,604 --> 02:24:10,604
                     Oh, Lord.  

2013
02:24:10,671 --> 02:24:12,672
 Sure it's Blue Duck?           

2014
02:24:12,740 --> 02:24:14,941
     I exchanged pleasantries   
     with him.                  

2015
02:24:15,009 --> 02:24:16,877
                 Go on, Newt.   
     Yes, sir.                  

2016
02:24:16,945 --> 02:24:18,445
     I'll take on               
     the chore.                 

2017
02:24:18,513 --> 02:24:20,346
             We need you here.  

2018
02:24:20,415 --> 02:24:22,783
                 You know       
                 where she is?  
         Yes, sir.              

2019
02:24:22,850 --> 02:24:24,585
 Why didn't you                 
 shoot Blue Duck?               

2020
02:24:24,652 --> 02:24:25,752
            Hell, he was ready. 

2021
02:24:28,322 --> 02:24:29,790
                Me and Deets    
                will track him. 

2022
02:24:29,857 --> 02:24:32,759
 He may be circling             
 to steal our horses.           

2023
02:24:32,827 --> 02:24:34,795
             You boys           
             best get back      
             with the herd.     

2024
02:24:34,862 --> 02:24:37,697
             Get your pistols.  

2025
02:24:37,765 --> 02:24:39,699
 Wouldn't                       
 surprise me none               
 to see Blue Duck               

2026
02:24:39,768 --> 02:24:43,136
 riding in with a gang.         

2027
02:24:43,204 --> 02:24:45,371
 I don't like                   
 the boy going                  
 to the whore.                  

2028
02:24:45,439 --> 02:24:48,842
         If I'd sent another    
         one of these rowdies,  
         Jake would shoot him.  

2029
02:24:50,511 --> 02:24:53,213
 She should have stayed         
 in Lonesome Dove anyhow.       

2030
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:55,949
        If you was a young gal, 

2031
02:24:56,017 --> 02:24:58,351
         would you want to stay 
         in Lonesome Dove?      

2032
02:24:58,419 --> 02:25:01,955
             Look how long      
             Maggie lasted.     

2033
02:25:02,023 --> 02:25:04,424
     She just happened to die   
     in Lonesome Dove.          

2034
02:25:04,459 --> 02:25:07,795
            You don't never get 
            the point, do you?  

2035
02:25:07,862 --> 02:25:10,864
             It ain't dying     
             I'm talking about. 
             It's living.       

2036
02:25:15,569 --> 02:25:17,971
             That's good,       
             Po Campo.          
             All right.         

2037
02:25:19,207 --> 02:25:21,207
             Let's go, Deets.   

2038
02:25:33,854 --> 02:25:35,355
                 Ok.            

2039
02:25:35,423 --> 02:25:37,558
         Let's see here, Newt.  

2040
02:25:38,126 --> 02:25:39,460
                 Um...          

2041
02:25:39,527 --> 02:25:41,328
         Howdy, Miss Lorena.    

2042
02:25:42,029 --> 02:25:43,597
         Miss Wood, howdy.      

2043
02:25:44,832 --> 02:25:47,167
                 Aw, Newt.      

2044
02:25:47,235 --> 02:25:50,637
         Uh, hello there,       
         Miss Wood.             
         I'm Newt.              

2045
02:25:50,705 --> 02:25:54,274
        Mr. Gus sent me         
        to keep an eye on you.  

2046
02:26:13,294 --> 02:26:15,929
 He didn't come out             
 anywhere on this side.         

2047
02:26:17,665 --> 02:26:19,666
                I don't find    
                no tracks here. 

2048
02:26:19,734 --> 02:26:21,969
             Must have stayed   
             in the creek.      

2049
02:26:22,036 --> 02:26:23,603
 He might have                  
 doubled back.                  

2050
02:39:01,261 --> 02:39:03,796
         Get out of range!      
         He'll kill us all!     

2051
02:39:33,126 --> 02:39:35,495
     That old man's             
     a tough one.               

2052
02:39:35,562 --> 02:39:38,498
         I'm going              
         to show him            
         something tough.       

2053
02:39:46,506 --> 02:39:47,807
         (GUNSHOT)              

2054
02:39:54,648 --> 02:39:56,883
                Hell, you ain't 
                hit him yet.    

2055
02:39:56,950 --> 02:39:58,618
     I'll get him.              

2056
02:40:00,487 --> 02:40:02,922
 He ain't got                   
 anywheres to go.               

2057
02:40:03,924 --> 02:40:05,357
        Has he?                 

2058
02:40:10,664 --> 02:40:12,131
     'I God, that's enough.     

2059
02:40:12,198 --> 02:40:13,633
         That is enough!        

2060
02:40:23,543 --> 02:40:24,744
     Look at that.              

2061
02:40:24,812 --> 02:40:26,979
 He's shooting at us now.       

2062
02:40:28,281 --> 02:40:29,949
            He can't hit nobody 
            from there.         

2063
02:40:30,017 --> 02:40:32,118
             He's just wasting  
             his bullets.       

2064
02:40:32,186 --> 02:40:35,054
 Maybe an old man like him      
 needs a better target.         

2065
02:40:41,461 --> 02:40:44,530
        (CLUCKING               
        LIKE A CHICKEN)         

2066
02:41:11,024 --> 02:41:12,959
        Here comes anoth...     

2067
02:41:16,429 --> 02:41:18,264
         Look what that         
         son of a bitch         

2068
02:41:18,332 --> 02:41:20,199
         done to me!            

2069
02:41:20,634 --> 02:41:21,968
            Monkey!             

2070
02:41:59,372 --> 02:42:01,808
     The Captain's worried      
     about Mr. Gus, ain't he?   

2071
02:42:06,713 --> 02:42:08,047
     Me, too.                   

2072
02:42:09,749 --> 02:42:12,718
 I get to expecting             
 to hear him talk...            

2073
02:42:14,121 --> 02:42:15,688
 But he ain't here.             

2074
02:42:15,755 --> 02:42:17,690
 My ears                        
 sorta get empty.               

2075
02:42:17,757 --> 02:42:19,558
            Mr. Gus will        
            be all right.       

2076
02:42:20,327 --> 02:42:22,261
         Maybe so.              

2077
02:42:22,195 --> 02:42:25,665
     But he will not catch      
     Blue Duck.                 

2078
02:42:25,732 --> 02:42:27,867
         Do you know him,       
         Po Campo?              

2079
02:42:27,934 --> 02:42:29,602
        Yes, I know him.        

2080
02:42:31,305 --> 02:42:33,706
        I once lived up         
        on the llano.           

2081
02:42:34,575 --> 02:42:36,809
 He killed my three sons.       

2082
02:42:38,478 --> 02:42:40,312
     After that,                
     I left the llano.          

2083
02:42:47,120 --> 02:42:48,520
 It's all Jake's fault.         

2084
02:42:49,622 --> 02:42:51,323
 He's a bastard                 
 for leaving her.               

2085
02:42:51,391 --> 02:42:52,825
 That's what started            
 all this.                      

2086
02:42:52,893 --> 02:42:55,995
         You sure are smitten,  
         ain't you, Dish?       

2087
02:42:57,263 --> 02:42:58,564
             Well,              

2088
02:42:58,631 --> 02:43:00,866
     I'll tell you this...      

2089
02:43:00,934 --> 02:43:04,303
 If she's alive                 
 and Gus brings her back,       

2090
02:43:05,739 --> 02:43:07,239
     I aim to marry her.        

2091
02:43:07,307 --> 02:43:08,640
                 Marry her?     

2092
02:43:09,676 --> 02:43:10,976
             Marry a whore?     

2093
02:43:11,211 --> 02:43:13,979
        Don't call her          
        a whore.                

2094
02:43:13,847 --> 02:43:15,748
         If you're so           
         in love with her,      

2095
02:43:15,815 --> 02:43:18,083
             why didn't you     
             follow her         

2096
02:43:18,151 --> 02:43:19,852
            and leave Gus here? 

2097
02:43:19,920 --> 02:43:22,855
             He's a damn sight  
             more entertaining  
             than you are.      

2098
02:43:24,891 --> 02:43:26,324
             So is that whore.  

2099
02:43:34,601 --> 02:43:35,935
         Get him, Dish.

02:43:38,205 --> 02:43:39,939
                 You boys       
                 want to fight? 

2101
02:43:42,075 --> 02:43:43,609
             Collect            
             your wages first.  

2102
02:43:45,411 --> 02:43:47,112
 We're done with it,            
 Captain.                       

2103
02:43:47,681 --> 02:43:48,948
            Jasper?             

2104
02:43:49,016 --> 02:43:50,349
 Yes, sir.                      

2105
02:43:50,417 --> 02:43:51,784
 I'm done with it, too.         

2106
02:43:58,858 --> 02:44:00,960
             Let's get back     
             to the herd.       

2107
02:44:01,028 --> 02:44:03,229
             Captain            
             don't take much    
             to sitting around. 

2108
02:44:16,577 --> 02:44:17,910
     Deets.                     

2109
02:44:20,146 --> 02:44:21,514
     This one                   
     I made for you.            

2110
02:44:24,117 --> 02:44:27,086
            Why, thank you, Po. 

2111
02:44:27,153 --> 02:44:29,021
         Is it                  
         of somebody special?   

2112
02:44:29,089 --> 02:44:31,824
 Like a little saint.           

2113
02:44:31,892 --> 02:44:33,225
         You know...            

2114
02:44:34,661 --> 02:44:37,263
     To help protect you        
     on our journey.            

2115
02:45:02,956 --> 02:45:06,625
     (GUNSHOTS                  
     AND INDIAN WAR CRIES)      

2116
02:45:37,223 --> 02:45:42,194
 I heard they won't             
 attack you at night.           

2117
02:45:42,262 --> 02:45:43,628
             They won't attack  
             at night?          

2118
02:45:43,696 --> 02:45:45,297
 That's what I heard.           

2119
02:45:45,365 --> 02:45:47,366
                 I sure hope    
                 you're right.  

2120
02:45:47,434 --> 02:45:49,468
            Ha ha ha.           

2121
02:45:50,103 --> 02:45:51,170
 Oh, boy.                       

2122
02:45:51,237 --> 02:45:53,905
 It's awful quiet               
 out here tonight.              

2123
02:45:53,974 --> 02:45:56,575
 We don't even know             
 how many there is.             

2124
02:45:56,642 --> 02:45:57,977
             I can go find out. 

2125
02:45:58,044 --> 02:46:01,580
         They'll make soup      
         out of you.            

2126
02:46:01,647 --> 02:46:05,050
 I'd like to know               
 what they was                  
 shooting at.                   

2127
02:46:05,118 --> 02:46:06,918
     They was shooting at me.   

2128
02:46:06,987 --> 02:46:08,854
                    Easy!       

2129
02:46:08,921 --> 02:46:11,056
            I'm Captain McCrae, 
            Texas Rangers.      

2130
02:46:11,124 --> 02:46:12,358
                I'm coming in.  

2131
02:46:14,027 --> 02:46:15,627
         Don't nobody shoot.    

2132
02:46:21,234 --> 02:46:22,634
                 Howdy.         

2133
02:46:34,881 --> 02:46:36,815
         Augustus McCrae.       

2134
02:46:36,883 --> 02:46:39,451
 July Johnson,                  
 and this is Roscoe.            

2135
02:46:39,519 --> 02:46:41,920
                 July Johnson?  

2136
02:46:41,988 --> 02:46:44,856
             'I God,            
             you're the sheriff 
             from over          

2137
02:46:44,924 --> 02:46:48,427
        Fort Smith, Arkansas,   
        looking for Jake Spoon, 
        ain't you?              

2138
02:46:48,495 --> 02:46:52,297
 Well, I have                   
 more urgent business           
 than Jake Spoon now.           

2139
02:46:52,365 --> 02:46:54,633
            I was about to say, 
            if you're looking   
            for Jake,           

2140
02:46:54,700 --> 02:46:57,069
            you missed him      
            by 300 miles or so. 

2141
02:46:57,137 --> 02:46:59,738
     The Indians                
     killed your horse?         

2142
02:46:59,805 --> 02:47:02,307
     I killed him myself        

2143
02:47:02,375 --> 02:47:05,544
            for a fort          
            when them Kiowas    
            got after me.       

2144
02:47:05,611 --> 02:47:08,013
             I appreciate your  
             running them off.  

2145
02:47:08,081 --> 02:47:09,481
             We were riding by. 

2146
02:47:09,549 --> 02:47:11,983
         They started shooting  
         at us. We shot back.   

2147
02:47:12,052 --> 02:47:13,718
     They're Blue Duck's boys.  

2148
02:47:13,786 --> 02:47:15,987
     I'm after him              
     and a woman he stole.      

2149
02:47:16,689 --> 02:47:18,323
     He stole a woman?          

2150
02:47:18,391 --> 02:47:19,458
             Yes, sir.          

2151
02:47:19,526 --> 02:47:21,460
     A girl traveling with us.  

2152
02:47:21,528 --> 02:47:22,661
        He probably camped      
        on the river            

2153
02:47:22,728 --> 02:47:26,331
         and sent them bucks    
         back to kill me.       

2154
02:47:26,399 --> 02:47:29,835
                 It's quite     
                 a ways north.  

2155
02:47:29,903 --> 02:47:33,706
 Well, our horses are           
 pretty near wore out,          

2156
02:47:33,773 --> 02:47:36,108
 but if morning                 
 is soon enough,                
 we'll                          

2157
02:47:36,175 --> 02:47:38,143
 help you                       
 track this outlaw.             

2158
02:47:53,926 --> 02:47:55,127
                 There.         
                 You see it?    

2159
02:47:55,195 --> 02:47:56,595
            I see it.           

2160
02:47:57,763 --> 02:47:59,031
                I'll be damned. 

2161
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:03,535
 The wrath of the Lord          
 is about to descend            

2162
02:48:03,602 --> 02:48:05,170
 come sundown.                  

2163
02:48:11,511 --> 02:48:13,879
 I best go with you.            

2164
02:48:13,946 --> 02:48:16,015
 You don't know                 
 how many there are.            

2165
02:48:16,082 --> 02:48:18,283
         Thanks. All I need's   
         the loan of a horse.   

2166
02:48:18,351 --> 02:48:21,420
            I'll have him back. 

2167
02:48:21,488 --> 02:48:24,289
 You mean to go                 
 at them by yourself?           

2168
02:48:25,558 --> 02:48:27,959
 There might be                 
 10 of them down there.         

2169
02:48:28,561 --> 02:48:30,295
 Maybe even more.               

2170
02:48:30,363 --> 02:48:31,497
                They scare easy 
                at night.       

2171
02:48:31,564 --> 02:48:33,565
             I just hope        
             Mr. Duck's there.  

2172
02:48:33,633 --> 02:48:36,368
                 I intend       
                 to kill him.   

2173
02:48:36,436 --> 02:48:39,138
         Look. I can be         
         of some help.          

2174
02:48:39,205 --> 02:48:41,106
                 Stay with      
                 your party,    
                 Mr. Johnson.   

2175
02:48:41,174 --> 02:48:43,542
             You've got         
             two young people   
             to look after.     

2176
02:48:43,609 --> 02:48:45,377
     Well, Roscoe can stay.     

2177
02:48:45,445 --> 02:48:46,945
             Well,              
             kind of chancey.   

2178
02:48:47,013 --> 02:48:49,181
                 You might      
                 stop a bullet  

2179
02:48:49,249 --> 02:48:53,185
        and never get to finish 
        that urgent business    
        you mentioned.          

2180
02:48:53,253 --> 02:48:55,120
     That urgent business       
     is my wife.                

2181
02:48:57,757 --> 02:49:00,325
         She left home.         

2182
02:49:00,393 --> 02:49:02,627
         Look, I know           
         it's unlikely,         

2183
02:49:02,695 --> 02:49:04,896
     but it might be that       
     she got stolen, too.       

2184
02:49:09,835 --> 02:49:11,236
         Well, I guess          
         you're no more         
         fool than me,          

2185
02:49:11,304 --> 02:49:15,140
        chasing a woman         
        across the plains.      

2186
02:49:15,208 --> 02:49:17,142
         I might have got one.  
         I don't know.          

2187
02:49:18,177 --> 02:49:19,244
 I doubt it.                    

2188
02:49:19,312 --> 02:49:21,546
             Uhh...             
             Ohh... I hurt bad. 

2189
02:49:21,614 --> 02:49:23,882
            Go ahead. Shoot me. 

2190
02:49:23,950 --> 02:49:26,285
     You won't catch me         
     wasting bullets.           

2191
02:49:26,352 --> 02:49:29,087
 Monkey can cut your damn       
 throat if he wants.            

2192
02:49:29,155 --> 02:49:31,223
                 He'll die      
                 soon enough.   

2193
02:49:31,291 --> 02:49:32,424
             Aah!               

2194
02:49:32,491 --> 02:49:36,228
             What did she do    
             to earn a kick?    

2195
02:49:36,296 --> 02:49:38,230
         You mind your own      
         damn business.         

2196
02:49:38,298 --> 02:49:39,465
     Aah!                       

2197
02:49:39,532 --> 02:49:40,966
     Aah!                       

2198
02:49:41,033 --> 02:49:42,300
             Ha ha ha!          

2199
02:49:42,369 --> 02:49:44,202
 You're not                     
 worth selling.                 

2200
02:49:44,270 --> 02:49:47,205
 The Kiowas                     
 can have you.                  

2201
02:49:47,273 --> 02:49:50,108
             How come you're    
             giving her to      
             the damn Kiowas?   

2202
02:49:50,176 --> 02:49:51,510
                Give her to me. 

2203
02:49:51,578 --> 02:49:52,678
         No.                    

2204
02:49:54,414 --> 02:49:56,081
             I want them        
             to carve her up.   

2205
02:49:56,149 --> 02:49:57,716
 Hell,                          
 I'll carve her up.             

2206
02:49:57,784 --> 02:50:00,152
     Maybe it will put          
     some spirit in them,       

2207
02:50:00,219 --> 02:50:01,987
        so they can             
        go out tomorrow         

2208
02:50:02,054 --> 02:50:04,256
 and run that old ranger        
 into the ground.               

2209
02:50:07,193 --> 02:50:08,560
     Give her to me.            

2210
02:50:08,628 --> 02:50:10,695
        Hell, I'm mean          
        as they are.

 You better be.

     If McCrae comes,           
     you better be quick.

2246
02:52:35,075 --> 02:52:38,343

                 Shoot me.

                of shooting.    

2255
02:53:09,475 --> 02:53:11,876

     when July gets back.       

2256
02:53:14,213 --> 02:53:15,680
     What?                      

2257
02:53:15,748 --> 02:53:17,649
             I heard            
             something          
             in that brush.     

2258

            Zwey, you take      
            Luke with you.      

2304
02:57:00,906 --> 02:57:02,206
            Luke.               

2305
02:57:34,807 --> 02:57:36,240
                 Howdy.         

2306
02:57:36,308 --> 02:57:37,909
 You went with Zwey.            

2307
02:57:37,977 --> 02:57:40,779
             I told him         
             we'd hunt better   
             separately.        

2308
02:57:40,846 --> 02:57:42,847
     Why ain't you              
     hunting then?              

2309
02:57:42,915 --> 02:57:44,316
             I am a-hunting.    

2310
02:57:44,383 --> 02:57:45,717
             Right here.        

2311
02:57:46,652 --> 02:57:48,220
 I'm having a baby.             

2312
02:57:48,287 --> 02:57:50,055
 I can't be doing that.         

2313
02:57:50,123 --> 02:57:51,256
             Not for a while.   

2314
02:57:51,323 --> 02:57:53,625
             You ain't having   
             no baby yet.       

2315
02:57:53,692 --> 02:57:55,227
                 I only         
                 want a little. 

2316
02:57:55,294 --> 02:57:57,763
 Won't take                     
 but six minutes.               

2317
02:57:57,830 --> 02:58:00,431
         If Zwey catches you,   
         he'll kill you.        

2318
02:58:00,499 --> 02:58:03,434
 Zwey, he ain't no smarter      
 than a buffalo.                

2319
02:58:03,502 --> 02:58:05,303
 I might shoot him.             

2320
02:58:06,605 --> 02:58:07,705
             Zwey!              

2321
02:58:08,407 --> 02:58:09,941
                 Get off me!    

2322
02:58:10,009 --> 02:58:11,910
 Hold still!                    

2323
02:58:20,452 --> 02:58:23,054
     Was he trying              
     to marry you?              

2324
02:58:23,122 --> 02:58:25,323
                 You could      
                 call it that.  

2325
02:58:25,391 --> 02:58:27,192
                 He was trying  
                 to do me.      

2326
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:29,795
             I want him         
             to let me alone.   

2327
02:58:29,862 --> 02:58:32,030
        How'd the hunting go?   
        You shoot a turkey?     

2328
02:58:32,098 --> 02:58:33,531
 I got one.                     

2329
02:58:35,101 --> 02:58:36,901
        Want me to pluck        
        them feathers?          

2330
02:58:36,969 --> 02:58:38,904
 No, I don't, Luke.             

2331
02:58:38,971 --> 02:58:40,404
     I want you just            
     to stay there.             

2332
02:58:41,340 --> 02:58:43,541
    I wish you wouldn't         
    be doing this.              

2333
02:58:45,311 --> 02:58:47,478
        I won't do it no more.  

2334
02:58:47,546 --> 02:58:50,114
     Next time                  
     you go hunting,            
     make sure he's with you.   

2335
02:58:50,182 --> 02:58:52,617
         He can't               
         pester me then.        

2336
02:58:52,685 --> 02:58:56,454
     No, I think                
     I better kill him.         

2337
02:58:57,089 --> 02:58:58,523
 No, Zwey.                      

2338
02:58:58,591 --> 02:59:00,191
 Don't! Don't!                  

2339
02:59:00,258 --> 02:59:02,226
 Zwey, that's enough.           
 You'll kill him.               

2340
02:59:02,294 --> 02:59:06,765
    Zwey, we might need him     
    if the Indians come! Don't! 

2341
02:59:09,068 --> 02:59:10,401
             Zwey!              

2342
02:59:14,707 --> 02:59:16,340
     He's alive.                

2343
02:59:16,408 --> 02:59:18,610
             He'll quit it now, 
             won't he?          

2344
02:59:18,677 --> 02:59:20,177
             Quit trying        
             to marry you.      

2345
02:59:26,752 --> 02:59:29,387
        Don't he look funny     
        with that ear           
        hanging off?            

2346
02:59:30,589 --> 02:59:33,024
        I'll go pluck           
        that bird, Luke.        

2347
02:59:33,091 --> 02:59:34,892
     Have us                    
     some supper to eat.        

2348
03:00:01,687 --> 03:00:04,722
         Hey! Don't be spitting 
         on my floor.           

2349
03:00:04,790 --> 03:00:06,657
 Roy spits                      
 where he pleases.              

2350
03:00:06,725 --> 03:00:08,994
                That's why      
                I mentioned it. 

2351
03:00:10,096 --> 03:00:12,364
                 Melba, do it   
                 in the alley   

2352
03:00:12,431 --> 03:00:15,233
    if you're giving it away.   
    Otherwise, get on upstairs. 

2353
03:00:16,435 --> 03:00:18,770
 You've been known              
 to give it away yourself.      

2354
03:00:18,837 --> 03:00:22,540
                And it's about  
                to break me,    
                Mr. Spoon.      

2355
03:00:27,346 --> 03:00:28,646
            $10.                

2356
03:00:30,682 --> 03:00:31,983
                 Spoon?         

2357
03:00:32,051 --> 03:00:34,185
            You Jake Spoon,     
            the Ranger?         

2358
03:00:42,261 --> 03:00:45,096
         I've done              
         some rangering.        

2359
03:00:45,164 --> 03:00:46,997
 He's Jake Spoon, the Ranger.   

2360
03:00:47,666 --> 03:00:49,367
    Never heard of him.         

2361
03:00:49,435 --> 03:00:51,303
 You rode with McCrae and Call. 

2362
03:00:51,370 --> 03:00:52,770
     Ain't that right?          

2363
03:00:53,639 --> 03:00:55,273
            Not anymore,        
            I don't.            

2364
03:00:55,341 --> 03:00:56,641
        McCrae and Call.        

2365
03:00:57,410 --> 03:00:58,810
         Never met them.        

2366
03:00:58,877 --> 03:01:00,812
        I hear                  
        they're tough men.      

2367
03:01:00,879 --> 03:01:04,182
         Let a half-breed steal 
         my whore, that tough.  

2368
03:01:04,250 --> 03:01:06,284
         You can't find her?    

2369
03:01:06,352 --> 03:01:08,553
         They lost her.         
         Let them find her.     

2370
03:01:08,621 --> 03:01:10,888
         We're going up         
         to Kansas.             

2371
03:01:10,956 --> 03:01:12,557
         Me and my brothers,    

2372
03:01:13,593 --> 03:01:15,093
         Frog Lip there.        

2373
03:01:19,231 --> 03:01:20,431
         Kansas, huh?           

2374
03:01:20,499 --> 03:01:22,968
        Going to rob            
        some banks.             

2375
03:01:23,035 --> 03:01:24,669
     Ain't that right, Dan?     

2376
03:01:24,736 --> 03:01:27,839
    Ain't got no objection      
    to robbing banks, have you? 

2377
03:01:31,377 --> 03:01:34,245
         It would depend        
         on the bank.           

2378
03:01:34,313 --> 03:01:37,215
     I wouldn't enjoy too much  
     law stacked against me.    

2379
03:01:37,883 --> 03:01:39,984
             Law?               

2380
03:01:40,051 --> 03:01:43,821
 Damn! I want my money          
 back. I wasn't through.        

2381
03:01:43,889 --> 03:01:45,724
             You can't squirt   
             in two minutes,    

2382
03:01:45,791 --> 03:01:47,525
             you need doctors,  
             not whores.        

2383
03:01:47,593 --> 03:01:50,595
 Look, I said                   
 I want my money back!          

2384
03:01:57,436 --> 03:01:59,571
            Made her mad,       
            by God, didn't he?  

2385
03:02:01,741 --> 03:02:03,308
     Well, let's go.            

2386
03:02:03,376 --> 03:02:06,077
 Some sheriff will be           
 poking around here soon.       

2387
03:02:09,815 --> 03:02:13,084
 Jake, help drag him out.       
 He's messing up my floor.      

2388
03:02:13,152 --> 03:02:14,886
     You coming, Spoon?         

2389
03:02:15,021 --> 03:02:16,320
                    Jake...     

2390
03:02:17,957 --> 03:02:19,690
             Let's go, boys.    

2391
03:02:20,826 --> 03:02:23,261
                     Jake...    

2392
03:02:23,329 --> 03:02:26,397
 Jake, you come back here,      
 you bastard!                   

2393
03:02:26,465 --> 03:02:30,168
     You ain't never getting me 
     for free again!            
     You understand that?       

2394
03:02:30,869 --> 03:02:32,136
             Jake!              

2395
03:02:50,856 --> 03:02:53,725
     That's Adobe Walls there.  

2396
03:02:53,793 --> 03:02:55,893
         Need to get us         
         out of this lightning. 

2397
03:02:55,961 --> 03:02:58,696
             Find us a nice     
             warm, dry spot.    

2398
03:03:14,980 --> 03:03:16,948
 That'll about do it.           

2399
03:03:20,052 --> 03:03:22,186
 It can rain                    
 all it wants to now.           

2400
03:03:22,254 --> 03:03:23,788
 We're nice and warm.           

2401
03:03:23,855 --> 03:03:25,323
    Real warm.                  

2402
03:03:26,926 --> 03:03:28,326
             Yeah.              

2403
03:03:33,598 --> 03:03:36,134
     This used to be            
     quite a lively place,      

2404
03:03:36,201 --> 03:03:38,136
         till the buffalo       

2405
03:03:38,203 --> 03:03:39,404
         run out                
         a couple years ago.    

2406
03:03:39,471 --> 03:03:41,105
         They ran north,        

2407
03:03:41,173 --> 03:03:42,640
     every darn one of them.    

2408
03:04:04,497 --> 03:04:06,164
         'I God, look           
         what I found here.     

2409
03:04:06,232 --> 03:04:07,365
             Gold coins.        

2410
03:04:09,001 --> 03:04:11,035
         There's 5s and 10s.    

2411
03:04:11,103 --> 03:04:14,472
         There's even a handful 
         of $50 gold pieces.    

2412
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:16,141
         That's good luck.      

2413
03:04:16,208 --> 03:04:19,177
     Now we can play ourselves  
     some high-stakes poker.    

2414
03:04:24,650 --> 03:04:27,485
                Now, all that   
                on your side    
                is yours,       

2415
03:04:27,553 --> 03:04:29,720
         and all this over here 
         is mine.               

2416
03:04:39,831 --> 03:04:40,865
                 There you go.  

2417
03:04:50,876 --> 03:04:52,877
             Put the cards      
             in your hand,      
             darlin'.           

2418
03:04:54,046 --> 03:04:55,513
                 Don't let me   
                 see them.      

2419
03:04:57,082 --> 03:04:59,116
            You remember        
            how to play,        
            do you, Lorie?      

2420
03:05:01,554 --> 03:05:02,753
                Good.           

2421
03:05:02,821 --> 03:05:04,455
         Now, your bet.         

2422
03:05:04,523 --> 03:05:06,224
                But be careful, 

2423
03:05:06,291 --> 03:05:09,160
         'cause I'm             
         mighty tricky.         
         Remember?              

2424
03:05:10,162 --> 03:05:11,729
         Tricky old Gus?        

2425
03:05:21,206 --> 03:05:22,740
         That's the idea but ,  

2426
03:05:22,807 --> 03:05:24,509
         we hadn't bet yet.     

2427
03:05:24,576 --> 03:05:26,344
        So we'll try it again.  

2428
03:05:28,380 --> 03:05:30,281
     They shouldn't have        
     took me, Gus.              

2429
03:05:36,821 --> 03:05:38,356
         I know, honey,         

2430
03:05:38,423 --> 03:05:39,723
            but they did.       

2431
03:05:44,129 --> 03:05:45,896
     They shouldn't have,       

2432
03:05:45,964 --> 03:05:47,398
         but they did.          

2433
03:05:47,466 --> 03:05:48,766
         They did.              

2434
03:05:48,833 --> 03:05:51,902
     Now, you just go on,       
     cry it out.                

2435
03:05:51,970 --> 03:05:55,439
     Yeah. You got              
     a long time to live,       

2436
03:05:55,507 --> 03:05:57,608
     and you don't want         
     this thing                 

2437
03:05:57,676 --> 03:05:59,644
        dragging you            
        backwards, see?         

2438
03:05:59,711 --> 03:06:02,946
     So you just cry it         
     on out to old Gus.         

2439
03:06:03,014 --> 03:06:04,982
     You'll be all right,       
     you hear?                  

2440
03:06:05,050 --> 03:06:06,684
        You're safe now.
