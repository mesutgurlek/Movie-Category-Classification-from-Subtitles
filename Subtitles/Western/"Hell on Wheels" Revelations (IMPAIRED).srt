Mmm. Well, this one here died

166
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:48,108
trying to draw down
on Cullen Bohannon.

167
00:12:48,233 --> 00:12:52,105
Well, then perhaps
he was stupid after all.

168
00:12:55,572 --> 00:12:57,573
Now...

169

This... hanging of yours
went not so well.

170
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:10,289
He was as good as dead
till Johnny Reb came busting in here.

00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:13,709
What do you propose to do about it?

This rebel... has upset
the balance once again.

175

about warfare as such.

Aah! Jesus!

Now, all of you that was
involved in this hanging

187

will accompany Mr. Toole
on his noble quest.

188

How the hell do you expect these
Bogtrotters to track down Bohannon?

189
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:23,673
Well, that's their problem.

You ain't that free.

What's it like to own
somebody, Mr. Cullen?

Any different than owning
a dog or a pig or a plow?

Well, one of them practically

Yeah, but...
You be owning her.

Even if she changed
your dirty drawers,

Yes, sir.
That might be nice.

Maybe I'd bring her in
from the fields

Would I own that, too?

Just maybe he different.

he would give me a penny

00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,594
Rumor has it you made
3 million off the deal.

491
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,515
5.

492
00:38:29,681 --> 00:38:32,900
I managed to buy the M&M
stock at quite a discount.

493
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:36,731
But don't tell a soul.

494
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:40,026
Thomas... please...

495
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,737
I have a family.

496
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,908
Don't worry, Jordan.

497
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,520
You're still of some use to me.

498
00:38:50,645 --> 00:38:52,080
Well, in the meantime,

499
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,832
here's a shiny new penny for you.

500
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,920
[Chuckles]

501
00:39:17,302 --> 00:39:20,014
Are you sure about this?

502
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:21,806
Yes.

503
00:39:23,151 --> 00:39:24,320
But what will you do?

504
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:26,114
Where will you live?

505
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,956
I haven't figured it out yet.

506
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:31,452
I do know that I cannot
go back to London.

507
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:36,207
I cannot go back to
a life I now despise.

508
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:40,920
Then it's decided.

509
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,508
I knew you would understand.

510
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,973
Lily, there's something
I must tell you.

511
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,309
Thomas.
No, no, I must say this.

512
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:59,886
I am a man, and what I
have with my wife is...

513
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:04,610
It is not...
What a man needs.

514
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:13,334
Ours was always a practical marriage.

515
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:15,246
I mean, there was a time when...

516
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:16,670
Mmm.

517
00:40:16,795 --> 00:40:19,130
But that time is past.

518
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:25,512
What I'm saying is if...

519
00:40:25,637 --> 00:40:29,177
If I had a woman like you by my side,

520
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,484
then... no.

521
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:35,489
If I had you by my side, Lily,

522
00:40:35,614 --> 00:40:37,592
there is nothing I...

523
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:41,296
We couldn't do together.

524
00:40:41,421 --> 00:40:45,301
This isn't fair on you.
I know. I know that.

525
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:47,487
Don't say anything.

526
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,372
If there is a chance...

527
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:55,379
If there is the glimmer
of the faintest chance,

528
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:59,173
then you will make me
a very happy man.

529
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:06,413
[Train whistle blowing]

530
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,927
What about Toole?

531
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,356
He out in them woods
with a bullet in him.

532
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,684
They all dead?

533
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,729
Yep.

534
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:28,513
Found this in one of his saddlebags.

535
00:41:28,638 --> 00:41:31,140
Ahem. You reckon I
should say something?

536
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:35,119
Suit yourself.

537
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:38,313
I don't really know my Bible verses.

538
00:41:39,982 --> 00:41:42,317
23rd psalm.

539
00:41:51,493 --> 00:41:53,537
"The Lord is my Shepherd.

540
00:41:53,662 --> 00:41:56,039
"I shall not want.

541
00:41:56,164 --> 00:41:59,267
"He maketh me to lie down
in the green pastures.

542
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,547
"He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

543
00:42:02,672 --> 00:42:04,783
Both:
"He restoreth my soul.

544
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:10,890
"He leadeth me in paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

545
00:42:11,015 --> 00:42:13,990
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

546
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:17,728
"I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

547
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:20,621
"Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

548
00:42:20,787 --> 00:42:24,267
"Surely, goodness
and mercy shall follow me

549
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:26,569
"all the days of my life,

550
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:30,797
and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord forever."
