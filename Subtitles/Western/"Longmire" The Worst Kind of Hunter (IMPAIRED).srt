00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,517
...Eco-maniac, Pete Brooks?
- Pete's not around. I need you.

156
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,893
- Gentlemen, how is everything?
- Great.

157
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,121
Just let me know
if I can get you anything. Coffee?

158
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,492
- A conscience?
- Henry.

159
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:37,466
- Walt, hunting this bear?
- I'm just trying to locate the bear.

160
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,629
We haven't even talked price yet.
Where'd the attack happen?

161
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,273
Seven miles northwest of town.

162
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,909
Right where it should be.
Why punish this bear?

163
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,102
That's like punishing
the wind for blowing.

164
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,976
- And if the wind killed a man?
- I got no other option, Henry.

165
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,279
Yes, you do.

166
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:02,085
- Can you pay me?
- No.

167
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:06,288
Well, I'll make you a deal.
I'll help you track this bear...

168
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,956
...but you gotta lend me
one of your deputies.

169
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,935
- Let me guess. It's not Ferg.
- Nope.

170
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,630
I want that feisty Italian.

171
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,140
Be careful what you wish for.

172
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,019
Well, what a surprise.

173
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:32,324
Pam! Guess who's here.

174
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,051
- You got a minute to talk?
- Sure.

175
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,390
I'm assuming this is about Ed.
What'd he do?

176
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,296
He got mauled to death by a bear.

177
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,829
I can't believe it.

178
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,838
- A bear?
- Your brother gave this as his address.

179
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,569
- Was he staying with you?
- Yeah.

180
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,576
He really didn't have no other options.

181
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,408
He was only supposed to stay a week.

182
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,083
Two weeks later, no job, no apartment.

183
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,345
- You didn't want Ed staying here?
- Guy is a criminal.

184
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,855
Best thing that ever happened to Pam
and her folks was Ed going to prison.

185
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:12,695
So either of you have any idea
what Ed was doing in the woods?

186
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,257
I don't know.

187
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,392
He wasn't too interested
in hiking or the outdoors.

188
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,165
Last I saw of him
he was going on a job interview.

189
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,706
Said he got a lead
from one of his prison buddies.

190
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,701
This prison buddy,
Ed give you a name?

191
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,710
I didn't ask for one.

192
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,645
To be honest, I thought
the whole job thing was bullshit.

193
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,114
I figured he was getting high
or something.

194
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,255
- Was Ed using drugs?
- No.

195
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,481
He was scary when he was using.

196
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,218
I didn't see none of that
when he was here.

197
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,725
RUSSELL:
Damn it!

198
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,024
I let him borrow my old Tacoma
for that job interview.

199
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,134
- Did you find it?
- I'm sorry, no.

200
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,293
If you give me a description of it...

201
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:56,965
...we'll do our best to find it for you.
- Even dead he's a pain in my ass.

202
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,736
I'll get you a copy of my registration.

203
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:05,282
Sorry about Russell.
He's been pretty upset lately.

204
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,079
They cut his hours way back.

205
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:13,089
Plus, he didn't know the good Ed
from before.

206
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:17,821
He was such a sweet little kid.

207
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,265
I can't believe he's gone.

208
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,905
I understand.

209
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,234
Now, apart from the buddy from prison...

210
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,276
...Ed hook up with any old friends
that you know of?

211
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,413
All his old friends are dead or in jail.

212
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,414
- What about enemies?
RUSSELL: Enemies?

213
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,211
Ed?

214
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,251
What about the parents of that girl
he killed?

215
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,475
- Hey, Walt.
- Ruby.

216
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,206
Oh, Branch left this for you.

217
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,850
Records on Ed Crawley's murder trial.

218
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,852
He also had me call down to the state
penitentiary to have the warden...

219
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,514
...send over a list of all the men
he's been locked up with.

220
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,354
- Thank you, Ruby.
- Mm-hm.

221
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,895
When you talk to Branch next,
could you let him know...

222
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,226
...I need a little background
on Russell Gray.

223
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,960
- Crawley's brother-in-law.
- Russell Gray.

224
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,533
WALT:
Ferg, what are you doing?

225
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,540
Sheriff Connally wanted to help out
with the investigation.

226
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,042
He's no longer the sheriff.
He's under arrest...

227
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,237
...pending assault charges
from the home.

228
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,507
Our investigation isn't his business.

229
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,548
You see the mark on that boy's ankles?

230
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,516
- He was restrained.
- I saw it, Lucien.

231
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,915
LUCIEN:
He was a druggie too!

232
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,647
WALT:
We did find some crystal meth...

233
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,190
...and possible
injection marks on Crawley's legs.

234
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,191
But we won't know until the autopsy...

235
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,523
...and get a tox screen.
- Who you looking at?

236
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,164
- Everybody.
- Oh, come on, Walt.

237
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,233
Ferg. Victim was last seen
in his brother-in-law's Tacoma.

238
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,699
Here's the registration.
I want you to find it.

239
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,805
- On it.
- What about my no-good nephew?

240
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,440
Why ain't he helping here?

241
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,839
I am helping. I'm bringing our
pain-in-the-ass prisoner his tacos.

242
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,948
Ruby, I need you to find me an address.
Donna and Ira Craig.

243
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,744
- Who's Donna and Ira Craig?
- None of your business.

244
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,682
Hey, Walt.

245
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,115
BRANCH:
You owe me 6.95 plus tip.

246
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,768
Victim was found down that path,
about a mile or so.

247
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:45,969
You make a habit of leering
at married women so blatantly?

248
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,603
Well, first of all, yes.

249
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,541
And secondly,
I had no idea you were married.

250
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,483
You don't seem domesticated.

251
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,147
You really think you wanna talk to me
like that when I'm holding this?

252
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,728
I just don't know
why you don't wear a ring.

253
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,923
- At least Waffles wears a collar.
- Who's Waffles?

254
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,762
The killer bear. Name's Waffles.

255
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:15,566
And they put a tracking collar on her
a year ago so they could study her.

256
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,067
I tracked her online.

257
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:21,804
It's pretty handy,
but it sure takes the fun out of hunting.

258
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,575
We're supposed to be trapping the bear,
not hunting it.

259
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,274
OMAR:
Well, that's the idea.

260
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,511
But we gotta be ready
for the possibility...

261
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,587
...Waffles won't go along with our plan.

262
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:36,160
But don't worry, Vicky.
Omar'll protect you.

263
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:39,921
Why are you telling us this?

264
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,662
- Are we supposed to feel bad?
- No.

265
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,861
No, it seemed like something
you might like to know.

266
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,438
You have any children, Sheriff Longmire?

267
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:53,108
- Yes, I do. I have a daughter.
- Oh, well, this is our daughter.

268
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,302
- Honey...
- Blair.

269
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,710
She should be 37 years old right now.

270
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,849
IRA:
An artist's projection of how she'd look.

271
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,953
We have one painted every year
on her birthday.

272
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,621
That's all we have left of her.

273
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,787
After Ed Crawley stabbed her 12 times.

274
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,189
His lawyers said
he wasn't in his right mind...

275
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,621
...because of the drugs.

276
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:15,062
But a human being does not stab
a 17-year-old girl 12 times.

277
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,828
Drugs or no drugs.
No, Ed Crawley was a monster.

278
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,994
- Honey, let it go.
- If it were up to me...

279
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,732
...he would have been swinging
from a rope years ago.

280
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,377
What is the point of capital punishment
if we can't use it?

281
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,513
IRA:
You've gotta understand.

282
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:33,082
The last 20 years, we've been
working to keep Blair's killer in prison.

283
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,380
We write letters,
we show up at his parole hearings.

284
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,353
If you don't mind,
when did you last see the victim?

285
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,825
Victim? Now he's the victim?

286
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,527
IRA:
We were at his last parole hearing.

287
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:50,156
- You have any contact with him?
- Yes, sheriff. We yelled. We cursed.

288
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,895
Made our feelings known.
And still, they released him.

289
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:57,065
It took a bear to do what the so-called
justice system should've done.

290
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,437
The hearing was a sham.

291
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,511
The new warden didn't know the case.

292
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,274
If the old warden, Dan Blackburn,
had been there...

293
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:08,112
...he would have convinced that board
to keep that animal in prison.

294
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,414
What's gonna happen with the bear?

295
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,288
Depends. Could be relocated.
Could be put down.

296
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,555
It ought to get a medal.

297
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,307
- Ruby, this is Unit Four. Over.
- Hello, Ferg.

298
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:35,242
Ruby, I canvassed the local taverns.
That's a negative on the victim's car.

299
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,208
Okay.

300
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:40,909
Frequently that's where
these ex-cons hang.

301
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,919
That's what they said at the seminar
Walt sent me to.

302
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,351
Mm-hm.

303
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,959
- Okay, then. Ferg out.
- Alrighty, Ferg.

you were crashing in?

456
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,323
- Patches.
- What's Patches' real name?

457
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,556
I don't know.

458
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,997
He's just always
got nicotine patches on.

459
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:00,262
Maybe Dave or Dan?

460
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:04,602
Can you give me a list of all the people
who live or hang out at Patches' house?

461
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:05,902
Sure.

462
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:09,046
Patches turns out to be a guy
named Greg Pierson.

463
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,774
He leases the house from
a woman named Amy Stonesifer.

464
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,247
LUCIEN:
I know Amy Stonesifer.

465
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,210
She lives at the home I was kicked out of.
Nutty as a drunk monkey.

466
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:20,721
Pretty smart when drug cookers
use a senile old woman as a landlord.

467
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,293
Lucien, do you mind? We got work to do.

468
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,056
Oh, that's right, Walt.
Of course. I forgot.

469
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,030
You're trying to waste time and money
punishing somebody...

470
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,691
...who did society a favor.

471
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,428
Don't you got somewhere to be?

472
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,438
Well, the hippies are
in my guest room, there.

473
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,071
Branch, I've got two very
important jobs for you.

474
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,943
First, Tweaker Joe gave me a bunch...

475
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,778
...of names of guys
who hang out at the meth house.

476
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,283
Pervy Stu?

477
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,081
Check the list the warden gave us.

478
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,714
See if any recently-released prisoners
have nicknames that match these.

479
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,088
Maybe one of them
is connected to Ed Crawley.

480
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,422
And the second?

481
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,327
Get the retirement home
to drop the charges and take Lucien back.

482
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,674
Aah! Hey! Hey!

483
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,071
Hey!

484
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:17,169
- Argh! Sheriff!
WALT: Ferg, you all right?

485
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,407
Branch, help Ferg.

486
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,153
What's going on in there?

487
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:37,092
- Walt.
- We get this a lot.

488
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,634
He has the symptoms
of a methamphetamine overdose.

489
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,431
Thank you.

490
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,374
All those greeting cards
must be laced with meth.

491
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:49,377
There were at least a hundred.
That's a lot of product.

492
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:53,313
That's more than casual use.
They were distributing out of that house.

493
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:55,816
Why distribute in that form?
Why not sell rocks?

494
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,050
What's the best way to get stuff
in and out of prison?

495
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,793
- Mail. That's a clever system.
- Yeah.

496
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,621
Lace meth in the greeting cards.

497
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,828
Prisoners just chew it up and get high.

498
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,729
If the meth house we raided
provided it to the prison...

499
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,735
Someone in that house must have
a connection to the prison.

500
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:16,874
- And a connection to Ed Crawley.
VIC: Hey, guys, look...

501
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,874
- You should be in bed.
- No, seriously, you gotta see this.

502
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:23,912
BRANCH: What do they have you on?
- This is where the dart hit me.

503
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:30,318
This is from a syringe. The dart, syringe.

504
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,517
Ed Crawley's holes looked like this.

505
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,158
Not like this.

506
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:39,763
- Ed Crawley wasn't shooting up drugs.
- He was shot with a tranquilizer dart.

507
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,024
Restraints. Flank steak.

508
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,895
Animal tranquilizers.

509
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,094
Someone planned his murder very carefully.

510
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,607
Any of these prisoners strike you
as sophisticated enough to plan either...

511
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,443
...a meth-smuggling operation
or an elaborate murder?

512
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,678
This guy, Steven Kane.
He acted as his own lawyer.

513
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,450
- Did he win?
- No.

514
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,462
LUCIEN: You're going at this all wrong.
This murder was brutal.

515
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,724
Tie meat to a man,
have a bear have eat him.

516
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,528
That's torture. Torture is vengeance.

517
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:20,193
Vengeance is your motive.

518
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,266
Crawley's brother-in-law
doesn't have much of an alibi.

519
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,409
He's a licensed hunter, so is Ira Craig.

520
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,942
That dude's definitely
a candidate for vengeance.

521
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,209
Ferg.

522
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,583
Can you read this?

523
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,985
FERG:
"Stonesifer"?

524
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:40,386
A guard named Jerry Stonesifer signed
some of these release forms.

525
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,583
Same as the woman
who owns the meth house.

526
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,160
He was a prison guard.
He would've known Crawley.

527
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:47,593
Maybe Crawley's prison buddy
wasn't a prisoner.

528
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:48,823
WALT:
But a prison guard.

529
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,628
And then Crawley's car
ends up at the aunt's house.

530
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,067
That's about four too many
coincidences for me.

531
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:55,830
Let's bring him in.

532
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,237
Found him, Walt.
He was resisting arrest.

533
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,570
Didn't seem too interested in talking.

534
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,308
So, Mr. Stonesifer...

535
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,919
...you worked at the prison for eight years
before you departed in February.

536
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,090
Mr. Stonesifer...

537
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,855
...you know a man named Ed Crawley?
- Lawyer.

538
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,828
I'll take that as a maybe.

539
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,764
Did you call up
and offer him a job couple of days ago?

540
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,699
- Lawyer.
- Uh-huh.

541
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,532
You in possession of any kind
of animal tranquilizer?

542
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,799
Lawyer!

543
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:35,173
Are you using your aunt's house as a base
to smuggle meth into the state prison?

544
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,211
Lawyer!

545
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,287
You should really thank Branch.

546
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,218
He persuaded Snowcap Vista
to take you back.

547
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,550
Now, how did he do that?

548
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:51,161
Apparently, he found several code
violations he threatened to report...

549
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,956
...unless they let you back in.

550
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,199
Proof of my nephew's shady ethics...

551
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,857
...and the lengths my family'd go
to get rid of me.

552
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:01,904
- Heh. I think Branch kind of likes you.
- I don't trust Branch.

553
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:05,372
More important I don't trust his dad.
My brother's a son of a bitch.

554
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,568
He wants to see his boy
wearing your badge.

555
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,838
- Don't worry.
- You'd better be.

556
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,642
Got any secrets, best be ready
to read them in the paper.

557
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:16,344
I think most of my important secrets
are kept deep enough.

558
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,015
So, what'd you used to do
when a suspect wouldn't talk to you?

559
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:26,691
- Simple. I'd whup his ass till he did talk.
- Ha, ha.

560
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,424
Well, we can't do that these days.

561
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,230
Oh, listen to your whining.
It's just so sad.

562
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,499
I'd shoot a buck out of season
to have your problems.

563
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,836
What you gonna do about
a suspect don't talk?

564
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,535
You're gonna do some sheriffing.

565
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,704
You gotta dig around a few garbage cans,
arrest some drunks...

566
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:48,340
...do some of that fancy CSI stuff,
analyze some bear shit.

567
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,729
PETE: Are you here to arrest me?
- I haven't decided yet.

568
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,527
I'm pretty sure you didn't shoot
Vic by accident.

569
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,193
If you were out there trying
to tranquilize a bear...

570
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,770
...you'd use a bigger dosage.

571
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:12,239
But if you were there
trying to slow down Omar...

572
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,107
...and my deputy,
you'd a used a smaller dosage.

573
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,612
Make sure you didn't kill them.

574
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:24,012
Okay. Maybe I went a little too far.

575
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,422
But if I don't stand up for these bears,
who will?

576
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,653
If I can just relocate Waffles, okay?
Away from human populations.

577
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:34,559
I notice you're not defending
Waffles' innocence anymore.

578
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,090
Yeah, well, yeah...

579
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,326
Which means you did
your tests on Waffles...

580
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,937
...realized she did consume
some human flesh.

581
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:47,675
I don't get it, sheriff.
It just doesn't fit her profile.

582
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,472
WALT:
Well...

583
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,111
...I don't think it was her idea
to kill that guy, Pete.

584
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,843
Now...

585
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,752
...if you can just promise me that...

586
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,824
...you won't shoot any more people...

587
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:06,362
...I need help with a couple of things.
- Sure.

588
00:36:06,564 --> 00:36:10,660
I need to know if Jerry Stonesifer
or anybody else called in or stopped by...

589
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,530
...for information on bears here.

590
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:15,695
I can check our records.
What's the other thing?

591
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:27,648
If you tested Waffles' fur for isotopes
that only means one thing.

592
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,680
You have that bear.

Hello, Dan.

DAN:
Why'd you bring him up here?

599
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:14,387
I'm taking her north.
Thought I'd stop by on the way.

600
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,829
I wanted to talk to you about
Jerry Stonesifer.

601
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,162
He's a good guy.
Troubled, but a good guy.

602
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:22,932
- Troubled?
- Drugs. It happens.

603
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,836
Guards get locked in with prisoners,
bad things happen.

604
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,001
Nothing in Stonesifer's record
about that.

605
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,942
Well, like I said, he's a good guy...

606
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:33,048
...and I didn't think it was fair of me
to ruin his life.

607
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:35,378
So I just encouraged him to resign.

608
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,143
Why are you asking about Jerry?

609
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,551
I think he helped you kill Ed Crawley.

610
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,694
- Me?
- Yup.

611
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,056
- You messing with me, sheriff?
- Nope.

612
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:50,064
- A bear killed Ed Crawley.
- This bear. I know.

613
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,725
But the bear was just a weapon.
You guys killed him.

614
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,963
Stonesifer called up Ed Crawley,
told him about a job.

615
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,869
When he arrived,
you shot him with tranquilizer darts...

616
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,204
...then tied him to a tree
with meat on him...

617
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,813
...so a bear would come maul him.

618
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,142
That could be pretty hard to prove.

619
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:10,777
I never bought any animal tranquilizer,
never even called Ed Crawley.

620
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,891
It's possible Stonesifer did all that
stuff, but it was on your orders.

621
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:18,222
I'm guessing he owed you
for not firing him when you discovered...

622
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,990
...he was smuggling meth into the prison.

623
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,689
You let him resign on a partial pension.

624
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,734
You know, sheriff, I ain't no lawyer.

625
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:32,900
And clearly, you aren't either because
that's about the most circumstantial...

626
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,774
...speculative accusation ever drummed up
in the state of Wyoming.

627
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,211
- You got nothing on me.
- Think fast.

628
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:43,114
- Ah! What the hell?
- Now, I got something on you.

629
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,416
The scent of beef and blood...

630
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,787
...which is a smell that Waffles here
knows well. So here's the deal.

631
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,363
You tell me that you did
what I know you did...

632
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,994
...I won't unlock this cage.

633

[BEAR GRUNTING]

00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:05,136
You went to the Absaroka Bear Institute
to check on collared bears.

636
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,176
And you found one that already
had two livestock kills.

637
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,804
So you had to be sure and tie
Ed Crawley up close to this bear.

638
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:15,315
Knowing Waffles' taste for beef
you covered him in flank steak.

639
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:19,852
You're doing all this for Crawley?

640

That piece of garbage.

641
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,497
That animal killed one of my guards...

642
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,826
...and slaughtered
the Craigs' only daughter.

643

and threatening me?

than 30 miles an hour.

647
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,914
But you know the old joke.
Maybe I can't outrun this bear...

648
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,311
...but I can outrun you.

Leave Jerry out of this.
He didn't know anything.

He thought we were just gonna haze
Crawley a little bit.

655

What's the second favor?

656
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,105
I want Tommy Lee Jones
to play me in the movie...

657
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,743
...because people are gonna
see me as a hero.

00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,880
Because I am a hero.

nothing while a murderer walked free.

...because of Crawley.
