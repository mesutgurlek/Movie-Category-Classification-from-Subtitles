1
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:28,463
(birds chirping)

2
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,715
Man:
"Dear Ryan,

3
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:34,552
I reckon you're feeling lonely
now that your mother is gone.

4
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,680
You're too young
for something like this.

5
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,057
I know she must've
told you about me,

6
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,727
and I for one never stopped
thinking about you.

7
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,021
Even though
I've never seen you,

8
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,733
I bet my best memories
I'd recognize you in the blackest night.

9
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:52,487
These past years
have been hard on us all.

10
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,990
Very few of us
are still around.

11
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,951
The land where I live now
is a good one...

12
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,789
quiet people,
peaceful for the most part.

13
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,666
But it's not home.

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,712
That's why it's time for me
to come back.

15
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,006
Burn this letter
after you read it,

16
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,008
like your mother
would've done,

17
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,344
and wait for me.

18
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:20,306
Much love, your uncle."

19
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,417
(giggling)

20
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,962
(man shouting)

21
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,692
(speaking Spanish)
I can't come tomorrow.

22
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,868
We need you to pay us
for this week's work.

23
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,205
And for the seeds too.
You never paid for them.

24
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,126
You know where the money is.
Just take it.

25
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,294
No.

26
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,254
You're the boss.

27
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,548
You have to give it to me.

28
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,843
I can't take it.
That would be wrong.

29
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,637
I'm not your wife.

30
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,224
Sure.

31
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,938
You're right, Yana.

32
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,525
You're right.

33
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,406
(thunder rumbling)

34
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,867
I have rain gear.

35
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,789
Mr. James, you're going away,
aren't you?

36
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,252
My mother says all gringos leave
once they have enough money.

37
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,548
You're a gringo,
but you don't have that much money.

38
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:22,678
I'll have enough
after selling the horses.

39
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,599
Take care, Yana.

40
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,352
I'll see you
when I'm back from Potosi.

41
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,063
Then I'll leave for good.

Take care of him.

68
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,390
(car horn honks)

69
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,561
I'm withdrawing all my money.

70
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,314
In dollars, please.

71
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,247
Mr. Blackthorn,

72
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,666
have we done anything
to upset you?

73
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,252
Well, you know,
there is just one thing.

74
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,673
I can't remember ever being
so well received at a bank before.

75
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:48,342
Buenos dias.

76
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,999
(piano music playing)

77
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,169
Your whisky, sir.
American.

78
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,712
Here. Thanks.

79
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,716
Americans are
creatures of habit.

80
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,635
They have excellent
scotch here, French cognac,

81
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,637
but Mr. Blackthorn here

82
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,890
likes to stick to his
old gringo whisky.

83
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,475
Yeah, it just seems
to haunt me, you know.

84
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,895
To a fine sale.

85
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,646
Gracias.

86
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,316
You have quite a talent
for breeding horses.

87
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,027
Those horses will be the envy
of many men around here.

88
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,821
But you'd think
that here in Bolivia,

89
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,948
with so many bloody Indians,

90
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,783
it would be simple
to find good horses.

91
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,745
Indians got nothing
to do with it.

92
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,289
The terrain's too rugged here

93
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,458
for good horses, too high.

94
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,588
I was wondering if maybe
you all would like to play

95
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,757
a few rounds of cards.

96
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,218
What do you think?

97
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,345
Yes, we're in.

98
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,138
You know, I miss
a good game of cards

99
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,349
out on the ranch.

100
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,769
Ain't nothing but a goddamn bunch
of Indians out there, you know.

101
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,856
There's no civilized folk
like yourselves.

102
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,101
(whistles)

103
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,752

- (horse neighs)

105
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,709
Easy.

106
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,087
Don't leave me now, Cinco.

107
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,672
(snorts)

108
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,341
Whoa.

109
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,842
Easy, buddy.

110
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,764
Oh, easy, buddy.

111
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,223
(man speaking Spanish)
Don't move!

112
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,059
- (gunshot)
- (horse neighs)

113
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,686
- Come here, horse.
- (cocks gun)

114
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,937
That's it.

115
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,067
Man: Hiya!

116
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:38,655
- (horse neighs)
- (man grunting)

117
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,494
No. (whistles)

118
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,995
Cinco!

119
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,914
(whistles) Hey!

120
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:51,126
Whoa! Cinco!

121
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,588
God damn it!

122
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,472
- I'm out of bullets.
- Get up.

123
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,553
(grunts)

124
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,142
Please.

125
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,104
I'm freezing.

126
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,272
Are you Chilean?

127
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:56,942
Spanish.

128
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,278
Conquistador!

129
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,697
I just came here to work.

130
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,912
Are you going to kill me?

131
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,457
Oh, so you speak English.

132
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,586
You got any idea
where in the world we are?

133
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:19,089
Huh? We're in the middle
of nowhere.

134
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,884
My entire future ran off
with that horse,

135
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,345
everything I've got...
$6000 to get me back home.

136
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,806
The horse alone's worth $500.

137
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,350
Now I've got your miserable
life on my hands.

138
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,311
Ain't worth a nickel.

139
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,313
I'm sorry.

140
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,940
I thought you were after me.

141
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,444
Please, I just want
to live a little longer.

142
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,071
You do, huh?

143
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,292
Be my guest.

144
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,807
Man: Eat.

145
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,519
Eat, you
flea-ridden coward.

146
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,397
It was just a little jump.
(grunts)

147
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:20,317
"The best horses."
Filthy hag.

148
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,319
(grunts)

149
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,405
I'll run you all the way
from here to El Paso.

150
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,291
Oh shit.

151
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,546
Come on.

152
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,765
(gunshots)

153
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,434
What the hell
are you doing, Butch?

154
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,271
Not the best place to rest.

155
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,982
- It has a nice view.
- (chuckles)

156
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,286
(gunshots)

157
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,163
Oh, she's handy.

158
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,416
You teach her?

159
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:21,003
I don't think anybody
ever taught her anything.

160
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,213
And it's about time
you learned her name.

161
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,388
Kid, I think it's time
for us to go.

162
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,390
Don't worry.
Those were the last.

163
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,434
You're not listening.

164
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,103
I mean go as in leave,

165
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,857
go to South America now.

166
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,406
Butch wants to leave,

167
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,159
go to South America.

168
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,661
And he wants me
to go with him.

169
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,747
Why are you telling me?

170
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,374
I think it might be
a good idea...

171
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,835
the three of us...

172
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,379
that's all.

173
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,261
It's a great idea.

174
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,714
(cocks gun)

175
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,931
You're pushing
your luck, son.

176
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,352
Please.

177
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,106
They have been
following me for days.

178
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,691
I need your help.

179
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,440
All right, now you
can be on your way.

180
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,985
Taypi is only about 15 miles

181
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,112
down the tracks here.
You just follow it.

182
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,990
Even if I make it,
they'll catch me

183
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,992
and they'll kill me.

184
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,327
Well, good for them,
whoever they are.

185
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,413
- (gunshot)
- I'm not gonna repeat myself,

186
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,500
you son of a bitch.
Get up and get down the tracks.

187
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,502
Please.

188
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,464
Have pity and help me.

189
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:16,344
I can give you
your money back.

190
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,473
I have the money,
but it's hidden.

191
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,683
That's why they're after me.

192
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:28,023
You'd better not be
playing me, you bastard.

193
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,197
Man: It's two or three days
on horseback from here...

194
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,574
an abandoned mine.

195
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,576
I'm an engineer.

196
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,411
I work at the tin mines.

197
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,455
That's why I came over
from Spain.

198
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,957
When we get there,
I'll give you

199
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,043
your money back.
I promise.

200
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,545
That's not good enough.

201
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,927
I stole from the mine
I was working at in Oruro.

202
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,263
Those mines are well-guarded.
Patiño owns all that.

203
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,351
Yeah.

204
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,187
You stole from Simon Patiño?

205
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,359
You're plowing
in high cotton, boy.

206
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,111
Can I have a drink?

207
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,119
Patiño, huh?

208
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,581
Yes.

209
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,583
I robbed the Suyana Mine.

210
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:30,252
Patiño... you know him?

211
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,170
I know snakes,

212
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,298
no matter what hole
they crawl out of.

213
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,056
- How many's following you?
- I don't know.

214
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,767
A dozen maybe.
I'm not sure.

215
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,769
How far back are they?

216
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,189
A day or two.

217
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,817
Not anymore.

218
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,975
Who are you?

219
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,352
My name is Eduardo.

220
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,772
How much money
did you steal, Eduardo?

221
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,191
Not much.
Just enough to...

222
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,069
Nobody steals not much
from the richest man on the continent.

223
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,447
Now how much
did you steal?

224
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:43,325
£10,000 sterling.

225
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,453
$50,000 American,
more or less.

226
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:49,122
Yeah, well, that's
$25,000 for me then.

227
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,749
But you said $6,000.

228
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,169
Look, the only reason
that you're alive

229
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,379
is that you might have
some money.

230
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,089
Now you owe me half.

231
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,508
You owe me for every step
I take without a horse,

232
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,261
every hour I go without water.
And you also owe me

233
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,598
for not shooting your sorry ass
the first time I saw you.

234
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,350
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

235
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,936
Now shut the fuck up
and just follow me.

236
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,455
(Eduardo speaking Spanish)
Fuck!

237
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,500
Four days without a hat.

238
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,378
This plateau sun is killing me.

239
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,298
James:
Meet me at the cantina.

240
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,801
(door closes)

241
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,930
Keeper.

242
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,391
We only have chicha.

243
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,060
No. I want a pitcher of water.

244
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,062
There's only chicha.

245
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,522
Yeah...

246
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,946
Two Bolivianos.

247
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,341
(chuckles)

248
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,386
(speaks Aymara)

249
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,471
(speaking Spanish)
Gimme a drink.

250
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,808
And I want
two boxes of ammunition too.

251
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:32,976
The same as yours.

252
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,561
- I only have one.
- Okay.

253
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,730
Thanks.

254
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,985
I bought us
a couple of mules.

255
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,820
That's all there is
around here.

256
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,990
At least buy me a drink.
You'll soon be rich.

257
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,868
Nice pistol.

258
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,047
I should thank you.
I could have died.

259
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,132
The plateau is like hell.

260
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,176
You got no business
judging this land.

261
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,595
And I'm not
helping you either.

262
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:11,139
I'm just trying
to get back what's mine.

263
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,183
Okay.

264
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,770
So what do we do now?

265
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,605
Drink.

266
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,023
Okay, we agree on something.

267
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,192
In silence.

268
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,451
James:
Will you get your ass up?

269
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,495
I've got a couple
of mules here.

270
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,705
Let's get mounted.

271
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,002
Come on.

272
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,506
I'm ready when you are.

273
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,884
Hey.

274
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,762
Thank you.

275
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,139
You know, if that money
doesn't exist,

276
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:57,310
I'm going to kill you.
I'll take my sweet time doing it too.

277
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,233
(mule braying)

278
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,783
Eduardo:
Shouldn't we move faster?

279
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,245
James: Last time you moved faster
you killed your horse.

280
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,413
Don't you remember that?

281
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,624
I wouldn't say
I killed my horse.

282
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,876
You wouldn't, huh?
What would you say?

283
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,504
Hey, who do you
think you are?

284
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,048
We could get shot
any minute now

285
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:30,635
- and you acting like nothing...
- What? Come on.

286
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,222
Enough already!
Go to hell, man!

287
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,975
Go to fucking hell!

288
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,941
(horses approaching)

289
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,143
Eduardo: The last miner left
eight years ago.

290
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:24,105
There were 10,000 people
living here at one point.

291
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,400
Patiño was convinced
he could bleed a little more out of it.

292
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,944
So when I came over
from Spain,

293
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,946
he sent me here
and had me searching

294
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,449
six months for nothing.

295
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:38,620
I know this mine
like I dug it myself.

296
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,914
You'd better.

297
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:53,009
Are you going to kill me
when you get the money?

298
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:56,429
(chuckles) Come on,
let's get this over with.

299
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,642
Wait.

300
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,231
I have no reason
to trust you either.

301
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,525
There is a lot of money
at stake.

302
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,778
Where did you get
that antique?

303
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,030
I'm not so bad
with Bolivian women.

304
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,243
So you're going to
shoot me now?

305
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,744
Huh?

306
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,122
No, I don't want to.

307
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,708
We've been together for days

308
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,752
and I don't even
know your name.

309
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,338
I can't trust someone
with no name.

310
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:34,217
Well, you ought to trust me.

311
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:37,095
I saved your life a couple
of times, didn't I?

312
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,889
Besides, I'm not your problem.

313
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,891
That's your problem
over there.

314
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,476
What?

315
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,311
That dust.

316
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:53,152
Those could be several of your friends
at a full gallop.

317
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,363
(cocks gun)

318
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,659
You're empty, son.

319
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,286
You son of a bitch.

320
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,578
(chuckles)

321
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,831
Yeah.

322
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,584
You should've heard
what they called me back in Wyoming.

323
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,064
Eduardo:
We are close.

324
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,609
Next gallery to the left.
Watch your head.

325
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,447
When did you find out
I had the other revolver?

326
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,199
About 10 minutes ago.

327
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,752
Giddyup, son.
Bring the light.

328
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,629
I'm not a goddamn mole.

329
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,019
It's all here.

330
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,355
I'm willing to split it now.

331
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,857
- What's to split?
- Sorry?

332
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,068
There's nothing to split.
It's useless in here.

333
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,904
I mean, if you make it out of here
alive, it might be worth something,

334
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:21,449
but right now all you got
is your stupid gun and your lamp.

335
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,618
Now how the hell
do we get out of here?

336
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,579
- Just follow me.
- Yeah, that's what I've been doing.

337
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:29,916
Come on. The mine has lots of ways
out of the mountain.

338
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,170
(voices whispering)

339
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,513
Now what, Mr. Engineer?

340
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,976
Shoot the lights.
Leave them blind.

341
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,646
Okay, here's your gun back.

342
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,609
- Ready?
- Ready.

343
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,030
- (gunshots)
- (people chattering)

344
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,211
Goddamn Spaniard!

345
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,296
You call this a way out?

346
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,966
I could find my way out of hell
easier than this.

347
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:22,093
Thanks to this way out,

348
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,095
it'll be impossible for them

349
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,264
to pick up our trail
again, old man.

350
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,352
Where the hell are we?

351
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,617
- We are safe.
- Safe?

352
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,745
You stole $50,000.
You ain't gonna be safe for long.

353
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,998
Well, I guess I'll have
to live with that.

354
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,958
But I feel good.

355
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,170
I feel better than ever.

356
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,681
The name's James Blackthorn,

357
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,725
Utah, United States.

358
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,727
Eduardo Apodaca

359
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:16,606
from Madrid, Spain.

360
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,399
Rosario is not too far
from here.

361
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,735
We can buy cheap horses
over there.

362
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,029
I got me a little ranch
somewhere around here.

363
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,531
We can get some rest
up there.

364
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,953
Sometimes it's beautiful.

365
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,498
It is that.

366
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,678
You kept me waiting
for an hour for that?

367
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,514
You in a hurry?

368
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,934
Sometimes this is like having
a little friend along with you,

369
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,978
- maybe even better.
- Yeah.

(clanking)

402
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:39,165
You're rich, right?
I mean your family.

403
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,543
Well, I guess it depends on
whom you compare me to.

404
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:46,172
Poor people.

405
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,174
In that case, I reckon

406
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,635
you could say
I grew up comfortably.

407
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:55,181
Never rode with
a gentleman before.

408
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,184
Never thought I would.

409
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:00,770
(thunder rumbling)

410
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,064
James's voice:
"Friendship is the most valuable thing

411
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,066
a man can have.

412
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,862
It's worth more than money,
land, horses or cattle.

413
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,115
It might be the only thing
you never forget.

414
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,201
And it lasts forever.

415
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:18,746
Your father believed that.
Your mother did too."

416
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:38,224
You just have to hold
the cards steady.

417
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,770
Rattlesnake bites
are your thing,

418
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,439
not mosquitoes.

419
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,485
Etta bought these suits
so we could wear them, Butch.

420
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:52,947
Now get up off your sorry ass
and come downstairs with us.

421
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:56,325
Argentineans know plenty,
but not about poker...

422
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,620
Not about poker,
my friend.

423
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,664
You two are...

424
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,667
you're quite a sight.

425
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:08,129
All the more reason
for you to join us.

426
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,798
Go on, get out of here,
damn it.

427
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,675
I need some sleep.

428
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:16,053
Bring me up something to drink.
And watch yourselves.

429
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:20,141
Come on, Butch. Ain't nobody been
chasing us for a long time.

430
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,354
"Ain't nobody been
chasing us

431
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:28,482
for a long time."
Damn your eyes.

432
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,402
Shut up. We'd have been
long gone three days ago

433
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,238
if it hadn't been
for your mosquito bite.

434
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,241
I can't even pronounce
the name of this damn place.

435
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,286
San Juan.

436
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,288
Anyways,

437
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:44,498
and why the hell haven't
they put cuffs on us?

438
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,877
They probably don't have
any handcuffs.

439
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,672
This is humiliating.

440
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,299
You don't say.

441
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,551
(knocks on door)

442
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,974
Oh, here we go.

443
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,102
(speaks Spanish)
Sir.

444
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,189
Here are your gringo bandits.
One's sick.

445
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,361
Sorry to hear
you've not been too well.

446
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,363
Oh, it's just an insect bite,

447
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,324
Mr. Mackinley,
nothing serious.

448
00:35:18,492 --> 00:35:21,869
Yes, these places...
you never know

449
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,206
what'll be the next
damn insect or vermin

450
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,626
to rip a piece off of you.

451
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,711
Look.

452
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,298
Snakebite,
two years ago at Chaco.

453
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:38,260
There's a saying around here:
"Dos pasitos"..."Two steps."

454
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,263
They say by the third step
you're dead.

455
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,685
I got lucky.

456
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,522
This one

457
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,108
was last winter in Atacama...

458
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,277
a scorpion
the size of a clock.

459
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,279
I could hardly walk
for two months.

460
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:00,449
Then I was left
with this lump.

461
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:03,244
But I'm sure
I'm not telling you

462
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,955
a damn thing you don't
know yourselves.

463
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,499
We've all been
in the same places.

464
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,253
It was about time
we met face to face

465
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,879
finally.

466
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,508
Go to hell, Mackinley.
Let's get it over with.

467
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,802
- I can't wait.
- (knocks on door)

468
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,930
(speaks Spanish)
Open. It's the sheriff.

469
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,312
Sundance:
Mr. Albion Mackinley,

470
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,898
May I introduce
Miss Etta Place?

471
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,196
Well well, Mackinley.

472
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,073
My, you're a gentleman.

473
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,409
I thought all Pinkerton men

474
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:46,412
were bloodthirsty thugs

475
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,664
sold to the highest bidder.

476
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,791
You gonna run
in your underwear?

477
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,751
What?

478
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,670
(laughing)

479
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,718
(speaking Quechua)

480
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,557
(both laughing)

481
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:13,647
(speaking Spanish)
I have a gift for you.

482
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,489
It's a gringo machine.

483
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,575
Silver is best used
for other things.

484
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,243
I don't understand that time.

485
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,412
Yeah, me neither.

486
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,373
Don't do that! It's mine!

487
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,339
Keep it.

488
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,716
It's something
to remember me by.

489
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:45,262
Cheers.

490
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,056
To the two of you.

491
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,145
I'm going to go.
It's dark out.

492
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,899
Yana,

493
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,112
you know I'm going back
to my country tomorrow.

494
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,697
For good.

495
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,325
Spend the night here, please.

496
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,078
I can't.

497
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,540
My family's waiting for me.
It's dark out.

498
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,669
Sure.

499
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,595
I have rain gear.

500
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,141
- No?
- No.

501
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,280
Goodbye, Mr. James.
Take care of yourself.

502
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:12,808
What about all this?

503
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,519
This?

504
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,939
Eh, it's just a place.

505
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,817
Yana and her family
will make good use of it.

506
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,278
They live off the land.

507
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,698
More?

508
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:40,794
About two months ago
I got a letter from San Francisco.

509
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:45,466
A woman I'd loved very much

510
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,635
died of tuberculosis,

511
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,637
left an only kid...

512
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,349
a son I've never
seen before.

513
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:59,438
So I figured...

514
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:05,110
now might be a good time
to go back

515
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,112
and pay him a visit, you know,

516
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,240
keep each other company.

517
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,242
Sometimes I think

518
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,329
there's only two moments
in a man's life:

519
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,331
One's when he leaves home;
and the other one's

520
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:19,583
when he returns.

521
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:23,879
Everything else is just
in the middle.

522
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,881
Well, looks like
we'll be headed

523
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,634
in different
directions, ain't we?

524
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,098
- (footsteps)
- (horse tack jingling)

525
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,257
Mr. James?

526
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,593
Yana?

527
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,851
(horse neighs)

528
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,650
(snoring)

529
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,552
Good morning.

530
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,805
What do you want?

531
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,683
We found your horse
in the desert four days ago.

532
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,645
Where is he?

533
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:04,813
He's dead.

534
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:07,649
But we have your blankets
and your money.

535
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,820
James:
So?

536
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,199
Where's your friend
the Spaniard?

537
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,873
What friend?

538
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,124
- Fucking gringo!
- (gunshot)

539
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,792
(horse neighs)

540
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,426
(Yana panting)

541
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,475
(gun clicks)

542
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,121
(panting)

543
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,472
(gunshots)

544
00:43:43,246 --> 00:44:00,679
Yana.

545
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,197
(James groaning)

546
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,087
Yana!

547
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:36,274
That's enough.

548
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,950
All right, let's get
this over with.

549
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,743
Go.

550
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:51,164
Argh!

551
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,333
Shit!

552
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:04,010
Here, you might need
to use this.

553
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,958
Thanks for that.

554
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,887
They're smart.

555
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,681
Someone must have told them
we were together,

556
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:53,143
so they sent two women
so we wouldn't suspect.

557
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,353
When they realize
they are not coming back,

558
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,606
they will come after us.

559
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,156
(speaking Aymara)

560
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,561
(train horn blowing)

561
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:39,356
(crossing bells dinging)

562
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,707
Is he waiting outside?

563
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,126
Yeah.

564
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,713
It's a long trip.

565
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,383
If I made it here,
I can make it back.

566
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,305
We all can.

567
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,768
He'll forgive you.

568
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,770
You know what he's like.

569
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:22,941
Nothing to forgive, Butch.
I'm not walking out on you.

570
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:25,819
I'm just defending
what's ours.

571
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,029
Conductor:
ISale a Oruro!

572
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,198
(horn blows)

573
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,827
Conductor:
Pasajeros con destino a Oruro

574
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:35,662
a abordar el tren.

575
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,291
ISale a Oruro!

576
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,043
Come with me.

577
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,837
Come on.

578
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,047
You're not young anymore.

579
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:50,677
Truth be told,
we're still losing, Butch.

580
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,805
You'd never have any peace.

581
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,307
(train horn blows)

582
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,521
Conductor:
IUltimo llamado!

583
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,148
(bell dinging)

584
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,525
I love you both.

585
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,529
Tell him.

586
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:17,579
Wait, what will you name it?

587
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,372
Ryan.

588
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,021
She'll come back.

589
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,106
I know it.

590
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:48,568
Of course.

591
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,071

605
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,620
There's nothing
more beautiful,

606
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:43,623
like a sweet death.

607
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,625
It'll be tough,

608
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,253
but it's the only way
across those mountains.

609
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:50,255
The other side...
I can catch me

610
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:53,383
a boat back home
from Chile or Peru.

611
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,931
(chuckles)

612
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:03,017
Come on over here, son.

613
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,563
Get down.

614
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,610
Drop your pants.

615
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,237
Are you nuts?

616
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,573
If we don't heal
those saddle wounds,

617
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:19,242
you can't ride.
You're gonna die out here.

618
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,578
Come on, turn around.

619
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,209
You ready?

620
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:30,587
This might sting a little bit.

621
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:33,006
Oy.

622
00:51:33,174 --> 00:51:35,675
(grunting)

623
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,387
Argh!

624
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,014
There you go.

625
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,600
- Fuck!
- (chuckles)

626
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,314
Your ass is softer
than a bookkeeper's.

627
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,483
You okay?

628
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,110
Yeah.

629
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,867
James: It's been a long time
since I've been out here.

630
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,538
I like these places.

631
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,874
They can't be used.

632
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,292
They got no owners.

633
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,212
But they will.
That's how life works.

634
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,881
Well, I hope I'm dead
when that day comes.

635
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:21,805
James, I wanted to say,

636
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,349
all that happened
about Yana and...

637
00:52:24,517 --> 00:52:26,392
Nah.

638
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,687
Look, I knew the risks
as well as you, going in.

639
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,357
There's nothing to say.

640
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,654
We should shelter up
down there.

641
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:40,406
It's gonna freeze tonight.

642
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,284
James:
These horses ain't gonna last very long

643
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,871
at this altitude...
no air, no water.

644
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:52,335
Eduardo:
What did you do in your country?

645
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,337
(James chuckles)

646
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:58,424
I think you got a pretty
good idea, don't you?

647
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:01,386
(Eduardo chuckles)

648
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:06,432
James:
We covered more than six states

649
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,645
back in the day,

650
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:15,567
some of 'em bigger
than this whole country.

651
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,152
Of course things were
different back then.

652
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,031
There was room
for everybody.

653
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,494
Then the railroad came in
and the big ranchers

654
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:30,415
and everything changed.

655
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:34,335
It turned into a kind of a war.

656
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:38,673
We ended up on the losing end
of the stick.

657
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,300
And why Bolivia?

658
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:44,387
It was far far away.

659
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,306
Far away from what?

660
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,266
Everything.

661
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:51,728
See, one day

662
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:55,148
I woke up

663
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:57,066
and found myself alone.

664
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,152
Seemed like everybody I knew

665
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,821
was either dead or in jail.

666
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:03,990
They thought I was dead too.

667
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,617
So I just did

668
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,619
what any good
dead person would do.

669
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,872
I went off and raised me
some horses.

670
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,249
20 years...

671
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:15,793
that was a big change.

672
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,671
Quiet times.

673
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,841
You see, I'm too long
in the tooth

674
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,843
to go off and be what
I used to be, you know...

675
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:26,137
just an ordinary
old bandit.

676
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:29,641
You should have become
a rancher too.

677
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:33,728
You'd be rich now,
instead of being here with me.

678
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:36,522
Rich?

679
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,525
I've been my own man.

680
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:43,279
Ain't nothing richer than that.

681
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,448
Had some good friends too.

682
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,583
They don't sleep.

683
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:01,005
Sure you killed a few not-so-friendly
in those days, huh?

684
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,758
Me? I've never
had to kill nobody.

685
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:06,469
So far.

686
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,638
Come on, let's get these
horses saddled up.

687
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:22,652
(speaking Aymara)

688
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,957
James:
They must be very well paid.

689
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:39,961
I've never seen anybody
take so much punishment.

690
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:42,588
Eduardo: We should have never tried
to cross the salt flats.

691
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,341
James: It's the only way.
Otherwise they'd have surrounded us

692
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,343
and we wouldn't even
see it coming.

693
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,138
This way all they can do
is track us

694
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,349
and see whose horses
die first.

695
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,746
(horse huffing)

696
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,414
Vamos.

697
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,208
(grunts)

698
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:26,215
(horse huffing)

699
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,429
Grab the rifle and the water
and come on.

700
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:33,890
Mount up.

701
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,854
- (gunshot)
- (horses neigh)

702
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,065
Come on, let's go.

703
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,967
(yelling in Aymara)

704
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,235
Three men on horseback.

705
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,196
We still have a few minutes.

706
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:34,200
We stand a chance here, right?

707
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:36,911
I don't know.

708
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,790
James,

709
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,917
I'm glad I'm with you.

710
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:46,671
You know, before I met you...
damn the day...

711
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:49,132
I thought if I was gonna
die of old age,

712
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,134
I might as well
go back home to do it.

713
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,971
But, hell, this seems like
as good a day as any to die.

714
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:57,682
We are not gonna die, old man.

715
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:00,434
Of course not, son.
Nobody ever does.

716
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,603
Just in case, we ought
to bury this money

717
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,189
before Patiño gets
his hands on it again.

718
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:08,234
Too late.
They are too close.

719
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,910
They're gonna surround us.
They know we're here.

720
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:31,174
(whispers)
Dios mio.

721
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:39,891
What are we gonna do?

722
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,867
(cocks rifle)

723
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,709
All right, look.

724
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,212
You take the good horse
and the money.

725
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,964
Head southeast.
You follow that mountain range.

726
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:14,884
- If you're lucky, you'll wind up in Tupiza.
- What?

727
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:17,053
I'm gonna take the other horse
and head southwest.

728
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:19,931
Their horses have to be wiped out by now.
I'll meet you down there.

729
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,225
- But...
- It's the only way to do it... splitting up.

730
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:26,270
- They'll kill us.
- This desert will kill you before they do.

731
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,606
I don't want to be
by myself.

732
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,359
Your horse will make it,
don't worry.

733
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:37,865
All right, just remember...
southeast, okay?

734
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,701
And don't buy one of those goddamn
mansions full of flowers, all right?

735
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,037
- You spend that money quick.
- But...

736
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:45,122
(whistles) Hiya!

737
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,624
Shit!

738
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:58,261
(whistles)

739
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:09,772
Yahoo!

740
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,693
Yahoo! Yah!

741
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,861
Yah!

742
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:23,869
- (gunshot)
- (horse neighs)

743
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:27,623
(grunts)

744
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,365
(grunting)

745
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,201
(speaking Spanish)
Don't move.

746
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,622
Don't move!

747
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,136
Drop the gun,
you son of a bitch.

748
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:40,154
(panting)

749
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,643
(gun clicks)

750
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:14,897
(clicks)

751
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,701
(speaking Spanish)
How many times did we go out

752
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:12,496
hunting together, my friend?

753
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:14,248
(cocks gun)

754
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:17,251
Fucking Spaniard!

755
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,545
(gunshot)

756
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,366
(horse huffing)

757
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,012
(gunfire)

758
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,944
Whoa.
Get on, Sundance.

759
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,118
Ain't nobody following us.

760
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:58,454
They think we're back
at the corral.

761
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:01,123
The bullet's still inside.

762
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:05,794
You think the Chilean and the Yankee
will make it?

763
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:08,130
When they find their bodies,
they'll think they're us.

764
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:10,299
Then we're free.

765
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:13,344
I like being dead.

766
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,220
Hell, if I'd only known sooner.

767
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,681
Give me your hand, Sundance.

768
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:20,809
I should've gone with Etta

769
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,270
and the boy.

770
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:27,441
A son... that's more than a lot of people
have to say for themselves.

771
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:31,320
Don't you think?

772
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:34,198
What makes you think
he's yours, you desert dog?

773
01:06:34,366 --> 01:06:37,826
Oh, it doesn't matter.
He'll still be my son.

774
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:41,205
Let's head for
the mountains, Butch.

775
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:43,957
We'll cross those mountains
and go home.

776
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:48,212
Damn Bolivian army...

777
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,714
worst aim I've ever seen.

778
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:15,197
(pounding on door)

779
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,707
(speaking Spanish)
Goddamn little doctor!

780
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,167
I told you, I'll pay you.

781
01:07:27,335 --> 01:07:28,961
I was just fine in the bar!

782
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:31,255
That's not why I called for you.

783
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:33,632
Mr. Mackinley,
come in, come in.

784
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:41,306
When you worked
for the Pinkertons,

785
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:45,436
you came here to Bolivia
chasing bandits, right?

786
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,438
Well, that's excellent!

787
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,523
I found my memory!

788
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:53,694
And it turns out it's
a goddamn Bolivian quack.

789
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,990
If I remember right,
you always said

790
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:02,161
the men they killed in San Vicente
weren't your bandits.

791
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:06,665
Well, you might have been right.

792
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,918
But...

793
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,755
you're not too drunk, are you?

794
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,381
Fuck off.

795
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:16,133
Well,

796
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:20,095
now we're going to see
if you were right or not.

797
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:22,431
Look.

798
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:46,663
Sweet Jesus.

799
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,627
Sweet suffering Jesus,
it's him.

800
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,754
It's him, isn't it?

801
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:55,672
Yes.

802
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,008
Robert Leroy Parker.

803
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:00,385
Butch Cassidy.

804
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:03,555
All of them will apologize to me.

805
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,600
All those bastards.

806
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:09,353
What's he got?

807
01:09:09,521 --> 01:09:11,063
A bullet wound,

808
01:09:11,231 --> 01:09:14,358
dehydration and fatigue.

809
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,152
He just needs to rest.

810
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,366
Rest...

811
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:38,632
(distant rooster crows)

812
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:04,825
Here we are.

813
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,209
You and me.

814
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,630
(coughing)

815
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,143
Water!

816
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:43,530
You're in poor shape,

817
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:45,532
even worse
than the last time

818
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,743
we saw each other.

819
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:52,623
What the fuck are you
doing in Bolivia?

820
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,542
Haven't you got
anything better to do?

821
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,377
And where's my pistol?

822
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:04,009
What should I call you?

823
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:09,181
I've been going under Blackthorn.
Doesn't matter.

824
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:13,518
It matters.
Of course it does.

825
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:19,816
I never believed
you were dead, you know.

826
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,576
Strange world,

827
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:33,664
wouldn't you agree,
Mr. Blackthorn?

828
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,309
I'm what they call
an honorary consul...

829
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:56,603
$89 a month,

830
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:58,605
a one-bedroom house

831
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:01,817
with a bed too small
for my tastes.

832
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:05,362
I just greet the few
North Americans

833
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,614
that show up around here...

834
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:10,158
gold diggers,
people buying wool,

835
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,994
drunkards,
an occasional runaway...

836
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,455
not many people.

837
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:20,085
The last one came by

838
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:23,213
two winters past.

839
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:26,717
I spend the rest of time
looking out the window.

840
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:30,971
Huh, sad story.
Not much of a life.

841
01:12:31,139 --> 01:12:32,973
No. No, it's not.

842
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:35,684
But I couldn't aspire
to much more...

843
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,355
until today.

844
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:43,150
Last night I thought

845
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:46,028
everything could
change for me.

846
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,656
I could even buy a huge bed

847
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:53,952
and travel home on it,
smiling and waving

848
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:57,372
as I passed.

849
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:03,378
But, Mr. Blackthorn,

850
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:07,799
these past few hours
at your side

851
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:10,927
have reminded me
of many things...

852
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,929
the fatigue,

853
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:17,893
the years of pursuit.

854
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:22,189
Carrying out one's duty is,

855
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:25,067
believe me,

856
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:29,029
exhausting.

857
01:13:29,197 --> 01:13:33,992
Here in this
godforsaken village

858
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,370
I finally found some rest...

859
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:39,581
a stupid

860
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,292
but well-deserved rest.

861
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:46,171
Well,

862
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:49,299
I guess we can't be blamed
for growing older.

863
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,635
We're too old
to keep on playing.

864
01:13:51,803 --> 01:13:54,971
Never was a game with me.

865
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,474
Of course it was...

866
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,393
an absurd, deadly game.

867
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:03,480
Eh, you never understood.
Doesn't matter.

868
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:06,691
Of course I understood.
I was part of the game.

869
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,819
But this time...

870
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:11,071
There's no handcuffs either.

871
01:14:11,239 --> 01:14:14,366
This time you're on your own.

872
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:17,160
No one will come
to the rescue.

873
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:19,746
Do whatever
you need to do.

874
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,307
Take it.

875
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:44,563
Consider it a way
to continue resting.

876
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:56,324
An army battalion
is on its way here.

877
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,326
I sent for them.

878
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,871
This is the most important thing to have
happened around here

879
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:03,790
since... well,
since your death.

880
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,208
(chuckles)

881
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:09,171
I'll get you to a safe place.

882
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,298
You'll leave

883
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:14,759
and you'll never come back.

884
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:18,763
Things will still be the same.

885
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:25,395
You're a right pain
in the ass, Cassidy...

886
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:29,900
a right fucking
pain in the ass.

887
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:35,030
(speaking Spanish)
We're here.

888
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,918
There's food and chicha in here.

889
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,127
Thanks.

890
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,341
I know what you are, sir.

891
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,928
Please, don't steal from me.

892
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,267
Iván...

893
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:06,728
you won't say anything,
will you?

894
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,023
No, sir. You're my guest.

895
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:39,344
(church bells ringing)

896
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:34,607
James's voice:
"Dear Ryan, I have enough money now

897
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,943
for us to start
a brand-new life...

898
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,487
maybe horses, ranching.

899
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:42,532
I've met an old friend
of your father and mother's.

900
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,285
He remembers them often.
They were one of a kind.

901
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:48,163
There's not much blood
like yours left.

902
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:51,041
I'm on my way back.

903
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,543
I don't know how long it will take...
not more than two months.

904
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:57,047
With love,
your Uncle Butch."

905
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:02,635
Hey, I was just
writing about you.

906
01:18:02,803 --> 01:18:05,055
I should have left you
in the damn clinic.

907
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:09,684
Eduardo Apodaca
is a friend of yours?

908
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,686
Have you seen him?
Where is he?

909
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:14,439
He's heading west through the canyons.
He was in Tupiza,

910
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,983
but made himself scarce
when he saw the uproar

911
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,985
caused by your resurrection.

912
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:23,365
I haven't betrayed you,
but my help stops here.

913
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,409
What the hell
are you talking about?

914
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:32,040
Damn chicha.

915
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,417
Is it money you're after?

916
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:38,004
You can stick your dirty
money where it fits.

917
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:41,007
You were better off
dead, Cassidy.

918
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:43,343
And I hope you soon will be.

919
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:45,637
I'll drink until I forget this,

920
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:48,223
but for you

921
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:52,936
all the liquor in this shitty world
wouldn't be enough.

922
01:18:53,104 --> 01:18:55,563
In my day

923
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,732
the outlaws would have
robbed banks

924
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,818
and the Union Pacific.

925
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:03,571
They would never have stolen
from the mining families, no sir.

926
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:07,283
Mining families?
You better get off the bottle, Mackinley.

927
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:10,078
- You're losing your Irish mind.
- Go to hell.

928
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:11,871
He never stole from
the mining families.

929
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:15,458
It's Patiño...
the Suyana Mine.

930
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:17,085
You believe that?

931
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:21,005
He tricked you
into believing that?

932
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:23,967
Jesus, I almost pity you.

933
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:26,636
Your Spanish friend
didn't work for Patiño.

934
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:30,056
He worked for the miners.
The mine is theirs.

935
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:33,101
They took it from Patiño
two years ago.

936
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,519
What rock were you
hiding under?

937
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,063
The whole country
was talking about it.

938
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:41,025
The miners rebelled
against the owners...

939
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,445
overdue wages, murders...
the usual.

940
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:47,615
There was a huge battle.
A lot of miners got killed.

941
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,535
Then justice stepped in and...

942
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,954
this country is
full of surprises...

943
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:55,748
they decided in favor
of the miners.

944
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:59,502
They awarded ownership of the mine
to the surviving families.

945
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,546
This is no coincidence,
of course...

946
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,507
the mine was almost empty.

947
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:06,759
Even the Spanish engineer
who worked for Patiño

948
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,636
stood up for them.

949
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:12,348
Poor fools,
they trusted a Spaniard.

950
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:20,315
There are times
when you'd prefer to be dead,

951
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:24,194
don't you agree?

952
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:30,658
Goodbye and good riddance,
Mr. Blackthorn.

953
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:27,924
(children laughing)

954
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:36,307
(speaking Spanish)
Here you go, sir.

955
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:44,524
We'll catch him.
He can't be far away.

956
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,736
Or what do you think, Mackinley?

957
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:55,952
WANTED
$10,000 REWARD

958
01:21:58,747 --> 01:21:59,747
No.

959
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,125
It's not him.

960
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:04,502
It's not the one
who escaped from the clinic.

961
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,296
Cassidy died years ago.

962
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:10,049
Are you crazy, Mackinley?
You recognized him yourself!

963
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:11,676
It wasn't him.

964
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:14,178
Of course it's him!

965
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:18,224
This is the man I left
in my clinic, with you.

966
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:20,977
You're a fucking sentimentalist.

967
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,316
Mackinley.

968
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:32,488
We're going to see
if you're right or not.

969
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:35,742
We leave at dawn.

970
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:37,744
And you're coming with us.

971
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:36,969
- (horse snorting)
- (hoofbeats)

972
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,997
Okay, let's go, kid.

973
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:50,668
(groaning)

974
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:55,256
Butch: Shit.

975
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,679
You'll get my suit dirty.

976
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:04,015
It'll help keep you warm.

977
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,941
Everybody will think we're dead

978
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,110
and look at us...

979
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:19,697
strong as trees,

980
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:21,991
snow-covered trees.

981
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:27,121
Bolivia.

982
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:32,418
God damn it, Bolivia.

983
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:36,547
Always knew
you'd be the last.

984
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:39,801
Everybody's dead and you...

985
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,720
you're all alone now

986
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:46,474
so far from home,

987
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:49,769
my poor friend.

988
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:55,316
Okay.

989
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:58,069
Do it.

990
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:05,243
Now is a good time.

991
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:08,412
Do it.

992
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:25,847
(gunshot)

993
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:05,928
James.

994
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:07,972
Hey.

995
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,141
Or should I say Butch?

996
01:27:10,309 --> 01:27:13,352
Mr. Butch Cassidy himself.

997
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,855
(laughs)
I knew it.

998
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:18,107
That explains
so many things.

999
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:20,109
You know what?

1000
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:23,154
In Tupiza
everyone was shouting

1001
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:25,865
that the famous
gringo outlaw was alive.

1002
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:28,409
And me buying new clothes...

1003
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,870
can you imagine?

1004
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:35,708
Take it easy.
They still must be far.

1005
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:47,595
So here we are

1006
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:50,139
just a few hours
from freedom

1007
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:52,975
and the good life.

1008
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:54,602
Are you okay?

1009
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,772
You can't think
I abandoned you, right?

1010
01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:00,942
I just couldn't stay there
with so much going on.

1011
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:03,653
And I knew you'd turn up.

1012
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:09,033
That mine didn't belong
to Patiño?

1013
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:27,009
And your name is not
James Blackthorn.

1014
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:30,888
Well, we all have our secrets.

1015
01:28:31,056 --> 01:28:33,599
But now all the cards
are on the table.

1016
01:28:36,103 --> 01:28:38,813
No. You're right.
It wasn't his any longer.

1017
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:41,273
So what?

1018
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:45,778
It had different owners...
owners anyway.

1019
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:48,572
$50,000, James.

1020
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:52,159
That's no lie.
Come on, let's go.

1021
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,704
Look, there are
your mountains.

1022
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:57,623
We're almost there.
I'll be your gang now...

1023
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,626
you and me, James.
You and me.

1024
01:29:00,794 --> 01:29:03,129
You said yourself...
you were dead,

1025
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:05,381
breeding horses
in that old house.

1026
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:08,300
Now you have money
and you have it all...

1027
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:10,511
your name, your life.

1028
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:13,764
You're a damn legend,
and here you are.

1029
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:16,225
Here you are.

1030
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,603
Here I am.

1031
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:22,481
(screaming)

1032
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:32,241
Have you gone crazy?!

1033
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:33,909
Motherfucker!

1034
01:29:34,077 --> 01:29:36,328
They'll be here shortly.

1035
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:38,539
This time they've got
the army with them.

1036
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:39,874
But you shot me!

1037
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,293
Son of a bitch!

1038
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:50,718
Is it the money?

1039
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:54,513
How can you, bastard?

1040
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:56,849
You never did see
the difference, did you?

1041
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:03,814
For the Indians?

1042
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:06,650
For a bunch of miners?
For them?

1043
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:08,903
And what about me?

1044
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:11,030
I'm your friend.

1045
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:14,700
I gave you everything...
everything.

1046
01:30:14,868 --> 01:30:16,827
I saved your life.

1047
01:30:16,995 --> 01:30:19,663
I gave you
your name back, I did.

1048
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:23,334
Difference?
What's the fucking difference?

1049
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,461
What's the fucking difference?

1050
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,228
Are you going to leave me
like this,

1051
01:30:42,395 --> 01:30:44,814
you son of a bitch?

1052
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:47,650
Are you?

1053
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:53,989
Okay. Okay.

1054
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:55,991
Give the money
back to them.

1055
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:58,077
Give the money back
to them,

1056
01:30:58,245 --> 01:31:01,872
but don't leave me
here, please.

1057
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:05,501
Please.

1058
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:17,638
Damn you, Butch Cassidy!

1059
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:20,099
Damn you!

1060
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:22,935
I could have killed you!

1061
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:25,771
I could have killed you

1062
01:31:25,939 --> 01:31:29,108
and I didn't.

1063
01:31:31,695 --> 01:31:34,572
But they'll do it for me.

1064
01:31:34,739 --> 01:31:36,615
They'll track you down

1065
01:31:36,783 --> 01:31:39,660
and kill you like a dog.

1066
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:50,129
Don't leave me here, please.
