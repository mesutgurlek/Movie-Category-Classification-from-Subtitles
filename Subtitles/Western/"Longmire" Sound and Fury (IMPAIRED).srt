Why do you say that?

Last week,
Bill called me in a rage.

488
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:57,558
He was going through
some of Diane's e-mails

489
00:23:57,643 --> 00:24:00,427
and he found a file
with a bunch of stuff

490
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:03,981
to and from a divorce attorney
at Pierce-Strahan.

491
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:07,151
She's had divorce plans
in the works for six months.

492
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:09,620
She was waiting
to pull the trigger.

493
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:11,372
Why was she waiting?

494
00:24:11,456 --> 00:24:14,992
Well, she was waiting
for Bill's rich mother to die,

495
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,911
which she did 10 days ago.

496
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:18,245
So Diane's half
of the divorce settlement

497
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,114
just went up $1.2 million.

498
00:24:20,215 --> 00:24:22,116
That's a reason
for him to want to kill her,

499
00:24:22,217 --> 00:24:23,501
not the other way around.

500
00:24:23,618 --> 00:24:25,086
She could just pull the trigger
on the divorce,

was everything.

At first,
I didn't think anything of it,

in Durant of all places

of this whole thing.

You think Bill hired your friend
to kill his wife?

It's possible.

He's an ex-cop, so he's
certainly got the training.

647
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:04,634
So, Bill uses his lawyer's phone
to call the killer,

maybe arranging a meeting
to call off the hit.

that Bill's blood type

Which one do you think I am?

800
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:00,482
Don't get too clever.

801
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:02,651
Just keep your foot
on the gas pedal, Henry.

802
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:05,004
Very well.

803
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:06,455
[ Engine revs ]

804

[ Gun cocks ]

808
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:29,228
Get back, sheriff!
Walt: Drop the gun!

809
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:31,146
Get back. Drop the gun.

810
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:33,315
No, I don't think so.

811
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,517
I see your Southern accent
disappeared.

812
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:37,036
[ Southern accent ] Shoot...
y'all think I didn't know

813
00:40:37,153 --> 00:40:38,370
you was recording
them phone calls?

814
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:39,788
I ain't stupid.

815
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:42,575
You let him go,
I'll let you go.

816
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:43,792
[ Normal voice ] No, no, no.

817
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:45,628
You're not
making the deals here.

818
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:48,831
So, let me ask you, sheriff...

819
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:51,300
how much is Henry's life
here worth to you, huh?

820
00:40:51,384 --> 00:40:54,169
It's tough
to put a number on it.

821
00:40:54,254 --> 00:40:57,172
I've known this man
since I was a boy.

822
00:40:57,257 --> 00:41:01,227
That's a long time.
It's a lot to add up.

823
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:03,211
How much?!

824
00:41:03,313 --> 00:41:06,148
I got $20 in my pocket.

825
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:11,237
His friendship's
worth more than that.

826
00:41:11,354 --> 00:41:16,108
Looking at Henry's truck,
I'd say the axle's broken.

827
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:17,776
[ Metal creaks ]

828
00:41:17,894 --> 00:41:21,730
So my vehicle
is your only chance to escape.

829
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:27,119
You sell it whenever
you get where you're going,

830
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:28,420
that's something.

831
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,379
What about your cellphone?

832
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:40,466
It's in the truck.
Part of the deal.

833
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:43,185
It's a simple trade, zip.

834
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,689
Nobody's gonna stop you
in a sheriff's vehicle.

835
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:55,731
All right. Hey, look...
you toss the keys.

836
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:57,599
You do it nice and easy.

837
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:59,618
Walt, do not.

838
00:41:59,736 --> 00:42:01,603
I got no choice, Henry.

Good shot.

00:42:37,741 --> 00:42:42,611
Well, not gonna let him
take my truck.
