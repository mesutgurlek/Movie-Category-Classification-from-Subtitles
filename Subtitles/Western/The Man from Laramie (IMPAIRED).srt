00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:22,422
I'd go a couple more

All right. I'll be along.

18

Standing here thinking about
it won't bring him back.

19
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,255
Nah. But it reminds me of
what I came here to do.

20
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:34,592
Hate's unbecoming
in a man like you.

00:06:37,756 --> 00:06:39,804
Laramie? How you get through?

31
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:42,227
I guess we were lucky. Where
do you want them unloaded?

32
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,304
I don't know.

33
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:47,106
Well, who does? Where's the boss?

34
00:06:47,224 --> 00:06:50,228
- Upstairs.

I'm looking for the owner
of the mercantile.

I'm the owner.

41
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:23,556
Oh, well. I see. Well,
I have three wagonloads...

42
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:25,504
- of supplies for you outside...
- Oh, no.

43
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,682
I was hoping those supplies
would never arrive.

44
00:07:27,764 --> 00:07:29,913
Well, I thought you'd be
anxious to get these goods.

45
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:31,723
They're paid for. You
seem to need 'em.

46
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:34,888
I was all sold out and hoping I
could stop being a storekeeper.

47
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:40,202
Well, sorry to disappoint you, ma'am.
Where do you want the supplies unloaded?

48
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:46,576
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- What? Oh.

49
00:07:47,158 --> 00:07:50,128
Well, it's a long time since
I've had tea with a lady.

50
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,047
It'd be kind of nice.

51

- Pull up a chair.
- Thank you.

- What's your name?
- Will Lockhart, ma'am.

53

Mine's Barbara Waggoman.
Do you take sugar?

54
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:09,765
Mmm, yes, when I can get it.

55
00:08:09,848 --> 00:08:13,773
You know, I've been in rooms like this
before, but not in this part of the country.

56
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:16,212
My father brought these things
from our home in Connecticut.

57
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,153
Oh. A man of very
fine taste, I'd say.

58
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:21,951
Father had an appreciation
for fine living.

59
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:26,783
But he wasted it in this store, emptying
flower barrels and measuring cotton cloth.

60
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:27,776
I see.

61
00:08:27,802 --> 00:08:31,278
There must be more to life than
emptying barrels of flour.

62
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,581
Yes, I'd say so.

63
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:36,917
I've wanted to leave Coronado
ever since my father died,

64
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,600
but the stage for Santa Fe stopped
running because of the Apaches.

65
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:42,885
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you have any trouble getting here?

66
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:45,725
- No, we came from Laramie.
- Oh, is that your home?

67
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,805
No, ma'am. No, I...

68
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:53,233
I can't rightly say
any place my home.

69
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:55,276
But everybody should
have some place to...

70
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:58,947
to remember and feel
like they belong to.

71
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:03,653
Well, I... I always feel
I belong where I am.

72
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:07,914
Must be wonderful
to feel like that.

73
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:17,257
Oh, is there any place around
town my men and I can find rooms?

74
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:20,719
- Right over the café.
- Oh. Fine.

75
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,180
Well, I guess I'd better start
unloading those supplies.

76
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:31,597
We'll unpack them all and get
them into the shelves for you.

77
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,230
- Thanks for the tea, Miss Waggoman.
- You're welcome, Mr. Lockhart.

78
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,187
- Bye.
- Bye.

79
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:01,969
- Sell very many of these repeating rifles?
- No. Too much money.

80
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:05,589
- Where'd you get this one?
- Indian traded it for supplies.

81
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:09,768
Mm-hmm. I wonder where an
Indian would get a rifle like this.

82
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:13,268
He don't say. I don't ask.

83
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,941
Suppose you come out and help
the fellas unload this stuff, huh?

84
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,956
- They tell me you're from Snake River.
- Yeah.

85
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,959
Well, we expect an
honest deal here.

86
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:41,716
Just had one. I hope
we get another one.

87
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,465
I do too, if the work is right.

88
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:48,424
- Pass.
- I can't open.

89
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,641
See ya in a minute.

90
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:14,249
- Good evening, Miss Waggoman.
- Good evening, Mr. Lockhart.

91
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:16,827
It's a nice evening.

92
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:20,709
You're the only one in
town I know to talk to.

93
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,925
- Maybe you can help me.
- How can I help you?

94
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,095
Well, I just hate to make that
trip back with three empty wagons.

95
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:31,391
I sort of thought maybe you could tell me
where I could pick up a load of freight.

96
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:34,603
- There's some salt lagoons nearby.
- Is that so?

97
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:36,554
They're awful close to Apache land.

98
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:40,222
Well, is this salt free
for the taking, you know?

99
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:42,052
Well, it always has been.

100
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:44,446
Well, we could harvest it
ourselves then, couldn't we?

101
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:50,444
Mr. Lockhart, you were lucky to get
this far without Indian trouble.

102
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:54,407
If I were you, I'd head back to
Laramie while the trail's still clear.

103
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:57,493
Yeah, guess you're
right about that.

104
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:02,373
- Good night, Mr. Lockhart.
- Good night, Miss Waggoman.

105
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,010
- Uh, Miss Waggoman?
- Yes?

106
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:12,057
Uh, that shipment I delivered to
you... Is everything all right?

107
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:16,182
- Yes, everything was there.
- Uh-huh.

108
00:12:16,261 --> 00:12:18,889
Well, I just wanted to make sure.

109
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:24,273
- Good night again, Mr. Lockhart.
- Good night.

110
00:12:24,352 --> 00:12:26,275

Do we fort up or run?

113
00:13:08,313 --> 00:13:11,988
Ah, just keep diggin' salt.

114
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:15,696
If they're from town,
they're not Apaches.

115
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:54,901
Who's running this
bunch of thieves?

116
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:56,914
These men work for me,
if that's what you mean.

117
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,956
- What's your name?
- Will Lockhart. What's your name?

118
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,993
That's the only introduction
you need, mister.

119
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:03,693
That's mighty fancy.
What's it mean?

120
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:06,622
It means we're Barb riders.
That's Barb salt you're stealing.

121
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:10,922
- I was told this salt's free for the taking.
- It ain't, not to strangers.

122
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,254
Looks like I was told wrong. If
there's any charge, I'll pay for it.

123
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,260
You can't buy your way out of this.

124
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,159
It's only salt the stranger has taken.
It'd be different if it was cattle.

125
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:22,600
If we don't teach him a lesson now, how
do we know what he'd steal next time?

126
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:26,104
Any man says I'd rustle
cattle is a liar.

127
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:30,153
No need for that, Charley. And no
need for your gun either, mister.

you can use that rope.

don't need mules.

get back to the ranch!

Please.

00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:50,418
You turn up around here again, you
won't need mules to carry away!

No, I figure this place owes me
something, and I'm gonna make it pay.

Let me straighten you out, mister.

We got enough trouble around here
with the Apaches and young Dave.

Now, don't you go startin' any.

Well, that's what I owe you, boys, with a
little extra, to get you back to Laramie.

Good luck to you.

- Ain't that where you come from?

I come from Laramie. I didn't
say anything about a fort.

I figured you were an army man.

No, I'm headin' back to town.

178

I like workin' for you, Mr. Lockhart.
I sort of hate to leave you.

179
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,405
Well, maybe this won't be
the kind of work you like.

I've got a personal stake in finding
this man, Charley. What's yours?

183
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:24,966
I've always been a nosy man.

184
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:29,017
While you're going into town, maybe I'll
head up north and poke my big nose around.

185
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:31,014
Up north? That's
Apache land up there.

186
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:34,063
In my case, that's not so
dangerous. My mother was one.

187

I've got a lot of

201
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:16,499
Well, I had a little mix-up with
some gentlemen from the Barb Ranch.

202
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:19,620
- They accused me of trespassing.
- Trespassing?

203
00:20:19,702 --> 00:20:22,706
Just who does own those
salt lagoons, anyway?

204
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,756
I suppose they are
part of the Barb,

205
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:26,787
but nobody's ever made
a point of it before.

206
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:30,050
Uh-huh. Well, they sure made
a point of it this afternoon.

207
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:33,508
They burned my wagons
and shot my mules.

208
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:35,810
They seemed to know exactly
where to find me too.

209
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:38,319
There's no reason you should
blame me for what happened.

210
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:39,710
I warned you about the lagoons.

211
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:42,893
You warned me about the Apache.
You didn't mention the Barb.

212
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:48,277
The fellow that seemed to cause
most of the trouble was named Dave.

213
00:20:48,397 --> 00:20:51,367
- Do you happen to know him?
- He's my cousin.

Your cousin?

215

Alec Waggoman's the man.

Well, I think I've got
to meet that man.

at you makes me feel easier.

he made my father.

what can you, a stranger, expect?

302
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:53,049
Your father was an
easy man. I'm not.

303
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,305
No one's breaking his word with me.

304
00:28:55,384 --> 00:28:59,222
This is no place for us, Vic. I want to
leave, and I want you to leave with me.

305
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:00,088
Where can we go?

306
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,683
- Anywhere.
- That's the same as nowhere.

307
00:29:02,766 --> 00:29:05,144
Look, Barbara, we've been
all over this before.

308
00:29:05,227 --> 00:29:07,355
Here in Coronado we got something.

309
00:29:07,437 --> 00:29:09,986
Anywhere else we go, we're...
we're just a couple of nobodies.

310
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:12,443
You keep saying we've got
nothing if we leave.

311
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:15,200
If we have each other,
doesn't that mean anything?

312
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,828
I love you, Barbara. You know that.

313
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:20,750
But I worked my whole
life for the Barb.

314
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:22,999
I got years of sweat and
blood soaked in that ground,

315
00:29:23,078 --> 00:29:25,001
and I'm not giving up
what's rightfully mine.

316
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,174
I know my uncle and
I know my cousin,

317
00:29:27,249 --> 00:29:29,877
and neither one of them will give up
a foot of ground without a fight.

318
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,883
I don't want to see you hurt, Vic.

319
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,816
You're the only one that
can hurt me, Barbara.

320
00:29:33,842 --> 00:29:37,237
I want to be your wife, Vic, but if
I can't get you to leave with me,

321
00:29:37,263 --> 00:29:39,287
I'm not gonna stay around
to become your widow.

322
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:42,689
(CHUCKLES) I don't die so quick.

323
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,320
Well, Lockhart, what do you
think of the Half Moon?

324
00:29:48,437 --> 00:29:50,360
- What am I supposed to think?
- (CHUCKLES)

325
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:52,783
It'll go a lot smoother
when you take over.

326
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,485
I'm hiring you to be
the new foreman.

327
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:57,538
Oh, well, sounds fine, ma'am,
but I'm not looking for a job.

328
00:29:57,613 --> 00:29:59,286
Now, you've made
enemies of the Barb.

329
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,413
You can't stay around here and
stand up to them all on your own.

330
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:04,540
Barb been giving you
trouble, too, huh?

331
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,543
Trouble? (SCOFFS)

332
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:09,000
Twenty-eight years I've been
battling Alec Waggoman,

333
00:30:09,082 --> 00:30:11,882
to keep him from swallowing up the
Half Moon the way he swallowed up...

334
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,170
every other decent piece of
grazing land in the neighborhood.

335
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:16,344
But I'm gettin' to the point
where I need some help.

336
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:19,723
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Canaday,
but I'm... I'm not the man for you.

337
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:22,304
You ain't afraid of the Barb.
You proved that this afternoon.

338
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,640
No, but I've got no quarrel
with the Waggomans now.

339
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:27,226
They agreed to pay me for
my mules, my wagons...

340
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:29,269
Just gonna take the money
and let 'em run you out?

341
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:31,439
No, but I wouldn't be any
good for you, ma'am.

342
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,659
- I'm no cowhand.
- Well, you're no mule skinner either.

343
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,328
I can tell that from the
look of your hands.

344
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,405
Just what <i>are</i> you
doin' here, Lockhart?

345
00:30:40,489 --> 00:30:46,212
Well, you might say on account of some
good wagons of mine that got burned,

346
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:50,416
or you might blame it on a rope
that dragged me through a fire.

347
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:53,218
But you'd be closer if you
asked me about my brother.

348
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:57,298
He was just a kid. We...

349
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:01,309
I can't realize yet he's dead.

350
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,430
- Wanna talk about it?
- No.

351
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:07,642
No, I've thought about it too much to
talk. I'm gonna do something about it.

352
00:31:07,724 --> 00:31:11,445
So you're here to hunt
a man and kill him.

353
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:17,110
I was wonderin' if... Could you let
me have one of your saddle ponies?

354
00:31:17,192 --> 00:31:20,446
I'll pay you for it as soon as
I settle with the Waggomans.

355
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,283
Guess I can fix you up.
We'll go down to the corral...

356
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:26,414
after we have a bite of supper.

357
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:29,254
- Maybe you'll reconsider.
- No, the supper sounds fine.

358
00:32:21,423 --> 00:32:23,846
Oh. Do we fight or talk?

359
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:28,647
We gotta finish that fight someday.
I don't know whether I won or lost.

360
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:32,644
- Well, we'll call it a draw?
- I'll settle for that.

361
00:32:32,726 --> 00:32:35,730
Come on in. The old
man's expecting you.

362
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:49,160
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

363
00:32:49,242 --> 00:32:53,793
Wagons like yours cost about $75
a piece. Good mule costs 20.

364
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:56,998
That means the Barb owes you
around $600. I'll make it six.

365
00:32:57,024 --> 00:32:58,861
That's a little more
than I paid for 'em.

366
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,304
- Well, I'm satisfied if you are.
- I'm satisfied.

367
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,553
Sit down.

368
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:07,637
You worry me, Lockhart, and I'm not easily
worried. What do you want from me?

369
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,347
Well, if you've got nothing to hide,
you've got nothing to worry about.

370
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,057
This is new country, hard country.

371
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,314
I've had to make some hard decisions, but
I've never done anything I was ashamed of.

372
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:19,194
You don't seem to have much
trouble with the Apache, do you?

373
00:33:19,272 --> 00:33:22,116
I respect 'em. They
were here first.

374
00:33:22,192 --> 00:33:25,446
Whatever I got from 'em I
bought. I didn't just take it.

375
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:29,124
About six months ago they massacred
a cavalry patrol on your land.

376
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,951
What'd you do about that?

377
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:35,581
Nothing. They have a right to hunt all
over my land. That was part of our deal.

378
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:40,594
They shot down 12 men on a routine
patrol. Was that part of the deal too?

379
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:43,388
I don't know who fired
the first shot. Do you?

380
00:33:43,463 --> 00:33:47,058
I know the United States Cavalry.

381
00:33:47,134 --> 00:33:49,387
What's all this got to do
between you and me?

382
00:33:49,469 --> 00:33:51,016
Everything.

383
00:33:52,556 --> 00:33:55,059
I want to be friends
with you, Lockhart.

384
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:57,561
- I don't <i>have</i> to be, I <i>want</i> to be.
- Why?

385
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,271
Well, I'd like you to work for me.

386
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:00,981
(SCOFFS)

387
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,318
Ah, we don't speak
the same language.

388
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:07,075
Well, maybe we could
both bend a little.

389
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:11,455
I've never owned an acre
of land. Never wanted to.

390
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:15,788
You couldn't live with an acre less than
you've got. Now, just where do we bend?

391
00:34:15,871 --> 00:34:17,999
I'm not trying to buy your
friendship, Lockhart.

392
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:20,709
I'm just looking for a way to
reach it. Now, how do I do that?

393
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:24,296
Why am I so important to you?
I don't know you, you don't know me.

394
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:28,759
I don't know you, but I
knew you were coming.

395
00:34:28,884 --> 00:34:32,184
- What?
- I was expecting you.

396
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:37,522
Well, I'm afraid you'll
have to explain that.

397
00:34:39,436 --> 00:34:42,064
Nah, you wouldn't understand.
I'll get you your money.

398
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,613
Oh, Vic, come in here.

399
00:34:46,902 --> 00:34:49,655
- Yes, Mr. Waggoman?
- Get me $600.

400
00:34:49,738 --> 00:34:52,207
Cash is all in the safe.
You put it there yourself.

401
00:34:52,282 --> 00:34:54,455
I forgot that. I'll get it.

402
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,959
Well, it's quite an
outfit you've got here.

403
00:34:57,985 --> 00:35:01,087
Biggest in the territory. Be
bigger yet one of these days.

404
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:03,965
LOCKHART: Doesn't seem like
there's much spreading room left.

405
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:06,012
VIC:
Oh, there's always room, Lockhart.

406
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:09,432
A ranch that stops growing
might just as well be dead.

407
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,761
LOCKHART: Some places
get so big they just bust.

408
00:35:22,604 --> 00:35:24,698
Here we are.

409
00:35:26,775 --> 00:35:28,743
Fifty, 100, 150...

410
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:31,345
Hey, you better watch what you're doing,
Mr. Waggoman. Those aren't fifties...

411
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:34,895
- ...they're hundreds.
- Oh. Here.

412
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,794
- Give him $600.
- Yeah, sure.

413
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:41,632
- There you are.
- Thank you.

414
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:44,877
- Well, we're all settled up.
- Not quite.

415
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:46,955
There's nothing to keep
you here now, is there?

416
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:48,405
That a reason for me to leave?

417
00:35:48,463 --> 00:35:51,512
I know my son's never been whipped
before. He's not gonna like it.

418
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:54,686
Well, nobody likes being whipped.
Most men get over it.

419
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:58,891
Look, Lockhart, this is a big country.
There are plenty of towns around.

420
00:35:58,974 --> 00:36:02,524
Now, why don't you be a good fella and
pick some other place to roost, huh?

421
00:36:02,602 --> 00:36:05,401
Hmm. I'll think it over.

422
00:36:07,941 --> 00:36:10,569

423
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:25,751
(CHICKENS CLUCKING)

424
00:36:25,834 --> 00:36:28,087
That $600 comes out
of your pay, Vic.

425
00:36:28,169 --> 00:36:30,763
<i>My</i> pay? What are you talking about?

426
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,682
It was Dave who burned
them wagons, not me.

427
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,350
You should have been
there to stop him.

428
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:37,627
I've got thousands of head of cattle to
look over. I can't be everywhere at once.

429
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,187
You got it all wrong, Alec.

430
00:36:39,213 --> 00:36:42,005
Maybe I've had it all
wrong for a long time.

431
00:36:42,058 --> 00:36:45,688
When Dave's ma died, I figured
the boy needed a tight rein.

432
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,364
And I thought he'd take it better
from you than he would from me.

433
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,818
But what he don't need is someone
to get him into more scrapes.

434
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,619
Alec, I swear to you, I tried
to stop him out at the lagoons.

435
00:36:53,695 --> 00:36:56,448
Next time there's a mix-up like
that, you'd better stop him,

436
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:58,750
or I'll bust you to a cowhand.

437
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:01,169
Better yet, I'll fire you.

438
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,254
- What's that?
- You heard.

439
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:04,590
Say it again.

440
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:07,993
I said next time Dave gets in a
mess like that, you're fired.

441
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:11,172
No one's firing me off
this ranch, Alec. No one.

442
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:13,598
I belong here as much as
you, and more than Dave.

443
00:37:13,673 --> 00:37:16,847
You're wrong again, Vic.
I like you. I've always liked you.

444
00:37:16,926 --> 00:37:20,726
But Dave's my blood. Him I love.
And likin' and lovin' ain't the same.

445
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,184
You made me a promise. I get a
share of this ranch with Dave.

446
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:27,563
- And I'm holding you to it!
- You got nothing in your name,

447
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:29,648
not even the saddle on
the horse you ride.

448
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:31,984
How are you gonna hold me
to it if I change my mind?

449
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:35,578
- How?
- You wanna find out, Alec?

450
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:38,749
Fire me. Go ahead, fire me.

451
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:43,162
Looking at you, I see
myself 20 years ago.

452
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,667
I don't want to fight
you, boy. I need you.

453
00:37:45,747 --> 00:37:49,342
But you need me too. Now, let's
both try and remember that.

454
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:55,011
Alec, you oughtn't to push me.
I don't like to be pushed.

455
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,515
I'd push you right off the earth
if I thought it'd help Dave.

456
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:02,689
You're right, he is weak. All the
more reason he needs your help.

457
00:38:02,806 --> 00:38:06,856
Now, keep both eyes on him, Vic. Do
this for me and I'll be beholden to you.

458
00:38:08,978 --> 00:38:11,151
All right, Alec.

459
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:13,905
But don't ever push me again.

460
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:00,663
Hi, Charley.
(BLUSTERS)

461
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:04,835
Well, you didn't spend very much
time up in Apache land, did you?

462
00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:10,291
My mother's relatives wasn't
anxious for me to stay on.

463
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:13,752
When I was a boy, my pa told me...

464
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:17,305
that I was lucky to have an
Irish pa and an Indian ma.

465
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,429
Said I'd have two
places to come home to.

466
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:22,602
Don't seem like I have any.

467
00:39:22,677 --> 00:39:27,649
Well, about the only home I
remember is an army barracks.

468
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:29,818
Give me a little of that, will ya?

469
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:32,487
I guess we're just
not the homey type.

470
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:35,566
Why don't you go back
to Laramie, Captain?

471
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,619
- What do you mean, "Captain"?
- You talk like one.

472
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:41,992
I used to be a scout
in the Cavalry.

473
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:45,575
Got so I could fix a man's
rank by the tone of his voice.

474
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,368
- Why are you tryin' to get rid of me?
- 'Cause there's trouble comin',

475
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,292
and you can't handle
it by yourself.

476
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:52,794
Well, suppose you just tell
me what you found out.

477
00:39:52,874 --> 00:39:54,797
Sure.

478
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:57,629
If you're lookin' for the repeatin'
rifles, you've come to the right place.

479
00:39:57,712 --> 00:40:00,511
Some of the young bucks are
sportin' 'em. They expect a lot more.

480
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:03,260
- Couple of hundred more.
- When? Who from?

481
00:40:03,343 --> 00:40:05,345
I didn't press the point.

482
00:40:05,428 --> 00:40:08,102
If I'd gotten too nosy, I wouldn't
have been able to ride out.

483
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:11,151
But they got a contact.
Somebody's supplyin' 'em.

484
00:40:11,226 --> 00:40:13,854
There wasn't any guns in that
load of freight we hauled.

485
00:40:13,937 --> 00:40:15,735
Won't be any more
wagons in for a month.

486
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,532
Wonder where that
shipment's coming from.

487
00:40:17,607 --> 00:40:21,282
All I know is they're excited, like
they're expecting them guns soon,

488
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:22,954
in a couple of days at most.

489
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:26,158
- What makes you think that?
- Because they already paid for them.

490
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:29,245
And nobody takes pay from the
Apaches without deliverin'.

491
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,705
Those guns might be here already.

492
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:34,507
Sounds more like it.
Yeah, but where?

493
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:37,210
They'd be pretty hard to hide.

494
00:40:38,419 --> 00:40:42,799
- You expecting to meet someone?
- No.

495
00:40:42,882 --> 00:40:45,726
Somebody's following you,
but he's keeping out of sight.

496
00:40:45,802 --> 00:40:49,102
Yeah. I thought I saw
the sun reflecting...

497
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,649
against a gun or a pair
of spurs or something.

498
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:54,861
- Better let me ride with you.
- No, you go back into town.

499
00:40:54,978 --> 00:40:56,946
- I'll see you later.
- Whatever you say, Captain.

500
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:30,768
Hold it, mister!

501
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:33,017
- All right, speak your piece.
- Wasn't doing nothing.

502
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:34,882
You've been followin' me
ever since I left the Barb.

503
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:36,773
But I didn't mean no
harm. I ain't got a gun.

504
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:40,025
Come on, come on, this hot sun makes
a fella impatient. Hurry up. Come on.

505
00:41:40,051 --> 00:41:42,888
I'm... I'm... I'm just trying
to make an honest dollar.

506
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:44,865
See, not holding down a steady job,

507
00:41:44,944 --> 00:41:49,074
why, I got lots of time to pick up
bits of news here and there, you know?

508
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:52,661
And... well, I guess I know everything
private that goes on in Coronado.

509
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:55,748
- What's that got to do with me?
- Well, you...

510
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,950
you strike me as a man that's
lookin' for somethin'...

511
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:59,922
and willing to pay for it.

512
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:04,097
Uh-huh. Well, that depends on what
the information is, who's selling it.

513
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:08,723
Well, I ain't got no references,
but anybody can tell you...

514
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:12,101
that Chris Boldt is a
man not to be trusted.

515
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,353
That means nobody's secrets
are sacred with me.

516
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:18,482
Uh-huh. Just who you
figurin' on sellin' out?

517
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:20,484
You just name 'em.

518
00:42:20,563 --> 00:42:23,282
It wouldn't be me, would it?

519
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,079
Come on, who put you on my trail?
Who are you working for, Boldt?

520
00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:31,624
- Myself.
- You're lyin'. Come on, try again.

521
00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:36,246
Well, I can see we ain't gonna
do no business, Mr. Lockhart,

522
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:39,549
so if you'll just lower that
gun, I'll get on my way.

523
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:43,299
Go on, go on. Go ahead. Hey!

524
00:42:43,378 --> 00:42:47,884
Don't you ever come up
ridin' behind me again, huh?

525
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:04,365
- Lockhart?
- Yeah?

526
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:05,570
I'm Sheriff Tom Quigby.

527
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:08,102
Oh, pleased to make your
acquaintance, Sheriff.

528
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:11,281
I handle the law here in Coronado.
I like things peaceful.

529
00:43:11,406 --> 00:43:12,958
Seems peaceful to me.

530
00:43:12,984 --> 00:43:15,902
It sure ain't, mister. Not
since you breezed in.

531
00:43:15,952 --> 00:43:18,876
I heard about your fight
with Dave Waggoman.

532
00:43:18,955 --> 00:43:21,583
You know, Dave's the kind of
a lad that'll hold a grudge.

533
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:24,510
You two meet up again, and
likely as not there'll be a killin'.

534
00:43:24,585 --> 00:43:26,963
Uh-huh. Well, that's up to Dave.

535
00:43:27,046 --> 00:43:29,674
It's up to me to see
that it don't happen.

536
00:43:29,757 --> 00:43:31,759
So I'm suggesting
that you leave town.

537
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,500
Well, why don't you
take it up with Dave?

538
00:43:33,526 --> 00:43:35,714
It was him that started
it at the salt flat.

539
00:43:35,763 --> 00:43:37,731
Or do you take orders
from the Barb?

540
00:43:37,807 --> 00:43:39,730
Wait, I don't take any
orders from anyone.

541
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:42,608
Yeah. If you'll excuse me,
I want to bed down my horse.

542
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,360
- Thanks for the knife.
- Anytime.

543
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:47,905
It's your neck, Lockhart. If
you want a Christian funeral,

544
00:43:47,984 --> 00:43:50,954
better leave some money
with the undertaker.

545
00:43:56,451 --> 00:44:00,797
- (BELL RINGING)
- (CHATTERING)

546
00:45:05,561 --> 00:45:08,030
(PANTING)

547
00:45:28,376 --> 00:45:31,505
(INDIAN DRUMS)

548
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,008
(FLUTE)

549
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:53,075
Good evening, Miss Waggoman.

550
00:45:53,151 --> 00:45:55,279
Good evening, Mr. Lockhart.

551
00:45:55,403 --> 00:45:58,703
- Padre, this is Mr. Lockhart.
- Padre.

552
00:45:58,781 --> 00:46:01,534
Well, is this a
private celebration?

553
00:46:01,617 --> 00:46:04,621
(CHUCKLES) No. Everyone
is welcome at a wedding.

554
00:46:04,745 --> 00:46:06,647
He brought the supplies
in from Laramie.

555
00:46:06,673 --> 00:46:10,690
Oh. It's a good thing you got here.
I was running out of candles.

556
00:46:10,716 --> 00:46:12,100
(CHUCKLES)

557
00:46:12,253 --> 00:46:15,427
Well, these Pueblos are a lot different
from the Apache, aren't they?

558
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:19,431
The Pueblos were cliff dwellers. They
have lived in peace for centuries.

559
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,356
The Apaches are hunters and warriors.
They have never been anything else.

560
00:46:23,431 --> 00:46:26,275
Speaking of the Apache, do you
happen to know anything...

561
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,571
about the massacre of a cavalry patrol
at Dutch Creek several months ago?

562
00:46:30,646 --> 00:46:35,072
Only what I heard... That it was an
unprovoked and ruthless killing.

563
00:46:35,151 --> 00:46:38,246
Did you know that the Apache
used repeating rifles?

564
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:39,948
There was some talk about that.

565
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:43,001
Was there any talk about
where the rifles came from?

566
00:46:43,117 --> 00:46:45,873
Some men will sell
anything for a profit.

567
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:50,466
Uh-huh. I suppose there's a man
like that in every town, huh?

568
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:53,302
- Padre.
- Excuse me.

569
00:46:56,297 --> 00:46:58,720
I heard my uncle paid you
for your mules and wagons.

570
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:00,893
That he did. He did.

571
00:47:00,968 --> 00:47:02,936
Then I guess you'll
be leaving soon.

572
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:05,765
No, I think I'll stick
around for a while.

573
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:08,647
Maybe you could invite
me up to tea again, huh?

574
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:17,864
- Still around, huh, Lockhart?
- Mm-hmm.

575
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:21,285
- You getting used to the idea?
- Looks like I'll have to.

576
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:23,537
I'm sorry I'm late, Barbara.
The old man kept me.

577
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:25,243
Mr. Lockhart was
filling in for you.

578
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:28,330
Never thought you'd find anything like
this in Coronado, did you, Lockhart?

579
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:29,959
Nor anyplace else.

580
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:32,758
Victor, I hope you're not going
to be late for your own wedding.

581
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:36,588
I'm ready right now, Padre.
Even got my wedding suit on.

582
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:38,969
- Think Alec will give you a night off?
- (CHUCKLES)

583
00:47:39,048 --> 00:47:41,096
Well, I better be moving
along. Good night, all.

584
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:43,803
Good night.

585
00:47:56,065 --> 00:47:59,365
- I'll trouble you for your gun, Lockhart.
- Huh?

586
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:01,741
Hand it over.

587
00:48:01,862 --> 00:48:04,285
- What'd I do now?
- You just can't let a day go by...

588
00:48:04,365 --> 00:48:05,912
without pickin' a fight, can ya?

589
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:09,913
- Who's complainin' now, Sheriff?
- Ever hear of a Chris Boldt?

590
00:48:10,037 --> 00:48:12,711
- Yeah, I've heard of him.
- When did you see him last?

591
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,636
About a half hour ago. He came out
of an alley, pulled a knife on me.

592
00:48:16,711 --> 00:48:18,759
He was there. He saw him.

593
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:21,136
I didn't see.

594
00:48:21,257 --> 00:48:24,261
- What's the charge, Sheriff?
- Supposin' you tell me what happened.

595
00:48:24,343 --> 00:48:26,846
I just told you what happened.
The fella pulled a knife on me,

596
00:48:26,929 --> 00:48:29,369
we wrestled around for a little
bit and he ran down the alley.

597
00:48:29,432 --> 00:48:31,480
- That's what happened.
- That's not all, Lockhart.

598
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,274
- Chris Boldt is dead.
- He...

599
00:48:34,395 --> 00:48:37,148
What? I found him at
the end of the alley.

600
00:48:37,231 --> 00:48:40,155
He was knifed to death.

601
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:42,783
Let's go.

602
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:06,511
(APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS)

603
00:49:08,596 --> 00:49:10,815
I want to see him alone, inside.

604
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:21,488
- How'd you get in this mess?
- I thought maybe you were behind it.

605
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:24,821
Should the time come I want to get rid
of you, I won't use any half measures.

606
00:49:24,904 --> 00:49:28,249
You told me you owned the whole
town. Does that include the sheriff?

607
00:49:28,366 --> 00:49:29,392
Quigby's an honest man.

608
00:49:29,418 --> 00:49:32,441
- I never interfere with him.
- I see, I see.

609
00:49:32,495 --> 00:49:35,669
You'll need a lawyer, you'll need a
friendly judge. I've got 'em both.

610
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:38,339
- I'll try and get you out.
- Why are you doing all this?

611
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:40,545
I want you out of Coronado.

612
00:49:40,628 --> 00:49:44,223
Suppose you tell me the real
reason why you're here.

613
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,804
- Well, that's not easy.
- What?

614
00:49:49,929 --> 00:49:52,523
Do you dream much, Lockhart?

615
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,315
- No, no.
- You're a lucky man.

616
00:49:57,853 --> 00:50:00,606
For years now, ever
since Dave's ma died,

617
00:50:00,689 --> 00:50:04,193
I've had the same dream two
or three nights a week.

618
00:50:04,276 --> 00:50:06,745
It's always the same.

619
00:50:06,821 --> 00:50:10,075
A stranger comes into my home.

620
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:14,287
He's tall, lean, like yourself.

621
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,293
Has a voice like yours.

622
00:50:16,372 --> 00:50:20,343
Even walks like you.

623
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:24,173
Well, I don't know
anything about dreams.

624
00:50:26,632 --> 00:50:30,227
He comes with a gun in his hand.

625
00:50:30,302 --> 00:50:33,146
- He comes to kill my boy.
- What?

626
00:50:35,307 --> 00:50:38,277
My Dave.

627
00:50:38,352 --> 00:50:41,572
I know it's only a dream,

628
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:45,117
but I'd rest much easier if you
hadn't have come to Coronado.

629
00:50:45,192 --> 00:50:48,366
Yeah, well, I'd rest much
easier too if I hadn't.

630
00:50:48,446 --> 00:50:51,416
Well, then, take my
offer and go away.

631
00:50:51,532 --> 00:50:54,637
I appreciate the offer, but I
can't accept the conditions.

632
00:50:54,663 --> 00:50:56,313
Why not?

633
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:59,715
You're not gonna find the answer to
your dream around here, Mr. Waggoman.

634
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,464
You better look someplace else.

635
00:51:04,712 --> 00:51:06,885
Tom.

636
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,848
(LOCK OPENING)

637
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:37,211
- Hello, Alec.
- Hello, Kate.

638
00:51:38,537 --> 00:51:40,505
- Alec?
- What is it, Kate?

639
00:51:40,581 --> 00:51:45,587
Oh, I just thought that sometime we'd have
more to say to each other than just hello.

640
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:49,515
- What else is there to say?
- (CHUCKLES)

641
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,558
Nothing, I guess.

642
00:52:00,643 --> 00:52:04,068
- Why did you do it, Lockhart?
- Oh, you, too, huh?

643
00:52:04,146 --> 00:52:07,626
Now, look here. You get into a scrap with a
man, and five minutes later he's found dead.

644
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:10,369
- What am I supposed to think?
- You're supposed to think I killed him.

645
00:52:10,444 --> 00:52:14,745
I came all the way from Laramie to creep
up a dark alley and knife the town drunk.

646
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:17,918
- Now, does that make better sense to you?
- If it did, I wouldn't be here.

647
00:52:17,993 --> 00:52:21,372
- Well, can you get me out of this place?
- That's what I came for.

648
00:52:21,455 --> 00:52:23,503
I got the circuit judge
to give me a writ.

649
00:52:23,582 --> 00:52:26,301
You're released in my custody
till the trial comes up.

650
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:29,098
Well, that's the best offer I've had
today. You're a very fine woman.

651
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:32,846
No, I'm not. The Half Moon needs
a foreman who the Barb respects.

652
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:36,020
You're the only man around
here who fills that bill.

653
00:52:36,095 --> 00:52:38,894
I told you I didn't know anything about
cattle. I wouldn't do you any good.

654
00:52:38,973 --> 00:52:41,692
But you've got cause to
hate the Barb. That'll do me.

655
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:44,567
I've got grief enough of my own without
taking on yours. No, thank you.

656
00:52:44,603 --> 00:52:47,603
Now, look here, Mr. Lockhart. I'll give
you one minute to make up your mind.

657
00:52:47,648 --> 00:52:52,495
Either you'll take my offer, or I'll tear up
this writ and you can rot here in this jail.

658
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,494
(SIGHS)

659
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:08,131
You're just a hard, scheming,
old woman, aren't you?

660
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:12,215
Ugly too. Tom, let this
rooster out of here.

661
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:24,310
You know, these beef tallies
still don't come out right.

662
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:25,653
Here, you add 'em up.

663
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:28,636
I'm not good at paperwork,
Pa. You know that.

664
00:53:28,689 --> 00:53:31,909
Well, no cowman is,
but it's gotta be done.

665
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:39,951
Davey boy, you can't hold onto 100,000
acres by riding horse in a buckskin jacket.

666
00:53:40,034 --> 00:53:43,038
You've got to develop
a head for figures.

667
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,043
Sure, Pa. Sure.

668
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,293
You're not even
listening to me, Son.

669
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:52,676
Oh, sure, I'm listening to you,
Pa. I always listen to you.

670
00:53:52,755 --> 00:53:55,725
Bring your chair over here.

671
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,973
Come on. Right here. Sit down.

672
00:53:59,053 --> 00:54:00,976
(PATS CHAIR)

673
00:54:01,055 --> 00:54:05,811
You know, Davey, you're
just like your mother.

674
00:54:05,893 --> 00:54:09,739
She'd always listen, but
she never understood.

675
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:15,695
I'm gonna try, Pa. I'm gonna try to
be like you want me from now on.

676
00:54:15,778 --> 00:54:18,201
You know it hurts
me to ride you son.

677
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,033
And if I do, it's only
because I love you.

678
00:54:21,116 --> 00:54:24,837
I want to protect you, and
I want to be proud of you.

679
00:54:24,912 --> 00:54:29,258
I just want to be able to stand
on my own feet. Vic won't let me.

680
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:32,337
Now, don't blame Vic. He's
only carrying out my orders.

681
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:36,014
You still need him, boy. Now,
believe me when I tell you that.

682
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,593
I know you mean well, Pa, but...

683
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:43,352
Well, it don't look good. Vic giving
the orders when I should be the one.

684
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,979
You will soon, Son. You will soon.

685
00:54:46,058 --> 00:54:48,686
Just bide your time.

686
00:54:48,769 --> 00:54:51,272
You see...
(APPROACHING HOOF BEATS)

687
00:55:02,783 --> 00:55:05,002
Half Moon hired that
Lockhart fella.

688
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:07,713
- I thought he was in jail.
- Kate got him out on a writ.

689
00:55:07,788 --> 00:55:09,711
You might've expected that.

690
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:13,511
Stranger comes to town, and you boys fix
it so he gets a grudge against the Barb.

691
00:55:13,627 --> 00:55:15,812
Kate's not gonna miss an
opportunity like that.

692
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:18,391
- Come on, Vic.
- Where do you think you're goin'?

693
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:21,039
Kate hired herself a gun.
That's plain enough.

694
00:55:21,065 --> 00:55:23,667
Dave's right, you let her get
away with this, she'll hire more.

695
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:27,942
Nobody asked you. Keep away
from the Half Moon, both of you.

696
00:55:28,016 --> 00:55:30,860
I've never seen you run away from a
fight before. What's got into you?

697
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:34,736
Times have changed. In the old days,
I used to crack down plenty. I had to.

698
00:55:34,815 --> 00:55:35,916
There wasn't much law then.

699
00:55:35,942 --> 00:55:38,265
But it was the only way I could
build the Barb and hold it.

700
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,507
And now you've gone soft, huh?

701
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:43,107
You'll be taking over the
ranch pretty soon, Dave.

702
00:55:43,157 --> 00:55:47,037
Maybe sooner than you think.
You'll need peace and friends.

703
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,089
What do you expect me to do?
Run the Barb with a pencil?

704
00:55:50,164 --> 00:55:52,508
I'm not afraid to try
anything you did!

705
00:55:54,835 --> 00:55:59,466
I hate to tell you this, but
you're not the man I was.

706
00:55:59,548 --> 00:56:02,301
Copy me and you'll meet up
with somebody who'll break ya.

707
00:56:02,384 --> 00:56:05,228
So stop acting like a crazy
colt and get ahold of yourself,

708
00:56:05,304 --> 00:56:08,183
or you won't get a chance
to run this outfit at all!

709
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:12,111
I didn't spend a lifetime building this
thing up for you to fritter it away.

710
00:56:12,186 --> 00:56:14,655
Now go over those beef
tallies like I told you to!

711
00:56:16,148 --> 00:56:18,242
I want to see you, Vic.

712
00:56:29,536 --> 00:56:31,413
Come here, Vic.

713
00:56:32,581 --> 00:56:35,050
Look out there. Tell
me what you see.

714
00:56:36,418 --> 00:56:38,796
(CHUCKLES) Same old mountains.

715
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:40,973
Uh, any snow on 'em yet?

716
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:44,058
What's the matter, Alec?

717
00:56:45,552 --> 00:56:48,271
I'm going blind, that's
what's the matter.

718
00:56:48,347 --> 00:56:52,227
I own 100,000 acres, and I can't
see more than ten of them.

719
00:56:52,351 --> 00:56:54,979
- Have you seen a doctor?
- The best.

720
00:56:55,062 --> 00:56:57,611
That trip I made to Chicago
wasn't to sell beef.

721
00:56:57,689 --> 00:57:01,444
I went to see a specialist. He says I came
too late. There's nothing can be done.

722
00:57:01,527 --> 00:57:04,952
Six months to a year from now I
won't even be able to shave myself.

723
00:57:05,072 --> 00:57:07,166
- Did you tell Dave?
- No, not yet.

724
00:57:07,241 --> 00:57:10,666
I'm telling you first because
I expect more from you.

725
00:57:10,744 --> 00:57:12,838
When they know the
old man can't see,

726
00:57:12,913 --> 00:57:15,712
the wolves will close in on this
place and tear it to pieces.

727
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:18,840
Don't you worry, Alec. Anybody
that crosses our boundaries...

728
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:21,923
will grab only enough
land to bury himself in.

729
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:24,975
Oh, I know you can fight, Vic,

730
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:28,829
but that's not enough alone.
You've got to think.

731
00:57:28,855 --> 00:57:32,466
Even if you can't see, you can
still do the thinkin' for us, Alec.

732
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:36,354
I've been pretty hard on you, Vic.

733
00:57:36,436 --> 00:57:38,939
Maybe harder than you deserve.

734
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,741
Maybe I've been jealous,
because you're not my son too.

735
00:57:44,653 --> 00:57:47,202
Take care of my boy.

736

Take the east trail up
into the high country.

739
00:58:06,592 --> 00:58:09,471
You'll find some of my cattle
mixed in with the Barb herd.

740
00:58:09,553 --> 00:58:12,557
If we don't cut 'em out they'll
end up wearing the Barb brand.

741
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:14,733
Uh-huh. All right, boss.

742
00:58:14,808 --> 00:58:17,186
I'll ride up and have a look.

And, uh, Lockhart?

744
00:58:19,813 --> 00:58:23,738
Keep your eye on the cattle. Don't
knife any more town drunks.

745
00:58:23,817 --> 00:58:25,785
Yes, ma'am.

746
00:58:51,845 --> 00:58:53,768
Gimme the glass.

747
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:04,651
It's Half Moon stock. Come
on, boys. Let's corral 'em.

748
00:59:04,733 --> 00:59:07,236
Now, Dave. Alec said let
things sit for a while.

749
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:08,951
They're grazing on Barb
land, aren't they?

750
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:12,290
So they're eating a mouthful of grass.
We got plenty growin' around here.

751
00:59:12,366 --> 00:59:16,496
Alec always said, "A steer swallows a blade
of Barb grass, it becomes a Barb steer."

752
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,729
Are you tryin' to change that, Vic?

753
00:59:18,755 --> 00:59:21,891
No, Dave. I'm just tryin'
to follow Alec's orders.

754
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:26,238
I heard you talkin' to him in the parlor.
I heard every word you said.

755
00:59:26,264 --> 00:59:29,367
All you're tryin' to do is to make me
look weak to make yourself look strong.

756
00:59:29,424 --> 00:59:31,452
You got the old man believin'
you're a plaster saint.

I'm gonna show the cracks in you.

758
00:59:33,887 --> 00:59:36,936
You all finished, Dave?

759
00:59:37,015 --> 00:59:39,689
I'm finished talkin',
but I'm not finished.

760
00:59:39,768 --> 00:59:42,772
Until Alec changes things,
I'm tellin' the boys what to do.

761
00:59:42,854 --> 00:59:45,357
I'm tellin' 'em, Dave, not you.

762
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,070
Go on. Tell them. You're not gonna
give 'em the orders much longer.

763
00:59:51,947 --> 00:59:55,577
It won't take all of us to corral a few
head of steers. Ned and I can handle 'em.

764
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:58,913
You and the rest of the boys
can take care of our stock.

765
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:00,919

Gimme his gun. Give it to me!

didn't turn out to be like him.

you see him do it?

bunkhouse, all of ya!

885
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:37,392
There now.

886
01:15:37,418 --> 01:15:39,920
I don't know what I would've
done without you, Miss Canaday..

887
01:15:39,977 --> 01:15:42,321
I'll fix us some breakfast.
Bacon and eggs do?

888
01:15:42,438 --> 01:15:44,657
- Yeah. Fry 'em hard.
- Army style, huh?

889
01:15:44,732 --> 01:15:49,454
Yeah. Well, the army's a pretty good place
for a fella that's alone. I kinda miss it.

890
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:52,574
- Why did you ever leave it then?
- (KNOCKING)

891
01:15:52,657 --> 01:15:54,580
I'll get it.

892
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,335
- Good morning, Sheriff.
- Morning. Morning, Kate.

893
01:16:00,414 --> 01:16:03,759
Come on in, Tom.
What's the trouble?

894
01:16:03,834 --> 01:16:06,838
Dave Waggoman's dead.

895
01:16:06,963 --> 01:16:07,826
How'd it happen?

896
01:16:07,852 --> 01:16:11,812
That's why I'm here... to try and find
out. I heard what Dave did to you.

897
01:16:11,838 --> 01:16:14,704
Maybe you had good cause.
I don't know. But killin' is killin'.

898
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:17,895
I didn't kill him, Sheriff. He headed
for town. I came right here.

899
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:19,459
His own men will tell you that.

900
01:16:19,558 --> 01:16:21,412
You could've doubled back,
met him along the trail.

901
01:16:21,438 --> 01:16:23,358
- I didn't kill him.
- I don't believe you did...

902
01:16:23,384 --> 01:16:26,261
but the men at the Barb think
different. I just came from there.

903
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,989
Vic's tryin' to hold 'em down. How
long he can do it, I don't know.

904
01:16:29,068 --> 01:16:30,536
How's Alec takin' it?

905
01:16:30,611 --> 01:16:34,286
He just sits there in the
parlor, staring at Dave's body.

906
01:16:38,494 --> 01:16:40,339
When the old man comes
out of his shock,

907
01:16:40,365 --> 01:16:42,524
I wouldn't give a plugged
nickel for your life.

908
01:16:42,581 --> 01:16:46,506
Well, I'm not runnin' away
from somethin' I didn't do.

909
01:16:46,585 --> 01:16:50,180
I rode all the way out here just to
warn ya. I guess the rest is up to you.

910
01:16:50,256 --> 01:16:54,306
All right. You tell Alec Waggoman I'll
be right here if he wants to see me.

911
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:38,979
(HORSES BLUSTERING)

912
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:17,013
KATE:
I feel real sorry about Dave, Alec.

913
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:31,403
- I'm goin' with you, Alec.
- It was my son he killed.

914
01:18:31,524 --> 01:18:34,903
- You're no match for Lockhart.
- I've gotta do this thing alone.

915
01:18:34,985 --> 01:18:37,488
I don't want anybody followin' me.

916
01:18:37,571 --> 01:18:39,869
Now, stay in town, all of ya.

917
01:18:57,049 --> 01:18:59,347

You think I killed your boy?
Go ahead. Even the score.

924
01:19:42,094 --> 01:19:44,392
You came here to kill, didn't you?

925
01:19:44,471 --> 01:19:48,692
There's just one man I have reason
to kill, and I haven't found him yet.

926
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:53,523
Take your gun. You'll need
it the next time I see ya.

927
01:19:55,107 --> 01:19:58,953
You've got to believe
me. I didn't do it.

928
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:01,622
I'm not the man in your
dream, Mr. Waggoman.

929
01:20:40,110 --> 01:20:42,033
Sit down, Vic.

930
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,592
You shouldn't be doin' book
work with your eyes, Alec.

931
01:20:48,618 --> 01:20:50,131
Sit down.

932
01:20:50,788 --> 01:20:54,383
I just finished going over
bills for the past six months.

933
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:58,838
I found where we ordered a wagonload
of fence wire from New Orleans.

934
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:01,595
Since when do we use fence wire?

935
01:21:01,674 --> 01:21:06,054
We paid for a wagonload we didn't get.
That's too much money for fence wire.

936
01:21:06,136 --> 01:21:10,516
Too much. There was somethin'
else in that wagon.

937
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:13,318
(SCOFFS)
You askin' or tellin' me, Alec?

938
01:21:13,394 --> 01:21:16,489
I just want the truth. You don't
have to defend Dave any longer.

939
01:21:16,563 --> 01:21:18,657
I just want to know.

940
01:21:18,732 --> 01:21:21,611
Wagonload of supplies
is quite an item.

941
01:21:21,694 --> 01:21:24,743
Why didn't you ever
tell me it was missing?

942
01:21:24,822 --> 01:21:28,326
How could I? What could I say?
"Your son is a thief"?

943
01:21:28,409 --> 01:21:32,334
We're alone in this room, Vic. We
don't have to hide our feelings.

944
01:21:32,413 --> 01:21:36,543
If you think Dave was selling guns
to the Apache, I want to know it.

945
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:40,971
Dave was wild, yes, but he
wouldn't do a thing like that.

946
01:21:41,046 --> 01:21:43,014
No, no. Not that.

947
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:47,644
Well, say somethin'!

948
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:51,315
Well, if you want me to agree
with you, I'll agree with you.

949
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:54,610
I've gotta know for sure.
Now, this I've got to know.

950
01:21:54,727 --> 01:21:57,446
- We're gonna find that wagon.
- Forget about it.

951
01:21:57,521 --> 01:22:01,276
How can I? All I've got left to
hang onto are a few memories.

952
01:22:01,358 --> 01:22:03,952
If Dave was selling guns to the
Apaches, I don't even have that.

953
01:22:04,028 --> 01:22:06,531
Nobody said there were guns in that
wagon! Stop thinkin' there were!

954
01:22:06,613 --> 01:22:10,117
I can't live with a lie! I've got
to know one way or the other.

955
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:13,374
There's not so many places they
can hide a wagon in this country.

956
01:22:13,454 --> 01:22:15,377
We'll find it.

957
01:22:15,456 --> 01:22:18,835
Now, supposin' we find that wagon.
Supposin' there are guns in it.

958
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:21,261
Will that make you feel any better?

959
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:26,059
Yes. 'Cause then I'll know the
man I buried was not my son,

960
01:22:26,133 --> 01:22:28,101
just a stranger.

961
01:23:06,006 --> 01:23:09,806
Well, looks like you've been
sittin' there for two weeks.

962
01:23:09,885 --> 01:23:13,765
Yeah. I just ate a pound of
dust with this can of beans.

963
01:23:13,847 --> 01:23:16,316
Hear you got yourself in
a real box this time.

964
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:19,942
Yeah. Someone sure is doin'
a fine job of messin' me up.

965
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:23,399
- Did you decide to go back to Laramie?
- Still tryin' to get rid of me?

966
01:23:23,482 --> 01:23:27,077
No, sir. This is just one
more reason for me stayin'.

967
01:23:27,152 --> 01:23:30,247
- Found some wagon tracks.
- Where?

968
01:23:30,322 --> 01:23:33,417
Right along this break here,
due south of them mountains.

969
01:23:33,492 --> 01:23:37,463
A peculiar thing, though.
Only found one single track.

970
01:23:37,538 --> 01:23:39,666
One and only one wagon got through.

971
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:42,171
Where were they headed?
Into Apache land?

972
01:23:42,251 --> 01:23:44,049
Didn't seem like they
were headin' nowhere.

973
01:23:44,169 --> 01:23:46,272
I lost the trail right at the
foot of them mountains.

974
01:23:46,298 --> 01:23:49,150
Yeah. Let's see if
we can pick it up.

975
01:24:11,071 --> 01:24:15,918
Well, you couldn't hide a stray dog down
there, let alone a wagon, even from my eyes.

976
01:24:16,034 --> 01:24:19,459
- Must be up above somewhere.
- How could a wagon get up there?

977
01:24:19,538 --> 01:24:21,961
There'd have to be a trail and
it'd have to be plenty wide.

978
01:24:22,082 --> 01:24:24,517
I know every foot of these
rocks. We'll find it.

979
01:24:24,543 --> 01:24:26,797
Let's go back, Alec. We're
not doin' any good here.

980
01:24:26,823 --> 01:24:29,494
Even if the wagon's there, you
know you don't want to find it.

981
01:24:29,548 --> 01:24:33,724
You can go back if you want
to, Vic. I'll find it myself.

982
01:25:02,789 --> 01:25:04,757
Alec!

983
01:25:06,084 --> 01:25:08,712
- Huh?
- Don't go any further.

984
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:11,636
- What is it you don't want me to find?
- I lied to you.

985
01:25:11,757 --> 01:25:15,261
- I didn't find Dave's body on the trail.
- Why would you lie about that?

986
01:25:15,344 --> 01:25:18,063
Because I found him near the guns
and I didn't want you to find out!

987
01:25:18,138 --> 01:25:21,688
When a man starts lying he can't stop.
What else you hiding? What else?

988
01:25:21,767 --> 01:25:24,020
Alec, I want you to listen to me.

989
01:25:24,102 --> 01:25:27,231
My whole life I worked and
sweat and bled for you.

990
01:25:27,314 --> 01:25:29,863
I was the only son you ever
had, but you couldn't see me.

991
01:25:29,942 --> 01:25:32,365
Half the time you never
even knew I was there!

992
01:25:32,444 --> 01:25:35,698
I loved you like only a boy
who never had a father could.

993
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:38,660
So I'm asking you once
more, now, don't go!

994
01:25:38,742 --> 01:25:40,961
I'm gonna see what's
on that plateau.

995
01:25:41,078 --> 01:25:43,547
- Listen to me, you old fool!
- Take your hands off me!

996
01:25:43,664 --> 01:25:45,712
- I tell ya, don't go!
- Let go!

997
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:48,465
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:25:54,758 --> 01:25:56,977
(DISTANT THUDDING)

999
01:26:14,653 --> 01:26:18,157
That wagon must've been loaded real
heavy. Look how deep those tracks are.

1000
01:26:20,576 --> 01:26:22,999
CHARLEY: This is where it ends,
right here in the creek.

1001
01:26:23,078 --> 01:26:25,001
Yeah.

1002
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:28,209
All right, Charley, you go downstream
there. I'll go up the draw here.

1003
01:27:25,307 --> 01:27:27,230
(GUNSHOTS)

1004
01:27:55,962 --> 01:27:59,091
- How is he?
- Still unconscious.

1005
01:27:59,174 --> 01:28:02,974
Don't keep anything from us,
Doctor. We want to know.

1006
01:28:03,053 --> 01:28:07,024
Well, Alec's strong. He's got a
fair chance to pull through, but...

1007
01:28:07,099 --> 01:28:10,103
Finish what you started to say.

1008
01:28:10,185 --> 01:28:13,029
He's blind. Oh, it's no surprise.

1009
01:28:13,105 --> 01:28:17,451
Sight had been failing for years.
The fall just hurried it up, that's all.

1010
01:28:18,777 --> 01:28:21,747
I'm real curious to find
out who pushed him.

1011
01:28:21,863 --> 01:28:24,116
- Pushed him?
- You don't think he fell.

1012
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:26,827
With his eyes, he had
no business on a horse.

1013
01:28:26,910 --> 01:28:29,629
There's nothing wrong
with his horse's eyesight.

1014
01:28:31,289 --> 01:28:35,161
Somebody pushed him, all right. The same
one who killed Dave and Chris Boldt.

1015
01:28:35,187 --> 01:28:36,412
Who?

1016
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:39,389
I'm afraid Alec's the only
one who can tell us that.

1017
01:28:39,464 --> 01:28:42,013
I have another call to make.

1018
01:28:42,092 --> 01:28:44,345
Sit with him until I get back.

1019
01:28:53,395 --> 01:28:56,899
- You already know who it is, don't you?
- What makes you say that?

1020
01:28:56,982 --> 01:28:59,155
If you do, I want you to tell me.

1021
01:28:59,234 --> 01:29:02,659
If I knew I wouldn't be
waiting for Alec to come to.

1022
01:29:06,408 --> 01:29:08,877
- What are you afraid of?
- Why should I be afraid?

1023
01:29:08,952 --> 01:29:11,796
I don't know.

1024
01:29:14,166 --> 01:29:16,385
I don't know, but you are.

1025
01:29:16,501 --> 01:29:18,718
I knew it would come
to this. It just had to.

1026
01:29:18,744 --> 01:29:22,383
No, it didn't have to.
Somebody made it happen.

1027
01:29:22,466 --> 01:29:24,969
When my father was dying,
he told me to leave.

1028
01:29:25,051 --> 01:29:29,147
He said everything here was built on greed
and killing, and it would go on that way.

1029
01:29:29,222 --> 01:29:32,192
But I wouldn't listen. I saw
only what I wanted to see.

Tell me... Tell me what you're
thinking. I've got to know.

I came as soon as I heard.
How did he die?

1034
01:30:14,684 --> 01:30:18,689
He's not dead, Vic. Not yet.

1035
01:30:18,814 --> 01:30:23,194
- Well, how did it happen?
- We don't know. He's still unconscious.

1036
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:25,341
- Maybe I can get him to tell me.
- Take it easy.

1037
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:28,965
- I've got to see him. I gotta know.
- The doc says his chances are just fair.

He may not wake up at all. You barging
in there won't help things any.

yourself a cup of coffee?

01:30:52,222 --> 01:30:54,145
I heard he fell.

1042
01:30:54,224 --> 01:30:58,104
Alec was too good a horseman
to fall out of a saddle.

Have any idea who'd want
to get rid of the old man?

Alec made a lot of enemies when
he was buildin' up the Barb.

1045
01:31:07,445 --> 01:31:09,539
But that was long ago.

1046
01:31:13,493 --> 01:31:16,212
- If I could just see him...
- Why don't you just sit down and relax, Vic?

01:31:16,288 --> 01:31:18,416
Kate's in there with him.

1048
01:31:52,741 --> 01:31:55,369
I can get him to talk, Kate. I know
him better than anybody else.

Who's that? Who is there?

1051
01:32:05,670 --> 01:32:09,641
- It's Will Lockhart, Mr. Waggoman.
- Oh, good.

1052
01:32:09,716 --> 01:32:12,765
Good. Come over here, Lockhart.

Ah, good. Sit down, huh?

1055
01:32:23,021 --> 01:32:26,321
I got going over those old bills.

1056

I found out about a

He made Dave do it.

Made Dave sign the order too.

1059

Wouldn't tell me where they were.

1060

But I know every hiding
spot in this country.

He killed Dave.

He tried to kill me too.

He didn't come from far
away to kill my boy.
