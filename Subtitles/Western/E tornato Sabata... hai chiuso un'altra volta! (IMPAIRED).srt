00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,441
(ticking)

2
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:51,161
(rhythmic squeaking)

3
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:04,321
(ticking)

4
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,521
(gunshot)

5
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:57,601
- (gun cocks)
- (Whispered) Sabata!

6
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:06,481
(rhythmic squeaking)

7
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:18,081
(gun cocks)

8
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:26,241
(gun cocks, fires)

9
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:36,481
(gun cocks)

10
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:41,241
(gunshots)

11
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,441
(Clicks)

12
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,001
(creaking)

13
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:17,001
(squeaking)

14
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:31,281
Now what do you do?
When your gun's empty.

15
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:35,001
And there isn't any time for you to reload.

16
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:41,161
Let me have your gun.

17
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:55,321
(yells)

18
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:02,081
(giggles)

19
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:07,961
The grand finale of the show.
Ping! Boom! Boom!

20
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:14,881
Ladies and gentlemen,
our next show's at 8.40. (chuckles)

21
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:18,441
(circus com-pah brass band music plays)

22
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:21,401
Wheee!

23
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:24,121
(laughter and whooping)

24
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,721
Come one, come all!

25
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:32,561
(man) Ladies and gentlemen,
come back again.

26
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:35,961
Tell your friends
the fine people of the city of Hobsonville

27
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:40,081
can't afford to miss
the most unique show of all time.

28
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:44,201
Anyone who can hold a gun is eligible
for challenging our champion.

29
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:48,721
Make your reservations now for the next
show, beginning at 8.40 this evening.

30
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:52,961
Up to six contestants will be permitted
to compete at the same time.

31
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:58,001
Don't pass up this chance to show your skills.
It only costs a dollar.

32
00:05:58,201 --> 00:06:01,521
The burned cartridges,
the gun and the challenger's shirt

33
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:05,681
decorated with a souvenir you can wear
proudly are included in the price.

34
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:09,521
Extraordinary. How do you do it?
All those bullets are real.

35
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:12,841
- Would you like to try one yourself?
- I couldn't!

36
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:24,121
("M") Step Tight up, gentlemen!
Apply right now.

37
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:29,321
Anyone who manages to beat our champion
wins ten times the money he paid.

38
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:35,121
This way, gentlemen!
There's the cashier.

39
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:46,641
Don't pass up the chance to match your skill
in marksmanship with our great champion.

40
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:55,321
Citizens of Hobsonville, here's your
opportunity to challenge our great champion.

41
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:58,601
Prove to yourself what a
steady hand you have,

42
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:02,201
what a good eye,
and what a sharp aim you've got.

43
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,241
Hey, watch it, will you?

44
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:38,841
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

45
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:44,401
Sabata, Sabata

46
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,521
The fastest gun in the West

47
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:48,641
I said. The fastest gun in the West

48
00:07:48,841 --> 00:07:54,561
Nine-fingered man. Four-barrelled derringer

49
00:07:54,761 --> 00:08:02,481
Sabata is the o n I y invincible man
In the countryside

50
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:07,481
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

51
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:12,161
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

52
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,361
So

53
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,921
You've got your life if he lets you go

54
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:21,681
- Sabata!
- Go, go, go!

55
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:25,681
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

56
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:30,441
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

57
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:35,481
If you wanna get money
And if you wanna get rich

58
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,241
And if you want a good life
You've got to be a son of a...

59
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:44,401
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

60
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:48,521
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

61
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:51,121
If you wanna get money

62
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,681
- If you wanna get rich
- If you wanna get rich

63
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:57,641
- If you want a good life
- You gotta be a son of a...

64
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:02,001
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

65
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:07,481
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

66
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,361
Sabata

67
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:12,441
The fastest gun in the West

68
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:16,201
Four-barrelled derringer

69
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:19,761
He's the o n I y invincible man
In the countryside

70
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:22,161
Sabata, Sabata...

71
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,041
- Major.
- At ease.

72
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,681
Lieutenant.

73
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,041
Why did you run off?

74
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:38,681
I didn't want you to be upset.
(laughs nervously)

75
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:43,241
I mean, when I saw my superior officer
ending up in a sideshow...

76
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:48,041
- There are worse places to be.
- What do you mean?

77
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,201
Nothing.

78
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:57,561
- You remember this?
- Hey! My good-luck piece.

79
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:00,801
The medal I won in the war.

80
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:05,801
Lost it at poker, remember?
You can win it back at poker if you want.

81
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,081
No more poker. I'm finished with that game.

82
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:13,361
Even if three years are passed,
I haven't forgotten that 5,000 I owe you.

83
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:17,281
I've begun saving,
and I'll pay it back to you one day.

84
00:10:17,481 --> 00:10:21,401
- I give you my word.
- It is pretty difficult to cash that.

85
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,041
- Where can I find you?
- Right here in Hobsonville.

86
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:31,401
I got a friend, runs a gambling house.
We were in the army.

87
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:33,681
You picked the worst place.

88
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:37,161
Hobsonville doesn't have
any money to spare.

89
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,441
(jaunty piano)

90
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:46,201
20, black. Number 20 wins the round.

91
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:49,241
There you are.

92
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:54,201
Lieutenant, this town is rotten.

93
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:57,161
It's really rotten.

94
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:00,721
You're winning, Major.

95
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:06,241
- I would like to talk to you.
- Right now?

96
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:08,561
Before you break the bank.

97
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:12,801
Place your bets. Place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen, please.

98
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:15,601
The yellow goes on number eight. Very well.

99
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:19,801
Place your bets down, everybody.
Round and round she goes.

100
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:49,641
- You're a rich man.
- I'm listening.

101
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:58,361
If you play with a magnet in your cigar case,
there's a bigger gambling joint at Redstone.

102
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:01,161
You'll do even better there.

103
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:10,641
You see, Major, here in Hobsonville,
we're all honest, hard-working folks.

104
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:15,561
Here.

105
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:22,281
I pried this magnet
from under your roulette table.

106
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:27,441
(whistles) You mean you won without any help?
Damn, what luck.

107
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:30,081
What's lucky about it?

108
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:37,361
You should be a sleight-of-hand artist.

109
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:40,041
They have one working at the circus.

110
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:44,961
His name is Pickles.

111
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:56,521
- Partners?
- Well...

112
00:12:56,721 --> 00:13:01,881
Don't worry. Only until you pay back
the 5,000 you owe me.

113
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:10,961
- Where do I change these, with the cashier?
- I'll do it.

114
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:19,401
- How come there are so many Irishmen?
- They got an organization.

115
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:22,761
They work for the progress of Hobsonville,
a big family.

116
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:26,481
All those brothers, cousins, in-laws.
Can't keep track of 'em.

117
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:30,561
The family is run by Joel McIntock,
who's the smartest one.

118
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:34,121
(sombre music on organ)

119
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:56,721
(Irish accent) That soul who hath
horses and golden robes, sayeth the beggar,

120
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:00,321
and jars overflowing
with gold and precious stones,

121
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:05,401
he shall place at thy feet his riches,
woman, for thou art here to be purchased.

122
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:11,001
But she who is full of the grace of the
Lord God spurneth riches and golden robes.

123
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:13,481
We pray to Thee, O Lord, to keep us away

124
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:19,521
from men possessed of the fleeting pleasures
of the carnal urge, of violence, of discord.

125
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:23,601
O, Father, let us go back
to the innocence we knew originally,

126
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:27,401
so we can claim our future in Christ.

127
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:31,361
- Amen.
- (Congregation) Amen.

128
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:34,761
- (priest coughs)
- (Sombre organ music)

129
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,881
- A splendid sermon, Father.
- Thank you. Thank you.

130
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:00,961
- Beautiful.
- I was glad to be here.

131
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:04,601
- A memorable service. Thank you.
- God bless you. Good day.

132
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:11,961
(whispers)

133
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,801
- (dramatic chords on organ)
- Not here.

134
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:27,961
You're supposed to eliminate an enemy
of the organization and you've failed.

135
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:45,041
Thank the Lord you're alive,
because you really owe it to Him.

136
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:47,961
Mercy is what I have learned from Him.

137
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:10,961
- What's that?
- 100. Just take it off what you owe me.

138
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,241
Hey, love the view.

139
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:47,001
- California, I'd say.
- No.

140
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:49,561
Obviously further east.

141
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:53,321
Well, a ten-spot says you're mistaken.

142
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:57,161
Pal, you've already lost.

143
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:07,441
I bet that guy there ten dollars
you come from Missouri.

144
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:12,481
- That's true.
- You worked in Madame Boisset's in St Louis.

145
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:15,001
Right again. I worked there.

146
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,841
Ah. And what are you doing here?

147
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,801
Working the town for a two-week run.

148
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:25,081
Well, you picked the right place.
Hobsonville's lousy with money.

149
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:29,721
Should be good here.
I'll bet you're sold out in advance.

150
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:34,761
For a guy like you, I guess
I can always make an exception, can't I?

151
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:38,481
- Yah!
- Yah!

152
00:17:54,441 --> 00:17:57,881
Get outta here! Go and find someplace else.

153
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:13,921
(horse whinnies)

154
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:18,641
(door opens and closes)

155
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,481
Still here?

156
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:24,201
(sighs) Waiting for somebody?

157
00:18:28,161 --> 00:18:31,361
I found it! Now you see it...

158
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:40,361
- ..now you don't.
- When somebody's as lucky as you,

159
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:43,241
you have to lighten their burden.

160
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:48,721
Get out, you two.

161
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:52,201
It was just a misunderstanding.

162
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,961
It won't happen again, Major.

163
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:11,361
You guys are pretty good.

164
00:19:26,441 --> 00:19:28,201
Pickles!

165
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:14,801
(man) Five minutes, Mr Pickles!
Five minutes!

166
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:24,201
Sleeping, Mr Pickles?

167
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:31,721
(man) Help! Help!

168
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:34,081
Somebody killed Diane!

169
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:16,081
(laughs drunkenly)

170
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:34,521
The statement of the circus proprietor
makes perfectly clear

171
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:37,241
the relationship between
the girl and Josiah Pickles.

172
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:40,801
No doubt he killed her.
Obviously a crime of passion.

173
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:48,041
I'm sorry to see you go, Sabata.
If you change your mind...

174
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:53,441
Ed Cunningham will do fine replacing me.
If you need me, I'll be in Clyde's saloon.

175
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,361
(breathes heavily)

176
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,961
Thanks very much. I'll smoke it later.

177
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:08,481
Now.

178
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:17,001
- How's business?
- Couldn't be better, stranger.

179
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:20,441
This town's exploding by leaps and bounds.
Right, Mr Mayor?

180
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:21,601
(snorts)

181
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:24,761
- What did he say?
- Mr Mayor is the horse's name.

182
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:29,201
(snarls) Go on!
Now, if you'd arrived a year ago...

183
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:37,481
Hot and cold running water.
All the luxuries.

184
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:42,641
It's the room I reserve
for my special guests.

185
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:46,401
Great. The only trouble is,
it's right next door to you.

186
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:49,921
It'll be somebody to help you.

187
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,761
With what?

188
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:57,561
I know you had nothing to do with that
business in the circus. Or that girl.

189
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:02,441
You're wrong. She's the one
that gave me the information on Pickles.

190
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:07,361
I've been with that circus for two months.
I had a hunch on something big.

191
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:09,801
Now...

192
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,481
Oh, well. If you need a helping hand...

193
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:14,441
I mean...

194
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:18,801
Yeah.

195
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:22,601
I maybe could use a helping... finger.

196
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,641
There's a lot of redheads
loose around here.

197
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:33,521
Well, I'm at your beck and call, Major.

198
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:36,841
You know you can trust me.

199
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:41,081
Don't forget, Major, during the war
I was at your side with the South.

200
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:45,121
I suppose that's another reason we lost,
Lieutenant.

201
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:59,681
Hey, stranger, you didn't pay any tax.

202
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:04,601
- It's written right here.
- On basic necessities, it's five per cent.

203
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:08,361
And 50 per cent for houses of pleasure?

204
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:12,201
- No discounts?
- A shave comes under luxuries.

205
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:17,041
- That's 20 per cent.
- And if I don't want to pay?

206
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:19,201
(ominous drumbeat)

207
00:24:19,401 --> 00:24:23,721
Here's to the McIntocks of Hobsonville!

208
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:27,841
Ladies and gents, citizens of Hobsonville,

209
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:32,641
we all want our town to expand and grow
richer, earn the respect of other cities.

210
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:37,761
To do that, we must all pay our
contributions for a better tomorrow.

211
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:47,881
Oh, my friend!

212
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:50,161
My generous friend.

213
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,841
See that man over there?

214
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:28,361
I bought this weapon, the same as yours,
a year ago for $12.

215
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:32,721
If you're gonna charge me 24, taxes or not,
that sounds like legalized theft.

216
00:25:32,961 --> 00:25:35,921
Never mind, mister.
We don't like strangers with tough talk.

217
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:39,121
(ominous drumbeat)

218
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:49,601
Good citizens, don't pay any attention
to the wild words of the stranger here.

219
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:52,801
He don't respect the same things
you good men do,

220
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:55,921
the sacred Bible, the blessed Saviour.

221
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:02,441
Don't offend Sabata.
A portion from the Proverbs.

222
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:07,121
Nothing, nothing. I asked the man
to put out my cigar, that's all.

223
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:10,641
You know an organization
that's cheating us all? I do!

224
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:13,641
- McIntock's!
- Huh?

225
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:16,881
Anyone who uses trickery, money or violence

226
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:21,641
to swindle innocent, unsuspecting people
and treats them as simpletons,

227
00:26:21,841 --> 00:26:24,881
nobody can call that man a Christian.

228
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:32,481
(laughs)

229
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:34,921
Try some.

230
00:26:37,441 --> 00:26:40,921
You get more attractive every
time I see you. Come here.

231
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:47,041
- I don't have to tell you what's in that package.
- I'll figure it out.

232
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:49,321
You can't believe the papers.

233
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:53,161
- Decide what you're here for.
- I wanna go with you, but I can't.

234
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:57,681
- How about it? 20 all right?
- (Man) I didn't know what to do!

235
00:26:59,961 --> 00:27:01,721
Hello, Henry.

236
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:05,801
Cows, man. I can tell you how old they are
by their teeth...

237
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:10,481
Your wife's teeth,
they must be all gold by now, right?

238
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:16,881
You're offended. Rosette!
I was talking about my cow, Evelina.

239
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:19,881
I wouldn't make any remarks about your age.

240
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:24,481
But since you're getting personal,
only this morning I was raring to go.

241
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:27,681
A good place for umbrellas.

242
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:30,041
(laughter)

243
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:40,761
You can look but don't touch, Junior.

244
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:45,961
- First time?
- No!

245
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:48,361
I come here every day.

246
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,721
- Every day?
- Uh-huh.

247
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:54,481
Only so far... I haven't got the nerve.

248
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:03,801
Maggie was asking about you.
Says she won't charge you for it.

249
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:07,801
- Just the town planning tax.
- And what if I don't pay?

250
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:12,081
I'll show you the exit door,
and even open it for you.

251
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,601
That won't be necessary. I know the way.

252
00:28:16,841 --> 00:28:18,841
(jaunty piano)

253
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,241
Let's go.

254
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:32,041
Chuck!

255
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:42,481
Where are you going?

256
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:45,161
I have an appointment
with your leading lady.

257
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:49,241
- She's rehearsing.
- She wouldn't begin the show without me.

258
00:28:49,401 --> 00:28:51,641
Why? Who are you?

259
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:54,641
Well, I'm her prompter.

260
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:02,361
Hey, Joe. Tell him it's OK. Sabata.

261
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:05,281
(women) Oh, God!

262
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:07,281
Sabata!

263
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:19,481
- As a prompter, he's not bad.
- What do you mean, prompter?

264
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:23,801
- He must be the stage manager!
- (All laugh)

265
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:30,721
Come here.

266
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:35,881
Please. Please!

267
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:41,361
Citizens!

268
00:29:56,201 --> 00:29:58,681
(squeals) What's the matter with you?

269
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,921
- Go on, boy!
- (Whoops)

270
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:07,401
- Leave me alone!
- Sabata! Watch out!

271
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:16,121
Here you are, stranger!

272
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:23,121
A good way to explain here's the way out.
These Irishmen stink up the place.

273
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,641
Worse than some cigars.

274
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:27,521
Aw!

275
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:32,281
<i>WOW groan)</i>

276
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:36,601
All right, Sabata, what
the hell's going on?

277
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:40,681
- He refuses to pay a penny in taxes.
- It's the truth, Sheriff.

278
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,761
He said our taxes are "legalized theft".

279
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:49,041
If you don't obey our laws,
I'll be obliged to arrest you.

280
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:53,241
- Hey!
- At this rate, he won't get far.

281
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:55,401
Sheriff!

282
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:58,601
(shouting)

283
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:08,961
Have any of you ever seen a 50-dollar bill?

284
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:11,481
There's one right here for you!

285
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:14,881
Don't push, Grandpa!
You'll be dead before you get upstairs.

286
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,241
I'm better than you, buster!

287
00:31:21,441 --> 00:31:25,161
Stranger, don't pretend
you don't understand.

288
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:31,241
The Bible says, "Do unto others
as you would have others do unto you."

289
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,641
You know your way around.

290
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:55,401
We may not think the same way,
but I still like you.

291
00:31:55,641 --> 00:31:57,681
I'm doing you a good turn.

292
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:02,001
Without the contributors, Hobsonville
wouldn't be the same place it is.

293
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:06,481
The citizens pay willingly
because before this plan of McIntock's...

294
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:10,761
If you insist, beat your drum,
but mind your own business.

295
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:12,761
Oh!

296
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:46,801
This is a peaceful city,

297
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:52,121
where every citizen respects the law and
pays his contribution for a better tomorrow.

298
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:55,241
Boom-boom. All you lack is a drum.

299
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:59,401
- Quiet.
- (Sabata) McIntock.

300
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:04,441
Your organization must be making a lot
of money to pay for all this publicity.

301
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:07,281
No answer to that?

302
00:33:07,481 --> 00:33:10,161
They tell me you're a good gambler.

303
00:33:10,361 --> 00:33:13,321
I'm always looking for the odds.

304
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:21,921
A year ago, there arrived in Hobsonville
a man whose spirit resembled yours.

305
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:24,721
He was fine handling a pistol.

306
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,321
But he kept on interfering with us.

307
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:31,481
He disappeared suddenly.

308
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:39,041
- Somebody did the poor man in.
- His finger. Guess it wasn't steady.

309
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:41,401
You can cheat at gambling,

310
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:45,561
but for this, why risk your life?

311
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:49,641
That's right.
So why should you risk yours, McIntock?

312
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:55,001
Just a minute. Who are you?

313
00:33:58,841 --> 00:34:01,601
Somebody who's looking for the odds.

314
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:04,041
Not bad before breakfast.

315
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:30,481
(gasps)

316
00:34:38,681 --> 00:34:41,361
When are you going to begin making love?

317
00:35:19,841 --> 00:35:24,201
- Customers of yours?
- I don't know anything about them.

318
00:35:38,201 --> 00:35:42,921
- Don't try any fooling around.
- I've had enough exercise.

319
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:48,361
- Remember, no noise.
- I'll go along with that.

320
00:35:55,881 --> 00:35:57,281
(gasps)

321
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:02,761
Sorry about the noise.
I think your mother's waiting for you.

322
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,881
Bye.

323
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:20,201
(Sabata) You see, Maggie, I'm old-fashioned.
I don't like orgies.

324
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:24,801
- Anyone hurt?
- I just want a little peace...

325
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,761
...and quiet.

326
00:36:37,881 --> 00:36:43,041
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

327
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:45,481
I'd like to take a ride.

328
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:48,241
I'm beginning to understand your McIntock.

329
00:36:48,441 --> 00:36:51,281
I knew that you'd get
together with McIntock.

330
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:56,921
You're doing great.

331
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:04,001
And you, Mr Mayor. When are you going to
get such a filly for yourself? Ha!

332
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:05,201
Now!

333
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,881
(groans)

334
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:13,881
Now here's where they'll erect
a fine new church.

335
00:37:14,121 --> 00:37:16,521
A new school, right over there.

336
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:20,681
The new food market, stockyards,
railroad station,

337
00:37:20,921 --> 00:37:24,521
the new bank and the biggest
and best hospital in Texas.

338
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,721
- Horse manure!
- Ach!

339
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:29,841
(sighs)

340
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:47,401
And a new newspaper's going to
be established right there, see?

341
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:51,361
So...

342
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:55,481
That's why I say you
ought to pay your share.

343
00:37:56,961 --> 00:38:01,441
It isn't that much, a little percentage
on items deemed necessary.

344
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:05,601
20 per cent on luxury items,
50 per cent on women and gambling.

345
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:08,841
- (trickling)
- Keep talking like that and they'll raise it.

346
00:38:09,041 --> 00:38:11,081
(sighs)

347
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:14,601
You put him down
because you don't know Mr McIntock.

348
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:19,041
He's careful. He wants all the money
in the safe before he does anything.

349
00:38:19,241 --> 00:38:21,281
(man) Hey, over there!

350
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:26,481
Hi, Bronco.

351
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:29,001
Get away, you good for nothings!

352
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:35,201
How many times do I have to tell you? Keep
away from here! If I catch you, watch out!

353
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:38,161
Let's

354
00:38:51,201 --> 00:38:53,321
(Bronco) Ah! Whoa!

355
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:57,761
You know why I'm for McIntock?

356
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:02,441
Because he was a miner,
a man of the people, same as me.

357
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:05,441
Look at that mine. He worked it for years.

358
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:07,961
Found all kinds of things, graves,

359
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:11,881
caves millions of years old where people
once lived, an underground river.

360
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:14,241
But gold? Not a trace.

361
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:17,081
Come on now, tell me your thoughts.

362
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:23,401
- I think he's already found it.
- Nobody's honest if it's up to you.

363
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:27,081
I'll bet not even your own mother.

364
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:30,681
- Well...
- Mm?

365
00:39:30,881 --> 00:39:33,041
Oh... Ha!

366
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:37,161
(jaunty piano)

367
00:39:56,721 --> 00:40:00,681
Waiting here, Maggie, can mean losing
quite a lot of business.

368
00:40:00,881 --> 00:40:03,441
He's my business.

369
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:08,681
(Sabata) Those two over there,
they'd pay any price you ask.

370
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:15,121
And without any trouble-making.
Who are they?

371
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:18,201
The Braddock brothers.

372
00:40:18,401 --> 00:40:22,441
They make a business trip here
twice a year from California.

373
00:40:22,641 --> 00:40:26,081
California? Lots of gold out there.

374
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:29,161
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.

375
00:40:29,401 --> 00:40:31,521
Thank you, ma'am.

376
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,161
You sir, you got your chips down?

377
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:40,921
Stick close to me, partner.
You bring me luck.

378
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:55,001
- I'm informed that you have a magnet on you.
- By who?

379
00:40:55,201 --> 00:41:01,641
That's confidential information. I also
know you carry other illegal objects.

380
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:04,201
Hand me your cigar, eh?

381
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,601
Aha.

382
00:41:32,841 --> 00:41:38,041
If you don't win this time,
it will be my duty to lock you up.

383
00:41:51,721 --> 00:41:53,521
Go on.

384
00:42:10,001 --> 00:42:12,121
Fourteen red.

385
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,241
(laughter)

386
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:24,681
Pretty good, huh? (Laughs)

387
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:54,201
Cash it in. And no city tax.

388
00:42:54,401 --> 00:42:57,241
We were waiting to hear you say that.

389
00:43:13,121 --> 00:43:16,081
It's a see-saw game. Two
coins, a race, a kick.

390
00:43:16,321 --> 00:43:20,401
The first to grab the coin flipped
into the air wins them both.

391
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:24,361
Except that this time,
instead of using silver dollars,

392
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:26,961
we'll play with these.

393
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:48,441
(murmuring)

394
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:25,801
Lieutenant, I could use
that helping finger now.

395
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:42,681
Ah...

396
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,641
Take four steps.

397
00:45:33,321 --> 00:45:35,801
Come on.

398
00:45:36,041 --> 00:45:38,761
What are you waiting for? Fire!

399
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:42,001
(Clicks)

400
00:45:43,081 --> 00:45:44,321
Ha-ha!

401
00:45:58,521 --> 00:46:01,321
Maybe you'd rather have this one.

402
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,641
I'll show you how it works.

403
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:23,281
HEB-ya!

404
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:28,361
Ha!

405
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:50,681
Sabata, Sabata!

406
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:54,201
Sabata, Sabata...

407
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:01,041
Good luck! See you all later!
Drop dead.

408
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:12,361
The next time you try anything like this,
I'll skin you alive!

409
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:14,641
And I won't wait until later.

410
00:47:14,841 --> 00:47:17,641
Those bolts are all right.
Why'd you take them?

411
00:47:17,841 --> 00:47:20,521
Well, I needed them in a hurry.

412
00:47:23,001 --> 00:47:28,121
I'll tear you apart! No, not you!
Take it easy, take it easy.

413
00:47:33,121 --> 00:47:34,961
- Lieutenant.
- (Falls silent)

414
00:47:35,241 --> 00:47:37,521
You're really the clown.

415
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:51,121
I decide things around here.
Nobody orders anybody except me.

416
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:53,161
Nobody!

417
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:17,681
To bring violence into
a peaceful place like Hobsonville,

418
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:19,801
where legality is a due process

419
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:24,961
supporting a program of reconstruction
that is a shining example to everybody...

420
00:48:26,121 --> 00:48:28,961
...is against the judgment
of Joel McIntock.

421
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:39,041
That friend of yours is a
lot of trouble for us.

422
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:42,681
- When is he leaving?
- Well, we're partners.

423
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:46,121
I couldn't help it. I was forced into it.

424
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:49,641
Lowed him money for an old gambling debt.

425
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:53,881
5,000 dollars.

426
00:48:54,081 --> 00:48:56,361
(laughs)

427
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,121
I'll lend it to you.

428
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:10,681
And get rid of him.

429
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:13,801
This rotten town suits me just fine.

430
00:49:16,321 --> 00:49:20,641
So McIntock gave you 5,000 dollars
to get rid of me.

431
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:27,761
- By staying partners, we could earn more.
- I see what you're aiming for.

432
00:49:27,961 --> 00:49:30,681
- And if you swindle me?
- I'm not like you.

433
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:34,841
No? A guy who'd shoot his
finger off in wartime,

434
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:39,681
just to spend his 20 days' convalescence
with the colonel's wife, is worse.

435
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:43,761
You weren't wrong. He was a pig,
she was lovely, he deserved it.

436
00:49:44,001 --> 00:49:46,521
But you take advantage of any situation.

437
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:48,001
Look out!

438
00:49:53,641 --> 00:49:58,481
What do you think?
Were they shooting at you, or at me?

439
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:02,001
At both of us.
They want their 5,000 back.

440
00:50:07,281 --> 00:50:09,041
Partners?

441
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:13,441
(laughs) Yes. To the end.

442
00:50:13,641 --> 00:50:18,681
I know Sabata. He'll get to you
and that will be the end of everybody.

443
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:24,521
Let's go.

444
00:50:40,801 --> 00:50:42,961
That's my watch.

445
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:47,041
Sit down.

446
00:50:56,601 --> 00:51:02,321
You know, Major, all the contributions
made by the citizens for Hobsonville,

447
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:05,241
hundreds of thousands of dollars...

448
00:51:06,881 --> 00:51:11,121
...are in Jeremy Sweeney's safe.
He's the banker, as well as the mayor.

449
00:51:13,121 --> 00:51:15,521
McIntock's future brother-in-law.

450
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:18,961
Well...

451
00:51:19,721 --> 00:51:24,121
Because it's a family affair,
they're sure to want to split it up.

452
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:27,041
We have to make sure the
money's still there.

453
00:51:27,241 --> 00:51:29,721
How do you figure to do that?

454
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:32,001
It's not difficult.

455
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:37,321
All you have to have is a drum
and a man who believes in McIntock

456
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:41,601
as though he were Our Lady of Pilar
or Guadalupe or something.

457
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:44,801
- (applause)
- (Woman) McIntock!

458
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:57,361
(people shout) McIntock! McIntock!

459
00:51:57,561 --> 00:52:01,201
McIntock! McIntock! McIntock!

460
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:07,041
Citizens of Hobsonville,
Joel McIntock has a great announcement

461
00:52:07,241 --> 00:52:09,401
he wants to make personally.

462
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,561
Friends, the trust that you placed in me
these last three years,

463
00:52:21,761 --> 00:52:24,641
waiting for this announcement,
is the best reward.

464
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:31,161
Now here it is. We're to begin our
construction to make Hobsonville better.

465
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:33,841
A city we can all be proud of,

466
00:52:34,081 --> 00:52:37,041
a shining, moral home
for our menfolk and women,

467
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:42,001
our women whose morality provides us with an
example of righteous and virtuous conduct

468
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,801
for our children and our
children's children.

469
00:52:45,001 --> 00:52:47,161
(cheering and applause)

470
00:53:03,201 --> 00:53:05,881
- No, no, no!
- (Whistles)

471
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:22,761
Stop! Please, I hate violence.

472
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:27,921
Hmm.

473
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:34,001
Mm-hm...

474
00:53:36,761 --> 00:53:39,761
You were really marvelous, Joel.

475
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:42,161
Thank you.

476
00:53:42,401 --> 00:53:45,961
What would I do without you?

477
00:53:55,761 --> 00:53:59,241
So that's how you're fighting McIntock.

478
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:02,961
Well, yours isn't the only way to fight.

479
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:05,881
- Don't upset things, please!
- (Laughs)

480
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:09,801
I know how to get rid of the bank guards.

481
00:54:10,001 --> 00:54:12,761
(melancholy harmonica)

482
00:55:06,921 --> 00:55:10,841
(plays jauntier tune)

483
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:37,641
(jaunty tune continues)

484
00:55:45,761 --> 00:55:47,401
McDonald!

485
00:55:53,161 --> 00:55:55,521
- Come down here.
- Coming!

486
00:56:11,441 --> 00:56:12,881
(knock at door)

487
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,721
O'Brien, it's Ferdy.

488
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:22,841
Open UP-

489
00:57:12,441 --> 00:57:16,481
- It won't open.
- Something's very funny.

490
00:57:16,681 --> 00:57:19,401
- (Sabata) Him.
- I? No.

491
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:22,601
- (Clyde) No.
- Take the bolt from the top.

492
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:26,001
- It's double-locked.
- You didn't know?

493
00:57:26,201 --> 00:57:28,161
I wasn't sure.

494
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:35,601
- The key!
- Leave it there. Come on!

495
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:04,361
Mm-hm.

496
00:58:06,721 --> 00:58:09,481
- (screams)
- Jackie!

497
00:58:14,401 --> 00:58:16,001
Jackie!

498
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:27,961
- Do we leave Clyde inside?
- He'll take care of himself.

499
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:31,641
What do you think you're doing?
We got plenty of bolts.

500
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,081
They're prettier.

501
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,761
What is it? Jackie?

502
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:43,361
What did you scream like that for?

503
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:20,561
The valises. Get the valises, quickly.

504
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:25,841
(whistles cheerful tune)

505
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:48,521
(horse whinnies)

506
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:05,481
Hee-ya! Hee-ya!

507
01:00:20,641 --> 01:00:26,761
- Major, I...
- Misere, misere

508
01:00:26,961 --> 01:00:32,201
- Misere, misere, misere...
- (Gun fires)

509
01:00:32,441 --> 01:00:34,401
(grunts)

510
01:00:40,921 --> 01:00:43,241
First time I ever missed.

511
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:47,081
Put the wheels back on.

512
01:00:47,281 --> 01:00:49,161
Hee-ya! Hee-ya!

513
01:00:58,161 --> 01:01:00,041
Listen, partner...

514
01:01:03,321 --> 01:01:06,321
- Back to town.
- What do we do with the money?

515
01:01:06,521 --> 01:01:09,961
It's the only place
they won't shoot us in the back.

516
01:01:14,961 --> 01:01:18,241
Follow those two with the valises, quick!

517
01:01:50,201 --> 01:01:53,121
(horse whinnies)

518
01:01:59,161 --> 01:02:00,401
Hey!

519
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,361
With all that cash,
you waste time stealing a watch?

520
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:30,921
It's the only one of its kind.

521
01:02:58,561 --> 01:03:00,601
(horses whinny)

522
01:03:00,801 --> 01:03:03,081
The water storage shack.

523
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:07,761
- They're coming in.
- Let's go out the back window.

524
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:32,441
- The bags, or your lives.
- Stranger, you notice a bad smell here?

525
01:03:36,401 --> 01:03:39,161
- Let it go!
- (Men yell)

526
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:42,601
- (men) Turn it off!
- It's better now. (Cackles)

527
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:06,161
Lieutenant?

528
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:09,441
Where you going?

529
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:14,841
(laughs)

530
01:04:24,521 --> 01:04:27,841
I really wasn't looking to duck out.

531
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:31,001
- I'd be a son of a...
- Maybe you are.

532
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:35,761
But if our mothers walked the same streets,
mine had more customers.

533
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:39,841
Unfortunately, McIntock's little old lady
was the best of all time.

534
01:04:40,041 --> 01:04:42,481
We've been had, partner.

535
01:04:43,641 --> 01:04:47,841
What would you say if I told you
all that was counterfeit?

536
01:04:51,401 --> 01:04:53,921
You're crazy. You're lying.

537
01:04:57,281 --> 01:04:59,401
It's a joke.

538
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:03,961
- That's what I thought.
- Clyde!

539
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:08,241
- Clyde, I must tell you something.
- I know already.

540
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:10,281
The money's counterfeit.

541
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:13,761
That McIntock you're so busy two-timing...

542
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:17,001
- Where does he keep the real stuff?
- How would I know?

543
01:05:17,201 --> 01:05:18,881
Liar.

544
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,121
The bags.

545
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:26,961
Why don't you believe me, Major?
Just once, huh?

546
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,881
All right, boys. Let's go.

547
01:05:31,321 --> 01:05:34,521
- Where shall I go?
- There's a lady present.

548
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:39,921
And you wouldn't like it.

549
01:05:58,681 --> 01:06:01,121
This is the last batch he made.

550
01:06:01,321 --> 01:06:03,401
Aren't they splendid, Jeremy?

551
01:06:06,321 --> 01:06:08,681
What is it?

552
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:13,841
- No one could ever spot these.
- I've never approved the idea.

553
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:19,041
More time passes, I'm convinced you left
your brains somewhere back in the mine.

554
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,161
(McIntock laughs)

555
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:37,521
A few days and we'll be gone.

556
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:42,001
The town can crumble into dust,
a lot more than they deserve.

557
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:44,761
A fake Caesar.

558
01:06:44,961 --> 01:06:47,641
With all money carrying your features.

559
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:54,121
Right in there is our entire fortune.

560
01:06:54,361 --> 01:06:57,561
We'll buy that man's silence.
We can afford anything.

561
01:06:57,761 --> 01:07:01,281
If he can't be bought,
somebody will dispose of him.

562
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:24,041
The everlasting Father is good and
generous, and so must man be.

563
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:28,721
Thus man is blessed. Amen.

564
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:42,961
I took this watch off one of your men.

565
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:49,961
It belongs to Pickles, Josiah Pickles,
by profession a counterfeiter,

566
01:07:50,161 --> 01:07:54,321
known to most of the circus audience
as a sleight-of-hand artist.

567
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:17,441
I ran into Pickles just after the war.

568
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:22,561
I found out about his... profession.

569
01:08:25,001 --> 01:08:30,561
I figured he'd find some way to make it pay off.
So I trailed him.

570
01:08:30,761 --> 01:08:32,961
(McIntock) Very interesting.

571
01:08:34,201 --> 01:08:36,681
So I wound up joining the circus.

572
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:57,201
(big-top oom-pah brass band music)

573
01:09:09,161 --> 01:09:10,921
Nice, huh?

574
01:09:11,161 --> 01:09:14,361
The circus always has its fascinations.

575
01:09:14,561 --> 01:09:16,761
Comes here twice a year.

576
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:21,401
In three years, that's six movements of
counterfeit money for the McIntock projects.

577
01:09:22,841 --> 01:09:27,841
Trouble is, I came with the last shipment.
For an Irishman, you're not very hospitable.

578
01:09:28,881 --> 01:09:30,761
Whiskey?

579
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:35,121
Why the face?

580
01:09:35,321 --> 01:09:39,601
A million dollars in counterfeit money.
Don't know what to do with it.

581
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:43,241
Now, you'd stick it in the safe.

582
01:09:43,441 --> 01:09:47,881
But why would you take so much trouble
to get it back?

583
01:09:49,441 --> 01:09:53,801
But wait a minute.
Maybe you can't put the real ones in.

584
01:09:54,041 --> 01:09:58,521
Of course you can't. They're
in California, right?

585
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:01,521
A miner can't find gold, so he buys it?

586
01:10:01,721 --> 01:10:08,041
I don't want to spoil your game so I'll sell you
these counterfeit notes for ten per cent, in gold.

587
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:14,241
I'll stop by the bank later and cash it in.
Tell your partner.

588
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:16,961
You'll never get away with this.

589
01:10:20,561 --> 01:10:24,001
- You look worried. Have a sip.
- (Gasps)

590
01:10:29,161 --> 01:10:31,761
- The show's over.
- (Music ends)

591
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:34,241
Tell your partner.

592
01:10:37,561 --> 01:10:41,481
- I'll be in before the bank closes.
- Sabata!

593
01:10:41,681 --> 01:10:46,601
Not at the bank. I'll bring it to you.
The full amount. To the mine.

594
01:10:55,241 --> 01:10:59,161
Counterfeit money?
What do you think you're doing?

595
01:10:59,401 --> 01:11:04,201
Why don't you tell everybody in Hobsonville
instead of covering up for McIntock?

596
01:11:04,441 --> 01:11:07,961
McIntock promised to give me
ten per cent in real dollars.

597
01:11:08,201 --> 01:11:13,161
Then they won't lose their savings for nothing.
What do you think of that?

598
01:11:13,361 --> 01:11:15,401
Oh. Hm.

599
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:20,361
- Don't you trust me?
- Hm...

600
01:11:20,561 --> 01:11:24,401
(man) Hey, up there! The
boss is waiting for you.

601
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:29,081
- Whoa.
- (Man) Use the sled if you want.

602
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:44,521
For the people.

603
01:12:30,641 --> 01:12:32,641
Stranger.

604
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:51,441
Stranger, how'd you get out?
Stranger, how'd you do it?

605
01:12:51,641 --> 01:12:53,921
(laughs)

606
01:13:32,361 --> 01:13:36,521
(Sabata) "You did wrong, Mac. If I don't
have my ten per cent by noon tomorrow",

607
01:13:36,761 --> 01:13:40,601
all Hobsonville will hear
about the counterfeit money."

608
01:13:50,601 --> 01:13:52,961
Oh. Spent the night again, huh?

609
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:57,001
What's the old guy got?

610
01:13:57,241 --> 01:14:00,721
Lieutenant, you shouldn't
ask questions like that.

611
01:14:00,921 --> 01:14:04,241
Why don't you send Jackie
for a few lessons?

612
01:14:06,761 --> 01:14:09,521
- School's downstairs.
- (Clyde laughs)

613
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:12,401
ls Maggie teaching school?

614
01:14:14,161 --> 01:14:16,481
- What class?
- More advanced than you.

615
01:14:16,721 --> 01:14:19,481
I've been teaching for years. I like it.

616
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:22,601
And the principal is very
pleased with her work.

617
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:31,081
Major, it's almost time.
Where's McIntock?

618
01:14:50,081 --> 01:14:52,001
(ominous drumbeat)

619
01:15:02,481 --> 01:15:06,161
Citizens of Hobsonville!
Finally the truth is out.

620
01:15:06,361 --> 01:15:09,121
- The whole scandal is coming...
- (Gunshots)

621
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:11,681
(shouts of confusion)

622
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:46,961
Sabata!

623
01:15:47,161 --> 01:15:52,401
Over in Redstone, our sister's
still waiting for you at the church.

624
01:15:55,321 --> 01:15:57,441
You planning to marry?

625
01:15:57,641 --> 01:16:00,481
- She had a boy.
- Hmm.

626
01:16:00,681 --> 01:16:03,881
Never careful, are you, Major?

627
01:16:04,841 --> 01:16:07,361
(laughs)

628
01:16:10,081 --> 01:16:12,921
If you're after something, come and get it.

629
01:16:25,241 --> 01:16:27,081
The drum.

630
01:16:27,281 --> 01:16:28,841
Open it!

631
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:35,641
Hey, skinny! You get his gun.

632
01:16:36,921 --> 01:16:38,561
Me?

633
01:16:46,521 --> 01:16:51,001
The same thing once happened to you
with the Yankees.

634
01:16:51,201 --> 01:16:53,841
But you had ideas then, eh, Major?

635
01:16:54,681 --> 01:16:56,521
Take it.

636
01:17:46,281 --> 01:17:48,681
(clanging)

637
01:18:16,361 --> 01:18:20,281
- Where'd you hide that?
- It was on me.

638
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:23,481
<i>Nobody“ trust me.</i>

639
01:18:26,761 --> 01:18:28,521
(yells)

640
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:47,561
Uh-uh. Someday...

641
01:18:48,521 --> 01:18:50,761
...you'll win at poker.

642
01:18:50,961 --> 01:18:53,401
Bronco, what's the matter?

643
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:56,521
I was thinking of your little boy.

644
01:18:56,721 --> 01:19:01,241
He'll be nobody's boy, like me, like him too.
You were fortunate, stranger.

645
01:19:01,441 --> 01:19:05,081
- You at least had a mother to look after you.
- (Whispers)

646
01:19:05,281 --> 01:19:07,481
Oh... She was?

647
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:12,121
- Guess so.
- Isn't there a good one at all?

648
01:19:19,961 --> 01:19:21,961
Come with me.

649
01:19:22,161 --> 01:19:25,361
Ever since you've been here,
there's been nothing but trouble.

650
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:29,041
He had to kill him. It was self-defense.
Honest it was.

651
01:19:34,921 --> 01:19:37,841
Let him through! Let him through! Get back.

652
01:19:38,081 --> 01:19:40,441
Come on! Stand back there.

653
01:19:40,641 --> 01:19:42,441
Stand back.

654
01:20:29,201 --> 01:20:31,681
(splashing)

655
01:20:44,081 --> 01:20:46,281
(indistinct chatter)

656
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:13,281
Here's the murder weapon, Sheriff.

657
01:21:15,521 --> 01:21:17,201
Now...

658
01:21:17,401 --> 01:21:19,801
...let's reconstruct this crime.

659
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:22,561
Sheriff.

660
01:21:22,761 --> 01:21:27,881
Pickles, Josiah Pickles, strangles Diane.

661
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:34,401
Pickles is so dangerous, he wants to kill me
too, so comes back and gets shot with my gun.

662
01:21:34,601 --> 01:21:38,561
- Now, what was the motive?
- You're very funny, Sabata.

663
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:43,281
But nobody's gonna untie
that rope necktie around your neck.

664
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:46,081
Sorry, but you're wasting your time.

665
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:49,321
Meanwhile, whoever killed Pickles
is making off with the loot.

666
01:21:49,521 --> 01:21:51,641
A million dollars that belongs to us.

667
01:21:51,881 --> 01:21:56,321
The people. For our city to grow rich
and respected too.

668
01:21:57,481 --> 01:22:00,801
Mm-mm. Bronco, never break the law.

669
01:22:07,601 --> 01:22:09,521
Wait a minute.

670
01:22:10,721 --> 01:22:13,681
You mean the funds
of the whole McIntock plan?

671
01:22:13,881 --> 01:22:17,561
Give me six hours in exchange
for a million dollars.

672
01:22:30,641 --> 01:22:33,881
- (man) The McIntock mine!
- (Woman) They discovered gold.

673
01:22:34,081 --> 01:22:35,361
Huh?

674
01:22:35,561 --> 01:22:37,841
(crowd shouting)

675
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,761
Sheriff, gold in the old mine!

676
01:22:48,961 --> 01:22:51,441
After 20 years? It's impossible!

677
01:22:51,641 --> 01:22:56,361
- There was an explosion, and it dropped out!
- I'm going down there!

678
01:22:56,561 --> 01:23:00,281
A vein in his mine? Bad news
for that old weasel McIntock.

679
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:03,841
Last month, he donated
the mine to the city.

680
01:23:07,281 --> 01:23:12,401
Tell me, stranger, what are we gonna do
with that counterfeit money?

681
01:23:12,601 --> 01:23:15,521
- Wait till you get the real ones back.
- Ah.

682
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:17,321
Ah.

683
01:23:18,321 --> 01:23:21,721
- Well, Sheriff?
- Six hours, Sabata.

684
01:23:52,801 --> 01:23:55,841
Where we're going, I don't
have a place for you.

685
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:58,521
See you in St Louis.

686
01:24:10,441 --> 01:24:12,641
Maggie.

687
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:14,961
I'll miss you.

688
01:24:48,801 --> 01:24:52,521
Sabata will follow you.
He's sure to be spying on our movements.

689
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:56,641
That's why I'm going. You better stay here.

690
01:25:02,761 --> 01:25:04,641
Go on in.

691
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:25,681
(horse whinnies)

692
01:25:40,321 --> 01:25:42,881
(laughs) I want to find that gold.

693
01:25:44,801 --> 01:25:47,121
- Where do we begin?
- At the foundry.

694
01:25:47,321 --> 01:25:50,441
(Clyde) We've got to find
it before he gets back.

695
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:13,041
Whoa.

696
01:26:13,241 --> 01:26:16,081
I don't need you.
We'll meet at Green Pass.

697
01:26:16,281 --> 01:26:21,801
- If Sabata shows up, you know what to do.
- OK. Hee-ya, hee-ya!

698
01:26:22,921 --> 01:26:24,921
HEB-ya!

699
01:26:25,761 --> 01:26:27,041
Let's go.

700
01:26:39,401 --> 01:26:43,081
I don't know, the Irish go one way,
we go another.

701
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,801
Put out that cigar.

702
01:26:48,881 --> 01:26:51,201
It's out.

703
01:26:54,441 --> 01:26:56,161
Over there.

704
01:26:58,921 --> 01:27:01,281
(gunshot)

705
01:27:01,521 --> 01:27:03,561
(horses whinny)

706
01:27:16,281 --> 01:27:17,841
(Spark ignites)

707
01:27:50,801 --> 01:27:53,441
Hey, Bronco.

708
01:27:53,641 --> 01:27:57,841
- Thought I asked you to put out that cigar.
- Oh. Mm.

709
01:28:01,601 --> 01:28:04,081
- Run for it!
- Oh!

710
01:28:19,561 --> 01:28:22,321
(horses whinny)

711
01:28:23,961 --> 01:28:28,721
Hey, stranger. See?
The cigar was out.

712
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,521
You're beaten, Sabata.

713
01:28:31,721 --> 01:28:36,161
You should have gone after the first wagon.
My gold is long gone.

714
01:28:36,361 --> 01:28:40,521
Long gone is right.
You don't trust your own men with it.

715
01:28:40,721 --> 01:28:43,361
Not even that partner of yours.

716
01:28:43,561 --> 01:28:47,001
But don't worry.
You don't owe me a thing any more.

717
01:28:48,201 --> 01:28:50,481
I don't care where my money comes from.

718
01:28:50,721 --> 01:28:56,361
The people of Hobsonville will give me ten per
cent when I give them back what you've stolen.

719
01:28:58,201 --> 01:29:00,001
You're right.

720
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:03,801
The people are always generous
to anyone who saves us.

721
01:29:04,001 --> 01:29:08,001
Ha, ha, ha. Now you just wait
till I tell them about you.

722
01:29:08,201 --> 01:29:10,441
You don't plan to tell anybody

723
01:29:10,641 --> 01:29:14,201
because you're after my gold
and want to keep it yourself.

724
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:19,881
But you're wasting your time,
because you aren't gonna find the gold.

725
01:29:21,121 --> 01:29:23,201
What do you think?

726
01:29:23,481 --> 01:29:29,201
He would die before he'd let anybody find it.
Ls it worth locating that gold?

727
01:29:29,401 --> 01:29:35,561
- Hey! Ls it worth dying for that money?
- Well, I wouldn't like to do it, Bronco.

728
01:29:44,121 --> 01:29:45,601
Clyde!

729
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:49,761
I found it! I found it!

730
01:29:52,161 --> 01:29:54,601
It was here, under the stones.

731
01:29:59,161 --> 01:30:01,121
Clyde?

732
01:30:02,321 --> 01:30:03,441
Oh!

733
01:30:03,641 --> 01:30:08,641
I'll take care of the gold. Go back
upstairs and keep your eyes open. Hurry.

734
01:30:18,801 --> 01:30:22,601
I'll get my sister, be right back.
Wait for me here.

735
01:30:27,241 --> 01:30:29,161
- (knock at door)
- (Gasps)

736
01:30:29,401 --> 01:30:33,561
- (man) The door's locked.
- (McIntock) Break it down, then.

737
01:30:46,561 --> 01:30:48,201
Clyde?

738
01:30:50,081 --> 01:30:51,641
Clyde!

739
01:30:51,881 --> 01:30:53,681
Clyde.

740
01:31:00,281 --> 01:31:03,401
Tell me how you got down here.
Gold-hunting, are you?

741
01:31:03,641 --> 01:31:06,401
- No, Joel.
- Yes, you are!

742
01:31:06,641 --> 01:31:09,041
- No.
- Turned out like everybody else.

743
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:14,481
Crawling around, sniveling like a bitch
in heat, and only to steal my gold!

744
01:31:14,681 --> 01:31:18,441
- To steal my gold!
- Help me, Clyde!

745
01:31:20,561 --> 01:31:22,401
Clyde?

746
01:31:23,601 --> 01:31:25,521
No...

747
01:31:28,521 --> 01:31:31,001
(Jackie) Clyde. Clyde, help me!

748
01:31:31,201 --> 01:31:34,801
(whimpers) No. Oh, no!

749
01:31:35,001 --> 01:31:37,921
No! Clyde!

750
01:31:41,561 --> 01:31:44,001
(footsteps)

751
01:31:50,841 --> 01:31:52,721
Jackie.

752
01:31:53,801 --> 01:31:56,841
Why did you murder my sister?

753
01:31:59,281 --> 01:32:03,241
You killed my sister.
Kill me too or you'll never get away.

754
01:32:03,441 --> 01:32:05,241
(gasps)

755
01:32:28,281 --> 01:32:30,961
Only one little sack. He's fooled us.

756
01:32:43,761 --> 01:32:46,601
All OK, Mr McIntock.

757
01:33:49,641 --> 01:33:51,401
(horse whinnies)

758
01:33:56,481 --> 01:33:58,441
Get the wagon ready.

759
01:34:56,481 --> 01:35:00,681
- The chests are in the front room.
- We just have to load up the gold.

760
01:35:00,921 --> 01:35:06,521
- Is the old man doing the right thing?
- Best thing for us is to get the hell outta here.

761
01:35:09,361 --> 01:35:11,601
I put it under these rocks.

762
01:35:11,801 --> 01:35:16,361
Just one little sack of gold
to throw them off the track and it's gone.

763
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:31,321
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

764
01:35:31,521 --> 01:35:36,001
If you wanna get money
If you wanna get rich

765
01:35:36,201 --> 01:35:39,281
If you want a good life
You gotta be a son of a...

766
01:35:39,481 --> 01:35:43,921
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

767
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:48,641
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

768
01:35:49,481 --> 01:35:52,001
Shoot the lock off. Shoot it!

769
01:36:13,761 --> 01:36:17,921
All right, men, pay attention.
Sabata and his men are around here.

770
01:36:18,161 --> 01:36:23,041
Find them and don't let them
get away alive! Understand?

771
01:36:32,041 --> 01:36:35,241
(ominous drumbeat)

772
01:37:22,481 --> 01:37:23,561
(yells)

773
01:38:12,841 --> 01:38:14,561
(gunshot)

774
01:38:24,521 --> 01:38:27,881
(whispers) 20,000 dollars and he's yours.

775
01:38:32,921 --> 01:38:35,561
Hey, partner. I want to talk to you.

776
01:38:38,281 --> 01:38:44,241
(whispers) My pistol's fully loaded
and he's fired... four rounds now.

777
01:38:49,361 --> 01:38:52,121
Sabata, I've got him.

778
01:38:53,961 --> 01:38:56,001
We've got McIntock.

779
01:39:00,841 --> 01:39:03,361
Now you judge my deal.

780
01:39:03,561 --> 01:39:05,641
He offers me 20,000.

781
01:39:05,841 --> 01:39:09,241
You offer half of ten per cent
after we find the gold.

782
01:39:09,441 --> 01:39:13,121
- But he's the only one who knows where it is.
- Ah.

783
01:39:15,201 --> 01:39:19,161
And you understand my position
about telling anybody where the gold is.

784
01:39:19,361 --> 01:39:22,961
I'd murder my own mother
before telling her.

785
01:39:38,481 --> 01:39:42,481
If that's the way it is,
let's get it over with.

786
01:39:42,681 --> 01:39:44,881
His is the better deal.

787
01:39:52,521 --> 01:39:54,561
(clicking)

788
01:39:54,801 --> 01:39:56,321
Sabata!

789
01:40:06,441 --> 01:40:09,121
- (clicking)
- You were going to rob me.

790
01:40:09,321 --> 01:40:12,321
Coming after my gold like
jackals, like hyenas.

791
01:40:12,561 --> 01:40:17,201
No! Nobody's going to get my gold.
Only I know where it is!

792
01:40:17,441 --> 01:40:20,081
All my gold's in here! (Guffaws)

793
01:40:20,321 --> 01:40:28,161
Nobody knew it. I was too smart for them,
for these Hobsonville peasants, everybody!

794
01:40:28,361 --> 01:40:31,041
- Major.
- They're dead and I've got my gold!

795
01:40:31,241 --> 01:40:33,241
(gasps)

796
01:41:18,321 --> 01:41:20,201
No!

797
01:41:20,401 --> 01:41:22,721
No, no!

798
01:41:22,921 --> 01:41:25,321
(gunshots)

799
01:41:32,161 --> 01:41:34,801
You heard what he said, Major.

800
01:41:35,001 --> 01:41:37,841
All the gold is here somewhere. But where?

801
01:41:38,041 --> 01:41:39,601
Where?

802
01:41:44,521 --> 01:41:48,521
Hallelujah, hallelujah!

803
01:41:48,721 --> 01:41:53,561
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

804
01:41:53,761 --> 01:41:56,681
Hallelujah, hallelujah!

805
01:41:56,921 --> 01:42:01,961
Hallelujah, hallelujah!

806
01:42:02,161 --> 01:42:05,081
- Hallelujah, hallelujah!
- (Laughs)

807
01:42:09,401 --> 01:42:16,281
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

808
01:42:16,521 --> 01:42:22,681
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

809
01:42:26,961 --> 01:42:28,801
Lieutenant?

810
01:42:49,201 --> 01:42:52,721
Here's your lucky piece.
Don't you want it back?

811
01:42:52,921 --> 01:42:55,361
All the cards are right here, Major.

812
01:42:56,481 --> 01:42:58,481
Mm-mm.

813
01:42:58,681 --> 01:43:02,521
You're good at cheating. But so is the house.
And I'm the house.

814
01:43:02,721 --> 01:43:06,241
And I claim a misdeal.

815
01:43:12,441 --> 01:43:13,841
Mm-hm.

816
01:43:25,401 --> 01:43:27,481
(Clyde) Pretty good, Major.

817
01:43:28,681 --> 01:43:31,521
That's right, Lieutenant. Well?

818
01:43:38,481 --> 01:43:42,121
- Pass.
- You know, stranger...

819
01:43:42,361 --> 01:43:44,761
This beats the circus number you did.

820
01:43:46,361 --> 01:43:48,801
All we lack is the music.

821
01:43:53,121 --> 01:43:55,681
(circus oom-pah brass band music)

822
01:44:02,321 --> 01:44:04,361
The show is over.

823
01:44:06,081 --> 01:44:08,481
Go ahead! Shoot!

824
01:44:24,561 --> 01:44:27,201
Your lucky piece. You won it back.

825
01:44:46,681 --> 01:44:52,441
You're leaving me here?
Aren't you taking me with you?

826
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:57,121
Major! Partner!

827
01:44:57,321 --> 01:45:00,401
Sooner or later, you're gonna need
another trigger finger.

828
01:45:00,641 --> 01:45:03,041
- Huh? Right?
- (Gunshot)

829
01:45:03,241 --> 01:45:05,721
(yells in agony) My finger!

830
01:45:05,921 --> 01:45:09,121
(Clyde yells and whimpers)

831
01:45:09,361 --> 01:45:11,801
Don't think I will.

832
01:45:12,001 --> 01:45:15,521
Aagh! Aagh! My hand!

833
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:20,801
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

834
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:26,201
Sabata, Sabata

835
01:45:26,401 --> 01:45:28,601
The fastest gun in the West

836
01:45:28,841 --> 01:45:30,761
I said. The fastest gun in the West

837
01:45:30,961 --> 01:45:36,401
Nine-fingered man. Four-barrelled derringer

838
01:45:36,641 --> 01:45:43,681
Sabata is the only invincible man
In the countryside
