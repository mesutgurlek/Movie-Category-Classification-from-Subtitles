1
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:42,860
I never figured Hal Crane would
have the nerve to string up barbed wire.

2
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:45,362
It's more than barbed wire.

3
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:49,617
It's a thousand head of my steers,
dying for feed and water.

4
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:54,668
You just have to drive your herds
across his land once a year.

5
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:57,879
You could still work out
something reasonable.

6
00:00:57,999 --> 00:00:59,592
I'm through being reasonable.

7
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:02,179
I told Crane what would happen
if he strung that wire.

8
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,047
Blaise...

9
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:07,016
We've pulled over some hard hills together

10
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,307
and I've rode behind you all the way.

11
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:14,108
A wire fence is a poor excuse
to make a widow out of Crane's wife.

12
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,188
What have you been
thinking about all winter?

13
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:23,157
Crane's barbed-wire fence
or Crane's pretty wife, Helen?

14
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:55,038
Oh, hi, strangers. It's good to see you.

15
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:57,786
- Hi, Ernine.
- Ernine.

16
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,380
Be with you in a minute, Blaise.

17
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:02,841
I didn't think you men
would get out in this weather.

18
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,798
Ernine, put up some coffee.

19
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:09,302
You boys must be eating
pretty good at your place.

20
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,266
Sure ran through that last batch
of supplies awful fast.

21
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:16,389
I didn't come to town for supplies.
I came here to get a shave.

22
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,354
Look, Blaise, these farmers
got a right to live too.

23
00:03:20,475 --> 00:03:22,148
Never saw so much stock on your shelves.

24
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,522
You're doing a pretty brisk trade
with them, Vic.

25
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,193
They're decent, hard-working folks.

26
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:28,362
All they ask out of life
is a break from the weather

27
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:31,953
and a chance to work their lands in peace.

28
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,323
Ever known me to break the peace, Vic?

29
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,745
No, but I've seen you
put away some who tried to.

30
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,878
- I don't hold for killing.
- You don't have to.

31
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:43,999
As long as you got somebody
to do it for you.

32
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,252
I'm beholden to you
for what you've done in the past

33
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:49,095
but things has changed
and we got to change with them.

34
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:51,340
I don't object to change, just fences.

35
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,892
Barbed-wire fences.

36
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:57,684
I warned Hal Crane he was foolish
for ordering that load of wire.

37
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:01,645
Still ordered it for him,
didn't you, though?

38
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:05,191
Well, a man has a right
to spend his own money as he sees fit.

39
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,861
You've declared yourself, Vic.
That's all I want to know.

40
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,234
Crane's a proud man.
He won't knuckle down.

41
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:14,329
But he's a farmer.
That gun he carries is mostly bluff.

42
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,240
You call his hand,
it will be plain murder.

43
00:04:32,547 --> 00:04:34,439
Hello, Mrs Crane.

44
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:38,061
Why, hello, Vic.

45
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:39,888
Dan.

46
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:42,558
Mr Starrett.

47
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:47,145
If you'll just give me a list,
I'll get right to it

48
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,489
so you can leave town before dark.

49
00:04:49,606 --> 00:04:52,610
We're not leaving. Hal wants to stay
overnight to settle some business.

50
00:04:52,734 --> 00:04:54,452
Coffee's on, boys.

51
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:55,866
Oh, hello, Mrs Crane.

52
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:58,365
Won't you join us
for some nice hot coffee?

53
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:01,994
Why, thanks, Ernine.
I don't know if I should.

54
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:04,291
This is the first time
we've been away in months.

55
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:07,291
I promised Mrs Preston
that we'd come over.

56
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:08,712
Come on, boys.

57
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:13,755
I make much better coffee
than that ranch mud you drink.

58
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:18,640
Go ahead. Have a nice friendly
cup of coffee the way neighbours do.

59
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,659
Won't you sit down, Mr Starrett?

60
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:40,407
You know, I'm glad your husband
is stringing up those barbed-wire fences.

61
00:05:40,532 --> 00:05:43,251
We want more farmers around here
and less cattle.

62
00:05:43,368 --> 00:05:45,962
That's not a very friendly thing
to say, Ernine.

63
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,831
Oh, I'm friendly enough, all right.

64
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:50,755
It's just that you and Blaise
are keeping me from getting married.

65
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,468
I want a husband and not some ranch hand

66
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,304
that makes $30 a month
with a bed in a bunkhouse.

67
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:59,009
I want a young farmer,
homesteading a quarter section.

68
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,930
I'm afraid Mr Starrett's more concerned
with keeping the range open

69
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:04,476
than your getting a husband.

70
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,941
You've got the best excuse I've heard yet.

71
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:08,901
Ernine, where did you put the shortening?

72
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,272
Oh, Father, just when
we were getting sociable!

73
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:12,397
Excuse me.

74
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,572
How's the winter at your place?

75
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:24,292
Oh, it's been colder and harder than most.

76
00:06:30,582 --> 00:06:32,425
Excuse me, Mrs Crane.

77
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,591
This coffee made me think
how good whiskey would taste.

78
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:37,180
Excuse me.

79
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:38,640
See you at the Wyoming.

80
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,528
Do you want to tell me something, Helen?

81
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:03,532
I don't love you anymore, Blaise.

82
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:08,833
- I want you to understand that.
- I don't.

83
00:07:08,953 --> 00:07:11,331
- Can't you see how wrong it was?
- I can see what's true.

84
00:07:11,456 --> 00:07:13,675
I don't care what's wrong or right.

85
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:16,966
Loving you has made me
a stranger in my own family.

86
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,761
It's made me feel cheap
every time Hal looks at me.

87
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:27,265
It's not a nice feeling.
It's better not to love at all.

88
00:07:27,388 --> 00:07:31,234
You met him first, you married him.
Right now you can't even remember why.

89
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:34,696
Spending the rest of your life with him,
that would be the cheap thing to do.

90
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:38,033
When Hal and I first came here,
you could have had me for the asking.

91
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,618
I'd come to a new country
with a new husband.

92
00:07:40,735 --> 00:07:43,579
I would have given up anything
if you'd only taken me then.

93
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,118
I made a mistake.

94
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,540
- I'm not proud of what we did, Blaise.
- I'm not proud I let you stay with him.

95
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:52,379
I could have been stronger with your help.

96
00:07:52,497 --> 00:07:55,467
I'm only concerned
with what's going to be.

97
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,712
We're going to meet in town
once or twice a year.

98
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:03,718
I'm going to call you Mr Starrett
and you're going to call me Mrs Crane.

99
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:05,765
That's what has to be.

100
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,887
That's easy to say,

101
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:09,639
not so easy to do.

102
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:15,146
I was more lonely this winter
than I've ever been before.

103
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:18,197
But I had time to think.

104
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,652
I'm gonna be Hal Crane's wife forever.

105
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,579
I'm sorry you had to say that, Helen.

106
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:29,747
Everything has to be
on Blaise Starrett's terms.

107
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:31,996
You don't want the farmers
to fence their farms.

108
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,169
You back your orders with guns.
You want another man's wife

109
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,713
but the man has to be dead
before you'll take her.

110
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:42,134
You don't have much mercy, do you, Blaise?

111
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:47,477
You won't find much mercy
anywhere in Wyoming.

112
00:08:58,354 --> 00:08:59,355
(DOOR CLOSES)

113
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,913
Funny weather we're having.

114
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:14,083
If that warm wind keeps blowing,
the road will be belly-deep in mud.

115
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,253
You might have to stay in town a few days.

116
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:19,250
I wouldn't count on that.

117
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:21,802
Hey, George.

118
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:25,048
My horse seems
to be favouring her left foreleg.

119
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,517
Give it a good rub-down
before you turn in tonight.

120
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,807
You might not be needing a horse tomorrow.

121
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:42,156
He's coming.

122
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,543
I see you brought the kerosene.

123
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,889
Five gallons, like you ordered.

124
00:10:06,673 --> 00:10:08,516
We've been having a meeting.

125
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:12,641
- Doesn't look like a prayer meeting.
- It wasn't.

126
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:14,935
I'm speaking for all present, Blaise.

127
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:17,479
We're not going to stand
for any gun play in Bitters.

128
00:10:18,726 --> 00:10:20,899
I won't start it, Vic.

129
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,739
I'd like that tin of kerosene back,
Blaise.

130
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:30,906
- Didn't you pay for it?
- It's paid for.

131
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,158
Take good care of it.

132
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,661
I'd like to have a word
with you, Mr Starrett.

133
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,798
You must have passed my wagon
on your way in.

134
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:41,916
I did.

135
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,794
Soon as the road's in shape
I'm moving that wire up to my place.

136
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,716
- And I'm stringing it up.
- That's what I thought it was for.

137
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:52,640
HAL: What do you intend to do about it?

138
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:55,471
It's going to be cold
riding home tomorrow.

139
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:57,473
I thought it'd be nice
to stop and make a fire.

140
00:10:57,598 --> 00:11:00,442
I hear kerosene is the fastest way
to burn up a wagon.

141
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,858
- HAL: You burn my wagons and I'll...
- Hal...

142
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:03,980
Hal.

143
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:08,192
Please.

144
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:11,321
HAL: What do you intend to do about it?

145
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:13,790
I intend to go upstairs
and get a good night's sleep.

146
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,284
I asked you a question, Mr Starrett.

147
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,252
BLAISE:
When I wake up I'll know what to do.

148
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:20,042
- I usually do.
- I've got to know.

149
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:24,543
You want to know the future, Mr Crane.
That's wanting too much for any man.

150
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:27,799
I'm not afraid of you, Starrett.

151
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:32,387
Mr Starrett and I have
some business to discuss.

152
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:34,761
Would you excuse us, please?

153
00:11:34,886 --> 00:11:37,639
I'm sure Mr Starrett doesn't object
to my presence here.

154
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,809
Mrs Crane being with you
doesn't influence me.

155
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,229
I'll fight for what I believe,
Mr Starrett.

156
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:48,404
I'll die if I have to but I'll fight.
I want you to know that.

157
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:52,161
You've got a big mouth, farmer.

158
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,740
You got big eyes too.

159
00:11:57,408 --> 00:11:59,877
You came here a year ago
in your broken-down wagon,

160
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:01,871
looking for a choice spot to settle.

161
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:05,000
And you think you found it.

162
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:09,091
But you never stopped to think
what made it such a good place.

163
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:12,924
When Dan and I came here

164
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,263
Bitters was the nesting spot

165
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:17,638
for every thief and killer
in the territory.

166
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:21,516
A man's life wasn't worth
the price of a bullet.

167
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:26,108
No woman was safe in the streets,
let alone in a lonely farmhouse.

168
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:30,487
It took more than a big mouth
to get rid of the lice

169
00:12:30,608 --> 00:12:33,578
who infested every bend of the road
you ride so safely on.

170
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:37,240
I'm not saying Dan and I did it alone.

171
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,372
But we did more than our share.

172
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,913
We hunted them down in the freezing cold

173
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:47,633
while you sat back in the east,
hugging your pot-bellied stoves.

174
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:50,757
Nobody thanked us. Nobody paid us.

175
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,467
We did it because we felt we belonged.
We'd earned the right to belong.

176
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,521
And all you've done is ride in here
and put down your stinking roots.

177
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:04,188
And now you tell us
that you belong and we don't.

178
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:08,029
Mr Crane,

179
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:10,194
you said you'd fight
to keep what you wanted.

180
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:14,869
Well, I've been doing that for 20 years
and I intend to keep on doing it.

181
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,199
And no pig-bellied farmer's
going to stop me.

182
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,317
Give me a bottle, Tom.

183
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,843
Don't kill my husband.

184
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:16,259
He intends to kill me.

185
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,678
Hal's never fired a pistol
in his whole life.

186
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,346
Then he shouldn't wear one.

187
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:23,062
He's not a coward.
He won't beg for his life.

188
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,309
I'm not that courageous. I do beg you.

189
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:30,816
You should be telling this to him.

190
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,314
I have.

191
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,816
- He won't listen.
- What made you think I would?

192
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,569
Do you want me, Blaise?

193
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:42,616
Do you want me
to ride out to your ranch with you?

194
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,004
I'm offering myself to you,

195
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,964
on any terms you want, but leave Hal live.

196
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,089
Your husband's a stubborn man.

197
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:57,888
He won't give up his fences.
Why should he give you up?

198
00:14:58,005 --> 00:14:59,928
I'll tell him I no longer love him.

199
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:01,722
He'll only come after you.

200
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:03,719
It'll still have to end the same way.

201
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:08,726
You're not a cruel man.
I've been close enough to you to know.

202
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:10,851
Why must you act like one?

203
00:15:11,852 --> 00:15:14,605
Because I can't feel sorry
for someone I hate.

204
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:19,618
Do you hate me too, Blaise?

205
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:43,885
Tell your husband to load up his wagons
and take you out of Wyoming.

206
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,645
Don't you think I've tried?

207
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:51,813
I knew this was coming.

208
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:53,982
I've waited all winter long for this day.

209
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:59,025
You have to do it, Helen.
Make him take you away.

210
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,495
He's afraid of you
but he's not a weak man.

211
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:04,239
He'll die before he'll run.

212
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:13,589
Then that's the way it'll have to be.

213
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:20,255
I'm sorry to have troubled you,
Mr Starrett.

214
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,050
Dan?

215
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:30,101
I'm no good to you, Blaise.
I'm no good to you.

216
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,643
Hold it.

217
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:36,892
Don't touch that kerosene.

218
00:18:37,808 --> 00:18:39,526
We want you to go home.

219
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:43,193
There are three of us.

220
00:18:57,787 --> 00:18:58,788
Dan.

221
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,540
Dan!

222
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:05,924
Roll the bottle down the bar.

223
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:10,303
When it hits the floor, that's it.

224
00:19:12,343 --> 00:19:13,765
Roll the bottle, Dan.

225
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,043
Anything we can do for you strangers?

226
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:43,586
Yes, could be.

227
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:48,045
I was looking for a quiet place.

228
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,224
We were settling a little private quarrel.

229
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:53,809
I apologise.

230
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:56,937
I don't like to break in on a party.

231
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,437
But we'll take your guns.

232
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:02,652
You won't find anything to take
in this town.

233
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,816
You'd be surprised
at what we can find to take.

234
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,190
Trail ends in this town.

235
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:09,442
No place to go but back.

236
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,285
The trail back is closed.

237
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,496
Who's following you?

238
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:19,042
- Cavalry.
- Two days' hard riding behind us.

239
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:22,038
Cavalry doesn't bother
tracking seven men like you.

240
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:26,876
Captain Jack Bruhn,

241
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,628
United States Army,

242
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:30,345
formerly.

243
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,224
BRUHN: Hey, you.

244
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,684
I want food and service for my men.

245
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,519
- We'll pay.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,105
That cavalry won't stop for food and rest.

247
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,017
My men rest.

248
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,948
Now, listen, do as you're told

249
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:56,572
and you can go about your business
just like we're not here,

250
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:58,415
almost.

251
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:01,752
But we are here so it's best you know
with what you're dealing.

252
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:07,253
Pace here, he derives pleasure
out of hurting people.

253
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:11,629
Tex, rile him and you're gonna hear
some screaming in this town today.

254
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:14,924
Denver,

255
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,551
half Cheyenne.

256
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,595
Him hate white men

257
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,769
but he doesn't feel half so badly
about white women.

258
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,142
Vause,

259
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,986
bones covered with dirty skin
but even half-drunk

260
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:31,824
he's the fastest draw
in Wyoming territory.

261
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:32,942
Shorty,

262
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,825
we soldiered together.

263
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:42,710
The young fella, he's a fresh recruit
but he's learning fast.

264
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:45,454
I believe you.
You just killed a man for no reason.

265
00:21:47,748 --> 00:21:49,546
There will be no more killing

266
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,544
and to make sure,

267
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:53,842
Denver, Vause,

268
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:57,183
take that drunk
and round up every gun in town

269
00:21:58,467 --> 00:21:59,889
and destroy them.

270
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:05,058
And don't waste time arguing with anybody.

271
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:08,352
How many people live around here?

272
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:10,400
About 20.

273
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:13,024
- Who's the law?
- We handle our own law.

274
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,735
Not now.

275
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,862
Let's get started, Bruhn.

276
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,662
We can do whatever we want in this town.

277
00:22:21,782 --> 00:22:24,080
I'm edgy to get doing.

278
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:28,627
Where do you hide your women around here?

279
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,590
Leave our women out of this.

280
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,381
We only want to borrow 'em.

281
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,220
TEX: We'll give 'em back.

282
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:39,099
No women.

283
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,854
And no whiskey and no gunning.

284
00:22:45,806 --> 00:22:49,652
With 40,000 in gold in our saddlebags
and a long ride ahead?

285
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,653
We'll pleasure ourselves
at the end of the trail.

286
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,952
It's gonna be a long day, Captain.

287
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:03,574
You wanna argue, Pace?

288
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:06,373
No, just reminding you.

289
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:08,663
I gotta have a drink.

290
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,790
One.

291
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:18,138
I'd like one,
but it's the order of the day.

292
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,851
Is there a doctor in this town?

293
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,936
BLAISE: Doc Langer.

294
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,852
Vet, back of the barbershop.

295
00:23:35,564 --> 00:23:38,534
BRUHN: Can this horse doctor
take out a bullet slug?

296
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,903
- BLAISE: He has.
- (BOTH SNIGGER)

297
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:52,922
BRUHN: Freeze it, Pace.

298
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:58,633
You seem to think a lot
of your women in this town.

299
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:00,923
Who does she belong to?

300
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,264
She's my wife.

301
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:18,111
Change your mind about no women, Captain?

302
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:19,825
There are only four women in this town.

303
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:21,990
Do you want your men
killing each other over them?

304
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:25,080
Tex, Pace...

305
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:28,326
Search upstairs.
Bring anybody you find down here.

306
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:35,249
Shorty,

307
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,251
take these two to the store.

308
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,879
Then round up all the women
and put 'em in the store

309
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:42,597
and tell 'em to get inside
and stay inside.

310
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:48,437
My wife is upstairs.

311
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:53,560
My men won't molest your women
unless I give them permission.

312
00:24:53,684 --> 00:24:55,186
(SHRIEKING)

313
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,740
- We found one more.
- Get down here!

314
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,544
Lady, you go to the store
with the rest of the women.

315
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:23,427
Hey, you. I told you
to prepare the rations.

316
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:24,969
Now, get going.

317
00:25:33,182 --> 00:25:35,605
We've been riding hard
for over a month, Captain.

318
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,314
Hey!

319
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:43,443
Hide your liquor and hide it good.

320
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:45,365
(COUGHING)

321
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,459
Now... let's go see that horse doctor.

322
00:25:57,164 --> 00:26:00,293
When the boys come back, keep them here.

323
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:02,840
No man leaves this saloon till I return.

324
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:05,635
And no whiskey.

325
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,467
That's an order.

326
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,389
- You handle your men well, Captain.
- They need me.

327
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:20,191
Come along with me.

328
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,736
That bullet's way in deep.
I don't see how he's still walking around.

329
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,776
- Has he got a chance?
- If he was a horse or a cow, I'd know.

330
00:27:03,897 --> 00:27:06,571
I just ain't had too much practice
on humans.

331
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:09,821
It says that a person with a deep wound
can die of internal bleeding

332
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:11,993
even though nothing shows on the outside.

333
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:14,663
- Is he bleeding internally?
- I couldn't tell.

334
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:18,662
Do you want me to kill him?

335
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:21,707
Kill him?

336
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:26,466
If Bruhn dies, this town gets torn apart.

337
00:27:26,586 --> 00:27:29,055
They'll go after you first.
You got to keep him alive.

338
00:27:29,172 --> 00:27:30,424
But how?

339
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,519
Look, I don't know how. I can't operate.
I haven't got the instruments.

340
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:36,354
- I wouldn't know how to use them.
- You're gonna operate.

341
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:41,776
What are you two talking about?

342
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:48,196
The Captain's waiting
for you to take the bullet out, Doc.

343
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:50,240
He's waiting for the water to boil.

344
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,456
If Bruhn dies, I'll kill you.

345
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:23,735
What are we waiting for?

346
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:24,899
Sit down.

347
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,873
You'd better have some of this.

348
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,630
Put it away.

349
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,837
Hide the liquor.

350
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:28,546
BRUHN: Mr Starrett, talk to me.

351
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,388
What about?

352
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,095
Anything, Mr Starrett.

353
00:29:42,222 --> 00:29:43,519
Anything.

354
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:01,867
BLAISE: Where did you serve
in the cavalry, Captain?

355
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,832
Why do you ask?

356
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:09,083
I remember hearing about a Captain Bruhn.

357
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:14,047
Some incident with the Mormons in Utah.
I just wondered if you were the same.

358
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:16,674
DOC: Would you help me, please?

359
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,762
What did you hear?

360
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,052
BLAISE: No.

361
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,101
Couldn't be you.

362
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,483
Yes, it was.

363
00:30:49,998 --> 00:30:53,047
BRUHN: Strange, how one word
can change a man's life.

364
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:57,089
I could have ordered, "Retreat!"

365
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,426
My command was, "Fire!"

366
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:29,671
At West Point I made up my mind
to be all soldier,

367
00:31:31,581 --> 00:31:35,427
which doesn't leave much room
for being human.

368
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:42,972
Thanks.

369
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:33,735
Keep your people in check.
I'll control my men.

370
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:44,654
Gene,

371
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:47,453
stay with me.

372
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:53,625
I'm sleepy.

373
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,857
What are his chances, Doc?

374
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:21,358
I don't know.

375
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,953
It was in real deep.

376
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,913
I'd say if he lasts through the night...

377
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:30,208
I just don't know.

378
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:44,673
Shorty.

379
00:33:52,055 --> 00:33:53,728
I found a bottle in the barbershop.

380
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:55,896
The Captain says no whiskey.

381
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:58,645
- He'll never know.
- He knows everything.

382
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:02,449
They'd have hung you back in Casper
if it hadn't been for Captain Bruhn.

383
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:04,408
And I'd have been an old bum in Adeline.

384
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,832
I wish you hadn't busted
the bottle, Shorty.

385
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,542
We could have had just one drink.

386
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,287
Did you ever see what the Captain does
to men that disobey?

387
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:21,127
- I've never seen anybody disobey him.
- I have.

388
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:23,003
Be glad I busted that bottle.

389
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:28,008
I'll get it.

390
00:34:30,218 --> 00:34:33,643
It's a relief to see
you and Mr Starrett friendly again.

391
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:36,016
Mr Preston and I were so worried.

392
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:38,644
That's all over, isn't it, Mr Starrett?

393
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:40,816
Doesn't seem very important right now.

394
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:46,576
- Hal and you can be good friends.
- Yes, we might try it sometime.

395
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:48,912
What Blaise needs
is a wife to steady him down.

396
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,078
Clagget stole a horse from 'em.

397
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,418
He's just saddling up.
He's gonna make a run for it.

398
00:34:55,535 --> 00:34:57,537
He's crazy. He'll never make it.

399
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,666
- He knows they're watching the road.
- Keep the women inside.

400
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:05,545
Clagget, hold it.

401
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,298
My wife's alone at the farm.
I got to go to her.

402
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:10,926
You can't get through.
They got a man watching the road.

403
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,472
I'll get through.

404
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:31,116
(GUNSHOT)

405
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,301
Bruhn is dying.

406
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,135
I saw him a little while ago.

407
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:30,472
He looks strong and healthy.

408
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,215
He might not last the day.

409
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,219
- What will happen if he dies?
- They'll start drinking and fighting.

410
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:39,098
- I've got to get Tommy out of that place.
- No, you can't help him. You better stay.

411
00:36:40,557 --> 00:36:44,187
- They'll be here too, soon enough.
- They mustn't find you here.

412
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,233
ERNINE: Where can we hide in town?

413
00:36:46,354 --> 00:36:50,154
DAN: Beats me. Even if we had horses
you couldn't get away through the snow.

414
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:51,902
The ladies will have to walk.

415
00:37:00,326 --> 00:37:01,794
Get back to town.

416
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:05,460
Get out of here.

417
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:09,002
Gene.

418
00:37:10,086 --> 00:37:12,088
That's your name, isn't it?

419
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:13,840
Don't make me use this gun.

420
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,851
I don't think you ever shot anybody.

421
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:20,897
I could start with you. What do you want?

422
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:24,271
Let those women go by.

423
00:37:25,894 --> 00:37:27,316
I can't do that.

424
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:31,824
They're coming. Are you gonna shoot them?

425
00:37:31,941 --> 00:37:34,069
I can't cross Bruhn. I got to warn him.

426
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:36,992
No. I don't think you want
those women to get hurt.

427
00:37:37,113 --> 00:37:39,912
I don't think Bruhn wants it either.

428
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:42,286
Only Tex and Pace want it.
You gonna do it for them?

429
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,457
(GUNFIRE)

430
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:02,309
- Why didn't you stop 'em?
- GENE: I was trying to.

431
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:14,613
Go back to town.

432
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:41,595
BRUHN:
I told you your women would be safe.

433
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:45,398
All you had to do was wait.
Why didn't you believe me?

434
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:51,612
You've got all the cards, Bruhn.
Go ahead and play.

435
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:55,237
Only don't take it out on them.
It was my idea.

436
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:58,366
I'm gonna have some fun
with them now, Jack.

437
00:38:58,486 --> 00:38:59,738
The name is Bruhn.

438
00:38:59,862 --> 00:39:02,160
Ain't no reason
to give 'em a break now, Bruhn.

439
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,876
- I put my claim on that one first.
- I'm gonna make the little one happy.

440
00:39:09,539 --> 00:39:11,758
You won't turn your men loose, Bruhn.

441
00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:15,128
Why not? They wanna get drunk.
They wanna have some fun.

442
00:39:19,215 --> 00:39:23,345
They could swallow this town whole
and nobody would be alive to tell the tale.

443
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:26,226
You won't let that happen.

444
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,986
- Say the word, Captain.
- I'll toss you for the pleasure.

445
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,697
Mr Blaise, you broke your word.

446
00:39:34,814 --> 00:39:37,818
Only because I don't believe
you can hold your men.

447
00:39:40,403 --> 00:39:42,656
Tex, put down the gun.

448
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:50,497
Go back to your homes, everybody.
Stay on the inside.

449
00:39:55,835 --> 00:39:58,714
You, stay here.

450
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,562
He's all yours, Texas.

451
00:40:10,683 --> 00:40:11,730
No gun.

452
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:20,235
(LAUGHTER)

453
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:30,378
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

454
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:39,554
(LAUGHTER CONTINUES)

455
00:40:48,554 --> 00:40:51,398
Thought you'd make yourself
a big man in this town, huh?

456
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:08,180
Vause, Denver,

457
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:09,723
finish him.

458
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:14,811
With your fists.

459
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,816
BRUHN: Shorty,

460
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:02,564
bring that boy.

461
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,658
- SHORTY: Come here, sonny.
- VIC: What do you want him for?

462
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:10,322
BRUHN: He comes with me.

463
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:13,579
Your friends will sacrifice you

464
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:16,669
but they won't cause
a young boy to be hurt

465
00:43:16,786 --> 00:43:18,413
by acting foolish.

466
00:43:48,317 --> 00:43:50,740
Don't worry about the boy.

467
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:52,704
I'll take care of him.

468
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:55,036
I promise.

469
00:43:56,117 --> 00:43:57,539
Now, go on back.

470
00:43:58,494 --> 00:43:59,586
Please.

471
00:44:24,186 --> 00:44:26,484
He'll be leaving as soon as it's daybreak.

472
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:28,941
Sure.

473
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:32,953
Bruhn seems to be getting better.

474
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,788
They're staying close to the Wyoming.

475
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,241
Good.

476
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:41,542
Hal is grateful for what you did.

477
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:43,005
Deeply grateful.

478
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:46,217
Go back to him.

479
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:49,887
I told him I was coming here.

480
00:44:50,004 --> 00:44:51,756
I asked him to come with me.

481
00:44:53,466 --> 00:44:55,139
But he told me to come alone.

482
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,144
I believe he knows and understands.

483
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,727
What's to understand?

484
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,904
You're his wife, I'm a stranger.

485
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:12,152
Go back to your husband, Mrs Crane.

486
00:45:15,488 --> 00:45:16,910
Thank you, Blaise.

487
00:45:19,241 --> 00:45:20,959
Thanks for understanding.

488
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,099
- You mustn't come in here.
- I've got to see Bobby.

489
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:37,435
He's all right.
This is no place for you to be.

490
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:40,141
Please.

491
00:45:40,262 --> 00:45:42,185
Go home.

492
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,183
I wanna see Bobby first.

493
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,981
BOBBY: Please don't. Ow! No, no!

494
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:51,608
- Ow!
- Say you'll do it

495
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:53,575
or I'll break your little arm.

496
00:45:54,652 --> 00:45:56,120
No, no. Please don't. Ow!

497
00:45:56,237 --> 00:45:58,831
- Let the kid go, Pace.
- Bruhn's got the whiskey here.

498
00:45:58,948 --> 00:46:01,121
I want the kid to find out where it is
and get a bottle.

499
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:03,586
If you want a drink, ask Bruhn.

500
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:06,080
Are you giving orders now?

501
00:46:06,205 --> 00:46:07,627
In this case I am.

502
00:46:26,225 --> 00:46:30,196
Forget it, Gene. We're all getting jumpy
from not having any liquor or fun.

503
00:46:32,565 --> 00:46:35,034
When he cools off, give him his gun back.

504
00:46:35,151 --> 00:46:37,119
(SNORING)

505
00:46:49,165 --> 00:46:51,259
Get out of here, Ernine.

506
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,343
I'm taking him with me.

507
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:55,971
Stop.

508
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:01,135
Look, I'm sorry. You can't do that.

509
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,228
She hasn't done anything. Don't hurt her.

510
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:04,767
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.

511
00:47:06,182 --> 00:47:07,684
He's all right.

512
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,311
He's as rotten as the rest of them.

513
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:13,106
You shouldn't have come here.

514
00:47:14,482 --> 00:47:16,075
I'm taking Bobby back with me.

515
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:19,822
That'll just make things worse.
The boy's got to stay.

516
00:47:19,945 --> 00:47:23,165
I saw what happened.
I heard him screaming.

517
00:47:23,282 --> 00:47:25,205
It won't happen again.
The boy has to stay.

518
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,829
There's no other way, Ernine.

519
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:41,801
How do you do, Miss?

520
00:47:46,388 --> 00:47:48,390
She was worried about her brother.

521
00:47:49,808 --> 00:47:50,855
She's leaving.

522
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,406
No need to be.

523
00:47:56,524 --> 00:47:58,117
What's your name, Miss?

524
00:47:58,234 --> 00:47:59,986
Bruhn said to leave the women alone, Pace.

525
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,455
I didn't bring her.
She's here because she wanted to be.

526
00:48:03,572 --> 00:48:06,200
- That gives me certain privileges.
- Freeze, Pace!

527
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:25,887
This sure is a night for tangling.

528
00:48:29,765 --> 00:48:31,267
I got a better idea.

529
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,312
Let's toss a coin for her.

530
00:48:35,938 --> 00:48:36,939
Leave.

531
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,743
Bobby, tell your sister to leave.

532
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,368
Go ahead. I'll be all right.

533
00:48:58,752 --> 00:49:01,050
You didn't have
to pull that iron on me, Gene.

534
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,975
I'm your friend.

535
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,137
We ride together, don't we?

536
00:49:09,263 --> 00:49:10,936
Sure, Pace.

537
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:12,933
We ride together.

538
00:49:13,058 --> 00:49:14,435
We're friends.

539
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:28,331
Would you like a cup of coffee?

540
00:49:29,658 --> 00:49:30,705
Yeah, thanks.

541
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:40,969
I'm worried about Bruhn, Doc.

542
00:49:41,086 --> 00:49:43,180
- How is he?
- Coming along.

543
00:49:48,761 --> 00:49:52,766
He ain't hurt bad, is he, Doc?
Not like dying?

544
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,439
- You don't want him to die, do you?
- No, of course not.

545
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,898
He never answered you.

546
00:50:01,023 --> 00:50:02,650
I tell you, Tex...

547
00:50:06,862 --> 00:50:09,115
there's something really wrong with Bruhn.

548
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,082
There is?

549
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,588
- What?
- TEX: You sure look fine, Bruhn.

550
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:20,919
- Where's that little boy?
- PACE: In the kitchen with Gene.

551
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:24,926
I don't want that boy
harmed or frightened.

552
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:26,469
We all like the kid, Bruhn.

553
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:28,467
I want the boy with Gene.

554
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:30,845
How about breaking open a bottle,
just one drink?

555
00:50:30,969 --> 00:50:33,017
I'm getting a chill. Just one drink.

556
00:50:34,473 --> 00:50:37,101
I want every man cold sober.

557
00:50:37,226 --> 00:50:39,103
We pull out of here at dawn.

(WIND HOWLING)

559
00:50:46,485 --> 00:50:50,706
We don't ride tomorrow or the day after.
Did you see the weather coming in?

560
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,761
My tongue's salt-dry for whiskey.

561
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:08,512
We took that army pay wagon,

562
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:11,556
fought hard, shot our way out.

563
00:51:11,677 --> 00:51:13,429
For what?

564
00:51:13,554 --> 00:51:17,104
Sitting around on our butts
like this was Sunday school!

565
00:51:23,856 --> 00:51:27,030
Captain, you ain't letting
nature take its course.

566
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:29,745
Men don't act like you make us act here.

567
00:51:29,862 --> 00:51:32,741
We've got this town under our thumb
but we ain't getting no pleasure.

568
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:36,620
Two more days like this
is gonna seem like two more years.

569
00:51:36,744 --> 00:51:39,748
Maybe not even you
can keep us in line, Bruhn.

570
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,633
I gave my word to the people of this town.

571
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:47,130
Why did you?
To make you look big and us little?

572
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:49,803
Maybe you better answer, Bruhn.

573
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:57,731
You'll drink, fool around,
then kill each other over these women.

574
00:51:59,475 --> 00:52:03,070
I'm a-riding out of here
at daybreak with six men.

It's Saturday night.
Invite the ladies over for a social.

576
00:52:07,816 --> 00:52:10,911
There's no harm in coffee and cookies
and a little dancing.

577
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:13,827
- It'll take the edge off for a while.
- Yeah.

578
00:52:13,947 --> 00:52:17,076
And all I'd like is a chance
to talk to that little girl.

579
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:19,920
I won't even ask her to dance
if she don't want to.

580
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:23,541
With no liquor
it'll be a quiet Saturday night.

581
00:52:23,665 --> 00:52:25,667

One dance and I get her back.

00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,863
If I was drunk
I'd really show you how to dance.

587
00:53:32,985 --> 00:53:35,408
Maybe Bruhn will open up
the whiskey pretty soon.

588
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:40,417
I won't let Pace touch you.

I came with them, I'm one of them.

593
00:53:51,545 --> 00:53:54,765
I said I wouldn't let Pace touch you
but you don't have to dance with me.

this terrible thing?

There are things worse, Ma'am,
than dancing with lonely men.

- Please let us go.
- Soon.

- Having a good time, gentlemen?
- Yeah.

How long can Bruhn live?

617
00:57:24,591 --> 00:57:27,060
Well, I gave him a big shot of morphine.

618
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:30,681
It deadens pain,
makes the patient feel fine.

619
00:57:30,806 --> 00:57:33,309
As soon as that dose wears off,
he's gonna start coughing.

620
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:35,686
The cough's gonna rip the lungs
a little bit more.

621
00:57:36,937 --> 00:57:39,315
A few hours after he starts coughing
he's gonna die.

Nothing, just talking.

00:58:27,863 --> 00:58:30,582
looks like you'll get what you wanted
without doing a thing.

632
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:31,176
BLAISE: Hold it, that's enough.

(MUSIC STOPS)

634
00:59:32,636 --> 00:59:34,229
Are you giving the orders now?

635
00:59:34,346 --> 00:59:35,347
No.

636
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:39,893
You don't know about the weather
up in these mountains.

637
00:59:41,478 --> 00:59:44,573
It's storming up here
but not down in the valley below.

638
00:59:44,689 --> 00:59:46,612
You came here to talk about the weather?

639
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:51,033
Those soldiers you think are days
behind you are riding over the trail

640
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,452
and they're heading this way.

641
00:59:53,573 --> 00:59:57,453
Your concern for my men and me,
Mr Blaise, is very touching.

642
00:59:57,577 --> 00:59:59,671
Your position is hardly a tactical one.

643
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,503
You can't fight those soldiers here.

644
01:00:02,624 --> 01:00:04,626
Even a private
would realise that, Captain.

645
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:11,637
Can you suggest an alternative?

646
01:00:11,758 --> 01:00:13,431
Yes, if you stop this party.

647
01:00:14,594 --> 01:00:16,972
There's another way through the mountains.

648
01:00:17,097 --> 01:00:19,065
No trail, no pass, but there's a way.

649
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,524
- I've been through it.
- He's lying.

650
01:00:24,729 --> 01:00:27,323
Why didn't you take your women
that way this morning?

651
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,987
It's too rough for the women.

652
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:33,163
Might be too rough for some of your men.

653
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,580
He's lying. I tell you, Bruhn, he's lying.

654
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:45,717
I'll find out.

655
01:00:48,086 --> 01:00:50,339
You ride with us, lead the way.

(WIND HOWLING)

657
01:00:57,846 --> 01:00:59,974
You couldn't find it without me.

658

Shorty...

659
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:18,704
Pack your gear and assemble the men.
We're moving out at daybreak.

660

We'll be gone in a few minutes.

665
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:36,220
Can I get you something? Some tobacco?

666
01:03:36,337 --> 01:03:38,180
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

667
01:03:41,509 --> 01:03:43,136
I'll always remember you.

668
01:03:45,597 --> 01:03:46,974
Goodbye, Gene.

Goodbye, Ernine.

You mustn't go with them.

01:04:02,989 --> 01:04:04,332
I have to.

672
01:04:06,951 --> 01:04:08,953
I might come back later but I have to.

673
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:12,082
If you go, you'll never come back.
There's no way through that mountain.

674
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:53,672
Blaise.

675
01:05:12,225 --> 01:05:14,227
There is no trail to Cheyenne.

676
01:05:14,352 --> 01:05:15,979
I never said there was a trail.

677
01:05:17,438 --> 01:05:19,065
I said there was a way through.

678
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:21,693
Stop manoeuvring. There's no way.

679
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:23,195
Kill him.

680
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:24,571
Wait, Gene.

681
01:05:34,289 --> 01:05:36,087
I'd like you to know why I lied to you.

682
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:38,418
I'm not interested.

683
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:40,045
You're a dying man, Bruhn.

684
01:05:41,212 --> 01:05:42,680
That interest you?

685
01:05:42,797 --> 01:05:44,219
How do you want to die?

686
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:47,810
You're a man, not an animal.

687
01:05:49,554 --> 01:05:52,103
You can ride out here with me
and die clean,

688
01:05:52,223 --> 01:05:56,273
or turn your men loose on this town
and die like a pig in the mud.

689
01:05:56,394 --> 01:05:58,237
Do you want another Mormon massacre?

How do you want to go, Bruhn?

692
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:17,374
Ernine told you there was no trail.

693
01:06:17,498 --> 01:06:20,593
- I didn't say who told me.
- Ernine must like you.

694
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,429
Have you any idea what Pace
will do to her when Bruhn dies?

695
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,344
- I can stop him.
- Are you sure?

696
01:06:25,465 --> 01:06:26,967
I won't be here to help you, son.

Just a minute.

699
01:06:42,982 --> 01:06:44,780
I know what I'm doing

700
01:06:44,901 --> 01:06:46,699
and I know what Gene's doing.

701
01:06:48,029 --> 01:06:51,078
But you, what's your reason?

702
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:53,873
- Why do you want to die?
- I know what I'm doing too, Bruhn.

703
01:06:56,954 --> 01:06:58,376
Let's leave it at that.

704

I guess every fool has his reason.

705
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:40,210
Ernine spoke the truth.

706
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:42,629
- There is no way across the mountain.
- Who knows?

707
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:46,922
Maybe I'll find a trail.

708
01:07:47,046 --> 01:07:48,889
I'm not even sure they're going.

709
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:52,143
But if they do go,
you know you won't come back.

710
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,432
Probably not.

711
01:07:56,723 --> 01:07:58,316
Why are you doing this?

712
01:07:58,433 --> 01:08:00,731
I'm not doing anything special.

713
01:08:00,852 --> 01:08:03,480
I'm just taking some bad men
out of a good town.

714
01:08:03,604 --> 01:08:05,652
You're the same man
who would have killed Hal.

715

I don't know you at all.

716
01:08:09,569 --> 01:08:10,991
No reason to.

717
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:16,080
Are you doing it because of me?

718
01:08:17,452 --> 01:08:19,295
I'd like to know, Blaise.

719
01:08:19,787 --> 01:08:22,131
I'm doing it because of myself.

720
01:08:22,248 --> 01:08:25,843
That night in my room in the Wyoming
you asked me not to kill your husband

721
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,088
and I took a good look
at myself in the mirror.

722
01:08:28,212 --> 01:08:30,340
I didn't like what I saw.

723
01:08:30,465 --> 01:08:34,015
I'm not any different from the men
who rode in and took over this town,

724
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:36,479
only they don't pretend to be
anything but what they are.

725
01:08:41,476 --> 01:08:43,524
And that's all there is to it, Mrs Crane.

726

Let's move.

727
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:24,097
Ah, I feel better now.

728
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,234
I'm beginning to hope we're gonna make it.

729
01:11:30,978 --> 01:11:32,821
None of us are gonna make it.

Hey, Blaise,
how are we gonna get out of this?

(WHINNYING)

732
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,893
I'm gonna need me another horse.

733
01:14:17,103 --> 01:14:18,980
Ride one of the pack horses.

734
01:14:26,112 --> 01:14:29,116
Gene, get off your horse.

735
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:41,464
Bruhn said get down.

736
01:14:44,421 --> 01:14:47,641
And I'm saying
leave your saddlebags where they are.

737
01:14:47,758 --> 01:14:49,180
There's 6,000 in gold in 'em.

738
01:14:49,301 --> 01:14:51,303
You can't carry it anyway. Get down.

739
01:14:56,934 --> 01:14:58,732
Just follow the tracks.

740
01:14:58,853 --> 01:15:01,857
If snow covers them, keep the wind
at your back. You'll be all right.

01:15:02,815 --> 01:15:03,862
Down!

You won't be needing that gun.

till the Captain can ride again.

What are you thanking him for?
Get on your horse.

We're gonna stop and bury these two men.

You know,
it's kind of a lucky ride after all.

Lucky?

763
01:19:33,794 --> 01:19:37,469
Yup. We started out
with about 6,000 in gold apiece.

764
01:19:39,299 --> 01:19:42,018
Now we got 18,000 more to split four ways.

Not much.

There's nothing to see.

772
01:20:37,524 --> 01:20:39,151
You know where you're taking us?

Yes.

01:20:50,954 --> 01:20:52,046
I know it.

776

Turn around and go back to camp.

I'll show you
what a Cheyenne does with a liar.

Get up. You're not hurt.

779
01:21:56,395 --> 01:21:58,648
Vause gave Tex and me the idea himself.

Let's ride.

Come on back there. Come on back there!

I shot his horse.
He'll come crawling back to us.

794
01:25:17,262 --> 01:25:18,809
Now, let's get this fire started.

795
01:25:22,058 --> 01:25:23,810
We got the horses, the grub and the guns.

796
01:25:23,935 --> 01:25:25,608
He can't live out there.

797
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:38,208
Damn wind!

798
01:25:38,325 --> 01:25:41,249
Horses can't stand it either.
Now, let's get this fire started.

799
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:51,592
What are you doing?

800
01:25:56,259 --> 01:25:58,261
(NEIGHING)

801
01:26:31,086 --> 01:26:32,929
I don't have any matches.

802
01:26:35,006 --> 01:26:37,429
I don't have any matches. No matches.

803
01:27:09,374 --> 01:27:11,923
(WIND HOWLING)

804
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:33,190
(WIND HAS DROPPED)

805
01:28:03,136 --> 01:28:04,513
(NEIGHING)

806
01:31:11,991 --> 01:31:13,993
Welcome home, Mr Starrett.

807
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:23,386
Wait a minute.

808
01:31:23,503 --> 01:31:26,382
I thought it best he stay here
while the soldiers will be around.

809
01:31:26,506 --> 01:31:29,134
I'd like to work for you, Mr Starrett,
if you'll have me.

810
01:31:32,595 --> 01:31:34,017
All right, Gene.

811
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:36,607
Then you won't need this.
