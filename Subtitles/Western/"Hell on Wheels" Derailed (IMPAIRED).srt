167
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,838
Woman, I am your business.

168
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,256
Oh, is that so?

169
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,241
Yeah, it is.

170
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:05,887
Well, give me your dang
dollar and let's get to it.

171
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,523
So, I gotta pay you
before we start now?

172
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,057
Yeah, that's right.

173
00:14:10,223 --> 00:14:11,827
'Cause I figure you'll
get yourself killed

174
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,436
before we even get started.

175
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,724
Uh-uh, Toole the one that
got himself killed.

176
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,230
Oh... what...

177
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,278
So are you some kinda
dangerous gunslinger now?

178
00:14:28,403 --> 00:14:29,494
Is that it?

179
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,981
Maybe.

180
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:33,831
I'm fixin' to be
an Injun fighter, too.

181
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:35,609
Get out of my crib.

182
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,543
What?
You heard me.

183
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:40,089
I don't want no dead man's trade.

184
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:44,027
Last I saw you, you barely
escaped a neck stretchin',

185
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:46,430
and you ride on outta
here and I figured

186
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:48,598
for certain they got you killed.

187
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,200
Now you come back,

188
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:52,725
traipsin' on in here
like you own the place?

189
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:55,728
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

190
00:14:57,232 --> 00:15:01,010
I am happy to see you, idiot.

191
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:02,401
I just said so.

192
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:10,577
Now, gimme that damn dollar.

193
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,763
How's your father?

194
00:15:31,032 --> 00:15:32,675
Very weak.

195
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,685
You'll have to tend to him.

196
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:37,447
Where are you going?

197
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,772
I'm going to help
them find my brother.

198
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:43,776
Your own brother?

199
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:47,280
He has to be stopped
before he starts a war.

200
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:52,910
Be careful... Joseph.

201
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,382
Will you just look at that?

202
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:54,305
An Injun, a nigger, and a Greyback.

203
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,558
We got ourselves a rainbow, boys.

204
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:03,731
Mount up.

205
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,329
Hyah!

206
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:50,714
{pub}There's no reason to panic, Lily.

207
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,384
I'm not, Thomas.

208
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,533
I'm simply moving out.

209
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:02,081
But... where will you go?

210
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,830
I still have our tent,
Robert's and mine.

211
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:07,465
I'll find a spot.

212
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,168
Are you mad?

213
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:12,091
Living amongst that rabble?

214
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:14,640
And we're under a threat
of an Indian attack.

215
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,109
It's too dangerous.
I won't have it.

216
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:19,223
That's not your decision to make.

217
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:24,562
Oh. I see.

218
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:32,069
I thought it significant that you
chose to come back here with me,

219
00:18:32,617 --> 00:18:35,698
but... I see I was mistaken.

220
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,400
I came back because I believe in you.

221
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:42,060
I believe in this railroad.

222
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:45,708
Together we can get it done.

223
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:49,420
But not together.

224
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,259
I'm sorry.

225
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,887
Hmm. So am I.

226
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:04,227
Taking you in...
Comforting you,

227
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:08,030
salving the memory
of Robert at every turn.

228
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:10,399
And for that I am eternally grateful.

229
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:15,696
Please, Thomas... can
we end this amiably?

230
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,914
You played me like
a fiddle, didn't you?

231
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,418
Right under my nose...

232
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,187
Where I could see you,
hear your voice,

233
00:19:31,312 --> 00:19:32,880
smell you every day.

234
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,346
I should go.

235
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:45,226
Ahem. Could you have Henri
help me with my things?

236
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:48,396
No.

237
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,234
Carry them yourself.

238
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,757
Hold!

239
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:38,863
We follow Little Bear Creek North
for a day and then head West.

240
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,990
How many in your father's camp?

241
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,202
50, maybe 60.

242
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:47,495
Mostly women and children.

243
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,998
Hmm.

244
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,668
Where are all the braves?

245
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,837
Out hunting.

246
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,797
And what about this Pawnee killer?

247
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,217
My father will know where he is.

248
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,887
He better.

249
00:21:08,577 --> 00:21:10,311
Think that was smart tellin' him

250
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,857
there's only women and
children at that camp?

251
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:15,792
What do you mean?

252
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,444
What if your father don't
give up Pawnee killer?

253
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,532
Lieutenant Griggs
gave me his guarantee.

254
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,535
So the white man gave
you his word, huh?

255
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:37,212
Lieutenant?

256
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:39,465
How we doing?

257
00:21:39,774 --> 00:21:41,842
Fine.

258
00:21:42,077 --> 00:21:44,845
Is that a Confederate Sabre
you got on your belt there?

259
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:47,932
Ha ha ha.
Yes, it is.

260
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:50,559
Where'd you get it?

261
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:53,312
Antietam.

262
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,356
Spoils of victory.

263
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,734
You call Sharpsburg a victory?

264
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:05,032
Antietam. And yeah, I do,
a glorious one.

265
00:22:06,634 --> 00:22:08,301
Mount up!

266
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,614
[Indistinct chatter]

267
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:48,993
That'll be 6 bits.

268
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,829
6 bits?

269
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:56,194
75 cents, unless, uh...

270
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,896
Unless you got
something else in mind.

271
00:22:59,021 --> 00:22:59,837
OK.

272
00:23:00,056 --> 00:23:02,923
What are you doing?

273
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,704
You can put it on my account.

274
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:08,173
All right, Eva. I'll be
back for it later.

275
00:23:08,298 --> 00:23:11,056
You know where I'll be. Now fly.

276
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,896
Thank you.

277
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:19,974
I'll pay you back.

278
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,385
When?

279
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:27,090
I, uh, I have a small purse of...

280
00:23:27,215 --> 00:23:29,293
Of coins somewhere.

281
00:23:29,418 --> 00:23:32,077
Yeah, don't worry about it for now.

282
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:34,997
First thing I'd do...
Is get you a carpenter

283
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,390
to lay you some floor boards.

284
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,936
Otherwise, you'll be saying
hello to Mr. trench foot.

285
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:41,472
I'm well acquainted with trench foot.

286
00:23:41,597 --> 00:23:44,576
I have spent a year
in the wilderness.

287
00:23:44,701 --> 00:23:49,114
I reckon you're a good sight tougher
than you look, ain't you, Mrs. Bell?

288
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,648
Please. Lily.

289
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:52,216
All right then, Lily...

290
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:56,120
I'd still suggest you puttin'
in them floor boards, though.

291
00:23:56,245 --> 00:23:57,936
'Course I had to throw my leg

292
00:23:58,102 --> 00:24:02,066
over that cross-eyed carpenter
twice before he got mine right.

293
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:13,368
Tell us about your glorious
victory at Sharpsburg, lieutenant.

294
00:24:19,134 --> 00:24:21,469
Antietam it is then.

295
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,456
I s with the 51st Pennsylvania.

296
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:33,972
Me and my boys
took the Burnside Bridge.

297
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:38,852
We softened them Rebs up with
a light howitzer from the East Bank.

298
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:42,501
Then we stormed that bridge
like hounds from hell.

299
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,817
Shoulda seen them Greybacks run.

300
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:47,528
Ha ha. Yes, sir.

301
00:24:47,765 --> 00:24:50,823
Them boys got the skinny end
of the horn that day.

302
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:55,994
I was on the other side
of the bridge that day.

303
00:24:58,276 --> 00:24:59,748
Is that so?

304
00:25:01,945 --> 00:25:03,446
Yep.

305
00:25:04,614 --> 00:25:08,257
You want to know why we retreated?

306
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,463
We was out of ammunition...

307
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:13,554
From killin' Yankees.

308
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:16,135
Now, don't get me wrong,

309
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,164
they were some brave men. Brave men.

310
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,810
General McClellan might
just as well have been

311
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:25,079
sending 'em up
against a firing squad.

312
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:31,318
They kept chargin'
and... we kept shootin',

313
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:34,116
like fish in a bloody barrel.

314
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:38,057
Time we was done,

315
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:41,165
there was a bridge of bodies
'cross that river.

316
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,330
Yeah.

317
00:25:43,455 --> 00:25:46,456
That must have been when
you finally come across.

318
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,840
When all the killin' was done.

319
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,302
Yeah.

320
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,844
We must've put down
500 Yankees that day.

321
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:59,137
So.

322
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,976
You want to call that
a glorious victory...

323
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,648
You go ahead.

324
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:11,653
500...

325
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:14,195
A thousand...

326
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,365
10,000.

327
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,366
It doesn't matter.

328
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:20,204
Hey!

329
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,039
Hey.

330
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,873
We won.

331
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:29,379
Ha ha.
And you lost.

332
00:26:29,545 --> 00:26:33,926
And I got the sword
right here to prove it.

333
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,940
Yeah.

334
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,109
Well...

335
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:42,487
I guess I'm just
gonna have to take it

336
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:43,822
off of you and shove
it up your ass, then.

337
00:26:43,947 --> 00:26:45,312
Yeah. Is that so?

338
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:47,731
Listen to me.

339
00:26:49,285 --> 00:26:50,692
Listen to me.

340
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:54,623
Sometimes you got to bite
the tongue and just take it.

Get up! Hey, hey, get up!

344
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,229

00:28:03,294 --> 00:28:04,891
Oh, sweet Jesus.

349
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:27,649
They took the horses.

350
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:32,096
Damn it to hell.

351
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:33,670
That damned father
of yours is pretty clever,

352
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:35,433
I'll give him that much.

353
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:37,090
My father had nothing
to do with this.

354
00:28:37,256 --> 00:28:40,205
[Sighs]
It was my brother.

355
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,174
Your brother?

356
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,342
This is his work.

357
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,945
What we saw out there, too.

358
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,647
This bloody renegade is your brother

359
00:28:48,772 --> 00:28:50,816
and you expect me to act
fairly with your father?

360
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:54,024
Hey! We got more important problems,

361
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,859
as in we got no horses.

362
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,389
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

363
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:59,124
Cullen: We need to turn
around and go back.

364
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:02,061
Griggs: The plan's unchanged.
We march into the village.

365
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:06,244
March? Are you crazy or just stupid?

366
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,002
You are welcome
to retreat, Mr. Bohannon.

367
00:29:09,127 --> 00:29:12,338
We don't need you.
Let's move out.

368
00:29:12,463 --> 00:29:14,797
Off the reel, gentlemen.

369
00:29:18,381 --> 00:29:19,677
We need to go back.

370
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:21,246
Following this guy's
gonna be suicide.

371
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:24,782
No. We split up,
we'll be easier targets.

372
00:29:24,907 --> 00:29:27,015
It's what my brother wants.

373
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:38,110
Hey. Hey!

374
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,821
I need to know
where you stand right now.

375
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,656
How you mean?

376
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,104
Pawnee killer's fighting
a rear guard action,

377
00:29:45,229 --> 00:29:46,506
trying to buy some
time for his village,

378
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:47,953
which means they ain't left yet.

379
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,342
What if we get there and
them Injuns still here?

380
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:53,146
Griggs ain't gonna be in no
talkin' mood, that's for sure.

381
00:29:53,271 --> 00:29:55,794
Well, I sure as hell ain't gonna
kill no women and no children.

382
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,740
You just be ready.

383
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:02,110
We might end up finding them blue
coats instead of the Cheyenne.

384
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,111
{pub}Father?

385
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,447
I brought you some soup.

386
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:43,383
Mother told me this was
always your one true love.

387
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:51,350
I was only little...
But I remember the screaming at night.

388
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:55,479
I remember the bruises
on her face in the morning.

389
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:03,528
After you left,
she was always afraid you'd come back...

390
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:08,493
But never stopped praying you would.

391
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:13,914
She never stopped loving you.

392
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:23,423
Have you nothing to say?

393
00:31:24,845 --> 00:31:27,680
Leave me alone.

394
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:33,099
No. You're the one
who leaves, remember?

395
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:37,956
Here. Let me.

396
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:43,295
Here, drink it.

397
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:55,830
I am not my mother.

398
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:01,481
I'm not afraid of you.

399
00:33:20,993 --> 00:33:24,338
What the hell are you up to, son?

400
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:25,607
What do you mean?

401
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:27,375
This is just a different
bend in the same river.

402
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,911
Skirted it twice, now
back out and back in.

403
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:30,646
The Pawnee killer would have
had time to tell your father

404
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,302
about the derailment by now.

405
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,118
You're just buying time for
your village to escape, ain't ya?

406
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:36,181
What do you care?

407
00:33:36,444 --> 00:33:38,020
You gonna get the rest of us killed

408
00:33:38,145 --> 00:33:39,768
out here leadin' us in circles.

409
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,311
That's a risk I'm willing to take.

410
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:45,159
So you never intended to go
after Pawnee killer, did you?

411
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:47,261
That's not true.

412
00:33:47,386 --> 00:33:49,694
I just wanted to make sure
my family was safe first.

You're just wasting ammunition.

Why ain't they attacking us?

421
00:34:12,144 --> 00:34:13,921
They will.

422
00:34:14,046 --> 00:34:15,814

were captured by Indians.

It was a sunny day.

00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:42,843
They hacked up my mom
and dad, scalped 'em.

441

Raped my little sister
and smashed her brains out with rocks.

No, please.

But I was lucky.

00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,491
Had the pox.

446
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,665
They wouldn't touch me.
Traded me off to some Mojave.

447
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,170
They was a cake walk compared to
what the Yavapai would have been.

448
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:11,641
I have these terrible nightmares...

449
00:36:11,766 --> 00:36:13,768
About the Indian I killed.

450
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,980
It's because his spirit's wandering.

451
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:18,843
It's reaching out to you.

452
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:22,685
Yes. And in the dream he...

Don't let him get you.

He's trying to drag you onto
the path to the dead world.

00:36:30,551 --> 00:36:32,527
It seems so real when it happens.

It is real.

458

When a woman kills a brave...

459
00:36:39,927 --> 00:36:42,534
It invites big magic.

00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:08,726
If the Indians don't
attack us tonight,

462
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:10,478
I want to start work again tomorrow.

463
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:13,672
Mr. Durant, Bohannon is a killer.

464
00:37:13,797 --> 00:37:16,408
I can prove it. Look at these
papers I found in his tent.

465
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:20,945
Right now Mr. Bohannon is hunting
the Indians who attacked us.

466
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,547
Your job is to get
the men back to work.

467
00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:25,307
Ya, ya. In Washington, ya?

468
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,586
Now in Washington he killed. Huh?

469
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:32,290
Now, Johnson knew he killed,
so he killed Johnson.

470
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:34,210
Mr. Gundersen.
Hmm?

471
00:37:34,376 --> 00:37:38,097
We will post a relay
of sentries out to the cut.

472
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:41,134
Arm everyone.
The work must continue.

473
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,972
No. He is not done killing, ya?

474
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,540
Now, look at this.

475
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:49,310
He's looking for others among
us. Look at these names.

476
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:53,982
Listen to me,
half the men out there are killers.

477
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,784
Half of them are accomplices.

478
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:58,276
They are all afraid of Bohannon.

479
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:02,071
He is an agent of progress,

480
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:05,826
an asset to me in this endeavor, hmm?

481
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,762
Whatever his motivations.

482
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:11,332
Now, you will feed
this fantasy of revenge

483
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,124
into the stove.

484
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,701
Tomorrow, God willing,

485
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,378
we will resume work on my railroad.

486
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:18,672
Ya.

487
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,798
Mr. Durant.

488
00:38:23,292 --> 00:38:27,622
It's a long walk through Indian
territory to Sweden, Mr. Gundersen.

489
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,850
Sweden?

490
00:38:45,326 --> 00:38:47,928
I am from Norway.

491
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,765
I am Norwegian.
